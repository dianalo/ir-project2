The amendments reduce permissibleexposure limits for approximately 100 substances now listed in the ``Z-tables,''raise the permissible exposure limit for 1 substance, set permissible exposurelimits for 205 substances currently not regulated by OSHA, add or changeSTEL's for 70 substances, and, as appropriate, set skin, short-term orceiling limits.OSHA has reviewed health evidence for all these substances and has determinedthat the new limits substantially reduce a risk of deleterious health effectsamong American workers, including cancers, central and peripheral neuropathies,lung disease, liver and kidney damage and other systemic effects. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing revisions to these levels.In the final rule, after review of all the evidence in the record OSHAwill establish new levels which it determines will substantially reducesignificant risks.It has also preliminary concluded, based on a review of many data basesand an extensive survey, that the new limits are feasible. To assist inits analysis, OSHA has utilized the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health-Recommended Exposure Limits (NIOSH-REL's) and the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists-Threshold Limit Values(ACGIH-TLV) published in 1987-88, as the starting points in its review.OSHA will continue its practice of rulemaking for individual substanceswhen regulations of that type are necessary and appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments on the proposed standard must be postmarkedon or before July 8, 1988.

Background</ITAG>A. Questions Solicited for NPRMOSHA requests comments on all issues raised by this proposal includinghealth effects, feasibility, risk and policy issues. The following aresome specific questions which may assist commenters in their review.1. Are substances included which should be excluded from this rulemaking?2. Is additional health and feasibility documentation available relativeto the proposed PEL's, beyond that described in the preamble?3. Are substances included in this rulemaking used in industries otherthan those described in the preamble?4. Are substances included in this rulemaking used for purposes other thanthose described in the preamble?5. Do alternative unpublished exposure guidelines exist, such as thoseused in private workplaces, which may be suitable for general usage?6. Is there information regarding laboratory analytical procedures whichmay be used in lieu of those suggested by OSHA (See Appendix A) to determineexposure to air contaminants?7. Are the proposed exposure limits for each substance appropriate?8. Is additional information available for those substances for which ACGIHproposed a higher TLV which might affect OSHA's decision that such a changewas not justified?9. Should the implementation dates for some substances be delayed becauseof sampling/analytical limitations or short term feasibility impact considerations?10. Is there additional information relative to the OSHA plans to adoptsome recommended 10 hour TWA REL's as an 8-hour TWA PEL?11. Does the most current scientific information generally support acceptanceof the hypothesis that all C-5-8-Alkanes are <T3>not</T3> equally toxic because a metabolite of n-Hexane exhibits uniqueneurotoxic properties?12. OSHA has proposed to use exposure limits from two well-establishedsets of guidelines as a source of values to update the PEL's. Is informationavailable about alternative sources which OSHA might consider for thispurpose?13. OSHA has outlined its criteria for identifying special situations.Are alternative criteria available which might be used in lieu of these,or in addition to them?14. OSHA has outlined three alternative procedures for dealing with substancesrequiring special attention. Are additional approaches available whichmight be used in lieu of these, or in addition to them?15. OSHA has performed feasibility analysis for the following substances,based on limited available information:<ITAG tagnum="15">Acetonitrile</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon disulfide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon monoxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon tetrachloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloroform</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethylene dichloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ethylene glycol dinitrate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Fibrous glass dust</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hydrogen cyanide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Isophorone diisocyanate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Nitrogen dioxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Nitroglycerin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trichloroethylene</ITAG>Is further information available which might be used to supplement thepresent findings regarding the feasibility of achieving these levels inthe workplaces?16. OSHA has made a preliminary assessment of the proposed rulemakings'impact on large and small establishments. The Act requires OSHA to determinewhether a regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3> Is there additional information regarding implementationof this rule for small businesses and entities which OSHA should consider?17. OSHA has proposed PEL's for some substances, where the basis for thisproposal also includes a carcinogenicity designation (e.g., TLV with aA1 or A2 designation; REL with a Ca designation). Should OSHA include asimilar carcinogen designation in the  Z-4 Table in this rulemaking?18. OSHA has preliminarily decided that for substances where the ACGIH,TLV is a TWA and the NIOSH, REL is a Ceiling Value which is the same orone half of the TWA, OSHA will propose that the TWA be adopted as the PEL.Should this approach be modified in the final rulemaking? What approachshould be used when the converse of this situation (TLV, Ceiling-REL, TWA)exists?19. OSHA preliminarily plans to adopt a phased start-up schedule. Thiswould include an initial start-up requirement permitting the use of alternatecontrol methods for revised PEL's, followed at a later date by the requireduse of control methods fully consistent with the methods of compliancepriorities in effect at that time. OSHA will shortly be requesting commentson the hierarchy of controls. An alternate approach is to set compliancedate for engineering controls based on final determinations of that rulemaking.OSHA solicits comments on those approaches and suggestions regarding appropriatetimes for the two proposed start-up dates.20. OSHA requests comment on whether the establishment of margins of safetybelow lowest observed or no effect levels is consistent with the conceptof ``significant risk,'' and on whether the specific margins of safetyproposed for specific chemicals are appropriate.21. OSHA has identified sensory irritation, which causes rhinitis, cough,sputum production, chest pain, wheezing and dyspnea as material impairmentof health. OSHA invites comments on this understanding.22. The question also arises of whether odorants present material impairmentof health. That issue also might arise in the context of other substances.Based on the evidence in the final record concerning this issue, OSHA willdetermine if the criteria detailed in section IV-C-16 have been met, andtake appropriate action. OSHA requests comment on this issue.  23. Is there exposure information available which can be supplied whichwill refine OSHA's estimates of employee exposures and overexposures tothe substances being regulated?  24. Is there information available which can be supplied to improve orsupplement the engineering controls identified as necessary in order toreduce exposure levels? Is there additional cost data which can be suppliedto refine the annual costs associated with these controls?  25. Under what conditions, involving which industrial processes, will respiratorsbe needed during the start up period, for maintenance operations, or whereother controls are infeasible in order to protect employees at the proposedexposure levels? Are respirators currently being used under the conditionsidentified, or would they need to be purchased? Please describe the typeof respirator currently in use or needed.  26. As a result of simultaneously regulating many substances, what costsavings will be realized in purchasing new engineering controls? Are alternateengineering controls available to achieve the lower permissible exposurelimits being proposed? 27. What is the current state of technology control and financing in firmswhich would need to comply with reduced exposure limits to wood dust? B. History and Need for Revision of the PEL's    One of the principal reasons, if not the single most important basis, forCongress passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, was Congress'recognition of the need to protect workers from occupational health hazards.In the preamble to the Act, Congress stated one of the purposes was toprotect employees by ``exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishingcausal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions,and conduct other research relating to health problems, in recognitionof the fact the that <T3>occupations health standards present problems often different fromthose involved in occupational safety.</T3>'' (emphasis added).  The legislative history indicates Congressional concern for reduction inhealth risk from both the recognized hazards and from the many newly utilizedchemicals. Congress stated in 1970,<ITAG tagnum="21">In the field of occupational health the view is particularly bleak,and due to the lack of information and records, may well be considerablyworse than we currently know. Occupational diseases which first commandedattention at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution are still underminingthe health of workers. Substantial numbers, even today, fall victim toto ancient industrial poisons such as lead and mercury. Workers in thedusty trades still contract various respiratory diseases. Other materialsin industrial use are only now being discovered to have toxic effects.In addition, technological advances and new processes in American industryhave brought numerous new hazards to the workplace. Carcinogenic chemicals,lasers, ultrasonic energy, beryllium metal, epoxy resins, pesticides, amongothers, all present incipient threats to the health of workers. Indeed,new materials and processes are being introduced into industry at a muchfaster rate than the present meager resources of occupational health cankeep up with. It is estimated that every 20 minutes a new and potentiallytoxic chemical is introduced into industry. New processes and new resourcesof energy present occupational health problems of unprecedented complexity.(Senate Report 91-1282, p. 2)</ITAG>To accomplish the goal of protecting workers from occupationally relateddisease Congress created a three-pronged approach in the OSH Act.  First, Congress desired that OSHA, as soon as possible after it was established,have in existence a set of basic, minimum health and safety standards.To accomplish this it provided in section 6(a) of the OSH Act that OSHAshould adopt within its first two years, without hearing or public comment,established federal standards and national consensus standards.  At that time, under the Walsh-Healey Act, The Department of Labor had adoptedfor government contractors approximately 400 health standards based onthe Threshold Limit Value (TLV) recommendations of the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygientists (ACGIH). Those were adopted as establishedfederal standards. In addition about 25 additional exposure limits hadbeen recommended by the American Standards Association (presently calledthe American National Standards Institute). Those were adopted as nationalconsensus standards. OSHA adopted these initial exposure limits in May1971. They are for the most part the maximum air contaminant levels setforth in Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 of 29 CFR 1910.1000.  Congress recognized the need to update these standards. It created twomechanisms for updating health standards: Regular or ``6(b)'' standardsand emergency or ``6(c)'' standards.  Congress specified the procedures for regular standards in sections 6(b)(1)-(4) and 6(f). They provide that: The public may petition for new standards;OSHA may set up an advisory committee; and, before issuing a standard,OSHA must publish a proposal with an explanatory preamble, request publiccomments and publish an explanatory preamble with the final standard. Inaddition to these general requirements of informal rulemaking, Congressspecified that OSHA must hold an oral hearing if requested and supportits determination with substantial evidence in the rulemaking record. Congress set forth the criteria for health standards in section 6(b)(5)of its Act. This stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materialsor harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standardwhich most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis ofthe best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairmentof health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposuresto the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his workinglife. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based uponresearch, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as maybe appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree ofhealth and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shallbe the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility ofthe standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safetylaws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressedin terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.</ITAG>Congress also provided in section 6(c) for the issuance of Emergency TemporaryStandards (ETS) to take immediate effect without rulemaking. However, OSHAis to issue a proposal and complete a section 6(b) rulemaking within 6months. The criteria for issuing an ETS is that ``employers are exposedto grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to betoxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and that such emergencystandard is necessary to protect employees from that danger.'' OSHA hasfound that section 6(c) procedures have not generally accelerated the regulatoryprocess. Most ETS's have been litigated, and judicial stays have been issuedeither on procedural or substantive grounds.Since the passage of the Act in 1970, OSHA has made substantial progressimproving the occupational health of workers for some priority health hazards.Asbestos and arsenic exposures have been dramatically reduced, substantiallyreducing cancer risk to employees. Lead exposures have been reduced andwe are now seeing a major reduction in employee blood lead levels, andlead related diseases. Cotton dust exposures have been reduced and byssinosishas been nearly eliminated from the textile work force. OSHA has also substantiallyreduced significant health risk from some of the newer chemicals such asethylene oxide and vinyl chloride.Through the hazard communication and access to employee exposure and medicalrecords standards, OSHA has greatly expanded the ability of employees tolearn about and protect themselves from health hazards.OSHA's standards have proven to be feasible, often costing less than estimated.The vinyl chloride standard cost one-tenth OSHA's contractor's estimate.The cotton dust standard has been credited with improving the industry'scompetitiveness and productivity while costing one-half OSHA's estimate.The preambles to OSHA standards have been lengthy, detailed and sophisticated.They have thoroughly analyzed health studies and controversial scientificissues about carcinogencity and risk assessment. Extensive analyses offeasibility have been made.OSHA has issued only 24 substance-specific health regulations since itscreation. It has not been able to review the many thousands of currentlyunregulated chemicals in the workplace nor to keep up with reviewing theseveral thousand new chemicals introduced since its creation. It has notbeen able to fully review the literature to determine if lower limits areneeded for many of the approximately 400 substances it now regulates.Using past approaches and practices, OSHA could continue to regulate asmall number of the high priority substances and those of greatest publicinterest. However, it would take decades to review currently used chemicalsand OSHA would never be able to keep up with the many chemicals which willbe newly introduced in the future.OSHA believes it is a major priority to update its existing PEL's and tomake a substantial effort to control exposure to chemicals newly used inthe workplace for which no exposure limits exist. The existing health literatureand expert judgment indicate that such new or lower limits are needed toprotect against many types of deleterious health effects. These includekidney and liver diseases, respiratory diseases, reductions in lung function,nerve disorders and reduction in nerve function, carcinogenicity, irritationto the eyes, throat, skin and other organs which prevent working safelyand many other disorders and dysfunctions.As the preliminary regulatory analysis indicates, millions of employeesin total are exposed to levels of these chemicals which, the literatureor expert opinion indicates, do or may create deleterious health effects.Clearly, it is a most important occupational health priority to reduceor eliminate such disease and material impairments of health.Congress clearly indicated that it was a major Congressional priority toconsider and control, when needed, the many thousands of unregulated chemicals,and update the existing Z-Table chemicals. For example, the previous quotationindicated Congress' concern with the thousands of newly introduced chemicals.Congress also stated.<ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, it is essential that such standards (Table Z chemicals)be constantly improved and replaced as new knowledge and techniques aredeveloped. In addition there are occupational hazards, particularly thoseaffecting health_which are not covered by any standards at all. (SenateReport 91-1282, p. 6).</ITAG>Government agencies and professional organizations have also recommendedthat OSHA lower exposures for many Table-Z substances and add limits forcurrently unregulated substances. The National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health has recommended new or lower exposure limits for approximately160 chemicals (REL's) in its Recommendations for Occupational Safety andHealth Standards, September 1986.The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) 1987-88Threshold Limit Values (TLV's) adopted new exposure limits for approximately200 substances not regulated by OSHA, and lower limits, short-term exposurelimits, ceiling or skin limits for approximately 200 substances now regulatedby OSHA.In light of its priority to address the many unregulated health hazardsand improve the existing Table Z limits, OSHA commenced a review processto determine the best way to achieve this goal. It has reviewed its pasthistory and set up an internal task force to consider the matter. OSHArequested the Administrative Conference of the United States to study theissue and make recommendations.In other rulemakings, important factors as discussed below led OSHA toperform detailed analyses, consider all possible issues, write lengthypreambles and have extensive administrative procedures. However, in OSHA'sview, to review and regulate many substances in a reasonable period requiressome narrowing of the issues, focus of analysis, and reducing the lengthof the discussions in the preamble.The factors that led to OSHA's detailed approach to analysis are clearfrom OSHA's history: when OSHA issued a health standard it would be suedboth by industry arguing its health standards were too strict and by unionsarguing tis standards were not strict enough. For example, in 1974, OSHAissued standards for 14 carcinogens (39 FR 3756; Jan. 29, 1974). Industrysued, claiming that OSHA's procedures were inadequate and various studieswere poorly done. The unions sued arguing that OSHA had not set a no detectableexposure level, had not set up a permit system and had not set detailedenough requirements for medical examinations. See <T3>Synthetic Organic Chemical Mfgs. v. Brennan; Oil Chemical andamp; AtomicWorkers </T3>v. <T3>Brennan, </T3>503 F.2d 1155, 506 F2d 385 (3rd Cir. 1974).More recently industry challenged the ethylene oxide standard as beingtoo low and the unions challenged the same standard for not including ashort term exposure limit (STEL). See <T3>Public Citizen Health Research Group et al v. Tyson</T3>;<T3> Assoc. of Ethylene Oxide Users v. Tyson, </T3>796 F. 2d 1479 (D.C.Cir. 1986).OSHA also found that lengthy discussions of what it perceived were majorissues and less detailed discussion of what it perceived to be minor issuesor issues which could wait until another day sometimes resulted in a courtremand. For example, the preambles to the final lead standard were over100 <T4>Federal Register </T4>pages (43 FR 52952, Nov. 14, 1978; 43 FR 54354,Nov. 21, 1978) and included extensive health and feasibility discussions.However, the feasibility discussions were brief for those segments of industrywhich OSHA believed had fewer problems. The court generally upheld thestandard but remanded for reconsideration some of those segments. (SeeOSHA's similar experience for <T3>Asbestos, Building and Construction Trades vs. Brock, </T3>86-1359(D.C. Circ., Feb. 2, 1988)) <T3>United States Workers </T3>v.<T3> Marshall </T3>647 F. 2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Energetic industrychallenges, difficulties in gathering detailed data and some lengthy agencyreviews have resulted in a major commitment of OSHA resources, numeroushearings and several <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, in attempting to complete this remand.In another example, a court did not accept the agency's decision to intiallylimit the hazard communication regulation to the manufacturing sector thoughthe standard as issued created major employee protection benefits. <T3>United Steelworkers </T3>v. <T3>Auchter, </T3>763 F. 2d 728 (3rd Cir. 1985.).The success of a project to regulate a large backlog of chemicals for whichthere is a generally recognized need for new or improved employee protectionrequires some recognition of the need for agency flexibility in severalareas. One is in narrowing the scope of the issues to be covered. A secondis in less detailed discussion for each substance. Third is in the flexibilitynot to cover some issues at the present time when administrative resourcesare not available to consider them. In the future when resources are available,the Agency will decide whether the issues have priority.OSHA, in its first 17 years has also had to address difficult scientific,feasibility and policy issues. These include extrapolation from animaldata to humans, (ETO supra), epidemiology risk assessment and significantrisk analysis (Arsenic, 48 FR 1864, Jan. 14, 1983; Asbestos, 51 FR 22612,June 20, 1986), feasibility for industries with aging facilities (lead,arsenic, supra), lowest feasible level (Benzene, 52 FR 34460, Sept. 11,1987, for example) and others.In response to both the court challenges and the need to face difficultissues, OSHA has engaged in detailed and extensive analyses. These haveresulted in lengthier preamble discussions and in-depth analyses for allissues. For example, the 1986 asbestos final standard as published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>had a 100 page explanatory preamble for generalindustry. The original asbestos Sec. 6(b) standard had a 2 page preamble(37 FR 11318, June 7, 1972).Now that OSHA has reviewed these issues in depth several times, has experience``gained under this * * * law'' (sec. 6(b)(5)) on these issues, and hashad its analysis upheld in the Courts, somewhat less detailed chemical-by-chemicalanalyses should be appropriate. The accumulated judicial guidance and agencyexperience reduces the need for as extensive a discussion of some of theissues.Overall, this preamble is lengthy and both the scientific and feasibilityanalyses are longer than in previous OSHA rulemaking. OSHA is fully meetingthe requirements to analyze significant risk and feasibility. However,the analyses for each chemical are briefer than that provided as part ofindividual rulemaking.OSHA has also followed the more extensive administrative procedure of whatis called hybrid rulemaking rather than the minimum requirements of informalrulemaking. (See the OSHA procedural rules in 29 CFR Part 1911.) This includesoral hearings, questioning by the public in hearings, extensive right tocomment, decision based on an identified record and an Administrative LawJudge presiding at hearings.As discussed above, in part this is a requirement of the OSHA Act. However,it also reflects relevant legal doctrine. See <T3>International Harvester v. Ruckleshouse. </T3>478F 2d 615 (D.C. Cir.1973). This approach has served OSHA well by increasing the Agency's knowledge,and gaining commendation from the courts. See <T3>Industrial Union Dept. v. Hodgson, </T3>499 F. 2d 467 (D.C. Circ. 1974).It has also been commended in the academic community.OSHA is not short-cutting its administrative procedures in this matter.However, it is, of course, covering more territory in a single proposalfor exposure limits than it has previously. (OSHA's hazard communicationregulation, which also has very wide scope, was covered in a single proceedingand was upheld.) This method seems reasonable to OSHA in light of the natureof its proposal and its past experience. Also the Supreme Court in <T3>Vermont Yankee </T3>v. <T3>N.R.D.C., </T3>435, U.S. 519, 543.44 (1798) has indicated that agencieshave broad flexibility in devising appropriate administrative procedures.It stated that: ``administrative agencies should be free to fashion theirown rules of procedure, and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permittingthem to discharge their multitudinous duties.<T3/>Additional factors which have affected the number of health standards issuedby OSHA include various policies of Congress and the President. OSHA developsEnvironmental Impact Statements as required by the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act, conducts Regulatory Flexibility Analyses as required by theRegulatory Flexibility Act and conducts detailed analysis required by thePaperwork Reduction Act. All of the Presidents during OSHA's existencehave stressed the need to reduce inflation and improve the cost effectivenessof regulations. Under various Executive Orders (E.O. 12044, 12291) OSHAhas been required to perform extensive economic analyses. OSHA, of course,must continue to carry out these important goals of Congress and the President.As mentioned, OSHA consulted with the Administrative Conference of theUnited States on appropriate procedures to face the issue of the largenumber of chemicals which needed new exposure limits. The Conference issuedtwo lengthy reports of a study by two professors of administrative law.After extensive consideration, it made two sets of recommendations to OSHA,Recommendation 87-1, 52 FR 23629 (1987) and 87-10, 92 FR 40147 (Dec. 30,1987).The Administrative Conference specifically recommended:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Updating the 1971 Consensus Standards. The Occupational Safetyand Health Administration, as an interim step should continue to updatethe Table Z national consensus standards adopted in 1971 if updating canbe accomplished by expedited rulemaking procedure (e.g., including moreconcise preambles) appropriate to the nature of the revised Table. OSHAshould update the 1971 standards on a generic basis (i.e., include multiplestandards in one proceeding) when consensus recommendations are available,which are generally accepted by employers and workers in the affected industries,and when the new standards can be evaluated on the basis of risk and feasibilityinformation reasonably available to the Agency. This interim step shouldnot interfere with OSHA's continuing responsibility to promulgate and modifysafety and health standards.</ITAG>As this discussion indicates there is clear and generally recognized needto improve occupational health protection of workers from a substantialnumber of chemicals which are present in the workplace. Clearly an improvedapproach to regulation is needed to solve this problem in a reasonabletime period. OSHA has reviewed the law, Congressional intent, its history,and the recommendations of experts. Based on this review, OSHA has adoptedthe approach reflected in this proposal and described in greater detailin the approach section below.OSHA believes that the proposal will lead to a major improvement in occupationalhealth, probably the greatest improvement it can achieve in a short periodof time. Consequently, it believes it is justified to make, as one of itsfirst priorities, reducing exposure to approximately 400 substances. Itbelieves it is appropriate to leave for later standards and a second stage,of somewhat lower priority, more detailed analyses of some substances,where lower limits may be appropriate, and review of the need for medical,monitoring and industrial hygiene provisions is required.C. ApproachThis proposed rulemaking represents a different OSHA approach to the problemof setting permissible exposure limits for the wide variety of potentiallyhazardous substances present in the work place. Under typical section 6(b)rulemaking, OSHA has developed detailed standards for individual substancesbased on an extensive review of all available information. This is an extremelytime and resource-intensive process. In the proposed rulemaking, OSHA willrely to a large extent on the evaluation of other existing exposure limitswhich have been developed and widely accepted as health protection guidelines,recommendations, or regulations together with an evaluation of the moreimportant studies for each substance. These sources have been developedby various organizations within and outside the United States.Analysis of all these guidelines clearly documented the inadequacies ofthe existing Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL), defined in the andSection;1910.1000 Z-Tables, which were all developed prior to 1968. Further analysisidentified two sources, the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists, Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH/TLV) and the National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health, Recommended Exposure Limits (NIOSH/REL's),which could be used in this rulemaking. The TLV's were used to identifythose substances to be considered in this rulemaking. Both the REL's andTLV's were used to permit OSHA to determine which limits provide a moreappropriate permissible exposure limit in light of the evidence and thestatutory requirements OSHA must follow. A detailed explanation of thisanalysis is provided in a separate section of this preamble. The justificationsfor limiting this proposed rulemaking to the question of allowable airconcentrations, without considering ancillary requirements, such as controlmethods, personal protective equipment, training, etc., are described ina separate section of this preamble.While OSHA has relied extensively on the guidance provided by the documentationfor the ACGIH TLV's and NIOSH REL's, OSHA has also reviewed other healtheffects data to determine, as the OSHA Act requires, if significant risksexist; if the new exposure limits would substantially reduce that risk;and if technological and economic feasibility exists for the proposed PEL's.OSHA has concentrated its efforts on reviewing summaries of the major studies,with emphasis on the literature used to support the exposure limits proposedby NIOSH and ACGIH for the several hundred substances being consideredin this proposed rulemaking. With this approach, it is not necessary toanalyze in depth all available studies for each substance. When the studiessupport the recommended level within the context of OSHA's legal requirements,OSHA is proposing to adopt either the TLV or REL, rather than attempt adetailed analysis. The details of the approach used to resolve differencesbetween individual permissible exposure limits are provided in anothersection of the preamble. This preamble will discuss the health effectsand risk for each substance being considered.OSHA is also engaging in an extensive analysis of technological and economicfeasibility. OSHA is utilizing: A review of the literature; expert professionaljudgement by a selected group of certified industrial hygienists and professionalengineers; a large scale survey of past experiences in the work place;and input from several computer-processable data bases to determine whetherthe proposed levels are technologically and economically feasible. Thesurvey will be focused by using existing exposure sampling data which indicateusage and the level of compliance already achieved. OSHA is not attemptingto analyze the feasibility of alternative proposed exposure levels exceptwhere the TLV and REL differ significantly. In those instances only theREL and TLV are considered. However, the absence of adequate feasibilityinformation for a given TLV or REL will eliminate that exposure level fromconsideration as a possible OSHA PEL.To attain the objectives of the proposed rulemaking, it has been necessaryto limit the discussion of health effects for each individual substance.To use this approach, and satisfy the technical and legal requirementsfor section 6(b) rulemaking, OSHA has identified 15 health effect categoriesto include all the substances considered in the rulemaking. While somesubstances have health effects which fall into more than one category,for purposes of organization, OSHA has grouped the substances accordingto the ACGIH rationale for identifying the primary health effect. For eachof these groups there is a generic discussion of the general health effectsconsiderations which lead to the development of permissible air concentrationsfor those substances falling within that category. This is then supplementedby a limited discussion of: health effects, significance of risk, and riskreduction for each substance, primarily based on the TLV and REL documentation.In each instance, OSHA reaches its own conclusion regarding which (if either)of these limits are appropriate. OSHA is also considering other relevantguidelines for allowable air concentrations to identify any specific substanceswhich require special attention.This preamble will include the generic discussions for all 15 health effectsgroups, and an evaluation of the specific substances.OSHA anticipates that there are three possible outcomes for the proposedPEL's in this proposal. These are:(1) The final rule adopts the proposed limits.(2) The final rule adopts limits different from the existing or proposedlimits.(3) The final rule adopts no changes to the existing limits.To make a decision between these three alternatives, OSHA will considerthree types of information.(a) Facts, objectively defined on the basis of information now available.(b) Policy judgment consistent with the statutory requirements the Agencymust follow.(c) Assessment of the record presented during or as a result of the publichearing scheduled for this rulemaking. This assessment of the record willconsider both factual and policy information.Specific evidence which OSHA will consider includes the following:Number of exposed employees at various exposure levels, number of manufacturingprocesses involved, quantity of material involved, cost of compliance,type of effect (e.g., acute, chronic), severity of health effects, absenceof an existing PEL, magnitude of proposed change to PEL, general acceptanceof proposed PEL, and quality of the evidence.OSHA will use all these criteria in reaching its final decisions basedon statutory requirements for each of the substances currently includedin the proposal.In most previous health rulemakings subsequent to the benzene decisionOSHA has regulated health hazards which have posed risks above 1 in a thousandover a working lifetime. These are clearly in the range of risks whichthe agency generally considers ``significant.'' These risks have been quantifiedthrough risk assessments using accepted statistical techniques. In mostof these rulemakings, the limits of the agency's action have been determinedby the constraint of feasibility, meaning that significant risks were likelyto remain at the new levels, according to the quantitative risk assessments,but that further reductions in exposures were feasible. In the formaldehydefinal rulemaking OSHA stated that regarding the question of significantrisk, it ``believes that figures of 0.6 per 100,000 (i.e., 6 in one million)predicted by the lower end of the range may be approaching a level thatcan be viewed as safe in the context of the workplace environment.Most of OSHA's prior standards have involved chronic health hazards wherestudies have identified risks at relatively high levels of exposure. OSHAutilized standard risk assessment models to estimate risks at lower levelsof exposure. It used these estimates as the basis for significant riskdeterminations at existing and proposed levels.Many of the substances OSHA is regulating in this proposed rulemaking areacute hazards. Studies indicate that workers may suffer health effect ata level close to the current exposure limit, or if not exposure limit exists,at a specific level. With data close to the level of interest, extensiveextrapolation is not necessary and the primary question is what level willsubstantially reduce or eliminate the significant risk identified.OSHA is relying on guidelines already available in the literature, whichuse a variety of adjustments to account for the uncertainties inherentin translating animal or human health studies to the actual work situation.Adjustments are required due to inter-species and intra-species variations,sex and age differences, and the limited statistical power of typical studies.Statistical power is frequently limited because of the small number oftest subjects, and the time constraints regarding single or repeated exposures.For the same reason the available studies may not support precise quantitativeestimates of the probability of adverse health effects. In these situations,even where the presence of risk is well-established at the current level,it may not be possible to reach a conclusion concerning the precise pointat which that risk ceases to be significant, in other words, how far exposurelimits should be reduced. However, the evidence may be sufficient to justifya specific level as substantially reducing or eliminating significant risk.The Supreme Court has indicated that the decision about whether a particularlevel of risk is significant will be based on largely on policy considerations.OSHA will include in the final rule only those limits which the recordsupports as being consistent with the statutory requirement that OSHA mustfollow. In carrying out this responsibility OSHA will consider the qualityof the evidence, the type of risk, the reasonableness of the risk assessmentor evidence of risk, the substantial reduction or elimination of significantrisk, and the appropriateness of the final limit, taking into account statutoryrequirements, the cost and compliance factors, and policy considerations.Where more information is required to support a new final rule, the agencywill collect it before revising existing limits or establishing new limits.Policy discretion is particularly appropriate where risk appears to bein the range where the question of its insignificance is presented.OSHA is proposing to regulate 428 chemicals in this proceeding. In developingnew PELs for some of these chemicals, questions may arise about the pointat which the risks associated with them become insignificant. (See thediscussion about formaldehyde quoted above.) EPA and FDA have recentlyconsidered analogous issues under other statutory authorities, specifically,what levels of risk are sufficiently low so that no further regulatoryaction is necessary or where there is more discretion whether to take actionor not.The FDA has indicated that in its view, risks of less than one in one-millionfrom a lifetime of exposure are <T3>de minimus.</T3> See 51 FR 28344 at 362 August 7, 1986 and <T3>Public Citizen</T3> v.<T3> Young,</T3> 831 F. 2d 1108 (D.C. Cir., 1987). ``FDA's proposed one-in-onemillion dividing point has been used by EPA to distinguish acceptable andunacceptable risks. 119 FR 46294 (1984) (general guideline); 51 FR 1602,1635 (1986) (hazardous wastes). FDA has used the same break point to determinewhether the general safety clause of the Act applies. 47 FR 14 138 (1982)``<T3>Public Citizen,</T3> Note 4 ibid. Public comment is invited on howOSHA should, as a matter of policy, address these issues.Policy discretion concerning the appropriate extent of regulation if anymay be particularly appropriate where risk appears to be in the range betweenclearly significant and <T3>de minimus,</T3> when the question of its insignificance is presented.One area of such discretion may be whether ancillary provisions are appropriatewhen risk is in this middle range. For example, medical screening testsmay not be as effective, or the side effects may outweigh their value whenthe predicted risk is relatively low, and it is of value to focus medicalresources where these have greater value. See, for example, discussionof medical surveillance for OSHA's arsenic standard, 43 FR 19620-1 (May5, 1978) and benzene standard, 52 FR 34547-54 (September 11, 1987).On the other hand, the Supreme Court stated in the benzene decision aboutmedical surveillance that, ``It should also be noted that, in setting apermissible exposure level in reliance on less-than-perfect methods, OSHAwould have the benefit of a backstop in the form of monitoring the medicaltesting.Thus, if OSHA properly determined that the permissible exposure limit shouldbe set at 5 ppm, it could still require monitoring and medical testingfor employees exposed to lower levels. By doing so, it could keep a constantcheck on the validity of the assumptions made in developing the permissibleexposure limit, giving it a sound evidentiary basis for decreasing thelimit if it was initially set too high. Moreover, in this way it couldensure that workers who were unusually susceptible to benzene could beremoved from exposure before they had suffered any permanent damage.* * * This is precisely the type of information-gathering function thatCongress had in mind when in enacted section (6)(b)(7), which empowersthe Secretary to require medical examinations to be furnished to employeesexposed to certain hazards and potential hazards in order to most effectivelydetermine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected bysuch exposure. See Legis. Hist., p. 147 (Emphasis added)'' (448 U.S. 658).<T3>Accord, National Cottonseed Prods. Assoc. </T3>v. <T3>Brock,</T3> 829 F. 2d 482 (D.C. Cir. 1987), Cert. denied 56 U.S.L.W.3733 (4/26/88).OSHA is not raising the issue of the appropriateness of ancillary provisionsin this rulemaking for reasons discussed above. However, this questionmay be of relevance to any comments on the issue of insignificant riskand regulatory discretion.D. Basis for Identifying Replacement PEL'sOSHA's PEL's were based originally on established Federal standards andconsensus standards, as provided by the Occupational Safety and HealthAct. Those standards, in turn, were based largely upon air contaminantstandards (Threshold Limit Values or TLV's) promulgated by the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Originally, ACGIH-TLV'swere adopted for employees of government contractors, pursuant to the Walsh-HealeyAct. At the time, they represented the most comprehensive set of workplaceexposure guidelines available. They were then adopted under the OSHActas established federal standards.ACGIH updates its TLV's annually, adjusting exposure limits and addingnew substances to its list as evidence of health effects is accumulated.During the past 20 years, a gap has developed between the OSHA PEL's andthe more current ACGIH-TLV's because OSHA has approached standards-settingon an item-by-item basis and has not re-evaluated the PEL's listed in the1910.1000 Z Tables as a group.In the present rulemaking, OSHA had many more sources of standards fromwhich to consider exposure limits, and a comparison of several of thesesources was made early in the review process. In the review it became clearthat two sorts of decisions, based on alternative sources of standards,would be made. First, it was necessary to determine which substances wouldbe included in the updating, since the health effects of many more substancesare now known. Second, it was necessary to propose new limits for eachsubstance which will provide protection to exposed workers.OSHA examined lists of recommended exposure limits compiled by a varietyof professional organizations, international bodies, governments and governmentagencies, using these criteria:1. Comprehensiveness: What is the breadth (number of substances covered)and depth (inclusion of STEL's and ceilings as well as 8-hour TWA's) ofthe guidelines as a whole?2. Currentness: How recent are the limits and how often are they updated?3. Review Process: What procedures does he limit-setting body use to updateits list?4. Feasibility: To what extent is feasibility considered when limits aredecided upon?5. Documentation: What reasons are provided when limits are set and howwell-documented are those decisions?6. Applicability: Are the limits suitable for application in U.S. workplaces?OSHA considered exposure limits set by professional organizations. (TheAmerican National Standards Institute, ANSI; The American Industrial HygieneAssociation, AIHA; The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists,ACGIH), by NIOSH, by several countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, FederalRepublic of Germany, and Japan), and three international bodies (EuropeanEconomic Community, EEC; International Labor Organization, ILO; and theWorld Health Organization, WHO).Not all of these limits could be evaluated against all of the criteria,since information was unavailable in some cases. Some organizations donot explain their reasons for setting guidelines, and others do not publishdescriptions of their limit-setting and review procedures. OSHA nonethelessidentified a group of exposure limit lists that warranted additional study,including the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (REL's), WHO limits, Britishand West German limits and the TLV's established by ACGIH.For the purpose of determining which substance would be included in therulemaking, OSHA determined that the 1987-88 ACGIH-TLV list was most suitable.This TLV list included all of the substances in the present Z-tables, plussome two hundred more recently enrolled common substances. None of theother lists had equal depth and breadth. The number of hazardous substancesincluded in other lists ranged from three (the EEC) to about 400 (UnitedKingdom), compared to over 600 substances in the ACGIH list. The NIOSHREL's covered a total of approximately 160 substances with numerical values.OSHA then began its analysis of the particular exposure limits on the ACGIHlist, comparing them with values suggested by other sources. All of thesources cited above indicated the need for updating, but inconsistenciesin documentation of the recommended limits reduced the utility of mostsources. For example, while the United Kingdom has many recommended limits,documentation by means of specific studies and description of methodologyis often missing or inadequate for OSHA's purposes. In many instances,West German limits were based on the same 1968 documentation used by OSHA.Although West Germany has amended more than one hundred of the standards,documentation of feasibility and of risk has not been available to supportthe limits. OSHA believes that such documentation of feasibility wouldbe especially necessary if German standards were to be adopted for applicationin U.S. workplaces, given the differing social, economic and politicalenvironments in the two countries.NIOSH's recommended exposure limits (REL's) are well-documented and theyare set with U.S. workplaces in mind. NIOSH explains the basis for itslimits in criteria documents or in Current Intelligence Bulletins. OSHAhas considered each of the available REL's in preparing this proposal,and has used the NIOSH-recommended exposure limit wherever it is shownto be both feasible and more appropriate than the corresponding ACGIH TLV.In each instance where there is a ``significant difference'' between aTLV and REL for an individual substance, OSHA has independently evaluatedwhich value should be adopted as the PEL. In those few instances whereREL's indicated limits for substances which were not on the ACGIH list,no new limit was proposed, because it was necessary to set a boundary onthe number of substances to be evaluated. It was considered a higher priorityto devote time to completing the regulation of 428 substances, rather thanattempting to determine if additional substances, in other listings, shouldbe considered. Where the REL and TLV differed in matters such as minorvariations in TWA, lack of a STEL or ceiling, or use of a ceiling in lieuof a STEL, simplified procedures (described elsewhere) were adopted. Theseprocedures considered the availability of feasibility data, practical samplingconsiderations, and the time available to complete this rulemaking. Thecriteria for defining significant differences between REL's and TLV's isdiscussed in section I-F.Thus, the proposed modifications of OSHA's permissible exposure limitsare based on the best information available to the agency at this time,regarding both health effects and feasibility, making use of the guidelinesand recommendations developed by other organizations, primarily those ofNIOSH and ACGIH. OSHA requests that the public provide any further relevantinformation regarding both health effects and feasibility which will supplementthe information upon which this proposal is based.E. Substances Included in the Update of andSection;1910.1000 Z TablesTable I-E lists those 420 substances which are addressed by this proposal.This includes substances listed by the ACGIH in its publication ``ThresholdLimit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1987-88'', excluding:(a) 24 substances for which comprehensive OSHA standards exist; (b) 9 substancesfor which OSHA standard development is in active progress; (c) and 160substances from the existing Z-Tables where there is no difference betweenthe OSHA PEL and the adopted 1987-88 ACGIH-TLV. This rulemaking thereforeincludes all substances which have been changed or added to the ACGIH TLVlist since 1968. Changes or additions are considered to exist when: (1)A TWA or STEL has been modified; (2) a STEL or ceiling has been added (wherenone existed before); (3) where skin notation has been added; or (4) wheresome type of exposure limit (TWA, STEL or ceiling) exists where no OSHAlimit existed in the andSection;1910.1000 Z-Tables.Use of the TLV list as a reference point to define the bounds of this rulemakingis necessary to limit the number of substances under consideration to manageablesize. Since the TLV list is the most extensive available source, and isthe basis for the existing OSHA PEL's in the andSection;1910.1000 Z-Tables,it represents the best choice to serve this limited purpose.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 009</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 45-61 (2 to a page)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>F. Identification of Substances Requiring Special AttentionAs previously noted, the substances to be considered in this proposed rulemakingare defined by the aodpted 1987-88 ACGIH TLV's. The use of some boundaryfor this rulemaking is necessary to avoid the impossible task of consideringover 100,000 chemicals which exist in U.S. workplaces. Use of a singlesource to identify such a boundary is necessary to provide a clearly definedreference point for additional analyses. Since the 1968 ACGIH TLV's wereused (through the Walsh-Healey Act) as the primary basis for the existingZ-Tables adopted in 1971, and since the 1987-88 TLV's represent the mostextensive data base available (as described in a previous section of thepreamble), selection of the TLV's to satisfy the objective of setting aboundary, is appropriate.While the adopted 1987-88 ACGIH TLV's define the boundaries for this proposedrulemaking, the OSHA analysis (previously described) will consider boththe 1987-88 ACGIH TLV's and NIOSH REL's as the potential alternatives forselecting replacements for the existing OSHA PEL's noted in the andSection;1910.1000Z-Tables, or expansion of these Z-Tables.Twenty or more years have elapsed since the TLV's forming the basis forOSHA's PEL values were set. During the interim, a great deal of knowledgehas been gained regarding the hazards of these and other substances generallyfound in the workplace. Control technologies have evolved during this sametime, altering previous standards of feasibility for workplace exposures.OSHA realizes that while this proposal represents a major improvement inhealth protection, it is also necessary that OSHA evaluate the appropriatenessof the individual TLV's or REL's OSHA should also identify any individualsubstances which will require: (1) Special attention as part of this rulemaking,or (2) follow-up rulemaking activities.Of the 428 substances considered in this proposed rulemaking, approximately75 involved changes to the existing OSHA TWA; approximately 70 involvethe addition of, or changes to, a STEL in conjunction with an existingPEL; approximately 25 involve changes to both the TWA and STEL; and 205involve establishment of some allowable exposure limit where none existedbefore. These four categories cover most of the 428 substances to be coveredby this proposal.In most instances, proposed new PELs establish lower permissible exposurelimits or establish exposure limits where none existed before. In a verylimited number of instances, however, the permissible exposure limits couldbe increased in keeping with the best current judgment regarding toxicity,hazard, and risk for the specific substance in question. In those instances,OSHA will ascertain that the legal requirements for increasing an establishedPEL are satisfied. The details of this requirement are noted in that partof section IV of this preamble dealing with substances falling within thiscategory.Since two independent sources will be used to develop new PEL's it is necessaryto indicate what criteria will be used to identify substances where theTLV and REL ``differ significantly.'' These substances will undergo additionalanalyses to resolve the different recommendations. For this rulemakinga ``significant difference'' is presumed <T3>NOT </T3>to exist when:(a) The TLV and REL values are the same.(b) TLV and REL values differ by less than 10%.(c) The TLV and REL Time Weighted Averages (TWA) are the same, but thereare differences in the Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL) or Ceiling (C).(d) The TWA in one data base is the same, or one-half, the STEL/C in theother data base.OSHA realizes that (c) and (d) represent simplification of the standardsetting analysis. For both (b) and (c) situations, the TLV values willbe used since they represent a logical extension of the existing Z-Tables,which are based on the 1968 TLV's. This approach is intended to facilitatethe proposed changes for a large number of substances. Evidence may beintroduced into the record which will permit further analysis of thesesituations. OSHA will consider comments on this procedure prior to finalrulemaking. Based on comments, priorities and administrative resources,OSHA will consider if proposing further refinements in the future is appropriate.For situation (d), the data base providing a TWA value will be used, sincethis type of limit represents a more typical exposure monitoring situation.This will result in the adoption of PEL's based either on a TLV or REL.On the basis of these criteria, Table I-F-A lists 35 substances where thereis a ``significant difference'' between the TLV and the REL, and the RELis lower than the TLV. Table I-F-B lists 9 substances for which there isa ``significant difference'', and the REL is higher than the TLV. Individualevaluations will be performed by OSHA for each of the substances listedin these Tables.The approach of using primarily exposure limits from two well-establishedsets of guidelines carries with it the responsibility for OSHA to determinealso which of these limits is appropriate in light of the statutory andlegal requirements that OSHA must satisfy. OSHA describes in the followingtext these circumstances where consideration of other factors may be appropriate.OSHA requests comments on these proposed circumstances and/or the alternateprocedures for handling these situations (described in section I-G).To satisfy these requirements, and complete the objectives of revisionand expansion for a large number of exposure limits in a reasonable timeperiod, OSHA will identify two special situations by comparing the ACGIHTLV's with exposure limit guidelines developed by: (1) United Kingdom 1987Occupational Exposure Limits (OEL); (2) West German_1985 Maximum AllowableConcentrations (MAK); (3) Japanese Permissible Exposure Limits_1983; (4)Swedish-Allowable Workplace Air Concentrations_1984. OSHA will considerthe significance of differences among these sources, and take appropriateaction in each case. Use of the TLV's as a reference point for this comparisonis dictated by the fact that the TLV's define the boundary for the substancesto be considered in this proposed rulemaking, and any significant differencesbetween the TLV's and REL's are considered in the evaluation previouslynoted for substances listed in Tables I-F-A and I-F-B.OSHA proposes to identify these two special situations as follows:(a) At least three of the four alternate data bases recommend allowableexposure limits that are less than the 1987-88 ACGIH-TVL's. Five substancesfall into this category, and are identified in Table I-F-C. This criterionavoids undue consideration of any single low proposed exposure limit, andidentifies those instances where there is reasonable uncertainty regardingthe proper levels which will improve worker protection. One of these substancesnoted in Table I-F-C is also identified in Table I-F-B.(b) At least three of the four alternate data bases recommend allowableexposure limits which are <T3>greater</T3> than the 1987-88 ACGIH-TLV's. Ten substances fall intothis category, and these are identified in Table I-F-D. Two of the substancesnoted in Table I-F-D are also noted in Table I-F-B, and four of these substancesare listed in Table I-F-A.Special situations are also indicated for the following three circumstances:(c) The 1987-88 TLV exceeds the existing PEL. When considering these substances,OSHA will ascertain that the legal requirements detailed in the cottondust preamble (50 FR 511 32-3, Dec. 13, 1985) for increasing or eliminatingan existing PEL are satisfied. Analyses of these situations are detailedin that part of section IV which discusses substances for which currentACGIH TLV's are less stringent than current OSHA limits.(d) The available analytical and sampling methods are not adequate to measurethe air concentrations of a specific chemical. OSHA has reviewed this concernand has identified 7 substances for which adequate sampling and analyticalmethods are not available. These are listed in Table I-F-E and detailsregarding analytical procedures are provided in Appendix A. OSHA will considerif rulemaking can proceed for such substances, with final implementationbeing deferred until OSHA or others develop the necessary sampling andanalytical procedures.(e) Substances for which recent information suggests that the 1987-88 TLVsor REL's may not be appropriate. OSHA will consider this aspect prior tofinal rulemaking if the hearing record provides relevant additional information.This category may include substances such as carcinogens, which have implicitor explicit recommendations to maintain exposures to levels which are:As low as feasible; as low as detectable; minimal; as low as practical;etc. Clearly, the use of detection limits as a PEL does not fully considerthe feasibility issue. OSHA preliminarily believes that such substancescannot be considered in this rulemaking without greatly extending the decisionprocess, and inordinately delaying changing the PEL's for 428 substances.Therefore, it would be more appropriate to proceed only on the basis ofavailable, quantitative information provided by the TLV's or REL's. OSHAintends future consideration, using individual rulemaking, for such substances.OSHA invites public comments on the five special situations identified.OSHA also is interested in learning of any chemicals which should be addedto, or deleted from the listing in Tables I-F-A through I-F-E. Such suggestionsshould clearly indicate the basis and supporting data for any requestedchanges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Table I-F-A</ITAG>Significant Difference between REL and TLV REL lower than TLV<ITAG tagnum="15"> 1.

Alternate Procedures for Dealing withSubstances Requiring Special AttentionIn previous sections of this preamble, OSHA has indicated an approach wheredifferent recommendations exist for an individual TLV or REL. For thesesubstances an extended analysis of the health and feasibility data wasperformed to determine which level will be proposed. Evaluation of feasibilityand significance of risk are statutory requirements which OSHA must follow.The absence of any evidence indicating these requirements are satisfiedwould preclude OSHA from adopting a PEL. Therefore, permissible exposurelevels cannot be adopted if they are primarily based on limits of detection,or similar concepts, unless OSHA's legal requirements are satisfied.OSHA is also considering three possible alternative procedures for thesubstances categorized according to the criteria previously described,as requiring special attention (Tables I-F-C, and I-F-D). Any additionalsubstances which may be identified during the rulemaking process as requiringspecial attention may receive similar treatment.The first alternative would be to review in depth all the available healtheffects data for each of these substances, the data and reasoning whichlead to the different allowable exposure limits, the criteria of the organizationproviding each recommendation, relative dates of adoption, and the applicabilityof supporting data to typical workplaces in the United States. Based onthis analysis, OSHA could adopt either the REL, TLV or some other recommendedor other allowable exposure limit. This would require preparation of numerousmini-standards, a major time commitment by OSHA, and would probably resultin a significant delay in the adoption of 428 new or revised permissibleexposure limits proposed in this rulemaking.A second approach would be to identify the substances noted in SectionI-F-, Tables C, and D, (plus any additional substances identified duringthe rulemaking process) as requiring possible individual follow-up evaluationand possible separate rulemaking but adopt the proposed PEL or anotherlevel if clear evidence is presented to the record. This approach would:permit prompt updating and expansion of all the PEL's noted in the Z-Tableson the basis of either the TLV or REL; use the current rulemaking analysesto identify chemicals requiring priority consideration regarding theirPEL; and reduce conflicts among the several allowable exposure guidelineswhich currently face many industrial health protection organizations. Futurerulemaking based on OSHA priorities could consider the necessary and appropriaterefinements based on all the available evidence.A third approach would be to maintain the current OSHA PEL's for the substancesnoted in Section I-F, Tables C, and D (plus any additional substances identifiedduring the rulemaking process), while revising the remaining substanceson the basis of TLV or REL guidance. These unchanged substances would thenbe identified for future follow-up evaluations and possible separate rulemakingunder 6(b) provisions. This is similar to the second approach but withoutbenefit of the updating process.OSHA invites comments on these three options and others, so they can beconsidered in the final rulemaking. OSHA initially believes that the secondapproach is the best option since it promptly provides health protectionfor over 400 substances of concern, when the evidence indicates it is needed.The substances identified in Table I-F-E, where OSHA is not aware of anadequate analytical method, present a different situation. OSHA is consideringissuing the proposed new PEL's if supported by the record on health andfeasibility grounds. OSHA would also consider staying these PEL's untilan analytical procedure becomes available. OSHA requests comments on this,or alternate approaches.H. Construction, Maritime and Agriculture SegmentsCurrently the exposure limits which apply to construction are the ACGIHThreshold Limit Values of Air Contaminants for 1970 and certain substancespecific section 6(b) standards. See 29 CFR 1926.55, 58 and 29 CFR 1910.19.OSHA is to consult with the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety andHealth prior to proposing new standards that have a major impact on construction.See 29 CFR 1911.10(a). OSHA is in the process of consulting with the ConstructionAdvisory Committee. After receiving their recommendations, OSHA intendsto propose amendments covering exposures to toxic substances in constructionreflecting the facts in this proposal and the views of the ConstructionAdvisory Committee.Parts 1916, 1917 and 1918 of 29 CFR cover, respectively, employment inshipyards, marine terminals and longshoring. Part 1916 for shipyards referencesthe 1970 TLV's of the ACGIH. See 29 CFR 1915.5 and 1915.12 (b)(3). Part1917 for marine terminals references the current Z-Tables. See 29 CFR 1917.2(p),and 1917.23. Part 1918 for longshoring refers to ``dangerous gaseous contaminantsnot immediately dangerous to life'' and ``heavy concentrations of dusts.''See 29 CFR 1918.93 (e) and (f). Certain substance specific section 6(b)standards also cover these industries. See 29 CFR 1910.19.OSHA, as part of the rulemaking covering construction, intends to considerapplying this proposal to the maritime sectors.Subpart Z of 29 CFR Part 1910, and the included Z-Tables specifically donot apply to Agriculture. See 29 CFR 1928.21(b). In addition, many of thechemicals which affect agriculture are pesticides regulated by the EPAover which OSHA may not have jurisdiction, pursuant to section 4(b)(1)of the OSHA Act. In the future OSHA will consider based on relevance, prioritiesand administrative resources if it is appropriate to consider coveragefor agriculture.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Pertinent Legal Authority</ITAG>The publication of a final standard is authorized by sections 6 and 8 ofthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655and 657. Section 6(b)(5) governs the issuance of occupational safety andhealth standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents.It states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materialsor harmful physical agents under this subsection shall set the standardwhich most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis ofthe best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairmentof health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposureto the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his workinglife. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based uponresearch, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as maybe appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree ofhealth and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shallbe the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility ofstandards, and experience gained under this and other health and safetylaws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressedin terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.</ITAG>Section 3 (8) defines an occupational safety and health standard as ``astandard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or morepractices, means, methods, operations or processes, reasonably necessaryor appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.''The Supreme Court has held under the Act that the Secretary, before issuingany new standard, must determine that it is reasonably necessary and appropriateto remedy a significant risk of material health impairment. <T3>Industrial Union Department </T3>v. <T3>American Petroleum Institute, </T3>448 U.S. 607 (1980). The Court statedthat ``* * * before he can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard,the Secretary is required to make a threshold finding that a place of employmentis unsafe in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminatedor lessened by a change in practices'' (448 U.S. at 642). The Court alsostated ``that the Act does limit the Secretary's power to require the eliminationof significant risk'' (448 U.S. 644, n. 19). The Court indicated, however, that the significant risk determination is``not a mathematical straitjacket,'' and that ``OSHA is not required tosupport its finding that a significant risk exists with anything approachingscientific certainty.'' The Court ruled that ``a reviewing court [is] togive OSHA some leeway where its findings must be made on the frontiersof scientific knowledge (and that) * * * the Agency is free to use conservativeassumptions in interpreting the data with respect to carcinogens, riskingerror on the side of over protection rather than under protection'' (448U.S. at 655, 655). The Court also stated that ``while the Agency must support its findingthat a certain level of risk exists with substantial evidence, we recognizethat its determination that a particular level of risk is `significant'will be based largely on policy considerations.'' (488 U.S. at 655, n.62). After OSHA determines that a significant risk exists and that such riskcan be reduced or eliminated by the proposed standard, it must set a standardwhich is technologically and economically feasible. In <T3>American Textile Manufacturers Institute </T3>v. <T3>Donovan, </T3>452 U.S. 490 (1981) the Supreme Court held that ``cost-benefitanalysis is not required by statute because feasibility analysis is'' (452U.S. 531, n. 32). For non-threshold toxic substances, the aim is to setthe lowest feasible level necessary to eliminate significant risk. As stated above in the history and approach sections of the preamble, OSHAhas concluded that updating the Z-tables to reflect recent informationis the highest priority for the Agency. This will reduce exposure limitsfor approximately 200 substances regulated currently by the Z-tables andadd exposure limits for approximately 200 substances. The health; literatureindicates this must be accomplished to improve worker health: it is oneof Congress's concurrent goals and will greatly increase occupational healthprotection for a very large number of workers.In order to accomplish this high priority task in a reasonable time inthe light of limited administrative resources, it is necessary to narrowsomewhat the issues to be faced by the agency in this proceeding. Consequently,it is necessary to delay other worthwhile goals and concurrent Congressionalpurposes to a later stage.This approach is consistent with general principles of administrative law.An agency may set priorities within the framework of its statutory authority.Secondly, an Agency may take substantial steps towards its statutory goalswithout having to achieve them completely at the first stage, when agencyresources are not sufficient to complete all aspects initially. Section 6(g) of the OSHA Act clearly indicates that OSHA has authorityto set priorities among competing occupational health and safety goals.It states:<ITAG tagnum="21">In determining the priority for establishing standards under thissection, the Secretary shall give due regard to the urgency of the needfor mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries, trades,crafts occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments. The Secretaryshall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Secretary of Health,Education, and Welfare regarding the need for mandatory standards in determiningthe priority for establishing such standards.</ITAG>Several Court decisions recognize that OSHA has some discretion in settingpriorities. For example, the District of Columbia Circuit Court stated,<ITAG tagnum="21">The Act has built in flexibilities that the Secretary may use, suchas his right to initially determine whether or not there will be a standard;what the standard will be; the priorities between the various occupationsthat may require standards; the altering and changing of those prioritieseven though once set; the forgiving of inaction where the Secretary makesa contemporaneous statement of reasons; the right to delay hearings; toprocess higher priority standards more quickly than initiated ones  . .. Since the Congress left such open-ended discretion in the Secretary atmany key points in the Act, including Section 6(g) we find implicit acknowledgementthat traditional agency discretion to alter priorities and defer actiondue to legitimate statutory considerations was preserved. <T3>National Congress of Hispanic Cit. </T3>v. <T3>Usery </T3>554 F. 2d 1196, 1199-1200, (1977). See also <T3>National Cong. </T3>v., <T3>Marshall, </T3>626 F. 2d 882, 889 (1979).</ITAG>Similarly, the Court stated, in regard to delaying a relevant decisionto a later stage, in <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council </T3>v. <T3>S.E.C., </T3>606 F. 2d 1031 (1979) that,<ITAG tagnum="21">Deference to the SEC's decision to consider environmental disclosurein another proceeding is in our view, appropriate. Our discussion of thescope of review of agency rulemaking shows that the quasi-legislative natureof rulemaking requires even greater agency freedom to manage and structuredecisionmaking than is required in licensing or adjudication. (1056)</ITAG>It also stated.<ITAG tagnum="20">the Agency alone is cognizant of the many demands on its, its limitedresources, and the most effective structuring and timing of proceedingsto resolve those competing demands. An agency is allowed to be master ofits own house, lest effective agency decisionmaking not occur in any proceeding;and judicial review awaits the agency's conclusion of its proceedings.See Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U.LS. 41, 58 S.CT 459, 82L.ED.638 (1938). (p, 1056)</ITAG>Within this context the ACGIH's Threshold Limit Values and NIOSH RecommendedExposures Limits have been used in determining the substances to give priorityto in this proceeding. They have also been used as a starting point forOSHA's significant risk and feasibility analysis. See also the other criteriaused which are discussed in the ``History'' and ``Additional Factors''sections.  Secondly, OHSA has concluded that setting exposure limits for these chemicalshas priority at this stage over exploring the need for accompanying medicalsurveillance, monitoring and industrial hygiene provisions. Section 6(b)(7)of the Act, of course, indicates that ``where appropriate'' such provisionsare to be included. That was a concurrent goal of Congress as was Congress'goal to lower exposure for the many unregulated or inadequately regulatedsubstances when scientific data indicates lower exposures are needed. OSHA has inadequate time to accomplish both goals at this time. Loweringexposures is a higher priority because it is more effective in reducingdiseases and material impairments of health.  OSHA has already addressed some of section 6(b)(7)'s goals, labels andwarnings, in the Hazard Communication Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.1200 forall substances. It is working on a standard to improve respirator use forall chemicals (47 FR 20803). It is considering generic regulation for monitoringand medical surveillance. OSHA does not have the resources to concludethis rulemaking in any reasonable time, and also consider these issues. OSHA will meet its statutory requirements to determine whether the proposednew levels substantially reduce significant risk and are feasible. OSHA'srisk assessments are briefer than has been the case for rulemakings limitedto single sustances. Elaborate and detailed risk assessments for these428 substances which are generally recognized as needing new limits, wouldmake it impossible for OSHA to address these hazards in any reasonabletime period.  Many of the exposure limits are based on moderate safety factors belowlevels which human or animal studies report ``no observed effect'' (sometimescalled a ``threshold''). Incorporation of a moderate safety factor doesnot result in setting a limit below which significant risk is eliminated.Many of the studies are of small scale and do not have the scientific quality(statistical power) to demonstrate that a ``no observed effect level''has been shown. In many instances interpretation of health effects studiesmust account for inter-species and intra-species variability, and the lackof statistical power.Finally, when the reported no-effect level is based on animal date, considerationmust be given to the fact that humans may be more or less sensitive thanthe animals. All experts in this situation recommend setting an exposurelimit which includes a safety factor from the reported no observed effectlevel in animals. Therefore, a moderate safety factor below the level whichis hypothesized, or reported as demonstrating no observed effect, doesnot put OSHA in the position of proposing a limit below the level wherethere is insignificant risk.  In this rulemaking, OSHA is also proposing new exposure limits for somepossible carcinogens and some other chemicals for which there may be aremaining significant risk. It is possible that much more detailed analysisor new data might find that a lower limit than OSHA proposed would bothreduce remaining significant risk and be feasible.  However, OSHA preliminarily believes that to address those questions inthis rulemaking would significantly delay completion of this rulemakingwhich substantially improves health protection for many millions of workers.OSHA's experience in ethylene oxide, benzene, formaldehyde, asbestos andother such substances, indicates that these issues take a large amountof administrative and scientific resources for each substance. Consequently,OSHA preliminarily concludes that it is appropriate to complete this actionas first priority. In the future, based on priorities, OSHA will explorethe issue that for some substances lower limits might be determined tobe appropriate after more extensive analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Substances to be Regulated  </ITAG><T3>A. General Principles of Toxicology and Dose-Response  </T3>As long ago as the 16th century, people recognized that there is no suchthing as an absolutely safe chemical. The Swiss physician Paracelsus, wholive from 1493 to 1541, said: <ITAG tagnum="21">All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison. Theright dose differentiates a poison and a remedy. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">On the other hand, methods have been devised to permit any chemical,no matter how poisonous, to be handled safely; this is done either by limitingthe dose or controlling the exposure. However, before the necessary degreeof control can be determined for a particular exposure or situation, thetoxicity of the substance in question must be known. The paragraphs thatfollow describe the methods used by scientists to measure the relativetoxicity of substances and to select exposure limits that will preventexposed individuals from suffering adverse effects from such exposures.As this discussion demonstrates, methods of choosing exposure limits must,because of the lack or inadequacy of dose-response information for mostchemicals, rely heavily on experience in the use of these substances andon scientific and professional judgment.\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The material in this section derives principally from thefollowing sources: Klaasen, Amdur, and Doull, 1986; National Research Council,1986; and Cohen, 1986a, b.  Chemicals range in inherent toxicity from those that are relatively harmlesseven after large doses have been administered to others that cause deathif encountered even in small quantities. Toxicologists rank chemicals bycategories that range from practically non-toxic (an adult human wouldhave to consume a quart) to supertoxic (fewer than 7 drops would be lethalfor most people).  In the occupational setting, it is the risk associated with a particularuse of a chemical rather than its inherent toxicity that is important.<T3>Risk </T3>can be defined as the probability that a substance will produceharm under certain conditions of use. The converse of risk is <T3>safety, </T3>which is the probability that no harm will occur underspecific circumstances.  The degree of hazard associated with exposure to a specific substance dependson the manner in which it is handled in a particular situation: A supertoxicchemical that is processed in a closed, isolated system may be less hazardousin actual use than a relatively low-toxicity compound handled in an openbatch process. Another factor affecting the ability of a chemical to elicita toxic response is the susceptibility of the biological system or individual.For the relative degree of hazard to be known in a particular instance,this requires knowledge about the chemical agent, the exposure situation,and the exposed subject. In addition, the route of administration and theduration and frequency of exposure must be known.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Route of Exposure  </ITAG>There are four principal routes of exposure by which toxic substances caninvade humans or animals. These are inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption,and parenteral administration (i.e., administration through routes otherthan the intestinal canal). The route of administration of a toxin alsoaffects the relative toxicity of the agent. For example, a chemical thatcan be detoxified in the liver will be less toxic if it is administeredorally than if it is given systemically (i.e., inhaled). Studies that provideinformation about the relative toxicity of an agent via different routesof exposure can provide a considerable amount of information about theabsorbability of the agent. For example, if exposure to a certain doseof a chemical via all routes of administration causes death within thesame time period, it can be assumed that the substance in question is easilyand rapidly absorbed. On the other hand, if the dermal dose of a chemicalthat is required to kill a subject is much higher than the dose requiredto produce the same effect when the chemical is ingested, one can deducethat the skin provides, to some degree, a barrier against that agent'stoxicity. Other, less important elements affecting the response to a toxicsubstance include the relative concentration of the substance, the volumeof the vehicle used to administer the chemical, the chemical and physicalproperties of the vehicle, and the dose rate, i.e., the period of timeover which the dose is administered.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Duration and Frequency of Exposure  </ITAG>Scientists conduct animal experiments that involve four different typesof exposure: acute, subacute, chronic, and subchronic. Acute exposuresare limited to periods of less than 24 hours and can involve either singleor repeated exposures within that period. Subacute exposures are repeatedexposures that last for one month or less, while sub-chronic exposureshave a duration of one to three months. When a research project havinga chronic regimen is conducted, the test animals are dosed repeatedly fora period lasting more than three months. Animals exposed acutely can haveboth immediate and delayed-onset responses. Similarly, chronic exposurescan cause immediate reactions as well as long-term effects.The frequency of dosing also has an important influence on the magnitudeof the toxic effect: A large single dose of an acute toxin will usuallyhave more than three times the effect of one-third the dose given at threedifferent times, and the same dose administered in 10 or 15 applicationsmight have no effect whatsoever. The pattern of dosing is important becauseit is possible for some of the substance to be excreted between successiveadministrations or because the lesion caused by the toxin has a chanceto be partially or completely repaired between applications. Thus a chroniceffect is said to occur: (1) If a toxic substance accumulates in the systemof an exposed person or animal because the dose absorbed is greater thanthe body's ability to transform or eliminate the substance; (2) if it producesadverse effects that are not reversible; or (3) if it is administered ina manner that permits inadequate time for repair or recovery.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Variation in Response  </ITAG>Responses to toxic insults vary in a number of ways. For example, sometoxicants have immediate effects, while other are associated with delayedsymptom onset. The latency period for carcinogenic agents may be as longas 40 years for some types of cancer, and even some acute agents, suchas some chemicals that have adverse ocular effects, may not cause overtsymptoms until hours after exposure.Another difference in type of response concerns the reversibility or irreversibilityof the effect. Reversibility depends on the site of action as well as themagnitude of the insult. That is, some tissues of the body, such as theliver, have considerable ability to regenerate; others, like the kidneyor central nervous system, do not.The site of action associated with toxic substances also varies widely.Local effects are those lesions caused at the site of first contact betweenthe agent and the organisms. Examples of localized effects are skin burnscaused by contact with a caustic substance and site-of-contact tumors thatdevelop at the locus of the injection of the carcinogen.In contrast to localized effects, systemic effects involve the absorptionand distribution of the toxic agent from the point of entry to a distantsite; the toxic response is manifested at this distant point. An exampleof a systemic poison is mercury, which produces its toxic effect on thecentral nervous system. Often, the site of deposition for a chemical isnot the organ system most affected by the toxin. For example, althoughlead is deposited and concentrated in the bone, it affects the centralnervous system. Any sites that are adversely affected by the toxic effectsof exposure to a substance, whether they are sites of contact or distalsites, are called the target organs of toxicity.In cases of systemic poisoning, the system most often affected is the centralnervous system (CNS); it is common for the CNS to be involved even whenanother target, such as the liver, is the primary target organ of toxicity.In descending order of frequency, the systems or organs most often involvedin cases of systemic poisoning are the central nervous system, the circulatorysystem, the blood and hematopoietic system, the visceral organs (liver,kidney, lung), and the skin.<ITAG tagnum="81">Dose-Response</ITAG>The relationship that associates the dose of a chemical with the effectsit causes is called the dose-response relationship. A single data pointrelating a dose to a response is sufficient to establish a dose-responserelationship. As additional data become available, it is possible to expandour understanding of the dose-response relationship to cover a range ofdoses or exposures. Dose-response is the most important single principlein toxicology, and an understanding of dose-response is important in establishingoccupational or other exposure limits. Knowing how toxic substances actmakes it easier to predict the potential effects of exposure. (It is, ofcourse, generally true that lowering dose reduces response, and data areoften available to demonstrate that lower doses reduce responses, at leaston the grossly observable level. However, data showing that more subtleresponses, e.g., those at the subcellular level, have been reduced arerarely available.)To apply dose-response relationships, it is helpful if several types ofdata are available. First, it must be possible to relate a response toa particular chemical. Although basic data pointing toward causality maybe available, it is often difficult to refine the dose-response relationshipfurther. For example, epidemiological studies often identify an associationbetween a disease and one or more causative agents. However, since informationon the precise identity of the etiologic agent, the actual dose received,and the true site of the response is usually not available, it is oftenimpossible to use data from epidemiological studies to establish a precisedose-response relation between a specific dose of a toxin and an effect.The second condition to be met before dose-response can be establishedis that is must be possible to relate the response to the dose. It is relativelyeasy to determine that a large dose causes an obvious response. Refiningthe relationship, however, involves three other requirements: (1) Thatthere be a receptor site; (2) that the response and the intensity of theresponse be related to the concentration of the toxin at the receptor site;and (3) that the concentration of the toxin at the site be related to thedose given.The third principle underlying the concept of dose-response is that therebe a quantifiable means of measuring the toxicity of a substance and aprecise method of expressing this measured toxicity. Although lethalityin test animals is often used to measure toxicity, the best form of measurementwould involve quantification of the sequence of molecular events occurringduring the toxic response. In the absence of such endpoints, other goodmethods are available. For example, it is common to measure an effect believedto be related to the substance in question. The level of activity of anenzyme in the blood is often used as a measure of effect, e.g., serum glutamic-oxaloacetictransaminase (SGOT) levels are used to measure liver damage. Many differentendpoints can be used to measure toxic effects, such as changes in muscletone, heart rate, blood pressure, electrical activity of the brain, motorfunctioning, and behavior.The most widely used endpoint, especially when a new substance is involved,is lethality in an animal test system. Lethality studies allow scientiststo make comparative assessments of a chemical's toxicity as it relatesto that of many other substances. Research of this type also permits thegathering of essential information on dose, duration, route of administration,site of action, and the target organ of toxicity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Form of the Response</ITAG>The classic form of dose-response is sigmoidal (Figure 1). This form characterizesthe relationship between the amount of a toxin administered and the degreeof response to that dose. The response is measured on the ordinate, andthe dose is represented on the abscissa.Dose-response can be thought of in two ways:andbullet; As exposure increases, the proportion of the population that manifeststhe response increases;andbullet; As exposure increases, the intensity of the response increases.A relatively flat dose-response curve means that a large change in doseis required before there is a significant change in response. A step curve,on the other hand, means that a small change in dose will elicit a largeincrease in response. Although it is sometimes possible to generate a curveof the type shown in Figure 1, it is not necessary to do so to demonstratethat exposure at a given level is associated with a particular response.That is, it is not necessary to have sufficient data to define, in mathematicalterms, the dose-response relationship to know that exposure at a givenlevel is associated with adverse consequences.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 100</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>In the regulatory context, it is most common to express dose-response relationsin terms of the percentage of the population responding. However, thisinformation alone is meaningless unless the endpoint being considered isknown. For every substance, there are several dose-response relationships,depending on endpoint: A substance that produces irritation at low dosesmay cause more severe symptoms or even death at high doses and in otherconditions. For example, many substances that are mucosal irritants atlow doses will produce pulmonary edema and nervous system effects at highdoses.Plotting the cumulative percentage of individuals responding against doseproduces the typical sigmoid curve. Such a curve reflects the fact thatat the lowest dose, zero percent of the population responds, while 100percent of the population will respond at the highest dose. However, ifthe percentage responding is plotted against incremental rather than totaldose, the curve produced is abnormal distribution (Figure 2). This curvesays that a relatively small percentage of the population will manifestthe response at the lowest dose and that a similarly small percentage ofthe population will exhibit the effect at the highest dose. What this normaldistribution of response reflects is individual and species variation inexposed populations. A wide degree of variation occurs even in inbred,homogeneous laboratory animals, and such variability increases dramaticallywhen a heterogeneous population, such as workers, is involved. Individualsresponding at the left end of the curve shown in Figure 2 are hypersusceptible,while those at the right end could be termed resistant.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Because the relationship between dose and response is sigmoidal, responseapproaches zero as dose approaches zero. However, because of the mathematicalform used to express this relationship, a true zero response can neverbe achieved. In the strictest sense, therefore, a true threshold dose level(i.e., the dose with which a zero response is associated) can never beestablished on the basis of experimental research. Instead, scientistsattempt to define the minimum dose associated with a specific endpoint,which is customarily termed the ``threshold'' dose for that particularendpoint. However, unless a specific endpoint, such as respiratory irritation,cholinesterase inhibition, the development of a tumor, or death, is specified,the concept of a threshold is essentially meaningless. In fact, a separatethreshold could be said to exist for each of these endpoints.The extent to which an experimentally derived ``threshold'' actually reflectsthe true threshold for a substance (i.e., the level above which a responsewill occur and below which no response will occur) depends on several factors,such as the number of animals used to determine the experimental threshold,the number of dose levels tested, and the degree of variation representedin the test subjects. For example, to determine an LD<T2>50</T2> (the lethal dose that will kill 50 percent of the animals tested)with a high degree of precision requires the use of a minimum of 50 testanimals and 5 dose groups (10 animals in each group). Other factors thatcan influence the magnitude of the median lethal dose include the sourcesinvolved, the sex and age of the animals, the environmental conditionsprevailing during the test conditions, diet, the health status of the subjectsbeing tested, and their past exposure to other toxic substances.In toxicological research, the experimentally observed ``threshold'' doseis called the low observed effect level (LOEL) or the low observed adverseeffect level (LOAEL). Alternatively, the threshold may be expressed asthe highest no observed effect level (NOEL), i.e., the highest dose administeredand found not to produce a given response. Determination of an accurateNOEL requires both a careful interpretation of the toxicological data andthe use of an adequate number of test animals. The National Academy ofSciences (1985) has concluded that the chance of finding a no adverse effectlevel (that is, of missing an adverse effect) at a given dose is statisticallygreater in experiments having a small number of animals than in studiesinvolving a large number of animals. Thus, the degree of confidence onehas that NOEL actually represents a ``safe'' dose, rather than a researchdesign artifact, increases with the number of animals tested. The greatestdegree of confidence is associated with studies involving a large numberof animals that were tested at several doses that were administered atclose intervals.<ITAG tagnum="81">Safety Factors</ITAG>Because of the uncertainties surrounding the use of NOELs and LOELs, thedifficulties of extrapolating from animals to humans, and the problemsinvolved in trying to account for biological variability (both across speciesand within the same species), regulators and others have used safety factorsto aid them in setting permissible exposure limits. Safety factors aremargins applied to the NOEL or LOEL to determine a level believed to be``safe.'' Safety margins are necessary because studies designed to establishNOELs and LOELs do not generally pick up other-than-gross-organ responsesor include hypersusceptible individuals. Regulatory agencies and limit-settingorganizations have traditionally used safety factors ranging from 2 to1,000.These factors are designed to account for:andbullet; Sensitive members of a population;andbullet; Extrapolation from animals to human; andandbullet; Administration of a substance via a different route.Additional safety factors may be applied if the toxicological endpointassessed by the NOEL or LOEL is an insensitive one, e.g., lethality. Thisis necessary because the dose that is ``safe'' for an insensitive endpointwill not really be safe in terms of any adverse effects occurring beforethat endpoint is reached. That is, the LOEL associated with convulsionscaused by a neuropathic agent will not be safe or protective against thedecrement in mental capacity observed in animals or people long beforeconvulsions occur; to give another example, a dose that is ``safe'' interms of lethality is often sufficient to cause serious damage to variousorgan systems.<ITAG tagnum="81">Types of Toxicological Evidence</ITAG>The evidence available to scientists wishing to evaluate the toxicity ofa substance can be derived from studies in laboratory animals, in-vitrostudies in cell or tissue systems, reports of clinical observations, studiesof exposed human populations, or from intervention studies conducted withhuman volunteers. The preceding paragraphs have described animal studies(or ``bioassays''). The following section discusses the two most commontypes of human evidence: Data derived from clinical observations and informationfrom epidemiological studies.<T3>Clinical observations.</T3> Much of the data on the toxic effects associatedwith human exposures have come from industrial accidents, fatal poisonings,or other such tragedies. This information is generally more useful in delineatingbroad categories of pathological effects than in refining a specific dose-responserelationship, because the exposure levels causing the accident are knownto be high but cannot be quantified with precision.<T3>Epidemiological studies.</T3> Studies conducted by epidemiologistsare designed to reveal the patterns of disease or mortality prevailingin certain groups of people (usually workers) exposed to a single toxinor to a group of substances. One of the advantages of epidemiological studiesis that they involve humans and their responses to actual situations. Theinterpretation of the results of epidemiological studies is complicatedby the inevitable presence of confounding variables that occur wheneverhuman populations are involved. Ideally, the populations being studies(i.e., the study population and the control population) should be fullycomparable with regard to every variable except the single characteristicunder study. Because it is rarely possible to achieve this degree of comparability,statistical techniques are often used to attempt to adjust for this lackof comparability. In addition, if the measured effect is relatively large,it is unlikely that confounding factors will obscure the true picture.Broadly speaking, epidemiological studies can have two possible outcomes:They can report an effect or they can report no effect; in the former case,the study is termed a positive study, and in the latter, a negative one.Within each of these categories, it is possible for the study to be correct(that is, to give a true-positive or true-negative result) or to be incorrect(that is, to give a false-positive or a false-negative result). A false-positiveresult reports that there is an increased risk when in fact there is not,and a false-negative study reports that there is no increased risk whenin fact there is.The probability that a study will detect a statistically significant effectif that effect is actually present is called the power of the study. Asthe power of a study increases, the likelihood of producing a false-negativeerror decreases. Power is dependent on two factors: The level of relativerisk being evaluated and the number of cases of the effect (i.e., disease)that are expected in the population being studied. The number of expectedcases depends both on the sample size and the expected disease frequencyin the comparison population. For example, a study involving a small populationand a common disease can have the same power as a study of a rare diseasein a large population. Consequently, studies of larger samples have sufficientpower to detect smaller increases in risk, and studies of smaller sampleswill be able only to detect large increases in relative risk.Because epidemiological studies have limitations, it is essential thatthe power of such studies, particularly of negative studies, be examinedto ensure that their sample sizes are adequate to detect the absence ofincreased risk with validity. When the power of a study is not adequate,negative studies cannot be said either to contradict or to support theconclusion that increased risk exists. However, a study with a positiveresult may indicate a relationship if the excess risk is high, even ifthe study's sample size is small and the effects of some factors are notcontrolled for.<ITAG tagnum="81">Quality of Evidence</ITAG>Dose-response models have often been used in the quantitative assessmentof the risks associated with exposures to carcinogenic substances. However,less scientific effort has been devoted to models to be used with non-carcinogenicsubstances. Mathematically precise methods to establish the true no-effectlevel or to define the dose-response curves have not been developed formost of the more than 400 substances involved in this rulemaking.Most of the scientific work that has been done was designed to identifylowest observed effect or no-effect levels for a variety of acute effects.As described above, experts in industrial hygiene and occupational healthhave developed factors to be used to offset, at least to some extent, theinsensitivity of NOELs and LOELs to such factors as subcellular effects,sensitive individuals, and chronic effects. It is possible to use thesedata, combined with professional judgment and OSHA's expertise and experience,to determine that significant risk exists at current levels of exposureand that a reduction in these levels will substantially reduce that risk.OSHA is also confident that it is not attempting in this rulemaking toreduce exposures to insignificant levels. However, additional analysismay well reveal that the levels being proposed at this interim stage canbe refined further in the future.B. Historical Development of Occupational Exposure Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">Early Limits</ITAG>Until the development of occupational health standards, the occurrenceof adverse health effects resulting from exposures to hazardous substancesor conditions in the workplace could only be determined <T3>ex post facto</T3>_after impairment had already occurred to the healthand welfare of exposed employees. In her 1910 studies of lead poisoning,Dr. Alice Hamilton was forced to rely on ``personal observations of workingconditions and the illness and deaths of workers to demonstrate the existenceof harmful exposures'' (Paull 1984). The concept of occupational exposurelimits thus represents a dramatic breakthrough in the battle against occupationaldisease and remains ``one of the most useful and indispensable tools yetdevised for safeguarding the health and well-being of industrial workers''(Thomas 1979).Occupational exposure limits are air quality values that apply in workplaces,and they are derived by studying the correlation between the amount ofa toxic substance absorbed by the body and its effects on health. Withinthe context of occupational exposure, knowledge of this relationship permitsquantification of the etiology ``of a large number of occupational healthimpairments, [evaluation of] the risk of such impairments and, if necessary,[consideration of] the effectiveness of preventive meaures'' (Parmeggiani1983). More specifically, an understanding of the levels at which diseaseor other health effects occur can be used to establish limits of occupationalexposure below which health hazards are unlikely to occur in most workers.The historical development of occupational exposure limits began with thepublished reports of a German scientist whose investigations in 1883 intothe effects of experimental animals (and on himself) of carbon monoxidein known air concentrations caused him to conclude that ``the boundaryof injurious action of carbon monoxide lies at a concentration in all probabilityof 500 parts per million, but certainly [not less than] 200 parts per million''(Cook 1987). Shortly after the appearance of this first documented dose-responsevalue, another German researcher, K. N. Lehmann, published a series ofreports on a number of chemical substances under the title ``ExperimentalStudies on the Effect of Technically and Hygienically Important Gases andVapors on the Organism.'' This series culminated in 1936 with a comprehensivepaper on chlorinated hydrocarbons, published as Volume 116 of <T3>Archiv fuer Hygiene.</T3>In 1912, Rudolf Kobert published a table of exposure limits, based on animalstudies, for 20 compounds. One of the first tables of hazardous air concentrationsto originate in the United States was a technical paper published in 1921by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The 33 substances included in this table werethose frequently encountered in the workplace. In addition to limits basedon acute toxic effects, this table provided some information on the leastdetectable odor concentration and the lowest airborne concentration requiredto cause irritation (Paull 1984; Cook 1987).Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, data became available that correlated concentrationsof harmful substances with observed effects on worker health for such materialsas lead and mercury compounds, benzene, and granite dusts. These earlyoccupational health studies, which were based on animal experiments andon findings in exposed workers, provided the kind of data needed to linkhuman exposures ``to concentrations that were capable of producing notonly acute, but chronic health effects'' (Paull 1984).After 1935, the emphasis of researchers had shifted, for the most part,from the reporting of a series of values for a range of acute effects toresults that yielded a single limit based on studies of repeated exposures.Over the years, a sizable amount of data about the levels of exposure thatwould not produce injurious effects had been amassed for a considerablenumber of substances. ``By the early 1940s, control of the occupationalenvironment to prevent the harmful absorption of toxic materials was becomingan accepted principle, and the practical problem of defining what was `harmful'was beginning to be met by employing maximum allowable concentrations''(Paull 1984). In 1943, Sterner explained the meaning of the term maximumallowable concentrations as ``the upper limit of concentration of an atmosphericcontaminant which will not cause injury to an individual exposed continuouslyduring his working day and for indefinite periods of time'' (Paull 1984).The first lists of maximum allowable concentrations of airborne toxic substanceswere issued between 1933 and 1938. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(U.S.S.R.) was the first country to make occupational exposure limits astatutory obligation; in 1933 it published a list that included 14 substances(although health standards for some air pollutants apparently were usedin the Soviet Union during the 1920s). The first American list was publishedfour years later by the State of Massachusetts, and in 1938 Germany issuedoccupational health standards for a number of organic solvents (Holmbergand Winell 1977). Additionally, the United States ``imposed limited occupationalsafety and health requirements on certain contractors with the Federalgovernment'' when the Walsh-Healey Act was passed in 1936 (Mintz 1984).<ITAG tagnum="81">Standards Developed by Professional Organizations</ITAG>During the 1940s, American organizations led in the development of occupationalhealth standards, beginning with the American Standards Association (nowthe American National Standards Institute, or ANSI) list of ``maximum acceptableconcentrations'' (MACs), which appeared in 1941. This list representeda consensus of opinion by the ASA and a number of industrial hygienistswho had formed the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists(ACGIH) in 1938 (Baetjer 1980). Originally conceived of as a time-weightedconcentration to be maintained as an average over the working shift, theMAC was redefined in 1957 to mean an upper level (ceiling level) that shouldnever be exceeded (Turner 1976).An important contribution to occupational health standard-setting was madein 1945 by Warren Cook, who published a list of maximum allowable concentrationsfor 132 industrial atmospheric contaminants. These limits had been developedby six states, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the American StandardsAssociation, and included Cook's own list of ``accepted or tentative values''based on industrial experience, animal experimentation, human sensory response,or a combination of these factors. This table was followed by:<ITAG tagnum="20">documentation supported by 187 specific references, indicating thebasis and reliability of each value. Cook was the first investigator tocodify all of the available data on MAC's and present it in one publication.His list of recommended values was incorporated, practically without changes,by the ACGIH in establishing the TLVs. In support of Cook's inferences,it should be noted that 50 of the * * * values that he recommended in 1945were subsequently adopted as federal standards, and are still in use today(Paull 1984).</ITAG>The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Subcommitteeon Threshold Limits presented its second report at the Eighth Annual Meetingof the ACGIH in 1946. The report included values for 131 gases, vapors,dusts, fumes, mists, and 13 mineral dusts ``compiled from the list reportedby this subcommittee * * * in 1942, from the list published by Warren Cookin * * * 1945, and from published values of the Z-37 Committee of the AmericanStandards Association'' (Cook 1987). The Committee's report noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Considerable difficulty attends the fixing of satisfactory valuesfor maximal allowable concentrations of chemicals in respirable atmospheresbecause of the lack of a uniform definition of the maximum allowable concentrationconcept. One concept is that the M.A.C. value should represent as accuratelyas possible that concentration at which a worker exposed for a sufficientperiod of time will just escape physiological or organic injury and occupationaldisease. A second concept is that the M.A.C. should represent some fractionof that concentration which will injure the worker in order to allow amargin of safety in the design of protective equipment and guard againstpossible synergistic effects in the case of multiple exposures. A thirdconcept is that the M.A.C. should perform the functions of the former conceptsand in addition provide a work environment free of objectionable but non-injuriousconcentrations of smokes, dusts, irritants and odors. Obviously all ofthese concepts cannot be fulfilled with the establishment of a single value.M.A.C. values in use at the present time represent examples of all of theseconcepts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The committee feels that the establishment of dual lists or a singledefinition is not possible at the present time.</ITAG>The report concluded by stressing that the 1946 list of M.A.C. values waspresented ``with the definite understanding that it be subject to annualrevision'' (Report of the Sub-committee on Threshold Limits 1946).Papers presented at both the Ninth International Congress on IndustrialMedicine in London (1948) and at the Fifteenth International Congress ofOccupational Health in Vienna (1966) also dealt with maximum acceptableconcentrations. The first of these proposed that zones of toxicity be setup to facilitate an understanding of the relative hazards of substances,``since the boundarties of MAC values were not sharp lines of demarcation''(Cook 1987). At the 1966 meeting, discussion took place on the advantagesof the concept of a ``peak level'' of exposure_an extension of the ``ceilinglevel'' notion inherent in the definition of a MAC since 1957. A ``peaklevel'' was defined as one ``that can be applied to certain substancesfor brief designated periods and for a strictly limited number of timesduring the work shift, with a designated time interval between peaks. The`peak' concept places a limit on the intermittent higher exposures thatoccur in many industrial operations. The time-weighted average exposurelimit is of course to be observed [even when a peak has also been assignedto a substance]'' (Cook, 1987).Terminology and definitions throughout this early period were ambiguousand imprecise, reflecting uncertainty as to exactly what needed to be andcould be done in the realm of occupational health standard setting. Initially,the ACGIH designated its recommended limits as ``maximum allowable concentrations,''although this term was often used interchangeably with ``threshold limitvalues.'' Confusion about the meaning, interpretation, and relative significanceof the terms being employed during this embryonic period was common. After1953, the ACGIH defined the concept of threshold limit values in the prefaceto its annual published list of occupational health standards as ``maximumaverage atmospheric concentrations * * * for an eight-hour day.'' Thisdefinition of the TLVs as average concentrations differed from the generalunderstanding of the original term ``maximum allowable concentrations,''which were essentially ceiling values (Stokinger 1962).By 1955, the ACGIH's philosophy of establishing threshold limits had begunto shift from concern solely with the prevention of acute stress and illnessto consideration also of ``more subtle effects on health, such as the effectsof annoying or irritating agents * * *. Thus, whereas a threshold limitvalue of 3 or 4 ppm for chlorine would insure no impairment to workers'health, this value is reduced to 1 ppm in the interest of greater freedomfrom irritant effects'' (Stokinger 1956). It should be noted that suchanalyses often did not take into account chronic effects or responses amongsensitive workers.Documentation for the 238 substances included in the TLV list for 1956was provided by Smyth in a separate paper in which the author<ITAG tagnum="20">recommended that the TLV's include references to the underlying data,and that the concepts represented by the values be restated in more realistictoxicological terms. In his analysis of the TLVs, he [Smyth] concludedthat nine categories of objectionable action were guarded against: chronictoxicity, acute toxicity, narcosis, irritation, asphyxiation, fume fever,eye pigmentation, allergic response, and cancer. (Paull 1984)</ITAG>At about the same time, Stokinger stated that in his opinion, the ThresholdLimits Committee had avoided grappling with the issue of developing a methodfor establishing limits for industrial carcinogens and noted that, withthe exception of nickel carbonyl, limits had not been assigned for potentialcarcinogens (Paull 1984). In 1962, however, the TLV Committee includedthree carcinogens as additions to the TLV list, although these were listedseparately in an appendix and did not have assigned TLVs.Despite the fact that the ACGIH had stressed early on that TLVs were intendedas guides and not as rigidly enforceable limits, the American StandardsAssociation's MAC values (or, where none was available, the TLV) were includedas mandatory limits in the Safety and Health Standards for Federal SupplyContracts, which were published in 1960 under the Walsh-Healey Act. Followingthis action, the ACGIH issued a statement on the definitions and interpretationsof TLVs and MACs (Stokinger 1962). At the same time, the ACGIH announcedthe production of the first edition of the <T3>Documentation for Threshold Limit Values </T3>(ACGIH 1962); this wasfollowed by another paper in which the work and intentions of the ThresholdLimits Committee were reviewed. Turner states that:<ITAG tagnum="20">[a]t this time the concept of ceiling values and excursion factorsaround the time-weighted average values was introduced in order to reduceconflict or confusion with the `maximal' values in the American [ANSI]Standards. A `C' (ceiling value) listing was to be given to those fast-actingsubstances thought likely to be injurious if the concentration exceededthe limit value by more than a designated factor for a relatively shortperiod (about 15 min.). The factor varied between 3 and 1.25, dependinginversely upon the magnitude of the TLV. A corollary was that the factorwould also indicate the limit of permissive excursion of the concentrationabove the TLV for a substance not given a `C' listing, always providedthat the time-weighted average concentration did not exceed the TLV. Thisrule of thumb approach to limiting exposure is no doubt appropriate tocertain substances when they are used routinely throughout the workingday. It seems to have little relevance in other instances where exposureis irregular or where the basis for fixing the TLV is on grounds otherthan toxicity. (Turner 1976)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Limits in the Era of OSHA</ITAG>The enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 markedthe first ``comprehensive and serious attempt * * * to protect the healthand safety of American workers'' (Mintz 1984); it also greatly extendedthe use of MACs and TLVs by authorizing the newly established OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) to adopt as its own standards ``nationalconsensus standards'' and established federal standards (29 U.S.C. 655(a)).Mintz notes that ``in addition to the safety standards adopted under section6(a), OSHA also adopted permissible exposure limits for approximately 400toxic substances. These [start-up] health standards, now appearing in 29CFR 1910.1000, * * * were derived from both national consensus and establishedfederal standards. The national consensus standards had been issued byANSI, while the established federal standards had been adopted under theWalsh-Healey Act from the TLVs * * * recommended by the * * * ACGIH'' (Mintz1984).Since OSHA's large-scale adoption of the ANSI consensus standards and the1968 ACGIH TLVs, the Agency has promulgated standards under section 6(b)of the OSH Act to regulate the industrial use of 24 substances, most ofwhich have been identified as occupational carcinogens, but the ANSI andACGIH start-up standards continue to comprise the major part of the Agency'soccupational health and safety program.In the interval since the establishment of OSHA and the adoption of theACGIH and ANSI limits by the Agency, the ACGIH has continued to revise,update, and document the recommended limits that appear in its annual listof TLVs. Since 1968, annual revisions have been made to these limits bythe ACGIH. During this time, the TLVs have been ``accepted on an internationalbasis as the best available guides for providing healthful occupationalenvironments, and at least 18 countries, including the United States, haveeither adopted them as legal standards or as guides to legal action, thusverifying their efficacy in accomplishing this purpose'' (Paull 1984).The action OSHA takes today initiates the process of updating the Agency'sZ table permissible exposure limits. That these limits are seriously outof date is attested to by the fact that the ACGIH has found it necessaryto revise or add nearly 200 limits to its list in the 20 years since thelimits that were later adopted by OSHA were initially published. Recognitionthat OSHA's Z table limits need updating to reflect recent developmentsin toxicology and new data on the health effects associated with exposureto these substances is widespread throughout industry: For example, OSHArequires and it is standard practice for organizations that develop MaterialSafety Data Sheets (MSDSs) to include on these MSDSs the ACGIH's currentTLV values, as well as the OSHA limit.The following section describes the methodology used by OSHA in selectingthe limits it is proposing today. The Agency believes that promulgationof these limits will address a broad range of significant risks now prevalentin industry. As many industrial hygienists and occupational safety andhealth professionals have noted, the use of permissible exposure limitscontinues to be the single most efficacious way of protecting the health,functional capacity, and well-being of the American worker.C. Description of the Substances For Which Limits Are Being ProposedIn this rulemaking, OSHA considered revising 428 substances and is proposingto revise existing or add new limits for several hundred (a total of 406)toxic substances currently being manufactured, used, or handled in workplacesthroughout general industry. This section of the preamble identifies theproposed PELs, describes the available toxicological data for many of thesesubstances, and explains the Agency's rationale for selecting the proposedlimits for several of these substances.The universe of substances included in this rulemaking is bounded by thesubstances for which the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) has established a Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for exposuresin the work environment. That is, OSHA is not proposing at this time toestablish exposure limits for any hazardous substance that is not includedin the ACGIH's 1987-88 List of TLVs. In addition, where the limit includedin the current ACGIH list is identical to OSHA's existing Z-table limitfor the same substance, OSHA is not proposing a change. OSHA has determinedthat the ACGIH's TLV is clearly the most comprehensive list for this purpose.Although limits are not being proposed for chemicals excluded from theACGIH's 1987-88 list, OSHA has not limited its consideration of appropriatelimits to those levels established by the ACGIH. The Agency has also carefullyevaluated the exposure limits recommended by the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health, OSHA's sister agency. In instances whereboth NIOSH and the ACGIH have recommended substantially different limitsfor the same substance, OSHA has thoroughly analyzed the evidence presentedby each organization before determining which of the two limits to propose.The proposed limits thus represent, in the Agency's professional judgment,those levels found to be most consistent with OSHA's mandate and the caselaw that has subsequently developed to interpret that mandate. (For a discussionof the relevent legislative and judicial principles, see the section elsewherein this preamble entitled History and Need for Revision of the PELs.For ease of analysis and presentation, the substances included in the scopeof this rulemaking have been grouped into 18 separate sub-sections. Ingeneral, these groupings reflect the principal mechanisms of action ortarget organ systems involved in the toxic responses that occur when workersare exposed to these substances.In addition to target organs or effect groupings, separate sections dealingwith limits set on the basis of no-effect levels or by analogy are included.Three additional sections cover substances for which the ACGIH has increasedits limits, substances for which OSHA is proposing to add short-term limits,and those for which the Agency proposes to add skin notations.The following sections are included:1. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of NeuropathicEffects.2. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of NarcoticEffects.3. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of SensoryIrritation.4. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Liveror Kidney Effects.5. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of OcularEffects.6. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of RespiratoryEffects.7. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of CardiovascularEffects.8. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of SystemicEffects.9. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Observed No-EffectLevels. 10. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance of AdverseNuisance Effects.11.

Substances for Which OSHA Is Proposing Short-Term Exposure Limits.18. Substances for Which OSHA Is Proposing To Add Skin Notations.A list of the references that OSHA relied on in evaluating the toxicologicalevidence pertaining to these chemicals appears at the end of Section IV.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofNeuropathic Effects</ITAG>IntroductionMany industrial chemicals have been shown to cause severe neurologicaleffects in exposed workers, and in many cases these effects are irreversible.There are 20 chemicals for which limits have been set on the basis of avoidanceof neuropathic effects. Table C1-1 lists the current PEL, ACGIH TLV, NIOSHREL, CAS number, and OSHA identification number for each of these chemicals.The table shows time-weighted averages (TWAs), ceiling limits, and short-termexposure limits (STELs). For this group of 20 compounds, OSHA is proposingto lower its current TWA-PEL for two substances; add a STEL to an existingTWA for five substances; change an existing ceiling to a TWA and STEL forone substance; change an existing TWA-PEL to a ceiling value for one substance;amend existing short-term or ceiling limits for four substances; and establishnew exposure limits for seven substances not currently regulated by OSHA.As Table C1-1 shows, most of the proposed limits are revisions of existingOSHA limits, rather than new additions to Table Z. In only five instancesis there a difference between the quantitative limits set by the ACGIHand NIOSH for the same substance.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 122-124</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsThe human nervous system comprises the central nervous system (CNS) andperipheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS is made up of the brain and spinalcord, while the PNS consists of a network throughout the body of nervesthat communicate with the CNS via connections to the spinal cord. The brainand spinal cord are bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, which supplies nutrientsto the CNS and also acts as a barrier against some foreign substances.This barrier protects the central nervous system. In general, fat-solublesubstances readily diffuse across this barrier and water-soluble substancesdo not. Chemicals that affect the central nervous system may manifest their toxiceffects peripherally. An example of this is the tremor associated withelemental and organic mercury poisoning. Exposure to some chemicals, suchas n-hexane, is associated with axonal degeneration of the nerves in boththe central and peripheral nervous systems. Baker (1983) refers to thisdual-system effect as central-peripheral distal axonopathy.Nervous system toxicants can affect motor function, sensory function, orintegrative processes, and they can also cause changes in the behaviorof exposed persons. Substances that cause demyelination or neuronal damagecan produce motor dysfunction that is expressed as muscular weakness orunsteadiness of gait, while exposures to chemicals that are associatedwith loss of sensory function may result in alterations in touch, pain,or temperature sensation or damage to sight or hearing. Other neuropathicchemicals affect the way in which information is processed in the brainand can interfere with learning and memory.Although mature neurons cannot divide and be replaced, the nervous systemhas considerable ability to restore function lost as a result of exposureto toxic chemicals. This capability to restore function even after neuronshave been killed is achieved by two mechanisms: Plasticity of organizationand redundancy of function. That is, when some neurons die, other cellsthat perform the same function may be able to maintain an adequate levelof functioning, or other neurons may be able to ``learn'' how to performthe lost function. However, even when one of these mechanisms comes intoplay to compensate for neuronal damage, the overall reserve capacity ofthe nervous system will have been diminished. The loss of this reservecould be critical in a situation in which additional demands are placedon the nervous system. Thus, even so-called reversible neuropathic effectsshould be seen as toxic effects causing alterations in an impairment ofthe normal functioning of the nervous system.The neurological effects potentially associated with chemical exposuresare numerous, and it is not always easy to identify the precise targetsite. However, recent medical advances have made tests available that candetect neurological damage that was not detectable several years ago. Forexample, electrophysiological methods have been developed to measure damageto the visual pathway caused by such exposures. Because of the variationin individual responses to chemical exposures, exposure limits should beset with a view toward this range of susceptibility and the avoidance ofany neuropathic effects.Peripheral Nervous System EffectsThe pathological mechanisms associated with peripheral neuropathies resultfrom segmental demyelination or axonal degeneration. Segmental demyelinationdestroys the myelin sheath but leaves the axon intact; this causes a slowingin nerve conduction velocity. Muscle weakness is often the first sign ofsuch segmental demyelination, and this effect can progress to a declinein motor function or paralysis. Although remyelination may occur withinweeks after injury, even a temporary loss in motor or sensory functionplaces the affected worker or others at risk of injury.Axonal degeneration is a more serious effect in that recovery is oftenslow or incomplete. It causes demyelination secondary to the degenerationof the distal portion of the nerve. This effect occurs when a chemicalinterferes with the physiologic dynamics of the nerve, e.g., when it decreasesthe transport of nutrients to the nerve. The axon will degenerate (die-back)sufficiently to accommodate the cell's capacity to supply it with nutrients.Axonal degeneration can also occur as a result of biochemical or metabolicderangement of the central nervous system. Alkyl mercury and elementalmercury are examples of chemicals causing this type of effect (Cavanaugh1985).Central Nervous System EffectsThe mechanism of action of central nervous system toxins is not well understoodbut is believed to be associated with neurochemical alteration in the brain.Seizures, Parkinsonism, intellectual impairment, narcosis, dementia, cranialneuropathy, and visual disturbances are all examples of effects that canoccur after overexposures to neuropathic chemicals. The more serious CNSeffects, such as Parkinsonism, dementia, intellectual impairment, and cranialneuropathy, are generally irreversible (Baker 1983). Before these effectsare manifested, subtle changes in behavior may occur; if these subtle signsare interpreted correctly, exposure can be stopped before irreversibledamage occurs.Dose-Response Relationships and Neuropathic EffectsThe development of chemically induced neurological effects is believedto follow a dose-response pattern. At an exposure intensity or durationbelow the no-effect level, detectable effects are unlikely to be evident.As exposure intensity/duration increases to and beyond this level, thetoxin begins to interfere with the normal cellular processes of the neurologicalsystem. At this early stage, transient signs and symptoms may appear. Overteffects become more severe as exposure continues and finally progress toserious loss of neurological function and possible permanent damage toneural tissue. Increases in our ability to detect neurological changesat lower levels of exposure have shown that neurobehavioral changes orimpairment may occur at levels previously thought to be innocuous. Theseearly effects can be important indicators of potential functional impairmentat exposure levels below those that produce either transient or permanentdamage. Heavy metals, solvents, and pesticides are examples of chemicalsthat can cause symptoms that include nausea, sensory and motor functionimpairments, depression, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, andsexual dysfunction. Limits for substances in this group are generally designedto maintain worker exposures below the level associated with such symptoms.This approach ensures that employees will not be likely to suffer theseadverse symptoms and provides a margin of safety against the risk of moresevere or permanent neurological impairment.The following discussions describe OSHA's preliminary findings for allof the substances in this group and illustrate the serious nature of therisk faced by workers exposed to these toxicants.<ITAG tagnum="26">n-BUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 71-36-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1051</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for n-butyl-alcohol is a 100 ppm 8-hour TWA; the ACGIH-recommendedlimit is a 50 ppm ceiling, with a skin notation.n-Butyl alcohol is a colorless, highly refractive liquid with a mild vinousodor that has long been known to cause irritation of the eyes and headachesin occupational settings. Systemic exposure effects in the form of vestibularand auditory nerve injury have only been reported in workers in Franceand Mexico (Seitz 1972; Velasquez 1964; Velasquez et al. 1969).The current OSHA limit of 100 ppm (TWA) is based on the studies of Tabershaw,Fahy, and Skinner (1944) and of Smyth (1956). These studies indicated thatworkers experienced no narcotic or systemic effects at levels lower than100 ppm. Mild irritation was reported in humans exposed to 24 ppm; thisirritation became uncomfortable and was followed by headaches at 50 ppm(Nelson, Ege, Ross et al. 1943).More recent data reported by Seitz (1972), Velasquez (1964), and Velasquezet al. (1969) indicate serious long-term systemic effects on the auditorynerve and hearing loss (hypoacusia), the magnitude of hearing loss wasrelated to length of exposure. Nine of 11 workers exposed without hearingprotection to 80 ppm for periods of from 3 to 11 years displayed impairedhearing. This phenomenon was particularly evident in younger workers (Velasquez1964; Velasquez et al. 1969).OSHA believes that the current PEL of 100 ppm is not protective againstthe risk of hearing loss and vestibular injury associated with exposureto n-butyl alcohol, because these types of systemic injuries have beenobserved at levels below 100 ppm. A skin notation is also being proposedbecause of n-butyl alcohol's potential to cause skin irritation. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that the proposed 50 ppm ceiling will reduce thisrisk substantially. This health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for n-butyl alcohol if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLORINATED CAMPHENE (60 Percent)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8001-35-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>10</T2>Cl<T2>8</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1078</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 0.5 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation, for chlorinatedcamphene. The ACGIH recommends a limit of TLV-TWA 0.5 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STELof 1 mg/m\3\ for chlorinated camphene (60 percent), with a skin notation.This substance is an amber waxy solid with a pleasant, pine-like odor.Chlorinated camphene has demonstrated a moderately high acute toxicityin animal studies (ACGIH 1986, p. 114). Toxic doses cause varied centralnervous system effects, including nausea, muscle spasms, confusion, andconvulsions (Hayes 1963). Data indicate that rats and guinea pigs showno significant effects at dietary levels of 800 ppm daily for a 6-monthperiod (Alderson Reporting Co. 1972). Monkeys tolerate 10 ppm daily butshow toxic symptoms after 2 weeks' feeding at the 60-ppm level (Sosinerz1972). Although chlorinated camphene may accumulate in fatty tissues, itclears quickly when ingestion is terminated (Sosinerz 1972).In humans, the acute lethal dose of chlorinated camphene is between 2 and7 grams, and a dose of 10 mg/kg causes nonfatal convulsions in some exposedindividuals. The ACGIH (1986, p. 115) concludes that the acute toxicityof chlorinated camphene is equivalent to that of chlordane, for which thefatal human dose is estimated to be around 6 grams; the ACGIH TLV-TWA forchlordane is 0.5 mg/m\3\. One study of 25 human volunteers failed to revealtoxic responses to a daily 30-minute exposure to 500 mg/m\3\ for 10 consecutivedays, followed by similar exposures for 3 consecutive days 3 weeks later(Shelansky 1947, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 115). There are no reportsof occupational poisonings, and a review of the medical records of employeesengaged in the manufacture and handling of chlorinated camphene showedno ill effects in workers exposed for an average of 3.7 years (Hercules1972).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.5 mg/m\3\ TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 1.0mg/m\3\ for this insecticide, with a skin notation. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that both a TWA and a STEL are required to protect exposed workersagainst the risk of neuropathic and systemic effects. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for chlorinated camphene.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DECABORANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 17702-41-9; Chemical Formula: B<T2>10</T2>H<T2>14</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1114</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 ppm TWA and a skin notationfor decaborane. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm and a TLV-STELof 0.15 ppm, also with a skin notation. Decaborane forms colorless crystals,which are stable at ordinary temperatures and have a pungent odor.The acute toxicity of decaborane is extremely high for small laboratoryanimals. The 40-hour LC<T2>50</T2>s for rats and mice are 46 and 12 ppm, respectively (Schecter1958). Dermal LD<T2>50</T2>s for rabbits and rats are 71 and 740 ppm, respectively (Svirbely1955). Acute exposures to decaborane cause loss of coordination, convulsions,weakness, tremors, and hyperexcitability. Its primary effects are on thekidneys and liver. Studies of repeated exposures to this substance suggestthat the toxicity of decaborane is intermediate between that of pentaboraneand diborane. The ability of decaborane to penetrate the skin is particularlynotable, as is its toxicity to the central nervous system in some species,e.g., rats and rabbits (Svirbely 1954 and 1955). Monkeys showed decreasedability for certain operant behaviors when injected with doses of 3 to6 mg/kg decaborane (Reynolds et al. 1964). Central nervous system toxicityhas been observed in humans exposed occupationally (Krackow 1953).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.05 ppm TWA, a 15-minute STEL of0.15 ppm, and a skin notation for decaborane. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this level will provide protection against the risk of neuropathies,kidney and liver damage, and percutaneous absorption possible in the absenceof a short-term limit for decaborane. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for decaborane if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">di-sec-OCTYL PHTHALATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 117-81-7; Chemical formula: C<T2>24</T2>H<T2>38</T2>O<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1116</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA for di-sec-octyl phthalate.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STEL of 10 mg/m\3\for this light-colored, viscous, odorless, and combustible liquid.Di-sec-octyl phthalate (DEHP) has an extremely low acute oral toxicityin small laboratory animals. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> reported for the mouse is 26.3 g/kg; for the rat, it is 33.8g/kg (Krauskopf et al. 1973). No skin irritation or sensitization potentialhas been demonstrated in either animals or humans, and the lethal dermaldose in rabbits is about 25 ml/kg (Singh, Lawrence, and Autian 1972). Shaffer,Carpenter and Smyth (1945) and Lawrence (unpublished data) have reporteddeaths in exposed rats as well as chronic diffuse inflammation of the lung,resembling burn responses, after DEHP exposures in mice at unspecifiedlevels.Long-term dietary toxicity studies in rats, guinea pigs, and dogs haveestablished a no-effect dose level of about 60 mg/kg/day, and no carcinogenicor histologic abnormalities were observed at this level (Gesler 1973).Higher doses were associated with growth retardation and increased liverand kidney weights but not histologic abnormalities. Metabolic studieshave demonstrated that laboratory animals do not appreciably metabolizeDEHP (Dillingham and Autian 1983). Teratogenicity studies in pregnant ratsindicated that fertility is unaffected at doses of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.33 percentof the acute intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> dose for rats, although slight effects on embryonic and fetaldevelopment were observed in these animals; skeletal deformities were themost common teratogenic effects observed (Dillingham and Autian 1973).Mutagenic effects were observed at intravenous doses of one-third, one-half,and two-thirds of the acute LD<T2>50</T2>; these effects were consistent with DEHP's ability to producedominant lethal mutations (Dillingham and Autian 1973).A study of exposures to a mixture of the vapors of diethyl phthalate, dibutylphthalate, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate reported that exposures to 1 to6 ppm caused no phthalates in the blood and no peripheral polyneuritis(Raleigh, as cited in ACGIH, p. 223). However, Russian investigators examinedmale and female workers exposed to between 1.7 and 66 mg/m\3\ of variouscombinations of airborne phthalates and noted complaints of pain, numbness,and spasms in the upper and lower extremities after 6 to 7 years' exposure.Polyneuritis was observed in 32 percent of the workers studied, and 78percent of these workers showed depression of vestibular receptors (Milkovet al. 1973).OSHA proposes an 8-hour PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ and a 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m\3\for di-sec-octyl phthalate. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits together will protect workers from the risk of pain, numbness, spasmsof the extremities, and polyneuritis possible at excursions above the existing8-hour TWA PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for di-sec-octyl phthalate if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DICHLOROACETYLENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7572-29-4; Chemical Formula: C1C!CC1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1123</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for dichloroacetylene. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-ceiling of 0.1 ppm for this liquid, which explodes on boiling.In preliminary inhalation exposure studies, guinea pigs demonstrated a4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 20 ppm; death occurred 2 or 3 days after exposure and wascaused by pulmonary edema. In rats, similar exposures to dichloroacetylenein the presence of 330 ppm of trichloroethylene indicated an LC<T2>50</T2> of 55 ppm (Siegel, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 177). When dichloroacetylenewas mixed with 9 parts of ether, the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 219 ppm; in combination with 7 parts of trichloroethylene,the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 55 ppm; and exposure to dichloroacetylene with10 parts trichloroethylene caused a 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in guinea pigs of 15 ppm (Siegel et al. 1971).In humans, dichloroacetylene exposure causes headache, loss of appetite,extreme nausea, and vomiting; it affects the trigeminal nerve and facialmuscles and exacerbates facial herpes. Disabling nausea was experiencedby approximately 85 percent of individuals exposed for prolonged periodsof time (not further specified) at concentrations from 0.5 to 1 ppm (Saunders1967). A number of occupational fatalities have been attributed to exposureto dichloroacetylene (Humphrey ad McClelland 1944; Firth and Stuckey 1945).Humphrey and McClelland (1944) reported on 13 instances of cranial nervepalsy, nine of which had labial herpes, following exposure to dichloroacetylene.These patients also had symptoms of nausea, headache, jaw pain, and vomiting.Autopsies of two of these fatalities revealed edema at the base of thebrain (Humphrey and McClelland 1944).OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm for dichloroacetylene. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that exposure to dichloroacetylene posesa risk of disabling nausea and serious systemic effects to workers exposedto the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for dichloroacetylene.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL METHYL ETHER</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 34590-94-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>OC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>OC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1149</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for dipropylene glycolmethyl ether (DPGME), with a skin notation. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 100 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 150 ppm for this colorless liquid with a mild,pleasant, ethereal odor and a bitter taste.DPGME is a central nervous system and cardiac depressant. Dogs receivingintravenous injections of DPGME exhibited auricular fibrillation causedby auricular anoxia, depressed conduction, and heart block. Ventricularasystole accompanied increased intra-auricular pressure. Irritation andlocal pain preceded death from respiratory depression (Shideman and Procita1951). Rowe and associates (1954) reported a single acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats of 5.4 ml/kg. Even at the highest levels tested (notfurther specified), no single application of DPGME to the skin of rabbitswas lethal, although some narcosis and transient weight loss did occur.However, a significant number of deaths occurred in a group of rabbitstreated with 65 repeated dermal applications of 3 ml/kg and higher duringa 90-day period. Four animal species, including the monkey, were exposedrepeatedly to 7-hour daily inhalation exposures of between 300 and 400ppm DPGME; the animals exhibited narcosis and changes in the lung and liver(Rowe, McCollister, Spencer et al. 1954). Humans inhaling levels of 300 to 400 ppm found them very disagreeable,but 100 ppm was tolerable and, in the opinion of the authors, was not likelyto produce organic injury (Rowe, McCollister, Spencer et al. 1954). Patchtests on the skin of 250 human subjects produced neither irritation norsensitization (ACGIH 1986, p. 221). Humans exposed to DPGME vapor concentrationsat levels between 50 to 2000 ppm experienced eye, nose, and throat irritationbefore the onset of CNS impairment, which occurred at 1000 ppm in one oftwo subjects (Stewart, Baretta, Dodd, and Terkelson 1970). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 100 ppm TWA and a STEL of 150 ppm for dipropyleneglycol methyl ether. The Agency believes this combined limit will reducethe risk of central nervous system effects and irritation that may existwhen workers are exposed for short periods above the 100 ppm PEL. In addition,OSHA is proposing a skin notation because of evidence in experimental animalsthat DPGME can be percutaneously absorbed. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision of this level. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for dipropylene glycolmethyl ether if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">n-HEXANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-54-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>4</T2>CH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1200</ITAG>n-Hexane has been shown to produce distal axonopathy in both experimentalanimals and humans; it is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), whichis thought to be the causative agent of most of the adverse neurologicaleffects observed after exposure to hexane (Schaumburg et al. 1983). OSHA'scurrent PEL for n-hexane is 500 ppm. The ACGIH arrived at a TLV at 50 ppmfor this substance, based primarily on studies (Miyagaki 1967; Inoue etal. 1970) showing peripheral neuropathies at exposure levels as low as210 ppm. The REL for n-hexane recommended by NIOSH is 100 ppm (10-hourTWA). NIOSH based its recommendation on the same studies as those citedby the ACGIH (Miyagaki 1967; Inoue et al. 1970). NIOSH reasoned as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The absence of definitive epidemiologic or toxicologic evidence makesit difficult to determine how much lower the environmental limit shouldbe. Professional judgment suggests a TWA concentration of 350 mg/m\3\ (100ppm) offers a sufficient margin of safety to protect against the developmentof chronic nerve disorders in workers (NIOSH 1977a, p. 74).</ITAG>The adverse neurological effects of hexane exposure are manifested as bothsensory and motor dysfunction. Initially, there is a symmetric sensorynumbness of the hands and feet, with loss of pain, touch, and heat sensation.Motor weakness of the toes and fingers is often present; as the neuropathybecomes more severe, weakness of the muscles of the arms and legs may alsobe observed (Schaumburg et al. 1983). There are no known conditions thatpredispose an individual to hexane neurotoxicity (Schaumburg et al. 1983).The onset of neurological symptoms may not be evident for several monthsto a year after the beginning of exposure. Recovery may be complete, butseverely exposed individuals often retain some degree of sensorimotor deficit.The dose-response relationship for n-hexane exposure in humans is not welldefined, although it is clear that the severity of the resulting neuropathyincreases as the exposure level of n-hexane increases. A number of studieshave shown a consistent relationship between exposure levels of 500 ppm(OSHA's current exposure limit) to 2000 ppm and the development of characteristicperipheral neuropathies (Yamamura 1969; Yamada 1967). Neuropathic effectshave also been shown to occur at levels between 210 and 500 ppm (Takeuchiet al. 1975). Reports of effects occurring at levels of 210 to 500 ppm indicate thatthe current OSHA PEL of 500 ppm is not adequate to protect exposed workersfrom adverse sensorimotor neuropathic effects, and exposure at this levelthus represents a risk to workers. The decreased sensitivity to pain, touch,and temperature associated with n-hexane exposure can also make a workermore susceptible to injuries and accidents. Further, the delayed onsetof a clinical response, which is typical of hexane exposure, increasesthe probability that exposure will continue until irreversible effectsoccur. The NIOSH REL is 100 ppm. However, both the presence of peripheral neurophathiesat 210 ppm and the delay in onset of neurological symptoms indicate theneed to adopt the 50 ppm TLV to prevent development of these symptoms.Sampling data from the IMIS data base show that 75 percent of the samplesare below the 50 ppm level, and additional information confirms that attainingthis level is feasible. OSHA therefore proposes a PEL of 50 ppm TWA. Thishealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forn-hexane if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">2-HEXANONE (METHYL n-BUTYL KETONE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 591-78-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>8</T2>CO-CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1202</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for 2-hexanone is 100 ppm TWA; the NIOSH REL is 1 ppm(10-hour) TWA; and the ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm. Industrialexposure to 2-hexanone causes distal neuropathy manifesting as interferencewith motor and sensory function; even in cases characterized by minimalintensity, electrodiagnostic abnormalities were seen (ACGIH 1987). In animals,exposure to 2-hexanone causes axonal swelling and thinning of the myelinsheath. A metabolite of 2-hexanone, 2,5-hexanedione, appears to be responsiblefor the neural damage; this same metabolite is formed when n-hexane (discussedabove) is metabolized.The limit of 5 ppm TWA for 2-hexanone recommended by the ACGIH is basedon the results of several different studies. These include a study showingdecreases in sciatic-tibial nerve conduction in animals exposed to levelsof 75 ppm for 9 months (Johnson et at. 1979); another study reporting neuropathyin animals after 6 months of exposure to 50 ppm (Streletz, Duckett, andChambers 1976); and a study identifying 2,5-hexanedione in the serum ofhumans after a 1-day exposure to 50 ppm (diVincenzo, Kaplan, and Dedinas1976). The NIOSH REL for 2-hexanone of 1 ppm (10-hour TWA) is based on an epidemiologicstudy describing an outbreak of neurologic disease among workers in a plantthat manufactures printed fabrics (Allen et al. 1975, as cited in NIOSH1978). This study reported that a screening of 1,157 exposed workers revealed86 verified cases of distal neuropathy. 2-Hexanone was suspected of beingthe neurotoxicant because it had only recently been introduced into theprocess (Allen et al. 1975). When recommending its limit, NIOSH reliedon an industrial hygiene survey of the plant conducted by Billmaier etal. in 1974, which showed that 2-hexanone concentrations near the textileprinting machines ranged from 1 to 156 ppm (10-minute area samples). Afterreviewing this evidence, NIOSH concluded that the 1 ppm level could nota considered a no-effect level for 2-hexanone-induced neuropathy. The ACGIH (1987) stated that interpretation of the results of the Billmaierstudy was complicated because the exposure measurements reported in thestudy had been taken after the outbreak of neuropathic effects had occurred.In addition, the ACGIH pointed out that Billmaier et al. found poor workpractices at the plant (gloves were rarely used, employees washed theirhands with solvent, etc.), and thus dermal exposure may have contributedsubstantially to the outbreak. Both human and animal studies show the development of disease at exposurelevels below the existing 100 ppm PEL, clearly indicating the need to reducethis risk. There is disagreement regarding the interpretation of the reportedepidemiology study to substantiate the 1 ppm REL. At this time OSHA hasinadequate data to support feasibility at the 1 ppm level, while feasibilityat 5 ppm has been demonstrated. OSHA therefore proposes adoption of a 5-ppm(TWA) PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing arevision in this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for 2-hexanone if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">IRON PENTACARBONYL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13463-40-6; Chemical Formula: Fe(CO)<T2>5</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1216</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for iron pentacarbonyl. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.1 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 0.2 ppm, as iron, for this highlyflammable, oily, colorless-to-yellow liquid. In studies of rats, iron pentacarbonyl has been reported to have approximatelyone-third the acute toxicity of nickel carbonyl (for which ACGIH has recommendeda TLV of 0.05 ppm TWA) (Sunderman, West, and Kincaid 1959). In 1970, Gagefound that a 5.5-hour exposure at 33 ppm caused fatalities in three ofeight rats; four of eight animals died after two 5.5-hour exposures at18 ppm. At 7 ppm, no ill effects were observed in rats exposed 18 timesfor 5.5 hours (Gage 1970). There are no reports of long-term dose-responseexposure studies in laboratory animals, and no evidence exists that ironpentacarbonyl is carcinogenic in either man or animals (ACGIH 1986, p.327). Immediate symptoms of acute exposure to high concentrations of iron pentacarbonylinclude headache and dizziness, followed in 12 to 36 hours by fever, cyanosis,cough, and shortness of breath. The primary clinical effect is lung injury,although degenerative changes in the central nervous system have also beenreported (ACGIH 1986, p. 327). OSHA proposes a permissible exposure limit of 0.1 ppm TWA and a STEL of0.2 ppm for iron pentacarbonyl. OSHA preliminarily concludes that theselimits will protect exposed workers from the risk of headache, dizziness,fever, dyspnea, cyanosis, pulmonary injury, and central nervous systemeffects potentially associated with exposures at the levels permitted inthe absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for iron pentacarbonyl. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MERCURY (ARYL AND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6: Chemical Formula: Hg </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1240</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for all inorganic forms of mercury is 0.1 mg/m\3\Hg as a ceiling limit; this limit was adopted from ANSI standard Z37.8(1943). ACGIH currently recommends a 0.1 mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for aryl and inorganicmercury compounds. NIOSH (1973b) has recommended a 0.05 mg/m\3\ limit asan 8-hour TWA. In 1971, the ACGIH recommended a 0.05 mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for all forms ofmercury, including inorganic compounds. ANSI also reduced its standardto 0.05 mg/m\3\ in 1972, and NIOSH recommended the same limit in 1973.The 0.05 mg/m\3\ limit was based largely on the study of Smith et al. (1970)on workers exposed to mercury levels ranging from less than 0.1 to 0.27mg/m\3\ in chlor-alkali plants. The authors reported a significant dose-relatedincrease in the incidence of weight loss, tremors, abnormal reflexes, nervousness,and insomnia among workers exposed to 0.1 mg/m\3\ or more. There were slightincreases in the incidence of insomnia and loss of appetite among workersexposed to 0.1 mg/m\3\ or less. Smith et al. (1970) concluded that a limitof 0.1 mg/m\3\ contained little or no margin of safety. Other studies (Bidstrupet al. 1951; Turrian et al. 1956) have also reported symptoms of mercurypoisoning among workers exposed below 0.1 mg/m\3\. The 0.05 mg/m\3\ limitestablished by ACGIH, ANSI, and NIOSH also follows the 1968 recommendationof an international committee (Permanent Commission andamp; InternationalAssociation on Occupational Health 1968). In 1980, the ACGIH revised its recommended TLV for aryl and inorganic mercurycompounds to 0.1 mg/m\3\ Hg. In revising this limit, the ACGIH cited discrepanciesin the literature regarding the ratio of blood and urinary mercury levelsto airborne concentrations of mercury (Bell et al. 1973; Stopford et al.1978). These studies reported lower ratios of mercury body burden to airborneconcentration when personal sampling is used rather than area sampling.According to Bell et al. (1973), the lower ratio results because mercuryexposure measurements are generally found to be higher when personal samplingis conducted, presumably as a consequence of contamination of clothing.The ACGIH argued that the 0.05 mg/m\3\ limit may be too stringent to applywhen personal sampling is conducted. The ACGIH also stated that, unlikeelemental or alkyl mercury, little mercury is deposited in the brain followingexposure to aryl or inorganic mercury compounds. Based on this reasoning,the ACGIH adopted the higher 0.1 mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for aryl and inorganiccompounds of mercury. However, the ACGIH (1986) also noted that, althoughcentral nervous system effects are less likely to occur from exposure tomercury salts than from other forms of mercury, the risk of renal and oraleffects would ``presumably be just as great.'' Therefore, they cautionedthat the higher limit for mercury salts ``may be subject to debate'' (ACGIH1986). The 0.05 mg/m\3\ REL for the aryl and inorganic forms of mercurywas established in 1973 and has been superseded by the 1980 ACGIH TLV of0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA, which is based on more recent studies. However, adoptingthe TLV would constitute a deregulation of OSHA's current standard formercury. Because the health effects data available do not satisfy the requirementsfor deregulation, OSHA proposes to maintain its current 0.1 mg/m\3\ ceilingPEL.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYLACRYLONITRILE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 126-98-7: Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=C(CH<T2>3</T2>)C=N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH recommends a 1-ppm TLV-TWA with askin notation to protect workers who are occupationally exposed to methylacrylonitrile.Methylacrylonitrile has been shown to be extremely toxic in animals, bothby inhalation and dermal absorption. Beagles exposed for 90 days to 13.5ppm convulsed and lost motor control in their hind limbs. Microscopic brainlesions were detected in one of the dogs. The level at which no effectswere detected was determined to be between 3.2 ppm and 8.8 ppm (ACGIH 1986).Neuropathic effects in dogs at levels of exposure below 8.8 ppm indicatethat, in the absence of an exposure limit, occupational exposure to methylacrylonitrile may be associated with a risk of neurological impairment.OSHA believes that establishing a 1 ppm PEL (which provides for a marginof safety below the observed no-effect level in dogs) and a skin notationwill reduce the risk of neurological impairment that currently exists inthe absence of an OSHA limit for this substance. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for methylacrylonitrile. Atthe time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce a significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYL BROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-83-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>Br</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1253</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for methyl bromide is a 20 ppm ceiling, while the ACGIHlimit is 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. NIOSH recommendsthat the REL for this substance be set at the lowest feasible level. Acutepoisoning from methyl bromide is characterized by lung irritation, pulmonaryedema, convulsions, and coma. Chronic exposure to low concentrations ofmethyl bromide generally produces central nervous system effects, includingmuscle weakness and pain, incoordination, inability to focus one's eyes,and behavioral changes (ACGIH 1986; Craft 1983). The onset of neurologicalsigns and symptoms is delayed for several hours to a few days after exposure.Methyl bromide is a gas and an inhalation hazard, although it can alsobe absorbed through the skin. A report by Hine (1969) notes that methylbromide has been responsible for more deaths among occupationally exposedworkers in California than the organophosphates. It is hypothesized thatmethyl bromide has a greater potential for toxicity than other organicbromides, because its greater lipophilicity provides increased access tothe brain.Various studies demonstrate methyl bromide's toxicity in humans. Ingram(1951) reports ill effects (symptoms not specified) after exposure to methylbromide at concentrations of 100 ppm. Similar exposure concentrations werealso reported by Hine (1969) in a case study of two date packers in California.Johnson (1977) indicates that 34 packers became sick when exposed to anaverage methyl bromide concentration of 50 ppm, although concentrationsin the packing room may have been as high as 100-150 ppm during the purgingof a fumigation chamber.Watrous (1942) described nausea, vomiting, and headache in 90 workers whowere exposed for 2 weeks to concentrations ``generally below'' 35 ppm.These symptoms emphasized the need to create a TLV to protect workers fromthe nausea, vomiting, and headaches associated with lower levels of exposure.This need is strengthened by the fact that since these symptoms are usuallydelayed in onset, workers may not have sufficient warning of this substance'spotential neurotoxicity.The presence of neurologic symptoms at levels below 35 ppm indicates thata ceiling limit of 20 ppm is not adequate to protect workers from the effectsof methyl bromide poisoning. OSHA proposes a PEL of 5 ppm TWA, with a skinnotation, to more adequately protect workers against these incapacitatingsymptoms and to reduce this existing risk substantially. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for methyl bromideif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MANGANESE FUME</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-96-5; Chemical Formula: MnO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Becauseof its potential for damage to the lungs and central nervous system, theACGIH recommends an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/m\3\ and a 3-mg/m\3\ STEL for manganesefume.Symptoms of manganese poisoning range from sleepiness and weakness in thelegs (Fairhall 1957) to difficulty in walking and uncontrolled laughter(Fairhall and Neal 1943). Health surveys of employees exposed to manganesefume have demonstrated a high incidence of pneumonia in these workers (Davies1946). Tanaka and Lieben (1969) found seven cases of pneumonia and 15 borderlinecases of pneumonia among 144 workers exposed to manganese dust or fumeconcentrations greater than 5 mg/m\3\; three of these cases were associatedwith fume rather than dust exposure. Those workers exposed to fume levelsbelow 5 mg/m\3\ exhibited no signs of pneumonia. In a separate study bySmyth, Ruhf, Whitman, and Dugan (1973), 3 cases of manganese poisoningwere detected among 71 employees exposed to levels of 13.3 mg/m\3\ fume.OSHA is proposing a 1-mg/m\3\ TWA and a 3-mg/m\3\ STEL for manganese fume.The Agency preliminarily concludes that both a TWA limit and STEL are requiredto protect exposed employees from the risk of manganese poisoning, lungdamage, and pneumonia associated with exposure to these fumes. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for manganesefume.

No. 1237</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for exposure to manganese cyclopentadienyltricarbonyl (MCT). The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.1 mg/m\3\ (as manganese),with a skin notation.A Russian study reported that a single 2-hour exposure to MCT at 120 mg/m\3\was fatal to 80 percent of albino rats, although rabbits, guinea pigs,and rats survived a single 2-hour exposure at 20 to 40 mg/m\3\. Chronicexposure of rats for 11 months at levels averaging 1 mg/g\3\ for 4 hoursdaily showed delayed effects (7 months from onset of exposure) on neuromuscularexcitability, evidence of kidney damage, and decreased resistance to infection(Arkipova, Tolgskaya, and Kocketkova 1965). The tails of 10 white micewere dipped in a gasoline mixture containing 1 gram MCT per 100 ml; a secondgroup of mice had their tails immersed in gasoline without MCT. An equalnumber of fatalities were observed in the gasoline plus MCT and gasolineonly groups after four or five 2-hour applications, and all tails exhibitednecrosis. The authors concluded that these effects were caused by the gasolineand not by the MCT (Arkipova, Tolgskaya, and Kocketkova 1965). Furtherstudies in rabbits showed that MCT applied dermally as an oil emulsioncaused irritation of the skin. These authors also investigated the dermaltoxicity of tetrahydrofuran in MCT solutions versus tetrahydrofuran inoil. All animals whose tails had been dipped in the hydrofuran solutionof MCT died within an hour, while animals whose tails had been dipped inpure tetrahydrofuran did not (Arkipova, Tolgskaya, and Kocketkova 1965).The same authors concluded that MCT is toxic at low concentrations, hascumulative properties, affects the nervous system, is irritating to theskin, and causes early histological changes in the respiratory tract.More recent reports describe MCT-induced pulmonary edema and convulsionsin the rat (Penney et al. 1985). The ED<T2>50</T2>s for convulsions were 32 mg/kg orally and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally;LD<T2>50</T2>s were 24 mg/kg orally and 14 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Necrosisof the bronchiolar tissue and pulmonary parenchymal damage were seen inmice and rats given intraperitoneal doses (Haschek et al. 1982).OSHA has preliminary concluded that occupational exposure to MCT posesa risk of neuropathic effects, kidney damage, skin irritation, pulmonaryedema, and tissue damage. The Agency is therefore proposing an 8-hour TWAPEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for manganese cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl, with a skinnotation, to protect workers against the risk of these effects, which havebeen shown to occur at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHAlimit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit for manganese cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MANGANESE TETROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1317-35-7; Chemical Formula: Mn<T2>3</T2>O<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1238</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for manganese tetroxide (compounds and fume).The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 1 mg/m\3\, as manganese, for this brownish-blackpowder and its fume. Ferromanganese fume has been determined by x-ray diffractionanalysis to consist primarily of manganese tetroxide.Findings from a Russian study indicated that intratracheal suspensionsof manganese oxide, manganese dioxide, and manganese tetroxide particles(particle size less than 3um) produced pneumonitis and other similar pulmonaryeffects in rats (Levina and Robachevsky 1955). These investigators alsodetermined that manganese tetroxide has a greater toxicity than the loweroxides of manganese and that freshly prepared oxides were more potent thanthose stored for 6 months to a year.Two cases of manganese fume poisoning were reported in a plant where concentrationswere between 2.7 and 4.7 mg/m\3\ (Whitlock, Kimuso, and Bittenbender 1966),but other investigators have questioned these air analysis data and believethat exposures to manganese tetroxide concentrations of 5 mg/m\3\ or lesscause no harmful effects (Whitman and Brandt 1966). In a 7-year study,Smyth and co-workers investigated chronic manganese poisoning in workersexposed to both ferromanganese fumes and dust. Five of 71 employees sufferedfrom chronic manganism; of these five cases, three resulted from fume exposureand two from dust exposure. Two of the three fume-exposure victims wereexposed over a 5-year period to an estimated average ferromanganese concentrationof 13.3 mg/m\3\; however, the third victim worked in an operation whereair concentrations of manganese were less than 1 mg/m\3\, which suggeststhat certain individuals may be hypersusceptible to manganese poisoning.The dust-exposed victims worked in areas where air concentrations werein the range of 30 to 50 mg/m\3\ throughout the study period (Smyth, Ruhf,Whitman, and Dugan 1973).Martonik (cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 357) reports that the fume has greatertoxicity than the dust. During a 2-year period, at least one case of acutemanganese poisoning was documented at a fume concentration level of 7.5mg/m\3\ and another case at the same welding operation may have been manganism.OSHA is proposing a 1 mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA for manganese tetroxide (compoundsand fume). The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will provideprotection against the risk of chronic manganese poisoning, pneumonitis,and other respiratory effects associated with exposure to manganese tetroxideat the levels presently permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit formanganese tetroxide. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MERCURY (VAPOR)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1241</ITAG>OSHA currently has a ceiling limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for mercury (includingvapor). The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for mercury vapor,measured as mercury, and a skin notation. Elemental mercury is a silvery,odorless, heavy liquid.Inhalation of high concentrations of mercury vapor for relatively briefperiods can cause pneumonitis, bronchitis, chest pain, dyspnea, coughing,stomatitis, gingivitis, salivation, and diarrhea (NIOSH 1973; Ashe, Largent,Dutra et al. 1953). Chronic mercurialism is manifested by central nervoussystem effects, including tremor, a variety of neuropsychiatric disturbances,and loss of appetite (Kazantzis 1968; Smith, Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney1970).Severe organ damage occurred in rabbits exposed for 4 hours to an averagevapor concentration of 28.8 mg/m\3\. Damage was observed in the kidneys,liver, brain, heart, lungs, and colon (Ashe, Largent, Dutra et al. 1953).The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats for mercuric vapor is 18 mg/kg (NTIS PB 214-270, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 358). A study by Smith, Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney(1970) indicated that workers in the chlorine-producing industry who wereexposed to mercury showed that chronic exposures to a 1-mg/m\3\ vapor concentrationproduced no effects in these workers. Six of 75 workers regularly exposedto 0.05 to 0.1 mg/m\3\ of mercury vapor in a glassware manufacturing plantreported insomnia, and one was found to have tremors (Danziger and Possick1973). One of 11 workers employed in a mercury mine or refining plant andexposed at vapor concentrations below 0.1 mg/m\3\ had sore gums, looseteeth, or excess salivation (Rentos and Seligman 1968).NIOSH (1973) has recommended a 10-hour TWA limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for inorganicmercury and concluded that hyperactivity, rather than tremor, may be themost typical symptom of chronic mercurialism. Two studies report no evidenceof mercury vapor poisoning in industrial settings where characteristicexposures ranged between 0.05 and 0.1 mg/m\3\ (Danziger and Possick 1973;McGill et al. 1964).In workers exposed at levels about 0.1 mg/m3, toxic symptoms were seen(Rentos and Seligman 1968). Turrian, Grandjean, and Turrian (1956) foundthat 33 percent of workers exposed to the vapor at levels above 0.05 mg/m3had erethism, while only 8 percent of those exposed below this level manifestedthis symptom. About 20 percent of workers in both groups exhibited tremor.The ACGIH notes that, after exposure to the vapor, ``a relatively highpercentage of the absorbed mercury remains in the brain'' compared withthe amount deposited in the brain after exposure to the aryl and inorganiccompounds (ACGIH 1986, p. 359). The ACGIH accordingly recommends a higherTLV-TWA for these compounds.  OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.05 mg/m3 TWA for mercury vapor, with a skin notation.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the risk of acute and chronic mercury poisoning that exists fromworkplace exposures to this vapor at levels above 0.05 mg/m3. The skinnotation is proposed because the vapors of elemental mercury can be readilyabsorbed through the skin. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for mercury (vapor) if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MERCURY, (ORGANO) ALKYL COMPOUNDS  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1242</ITAG>OSHA has a current PEL of 0.01 mg/m3 TWA and a ceiling limit of 0.04 mg/m3for the alkyl compounds of mercury. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.01mg/m3 and a TLV-STEL of 0.03 mg/m3 for these compounds, as mercury. A skinnotation is also recommended by the ACGIH. Alkyl mercury compounds includevolatile liquids, such as dimethyl and diethyl mercury, as well as manycomplex salts, which are usually solids.  Alkyl mercury compounds pose greater health hazards than do the inorganiccompounds or mercury because they can penetrate the blood-brain barrierand the placenta very quickly. The primary toxic effects associated withexposure to the organic compounds of mercury are injuries to the centraland peripheral nervous systems and to the kidneys (Casarett and Doull 1975).In addition, data concerning mouse and rat exposures to alkyl mercury compoundshave demonstrated toxicity to the gastrointestinal system, pancreas, liver,gonads, and cardiovascular system. Suppression of the immune system andimpairment of the endocrine system have also been demonstrated (Shakbazyanet al. 1977). Fatalities in mice have been reported at exposures of 10to 30 mg/m3 for 3 to 5 hours (Trakhtenberg 1950).  Methyl mercury is among the most damaging of the alkyl compounds to humansbecause it accumulates in the body and causes developmental effects (Wilson1977). A 3-month exposure to approximately 1 mg/m3 diethyl mercury causeddeath in two individuals (Hill 1943). Another fatal case of alkyl mercurypoisoning has also been described (Hook, Lundgren, and Swensson 1954).On the basis of his work with laboratory animals, Trakhtenberg (1950) statedthat even a concentration as low as 0.00001 mg/m3 could not be toleratedby humans on a continuing basis. However, a later study reported no consistent,acute effects of mercury poisoning at air concentrations between 0.01 and0.1 mg/m3, despite the fact that brief excursions considerably above thisrange occurred (Dinman, Evans, and Linch 1958).  OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.01 mg/m3 TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 0.03mg/m3 for the alkyl compounds of mercury, with a skin notation. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that exposure to the alkyl mercury compounds posesa risk of severe neuropathic and other systemic injury. The Agency believesthat both the short-term and 8-hour limits are necessary to reduce theserisks and that the skin notation will protect against the dermal absorptionpossible in the absence of any OSHA limit or skin notation. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for mercury,(organo) alkyl compounds if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PENTABORANE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 19624-22-7; Chemical Formula: B<T2>5</T2>H<T2>9</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Pentaborane is a colorless liquid with a strong and penetratingodor.  In both humans and animals, inhalation of pentaborane vapor causes centralnervous system effects (Svirbely 1954; Rozendaal 1951; Lowe and Freeman1957; Cordasco, Cooper, Murphy, and Anderson 1962).  The 5-minute LC<T2>50</T2> for rats and mice is 67 and 40 ppm, respectively; for 60 minutes,these values are 10 and 6 ppm for rats and mice, respectively (Weir, Bath,and Weeks 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 459). Rats exposed repeatedlyto 3-ppm pentaborane by inhalation exhibited tremors, hyperexcitability,belligerency, and weight loss (Svirbely 1954). Rats, rabbits, monkeys,and dogs exposed repeatedly to pentaborane vapor at concentrations of 1ppm for 4 weeks or 0.2 ppm for 6 months lost weight (Levinkas, Paslian,and Bleckman 1958). In the same experiments, rats and rabbits exposed at1 ppm showed reduced activity and impaired locomotor ability, respectively,and monkeys and dogs exhibited apathy, loss of appetite, insensitivityto pain, loss of mobility, tremor, and impaired coordination. The ACGIH(1986, p. 459) notes that the 0.2 ppm concentration reported in the Levinkaset al. study (1958) was a calculated rather than measured value and thatthe actual exposure level was probably closer to 0.01 ppm.  Humans accidentally overexposed to pentaborane experience tremors, convulsions,behavioral changes, loss of memory, impaired judgment, and other symptomsof central nervous system intoxication (Svirbely 1954; Rozendaal 1951;Lowe and Freeman 1957; Cordasco, Cooper, Murphy, and Anderson 1962).  OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.005 ppm for pentaborane and a STELof 0.015 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits willprotect workers against the risk of central nervous system effects, suchas tremors and convulsions, behavioral changes, and loss of judgment, potentiallyassociated with exposure to pentaborane at levels only slightly above thosethat would be premitted by the 8-hour TWA alone. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for pentaborane if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PHENYL MERCAPTAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-98-5; Chemical Formula C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>SH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1316</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for phenyl mercaptan. The ACGIH recommends aTLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm. NIOSH recommends a 15-minute ceiling limit of 0.1 ppmfor phenyl mercaptan (benzenethiol). Phenyl mercaptan is a colorless liquidwith an offensive, garlic-like odor.The primary acute hazards of exposure to phenyl mercaptan are central nervoussystem stimulation followed by post-convulsive CNS depression, severe eyeand skin irritation, systemic toxicity to spleen, kidney, lung, and livertissues, and narcotic effects (ACGIH 1986, p. 478).Phenyl mercaptan has been reported to have 4-hour inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> values of 33 and 28 ppm for rats and mice, respectively (Doulland Plzak 1962; Fairchild and Stokinger 1958). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat is reported to be 46 mg/kg (McCord and Witheridge1949; Robles 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 478). For the rabbit andrat, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> values are 134 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, respectively (Doull andPlzak 1962; Fairchild and Stokinger 1958; Schafer 1972). The responsesof animals to exposure to phenyl mercaptan were uniform regardless of speciesand progressed from CNS stimulation to incoordination, skeletal and muscularparalysis, respiratory depression, followed at high concentrations by comaand death. High doses (not further specified) administered via inhalationproduced lung, liver, and kidney changes in mice (Doull and Plzak 1962;Fairchild and Stokinger 1958; Schafer 1972). In rabbits, phenyl mercaptanis a severe eye and skin irritant (McCord and Witheridge 1949; Robles 1975;Schafer 1972).In humans, phenyl mercaptan is a moderately toxic skin irritant and causessevere dermatitis, headaches, and dizziness at unspecified levels (Fairchildand Stokinger, 1958; McCord and Witheridge 1949).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.5 ppm for phenyl mercaptan.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers from the risk of CNS effects, skin irritation, and systemic injurypotentially associated with occupational exposure to phenyl mercaptan atthe uncontrolled levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit forphenyl mercaptan. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate anew limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PROPYLENE GLYCOL DINITRATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 6423-43-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>6</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1342</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for propylene glycol dinitrate. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm, with a skin notation. When freshly prepared, propyleneglycol dinitrate is a colorless liquid with a disagreeable odor.Exposure to this substance affects blood pressure, causes methemoglobinuriaand respiratory toxicity, injures liver and kidney tissues, and distortsvision. It can also cause headache and incoordination.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> value for the rat is between 480 and 250 mg/kg (Clark and Litchfield1969; Andersen and Mehl 1973), and the subcutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> is 530 mg/kg (Andersen and Mehl 1973). Mice are reported tobe somewhat more resistant, with a subcutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> of slightly more than 1200 mg/kg; however, cats appear to beeven more susceptible to propylene glycol dinitrate with a subcutaneousLD<T2>50</T2> of between 200 and 300 mg/kg (Clark and Litchfield 1969). Inall species studied, death occurs by anoxia, which is caused by almostcomplete conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin (Clark and Litchfield1969). Skin tests in albino rabbits did not produce irritation, but ocularinstillation caused transient conjunctival redness (Jones, Strickland,and Siegel 1972). Twenty-day skin exposures in rabbits at 1 g/kg showedminor irritation, and at 2 g/kg, rabbits became weak and cyanotic; oneof five rabbits died, and this animal's hemoglobin and hematocrit valueshad decreased. When the dose was increased to 4 g/kg, the rabbits methemoglobinvalues rose to 34.5 percent at death, an indication, along with elevatedserum and urinary nitrate levels, that propylene glycol dinitrate is readilyabsorbed through the skin (Jones, Strickland, and Siegel 1972). Continuous90-day inhalation exposures in dogs at 10 ppm showed kidney and liver changes;exposures at 35 ppm caused heavy iron deposits in the liver, spleen, andkidneys. Female (but not male) rats showed a drop in blood pressure within30 minutes after injection of doses above 5 mg/kg. Rhesus monkeys displayedmydriasis in 90-day exposures at 35 ppm but no change in avoidance behaviorduring a visual discrimination and acuity threshold test (Jones, Strickland,and Siegel 1972).In humans, 8-hour exposures to 0.2 ppm or higher propylene glycol dinitrateresulted in visual distortion and headache (Stewart et al. 1974). Subjectsdeveloped a tolerance for the headache response, but the visual effectswere cumulative. Impaired balance occurred after 6.5 hours of exposureat 0.5 ppm, and a 40-minute exposure at 1.5 ppm caused eye irritation.Subjects exposed at 0.5 ppm for 8 hours experienced a consistent elevationin diastolic pressure but no pulmonary irritation. At concentrations of0.03 to 1.5 ppm, no hematologic effects were observed (Stewart et al. 1974).Studies of human exposures to levels below 0.1 ppm do not report evidenceof chronic neurotoxicity (Horvath et al. 1981).OSHA proposes a TWA limit of 0.05 ppm, with a skin notation, for propyleneglycol dinitrate. The Agency believes that this limit will protect workersagainst the risk of hepatotoxic, hematologic, and central nervous systemeffects that exists from workplace exposure in the absence of any OSHAPEL. The skin notation is proposed to protect against the risk of skinabsorption. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for propylene glycol dinitrate. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.Preliminary ConclusionsOSHA preliminary concludes that risks are associated with occupationalexposure to the group of neuropathic toxicants shown in Table C1-1. Theeffects caused by such exposures include brain lesions, nausea, vomiting,general depression of the central nervous system, interference with sensoryand motor functions, and alterations in the ability of the brain to processinformation. Affected workers may experience drowsiness, dizziness, lossof ability to concentrate, mood changes, reduced awareness, learning difficulty,unsteadiness, and auditory and visual disturbances. In addition, employeesexperiencing these effects are at risk and are likely to hurt themselvesor others in accidents caused by their reduced functional capacity. OSHAbelieves that the health evidence for these neurotoxins forms a reasonablebasis for proposing new or revised limits. At the time of the final rule,the Agency will establish these limits if it determines that significantrisk will be substantially reduced thereby.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Substances for Which Proposed Limits are Based on Avoidance ofNarcosis Effects</ITAG>IntroductionProposed limits for 19 substances are based primarily on evidence showingthat occupational exposure to these substances causes narcosis. The narcoticeffects of exposure to substances such as alcohols, aliphatic hydrocarbons,and chlorinated hydrocarbons have been recognized in industry as seriousadverse effects for many years. Table C2-1 lists these chemicals, theirCAS and HS numbers, and their OSHA, ACGIH, and NIOSH limits. For sevenof these substances, the Agency proposes to lower the 8-hour limit andto revise or add a STEL. In five cases, the 8-hour limit will remain thesame and a proposed STEL will be added. Eight-hour TWAs and/or STELs arebeing proposed for four previously unregulated substances; in two cases,OSHA is proposing the NIOSH REL, and, in the remaining case, an existinglimit would be replaced by a new value.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 163-165</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsNarcosis is the result of general depression of central nervous system(CNS) function. When the CNS becomes sufficiently depressed, the awarenessor consciousness of exposed workers is affected. Initial symptoms of narcosisinclude drowsiness, difficulty in concentration, and mood changes; thesemay progress to slurred speech, dizziness, and loss of coordination, and,in more severe cases, loss of consciousness, coma and death. Except inmore serious cases, CNS depression is reversible on removal from exposureand causes no permanent damage to the CNS. However, because narcosis adverselyaffects workers' concentration and coordination, there is an increasedrisk of injuries and accidents caused by mistakes and errors in judgment.The mechanism by which substances induce narcosis is poorly understood.CNS depressants may have the same mechanism of action as general anesthetics,which appear to produce a reversible effect on electrically excitable neuronalmembranes.Dose-Response Relationship and Narcotic EffectsThe induction of narcosis following exposure to narcotic agents is expectedto follow the classical S-shaped (sigmoidal) dose-response relationship.As exposure level increases, both the percent of exposed persons affectedand the severity of the effect will increase. Although it is not knownwhether a true threshold exists for the occurrence of the molecular eventsleading to narcosis (i.e., disruption of electrical impulses in neurons),there is usually a level at which most exposed individuals will manifestthe onset of symptoms associated with narcosis. The no-effect level fora particular substance will be determined largely by individual susceptibility,the extent to which the material is absorbed, and the rate at which itis metabolized and eliminated.The following discussion describes OSHA's preliminary findings for thesubstances in this group and illustrates the potentially serious consequencesof workplace exposure to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="26">BUTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-97-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>10</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1044</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for butane. the ACGIH recommends a thresholdlimit value of 800 ppm TWA for this colorless, flammable gas.The primary risk of exposure to butane is its ability to cause narcosisat high exposure levels. Exposure to 10,000 ppm for 10 minutes causes drowsiness,but there are no reports of systemic toxicity or irritation (Gerarde 1963).In rats, the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for butane is 658 gm/m3, or about 280,000 ppm (NIOSH 1977).Humans exposed to 1000 ppm for a single 8-hour day, or to 500 ppm for 2-weekperiods of 8-hour workdays, showed no harmful subjective or abnormal physiologicalresponses but did show a reduced visual evoked response (VER) wave amplitudeduring the second week (Stewart et al. 1977).OSHA is proposing a permissible exposure limit of 800 ppm TWA for butane.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers against the risk of narcosis and drowsiness potentially associatedwith exposures at previously uncontrolled levels. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for butane. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">sec-BUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-92-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CHOHCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1049</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for sec-butyl alcohol is 150 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm, with a 15-minute STEL of 150ppm. sec-Butyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a strong, wine-like odor.The acute toxicity of sec-butyl alcohol is reported to be lower than thatof n-butanol, for which OSHA is proposing a ceiling of 50 ppm. The oralLD<T2>50</T2>s in rats for these two substances are 6.5 g/kg for sec-butylalcohol and 4.4 g/kg for n-butanol, respectively (Smyth, Carpenter, andWeil 1951). Liquid sec-butyl alcohol is less injurious to the eyes thanliquid n-butanol (ACGIH 1986, p. 77). Occupational exposures to sec-butylalcohol at levels of about 100 ppm were reported not to be associated withdifficulties (Bank, unpublished communication, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 77).OSHA proposes to reduce the permissible exposure limit for sec-butyl alcoholto 100 ppm TWA, and to include a 150-ppm STEL, to afford adequate protectionagainst the risk of narcosis and irritation caused by short-term elevatedexposures. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing arevision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for sec-butyl alcohol if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">tert-BUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CASL 75-65-0; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>COH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1050</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 100 ppm for tert-butyl alcohol. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm, with a TLV-STEL of 150 ppm. At ordinarytemperatures and pressures, tert-butyl alcohol exists in the form of colorlesshygroscopic crystals (ACGIH 1986).Although similar to the other butyl alcohols in many respects, tert-butylalcohol is more volatile and has a greater potential for narcotic effects(Weese 1928). Mice exposed to t-butyl alcohol exhibit a stronger narcoticresponse than they show when exposed to normal or iso-butyl alcohol (Weese1928). Repeated daily doses of t-butyl alcohol that produced narcosis werenot fatal in animals (Schaffarzick and Brown 1952). In humans, contactwith t-butyl alcohol produces erythema and hyperemia (Oetel 1936).OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppm for tert-butyl alcohol, witha 15-minute STEL of 150 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that thiscombination of limits will protect against the risk of narcosis permittedat elevated short-term levels. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for tert-butyl alcohol if the Agency determinesthat this limit will subtantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CYCLOPENTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 287-92-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1111</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for cyclopentane. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 600 ppm for this flammable, mobile liquid.The few existing animal data indicate the cyclopentane is a central nervoussystem depressant. As with other alicyclic hydrocarbons, high concentrationscause excitement, loss of equilibrium, stupor, coma, and, rarely, respiratoryfailure (Gerard 1963). No major toxicological animal studies on the effectsof cyclopentane exposure have been reported, and evaluations of the toxicproperties of this substance have therefore relied on the animal data forn-pentane. n-Pentane has been shown to cause narcosis in animals at exposuresof 90,000 to 120,000 ppm for 5 to 60 minutes (Abritti et al. 1976). Swann(1974) reported that a concentration of 130,000 ppm is fatal. Almost nodata are available concerning the chronic effects of cyclopentane exposure.Abritti et al. (1976) report that petroleum solvents used in the Italianshoe industry contain up to 18 percent cyclopentane. Workers exposed tothese solvents have been observed to suffer from polyneuropathy, and Oettelreported in 1936 that skin exposure to such solvents caused burning andskin blistering after 15 minutes of confined contact. It has not been determinedwhether the irritation was caused by cyclopentane or by other substances,such as n-hexane, in the solvent.OSHA is proposing a PEL of 600 ppm TWA for this substance. OSHA has preliminarilyconcluded that occupational exposure to cyclopentane poses a risk of irritationand narcosis at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor cyclopentane. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate anew limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYL BROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-96-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>Br</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1163</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm for ethyl bromide. TheACGIH also recommends a limit of 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and in additionrecommends a 15-minute STEL of 250 ppm. Ethyl bromide is a colorless, highlyvolatile, and flammable liquid with an ether-like odor; it becomes yellowwhen exposed to light and air.The concentrations of ethyl bromide reported as lethal to guinea pigs are3200 ppm for 9 hours and 1700 ppm for 12.5 hours (Sayers, Yant, Thomas,and Berger 1929). Von Oettingen (1955) reported the minimal lethal concentrationof this substance for mice as 3500 ppm.Ethyl bromide acts as a central nervous system depressant (narcotic); additionally,exposure irritates the lungs and causes congestion and fatty degenerationof the liver, intestinal hemorrhage, and kidney swelling. Several deathshave been reported from the use of ethyl bromide as general anesthetic(von Oettingen 1955).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and a 15-minute STELof 250 ppm for ethyl bromide. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits will work to reduce the risk of narcosis, kidney and liver damage,and respiratory irritation associated with occupational exposure to elevatedlevels of ethyl bromide. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis forproposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill establish a new limit for ethyl bromide if the Agency determines thatthis limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">GASOLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8006-61-9; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1185</ITAG>There is no current OSHA PEL for gasoline. The ACGIH has established a300-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 500-ppm 15-minute STEL.Studies have shown that exposure to 2000 ppm of gasoline for 30 minutesproduces mile anesthesia, while exposure to concentrations between 500and 900 ppm for 1 hour produces dizziness (Gerarde 1963; Runion 1975).However, these authors also found that people exposed to gasoline at concentrations160 to 270 ppm for several hours do not experience any symptoms of narcosis.OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 300 ppm, supplemented by a STEL of 500ppm to ensure that levels do not exceed 300 ppm for any length of time;these limits are intended to protect against the early symptoms of narcosis.OSHA preliminarily concludes that uncontrolled exposure to gasoline placeexposed employees at risk of experiencing drowsiness, headaches, dizziness,and loss of coordination. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for gasoline. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEPTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 142-82-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)CH<T2>5</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1194</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for heptane is 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIHTLVs for heptane are 400 ppm as a TWA and 500 ppm as a STEL. NIOSH (1977a)has recommended that workplace exposures not exceed 85 ppm as a 10-hourTWA or 440 ppm as a 15-minute ceiling limit.Patty and Yant (1939) reported that exposure to 1,000 ppm for 6 minutescaused slight dizziness in humans; exposures to higher levels caused vertigo,incoordination, and hilarity. They also reported that a 4-minute exposureto 5,000 ppm produced complaints of nausea and loss of appetite. Basedon this information, as well as animal data showing 10,000 to 15,000 ppmas being an effect level for narcosis (Fuhner 1921), the ACGIH concludedthat heptane was more acutely toxic than hexane. They therefore recommendedlimits that are somewhat lower than for hexane isomers.As discussed above in the discussions on pentane and hexane isomers, NIOSHhas recommended the same occupational limits for all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes (i.e., 350 mg/m3 TWA and 1800 mg/m3 as a 15-minute ceiling).This recommendation considers that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes possess potential neurotoxic capability similar to thatof n-hexane. The ACGIH disagrees with this concept, believing that theneurotoxicity caused by exposure to n-hexane is the result of a uniquemetabolite, 2,5-hexanedione.Because heptane is considered to be more acutely toxic than hexane, OSHApreliminarily concludes that it is appropriate to revise its limit forheptane to a level below that of hexane isomers and, thus, reduce the riskof narcosis. Therefore, OSHA proposes to revise its limit for heptane to400 ppm TWA and 500 ppm STEL. As in the case of hexane isomers and pentane,OSHA solicits comment on the evidence that heptane is potentially neuropathic.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEXANE ISOMERS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>5</T2>; n(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>4</T2>C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1201</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for the hexane isomers. The ACGIH TLVs for hexaneisomers are 500 ppm TWA and 1000 ppm STEL. NIOSH has a recommended TWAlimit for these isomers of 100 ppm, supplemented by a 510-ppm (15 min)ceiling. A study by Drinker et al. (1943) shows that humans exposed to 1400 to 1500ppm of hexane experienced nausea and headache. Patty and Yant (1929) foundthat a 10-minute exposure to 5000 ppm caused giddiness and dizziness inexposed subjects. A study by Nelson et al. (1943) showed no effects inunacclimated subjects exposed to hexane isomers in concentrations of 500ppm, but narcotic effects have often been seen in people exposed at levelsabove 100 ppm (Elkins 1959). The ACGIH based its recommendation primarilyon the Nelson et al. (1943) study.NIOSH recommends limits for the hexane isomers of 100 ppm as a 10-hourTWA and 510 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. This recommendation isbased on human and animal evidence that exposure to n-hexane below concentrationsof 500 ppm is associated with the development of polyneuropathy (Inoueet al. 1970; Miyagaki 1967); NIOSH (1977a) did not distinguish betweenn-hexane and other hexane isomers when making its recommendation for anexposure limit. It should be noted that NIOSH concluded that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are potential neuropathic agents and cited a human study(Gaultier 1973) that reported neuropathy among workers exposed to an alkanemixture containing less than 5 percent n-hexane.The ACGIH (1986, p. 307) disagrees with NIOSH that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are potential neuropathic agents, citing evidence thata metabolite of n-hexane (2,5-hexanedione) is responsible for the uniqueneurotoxic properties of n-hexane (see discussion of n-hexane in SectionIV-C1 of this Preamble). The ACGIH concluded that ``it seems unlikely thatall the hexanes would follow the same metabolic route in the body [as n-hexane],in view of the marked variations in structure of the molecule'' (ACGIH1986, p. 307). After reviewing the evidence cited by ACGIH (1986) and NIOSH (1977a), OSHApreliminarily finds that workers exposed to hexane isomers are at significantrisk of experiencing narcosis and of developing neuropathy in the absenceof an OSHA limit. The NIOSH RELs for the hexane isomers (100 ppm TWA and510 ppm STEL) are based on the hypothesis that all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are potential neuropathic agents. OSHA tentatively acceptsthe analysis that a unique metabolite of n-hexane is responsible for sucheffects and therefore proposes at this time a 500-ppm TWA and a 1000-ppmSTEL for the hexane isomers. Because of the scientific disagreement onthis subject, OSHA specifically requests comments on the toxicity or absenceof toxicity of the other C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for hexane isomers. At the time of the final rule, OSHA willpromulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ISOAMYL ALCOHOL (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 123-51-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH_Primary; (CH<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHOH_Secondary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1218</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for the isoamyl alcohols is 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 100 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 125 ppm for these substances, which are colorless liquids thathave pungent tastes and an alcoholic odor that causes coughing.In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the primary isoamyl alcohol in 7.07 mg/kg (Smyth et al.1969). Haggard, Miller, and Greenburg (1945) determined that isoamyl alcohol'sanesthetic toxicity was approximately 12 times higher than that of ethylalcohol; these authors believed that exposure to isoamyl alcohol wouldnot cause chronic effects.Smyth (1956) reported that the principal effect of inhalation exposureto this substance is narcosis, and this author believed that, by analogywith the narcotic effects of butyl alcohol, a 100-ppm level would protectexposed workers against narcosis but not against irritation. Nelson, Ege,Ross and co-workers (1943) stated that unacclimatized human volunteersreported throat irritation at a concentration of 100 ppm, and eye and mucousmembrane irritation at higher levels.OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 125ppm for the isoamyl alcohols (primary and secondary). The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that these limits will work together to ensure that workers areprotected against the eye and mucous membrane irritation known to be associatedwith exposures above 100 ppm. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for isoamyl alcohol if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ISOPHORONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-59-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>14</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1221</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for isophorone is 25 pm as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIHhas established a 5 ppm TLV as a ceiling limit, and NIOSH recommends aworkplace standard of 4 ppm as a 10-hour TWA for isophorone. Isophoroneis a colorless liquid at room temperature, and it has a comphor-like order.Studies in animals and with human volunteers indicate that exposures tohigh concentrations of isophorone cause nephrotoxic and other adverse effects.A paper by Smyth, Seaton, and Fischer (1942) reported that guinea pigsand rats exposed to 550 ppm isophorone for 6 weeks demonstrated degenerativechanges in the kidneys and liver. At an exposure level of 25 ppm, no adverseeffects were noted, but at 50 ppm, the liver of one animal and the kidneysof four others were damaged. The entire group of 20 animals exposed at50 ppm survived, but 2 of 16 animals died after this level was raised to100 ppm (Smyth, Seaton, and Fischer 1942). Volunteers exposed for a fewminutes to isophorone vapor at concentrations between 40 and 400 ppm experiencedeye, nose, and throat irritation; several subjects exposed at the 200-ppmlevel developed headache, nausea, faintness, dizziness, and a feeling ofsuffocation (Smyth and Seaton 1940). Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946)reported that volunteers exposed to 25 ppm isophorone, the current OSHAPEL, complained of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Another studyconducted by the Western Electric Company (Ware, personal communication,1973) reported that workers exposed for a one-month period to levels of5 to 8 ppm isophorone demonstrated fatigue and malaise. When the workplacelevel was reduced to between 1 and 4 ppm, there were no complaints of adverseeffects. The NIOSH Criteria Document for the ketones (1978) notes thatall of the ketones are central nervous system depressants, and that workplaceexposures to more than one ketone may produce additive effects.OSHA is proposing to reduce the current 8-hour TWA PEL of 25 ppm to an8-hour TWA of 4 ppm, to protect workers against the risk of fatigue, nausea,and headaches demonstrated to occur in exposed workers at levels between5 and 8 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce this occupational risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for isophorone if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-87-3; CHEMICAL FORMULA: CH<T2>3</T2>C1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1254</ITAG>OSHA's current limits for methyl chloride are 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,200 ppm as a 15-minute ceiling, and 300 ppm as a 5-minute peak in any 3-hourperiod. The ACGIH has established a 50-ppm 8-hour TLV-TWA limit and a 100-ppm15-minute STEL for this substance. NIOSH recommends the lowest feasiblelimit for methyl chloride and considers it a carcinogen. Methyl chlorideis a colorless, sweet-smelling gas. There is considerable evidence in humans and some in animals demonstratingthat exposure to methyl chloride by inhalation or dermal absorption producesnarcosis and other central nervous system effects, including respiratoryfailure and death (ACGIH 1986, p. 380). In animals, repeated exposuresto 500 ppm or to higher concentrations can be life-threatening, but exposuresto 300 ppm for 64 weeks caused no apparent effects (Smith and von Oettingen1947).Reports in the earlier literature described by Fairhall (1969) indicatethat moderate (not further specified) exposure causes ocular symptoms thatmay persist for weeks, while serious (not further specified) exposure hassevere effects in the central nervous system. Patty (1963) states thatserious exposure causes central nervous system, liver and kidney, and bonemarrow effects, with symptoms of ataxia, staggering gait, weakness, tremors,vertigo, speaking difficulty, and blurred vision. Symptoms may be of severalweeks' duration or may even be permanent (Patty 1963). The Dow Chemical Company (as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 380) studied the methylchloride exposures of employees in 54 job classifications over a 4-monthperiod. Exposures ranged from 5 to 78 ppm methyl chloride (8-hour TWA),averaged 30 ppm over the work shift, and occasionally included peaks ashigh as 440 ppm. Medical examination of these workers revealed no detectableeffects of methyl chloride exposure. However, average 8-hour exposuresin the range of 195 to 475 ppm caused symptoms of weakness, drowsiness,staggering gait, thickness of the tongue, and memory lapses in some ofthe employees (Dow Chemical Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 380).In a study of six cases of industrial methyl chloride poisoning, workerschronically exposed to levels between 200 and 400 ppm developed neurotoxicsymptoms after 2 or more weeks of exposure (Scharen-Weber, Spears, Cowles1974). Symptoms included drowsiness, dizziness, mental confusion, mistyvision, staggering gait, and slurred speech, and symptoms sometimes recurredafter apparent recovery and in the absence of renewed exposure. Repko and co-workers (1976) found that workers exposed to concentrationsof methyl chloride ranging from 7.4 to 70 ppm but averaging 33.6 ppm displayeda significant performance decrement, and that exposures below 100 ppm producedsignificant but transitory changes in functional capacity. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 100 ppmfor methyl chloride. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these twolimits together will protect workers from the risk of neurotoxic effects,including functional impairment, performance decrements, headaches, dizziness,slurred speech, and staggering gait associated with exposure to this substanceat the levels permitted by OSHA's current PEL. The Agency believes thatthe proposed PEL and STEL will work together to reduce this risk substantially.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limitfor methyl chloride if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYL CHLOROFORM (1,1,1-TRICHLOROETHANE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 71-55-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CC1<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1255</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 350 ppm for methyl chloroform.The ACGIH has established the same TWA limit as well as a TLV-STEL of 450ppm. NIOSH recommends a 15-minute ceiling limit of 350 ppm. Methyl chloroformis a clear, nonflammable liquid. The primary health concerns associated with exposure to methyl chloroformare anesthesia and cardiac sensitization. The oral toxicity of methyl chloroformis low, with LD<T2>50</T2> values ranging from 5.7 to 12.3 g/kg for rats, mice, rabbits,and guinea pigs. This substance does, however, defat the skin on contactcausing redness and scaling (Torkelson et al. 1958). Skin absorption isrelatively insignificant; the acute percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is greater than 16 g/kg; slight, reversible irritationwas observed from applications of 0.5 g/kg to rabbit skin for 90 days (Torkelsonet al. 1958). Repeated expsoure of animals to concentrations between 1000and 10,000 ppm for 3 months produced anesthesia and lung and liver damagein some species, but exposure to 500 ppm of methyl chloroform vapor for7 hours daily, 5 days/week for 6 months caused no toxic changes in guineapigs, rabbits, or monkeys (Torkelson et al. 1958). Other animal studies(Gehring 1968; Plaa, Evans, and Hine 1958; Rowe et al. 1963) have reportedthat methyl chloroform has low hepatotoxicity, but cardiac sensitizationhas occurred at high doses (5000-10,000 ppm) (Rennick et al. 1949; Trochimowiczet al. 1976). Tests in rats and mice for teratogenicity and carcinogenicityhave demonstrated negative results (Schwetz et al. 1975; NIOSH 1976; Weisberger1977).In humans, it has been reported that anesthetic effects may begin to occurat methyl chloroform concentrations approaching 500 ppm (Stewart et al.1969). Deaths from anesthesia and/or cardiac sensitization have been notedin employees working in confined areas (Patty 1963). Kramer and co-workers(1978) conducted an epidemiological study of men and women exposed forperiods ranging from several months to 6 years to methyl chloroform atlevels that occasionally exceeded 200 ppm; when compared to matched-paircontrols, no adverse exposure-related effects were found (Kramer, Ott,Fulerson et al. 1978).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 350 ppm TWA and a STEL of 450 ppm for methylchloroform The Agency preiminarily concludes that this combined PEL-STELlimit will protect workers against the risk of anesthetic and cardiac-sensitizingeffects potentially associated with exposure at the elevated short-termlevels permitted by an 8-hour limit alone. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.

The ACGIHhas established a 300-ppm TWA and a 375-ppm STEL NIOSH (1977a) recommendsa 75-ppm 10 hour TWA and a 385-ppm 15-minute ceiling limit.Mice exposed to octane concentrations of 6600 to 13,700 ppm developed narcosisin 30 to 90 minutes (Fuhner 1921). Flury and Zernik (1931) believed thenarcotic concentration in humans to be 5000 ppm; Patty and Yant (1929)placed the narcotic concentration at 8000 ppm. Based on this information,the ACGIH concluded that octane was 1.2 to 2 times more toxic than heptane,and recommended TLVs of 300 ppm TWA and 375 ppm STEL.  As discussed in more detail above for the other C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes, the NIOSH (1977a) recommended limits are based on theirfinding that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes present a neurotoxic hazard similar to n-hexane. TheACGIH disagrees with this conclusion, believing the neurotoxic propertiesof n-hexane to be unique among the alkane series.  Because octane is known to be more toxic than heptane, OSHA believes alower limit is warranted to protect against the risk of narcosis. At thistime, OSHA is proposing to revise its limits for octane to 300 ppm TWAand 375 ppm STEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for octane if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk. OSHA also requests comment on the strength ofthe evidence that exposure to octane may present a more serious neuropathichazard.<ITAG tagnum="26">PENTANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-66-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>12</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1306</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for pentane is 1000 ppm TWA. In 1976, the ACGIH adopteda 600-ppm TLV-TWA and a 750-ppm TLV-STEL. NIOSH (1977a) has recommendedthat workplace exposures to pentane not exceed 120 ppm as a 10-hour TWAand 610 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. Pentane is usually encounteredin volatile petroleum fractions, some of which are used as solvents. Purepentane is used as a blowing agent for plastics, in solvent extraction,and in ice manufacture.  Fairhall (1957) stated that narcosis and mucous membrane irritation werethe only reported toxic effects resulting from exposure to pentane. Thereported lethal concentration in humans is 130,000 ppm. (Flury and Zernik1931; Swann et al. 1974). According to Patty and Yant (1929), humans exposedfor 10 minutes to 5000 ppm did not complain of any adverse symptoms.  In a report by Gaultier et al. (1973), five cases of polyneuropathy occurredamong employees exposed to a solvent containing 80 percent pentane, 14percent heptane, and 5 percent hexane. Based largely on this report, NIOSH(1977a) recommended the same occupational limit for all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes as for the neuropathic agent n-hexane (350-mg/m3 TWAand 1800-mg/m3 15-minute short-term limits; these limits are equal to about120-ppm TWA and 610-ppm 15-minute short-term limits for pentane).  The ACGIH (1986) points out that the rationale used by NIOSH in settinga limit for pentane ignores the theory that n-hexane is uniquely neuropathicvia metabolism to 2,5-hexanedione, which is the same metabolite that isformed during exposure to another neuropathic agent, methyl butyl ketone.The ACGIH (1986) established its limits of 600 ppm TWA and 750 ppm as aSTEL to ``provide a substantial margin of safety against narcotic and irritativeeffects,'' but did not rule out the possibility that ``chronic exposureto high concentrations may lead to neuropathy'' (ACGIH 1986). The ACGIHbelieved that the manifestation of such effects would require heavy exposuresto pentane and concluded that its recommended limits would be adequatelyprotective. At this time, OSHA accepts the evaluation that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are not equally toxic because a metabolite of n-hexaneexhibits unique neurotoxic properties. The Gaultier study does not providespecific isomer exposure data supporting the RELs of 120 ppm (TWA) and610 ppm (STEL). The Agency therefore proposes a TWA of 600 ppm and a STELof 750 ppm as the permissible exposure limits for pentane. Because of thedisagreement regarding the subject of equal C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkane toxicity, OSHA is specifically requesting comments onthis scientific question.<ITAG tagnum="26">2-PENTANONE (METHYL PROPYL KETONE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-87-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>7</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1307</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for 2-pentanone is 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. ACGIHrecommends a 200-ppm TLV-TWA and a 250-ppm TLV-STEL. NIOSH (1978g) hasrecommended a 150-ppm limit as a 10-hour TWA.  Both the ACGIH- and NIOSH-recommended limits are based on a study by Spechtet al. (1940), who found that guinea pigs exhibited irritation and weaknesson exposure to 2500 ppm, and that exposure to 5000 ppm produced narcosisand coma. The authors concluded that 2-pentanone was considerably lesstoxic than methyl butyl ketone but is more toxic than methyl ethyl ketone,and is likely to be more irritating than methyl ethyl ketone or acetone.The ACGIH-recommended limits are apparently based on a judgment that the200-ppm TLV-TWA and 250-ppm TLV-STEL are low enough to prevent narcosisand irritation. NIOSH (1978) applied the findings of Specht et al. (1940) to the findingsof Nelson et al. (1943), who reported that volunteers complained of slightirritation on exposure to 100 ppm methyl ethyl ketone. Because 2-pentanonewas believed by Specht et al. (1940) to be at least as irritating as methylethyl ketone, NIOSH (1978) believed that a ``slight reduction'' in theOSHA standard was warranted. Therefore, NIOSH recommended a 150-ppm limitfor 2-pentanone.Both the ACGIH and NIOSH limits are designed to reduce the acute healtheffects observed at 100 ppm. While the 150-ppm REL appears to be more protective,OSHA has preliminarily concluded that the combination of a 200-ppm TWAand a 250-ppm STEL is more protective and is necessary to prevent the adversehealth effects associated with exposure to this chemical. OSHA thereforeproposes these limits for adoption as the PEL to reduce the risks associatedwith exposures at elevated short-term levels. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for 2-pentanone if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PERCHLOROETHYLENE (TETRACHLOROETHYLENE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 127-18-4; Chemical Formula: CC1<T2>2</T2>=CC1<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TWAof 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 200 ppm for perchloroethylene. NIOSHrecommends maintaining exposures at the lowest feasible limit and classifiesthis chemical as a carcinogen. Perchloroethylene is a clear, colorlessliquid with an ether-like odor.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for mice is 8.85 mg/kg, and the lethal air concentration forthis species is 6000 ppm for 4 hours (Handbook of Toxicology 1956). Ratswere exposed 8 hours/day, 5 days/week for as long as 17 months to 70, 230,or 470 ppm (Carpenter 1937). At 70 ppm, all animals survived and no pathologywas noted. Animals also survived the higher exposures, but changes wereseen at postmortem in the kidneys and livers of these rats. Rats, guineapigs, cats, rabbits, and monkeys were exposed to varying concentrationsof perchloroethylene for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for various durations(Rowe et al. 1952). Rats exposed at 1600 ppm developed drowsiness and depressionafter 1 week and liver and kidney changes after 4 weeks. Guinea pigs exposedto 400 ppm for 130 exposures developed heavier kidneys and livers and fattydegeneration of the liver. Rats, rabbits, and monkeys exposed for 130 7-hourexposures to 400 ppm showed no effects.Mice exposed in another study to 200 ppm 4 hours/day for 1, 2, 4, or 8weeks developed fatty degeneration of the liver (Kylin, Sumegi, and Yllner1965). Exposure of pregnant rats to 300 ppm perchloroethylene on days 6through 15 of gestation did not cause teratological effects but did producedevelopmental toxicity (Schuetz, Leong, and Gerhing 1975). This substancedoes not appear to be mutagenic (ACGIH 1986, p. 464).In an NCI gavage study for carcinogenicity, perchloroethylene proved carcinogenicto the livers of mice but not to those of rats (NCI 1977). Applicationof perchloroethylene to the skin of rats and mice, with and without a promoter,did not induce cancer (Thiess et al. 1977).In humans being treated for worms, perchloroethylene doses of 2.8 or 4ml caused narcosis, exhilaration, and signs of inebriation; at doses of1 to 8 ml, no changes were seen in liver function tests (Lambert 1933;Fernando et al. 1939). A worker exposed to an estimated concentration of1470 ppm perchloroethylene and Stoddard solvent for 3.5 hours lost consciousness(Stewart et al. 1961). Studies have shown that exposure to perchloroethyleneat 2000 ppm for 1.5 minutes caused unconsciousness; exposure at 500 ppmfor 50 minutes caused increased salivation, metallic taste, eye irritation,and other effects; exposure at 216 ppm for 2 hours caused eye burning,light-headedness, motor incoordination, and other effects (Carpenter 1973).A 4-hour exposure to 100 ppm caused eye irritation (Stewart et al. 1974).Chronic exposure to 200 ppm perchloroethylene caused early signs of centralnervous system depression, but exposure to 100 ppm on a regular basis apparentlyhad no adverse effect (Stewart et al. 1974, 1977). Direct contact withthe liquid causes erythema, skin burns, and dermal absorption (Morgan 1969;Gold 1969; Stewart and Dodd 1964).Two epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed perchloroethyleneworkers have failed to show increases in the incidence of liver tumorsamong these workers (Blair, Decoufle, and Grauman 1979; Kaplan 1980, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 464).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 200 ppmfor perchloroethylene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits,taken together, will protect workers against the risk of eye irritation,headaches, and other effects associated with exposure to perchloroethylene.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limitfor perchloroethylene if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">STODDARD SOLVENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8052-41-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>20</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1371</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for stoddard solvent is 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm. NIOSH (1977h) recommendslimits of 350 mg/m\3\ as a 10-hour TWA and 1800 mg/m\3\ as a 15-minuteceiling for all refined petroleum solvents; these limits correspond approximatelyto a 60 ppm TWA and 310 ppm STEL, respectively. Stoddard solvent is a refinedpetroleum solvent having a flash point in the range of 102 to 100 anddegrees;Fand containing 65 percent or more C<T2>10</T2> and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons.The current OSHA limit of 500 ppm (equivalent to the 1968 ACGIH TLV) wasbased on the toxicities of the major components of stoddard solvent (i.e.,80 to 85 percent nonane and isodecane and 15 to 20 percent trimethyl benezene);specifically, the recommended limit was calculated from the TLVs establishedfor pentane and trimethyl benzene. The revised ACGIH limit of 100 ppm thusreflects a reduction in the TLVs for pentane and trimethyl benzene. TheACGIH (1986) noted that a report by Carpenter et al. (1978), who foundslight kidney damage among rats exposed to 330 ppm for 65 days, providedadditional evidence that the earlier limit was too high.The NIOSH limit of 350 mg/m\3\ TWA and 1800 mg/m\3\ is derived from itsrecommended limits for C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes, which are designed to protect against neuropathic effects.NIOSH recommended the same limit for stoddard solvent because of the lackof data on chronic effects and because of a report of polyneuropathy occurringamong workers exposed to jet fuels containing mixtures of kerosene andgasoline. NIOSH reasoned that although C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes present in jet fuel may have been responsible, it waspossible that the heavier hydrocarbon components may also have been responsible.Thus, the recommended limits for stoddard solvent reflect a concern thathigher molecular weight hydrocarbons may be neuropathic.The NIOSH RELs for stoddard solvent are based on the hypothesis of equivalentneuropathic toxicity for all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes. OSHA has tentatively rejected this approach. OSHA thereforeproposes that the 100 ppm TWA be adopted as the new PEL to reduce the risk;this limit is based on information developed for analogous solvents. TheAgency requests comments on this issue, as discussed above.<ITAG tagnum="26">TOLUENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-88-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1397</ITAG>The current OSHA standard for toluene is 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA limit,with a 300 ppm ceiling and a 500 ppm peak for a maximum of 10 minutes in8 hours. The ACGIH has established an exposure limit for toluene at 100ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH recommendsa 100 ppm 8-hour TWA and a 10-minute ceiling of 200 ppm. Toluene is a flammable,colorless liquid with an aromatic hydrocarbon odor.The acute toxicity of toluene in animals is greater than that of benzene.Patty (1963) reports that the lethal doses of toluene and benzene in miceare 10,000 and 14,000 ppm, respectively. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 7.53 ml/kg (Smyth et al. 1969). Exposure of ratsto 2500 or 5000 ppm of toluene caused a temporary decrease in white cellcount but no evidence of damage to the blood-forming organs or the liver.Fairhall (1957) stated that severe toluene exposure can cause a markeddrop in the red blood cell count and partial destruction of the blood-formingelements of the bone marrow, but other researchers report that numerousanimal studies indicate that toluene is not a bone marrow toxin (Gerarde1960). A study by Greenberg, Mayers, Heinmann, and Moskowitz (1942) reportedthat painters exposed to toluene levels of 100 to 1100 ppm exhibited enlargedlivers, a moderate decrease in red blood cell counts, enlarged red bloodcells, and absolute lymphocytosis, but no leukopenia. Wilson (1943) observedworkers exposed to toluene at varying levels up to 1500 ppm. At levelsless than 200 ppm, signs of headache, fatigue, and nausea were present.Those workers exposed to 200 to 500 ppm toluene experienced temporary amnesia,lack of coordination, and anorexia. Levels of exposure from 500 to 1500ppm resulted in a marked loss of coordination, diminished reaction time,pronounced weakness, and heart palpitations. Red cell counts were alsodecreased, and two cases of aplastic anemia required lengthy hospital treatment;however, the author noted that he could not rule out the possibility thatbenzene contamination of the toluene was the cause of these effects. Incidencesof aplastic anemia (one fatal) have been noted in six glue sniffers; toluenewas the base solvent in the glue (Powers 1965). A man who had inhaled tolueneregularly at unspecified levels for 14 years developed permanent encephalopathy(Knox and Nelson 1966). Von Oettingen, Neal, Donahue, et al. (1942) foundthat exposures of 200 ppm for an unspecified duration caused slight changesin muscle coordination in human volunteers. Later studies by Ogata, Tomokuniand Takatsuka (1970) showed an increase in reaction time, and a decreasein pulse rate, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure at exposures to200 ppm for 7 hours.OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppm and a STEL of 150 ppm fortoluene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that studies clearly indicatethat a risk of hepatotoxicity, hematopoietic, and nervous system effectsexists at levels substantially below the current 200-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL.OSHA believes that the new limits will protect exposed workers from therisk of these serious health effects, which have been demonstrated to occureven as a result of less than full-shift exposures.<ITAG tagnum="26">TRICHLOROETHYLENE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-01-6; Chemical Formula: CCL<T2>2</T2>=CHC1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1406</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for trichloroethylene, adopted from ANSI, is 100 ppmTWA, 200 ppm as a ceiling not to be exceeded for more than 5 minutes every2 hours, and 300 ppm as a peak limit. The ACGIH has recommended a 50-ppmTLV-TWA and a 200-ppm TLV-STEL. NIOSH (1978h) considers trichloroethyleneto be a potential human carcinogen and has recommended a 25-pm 10-hourTWA.The ACGIH (1986) cited several studies establishing that trichloroethyleneprimarily affects the central nervous system and liver; some of these studieshave indicated that chronic exposure to less than 100 ppm trichloroethyleneis associated with a variety of nervous disturbances. Haas (1960) and Grandjean(1955) reported nervous symptoms among workers exposed for 5 years or moreto concentrations ranging from 1 to 335 ppm; the frequency of complaintsincreased when average exposures exceeded 40 ppm. Bardodej and Vyskocil(1956) also reported symptoms of trichloroethylene poisoning, includingtremors, giddiness, anxiety, and alcohol intolerance, among workers exposedabove 40 ppm. In contrast, controlled laboratory experiments with humansubjects exposed for up to several days to 100 or 200 ppm have generallyreported no behavioral or subjective responses. The ACGIH concluded thatalthough the symptoms reported by workers are subjective and commonly foundamong individuals with no chemical exposure, the consistency of the reports``suggests the possibility of some subjective complaints as concentrationsexceed about 50 ppm'' (ACGIH 1986). Therefore, the ACGIH recommended aTLV-TWA of 50 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 200 ppm to minimize complaints of headache,fatigue, and irritability.The ACGIH (1986) also reviewed some of the carcinogenicity data on trichloroethylene.In an NCI bioassay (1976b), mice given trichloroethylene by gavage developedhepatocellular carcinomas, but rats did not. The species difference inresponse was attributed to a difference in the way trichloroethylene ismetabolized between the mouse and rat (Stott et al. 1982). An inhalationstudy on mice, rats, and Syrian hamsters (Henschler et al. 1980) foundonly an increase in the occurrence of malignant lymphomas in mice, whichthe authors believed were peculiar to the strain of mouse used (NMRI).The ACGIH also cited a number of epidemiologic investigations of cohortsas large as 7,688 workers, in which no correlation between cancer mortalityand exposure to trichloroethylene was found (Novotna et al. 1971; Axelsonet al. 1978; Tola et al. 1980).After reviewing some of the same data, NIOSH (1978h) concluded that theresults of the NCI gavage study indicate trichloroethylene (TCE) to bea potential human carcinogen, although it was ``not considered to be apotent carcinogen.'' In addition, NIOSH concluded that the current 100ppm limit would not sufficiently protect against neuropathic symptoms causedby exposure to trichloroethylene. NIOSH's recommended limit of 25 ppm wasbased on an evaluation of several industrial hygiene reports showing thatmany degreasing operations, including those using open-top tanks, are maintainingexposures at less than 50 ppm TWA. NIOSH believed that a 25-ppm TWA levelcould be uniformly achieved by the use of engineering control technology.Since publication of the 1978 NIOSH report, several recent bioassays ontrichloroethylene have been published and are currently being reviewedby EPA. Fukuda et al. (1983) exposed female rats and mice to 50, 150, or450 ppm trichloroethylene for 103 weeks and reported an increase incidenceof lung tumors among mice only. Maltoni et al. (1986) exposed rats andmice to 100, 300, or 600 ppm trichloroethylene and reported a significantincrease of renal adenocarcinomas and Leydig cell tumors in rats, and asignfiant increase in hepatomas and lung tumors in mice. In 1986, the NIPreported an increase in the incidence of kidney tumors in rats given trichloroethyleneby gavage; however, the NTP considered the response to be weak (3 of 49animals) and reported that the results were only statistically significantafter corrections for high mortality were made.The 50-ppm TWA and 200-ppm STEL established by the ACGIH were establishedto minimize subjective complaints of headache, fatigue, and irritability.However, NIOSH has concluded that TCE is a potential human carcinogen,although not a ``potent'' one. NIOSH recommended a REL of 25 ppm TWA becausethe current PEL does not sufficiently protect against nervous system effects.NIOSH believes this REL is feasible and can be achieved by engineeringcontrol technology. In light of the uncertainty of the carcinogenicityissue, OSHA proposes adoption of a 25-ppm TWA REL to substantially reduceoccupational risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for trichloroethylene if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.Preliminary ConclusionsOSHA preliminarily concludes that workers exposed to these narcosis-causingsubstances are at risk of loss of consciousness, uncoordinated movements,inability to concentrate, and drowsiness; these highly undesirable andserious health effects may additionally have the potential to cause seriousworkplace accidents and injuries. The new or reduced exposure limits beingproposed by OSHA are intended to protect employees from experiencing theserisks in their places of work and will create a substantial reduction insuch risks. The health evidence for these substances forms a reasonablebasis for proposing the revision or addition of limits at the proposedlevels. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish limits for thesenarcotic substances if the Agency determines that these limits will reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofSensory Irritation</ITAG>IntroductionExposure to many chemical agents is associated with the development ofsensory irritation, which is initiated when these substances come intocontact with mucous membranes or skin. Limits have been set for a largegroup of chemicals on the basis of their sensory irritant effects. Thesesubstances, which number 79, are shown in Table C3-1, along with theircurrent OSHA limits, CAS numbers, NIOSH RELs, ACGIH TLVs, and OSHA HS numbers.For six of these chemicals, OSHA is proposing to reduce the 8-hour TWA,and for an additional nine, the Agency proposes both to reduce the 8-hourlimit and to add a STEL. In 22 cases, the 8-hour limit would remain unchangedbut a STEL would be added. In six instances, a ceiling is proposed fordeletion, and this limit would be replaced by an 8-hour TWA and/or STELlimits. Thirty of these chemicals were previously unregulated by OSHA,and for these, OSHA is proposing 8-hour limits, 8-hour limits supplementedby a STEL, or ceiling limits. For five substances, OSHA is proposing toreplace an existing TWA limit with a ceiling limit. For 15 of these substances,the NIOSH and ACGIH limits are different (see Table C3-1). OSHA is proposingthe NIOSH REL for three substances.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M009</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustrations 197-205</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsIrritant effects are readily perceived by affected individuals. The symptomsof sensory irritation include stinging, itching, and burning of the eyes,tearing (or lacrimation), a burning sensation in the nasal passages, rhinitis(nasal inflammation), cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing, anddyspnea (breathing difficulty). In the majority of cases, the onset ofsymptoms occurs rapidly upon exposure to the irritant; it is thereforeeasy to associate the causative agent with the irritant effect.These effects cause severe discomfort and may be seriously disabling, asis the case with dyspnea or wheezing. The tearing and eye irritation associatedwith exposure to sensory irritants is often severe and can be as disablingas the weeping caused by exposure to tear gas. In addition to these primaryeffects, workers distracted by irritant effects are considerably more likelythan non-exposed workers to have accidents and thus to endanger both themselvesand others. (These adverse health effects also clearly have substantialproductivity impacts.)The eye irritation caused by exposure to irritants is believed to resultfrom stimulation of the sensory nerve endings in the cornea. There is littleinformation available on the relationship between the severity of the effectand the physical or chemical properties of the irritating substance. Inaddition, the mechanism of action underlying this irritant effect is notwell understood. Mechanisms that have been suggested include physical actionof the irritant on nerve endings, binding of the irritant to sulfhydrylgroups of protein, inhibition of cellular respiration, and cholinesteraseinhibition (Grant 1986). The symptoms of eye irritation are usually transientand do not generally persist after cessation of exposure; however, exposureto concentrations of lacrimators that exceed the levels associated withtransient eye irritation may produce corneal or conjunctival injury thatrequires medical treatment (Grant 1986).Sensory irritation of the pulmonary system primarily affects the upperrespiratory tract and causes an increase in sputum production; inflammationof the nasal passages, trachea, and upper bronchial tree; and decreasedcilial clearance. These effects produce a burning sensation in the nasalpassages and throat; coughing; sneezing; and acute bronchitis. The developmentof bronchitis indicates that the cilial clearance mechanism has been compromised,and the resulting mucus retention increases the risk of secondary bacterialinfection. Wheezing may also be apparent, particularly if the affectedindividual has a history of hyper-reactive airways disease. If exposureis sufficiently intense, the irritant may reach the lower portion of thebronchial tree, causing a chemical burn of the parenchyma and the suddencollection of fluid in interstitial spaces and alveoli (pulmonary edema).Irritation-induced edema may have a delayed onset (12 hours or more) andcan cause hypoxia and difficulty in breathing.For the great majority of substances in this group, current limits arederived from human evidence that exposure to the chemical agent at a particularairborne concentration will be associated with sensory irritation. Fora few substances in this group, animal evidence provided the basis forlimit setting. Several general types of evidence may be used to lower existinglimits:andbullet; Consideration of new human evidence;andbullet; Reinterpretation of human data that formed the basis for settingthe 1968 TLV;andbullet; Consideration of evidence from industrial experience showing thatemployees are not experiencing irritation; andandbullet; Evaluation of new animal evidence.The studies that provide the basis for the sensory irritant levels beingproposed by OSHA are generally controlled-exposure experiments using humanvolunteers or reports of employee complaints arising in industrial settings.Almost all of these studies report either a NOE level for irritation (describedeither as the ``complaint level'' or the level that can be ``tolerated''for 8 hours) or an exposure level below which there have been no reportedcomplaints.Dose-Response Relationships and Sensory IrritationThe onset of sensory irritation is considered a ``threshold'' or NOE level;that is, for any sensory irritant, there is an exposure level below whichvery few if any individuals will experience sensory irritation. As exposureincreases above this level, a larger proportion of exposed individualswill notice the effect and the effect will become increasingly severe.At some level above this NOEL, all exposed persons will experience sensoryirritation, although the intensity of the response may vary.The risk of experiencing irritation that is associated with exposures belowthe NOEL will be minimal (except in the hypersensitive individual), whilethe risk of experiencing the irritant effect will increase directly asexposure increases. At some point above the NOE level, i.e., at some doseof the substance, the response will be 100 percent, and all exposed personswill experience irritation. According to general toxicologic principles,the shape of the curve that describes responses above the NOEL is sigmoidal,and the steepness of the curve is a function of the variability in individualresponses to the particular irritant. For example, if nearly all personsexposed to the substance will experience a response at approximately thesame concentration (dose), the curve will be steep; if, on the other hand,the percentage of people responding increases only slowly as concentrationrises, the curve will be considerably flatter.Analyses of the toxicologic data for the the substances in this group ofchemicals follow. The following paragraphs describe OSHA's preliminaryfindings for the substances in this group of sensory irritants.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACETALDEHYDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-07-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1001</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for acetaldehyde is 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The 200-ppm1968 TLV established by the ACGIH for acetaldehyde was based on a sensoryirritation study conducted by Silverman et al. (1946) that showed thatunacclimatized individuals experienced eye irritation at 50 ppm, but thata level of 200 ppm was tolerable for an 8-hour day. The ACGIH has subsequentlylowered its limit for acetaldehyde to 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and supplementedthis with a STEL of 150 ppm. NIOSH has no REL for this substance.Reexamination of the data reported by Silverman et al. (1946) reveals that,at 200 ppm of acetaldehyde, all exposed persons experienced inflammationof the conjunctivae of the eyes, which manifested as redness. OSHA thereforepreliminarily concludes that the current PEL of 200 ppm places exposedemployees at risk of conjunctivitis and other irritation and that a reductionto 100 ppm is necessary to reduce this risk. OSHA also finds that a STELis necessary to supplement the 8-hour limit, because without a STEL, workerscould be exposed at levels many times those that have been shown to causecorneal injury, sensitization, and respiratory tract irritation. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for acetaldehydeif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACETIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 64-19-17; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1002</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for acetic acid is a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 15 ppm. Acetic acid isa clear, colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent odor.The 10-ppm TWA was established on the basis of work indicating that industrialexposure to acetic acid at 10 ppm was non-irritating (Sterner 1943). Patty(1949) reported that exposures to 800 to 1200 ppm cannot be tolerated byhumans for longer than three minutes. One of six rats exposed to 16,000ppm died (Smyth 1956), and guinea pigs exhibited minor changes in respirationafter exposure at 5 ppm, with more pronounced effects at 100 ppm (Amdur1961).In humans, conjunctival irritation has been reported for exposures below10 ppm (duration not specified) (Baldi 1963), and workers exposed to concentrationsof 60 ppm during the workshift, plus one hour daily at 100 to 260 ppm,for 7 to 12 years developed respiratory irritation, conjunctivitis, bronchitis,pharyngitis, and erosion of exposed teeth (Parmeggiani and Sassi 1954).Vigliana and Zurlo (1956) observed respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skinirritation in the same group of workers.To protect against these irritant effects, which were associated with short-termexposures, OSHA is proposing to supplement the existing 10-ppm 8-hour TWAwith a STEL of 15 ppm.The Agency preliminarily concludes that the combined TWA-STEL is necessaryto protect exposed workers against the risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal,and skin irritation associated with industrial exposures to acetic acid.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limitfor acetic acid if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACETONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-64-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1004</ITAG>OSHA's current Z table limit for acetone is 1000 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH recommends a 750-ppm TLV and a 1000-ppm STEL for this substance,while the NIOSH REL is 250 ppm TWA.The 1000-ppm limit for acetone was established primarily on the basis ofinformation that indicated that workers experienced irritation at exposurelevels ranging from 2500 to 3000 ppm (Oglesby et al. 1949). The 1000-ppmTLV represented the hygienic standard observed in the 1960s and earlierfor that group of vapors considered by industrial hygienists to be relativelyharmless. In the interval since the adoption of the 1968 TLVs by OSHA,additional information has been developed that shows that exposure to 1000ppm of acetone causes sensory irritation in some workers. The ACGIH (1986)reports that a study by Vigliani and Zurlo (1955) found that acetone productionworkers exposed at the 700-ppm level for 3 hours daily for 7 to 15 yearsexperienced inflammation of the respiratory tract, stomach, and duodenum,giddiness, and loss of strength; some of these effects go beyond irritationeffects. In another study reported on by the ACGIH, 10 men exposed to variousacetone concentrations for 3 to 5 minutes found a level of 200 ppm satisfactoryand experienced ``slight'' irritation at 300 ppm, but could still ``tolerate''exposure at 500 ppm (Nelson et al. 1943). The ACGIH concluded that a TLVof 750 ppm was appropriate because Nelson's results were based on ``extremelyshort, 3 to 5 minute, exposures,'' while DiVincenzo's findings demonstrated``no effects from acetone at 500 ppm except an awareness of odor'' (ACGIH1986).In recommending a 250-ppm 10-hour TWA limit, NIOSH relied on the Nelsonet al. (1943) study, as well as a controlled human exposure study (Matsushita1969) showing that subjects exposed to 500 ppm for 6 hours experiencedmucosal irritation as well as general weakness the following day. Anotherstudy cited by NIOSH (Parmeggiani and Sassi 1954) indicated that employeesexposed to acetone in the range of 307 to 918 ppm experienced mucosal irritationand CNS disturbances. NIOSH (1978j) concluded that adverse effects willoccur upon exposure to acetone concentrations below 500 ppm, and thereforerecommended a 250-ppm TWA limit.OSHA preliminarily concludes that the 750-ppm TLV does not protect againstdeleterious health effects observed at 700 ppm, 500 ppm, and 300 ppm andthat a 250-ppm 8-hour TWA limit is necessary to provide adequate protectionagainst the risk of acetone-induced irritation at these levels. Feasibilityis indicated by the fact that more than 95 percent of a very large numberof air samples reported in the IMIS data base reveal exposures below 250ppm. OSHA therefore proposes that the 250-ppm REL be adopted as the OSHAPEL to reduce the risk of irritation for exposed individuals. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for acetoneif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACROLEIN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-02-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCHO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Acrolein is a colorless or yellowishflammable liquid with a disagreeable, choking odor.In early inhalation studies of cats (Iwanoff 1911), exposure to 10 ppmacrolein for 3.5 hours was found to have only transient effects, includingsalivation, lacrimation, respiratory irritation, and mild narcosis. However,later studies reported that an exposure to 1 ppm of acrolein produced markednose and eye irritation in 5 minutes or less (Cook 1945). Over longer periods,studies have demonstrated fatalities in 1 of 6 rats exposed for 4 hoursto airborne concentrations of acrolein at 8 ppm; at 16 ppm, the mortalitywas 100 percent (Smyth 1956). Irritation of the upper respiratory tractis the primary symptom of acrolein inhalation, but lung edema can occurafter exposure to high concentrations (Henderson and Haggard 1943). Inaddition, skin contact with acrolein causes skin burns and severe injuryto the cornea.OSHA is proposing 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average and a 15-minuteshort-term limit of 0.3 ppm to provide the necessary protection againstthe acutely irritating effects of short-term exposure to acrolein. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that the combined TWA-STEL being proposedwill reduce the risk of severe irritation, skin burns, and corneal damageto which workers could be exposed with an 8-hour TWA alone. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for acroleinif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALLYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-18-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1010</ITAG>OSHA has a current PEL of 2 ppm TWA for allyl alcohol with a skin notation.The ACGIH also has a TLV-TWA of 2 ppm, supplemented by a STEL of 4 ppmand a skin notation. Allyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a pungent,mustard-like odor.The most important adverse effects of occupational exposures to allyl alcoholare upper-respiratory-tract irritation and burns of the eyes. Severe eyeirritation has been reported in humans at exposure levels of 25 ppm, andmilder irritation has been reported at 5 ppm (Dunlap, Kodarma, Wellingtonet al. 1958; McCord 1932). Necrosis of the cornea and temporary blindnessoccurred in one individual exposed to allyl alcohol at a level irritatingto the eyes and nose (Smyth 1956). Skin absorption may lead to serioussystemic injury (visceral congestion, periportal congestion of the liver,hematuria, and nephritis); when evaporation is prevented or reduced, skincontact causes burns (ACGIH 1986, p. 18).Exposure to airborne concentrations of allyl alcohol causes a series ofcharacteristic effects, including lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision,and retrobulbar pain (Dunlap, Kodarma, Wellington et al. 1958). Exposedindividuals do not develop a tolerance for this substance, and they alsodo not become sensitized (Kodama and Hine 1958).OSHA proposes a short-term limit of 4 ppm (15 minutes) and an 8-hour TWAPEL of 2 ppm to provide protection against the risk associated with severeeye irritation resulting from exposure to allyl alcohol. This short-termlimit ensures that workers will be protected against the health effectsassociated with exposures at levels only somewhat above the current 8-hourTWA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing arevision to this level.

NIOSH has recommended a15-minute ceiling of 9.6 ppm for this colorless liquid, which has a characteristic,but not unpleasant, odor.In limited human exposure studies, AGE has been demonstrated to cause dermatitisand eye irritation; the substance produces moderate primary skin irritationand severe eye irritation in animals (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956).At 260 ppm, animals experienced irritation of the eyes and respiratorydistress; at high levels (e.g., 400, 600, and 900 ppm), corneal opacitiesand severe respiratory difficulties occurred (Hine, Kodama, Wellingtonet al. 1956). The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 2.55 g/kg. Intragastric administration of AGEin mice, rats, and rabbits has also been demonstrated to cause depressionof the central nervous system (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956).In humans, skin sensitization occurs readily (Hine and Rowe 1962), and,based on animal studies, percutaneous absorption would appear likely. Inaddition to primary irritation and sensitization, the potential existsfor cross-sensitization with other epoxy agents (ACGIH 1986, p. 20).OSHA is proposing to establish a PEL of 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and to supplementthis with a 15-minute STEL of 10 ppm, and with a skin notation, to ensureprotection against primary irritation and to minimize sensitization effects.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combination of full-shiftand short-term limits, in addition to a skin notation, will reduce therisk of sensitization, primary irritation, and percutaneous absorptionto which workers could otherwise be exposed at the current ceiling of 10ppm.

Allyl propyl disulfide is a liquid with a pungent,irritating odor.Nearly all occupational exposures to allyl propyl disulfide, the primaryvolatile constituent of onion oil, occur in the processing of onions andonion products. Allyl propyl disulfide's irritative effects on the humaneye, nose, and upper respiratory tract are well recognized. The most severeirritation effects have occurred when workers were exposed to allyl propyldisulfide in the vicinity of onion slicing machines, where average concentrationsof 3.4 ppm have been measured (Feiner, Burke, and Baliff 1946).OSHA proposes a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA limit and a STEL of 3 ppm to protect againstirritation and lacrimation, which can occur as a result of higher short-termexposures. OSHA preliminarily concludes that adding a STEL of 3 ppm willreduce the risk of lacrimation and upper respiratory tract irritation towhich employees could otherwise be exposed.

No. 1021</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for ammonia is 50 ppm TWA. The ACGIH revised its TLV-TWAto 25 ppm in 1973, and added a 35-ppm STEL in 1976. NIOSH (1974a) has recommendeda 5-minute short-term limit of 50 ppm for ammonia. Ammonia is principallyused as a feedstock in the manufacture of fertilizers and other chemicalsubstances, and is also used as a refrigerant.The chief effect resulting from exposure to ammonia is eye and upper respiratorytract irritation. Vigliani and Zurlo (1956) reported respiratory tractirritation and irritation of the conjunctivae in workers exposed to 100ppm; exposure to a concentration of 20 ppm caused complaints of discomfortamong uninjured workers. An analysis of plant surveys (Bureau of IndustrialHygiene, Detroit Department of Health, 1965-1970) conducted by ACGIH (1986)showed that the ``complaint level'' was between 20 and 25 ppm. ACGIH (1986)also stated in their documentation for the ammonia TLVs that general fieldexperience with a ``large number of workers'' exposed to ammonia from printingand copying machines indicated that concentrations of 20 to 25 ppm werethe maximum concentrations not associated with complaints of irritation.The ACGIH selected a 25-ppm TLV-TWA and a 35-ppm TLV-STEL ``to protectagainst irritation to eyes and respiratory tract and minimize discomfortamong uninjured workers'' (ACGIH 1986).In recommending a 5-minute 50-ppm short-term limit, NIOSH relied on severalreports that ammonia concentrations as low as 50 ppm are moderately irritating(Vigliani and Zurlo 1956; Industrial Biotest Laboratories 1973; MacEwenet al. 1970; Mangold 1971; Pagnotto 1973). NIOSH concluded that the ``irritatingor annoying effects * * * [are] more dependent upon concentration thanlength of exposure,'' and that ``a standard expressed as a time-weightedaverage is inappropriate since it would permit fluctuations to concentrationsconsiderably higher than 50 ppm'' (NIOSH 1974a, p. 69). Therefore, NIOSHrecommended a 50-ppm ceiling limit to restrict 5-minute fluctuations inexposure levels and to ``ensure that such possibly irritating exposuresare brief'' (NIOSH 1974a, p. 70).The ACGIH (1986) disagreed that a short-term limit alone was more appropriatethan a TWA limit, citing animal evidence (Stombaugh 1960) indicating thatcontinuous, 24-hour exposure over several days produced effects not observedfrom high, short-term exposures. NIOSH also reviewed this and other evidence(Doig and Willoughby 1971; Coon et al. 1970), showing that laboratory animalsexhibited chronic lung inflammation and marked thickening of the trachealepithelium following continuous exposure to average concentrations exceeding100 ppm. Continuous exposure to concentrations below 100 ppm did not generallyresult in microscopic lung abnormalities (Coon et al. 1970; Stombaugh etal. 1969).OSHA believes that the human evidence discussed by the ACGIH (1986) andNIOSH (1974a) clearly indicates that the current limit of 50 ppm as an8-hour TWA would permit short-term exposures to levels well above thosereported to caused conjunctival and respiratory tract irritation, evenamong workers who are acclimated to the effects of ammonia. OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that there is a risk of mucosal irritation at the current PELand that it is necessary to lower the PEL to reduce that risk. The 50-ppm5-minute ceiling recommended by NIOSH is above exposure levels that arereported to be moderately irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.Therefore, OSHA is proposing to revise its existing PEL for ammonia to25 ppm as a TWA and 35 ppm as a STEL. Extensive air sampling data reportedin the IMIS data base show that more than 90 percent of exposures are below25 ppm TWA and thus demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed limits.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level.

Ammoniumchloride is a white crystalline solid, somewhat hygroscopic, with a cool,saline taste.Ammonium chloride is an irritant to the skin and respiratory passages wheninhaled and produces mild systemic toxicity when ingested (Sax 1968). Largeamounts of fume can be generated during galvanizing operations, and thesefumes should be controlled to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract(ACGIH 1986, p. 28).OSHA proposes a permissible exposure limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA, with a 15-minuteshort-term limit of 20 mg/m\3\, to protect workers exposed to ammoniumchloride fume in the numerous applications in general industry involvingthis substance. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combinationof TWA and STEL limits will protect workers against the risk of respiratoryirritation and systemic effects, and will eliminate or reduce this risk.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor ammonium chloride fume.

It is also known that chronic exposure to small amounts can causemild gastroenteritis and dermatitis (Browning 1969; Deichmann and Gerarde1969; Thienes and Haley 1972). However, neither of these types of systemicpoisoning have been reported in the workplace (Browning 1969).In the workplace, the salient toxic effects of the tetraborates are acuteirritation of the skin, eyes, nose, and upper respiratory tract.

Bromine is a dark, reddish-brown,non-combustible, diatomic liquid that has irritating vapors.Early studies of bromine exposure indicated that workers exposed to 0.75ppm for 6 hours exhibited no symptoms (Flury and Zernik 1931). Later studiesreported physiological responses to different concentrations of bromineand used these findings to make the following recommendations: The maximalallowable concentration for prolonged exposure should be 0.1 to 0.15 ppm,and the maximal allowable concentration for short exposure (i.e., 30 minutesto 1 hour) should be 4 ppm (Henderson and Haggard 1943). These investigatorsfound levels of 40 to 60 ppm dangerous for short-term exposures, and alevel of 1000 ppm proved rapidly fatal even during short exposures. Theseauthors reported that the effects of exposure to bromine include respiratoryirritation and lung edema. Elkins (1951) reported that exposure at 1 ppmin a plant handling liquid bromine was excessively irritating.OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.1 ppm (8-hour TWA) and a STEL of 0.3 ppm for a15-minute period. The Agency believes that both the TWA and short-termlimits are necessary to reduce the risk of respiratory irritation and lungdamage that could occur in the absence of a short-term limit.

Some authors(Nelson, Nelson, Ross et al. 1943) report that exposures to 200 ppm causedmild eye irritation in some subjects and that others experienced theseeffects even at concentrations of 100 ppm. Studies conducted in the 1940snoted low-grade intoxication at 300 to 600 ppm (Smith and Mayers 1944),slight nose and throat irritation at 100 ppm, and mild eye irritation at200 ppm (Nelson, Nelson, Ross et al. 1943). Later studies have shown thatapproximately 50 percent of exposed individuals experience eye and noseirritation at 200 ppm (as reported in ACGIH 1986, p. 395).OSHA is proposing a 15-minute STEL of 300 ppm and an 8-hour TWA limit of200 ppm to protect exposed individuals against the short-term exposuresknown to cause irritation. However, since a significant number of all exposedworkers experience adverse irritant effects even at 200 ppm, the Agencyrealizes that the 300-ppm STEL may not be fully protective.

When exposed to 4200 ppm n-butylacetate for 6 days at 6 hours per day, cats experienced slight irritationof the respiratory passage; at 3100 ppm, changes in blood cell morphologywere recorded. At exposures of 1600 ppm, these cats exhibited slight irritationof the eyes and salivation (Flury and Wirth 1933). Air concentrations of10,000 ppm (n-butyl acetate proved fatal to rats after 8 hours; 4 hoursof exposure at the same level produced no deaths (Smyth, et al. 1956).A paper by Sayers, Schrenk, and Patty (1936) reported that guinea pigsdemonstrated eye irritation effects at 3300 ppm, became unconscious after9 hours exposure to 7000 ppm, and died after 4 hours of exposure to 14,000ppm.Human volunteers complained that throat irritation, which began at an exposurelevel of 2000 ppm n-butyl acetate, worsened and became quite severe at300 ppm (Nelson, Ege, Morwich et al. 1943).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 150 ppm and a 200-ppm STEL for n-butylacetate. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits are necessaryto protect workers from the risks of eye, skin and respiratory irritation,in addition to narcotic effects, potentially associated with exposuresto this substance at the levels permitted by the 8-hour limit alone.

No. 1053</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for n-butyl lactate. The ACGIH-recommendedlimit is a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm. Butyl lactate is a colorless liquid esterof lactic acid.In humans, prolonged exposures to n-butyl lactate at approximately 7 ppm,with brief peak excursions to 11 ppm, caused headache, irritation of thepharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa, and coughing in all workers, and occasionalnausea, vomiting, and sleepiness in some (Zuidema and Pel 1969, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 82). Headache, coughing, and irritation of the pharynxwere sometimes related to n-butyl lactate concentrations of 4 ppm; however,no adverse effects were observed at a concentration of 1.4 ppm. Studiesemploying improved sampling and analytic methods have subsequently concludedthat, although the odor of n-butyl lactate is discernible at the 7-ppmlevel, this concentration does not produce objectionable or injurious effects(Turner 1972).OSHA proposes a limit of 5 ppm TWA for n-butyl lactate to protect againstthe risk of irritation, headache, nausea, and coughing associated withoccupational exposures to this substance. However, the Agency notes thatstudies show adverse effects at levels below the proposed 5-ppm limit.OSHA specifically requests data on the health effects associated with exposuresto this substance and the airborne concentrations at which such effectsoccur. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit for n-butyl lactate. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">n-BUTYL MERCAPTAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-79-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>SH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has recommended a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm.The NIOSH REL for n-butyl mercaptan is 0.5 as a 15-minute short-term exposure.Humans exposed to concentrations of butyl mercaptan report that the ``readilynoticeable'' odor level for this substance is between 0.1 and 1 ppm, althoughthe odor threshold is significantly below this level (ranging from 0.001to 0.0001 ppm). Gobbato and Terribile (1968) have reported that symptomsof CNS toxicity occurred in humans exposed for 1 hour to concentrationsof n-butyl mercaptan believed to lie in the range of 50 to 500 ppm. Thesesame authors reported that mucosal irritation occurred in human volunteersexposed to 4 ppm of ethyl mercaptan, a closely related substance. Irritationdid not occur at exposures to 0.4 ppm. The ACGIH established the TLV at0.5 ppm, which is approximately halfway between 0.1- to 1.0-ppm levelsreported as being readily noticeable (ACGIH 1986). Thus, the ACGIH TLVwas not set at a level designed to protect against detecting the odor ofbutyl mercaptan, but to avoid the intolerable odor effects of higher concentrationsof this substance. NIOSH (1978) recommended a 15-minute short-term limitof 0.5 ppm because the toxic action of n-butyl mercaptan, like that ofother thiol compounds, is expressed as an acute effect. NIOSH concludedthat a short-term limit was more appropriate than a TWA limit, and that``use of a ceiling [i.e., short-term] concentration instead of a TWA hasthe effect of increasing the protection provided to the worker about twofold''(NIOSH 1978, p. 85).OSHA preliminarily concludes that the current PEL for n-butyl mercaptanis insufficient to protect workers from experiencing the adverse acuteeffects caused by exposure to this substance. The current PEL of 10 ppmis between 10 and 100 times higher than the concentration of n-butyl mercaptanthat is readily detected by smell and is more than twice the concentrationreported as causing mucosal irritation for a closely related substance.OSHA finds that workers are at risk of these acute effects in the absenceof a more stringent limit and is proposing to reduce its exposure limitfor n-butyl mercaptan to 0.5 ppm TWA. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for n-butyl mercaptan if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CAMPHOR (SYNTHETIC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-22-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>16</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Synthetic camphor is a colorlessor white crystalline substance with an aromatic odor.Synthetic camphor is known to cause severe injuries in animals exposedfor prolonged periods by inhalation to 6 mg/m\3\. Exposure may cause convulsions,congestion and changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and damage to thekidneys and brain (Flury and Zernik 1931). Animal bioassays showed thatcamphor was not carcinogenic in rats injected subcutaneously; however,when the cancer promoter, croton oil, was concurrently applied to the skinof mice, two of 110 treated mice developed carcinomas (Graffi et al. 1953).In humans, there are reports of industrial exposure to camphor that resultedin coma, dyspnea, and headache; one fatality from inhalation of the vaporhas been noted (Flury and Zernik 1931). Exposures for up to 10 months ina synthetic camphor packing plant are reported not to have involved eyeand nose irritation if concentrations were maintained at or below 2 ppm(Gronka, Bobkoski, Tomchick, and Rakow 1969). However, the same authorsreport that these packing plant workers did experience nose and throatinflammation. OSHA proposes a TWA of 2 ppm and a STEL of 3 ppm for synthetic camphorto prevent the risk of irritation to the eyes, nose, and central nervoussystem potentially associated with elevated exposures to this substance.The Agency preliminarily concludes that the combined TWA-STEL is necessaryto reduce this risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for synthetic camphor if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CAPROLACTAM (DUST)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 105-60-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1064</ITAG>OSHA has no current permissible exposure limit for caprolactam dust. TheACGIH recommends a 1-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for this substance, with a short-termexposure limit of 3 mg/m\3\. Caprolactam is a white crystalline solid withan unpleasant odor.In humans, caprolactam has been shown to be a convulsant, a dermal andrespiratory irritant, and a dermal sensitizer, but dosage levels in humansare ill-defined (Ferguson and Wheller 1973; Tuma, Fossela, and Waidhofer1981). In animals, exposure to caprolactam by several routes can causeconvulsions, tremors, mydriasis, opisthotonus (Elison, Lein, Zinger, etal. 1971; Lein, Lein, and Tong 1971) and salivation (Goldblatt et al. 1954).Cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been reported in rabbits andcats, with an initial increase in blood pressure followed by a decreasein blood pressure and an increased respiratory rate (Goldblatt, Farquharson,Bennett, and Askew 1954). Weight loss and initial growth depression occurin rates and mice (Morrison, Ross, and Ruth 1980).One animal study observed that caprolactam's convulsant effects on rats,rabbits, and cats occur at injection doses above 100 mg/kg (Goldblatt etal. 1954). Results of studies in guinea pigs were consistent with thesefindings (Hohensee 1951). In a 90-day feeding study of dogs, Burdock, Kolwick,Alsakor, and Marshal (1984) reported that dogs given dietary dose levelsof 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 percent caprolactam showed weight losses at 1.0 percentand lesser losses at 0.5 percent. Hematologic and ophthalmologic changesdid not occur. In a 2-year bioassay of rats and mice, caprolactam was notobserved to be carcinogenic (NCI/NTP 1982). A Polish study in animals observedhematologic and systemic changes, increased mortality, kidney and liverdamage, and growth inhibition in animals given daily doses of 50 or 100mg/kg (Zwierzchowski et al. 1967).The results of early studies of caprolactam's teratogenicity in rats andrabbits indicate that it is not teratogenic even at doses as high as 1000mg/kg/day (Gas, Powers, Robinson et al. 1984).Studies of industrial exposures to caprolactam dust in Germany report severeirritation on inhalation of 10 percent caprolactam in dust (Hohensee 1951).Workers experienced a bitter taste, nervousness, epistaxis, upper respiratorytract irritation, and dry and splitting skin on the lips and nose (Hohensee1951). Ferguson and Wheller (1973) found that some workers exposed to caprolactamvapors experienced nose and throat irritation at concentrations above 10ppm, and others reported irritation at levels below 10 ppm. Direct contactwith the solid form of caprolactam produces primary skin irritation (Ferguson,unpublished communication, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 96-2). Brief (unpublishedcommunication, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 96-2) also reports that the dustproduces skin irritation.OSHA is proposing a permissible exposure limit of 1 mg/m3 TWA and a 3-mg/m3STEL for caprolactam dust to prevent the risk of respiratory and skin irritationand of sensitization, to which workers can be subjected in the absenceof any OSHA limit. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combinationof limits will substantially reduce this risk. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for caprolactam (dust). Atthe time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CAPROLACTAM (VAPOR)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 105-60-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>NO  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1065</ITAG>OSHA has no current permissible exposure limit for caprolactam as vapor.The ACGIH recommends a TVL-TWA of 20 mg/m3 for the vapor, supplementedby a STEL of 40 mg/m3. Caprolactam is a white, crystalline solid at roomtemperature, and thus high vapor levels occur only at elevated temperatures. The health effects of exposure to caprolactam vapor are identical to thosedescribed for caprolactam dust, except that contact with the vapor is reportedto be even more irritating (Hohensee 1951). Workers exposed to the vaporat approximately 12 ppm complained of a bitter taste in the mouth, nervousness,epistaxis, upper respiratory tract congestion, and dry and splitting skin;other workers reported experiencing heartburn, flatulence, and a heavyfeeling in the stomach (Hohensee 1951).  In another report of industrial exposure to the vapor, Ferguson and Wheeler(1973) reported that workers routinely exposed to unspecified levels andoccasionally to concentrations as high as 100 ppm for 18 years reportedsevere discomfort from burning nose, throat, and eyes. This irritationresponse was dose-related, with no workers reporting effects at 7 ppm orbelow, some experiencing transient upper respiratory tract irritation atlevels above that, and others reporting eye irritation at concentrationsof 25 ppm and above (Ferguson and Wheeler 1973). Ferguson (private communication,1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 96.1) noted that a group of 143 workers,some of whom were exposed for as long as 17 years to vapor concentrationsof 5 to 10 ppm showed no evidence of adverse effects. At higher vapor exposures(53 to 521 mg/m3), all subjects experienced eye irritation (Ferguson, privatecommunication, 1972). Human volunteers exposed at low relative humiditiesto concentrations of the vapor in the range of 10 to 100 ppm showed a dose-relatedresponse, but at higher relative humidities, no irritation was observedbelow a concentration of 14 ppm (Ferguson and Wheeler 1973).  OSHA is proposing to establish an 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 20 mg/m3for caprolactam vapor and to supplement this with a STEL of 40 mg/m3. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that this combination of limits will protectworkers from the risk of eye, upper respiratory, and skin irritation towhich they could otherwise be exposed in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor caprolactam vapor.

No. 1077</ITAG>OHSA currently has no limit for cesium hydroxide. The ACGIH recommendsa threshold limit vlaue of 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. Cesium hydroxide isa colorless or yellowish fused crystalline mass; it is the strongest baseknown and is highly soluble in water and alcohol.  Animal studies indicate that cesium hydroxide has an acute oral toxicityof about one-third that of potassium hydroxide, which causes lesions ofthe nasal septum and irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract (Kanpov1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 495). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for cesium hydroxide in rats is 1016 mg/kg. A concentrationof 5 percent cesium hydroxide did not produce skin irritation; however,severe irritation of the eyes resulted from contact with a 5-percent concentrationof cesium hydroxide. Cesium hydroxide does not cause skin sensitization(Johnson, Lewis, and Perone 1972).  OSHA proposes a TWA of 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour permissible exposure limitfor cesium hydroxide. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limitwill protect exposed workers from the risk of severe eye irritation associatedwith exposure to this substance at the levels permitted in the absenceof any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for cesium hydroxide.

No. 1079</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for chlorine is a 1-ppm ceiling limit. The ACGIHhas recommended a TLV-TWA of 1 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 3 ppm. NIOSH (1976e)has recommended a limit of 0.5 ppm over a 15-minute sampling duration. Exposure to chlorine at concentrations around 5 ppm has been associatedwith respiratory symptoms, erosion of teeth, and inflammation of mucousmembranes (Flury and Zernik 1931; Patty 1963). Ferris et al. (1964) reportedslight effects on the respiratory system in workers exposed to chlorineranging from negligible to 7 ppm. Rupp and Henschler (1967) reported burningof the eyes among human subjects exposed to 0.4 ppm; some of these subjectsreported painful eyes after 15 minutes' exposure to this level. In a separatetest, subjects reported respiratory irritation upon exposure to 0.5 ppm,and a concentration of 1 ppm was described as being uncomfortable.  After reviewing these reports, the ACGIH recommended the 1-ppm TLV-TWAand 3-ppm TLV-STEL to ``minimize chronic changes in the lungs, acceleratedaging, and erosion of the teeth'' (ACGIH 1986, p. 117). NIOSH (1976e) reviewedthese studies, as well as others (Matt 1889; Beck 1959) that reported ocularand respiratory irritation associated with exposure to chlorine levelsof around 1 ppm for 30 minutes or less. NIOSH (1976e) recommended a 15-minute0.5-ppm limit to prevent possible eye and respiratory tract irritation.The current OSHA limit for chlorine (1 ppm ceiling) and the ACGIH TLVs(1 ppm TWA and 3 ppm STEL) are inadequate to protect against the risk toworkers' health. Studies show that humans exposed to 0.4 ppm experiencedburning of the eyes, and when exposed to 0.5 ppm they experienced respiratoryirritation. The subjects were ``uncomfortable'' when exposed to 1 ppm ofchlorine. OSHA therefore proposes adoption of the NIOSH REL (0.5 ppm ceiling)to prevent possible eye and respiratory irritation and thus substantiallyto reduce this risk. The Agency's preliminary feasibility analysis is basedon limited data at this level; additional feasibility information is requestedfrom the public. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for chlorine if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLOROACETYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-04-9; Chemical Formula: ClCH<T2>2</T2>COCl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1083</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for chloroacetyl chloride. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm. Chloroacetyl chloride is a colorless liquid witha pungent odor.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats fed this substance is between 0.12 and 0.25 g/kg. Chloroacetylchloride is corrosive to the skin and eyes, and skin absorption of thissubstance can be lethal. Inhalation of 4 ppm for 5 to 10 minutes causedrespiratory problems in rats; however, no effect was observed in theseanimals when they inhaled 2.5 ppm for a period of 7 hours (Dow ChemicalCompany 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 122). Thirty-day inhalation studieswith rats, mice, and hamsters showed eye and respiratory irritation at2.5 ppm and no effect at 0.5 ppm (Dow Chemical Company 1977, as cited inACGIH 1986, p. 122).Reports of the acute effects associated with exposure to chloracetyl chloridein humans include mild to moderate skin burns and erythema, eye burns andtearing, cough, dyspnea, and cyanosis, as well as mild gastrointestinaleffects. Eye and respiratory irritation occurred in an industrial settingcharacterized by an exposure level of 0.009 to 0.017 ppm, with excursionsas high as 0.140 ppm (Dow Chemical Company 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 122). An accidental drenching with a mixture containing chloroacetylchloride resulted in extensive first- and second-degree burns, pulmonaryedema, and three episodes of cardiac arrest, followed by coma and anoxia-inducedbrain damage (Pagnotto 1978, as cited in ACGIH, p. 122). Other ingredientsof the mixture involved in the accident included xylidine, benzene, andsodium carbonate. Rescuers of this victim experienced hand blisters, chesttightness, and nausea for 2 days.OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.05 ppm TWA for chloroacetyl chloride. The Agencypreliminary concludes that this limit is necessary to protect exposed employeesfrom the risk of eye, skin, and respiratory irritation; gastrointestinaleffects; and severe systemic effects, including life-threatening coma,cardiac arrest, and pulmonary edema, to which workers could presently beexposed in the absence of any OSHA limit.

The ACGIH recommends a ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm,with a skin notation. o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile is a white crystallinesolid with a pepper-like odor.This substance has extremely irritating properties. It causes intense eyeand skin irritation, coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness,running nose, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. These effects are evidenton exposure to concentrations between 12 and 20 mg/m3, and they becomeincapacitating within 20 seconds of exposure; the effects persist for approximately5 to 10 minutes after the victim has been removed to fresh air (<T3>Military Chemistry and Chemical Agents</T3> 1963).OCBM is only slightly toxic to laboratory animals when they are exposedintravenously, subcutaneously, or through inhalation (Punte, Weimer, Ballard,and Wilding 1962). In animals, it has been demonstrated that OCBM is metabolizedby the body to cyanide (Frankenberg and Sorbo 1973). Short-term exposuresto high levels of OCBM did not cause carcinogenic, teratogenic, or embryolethaleffects in animals (McNamara et al. 1973).Three of four human volunteers exposed to a 1.5-mg/m3 concentration ofOCBM aerosol dispersed from a 10-percent solution in methylene chloridefor 90 minutes developed headaches, and one showed mild eye and nose irritation.Headaches persisted for 24 hours in two subjects. At 4 to 5 mg/m3, subjects'problem-solving abilities were affected and they showed eye irritation,conjunctivitis, lacrimation, and skin burning (Punte, Owens, and Gutentag1963). Other researchers observed no persistent clinical abnormalitiesin seven subjects exposed to OCBM at concentrations ranging from 1 to 13mg/m3 over a 15-day period; however, none of these subjects developed atolerance for the compound. Severe skin senitization has also been reportedin workers handling OCBM (Schumes and Taylor 1973).OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 0.05 ppm and a skin notation for o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits arenecessary to protect workers from the risk of severe eye and upper respiratorytract irritation, skin sensitization, dyspnea, nausea, lacrimation, vomiting,and performance decrement associated with brief exposures to this substance.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 10 ppm for this colorless gas, which has a pungent, almond-like odor.The acute toxicity for cyanogen in various animal species is high (Fluryand Zernik 1931). One-hundred ppm was fatal to cats in 2 to 3 hours, and400 ppm was fatal to rabbits in less than 2 hours. However, rabbits exposedto 100 ppm for 4 hours showed practically no effects. Cats exposed to 50ppm were severely affected but recovered (Flury and Zernik 1931). Investigationsin the rat suggest that cyanogen is approximately 10 times less acutelytoxic than is hydrogen cyanide (McNerney and Schrenk 1960).Human tests showed that subjects experienced almost immediate eye and nasalirritation at exposures of 16 ppm (McNerney and Schrenk 1960).OSHA proposes a PEL of 10 ppm TWA for cyanogen. Because of the high acutetoxicity of this substance in experimental animals, the Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit is necessary to protect against the risk of irritationand systematic effects associated with exposure at the levels permittedin the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for cyanogen.

The ACGIH recommendsa ceiling limit of 0.3 ppm for this colorless liquid or gas, which hasa pungent odor.The chronic effects of cyanogen chloride, which include hoarseness, conjunctivitis,and edema of the eyelid, have long been recognized (Reed 1920).Flury and Zernik (1931) observed the effects of exposure to cyanogen chloridein five animal species. In mice, a concentration of approximately 500 ppmwas fatal within 3 minutes; in cats, 120 ppm was fatal in 3.5 minutes;48 ppm was fatal to dogs in 6 hours; in goats, a 1000-ppm exposure for3 minutes caused death after 70 hours; and 1200 ppm was fatal to the rabbit.Several other studies have demonstrated that animals exposed to cyanogenchloride exhibit pulmonary edema and interference with cellular metabolism(Jandorf and Bodansky 1946; Aldrich and Evans 1946).Human data indicate that 1 ppm is the lowest irritant concentration fora 10-minute exposure; 2 ppm was intolerable for this time period, and 48ppm was fatal in 30 minutes (Prentiss 1937). The Michigan Department ofPublic Health (1977) reported that a concentration of about 0.7 ppm causedsevere eye and nasal irritation, forcing workers to quit the area.OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 0.3 ppm for cyanogen chloride. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that this ceiling is necessary to protectexposed workers from the risks of severe irritation, metabolic effects,and pulmonary edema associated with exposure to this substance at the levelspermitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.

Schrenk,Patty, and Yant (1933) report that guinea pigs exposed to the vapor ofdichloroethyl ether at 500 ppm experienced immediate and severe eye andnose irritation, respiratory disturbances after 1.5 to 3 hours, and deathafter 5 to 8 hours. Lung, kidney, liver, and brain damage were also observedin these animals; exposure to a reduced level of 105 ppm caused eventualdeath after 10 hours of continuous exposure. A one-hour exposure to 105ppm caused irritation only (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani 1949). At 35ppm, for an unspecified duration, irritation but no other adverse effectswere observed (Schrenk, Patty, and Yant 1933). Rats responded similarly,with 4-hour exposures to 250 ppm proving lethal (Carpenter, Smyth, andPozzani 1949).Repeated exposures to 69 ppm (7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 130 days) causedno serious injury in rats or guinea pigs; only mild stress-related effectswere noted (Kosyan 1969). However, other studies of guinea pigs have shownmild primary irritative effects on the skin, and fatalities occurred when300 mg/kg was applied dermally as a pure liquid for 24 hours (Smyth, Jr.and Carpenter 1948). Direct contact of dichloroethyl ether with the eyecauses moderate pain, conjunctival irritation, and transient corneal injury(Carpenter and Smyth 1946). A sufficient amount of dichloroethyl ethercan be absorbed through the skin to be lethal (Carpenter and Smyth 1946).Mice have been reported to develop hepatomas after prolonged oral administration(80 weeks) at 300 mg/kg (Innes et al. 1969).Humans exposed briefly to dichloroethyl ether at concentrations above 550ppm experienced intolerable eye and nasal irritation, with coughing, nausea,and retching. Concentrations between 100 and 260 ppm were irritating buttolerable; however, the odor of dichloroethyl ether was still nauseatingat 35 ppm (Schrenk, Patty, and Yant 1933). Eye irritation has been reportedfrom industrial exposure to a concentration of dichloroethyl ether of 2.5ppm (Bell and Jones 1958). A single fatality, presumably from inhalationof the vapor, has been reported but not documented (Elkins 1959).OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 pm and a STEL of 10 ppm, with askin notation, for dichloroethyl ether. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this combination of limits will protect workers against the risk ofirritation, lung injury, and nausea associated with occupational exposureto elevated levels of dichloroethyl ether. The skin notation is proposedbecause dichloroethyl ether can cause systemic toxicity if percutaneouslyabsorbed. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing arevision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for dichloroethyl ether if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">2,2-DICHLOROPROPIONIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-99-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CCl<T2>2</T2>COOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1130</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for 2,2-dichlororopionic acid. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV of 1 ppm TWA for this liquid.In a communication to the ACGIH (1986, p. 190), the Dow Chemical Company(1977) reported that 2,2-dichloropropionic acid is corrosive to the skinand can cause permanent injury to the eye. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is between 0.7 and 1 g/kg. Seven-hour exposures toa saturated atmosphere of the acid vapor caused no ill effects in rats,and a 120-day study of dietary exposure in rats showed a no-effect levelof 15 mg/kg/day (Dow Chemical Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 190).Acute human exposures have been reported to cause mild to moderate skin,eye, respiratory, and gastrointestinal irritation. Minimal respiratoryirritation was observed in workers exposed at concentrations of between2 and 7 ppm (ACGIH 1986, p. 190).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 1 ppm TWA for 2,2-dichloropropionic acid. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposed workersfrom the risk of eye, respiratory, and gastrointestinal irritation at thelevels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for 2,2-dichloropropionicacid. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit ifthe Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DIETHYLAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-89-7; CHEMICAL FORMULA: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>NH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIHhas established an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 25ppm for this substance, which is a colorless liquid with an ammonia-likeodor.Diethylamine is a strong irritant of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes,and chronic sublethal exposures cause tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis,and pulmonary edema (ACGIH 1986, p. 197). In rabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 0.82 ml/kg, and instillation of solutions of 1 percent orgreater into the eyes of rabbits caused corneal opacity (Sutton 1963).Direct contact of the skin with diethylamine causes necrosis (ACGIH 1986,p. 197). Rabbits exposed 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks to 50 or100 ppm diethylamine survived; those exposed to 50 ppm showed marked lungand corneal irritation, and, occasionally, degeneration of the heart muscle(Brieger and Hodes 1951). In the animals exposed to 100 ppm, these changeswere more severe, and the parenchymatous degeneration of the heart musclewas marked (Brieger and Hodes 1951).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm and a STEL of 25 ppm for diethylamine.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combined limit will protectworkers from the risk of skin burns, corneal injury, pulmonary irritation,and skin, eye, and upper respiratory tract irritation potentially associatedwith exposures to this substance at the levels permitted by an 8-hour limitalone. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revisionto this level.

Diisobutyl ketone has a uniformly low acutetoxicity by all routes of exposure. Rats and guinea pigs survived singleexposures of from 7.5 to 16 hours to essentially saturated vapor (McOmieand Anderson 1949). Smyth and co-workers (1949) reported that five of sixrats died after exposure to 2000 ppm for 8 hours; they also reported apercutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits of greater than 20 ml/kg. Direct application ofdiisobutyl ketone to rabbit skin was only mildly irritating, and no eyeirritation was reported after instillation into the rabbit eye. The oraltoxicity for the rat was reported as 5.8 g/kg (Smyth et al. 1949). Carpenterand Smyth (1946) reported a no-effect level for diisobutyl ketone of 125ppm in rats and guinea pigs given thirty 7-hour exposures. At 250 ppm,the liver and kidney weights of female rats increased, and the liver weightsof male guinea pigs decreased; at levels of 530 and 920 ppm, rats showedincreased liver and kidney weights; and at 1650 ppm, increased mortalitywas noted (Carpenter and Smyth 1946). Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946) reported eye irritation and complaintsof objectionable odor in volunteer human exposures to concentrations above25 ppm. No worker illnesses have been linked to diisobutyl ketone exposure(ACGIH 1986, p. 203)OSHA proposes a TWA limit of 25 ppm for diisobutyl ketone. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect workers against the risk of irritationthat is asociated with workplace exposures to diisobutyl ketone levelsgreater than 25 ppm. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for diisobutyl ketone if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">EPICHLOROHYDRIN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-89-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>5</T2>ClO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1158</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit on 5 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, for epichlorohydrin.the ACGIH has established a limit of 2 ppm TWA, also with a skin notation.NIOSH recommends reducing employee exposure to the lowest feasible limit,and considers epichlorohydrin a carcinogen.In animals, epichlorohydrin is irritating and systemically toxic by allroutes of exposure (Shell Chemical Corporation 1958, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 233). Fatalities are caused and central nervous system and respiratorytract effects resulting from exposure to high concentrations.In mice, single 30-minute exposures to 8300 ppm of epichlorohydrin vaporcaused muscular paralysis and death from respiratory failure; similar resultshave been reported for dermal application of the liquid at 0.5 ml/kg inrats, and repeated oral administration at 0.1 mg/kg in mice (Shell ChemicalCorporation 1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 233). At 32 ppm (7 hours/day,5 days/week) for 91 days, rats failed to show normal weight gain, and at16 ppm they showed increased kidney size (ACGIH 1986, p. 233). Gage (1959)confirmed these findings and demonstrated lung, liver, and kidney injuryin rats from repeated 6-hour exposures at concentrations ranging from 17to 120 ppm. No effects were observed by this author at 9 ppm. The oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 260 mg/kg, and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is reported as 755 mg/kg (Lawrence 1972). A 4-hourexposure at a level of 250 ppm was fatal to rats (Carpenter 1949).There have also been reports of carcinogenicity in mice from dermal applicationand subcutaneous injection (Van Duuren et al. 1974), as well as reproductiveeffects from injestion; mutagenic effects were observed in microbial systemsand in the fruit fly (NIOSH 1976).In humans exposed to concentrations above 100 ppm for brief periods, lungedema and kidney lesions have been reported (NIOSH 1976). Exposure at 20ppm caused burning of eyes and nasal mucosa (Wexler 1971). Another exposureto an unknown concentration caused eye and throat irritation, nausea, dyspnea,bronchitis, and an enlarged liver (Schultz 1964). Painful irritation ofsubcutaneous tissues follows skin contact in humans (ACGIH 1986, p. 233).OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, for epichlorohydrin.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the risk of dermal, respiratory, liver, and kidney effects that arepotentially associated with exposure to epichlorohydrin at elevated concentrations.The skin notation is retained because of this substance's capacity to penetratethe skin and cause toxicity. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level.

No. 1162</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for ethyl benzene. TheACGIH recommends a limit of 100 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 125 ppmfor this colorless, flammable liquid with an aromatic odor.Ethyl benzene is a skin and mucous membrane irritant. It is reported tobe the most severe irritant of the benzene series (Oettel 1936). In rabbits,repeated dermal application of the liquid causes reddening, exfoliation,and blistering of the skin (Wolf et al. 1956). The acute toxicity of ethylbenzene is low, with death reported to occur at 10,000 ppm in guinea pigsexposed for a few minutes; at 5000 ppm, ethyl benzene was described asdangerous to life for those exposed for 30 to 60 minutes. Dying animalssuffered intense congestion and edema of the lungs, as well as generalizedvisceral hyperemia (Yant, Schrenk, Waite, and Patty 1930). The narcoticdose in laboratory animals is reported to be 10,000 ppm (reached within18 minutes) and narcosis is preceded by vertigo, unsteadiness, and ataxia(Yant, Schrenk, Waite, and Patty 1930).Chronic inhalation exposures of guinea pigs, monkeys, rabbits, and ratsat concentrations of from 400 ppm to 2200 ppm, 7 to 8 hours/day, 5 days/weekfor as long as 6 months produced no effects in these species, except thatliver damage occurred, on the average, in animals exposed to 400 ppm for186 days (Wolf et al. 1956).Observations in humans suggest that intolerable eye and nose irritationoccurs at 5000 ppm; immediate and severe eye irritation and tearing andmoderate nose irritation is exhibited at 2000 ppm; and irritation thatreportedly can be tolerated occurs at 1000 ppm. At 200 ppm, the vapor producestransient eye irritation (Gerarde 1963).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 100 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 125 ppmfor ethyl benzene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of theselimits are required to protect those exposed from the risk of irritationassociated with occupational exposure to ethyl benzene above the 100-ppmlevel even for a brief period.

No. 1164</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 400 ppm TWA for ethyl ether. The ACGIH recommendsthe same time-weighted average limit, with a STEL of 500 ppm for a 15-minuteperiod. Ethyl ether is a colorless, volatile, mobile liquid with a distinctodor and a burning, sweet taste. It is extremely flammable and is a severefire and explosion hazard when exposed to heat or flame.Ethyl ether causes narcosis and general anesthesia. Concentrations of 3.6to 6.5 volumes percent in air are anesthetic to humans; 7- to 10-percentconcentrations cause respiratory arrest, and concentrations greater than10 percent are fatal (ACGIH 1986, p. 259). Repeated workplace exposuresdeliberately induced to produce the so-called ``ether jag'' have causednarcosis, exhaustion, headache, dizziness, sleepiness, excitation, andother psychic disturbances (Hake and Rowe 1963). In women, albuminuriaand polycythemia may result (Browning 1965). Repeated exposure may causeskin desiccation; irritation of the mucous membranes and eyes occurs oncontact with the liquid or after exposure to high concentrations of thevapor (Hake and Rowe 1973). Nelson and co-workers (1943) reported thatworkers began to experience nasal irritation at 200 ppm (Nelson, Ege, Rosset al. 1943). Henderson and Haggard calculated that the amount of etherabsorbed by a man of average height at a concentration of 400 ppm wouldnot cause intoxication. Armor (1950) observed that exposure effects occuronly at levels of 500 ppm and above.OSHA is proposing a PEL of 400 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 500 ppmfor ethyl ether. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of theselimits are necessary to protect against the risk of narcosis and irritationpotentially associated with excursions above the 8-hour TWA level. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forethyl ether if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYL MERCAPTAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-08-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>SH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The NIOSH recommended exposure limit forthis substance is 0.5 ppm as a 15-minute ceiling. Ethyl mercaptan is acolorless liquid with a persistent and penetrating leek-like odor.Acute animal toxicity data concerning ethyl mercaptan are taken from asingle study that reports the following findings. The 4-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> values in rats and mice are 2770 ppm and 4420 ppm, respectively.In the rat, the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is reported to be approximately 450 mg/kg. One drop appliedto rabbit eyes caused only slight irritation, but high concentrations ofvapor caused considerable irritation within 15 minutes. Maximal sublethalintraperitoneal doses have been reported to induce deep sedation, withhigher exposures causing restlessness, muscular incoordination, skeletalmuscular paralysis, cyanosis, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Although inhalation tests showed no noteworthy pathology in rats, intraperitonealinjection caused lymphotic infiltration of the liver with occasional necrosis(Fairchild and Stokinger 1958).In chronic inhalation studies of rabbits, rats, and mice, a 5-month exposureto 40 ppm caused minimal cardiovascular and other systemic effects (Blivona1965).Studies of human volunteers, exposed at 4 ppm for 3 hours daily for 5 to10 days, have reported minimal effects. At this level, all subjects experiencedaltered taste and olfactory reactions, periodic nausea, mucous membraneirritation, and fatigue. Exposure to 0.4 ppm produced no unpleasant symptoms(ACGIH 1986, p. 262).OSHA is proposing to reduce its current ceiling limit of 10 ppm for ethylmercaptan to 0.5 ppm as a time-weighted average, to protect workers againstthe risk of nausea, fatigue, and irritation associated with exposure toconcentrations well below the current PEL. The Agency preliminary concludesthat the revised limit will substantially reduce this risk. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethylmercaptan if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYLENE GLYCOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-21-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>OHCH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1169</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for ethylene glycol. The ACGIH recommends aceiling limit of 50 ppm (approximately 125 mg/m3) for this clear, colorless,odorless, and hygroscopic liquid.Ethylene glycol poses virtually no exposure risk at room temperature becauseof its low vapor pressure; at elevated temperatures, however, exposuresare possible and adverse effects have been reported as a result of exposureto mists.In studies of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and moneys, Coon and colleagues(1970) reported that animals exposed over a 30-day period to concentrationsat 10 or 57 mg/m3 for 8 hours daily, 5 days per week, showed no adverseeffects. Moderate to severe eye irritation did occur in rats and rabbitsexposed at 12 mg/m3 for 24 hours per day for 90 days. (Coon et al. 1970).Wiley and co-workers reported no ill effects in animals exposed to approximately350 to 400 mg/m3, 8 hours per day, for 16 weeks (Wiley, Hueper, and vonOettingen 1936).Rowe concluded that daily exposure to 100 ppm of the vapor did not causesystemic or eye injuries (1962), although Troisi described nystagmus inoverexposed workers (concentrations not reported) (1950). In a human inhalationstudy, Wills and collegues (1974) reported that volunteers exposed to theaerosol from 20 to 22 hours per day for 4 weeks, at an average concentrationof 12 ppm, complained of throat irritation, mild headache, and lower backpain. Complaints were more pronounced when the concentration was raisedto 140 mg/m3 (50 ppm) for part of a day. Average concentrations of 80 ppmwere found intolerable by the subjects, who reported a burning sensationin the throat and respiratory passages; irritation was also common at 60ppm (1974).Based on evidence of an occupational risk of severe throat and respiratoryirritation associated with exposure to the vapor and mist, OSHA proposesa ceiling limit of 50 ppm for ethylene glycol; this level is just belowthe level at which clinical symptons were noted. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will substantially reduce the risk associatedwith the uncontrolled exposures at the currently uncontrolled level. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit forethylene glycol. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate anew limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYLIDENE NORBORNENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 16219-25-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>12</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This colorless liquid reacts with oxygen.In a range-finding study, five of six rats died following a 4-hour exposureto 4000 ppm 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil et al. 1967).Other studies of longer duration have reported that exposures to 237 ppmfor 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 88 days, resulted in death for21 of 24 rats. No deaths resulted from repeated exposures at 90 ppm, butrenal lesions and enlarged livers were observed, liver lesions, testicularatrophy, and hydrothorax occurred at the 237-ppm level (Kinkead, Pozzani,Geary, and Carpenter 1971). Beagle does similarly exposed to 93 ppm for89 days survived, but exhibited such effects as testicular atrophy, hepaticlesions, and slight blood changes. Less pronounced effects were seen afterexposure to 61 ppm, but no effects were seen at 22 ppm (Kinkead, Pozzani,Geary, and Carpenter 1971).Human volunteers exposed for 30 minutes to ethylidene norbornene concentrationsof 11 ppm experienced eye and nose irritation; at 6 ppm, transient eyeirritation occurred (ACGIH 1986, p. 261).OSHA proposes a ceiling limit of 5 ppm to minimize the risk of irritationthat has been documented to occur in occupational exposures to concentrationsas low as 6 ppm for 30-minute periods. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this limit will reduce this risk substantially. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for ethylidene norbornene.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">FURFURAL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-01-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>4</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1183</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm, with a skin notation,for furfural. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 2 ppm, also with a skinnotation. Furfural is a colorless, oily liquid that turns rust-coloredwhen exposed to air and light.An inhalation exposure to 260 ppm of furfural was fatal to rats but notto mice or rabbits. A 4-week exposure of dogs to 130 ppm for 6 hours aday caused liver damage, but no adverse effects were observed at 63 ppm(AIHA 1965).Bugyi and Lepold (1952) describe numbness of the tongue and oral mucosa,absence of a sense of taste, and labored breathing in workers exposed tofurfural (at unspecified levels) in a poorly ventilated facility. Koremanand Resnik (1930) state that inhalations of from 1.9 to 14 ppm furfuralcaused headaches, itching throat, and eye irritation; Kuhn (1944) reportedthat exposure to furfural damages the eyesight in some individuals. NIOSH(1975) describes widespread eye and respiratory tract irritation in workersat a griding wheel plant exposed to furfural vapor at levels ranging from5 to 16 ppm. However, Dunlop and Peters (1953) report that a 15-year studyof furfural use in the synthetic resin industry revealed that this substanceis not hazardous to health in facilities that are adequately ventilated,and that only occasional individual sensitivity was found.OSHA proposes a PEL of 2 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, for furfural. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that these limits will protect workers againstthe risk of headaches and eye and respiratory irritation associated withexposure to furfural at the levels permitted by OSHA's existing PEL.

No. 1184</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for furfuryl alcohol is 50 ppm TWA. NIOSH (1979) hasalso recommended a 50-ppm limit as a 10-hour TWA. The ACGIH recommendsa 10-ppm TLV-TWA, a 15-ppm TLV-STEL and a skin notation.  The basis for the ACGIH-recommended limits are two foundry studies in whichfurfuryl alcohol was released during core preparation. Apol (1973) reportedno discomfort among workers exposed to 10.8 ppm furfuryl alcohol, but severelacrimation occurred at 15.8 ppm. Formaldehyde was also present at a concentrationof 0.33 ppm. Burton and Rivera (1972) found no irritation, headache, ordizziness among workers exposed to 8-hour TWA concentrations of 5 and 6ppm, with excursions up to 16 ppm. The ACGIH concluded that a TLV-TWA of10 ppm with a 15-ppm TLV-STEL would protect workers against irritationeffects.  NIOSH (1979) also reviewed these studies, but concluded that it was unknownwhether the lacrimation reported by Apol (1973) was caused by furfurylalcohol, formaldehyde, or both combined. They also noted that the currentOSHA limit (50 ppm) is five times lower than the concentration reportedto cause no adverse effects in monkeys (Woods and Seevers 1954-56). NIOSH(1979) concluded that the 50-ppm limit should remain, since no informationexists showing that this limit offers inadequate protection.  The 50-ppm REL is based on the hypothesis that severe lacrimation notedin a foundry study was due to the presence of formaldehyde. More seriouseffects than severe lacrimation would occur at this formaldehyde level,and therefore OSHA believes that the health effects observed at 15.8 ppmare caused by exposure to furfuryl alcohol. OSHA thus finds that the RELdoes not provide adequate protection and proposes a 10-ppm (TWA), 15-ppm(STEL), and a skin notation for this substance to reduce this risk. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel.

Glutaraldehyde is strongly irritating to the nose, eyes, and skin (<T3>Human Sensory Irritation Threshold of Glutaraldehyde Vapor</T3> 1976,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 285) and can cause allergic contact dermatitisfrom occasional or incidental occupational exposure (Jordan et al. 1972).The rat oral LD<T2>50</T2> has been variously reported as 250, 820, and 2380 mg/kg (Stonehillet al. 1965; Smyth 1963, as cited in Fassett 1981; NIOSH 1975). The dermalLD<T2>50</T2> in the rabbit is 2560 mg/kg, and the 4-hour inhalation LD<T2>50</T2> in the rat is 5000 ppm (NIOSH 1975).  Mice exposed to alkalinized glutaraldehyde at 8 and 33 ppm for 24 hourshave showed marked nervous behavior and panting and washing of the faceand limbs; those exposed to 33 ppm exhibited signs of toxic hepatitis atautopsy (Varpela et al. 1971).  In a study of cold-sterilizing operation in which the operator was exposedfor 12 minutes to an activated 2-percent aqueous solution, a measurementof 0.38 ppm glutaraldehyde was taken in the operator's breathing zone;the operator and the investigators experienced severe eye, nose, and throatirritation as well as sudden headache at the end of this procedure (Schneiderand Blejer 1973). Another study employing very precise methods of airborneconcentration measurement reported the irritation response level for glutaraldehydeto be 0.3 ppm and the odor recognition threshold to be 0.04 ppm (Colwell1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 285).  OSHA proposes a ceiling level of 0.2 ppm for glutaraldehyde. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this ceiling limit will prevent the risk ofirritation to the eyes, nose, and throat potentially associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor glutaraldehyde. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEXACHLOROCYCLOPENTADIENE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 77-47-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>Cl<T2>6  </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1196</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for hexachlorocyclopentadiene. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.01 ppm. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is a yellow to amber-colored,nonflammable liquid with a pungent odor.  Hexachlorocyclopentadiene has a high order of acute toxicity in laboratoryanimals. Rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs died from inhaling 89.5 percentof the vapor in air (Treon, Cleveland, and Cappel 1955). In 150 daily exposuresof 7 hours each, rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs survived concentrationsof 0.15 ppm, but a similar exposure was fatal to four of five mice. Atapproximately twice this concentration, mice, rats, and most rabbits diedby or before the 25th exposure, but guinea pigs survived 30 exposures.The vapors caused tearing, labored respiration, and, at high concentrations,tremors. Treon and associates observed degenerative changes in the brain,heart, liver, adrenal glands, and kidneys; pulmonary irritation occurredin all species, even at the lowest concentration of 0.15 ppm. At higherconcentrations, pulmonary edema, hyperemia, necrotizing bronchitis, andbronchiolitis were observed.  In humans, there are few data concerning hexachlorocyclopentadiene's toxicity.Irritation is known to occur, but the intolerable odor and eye irritationassociated with exposure to hexachlorocyclopentadiene have discouragedprolonged exposures (McGilvray 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 300). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.01 ppm for this severely toxic substance.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers against the risks of exposure to this acute toxin at the levelspermitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. These risks include intenseeye and pulmonary irritation and multiple organ damage. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for hexachlorocyclopentadiene.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEXYLENE GLYCOL  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-41-5; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>-COHCH<T2>2</T2>-CHOH-CH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

In mice, the LD<T2>50</T2> is reported to be 3.8 ml/kg, and it is reported to be 4.79g/kg in rats. A single dose of 2.0 ml/kg induced hypnosis in mice. Undilutedhexylene glycol instilled into the rabbit eye caused irritation and cornealinjury (Smyth and Carpenter 1948).  The Shell Chemical Corporation has reported that oral administration ofhexylene glycol can cause nervous system depression that is manifestedby an initial state of excitation, followed by deep depression (Shell ChemicalCorporation, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 309). When the liquid is appliedto the skin, mild to moderate irritation occurs, although skin absorptiondoes not. At high concentrations, hexylene glycol vapors evoke a strongsensory response: a 5-minute exposure at 1000 ppm produced eye irritationand throat and respiratory discomfort. At concentrations of 50 ppm for15 minutes, slight eye irritation is reported (ACGIH 1986, p. 309).  OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 25 ppm for hexylene glycol to minimizethe risk of neuropathy and irritation that may occur as a result of evenbrief excursions at the high concentrations permitted in the absence ofany OSHA limit. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willsubstantially reduce this significant risk. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a new limit for hexylene glycol.

No. 1206 </ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for hydrogen bromide is 3 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH recommends the same 3 ppm value as a ceiling limit not to be exceededat any time during the working day. Hydrogen bromide (HBr) is a colorless,corrosive, non-flammable gas with an acrid odor.  Animal studies have demonstrated that hydrogen bromide has a considerablyhigher acute toxicity than hydrogen chloride (HCl) in mice and a somewhathigher acute toxicity than this chemical in rats (NIOSH 1977). In mice,the LC<T2>50</T2>is 800 ppm HBr in air for 60 minutes (and 2500 HCl in air for30 minutes); in rats, the LC<T2>50</T2>is 2800 ppm HBr in air for 60 minutes (and 5000 ppm HCl in airfor 30 minutes).  The chief toxic effect of hydrogen bromide in humans is primary irritationof the nose and throat. Irritation begins within several minutes at levelsbetween 3 and 6 ppm. At 2 ppm, the odor of HBr is detectable, but no irritationis experienced (Connecticut State Department of Health, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 312). No chronic effects have been associated with exposure tohydrogen bromide.  Based on evidence that hydrogen bromide is a primary irritant without knownchronic toxicity, OSHA is proposing a 3-ppm ceiling for this substance.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect againstthe risk of primary irritation to which workers can be exposed at the currentPEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revisionto this level.

Hydrogen fluoride is a fuming, colorless liquid;at temperatues above 19anddegrees;C (66anddegrees;F), it becomes a colorlessgas.  Guinea pigs and rabbits survived 40 ppm for 41 hours, but exposure to 300ppm for 2 hours or more was fatal (Machle, Thamann, Kitzmiller, and Cholak1934). Animals exposed to 3 ppm hydrogen fluoride for 30 days showed noadverse effects (Ronzani 1909). Stokinger and co-workers (1949) reportedthat animals repeatedly exposed to 7 ppm on a daily basis exhibited mildrespiratory tract irritation. One study by Largent (1961) demonstratedkidney, liver, and lung damage in laboratory animals repeatedly exposedto 17 ppm hydrogen fluoride. At 8.6 ppm, the pathologic changes seen inexposed animals were minor, except for lung damage in one dog (Largent1961).   In studies with humans, Largent (1960, 1961) reported that volunteers exposedrepeatedly to concentrations of hydrogen fluoride as high as 4.7 ppm for6 hours/day for 10 to 50 days experienced irritation and burning of theeyes and nose, in addition to reddening of the skin, at concentrationsabove 3 ppm. Industrial experience has shown that direct contact of theskin with hydrogen fluoride results in severe burns that may have delayedonset but later develop into ulcers that eventually scar (Patty 1981).A report by Eagers (1969) described several industrial accidents in whichworkers died in a matter of hours after accidential splashing from rupturedcontainers of hydrogen fluoride (the cause of death was respiratory failureand cardiac arrest). Kleinfeld (1965) reported a fatal case of hydrogenfluoride poisoning that caused death from pulmonary edema.  NIOSH (1976) cites numerous studies that consistently show that long-termoccupational exposures to hydrogen fluoride lead to fluorosis in workers.The NIOSH limit is based in part on a study by Derryberry, Bartholomew,and Fleming (1963) showing that the threshold limit for minimal increasesin bone density caused by fluoride (fluorosis) is below 4.3 ppm of hydrogenfluoride.  The Agency is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 3 ppm and a 6-ppm 15-minuteceiling for hydrogen fluoride. These are the current NIOSH-recommendedlimits for this substance. OSHA preliminarily concludes that both a TWAand a STEL are required to protect exposed workers from the risk of fluorosis,eye burning, and skin and upper respiratory tract irritation potentiallyassociated with exposure at the levels permitted by the TWA alone. TheAgency believes that these limits will substantially reduce these risks.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor hydrogen fluoride.

In guinea pigs, directcontact with HPA caused severe eye burns and skin corrosion and sensitizedsome of the experimental animals. Rats exposed to a concentration 650 ppmHPA in air for 7 hours did not die. Longer-term inhalation studies (30days for 2 hours/day/6 days/week) in rats, dogs, rabbits, and mice resultedin some irritation at 5 ppm (Dow Chemical Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 320).

Theacute intravenous dose of ferric chloride that is lethal to rabbits isabout 7.2 mg/kg (Drinker, Warren, and Page 1935). The salts are also consideredirritants to the respiratory tract when inhaled as dusts and mists (Drinkerand Nelson 1944). Stewart and Faulds (1934) described the ferric saltsas skin irritants. The oral toxicities of iron salts are considered tobe moderate to low, and marked gastrointestinal irritation results fromingestion (U.S. Dept. of Labor 1941); 30 grams is the estimated fatal dosefor humans (Smyth 1956).  OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3, as iron, for the solublesalts of iron.

In humans, exposure to 200 ppm isoproplyacetate caused eye irritation, with nose and throat irritation occurringat higher concentrations (Silverman, Schulte, and First 1946). Data showthat isopropyl acetate is more similar to ethyl acetate than to n-propylacetate in its toxic-effects (von Oettingen 1960).OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 250 ppm and a STEL of 310 ppm for isopropylacetate.

In addition, it has narcotic,irritative, and acute toxic effects at higher concentrations. Weil hasreported that an excess of paranasal sinus cancers has been observed amongworkers manufacturing isopropyl alcohol (1952). It has been establishedthat the cancers associated with isopropyl alcohol manufacture were causedby isopropyl oil and not by isopropyl alcohol itself (NIOSH 1976).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 400 ppm TWA and a STEL of 500 ppm for isopropylalcohol. The short-term limit is being added to reduce the risk of irritationand narcotic effects at the higher short-term concentrations permittedby the TWA alone.

A toxicity data sheet published by Shell Chemical Corporation(cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 361) confirmed 25 ppm as being the maximum comfortlevel. Smyth et al. (1942) reported liver and kidney damage among ratsand guinea pigs exposed to 100 ppm mesityl oxide for 6 weeks; no adverseeffects were reported for animals exposed to 50 ppm. After reviewing thesedata, the ACGIH (1986, p. 361) concluded that the former TLV of 25 ppmshould be reduced to 15 ppm because of the greater systemic toxicity ofmesityl oxide compared to other saturated ketones. NIOSH (1978j), relyingon the same data, recommended a limit of 10 ppm as a 10-hour TWA and notedthat the eye irritation caused by mesityl oxide may be more serious thanthat caused by lower ketones. This belief was based on the observationthat eye irritation generally becomes more severe as the molecular weightof the ketone increases.Studies indicate that eye irritation occurs following exposure to 25 ppmof mesityl oxide, and nasal irritation is experienced at the 50-ppm level.Animal studies show liver and kidney damage in experimental animals exposedto 100 ppm.

NIOSH (1978j) concluded that there was no basisfor revising the 100-ppm OSHA limit; they cited evidence that methyl n-amylketone was likely to be as irritating as 2-pentanone (which has a recommendedlimit of 150 ppm), and therefore the 100-ppm limit was probably sufficientfor methyl n-amyl ketone.  No neurological or histopathological effects were observed at 131 ppm.The ACGIH's 50-ppm TLV applies an additional factor of safety to this no-observed-effectlevel, while the NIOSH REL is based on a judgment hat such a reductionis unnecessary.

Osmium tetroxide is a noncombustible, colorless to paleyellow solid with a disagreeable, chlorine-like odor.Exposure to osmium tetroxide is known to produce ocular effects and respiratoryirritation. In 1933, Brunot reported that rabbits died from pulmonary edemafour days after a 30-minute exposure to osmium tetroxide at 130 mg/m3 orhigher. Visual problems (e.g. delayed lacrimation and ``halo'' effects)were reported by this investigator after a brief exposure to osmium tetroxideat a significantly lower concentration (Brunot 1933). A 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> value of 40 ppm has been reported in rats and mice (NIOSH 1977).Toxic effects to bone marrow have been reported in guinea pigs (Hardy 1974).Industrial experience indicates that concentrations in a precious metalrefining plant ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 mg/m3; intermittent exposures producedsymptoms (sometimes delayed) of lacrimation, vision disturbances, headache,conjunctivitis, and cough (McLaughlin, Milton, and Perry 1946). Complaintsof persistent and severe nose and throat irritation have been reported(Hardy and Hamilton 1974). Fairhall (1949) reported a human fatality resultingfrom inhalation exposure to OsO<T2>4</T2>.

Phosphoricacid is a colorless, odorless solid at temperatures below 21anddegrees;C,but it becomes a viscous, clear liquid at higher temperatures.In humans, there have been reports of respiratory irritation from exposureto phosphorus pentoxide fume at concentrations of between 3.6 and 11.3mg/m3; concentrations of 100 mg/m3 were unendurable except to workers whohad developed a tolerance to the fume over time (Rushing 1957, as citedin the ACGIH 1986, p. 483). The AIHA Hygiene Guide reports that phosphoricacid is less hazardous than nitric or sulfuric acid (1957).To protect unacclimatized workers from the risk of throat irritation, OSHAproposes a TWA limit of 1 mg/m3, with a STEL of 3 mg/m3, for phosphoricacid. The Agency preliminarily concludes that the combined 8-hour TWA andSTEL limit is necessary to reduce this risk of irritation, which has beenshown to occur at levels only slightly above those permitted by the TWAalone.

However, by 1934, the effects of phosphorustrichloride were considered to be 5 to 10 times as intense as those ofhydrolyzed hydrochloric acid (International Labour Office 1934). More recently,Weeks and associates (1964) reported studies in which 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> values of 104 ppm for rats and 50 ppm for guinea pigs wereobtained.OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.2 ppm TWA and a STEL of 0.5 ppm for phosphorustrichloride.

This limit applies to the thermal decompositionproducts of gum rosin soldering flux (3 to 6 percent rosin and 30 to 700percent tin-lead solder)(Lozano and Melvin, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p.514).A 2-week exposure of guinea pigs and rats to these products at averageconcentrations of 0.96 mg/m3 caused reduction in rate of weight gain inmale guinea pigs, abnormal liver-to-body-weight ratios in guinea pigs ofboth sexes, and abnormal heart-to-body-weight ratios in male rats (IndustrialBio-test Lab, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 514). Lungs of the animalsexposed in this same study were hyperemic.In humans, slight bronchial irritation has been reported at 1 mg/m3 (IndustrialBio-test Lab, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 514). Several workers chronicallyexposed to levels as high as 0.15 mg/m3 had to be removed from exposurebecause of intractable upper respiratory tract irritation; when concentrationswere kept below 0.1 mg/m3, such irritation was not reported (Christy 1965,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 514). In a study designed to quantify dose-responselevels for irritation in human volunteers, subjects were exposed for 15minutes to these products at aldehyde concentrations (as formaldehyde,which is the best indirect measure of rosin pyrolysis products) of 0.04to 0.2 mg/m3 (U.S. Public Health Service 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 514). Subjects detected the odor at 0.07 mg/m3, and 80 percent of subjectsreported moderate to severe irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat ata concentration of 0.12 mg/m3 or above. At levels below 0.05 mg/m3, fewerthan 10 percent of subjects experienced irritation. Mucous membrane irritationoccurred in 30 percent of subjects exposed at 0.07 mg/m3. Some subjectsreported severe irritation at 0.1 mg/m3 (U.S. Public Health Service 1965,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 514).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\, measured as formaldehyde,for rosin core solder pyrolysis products. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this limit will protect workers from the risk of eye, skin, and upperrespiratory tract irritation demonstrated to occur at the higher levelspermitted in the absence of any OSHA limit.

The ACGIH reportsthat sodium bisulfite is an eye, skin, and mucous membrane irritant; acuteexposures have resulted in mild eye and respiratory effects (ACGIH 1986,p. 534).  OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit for sodium bisulfite, a level halfthat for the inert dusts, because the Agency has preliminarily concludedthat this limit will protect exposed workers against the risk of eye, skin,and upper respiratory tract irritation potentially associated with exposureto this dust at the uncontrolled levels permitted in the absence of anyOSHA limit.

Sodium hydroxide is a white, deliquescentsolid.  Exposure to sodium hydroxide in the form of a caustic dust irritates theupper respiratory tract any may cause ulceration of the nasal passages(ACGIH 1986, p. 535). NIOSH states that rats exposed to unmeasured concentrationsof sodium hydroxide for 30 minutes per day developed pulmonary damage after2 to 3 months (Dluhos et al. 1969, as cited in NIOSH 1976).  Patty (1977) reported that a concentration of 2 mg/m\3\ sodium hydroxiderepresents a level that is noticeably irritating to exposed workers. Hervinet al.

A study by Lewis (1974, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 535) noted throat irritation or eye watering in thoseemployees exposed briefly to concentrations of 0.24, 0.8, or 1.86 mg/m\3\of sodium hydroxide; only those workers exposed to 0.24 mg/m\3\ showedno irritation.  The Agency preliminarily concludes that a 2-ppm ceiling is required toprotect exposed workers against the risk of eye and upper respiratory irritationthat has been shown to exist at the current 2-mg/m\3\ TWA.

A 2-year study at the Dow Chemical Company (1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 535), in which rats ingested 0.215 percent sodium metabisulfite, demonstratedno adverse effects in the rats. If the results of this study are extrapolatedto humans, using a safety factor of 10, the equivalent air concentrationwould be 70 mg/m\3\ (Dow Chemical Company 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 535). Other animal studies show a median lethal dose of 192 mg/kg forrabbits and 115 mg/kg for rats when sodium metabisulfite is injected intravenously(NIOSH 1973).

Sulfurmonochloride is an amber, oily, nonflammable, fuming liquid, which hasa penetrating odor.Sulfur monochloride is a primary irritant that affects the upper respiratorytract by releasing hydrochloric acid (HCl) on contact with moisture (Hendersonand Haggard 1943). This same study noted that ``undecomposed vapor [ofsulfur monochloride] might reach the lungs, in which case it would be moretoxic than an equivalent quantity of HCl.'' The ACGIH (1986, p. 545) considersthese data indicative of a far greater acute toxicity for sulfur monochloridethan for hydrochloric acid. Animal toxicity studies revealed that a doseof 150 ppm sulfur monochloride resulted in death to mice exposed for 1minute (Flury and Zernik 1931). Cats exposed to 60 ppm sulfur monochloridefor 15 minutes all died within a few days, but concentrations of 12 ppmfor 15 minutes were tolerated (Henderson and Haggard 1943). A study by Elkins (1959) of workers in the rubber industry found that concentrationsof 2 to 9 ppm sodium monochloride were mildly irritating; however, theconcentrations to which these workers were exposed may have included ahigh proportion of hydrochloric acid. OSHA is proposing a ceiling of 1 ppm for sulfur monochloride because thissubstance is a primary irritant. The Agency preliminarily concludes thatthis limit will protect exposed workers against the risk of primary irritationthat could occur at the current 8-hour TWA limit.

Sulfur pentafluoride is a colorless gas or liquid with a sulfur-dioxide-likeodor. Sulfur pentafluoride's toxic effects include lung congestion and lesions,and pulmonary edema. In a study in which rats were exposed to sulfur pentafluoridefor 16 to 18 hours, levels of 0.1 ppm caused lung irritation, 0.5 ppm resultedin severe pulmonary lesions, and 1 ppm proved fatal (Greenberg and Lester1950). One-hour exposures to 10 ppm sulfur pentalfluoride resulted in diffusehemorrhagic lesions in the lungs of rats, while rats exposed to 1 ppm for1 hour had severe congestion of the lungs. Rats exposed for 1 hour at 0.1ppm showed no effects. Subsequent examination of rats surviving the 10-and 1-ppm exposures revealed that the lungs had returned to normal after24 hours (Greenberg and Lester 1950). Saunders, Shoshkes, De Carlo, andBrown (1953) established that the LD<T2>50</T2> for sulfur pentafluoride in rabbits is 5.8 mg/kg, and thatdeath was due to fulminant pulmonary edema. According to this study, sulfurpentafluoride does not injure the columnar epithelium of the respiratorytract, and exposure is not followed by bronchopneumonia.  OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit for this substance. The 0.01-ppm ceilinghas been selected on the basis of evidence showing that even brief exposuresto 1 ppm caused pulmonary effects in animals; 0.01 ppm provides a marginof safety against such effects.

Thisis the 8-hour TWA limit recommended by the ACGIH, which also has establisheda 15-minute STEL of 250 ppm for tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran is a colorlessliquid with an odor like that of ether. This proposed limit was selected on the basis of extensive data from experimentalanimal studies. Lehmann and Flury (1943) reported irritation of the upperrespiratory tract as well as kidney and liver injury in a number of animalsexposed by inhalation to more than 3000 ppm tetrahydrofuran for 20 days,8 hours daily. Aqueous solutions exceeding a concentration of 20 percenttetrahydrofuran proved irritating to the skin of rabbits. One study (Stoughtonand Robbins 1936) found that amounts in excess of 25,000 ppm were neededto anesthetize dogs. The anesthesia process in these animals showed a delayedinduction period and poor recovery. In other studies with dogs (Zapp, citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 564), 200 ppm tetrahydrofuran in daily, 6-hour inhalationexposures produced an observable effect on the pulse pressure of theseanimals within 3 to 4 weeks; despite an exposure of nine weeks at thisdosage level followed by 3 weeks at nearly twice this concentation, nohistopathologic changes were observed in the critical organs. Studies (Jochmann1962) in which tetrahydrofuran was given orally and peritoneally to a varietyof laboratory animals resulted in both liver and kidney damage; however,some of the effects observed by this author may have been caused by peroridecontamination of the tetrahydrofuran. Oettel (as cited in ACGIH 1986, p.564) observed no kidney or liver damage in cats, rabbits, rats, or miceexposed repeatedly by inhalation to tetrahydrofuran at concentrations of3400 to 17,000 ppm for as long as 6 hours. Technicians involved in the experiment of Stoughton and Robbins (describedabove) experienced severe headaches when conducting these experiments. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 200 ppm and a STEL of 250 ppm for tetrahydrofuran.The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of these limits are requiredto protect workers from the risk of headache and irritation potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance.

Sublethal doses administered repeatedlyto guinea pigs caused liver damage; acute and short-term (15 6-hour exposuresto 70-200 ppm) inhalation studies failed to kill these animals (Gage 1970).In a separate study reported on by Rowe (1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 593), 20 male rats, 4 rabbits, and 2 dogs were exposed at levels of30 or 100 ppm 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 30 exposuresin 44 days. No adverse effects were detectable in exposed animals belongingto 30 species as a result of exposure to 30 ppm, with the exception ofan elevation of urinary porphyrins in the rats at 15 and 30 exposure days.A second inhalation study was performed with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene 7 hours/day,5 days/week for 26 consecutive weeks (Coate, Schoenfisch, Busey, and Lewisn.d.). Thirty rats, 16 rabbits, and 9 monkeys, all males, were exposedat zero, 25, 50, and 100 ppm. Microscopic changes were seen in the parenchymalcells of livers and kidneys of all rats after 4 and 13 weeks of exposureto 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, but no adverse effects were seen in any of theother species.In workers, exposure to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene caused dermal irritation,which may have been attributable to the defatting action of this chemical(Powers, Coate, and Lewis 1975), and in some cases, exposure levels of3 to 5 ppm caused eye and throat irritation (Rowe 1975, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 593).OSHA is proposing a 5-ppm ceiling limit for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers fromthe risk of eye, throat, and dermal irritation to which they can potentiallybe exposed in the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">TRIETHYLAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-44-8; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>3</T2>N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 15 ppm for this colorlessliquid with a strong ammonia-like odor.Exposure to triethlylamine is associated with pulmonary, skin, and eyeirritation and central nervous system effects. Guinea pigs exposed for30 minutes to a concentration of 2,000 ppm triethlylamine survived, butfour of six animals died when exposed to this level for 2 hours; two ofsix guinea pigs died during a 4-hour exposure to a concentration of 1,000ppm, but all survived similar exposures at the 250- and 500-ppm levels(Carpenter, Smyth, and Shaffer 1948). The single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> value in rats is 0.46 g/kg (range: 0.25 to 0.85) (Smyth, Carpenter,and Weil 1951). These investigators also report that triethlylamine readilypenetrated rabbit skin on contact, with an LD<T2>50</T2> value of 0.57 ml/kg (range: 0.36 to 0.90); skin irritationand eye injury were also noted from contact with the liquid. One of thesix rats died from an acute 4-hour inhalation exposure to 1,000 ppm triethlylamine(Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951). Rabbits exposed repeatedly to a levelof 50 ppm exhibited marked irritation of the cornea and of pulmonary tissue(Brieger and Hodes 1951; Carpenter and Smyth 1946). The effects of repeatedtriethlylamine exposure correspond to those of ethylamine and diethylamine(Brieger and Hodes 1951). Triethlylamine was found to inhibit monoamineoxidase activity, resulting in central nervous system stimulation (DeBruin1976).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of15 ppm for triethlylamine. The Agency preliminarily concludes that bothof these limits are required to protect workers against the risk of CNSeffects and acute irritation to the eyes and lungs potentially associatedwith occupational exposure to triethlylamine at elevated levels. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for triethlylamineif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">VANADIUM (V<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2>) DUST</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-62-1; Chemical Formula: V<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

NIOSH (1978m) recommends a 4-ppmceiling limit, measured over a 15-minute period.The basis for the ACGIH-recommended limits is an epidemiologic report byDeese and Joyner (1969) describing 15 years of industrial experience withvinyl acetate production. They reported that vinyl acetate is not a significantirritant at exposure levels of 5 to 10 ppm but causes cough and hoarsenessat around 22 ppm. They also found no evidence of adverse chronic effectsresulting from exposure to 5 to 10 ppm, as determined from medical recordsand examinations. While conducting air sampling for the study, the primaryauthor (Deese) experienced hoarseness at concentrations of 4.2 and 5.7ppm, and eye irritation at 5.7 and 6.8 ppm. Three chemical operators andone technician did not report any subjective responses at these levels.The ACGIH also cited a personal communication from the Mellon Institute(1968) that vinyl acetate concentrations of less than 5 ppm are detectableby odor, although some individuals may detect the odor at concentrationsof 0.5 ppm.NIOSH (1978m) reviewed these data and concluded that the recommended exposurelimit be designed to protect even the most sensitive individuals from sensoryirritant effects. Since the lowest level reported to cause upper respiratorytract irritation was 4.2 ppm (Deese and Joyner 1969), NIOSH recommendedthat workplace exposures not exceed 4 ppm measured over a 15-minute period.The NIOSH REL of 4 ppm (ceiling) relies on a report concerning a singleindividual and provides insufficient information as a basis for standardsetting.The ACGIH recommended TLVs are based on a 15-year epidemiology study thatsuggests that a 10-ppm TWA and 20-ppm STEL will provide protection againstthe risk of irritation associated with exposure to vinyl acetate at higherlevels. Therefore, the Agency proposes this 8-hour TWA and STEL combinationas the revised limits for vinyl acetate. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level.

NIOSH recommends a 10-hour TWA of 75 ppm and a 400-ppm 15-minuteSTEL. VM andamp; P naphtha, also known as ligroin, is a colorless, flammableliquid. A study in which rats and beagles received doses by inhalation of 500 ppmfor 30 hours per week for 13 weeks resulted in no chronic or latent effects(Carpenter et al. 1975). These authors also noted that the acute toxicityof VM andamp; P naphtha for rats and other species was 4 times greater thanthat of rubber solvent naphtha, which has a limit of 400 ppm. Carpenterand associates (1975) also reported on an experiment in which rats lostcoordination and went into convulsions in 15 minutes during exposures tosaturation concentrations at ambient room temperature.

Seven human volunteers exposed to 880 ppm VM andamp; P naphtha for 15 minutesreported upper respirator tract, eye, nose irritation, and olfactory fatigue(ACGIH 1986, p. 631). Elkins (1959) noted one case of a worker, exposedto levels of VM andamp; P naphtha averaging 800 ppm, who developed unspecifiedchronic effects.

Rats and rabbits exposed to a mixture of xylene isomers at a concentrationof 690 ppm for 8 hours daily, six days per week showed no blood abnormalities,but rabbits exposed on the same regimen at 1150 ppm for 55 days showeda decrease in red and white blood cell counts and an increase in plateletcount (Fabre and Truhaut 1954). Studies of workers exposed to xylene revealed headache, fatigue, lassitude,irritability, and gastrointestinal disturbances as the most common symptoms(Gerarde 1960). At unspecified exposure levels, Browning (1965) also notedgastrointestinal disturbances, in addition to kidney, heart, liver, andneurological damage; blood dyscrasias, some of which result in death, werealso reported in these workers. A study by Nelson, Ege, Ross et al. (1943),in which human volunteers were exposed to 200 ppm xylene, found eye, nose,and throat irritation in the subjects at this level of exposure. NIOSH developed a Criteria Document for xylene in 1975, in which the workof Morley and his colleagues (1970) was discussed. These authors observedliver dysfunction and renal impairment in three workers overexposed toxylene (estimated concentration of 10,000 ppm). One of these workers died,but the others recovered slowly. Furniture polishers were reported by Matthaus(1964) to have suffered corneal damage as a result of exposure to xyleneat unknown concentrations. OSHA preliminarily concludes that both a TWA and STEL are necessary toprevent risk of narcosis, blood effects, and irritant effects at the elevatedlevels possible at the current exposure limit.

Zinc chloridefume is white and has an acrid odor. Zinc chloride fume is highly caustic and damages the mucous membranes ofthe nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Exposure to the fumes of zinc chloridemay result in a severe pneumonitis that is caused by irritation of therespiratory tract (Gafafer 1964). One instance in which a worker inhaledzinc chloride fumes resulted in advanced pulmonary fibrosis that endedin death (Milliken, Waugh, and Kadish 1963), and 10 deaths and 25 non-fatalcases of pneumonitis occurred in workers caught in a tunnel when 79 smokegenerators caught fire and generated zinc chloride fumes (Humter 1955).Other studies have shown that zinc chloride exposures cause skin ulceration(Sax 1957). It has also been suggested that zinc chloride exposure mayhave chronic effects (Hamilton and Hardy 1974). In an investigation ofthe adverse effects of zinc chloride fume exposures, Ferry (personal communication1966, as cited in the ACGIH 1986, p. 643) reported that no sensory effectsoccurred when 30 minute exposures were limited to 0.07 and 0.4 mg/m\3\;however, this researcher noted that these levels did corrode metal. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the risk of damage to the eyes, skin,and respiratory tract associated with exposure to zinc chloride fume shouldbe substantially reduced by establishing a STEL and TWA to protect againstelevated short-term and long-term exposures to this substance. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for zincchloride if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk. Preliminary Conclusions OSHA's preliminary finding is that sensory irritation poses an occupationalhealth risk to workers exposed to these substances at the existing hazardouslevels. Among the adverse health consequences of exposure to sensory irritantsare acute breathing difficulty, eye tearing, conjunctivitis, sensitization,persistent coughing, and upper respiratory tract irritation. In additionto the pain and suffering associated with these signs and symptoms, workersexperiencing irritant effects find it difficult if not impossible to concentrateon the job at hand; thus they work less safely and less productively thannon-exposed employees. Reducing exposures from levels that have been associatedwith these effects to levels where such consequences are substantiallyless likely to occur will reduce the risk posed to workers at current levels.The health evidence for these substances forms a reasonable basis for proposingrevised or new limits. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establishnew or revised limits for these sensory irritants if the Agency determinesthat these limits will substantially reduce significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofLiver or Kidney Effects </ITAG>Introduction The liver or kidneys are the primary target organs affected by toxic exposuresto a number of industrial chemicals. In recognition of this target organtoxicity, OSHA is proposing new or revised limits for 17 hepato- or nephrotoxiccompounds (12 hepatotoxins and five nephrotoxins). For these substances,the liver or kidney is probably the organ most sensitive to the effectsof exposure. Thus, establishing permissible exposure limits that are lowenough to prevent toxicity to these target organs generally also protectsother organ systems. Seventeen compounds for which revised limits are being proposed producekidney or liver effects in overexposed individuals. For seven of thesesubstances, OSHA is proposing to lower the PEL, and for one other substance,OSHA is also proposing the adoption of a short-term exposure limit. Forfive liver or kidney toxins, OSHA is proposing a PEL where none formerlyexisted, and in three cases, OSHA proposes to retain the current PEL butto add a STEL where none formerly existed. For four chemicals in this category,NIOSH recommends limits lower than those established by the ACGIH, andfor one of these substances, OSHA proposes adoption of the NIOSH RELs;in three cases, the NIOSH and ACGIH limits are essentially the same. Thesections below discuss liver and kidney toxins separately. Table C4-1 showsthese hepatotoxic substances, their OSHA, ACGIH, and NIOSH limits, andtheir CAS and HS numbers; Table C4-2 provides the same information forthe nephrotoxins in this group. <ITAG tagnum="84">Liver Toxicity </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects Although the precise mechanisms by which these compounds cause liver damageare only partly understood, the development and manifestation of livertoxicity are similar for all of them. In general, liver toxicity is a gradedresponse, i.e., the severity of the lesion is directly proportional tothe intensity/duration of exposure. Although many of the effects causedby exposure to these substances are reversible, some are not. Liver damage is not a single entity; the manner in which it is manifesteddepends on the dose, duration, and particular chemical agent involved.For example, acute exposures may cause lipid to accumulate in the hepatocytes,cellular death, and/or hepatobiliary dysfunction. In contrast, chronicexposures may lead to cirrhotic changes and the development of neoplasms.Fatty accumulation and necrosis can be either localized or widespread,and chemical-induced lesions resulting from chronic exposures can causemarked changes of the entire liver (Plaa 1986). Typically, the earliest and most sensitive indicators of liver toxicityare alterations in biochemical liver functions, such as changes in specificenzyme activities. These may be accompanied by changes in the morphologyof specific organelles in hepatocytes. For example, relatively low dosesof halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as allyl chloride, carbon tetrabromide,and 1,1-dichloroethane, cause an increase in the activity of microsomalmixed function oxidase enzymes. This increase is ordinarily accompaniedby proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 309_311 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Many compounds that damage the liver, such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane,also cause an abnormal accumulation of fat, especially triglycerides, inliver cells. In experimental animals this effect is manifested as an accumulationof microscopic vacuoles in liver cells. In humans, however, the only grosslydetectable manifestation of this effect is increased liver size, whichis an indication of severe fat accumulation in the liver. At sufficiently high doses, most substances that damage the liver causecell death that leads to tissue necrosis or gangrene. This necrosis mayinitially be localized, but at higher or more sustained exposure levelsthe entire liver may be involved. Moderate to severe liver necrosis isusually accompanied by increased concentrations of marker enzymes suchas glutamate-pyruvate transaminase or glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminasein the serum; the detection of these substances in the serum of exposedindividuals can thus be a useful diagnostic tool. Dose-Response Characteristics The development of liver and other organ damage in humans and animals isprogressive; it begins with subcellular changes, progresses to the cellularlevel, and is finally manifested as whole-organ damage. This progressionis related to the intensity/duration of dose; i.e., as dose increases,cellular death becomes widespread and eventually causes liver dysfunction.The extent to which liver damage is reversible follows a similar continuum;since the liver can regenerate, minor cellular damage or transient diseasestates are usually reversible if exposure ceases. However, if exposurecontinues, the capacity of the liver to regenerate is exceeded and permanentdamage results. As is the case for some chemically induced toxic effects, there appearsto be a NOE level below which hepatotoxic effects do not occur.The following paragraphs describe OSHA's preliminary results for all ofthe substances in this group of hepatotoxins and discuss the nature ofthe risk experienced by exposed workers.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALLYL CHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-05-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCH<T2>2</T2>Cl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1011</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for allyl chloride is a 1 ppm (3 mg/m\3\) 8-hour TWA;the ACGIH-recommended TLV-TWA is also 1 ppm, with a 15-minute STEL of 2ppm. NIOSH has recommended a 1 ppm 10-hour TWA and a 3 ppm 15-minute STELfor this substance. Allyl chloride is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant,pungent odor. Studies of animal exposures to allyl chloride indicate that the chemicalis among the most toxic of the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, producingmucous membrane irritation, mild narcosis, and, at higher concentrations,histologic lesions of the lungs and kidneys (Adams, Spencer, and Irish1940). Even single exposures lasting only a few minutes at concentrationsbetween 1 and 100 mg/liter (332 to 32,000) caused mucous membrane irritationin various laboratory animals (Adams, Spencer, and Irish 1940). Furtheranimal studies have confirmed liver and kidney pathology in many species(Torkelson, Wolf, Oyen, et al. 1959) and female rats exhibited kidney pathologyafter exposure to 3 ppm for 6 months. Human exposures to concentrations of 1 to 113 ppm caused abnormal livertest results (Hausler and Lenich 1968). OSHA therefore proposes that botha STEL of 2 ppm and a 1 ppm TWA are required. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that a combined limit is necessary to protect employees fromthe risk of mucous membrane irritation potentially associated with theelevated short-term exposures to allyl chloride currently permitted bythe 8-hour TWA alone. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis forproposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill establish a new limit for allyl chloride if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CARBON TETRABROMIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 558-13-4; Chemical Formula: CBr<T2>4 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1072</ITAG>OSHA's current Z tables have no limits for exposure to carbon tetrabromide.The ACGIH limit is a 0.1 ppm TWA and a 0.3 ppm STEL. Carbon tetrabromide'shepatotoxic effects include both fatty infiltration and necrosis. The 0.1ppm and 0.3 ppm levels were selected based on an observed no-effect levelat 0.1 ppm; this finding derives from a study in which rats were exposedto carbon tetrabromide by inhalation for 7 hours per day, 5 days per weekfor 6 months (Torkelson and Rowe 198l). OSHA believes that controllingworkplace exposures to these levels will prevent adverse effects in exposedworkers. OSHA preliminarily concludes that establishing a limit for thispreviously unregulated chemical will protect workers against the risk ofexperiencing its hepatotoxic effects and will achieve a substantial reductionin this risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for carbon tetrabromide. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">o-CHLOROSTYRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2039-87-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>7</T2>Cl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1089</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for o-chlorostyrene. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 50 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 75 ppm. o-Chlorostyrene is a liquid. In an unpublished report, the Dow Chemical Company (1973) describes theresults of an o-chlorostyrene inhalation study in rats, rabbits, guineapigs, and dogs. Dow exposed the animals to an average concentration of101 ppm for 7 hours daily, 5 days a week, for a total of 130 exposuresin 180 days. No adverse effects were observed in any species in terms ofappearance, growth, behavior, mortality, hematology, BUN, alkaline phosphatase,SGPT, BSP, organ weights, or gross pathology (Dow Chemical Company, unpublishedreport, 1973). Microscopic examination of animal tissue revealed a somewhathigher incidence of pathological liver and kidney changes. There is evidenceindicating that the warning properties of o-chlorostyrene do not permitworkers to recognize concentrations of o-chlorostyrene of 100 ppm. Basedon o-chlorostyrene's structural analogy to styrene, for which short-termexposures of 100 ppm have been demonstrated to produce neuropathic andnarcotic effects (Stewart, Dodd, Baretta, and Schaffer 1968), a short-termlimit is necessary (ACGIH 1986, p. 136). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and a 15-minute STELof 75 ppm for o-chlorostyrene. The Agency preliminarily concludes thatboth of these limits will protect against the risk of narcosis and neuropathyto which workers could potentially be exposed in the absence of any OSHAlimit.

At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a newlimit for o-chlorostyrene if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CYCLOHEXANONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-94-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1108</ITAG>OSHA has a current limit of 50 ppm TWA for cyclohexanone. Both the ACGIHand NIOSH recommend a time-weighted average of 25 ppm, and the ACGIH alsorecommends a skin notation. Cyclohexanone is a white to pale yellow oilyliquid with an odor similar to that of acetone and peppermint. Cyclohexanone has a low order of acute toxicity in animals. A concentrationof 2000 ppm inhaled for 4 hours was lethal to 1 of 6 rats; at 4000 ppm,all of the exposed animals died. In rabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50 </T2>was 1000 mg/kg (Smyth et al. 1969). Rabbits showed marked irritationand some corneal injury when undiluted cyclohexanone was instilled in theeye (Carpenter and Smyth 1946). Guinea pigs exposed to 4000 ppm for 6 hoursshowed narcotic symptoms, lacrimation, salivation, depression of body temperatureand heart rate, and corneal opacity (Specht et al. 1940). Rabbits exhibiteddegenerative changes of the liver and kidneys after 50 daily 6-hour inhalationexposures to 190 ppm (Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller 1943). Exposuresto 309 ppm cyclohexanone on the same regimen caused conjunctival congestion,while exposures to 3000 ppm were lethal to some of the exposed animals(Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller 1943). In humans, Nelson and co-workers(1943) report that irritation caused by exposure to cyclohexanone was intolerableat 50 ppm, however, 25 ppm was not objectionable to most subjects in 3-to 5-minute exposures. OSHA is proposing a 25-ppm 8-hour TWA and a skin notation for cyclohexanone.The Agency preliminarily concludes that these two limits will prevent therisk of respiratory and skin irritation associated with cyclohexanone exposuresat levels below the existing PEL of 50 ppm. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for cvclohexanone if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DIOXANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 123-91-1: Chemical Formula: O(CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1145</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for dioxane is 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skinnotation. NIOSH recommends a 1-ppm 30-minute ceiling for dioxane, and theACGIH has established a 25-ppm TLV-TWA, with a skin notation. The proposed25-ppm PEL reflects new toxicological data for this substance. A 2-yeardrinking water study conducted by the Dow Chemical Company, in which maleand female rats were given water containing 1.0, 0.1, or 0.01 percent dioxane,showed that animals given the highest dose developed liver and nasal tumors,as well as pathological changes in the liver and kidney. Rats in the 0.1-percentgroup showed renal tubular sloughing and hepatocellular degeneration butno significant increase in neoplasms. Because this study demonstrated hepato-and nephrotoxic effects at doses 10 times lower than the dose causing cancerin animals, the ACGIH established the TLV based on dioxane's liver andkidney effects rather than its carcinogenicity. A study by Torkelson etal. (1974) in four species of animals exposed to multiple daily airborneexposures of dioxane at 50 ppm showed no gross or histopathologic organchanges, leading the ACGIH to recommend 25 ppm as an appropriate levelto protect against liver and kidney effects in exposed workers (ACGIH 1986).In this case, the ACGIH is using a safety factor to establish the 8-hourlimit, i.e., is applying a safety factor of 2 to the results of an animalstudy in four species that showed no gross or histopathological changesat 50 ppm.The 25-ppm TLV is based on hepato- and nephrotoxic effects, since the ACGIHevaluation determined that these effects were more severe than the potentialfor carcinogenicity. OSHA does not generally accept such a rationale; however,OSHA is unable to perform the necessary risk assessment to evaluate thequestion of carcinogenicity in time for this rulemaking. The 1-ppm (ceiling)REL is based on cancer potential and appears to represent the ``lowestconcentration reliably measured,'' a criterion that would not satisfy OSHAfeasibility requirements. OSHA therefore proposes that a PEL of 25 ppmTWA, with a skin notation, be adopted at the present time to reduce therisk that currently exists. As future priorities permit, OSHA will considerthe need for a more stringent PEL.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-06-2; Chemical Formula: ClCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>Cl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1168</ITAG>The current OSHA standard for ethylene dichloride is 50 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, a 100-ppm ceiling (maximum duration of 5 minutes in any 3 hours),and a 200-ppm peak; these limits were derived from limits recommended bythe American National Standards Institute in 1969. In 1980, the ACGIH reducedits TLV to 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH (1978) has concluded that ethylenedichloride should be considered a potential human carcinogen and has recommended1-ppm 10-hour TWA and 2-ppm 15-minute short-term limits. Several studiesindicate that the current OSHA PELs are insufficient to protect workersagainst hepatotoxic and other adverse effects. A paper by Kozik (1957)reported that workers generally exposed below 16 ppm but occasionally exposedto levels between 30 and 50 ppm experienced adverse liver and nervous systemeffects. In addition, Brzozowski (1954) reported abnormal changes in theblood of 50 percent of workers (8 of 16) exposed to between 10 and 37 ppmof ethylene dichloride. The ACGIH also cited numerous animal studies thatconsistently show hepatotoxic effects caused by exposure to ethylene dichloride;the ACGIH concluded that ethylene dichloride ``clearly belongs in the groupof hepatotoxic halogenated hydrocarbons'' (ACGIH 1986). Based on thesefindings, the ACGIH (1986) recommended a reduction in the 8-hour TLV-TWAto 10 ppm. In August 1978, NIOSH recommended that exposure to ethylene dichloridebe minimized in response to an NCI bioassay (1978) showing that ethylenedichloride induced liver cancer in both sexes of mice and rats. NIOSH (1978)subsequently recommended a 1-ppm 10-hour TWA and a 2-ppm 15-minute short-termlimit. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the studies of Kozik (1957) and Brzozowski(1954) clearly indicate that a risk of hepatotoxicity, nervous system effects,and hematopoietic effects exists at the current 50-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL.The 10-ppm TLV recommended by the ACGIH does not afford protection at thelevels (10 to 37 ppm) where abnormal blood changes were measured in 50percent of the workers studied. Therefore, OSHA believes it necessary toreduce its current limits for ethylene dichloride to reduce this risk (aswell as to protect against potential carcinogenic effects) and is proposingto revise these limits to 1 ppm as a TWA and 2 ppm as a STEL. The Agency'spreliminary feasibility analysis is based on limited data at these levels;OSHA requests additional feasibility information from the public. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethylenedichloride if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HYDRAZINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 302-01-2; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>N-NH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1205</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for hydrazine is 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with askin notation. The ACGIH (1986) has recommended a TLV-TWA of 0.1 ppm, alsowith a skin notation. Because of its potential carcinogenic hazard, NIOSH(1978a) has recommended that workplace exposure to hydrazine not exceed0.03 ppm as determined by a 2-hour air sample; this level represents thelowest detectable level over this sampling period. A hepatotoxic response in mice and anemia and weight loss in dogs werereported to occur following a 6-month exposure to 1 ppm for 6 hours perday, 5 days per week or to 0.2 ppm continuously (Haun and Kinkead 1973).It was this finding that led the ACGIH to conclude that the former TLVof 1 ppm was too high. The ACGIH has also assigned an A2 designation (suspecthuman carcinogen), based on a study by MacEwen et al. (1979) showing significantincreases in nasal tumors in rats exposed to 1 or 5 ppm hydrazine, in thyroidadenocarcinoma in rats exposed to 5 ppm, and in lung adenoma among miceexposed to 1 ppm. Other studies are cited by NIOSH (1978a) that demonstratethe carcinogenicity of hydrazine in rodents by a variety of dose routes.Because of this evidence, NIOSH has recommended a workplace exposure limitequal to the limit of detection for a 2-hour sample (0.03 ppm). The animal studies conducted by Haun and Kinkead (1973) and by MacEwenet al. (1979) clearly demonstrate that exposure to the current 1 ppm PELpresents a risk of respiratory cancer, liver disease, and adverse bloodeffects; animals exposed to airborne concentrations at the current PELhave exhibited all of these effects. Therefore, OSHA preliminarily concludesthat a reduction in the PEL for hydrazine is warranted to reduce this riskand is proposing to revise its PEL to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with askin notation. The Agency has selected this limit rather than the 0.03-ppmREL recommended by NIOSH because it does not have sufficient feasibilitydata or risk assessment information regarding use of the 0.03-ppm level.Furthermore, the NIOSH REL appears to be based on the sampling and analyticallimits of detection, and OSHA cannot base its limits on such criteria.The Agency believes that the 0.1-ppm limit will control hepatotoxic effectsand reduce potential carcinogenic risk. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for hydrazine if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYLCYCLOHEXANOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 25639-42-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1269</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for methylcyclohexanol.The ACGIH recommends a limit of 50 ppm TWA. Methylcyclohexanol is a colorless,viscous liquid with an aromatic odor. Exposure to methylcyclohexanol produces narcotic effects, liver and kidneyimpairment, and eye and respiratory irritation. Treon, Crutchfield, andKitzmiller (1943) have reported the oral LD<T2>50 </T2>in rabbits to be between 1.25 and 2 g/kg; liver damage wasobserved in surviving animals. Repeated inhalation exposures to the vaporcaused salivation, eye irritation and lethargy in rabbits exposed at 500ppm, but exposures to 230 ppm caused no observable effects. Fifty 6-hourexposures at a level of 120 ppm caused ``barely discernible'' microscopicchanges in the liver and kidney tissue of rabbits (Treon, Crutchfield,and Kitzmiller 1943). In humans, headaches and eye and respiratory irritation have been reportedto occur from prolonged exposure to high concentrations of methycyclohexanol(Fillipi 1914). Smyth (1956) considered an exposure limit of 100 ppm tobe sufficiently low to prevent narcotic effects and, perhaps, significantliver and kidney damage. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm for methylcyclohexanol. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against therisk of narcosis and hepatic and renal effects that potentially existsat the levels permitted by the current 100-ppm limit. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.

Octachloronaphthaleneis a nonflammable, pale yellow, and waxy solid containing 70 percent chlorine.Inhalation toxicity data for octachloronaphthalene fumes or dust are lacking,but exposure to the chloronaphthalenes causes acne-like lesions that itchseverely. Repeated exposure to the fumes of molten chlorinated naphthalenescan cause severe and sometimes fatal systemic poisoning and is especiallydamaging to the liver (Patty 1963). Ingestion studies of cattle have showndifferent toxicities for different naphthalenes, with the toxicity increasingwith the degree of chlorination (Sikes, Wise, and Bridges 1952). However,these data are controverted by another report in which octachloronaphthalenewas found to be less toxic than the hexachloro derivative (Bell 1953).This divergence in the data may be due to differing methods of administration(suspension versus solution) or may reflect the soluble form's greatercapacity for absorption (ACGIH 1986, p. 447). OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA and a STEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\, witha skin notation, for octachloronaphthalene. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this combined limit will protect workers against the risk of dermaleffects and serious liver damage potentially associated with exposure tothis substance at the levels permitted by the 8-hour limit alone. The skinnotation is retained because of octachloronaphthalene's severe dermal effects.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level.

Propylenedichloride is a colorless, flammable, mobile liquid with an odor like thatof chloroform. The primary hazards associated with exposure to propylene dichloride areinhalation toxicity to liver tissue and mild skin and eye irritation. Repeatedinhalation exposures to 1000 ppm have been reported to kill dogs (after24 exposures), guinea pigs (after 22 exposures), and rats (in some casesafter 7 exposures); some animals survived more than 100 7-hour exposures.Necropsy showed severe liver damage; the hepatotoxicity of propylene dichlorideappears to be greater than that of carbon tetrachloride and less than thatof ethylene dichloride (Heppel, Neal, Highman, and Porterfield 1946). Animalsof these same species (rats, dogs, and guinea pigs) survived 128 to 1407-hour exposures to 400 ppm for 5 days/week without histologic effects,while mice died from similar exposures; surviving mice displayed hepatomas(Heppel, Highman, and Peake 1948).

The NIOSH recommendation is that exposure be reduced to thelowest feasible level. One study by Jevey et al. (1957) revealed identifiablyadverse effects on the liver, including hepatitis, in humans exposed toconcentrations of tetrachloroethane ranging from 1.5 to 247 ppm; liverdamage was still evident after exposures were reduced to 15 ppm. An animalstudy by Schmidt et al. (1972) found ``barely detectable'' fatty infiltrationof the liver in rats exposed to 2 ppm tetrachloroethane for 11 months.Based on this evidence, OSHA preliminarily concludes that the current leveldoes not protect against fatty infiltration of the liver and probably doesnot protect against more serious liver damage; these health consequencesclearly pose an occupational risk. OSHA believes that reducing the 8-hourTWA for tetrachloroethane to 1 ppm will substantially reduce the risk posedto workers exposed at the current PEL and thus proposes adoption of a 1-ppm8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. The proposed limit was selected on thebasis of relatively extensive data from health surveys conducted amongoccupationally exposed workers, supplemented by results from experimentalanimal studies. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level.

It is highly irritating to the eyes (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil et al. 1962). Five of six rats exposed to 1000 ppm died after 4-hourexposures. Rats and guinea pigs exposed at 800, 2100, or 5000 ppm for 30minutes showed central nervous system depression, which progressed at thehigher levels to narcosis and convulsions (Lewis, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 602). Several mice exposed for 20 minutes to 5000 ppm died, some aslong as several days later from liver damage. Daily 10-minute exposuresat 2500 ppm for 10 days killed 7 of 10 mice (McOmie and Barnes 1949). Animalsexposed once for 4 hours to 1,2,3-trichloropropane at concentrations of125, 340, 700, or 2150 ppm showed dose-related signs of irritation, whichincluded, at 700 or 2150 ppm, labored respiration, inactivity, and eyeand nose irritation; at autopsy, however, no organ or other damage wasapparent (McOmie and Barnes 1949). Human volunteers found exposure to 1,2,3-trichloropropane objectionablebecause of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, and many found 50ppm an unacceptable level for a full-shift exposure (Silverman, Schulte,and First 1946). Drew and colleagues (1978) noted changes in liver enzymesafter a single 4-hour exposure to 500 ppm, and Russian studies indicatethat morphologic changes and metabolic lesions of the liver, kidney, andlungs occurred in mice exposed continuously to concentrations of 0.007to 0.3 ppm (Siderenko, Tsulaya, Bonashevskaya, and Shaipak 1979; Siderenko,Tsulaya, Koreneveskaya, and Banashevskaya 1976; Tsulaya, Bonashevskaya,Zykova et al. 1977). A National Toxicology Program prechronic study in which rats were gavageddaily with 1,2,3-trichloropropane at 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, and 250 mg/kgbody weight for 120 days showed good survival in all but the highest dosegroup (National Toxicology Program 1983). Statistically significant changesin the liver and kidney, and necrosis and irritation of the nasal passages,occurred in the 63 and 125 mg/kg dose groups. Decreases in the red bloodcell count and hematocrit were seen even in the 16-mg/kg dose group. 1,2,3-Trichloropropanedid not affect sperm count or morphology or testicular weight. The NTPfound this substance to be genetically active in three bioassays. However,Hardin, Bond, Silkov et al. (1981) did not find 1,2,3-trichloropropaneto be fetotoxic or teratogenic. The ACGIH (1986, p. 602) concluded that the most sensitive sex and species,female rats, had a no-adverse-effect level for kidney or liver effectsof 8 mg/kg/day, and extrapolated from this level to humans to establisha TLV-TWA of 10 ppm. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour PEL of 10 ppm and a skin notation for 1,2,3-trichloropropane.The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits are necessary to protectexposed workers against the risks of liver and kidney damage, eye and throatirritation, and systemic toxicity via inhalation or skin absorption thatare potentially associated with exposures to this substance at levels considerablybelow the Agency's current PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for 1,2,3-trichloropropane if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. <ITAG tagnum="84">Kidney Toxicity </ITAG>Introduction Kidney damage is the basis for revising the PELs for five of the compoundsin this group. These compounds, their CAS and HS numbers, and their currentOSHA, ACGIH, and NIOSH limits are shown in Table C4-2. Three of these substanceswill be regulated by OSHA for the first time, and in the other two cases,the 8-hour TWA will be reduced. In one of the latter cases, a STEL willalso be added. Description of the Health Effects The precise mechanism by which these chemicals damage the kidneys is unknown.Typically, these compounds are selectively toxic to cells in the renaltubule, perhaps because impaired transport causes the chemical to collectin these cells. In addition to the excretion of wastes, the kidney playsan important role in the regulation of total body homeostasis. This organregulates extracellular volume, controls electrolyte and acid-base balance,and forms several hormones that control systemic metabolism. Dependingon their particular site of action, nephrotoxicants thus can interferewith the proper excretion of the body's wastes, hydration, electrolyticbalance, metabolism, and the maintenance of the correct acid-base balance.Like the hepatotoxic effects previously described, the least severe lesionscaused by nephrotoxic compounds are graded and reversible. The earliestchanges are usually alterations in the activities of specific enzymes inthe tubular cells. These changes may be accompanied by minor morphologicalalterations of the cells that are visible only with an electron microscope.Higher doses or more sustained exposures are required to cause cellularnecrosis that might be visible with light microscopy. Because of the reservecapacity of the kidneys, a significant degree of tubular cellular necrosismust occur before it is reflected by measurable alterations in kidney function.Thus, indicators of impaired renal function that can be measured in humans,such as proteinuria, glucosuria, and increased BUN, are relatively insensitiveindicators of kidney damage. Other indicators of significant kidney damageinclude increased kidney weight, swelling of the tubular epithelium, fattydegeneration of tubular epithelium, and the presence of tubular casts inthe urine. OSHA is proposing to establish or revise occupational exposure limits forfive nephrotoxic agents. NIOSH has a REL for one of these substances (hexone),and OSHA is currently regulating two chemicals in this group. These limitswere selected based primarily on the results of studies in experimentalanimals. For example, the limit for hexone is based on results from a studyin which rats were continuously exposed by inhalation to 100 or 200 ppmof hexone for 90 days. The lowest effects observed in this study were degenerationand necrosis of the renal tubules, which were associated with the 100 ppmexposures (MacEwen 1971). In a study of effects caused by exposure to ethylsilicate at 88, 50 or 23 ppm, no decrease in kidney weight was seen inrats exposed to this substance 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 90days (Pozzani and Carpenter 1951). OSHA preliminarily concludes that the10-ppm level will provide protection against any nephrotoxic effects, andwill reduce the significant risk associated with exposure to these hazardoussubstances. Dose-Response Characteristics Kidney damage, like liver damage, is progressive; only at earlier stagesare nephrotoxic effects reversible. The toxicity of the kidney-damagingchemicals included in the group for which 0SHA is proposing limits alsoincreases as dose increases. For most nephrotoxins there appears to bea NOEL. Workplace exposures to concentrations of these substances at levelsat or below the proposed limits are unlikely to cause kidney effects inmost workers. OSHA believes that the nephrotoxic risks being protectedagainst are significant at the current PELs for these substances, becausethe PELs are often at levels well above the concentration demonstratedto produce the toxic effect. In addition, for three of the chemicals, therehave previously been no OSHA limits, and workers could therefore be exposedto levels well above the NOEL.<ITAG tagnum="26">1,3-DICHLOROPROPENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 542-75-6; CHEMICAL FORMULA: CHCl=CH_CH<T2>2</T2>Cl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1129</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for 1,3-dichloropropene. The ACGIH has establishedan 8-hour TLV-TWA of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for this straw-coloredclear liquid with a chloroform-like odor. This compound occurs in the formof two isomers, cis and trans. In male and female rats, the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>'s for a 92-percent mixture of the cis and trans isomers of1,3-dichloropropene were 713 and 470 mg/kg, respectively; post mortem examinationshowed liver and kidney damage and, perhaps, evidence of lung injury (Torkelsonand Oyen 1977). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits for a 92-percent undiluted mixture was 504 mg/kg,but a 10-percent solution administered by gavage at a dose of 125 or 250mg/kg was lethal to some of the animals (Torkelson and Oyen 1977). Contactwith the liquid was irritating to the eyes and skin of rabbits (Torkelsonand Oyen 1977).Inhalation exposures to 1,3-dichloropropene vapor concentrations above2700 ppm produced eye and nasal irritation and severe lung, nasal. kidney.and liver damage in rats (Torkels,n and Oyen 1977). Exposure to 1000 ppmcaused eye and nasal irritation, lacrimation, and, if prolonged, unconsciousness;rats exposed to 1000 ppm for 2 hours died, but those exposed for 1 hoursurvived (Torkelson and Oyen 1977). Guinea pigs exposed to 400 ppm fora single 7-hour period died, while rats exposed similarly survived buthad obvious lung con9estion (Torkelson and Oyen 1977). Rats. rabbits, guineapigs, and dogs were exposed 7 hours/day' 5 days/week for 6 months to 1-ppmor 3-ppm concentrations of 1,3-dichloropropene (Torkelson and Oyen 1977).No adverse effects were observed in any of the animals exposed at 1 ppm.Of the animals exposed at 3 ppm, only male rats showed adverse effects;these animals had reversible cloudy swelling of the renal tubular epithelium(Torkelson and Oyen 1977).In humans, acute exposures to 1,3-dichloropropene cause skin. eye. andrespiratory irritation (Torkelson and Oyen 1977). There are no data onthe effects in humans of chronic exposure to this substance. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for1,3-dichloropropene. The A9ency preliminarily concludes that this limitwill protect workers against the risk of eye and mucous membrane irritationand lung, kidney, and liver damage potentially associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.A skin notation is proposed to protect against 1,3-dichloropropene's abilityto be absorbed through the skin. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for 1,3-dichloropropene. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DICYCLOPENTADIENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 77-73-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>12</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

However, Gage (1970)regards approximately 660 ppm as the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats and reports that ten 6-hour daily exposures to DCPDat a concentration of 250 ppm were survived only by three of four rats;when the animals were subjected to a concentration of 100 ppm for 15 similarexposures, all survived (Gage 1970). Other species were less susceptiblethan mice to the effects of DCPD exposure, but they exhibited eye irritation,incoordination, and convulsions preceding death (Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary,and Carpenter 1971).Kinkead and associates (1971) report that rats exposed repeatedly for 10days survived concentrations of 72 or 146 ppm but succumbed at the 332ppm level, with convulsions, lung hemorrhage and blood in the intestines;female rats also suffered hemorrhage of the thymus. Mice similarly exposedsuccumbed at all three concentration levels (Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, andCarpenter 1971). Chronic exposures of 7 hours/day for 89 days producedkidney damage and some pulmonary effects in rats exposed at levels of 35and 74 ppm; a no-effect level for rats was determined to be below 19.7ppm. Dogs exposed at concentrations of 9, 23, or 32 ppm on the same regimenexhibited only minimal effects (Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter1971).Human sensory response tests resulted in findings of mild eye and throatirritation in 7 minutes on exposure to 1 ppm DCPD vapor and olfactory fatiguein 24 minutes; a 30-minute exposure to 5.5 ppm produced no olfactory fatigue(ACGIH 1986, p. 194). Subjective complaints of headache during the first2 months of occupational exposure disappeared during the following 3 monthsof exposure, suggesting a developed tolerance for this substance (ACGIH19B6, p. 194).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 5 ppm TWA for dicyclopentadiene. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against thepotential risk of kidney injury, pulmonary effects, and irritation potentiallyassociated with workplace exposure to DCPD at the levels permitted by theabsence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for dicyclopentadiene. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYL SILICATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-10-4; Chemical Formula: Si(OC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1166</ITAG>OSHA's current permissible exposure limit for ethyl silicate is 100 ppmas an B-hour TWA. The ACGIH recommends a limit of 10 ppm TWA for this colorless.flammable liquid with a faint odor.Ethyl silicate has been reported to cause both irritation and systemictoxicity. In guinea pigs and rats, a 60-minute exposure of 2000 ppm wasreported as the maximal time-concentration that did not cause serious disturbances;500 ppm was the maximal no-effect exposure level for an exposure of severalhours' duration (Smyth and Seaton 1940). Thirty-day exposures to 400 ppmethyl silicate for 7 hours/day caused significant mortality in rats anddamage to the lungs, liver, and kidney in the surviving animals. Exposuresof rats, guinea pigs, and mice to 88, 50, or 23 ppm for 90 days (7 hours/day,5 days/week) resulted only in decreased kidney weights in mice exposedat the 88-ppm level (Pozzani and Carpenter 1951). In another study, Kasper,McCord, and Frederick (1937) showed that animals exposed to 164 ppm ethylsilicate for 17 8-hour days showed less weight gain than did controls.Rowe and associates (1948) reported that three 7-hour exposures at 1000ppm were fatal to 4 of 10 rats; similar exposures to 500 ppm caused pronouncedkidney changes and slight lung irritation. Four to 10 similar exposuresat 250 ppm caused slow weight loss and some lung and renal changes; at125 ppm, slight to moderate kidney damage was observed (Rowe, Spencer,and Bass 1948).Smyth and Seaton (1940) reported that exposure to a concentration of 1200ppm causes lacrimation in humans and that 250 ppm causes eye and nose irritation.OSHA is proposing a PEL of 10 ppm TWA for ethyl silicate. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit is required to protect exposed workers from therisk of renal damage potentially associated with exposures to higher concentrations.OSHA believes that this reduced limit will substantially reduce this risk.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor ethyl silicate. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEXACHLOROBUTADIENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 87-68-3; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>2</T2>=CCl-CCl=CCl<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1195</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD). The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.02 ppm with a skin notation, and classifies this substanceas a suspected human carcinogen (A2). Hexachlorobutadiene is a heavy, clearliquid. Hexachlorobutadiene has a moderate-to-high acute oral toxicity. The LD<T2>50</T2>s reported for mice, rats, and guinea pigs are 87, 350, and90 mg/kg, respectively (Murzakev 1964). Gulko and co-workers reported LD<T2>50 </T2>values of 116 mg/kg for mice and 270 mg/kg for rats (Gulko,Zimina, and Shroit 1965). Skin absorption has been demonstrated in rabbits(Kociba et al. 1977). The dose range reported to be lethal via skin absorptionis comparable to that which is lethal via the oral administration route.A single exposure of 133 to 150 ppm via inhalation has been fatal in ratswhen the exposure lasts for 4 to 7 hours. All rats survived exposures at161 ppm for 0.88 hour or 34 ppm for 3.3 hours; similar exposure of guineapigs and cats to the same concentrations resulted in the death of mostanimals (Kociba et al. 1977). Another inhalation study in rats showed eyeand nose irritation, respiratory difficulty, and damage to kidney tissueand adrenal cortex after two 4-hour exposures at 250 ppm; twelve 6-hourexposures to 100 ppm caused eye and nose irritation, respiratory difficulty,weight loss, anemia in the female animals, and kidney and adrenal damage;fifteen 6-hour exposures at 25 ppm caused retarded weight gain in females,respiratory difficulty, and kidney damage; fifteen 6-hour exposures at10 ppm caused retarded weight gain in females but no systemic injury; andfifteen 6-hour exposures at 5 ppm resulted in no adverse effects (Gage1970). Reproductive studies in male and female rats demonstrated multiple toxicologicaleffects, including kidney damage in both sexes and increased liver weightin males, at the high dose level of 20 mg/kg/day. Dietary administrationof 20, 2, or 0.2 mg/kg daily had no effect on conception percentages, gestationalsurvival, neonatal survival, neonatal sex ratio, neonatal morphology, orneonatal body weights (except for the high-dose neonates) (Schwetz et al.1977). Results of lifetime dietary studies suggest that the no effect levelfor hexachlorobutadiene in rats is 0.2 mg/kg/day, that a clear dose-responserelationship exists for HCBD-induced toxicity affecting primarily the kidney,and that carcinogenic effects (i.e., renal neoplasms) result from ingestionof 20 mg/kg/day (Kociba et al. 1977). These authors also reported thatHCBD-induced neoplasms occur only at HCBD doses higher than those causingdiscernible renal injury. The ACGIH states that ``HCBD would seem to qualifyas a carcinogen of intermediate potency'' (ACGIH 1986, p. 299). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.02 ppm, with a skin notation,for this hazardous substance. Assuming a 10-m\3\ per day breathing volumeper 8-hour workshift and a 70-kg body weight for humans, this limit correspondsto a daily intake of approximately 0.03 mg/kg. This is about 10 times belowthe observed no-effect level in rats fed hexachlorobutadiene. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that the proposed limit of 0.02 ppm will protectworkers exposed to HCBD from the risks of eye, skin, and pulmonary irritation,kidney damage, and renal neoplasms potentially associated with exposureto HCBD at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. In addition,the proposed skin notation will prevent the systemic toxicities that canoccur as a result of dermal absorption of HCBD. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for hexachlorobutadiene.

No. 1203</ITAG>OSHA's current 8-hour TWA standard for methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is100 ppm. The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 75 ppm for this substance. NIOSH recommends a TWA of 50 ppm forMIBK, which is a clear liquid with a characteristic odor. A 4-hour exposure to 4000 ppm killed all exposed rats, but a similar exposureto 2000 ppm was not fatal to these animals (Smyth et al. 1951). Guineapigs exposed to a MIBK concentration of 10,000 ppm immediately showed signsof irritation (Specht et al. 1940, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 402). MacEwen, Vernst, and Haun (1971) exposed rats, mice, dogs, and monkeysto 100 or 200 ppm MIBK for two weeks and noted no signs of intoxication;however, rats exposed to 100 ppm had heavier kidneys and higher kidney-to-body-weightratios, and, at 200 ppm, livers were heavier as well. Postmortem examinationrevealed nephrosis of the proximal tubules.The same authors (MacEwen, Vernst, and Haun 1971), exposed rhesus monkeys,dogs, and rats continuously for 90 days to MIBK concentrations of 100 ppm.These authors observed no significant changes in clinical chemistry orblood test results, although the rats had heavier kidneys and livers, reversiblehyaline dioplet degeneration of the proximal tubules of the kidneys, andsome necrosis of the tubules. Silverman and co-workers (1946) determined that the maximum dose of MIBKtolerable to human volunteers for 8 hours was 100 ppm; at 200 ppm, thesesubjects found the odor of MIBK objectionable and the vapor irritating.Linair and co-workers (1964) reported that more than half of all workersexposed to 500 ppm of MIBK for 20 to 30 minutes daily, and perhaps to 80ppm for the remainder of the shift, experienced weakness, loss of appetite,headache, burning eyes, nausea, vomiting, and sore throat; several of theseworkers also reported insomnia, somnolence, heartburn, and intestinal pain.Some workers had enlarged livers and others had colitis. Clinical testresults on these workers were normal. In a follow-up study on this same group of centrifuge operation workers,Armeli and co-workers (1968) determined that reduction of MIBK levels duringthe 15 to 30 minutes of centrifuge operation to 100 to 105 ppm, and, forthe remainder of the shift, to 50 ppm, had also significantly reduced thesymptomatology reported earlier by these workers. However, liver enlargementpersisted in two workers, and a few workers continued to report gastrointestinaland nervous system effects. Elkins (1959) noted that exposure to 100 ppm during boot waterproofingoperations caused workers to develop headache and nausea; another similarlyexposed group experienced only irritation at 100 ppm. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 75 ppmfor methyl isobutyl ketone. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits will work together to protect workers from the risk of headache,nausea, and irritation, as well as potential kidney and liver effects,determined to be associated with exposures to the levels permitted at a100-ppm TWA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for methyl isobutyl ketone if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk. Preliminary Conclusion for Both Liver and Kidney Toxins The health effects associated with occupational exposure to the hepato-and nephrotoxins shown in Tables C4-1 and C4-2 can be acute or chronic,reversible or irreversible, temporarily disabling or threatening to life.Workers experiencing chemically induced hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effectsmay have enlarged livers, high blood pressure, hormonal imbalances, and/ororgan necrosis. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposingnew or revised limits for the substances in this section. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish new or revised limits if the Agencydetermines that significant risk will be thereby reduced. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofOcular Effects </ITAG>Introduction Five of the chemicals for which OSHA is proposing limits have the potentialto cause serious ocular effects. Certain chemicals in this group are alsosensory irritants and are distinguished from other such irritants by theirability to cause permanent damage to the corneas, lenses, or optic nervesof exposed individuals. Table C5-1 lists these five chemicals, along with OSHA's current PEL, theNIOSH REL, the ACGIH TLV, and the chemical's CAS number and HS number.In two cases, the proposed 8-hour PELs correspond to the current ACGIHTLV-TWAs for these substances. For one substance, methyl alcohol, OSHAis proposing to retain the existing 8-hour TWA and to add a STEL. In thecase of methyl silicate, the Agency proposes to add an 8-hour PEL wherenone formerly existed. For N-ethylmorpholine, the PEL is being reducedfrom 20 to 5 ppm. In two instances, the ACGIH and NIOSH limits differ in some respects. Formethyl alcohol, the ACGIH recommends a 200-ppm TWA and a 250-ppm STEL,while NIOSH recommends a 200-ppm TWA and an 800-ppm STEL (15-minute ceiling).For hydrogen sulfide, the ACGIH has established both a STEL and a TWA,while NIOSH recommends only a 10-minute STEL. These differences, and theAgency's decision with regard to them, are discussed further below. Description of the Health Effects Damage to the eye caused by exposure to the five chemicals in this groupcan occur in the form of corneal, lens, retinal, ganglion cell layer, oroptic nerve effects. Depending on the severity of the exposure, individualsusceptibility, and the particular chemical involved, this damage may betransient, temporarily disabling, or permanently blinding. <T3>Corneal effects. </T3>The cornea and conjunctiva are the outer surfacesof the eye and are thus directly exposed to external insults. Since thecornea must maintain transparency to remain functional, scar formationafter injury to the cornea can destroy visual function completely. Recentevidence suggests that the transparency of the cornea is maintained bythin inner and outer boundary layers and that the death of these layersleads to loss of transparency (Potts 1986). The corneal epithelium (outerlayer) sometimes regenerates, depending on the depth of the burn or insultand the nature of the toxicant. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 342 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Some chemicals, including methyl silicate, produce painful corneal epithelialinjuries that have a delayed symptom onset. These substances can continueto cause pain and loss of corneal epithelial cells for several hours afterexposure. Typically, there is no discomfort during the actual exposure,but several hours later, the eyes begin to burn, vision blurs, and conjunctivalhyperemia, tearing, photophobia, and squinting occur (Grant 1986). Possiblemechanisms are enzyme inhibition, denaturing of other proteins, alterationof the DNA, and interference with the mitotic process, so that after aperiod of exposure, the affected cells die. Although the damaged epitheliummay regenerate after this type of injury, the damage can also involve thecorneal stroma and endothelium, leading to scarring, vascularization, opacity,and loss of vision. These substances' poor warning properties, i.e., absenceof immediate effect, make the establishment of protective exposure limitsespecially critical for these chemicals. Exposure to some chemical vapors produces painless edema of the cornealepithelium, which is accompanied by the delayed onset of visual haloes.A chemical that produces these effects is N-ethylmorpholine, a catalystused to manufacture urethane foam. Painless edema generally occurs in workerswho have been exposed for several hours to levels that do not produce discomfortduring the exposure itself. The visual effect produced by such exposuresconsists of the appearance of colored haloes around lights, an effect thatis caused by the diffraction of light through the swollen epithelial cellsof the eye. Visual haloes are severely distracting and restrict activitysubstantially, and the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood(Grant 1986). <T3>Lens effects. </T3>The lens is a transparent, avascular tissue surroundedby a thin, collagenous capsule. The major portion of the lens is composedof long, thin fibers that form closely packed, onion-like layers. Transparencyis dependent on several factors: A highly ordered cellular arrangement;fiber size, shape, and uniformity; molecular structure; and regularityof fiber packing (Potts 1986). Interference with lens metabolism, transportacross cell boundaries, or the integrity of the lens capsule itself cancause a loss of lens transparency and lead to decreased visual acuity (Potts1986). All such changes in lens transparency are referred to as cataracts.<T3>Retinal effects. </T3>The retina is a compact neural structure thatis responsible for converting the ocular light image to neural impulses.Because the retina is an internal structure, it is not generally affectedby exposure to dust, splashes of liquids, or vapors. However, exposureto certain internally absorbed substances, such as methyl alcohol, maycause changes or lesions in the retina, including retinal edema or hemorrhage.Exposure to a few of these substances can cause acute narrowing of theretinal arteries themselves, which can lead, in turn, to damage to theoptic nerve and loss of vision. <T3>Effects on ganglion cell layer and optic nerve. </T3>Below the retinalsurface layer lies the ganglion cell layer, which is composed of the cellbodies of neurons that extend to the midbrain via the optic nerve. Ganglioncells may be damaged directly when the chemical acts on the cell bodiesthemselves or secondarily when the toxin destroys the optic nerve. Dependingon the severity of the exposure, loss of visual acuity or vision may ensue.<T3>Dose-Response Relationships and Ocular Effects. </T3>For most of thechemicals on this list, limits have been established on the basis of healthsurveys and case reports of occupationally exposed populations. These studiesindicate that exposures to concentrations of these substances at levelsabove the NOE level cause damage or pain to the eyes of exposed workers.In some cases only limited human data are available, and evidence fromanimal studies or knowledge of a chemical's structural analogy to anotherchemical known to have ocular effects provides the basis for proposingthe limit. Animal models are generally good predictors of ocular effectsin humans because the eyes of rodents, especially those of guinea pigsand rabbits, closely resemble human eyes. Thus, animal studies of the effectsof acid burns on the eye can be relied on to predict accurately how thechemicals that produce these effects in animals will behave in workersexposed in industrial situations. OSHA's preliminary findings and the availabletoxicologic data for the chemicals in this group are described below.<ITAG tagnum="26">N-ETHYLMORPHOLINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-74-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>13</T2>NO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1172</ITAG>The current OSHA 8-hour TWA PEL is 20 ppm, and the ACGIH TLV is an 8-hourTWA of 5 ppm: both limits have skin notations. NIOSH has no REL for ethylmorpholine.N-Ethylmorpholine is a severe eye irritant. Prolonged exposure to fairlylow concentrations of ethylmorpholine causes corneal edema, blue-gray vision,and colored haloes. Typically, vision becomes misty and haloes appear afew hours after workers have been exposed to vapors for a period of hours.Distortion of vision can occur even at levels considerably lower than thosethat cause irritation (Mastromatteo 1965). Reversible corneal edema has been observed in workers exposed to 40 ppmor more of ethylmorpholine for several hours (Dernehl 1966). Workers routinelyexposed to 3 to 4 ppm and never exposed to concentrations above 11 ppmcomplained of haloes and foggy vision as well as drowsiness (ACGIH 1987).The irritant effects of N-ethylmorpholine were also seen in a controlled-exposure experiment on volunteer subjects. Ten subjects exposed for 2.5minutes to 100 ppm experienced irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat;those exposed for 2.5 minutes to 50 ppm experienced slight irritation;and no irritation was reported after exposure for 2.5 minutes to 25 ppm(ACGIH 1986). OSHA's current 20-ppm PEL for N-ethylmorpholine does not protect exposedworkers against the occurrence of corneal edema, workers are especiallylikely not to be aware of the danger of exposure to N-ethylmorpholine becausecorneal edema is painless as it is developing and has a delayed onset,and thus no warning occurs during the actual exposure itself. In addition,the effects on visual function of repeatedly exposing the eyes to episodesof corneal edema are not known. OSHA therefore preliminarily concludesthat reducing the PEL to 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA (with a skin notation)is necessary to improve the protection of occupationally exposed individualsfrom ethylmorpholine's injurious effects on the eyes. This reduction inthe PEL will reduce the risk of corneal edema, visual distraction, andimpaired vision associated with exposure to this substance. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for N-ethylmorpholine.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HYDROGEN SULFIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-06-4; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>S </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1209</ITAG>OSHA's current limits (based on an earlier ANSI standard) for hydrogensulfide are a 20-ppm STEL (10-minute maximum duration) and a 50-ppm peaklimit. The ACGIH has established a TLV of 10 ppm TWA and a 5-ppm STEL forhydrogen sulfide. NIOSH has recommended a 10-minute limit of 10 ppm. Hydrogensulfide is widely used as an analytical reagent and in the manufactureof heavy water. However, occupational exposure to hydrogen sulfide occursmost frequently when it is encountered in natural oil or gas deposits oras a byproduct in chemical reactions. The ACGIH cites several reports (Brieger 1964; Kranenburg and Kessner 1941;Elkins 1950; Masure 1963) of the occurrence of adverse ocular effects,including conjunctivitis, associated with exposure to 20 ppm or less ofhydrogen sulfide. The ACGIH also cites a publication by Poda (1966), whoreported that the voluntary adoption of 10 ppm as a limit in two heavy-waterplants proved to be a satisfactory limit. Based on this information, theACGIH recommended 10 ppm as a TLV-TWA and 15 ppm as a TLV-STEL. In recommending a 10-minute limit of 10 ppm for hydrogen sulfide, NIOSHalso cited the Poda (1966) report. In addition, NIOSH relied on many ofthe same studies cited by the ACGIH (1986) to demonstrate the occurrenceof ocular damage and eye irritation at exposure levels below 20 ppm. Indiscussing the ocular effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure, NIOSH (1977i)points out that the effects are predominately acute and, although thereare no reports of permanent eye damage, recovery may require several days'absence from work. NIOSH also cites a study done by Flury and Zernik (1931)that reported a case of enduring conjunctivitis in a person exposed to10 to 15 ppm hydrogen sulfide for 6 hours. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the current 20-ppm (10-minute) short-termlimit and 50-ppm peak limit are inadequate to ensure worker protectionagainst the adverse ocular effects associated with exposure to concentrationsof less than 20 ppm hydrogen sulfide, as reported in several studies. OSHAbelieves that the eye irritation and conjunctivitis associated with suchexposures represent a risk to workers, who will be forced to seek medicaltreatment after exposure and who may also be absent from work. OSHA isproposing to reduce its current limits for hydrogen sulfide to 10 ppm asa TWA and 15 ppm as a STEL. The limit being proposed by OSHA for hydrogensulfide is a level that has been found to be effective in preventing sucheffects in the workplace (Poda 1966). Promulgating the proposed limit forhydrogen sulfide will substantially reduce the risk of adverse ocular effectsthat can occur as a consequence of exposure at the Agency's existing Ztable limits. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for hydrogen sulfide if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYL ALCOHOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-56-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>H </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1252</ITAG>The OSHA 8-hour TWA limit for methyl alcohol is 200 ppm. The ACGIH hasestablished a 200-ppm TWA and a 250-ppm STEL for methyl alcohol, with askin notation. NIOSH recommends the same 8-hour limit as the ACGIH, butwould supplement the TWA with an 800-ppm rather than a 250-ppm STEL (15-minuteceiling). Methyl alcohol is a widely used industrial solvent whose principaltoxic effects are headaches, loss of vision, conjunctivitis, and otheradverse effects. Workers exposed to concentrations of methyl alcohol between 200 and 375ppm experience severe recurrent headaches, and at levels between 1200 and8300 ppm, studies by Kingsley and Hirsch (1954; 1955) report that theirvisual capacity is diminished. The ACGIH recommends the addition of a 250-ppmSTEL because it believes that an 8-hour PEL of 200 ppm does not ensurethat workers may not be exposed to short-term peaks above the 200 to 375ppm levels that have been shown to cause severe recurrent headaches inexposed workers. OSHA believes that observance of the current 200-ppm TWA, supplementedby the proposed STEL of 250 ppm and a skin notation, will eliminate orsubstantially reduce the risk of severe and recurring headaches and othersymptoms potentially associated with industrial exposures to methyl alcoholat such peaks. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for methyl alcohol if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYL SILICATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 681-84-5; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>O)<T2>4</T2>Si </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1266</ITAG>Methyl silicate damages the cornea and produces a delayed response. Thecurrent Z tables have no limit for methyl silicate. The ACGIH recommendsa 1 ppm 8-hour TWA TLV, and NIOSH has no REL for this substance. In many cases of methyl silicate exposure, the eyes recover completely,but there are reports of damage to the deep layers of the cornea that causedpermanent opacification and, in one worker, loss of the vision in one eye(Grant 1986). It is estimated that exposing humans to methyl silicate atconcentrations of 200 to 300 ppm for 15 minutes will produce minimal lesions,and that exposure to 1000 ppm for this period will produce injury requiringhospitalization (ACGIH 1986). Rabbits exposed to 1000 ppm of methyl silicate in dry air experienced delayedeye burns (ACGIH 1986). Exposure of these animals to approximately 15,000ppm for 5 minutes caused eye burns, but exposure to this level for 4 minutescaused no appreciable effect. Guinea pigs, which are the test animals withthe most sensitive eyes, showed maximum no-effect levels of 135 ppm for15 minutes, 90 ppm for 1 hour, and 20 ppm for eight 1-hour periods. Thelatency period for ocular changes was 16 hours for serious effects andup to 3 days for mild involvement (ACGIH 1986). The ACGIH applied a safetyfactor to the NOEL observed in guinea pigs and established a 1-ppm TWA.OSHA is proposing a 1-ppm 8-hour limit to reduce the risk of potentiallysevere ocular effects associated with the uncontrolled occupational exposurescurrently permitted in the workplace. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for methyl silicate. At the time of thefinal rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines thatthis limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">NAPHTHALENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 91-20-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>8</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1282</ITAG>OSHA's current exposure limit for naphthalene is 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH has established a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 15-ppm 15-minute STELfor this substance, which occurs as a colorless-to-brown solid and hasthe odor of mothballs. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 1760 mg/kg (Flury and Zernik 1931). In humans, the inhalation of naphthalene vapor causes headache, loss ofappetite, and nausea (Flury and Zernik 1931; Patty 1949). These authorsalso report that exposure causes optical neuritis, corneal damage, andkidney injury. Eight of 21 workers exposed for 5 years to unspecified levelsof naphthalene developed opacities of the lens of the eye (Ghetti and Mariani1956). Ingestion of large amounts of naphthalene causes severe hemolyticanemia and hemoglobinuria (Stokinger and Mountain 1963). The lethal dose in humans has been reported as 50 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977). Concentrationssomewhat above 15 ppm are reported to cause marked eye irritation (Robbins1951). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 15 ppmfor naphthalene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits willprotect workers from the risks of eye irritation and serious ocular effectspotentially associated with exposure to the levels permitted by an 8-hourlimit alone. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for naphthalene. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk. Preliminary Conclusions OSHA believes that adoption of the limits being proposed for this groupof chemicals, which have the potential to cause adverse ocular effectsranging from transient discomfort to permanent blindness, will substantiallyreduce the risk of visual impairment associated with exposure to thesesubstances. The toxicological bases for the proposed limits include evidencederived from occupationally exposed workers, results obtained in animalmodels that have been shown to be excellent predictors of human responses,and, in a few instances, evidence that a chemical having a similar chemicalstructure produces serious adverse ocular effects. The risks being protectedagainst have serious consequences, both in terms of the health and functionalcapacity of the exposed workers themselves and the safety and well-beingof these workers and their co-workers. The available health evidence for the substances described in this sectionforms a reasonable basis for proposing the revision or addition of theselimits. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate revised ornew limits for these substances if the Agency determines that these limitswill reduce significant risk. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofRespiratory Effects </ITAG>Introduction Limits are being proposed for a total of 32 substances or materials forwhich exposure has been shown to cause adverse respiratory effects. Thechemicals in this group cause acute pulmonary edema, alveolar damage, orchronic respiratory damage through the general mechanisms of cellular damageor fibrosis. At sufficient doses, these effects can be permanent, disabling,and life-threatening. Some of the materials in this group are composites of naturally occurringminerals, and for these, the Agency is proposing limits based on the mosthazardous component. For several materials (coal dust, crystalline tripoli,silica, and graphite), OSHA proposes that the TWA be measured as the respirablequartz fraction of the dust, because it is exposure to this fraction thatpresents the greatest risk to exposed workers. In cases where only a portionof the dust is in the form of a respirable dust, OSHA is proposing limitsthat are to be measured as the respirable fraction rather than as totaldust. Table C6-1 lists the 32 substances in this group, along with the currentOSHA PELs, ACGIH TLVs, NIOSH RELs, CAS numbers, and OSHA HS numbers. Thereis no current OSHA PEL for ten of these substances. For 15 substances,OSHA is proposing to replace its existing TWA-PELs with different TWA-PELs.For one substance, OSHA is proposing to establish a ceiling limit to replacean existing 8-hour TWA, and for three substances, a lower TWA and a newSTEL are proposed. In three instances, OSHA is proposing to establish aSTEL to augment its current TWA-PELs. NIOSH has recommended limits for7 substances in this group. Description of the Health Effects The respiratory system is a major route of occupational exposure for toxicsubstances. Because of the vital nature of pulmonary function, respiratorytoxicants present a serious health hazard both from acute and chronic exposures.Acute respiratory disease can be life threatening; however, in most cases,such severe effects are associated only with high exposure levels. (Oneexception to this general rule is exposure to chemicals that can causeallergic sensitization reactions that lead, in turn, to anaphylactic shock;these substances are discussed in a different section of this preambledescribing sensitization reactions.)<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 354-357</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Chronic pulmonary disease can result from long-term exposure to respiratorytoxicants and is potentially crippling because it greatly reduces the qualityof life and the productivity of its victims. In addition, the onset ofrespiratory disease can be insidious, because it may be indicated onlyby the gradual development of a few nonspecific signs (Petersdorf et al.1983). The difficulties of detecting irreversible respiratory effects complicatethe prevention of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary function can be evaluatedwith a variety of tests, including measurements of the vital capacity andof the resting and forced expiratory volumes. However, certain conditions,including emphysema and fibrosis, are difficult to diagnose even with suchtests. In addition, these same diseases often continue to progress evenafter the affected individual has recognized the problem and obtained medicalassistance. Furthermore, these diseases may continue to progress even afterexposure has ceased, which makes prevention even more vital. In addition to the threat posed to the general occupational populationby respiratory toxins, certain subpopulations, such as persons with impairedlung function caused by asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and pulmonary fibrosis,are at special risk from the adverse effects of respiratory toxins. Tobaccosmoking can cause or aggravate all of the respiratory conditions discussedabove and can interact additively or synergistically with respiratory toxinsto increase their adverse effects on the pulmonary system. For example,tobacco smoking acts additively with coal dust to diminish pulmonary function.Because tobacco smoke contains nitrogen oxides, cadmium, and ammonia, occupationallyexposed workers who smoke have an additional source of exposure to theserespiratory toxins (U.S. HEW 1979). Two general categories of lung injuries are relevant to the group of substancesunder consideration: andbullet; Damage to cells lining the airways, which results in necrosis(localized areas of dead cells), increased permeability, and edema. andbullet; Production of fibrosis, which may become massive and greatly reducelung capacity. <T3>Cellular damage resulting in edema and emphysema. </T3>A number ofsubstances cause damage to cells lining the airways. This can result inincreased permeability of cell membranes and subsequent edema, hemorrhage,and localized necrosis (areas of dead cells). Chronic inhalation of certainchemicals causes destruction of the alveolar septa and results in emphysema.Cellular damage may be either localized or diffuse, depending on the distributionof the toxicant in the lung. Edema is the release of fluid into the lumen (open spaces of the airways)or alveoli. Serious edema can take several hours to develop so that, insome cases, life-threatening or even fatal exposures can take place withoutthe individual's being aware at the time of exposure of the extent of thedamage. Ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and paraquat all cause localized cellulardamage leading to edema (Klaassen et al. 1986). Fatalities from pulmonaryedema have resulted from exposures to concentrations of nitrogen dioxideof about 200 ppm (Sax 1984). Paraquat is unusual in that it can cause delayedpulmonary damage following exposure, even when exposure occurs via routesother than inhalation (Klaassen et al. 1986). Necrotic changes can reduce the functional surface area of the lung. Onetype of lesion often noted in persons exposed to respiratory toxins isbenign granulomas, which are localized masses formed when the immune systemattempts to sequester a foreign object. Depending on the extent of thedamage, these masses may reduce the functional capacity of the lung. Exposureto selenium-doped bismuth telluride has been associated with the productionof benign granulomas without fibrosis (Wagner et al. 1974). Emphysema is caused by a gradual destruction of the cells of the alveolarsepta, which causes a loss of elasticity in the lung. A slight degree ofemphysema is present in much of the adult population and does not causeany functional impairment. As the disease progresses, however, seriousand life-threatening reductions in functional capacity can occur. Oncethe disease has advanced to the point of serious functional impairment,it is, for the most part, irreversible (Petersdorf et al. 1983). Thereis evidence that a number of the substances in this group cause emphysema,including sulfur tetrafluoride (ACGIH 1986), ozone, and nitrogen dioxide(Klaassen et al. 1986). <T3>Fibrotic changes. </T3>Pulmonary fibrosis was one of the earliest recognizedforms of occupational disease. Fibrosis should be distinguished from pneumoconiosis,although these terms are often used interchangeably. Pneumoconiosis isa more general term indicating the presence of a foreign substance in thelung, as determined by radiographic (X-ray) analysis. This definition encompassesa variety of conditions and does not by itself necessarily indicate functionaldamage (Petersdorf et al. 1983). In contrast, fibrosis is a seriously debilitatingdisease. One type of fibrosis is interstitial fibrosis, which is a kindof pneumoconiosis characterized by deposition of fibrous tissue in theinterstitial spaces between the alveolar membrane and the pulmonary capillarymembrane. Interstitial fibrosis greatly reduces the diffusing capacityof the lung and thus causes oxygen deprivation in the body (Guyton 1981).Like emphysema, fibrosis is largely irreversible; it sometimes progresseseven in the absence of further exposure (Petersdorf et al. 1983). Silicosis is a form of interstitial fibrosis that is caused by exposureto respirable silica particles (Klaassen et al. 1986). Exposure to coaldust causes a pneumoconiosis with fibrosis that can be severely debilitating(Petersdorf et al. 1983). In addition, exposure to graphite, mica, andgrain dust have all been associated with fibrosis in workers (ACGIH 1986).Dose-Response Relationships and Respiratory Effects For most of the substances in this group, permissible exposure limits havebeen based on health surveys and case reports of occupationally exposedpopulations. In some cases, animal studies provide the evidence of a substance'stoxicity. As is the case for most of the substances for which OSHA is proposingnew, reduced, or revised limits, the dose-response curve for respiratoryirritants tends to be S-shaped. Table C6-2 presents dose-response data on the adverse pulmonary effectsof representative chemicals in this group, the populations exposed, andthe endpoints observed. The following discussions of respiratory toxinspresent OSHA's preliminary findings for all the substances on Table C6-1and describe the nature of the risks faced by workers exposed to them.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 004 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 362-365 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">ALUMINUM (PYRO POWDERS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: Al </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1017</ITAG>OSHA currently has no permissible exposure limits for aluminum pyro powders.The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\. Aluminum pyro powders have a higher reported toxicity than aluminum metaldusts (Stokinger 1981). Several British studies have examined the effectsof this finely flaked aluminum on workers in paints and pyrotechnics plants.Their findings revealed that pulmonary fibrosis may result from exposureto pyro powders, although epidemiologic evidence indicated that additivesused to prevent oxidation and agglomeration may have contributed to theincidence and nature of the disease (Edling 1961; Jordan 1961; Mitchell1961). The ACGIH observes that exposures that have previously caused lungchanges in workers are presumed to have been extremely high (ACGIH 1986,p. 22). OSHA preliminarily concludes that the proposed permissible exposure limitof 5 mg/m\3\ TWA for aluminum pyro powders will prevent the occurrenceof lung changes in exposed workers. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for aluminum pyro powders. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">BISMUTH TELLURIDE (DOPED) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1304-82-1; Chemical Formula: Bi<T2>2</T2>Te<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1034</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for doped bismuth telluride. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ for Bi<T2>2</T2>Te<T2>3 </T2>that has been doped with selenium sulfide. Bismuth tellurideappears as gray, hexagonal platelets; it is also available as ingots orsingle crystals. Wagner and co-workers conducted a 1-year study in which rabbits, dogs,and rats were exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week to doped bismuth telluridedust (containing 80.04 mol % Bi<T2>2</T2>Te<T2>3 </T2>and 0.20 mol % SnTe, plus a small stoichiometric excess of Te)of 1.04 um particle diameter at a mean concentration of 15 mg/m\3\. Small,granulomatous lesions without fibrosis appeared in the lungs of dogs at6 months. In dogs that were sacrificed 4 months after an 8-month exposure,the lesions had regressed, and the affected lymph nodes were without cellularreaction. Rabbits exhibited similar histologic effects, but with decreasednumbers of pulmonary macrophages, no fibrous tissue proliferation, andno cellular or fibrous tissues reaction around the dust deposits in thelymph nodes. The rats showed fewer granulomas but some areas of epithelializationof the alveolar walls. As was true for the other species, the rats showedneither fibrosis nor cellular reaction in the lymph nodes, despite accumulationof the intermetallic dust (Wagner, Madden, Zimber et al. 1974). A PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA is proposed for Se-doped bismuth telluride to preventthe occurrence of pulmonary lesions seen in experimental animals. OSHAbelieves this limit will reduce the risk of these pulmonary effects. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit fordoped bismuth telluride. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLORINE DIOXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10049-04-4; Chemical Formula: ClO<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1080</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 ppm for chlorine dioxide.The ACGIH recommends the same time-weighted average and a 15-minute STELof 0.3 ppm. Chlorine dioxide is a red-yellow gas at ordinary temperatures.Rats exposed to 0.1-ppm concentrations of chlorine dioxide for 10 weeksat 5 hours daily showed no adverse effects from exposures. Other data inanimals are not available (Dalhamn 1957). Data on human exposures indicate that marked irritation occurs on inhalationof 5 ppm (no time specified) and that one death occurred at 19 ppm (Elkins1959). Repeated exposures in an exposed individual have been linked tobronchitis and pronounced emphysema (Petry 1954). Clinical studies conductedby Gloemme and Lundgren (1957) revealed that the majority of workers whohad been exposed for 5 years to average concentrations of chlorine dioxidebelow 0.1 ppm, in combination with about 1.0 ppm chlorine, experiencedeye and respiratory irritation and slight bronchitis. Some gastrointestinalirritation was also observed in these workers. Gloemme and Lundgren (1957)attributed all of these effects to elevated short-term exposures involvingexcursions above the 0.1 ppm level. Ferris et al. (1964) have shown thatconcentrations occasionally ranging as high as 0.25 ppm were associatedwith respiratory effects in workers concomitantly exposed to chlorine.OSHA proposes a 0.1-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 0.3 ppm forchlorine dioxide. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of theselimits are necessary to protect exposed workers against the risk of respiratory,skin, and eye irritation known to occur as a result of short-term exposuresabove the TWA of 0.1 ppm. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for chlorine dioxide if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHROMIUM, METAL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-47-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1093</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/m3 for chromium metal. The ACGIHhas established an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m3 for this element. NIOSH hasno REL for the elemental form of chromium. Chromium is a steel-grey metal.The ACGIH (1986, p. 139) reports that exposure to chromium metal does notcause pulmonary fibrosis or pneumoconiosis. The ACGIH has established the0.5-mg/m3 TLV-TWA for this metal on the basis of its low order of toxicity(ACGIH 1986, p. 139), and states that this limit ``should be adequate toprevent pulmonary disease or other toxic effects.'' OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.5 mg/m3 for chromium metal.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect againstthe risk of pulmonary or other toxic effects potentially associated withexposure to chromium. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis forproposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill establish a new limit for chromium metal if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">COAL DUST, andless;5% QUARTZ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">COAL DUST, andgreater;5% QUARTZ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. Nos. 1096 and 1097</ITAG>OSHA has a current formula limit of 10 mg/m3/% SiO<T2>2</T2>+2 for coal dust containing a respirable quartz fraction greaterthan 5 percent, and a 2.4-mg/m3 limit for coal dust containing a respirablequartz fraction of less than 5 percent. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 0.1 mg/m3 for the respirable quartz fraction of coal dust containingmore than 5 percent quartz, and 2 mg/m3 for the respirable dust fractionof coal dust containing less than 5 percent quartz. Coal is a natural darkbrown to black-colored solid formed from fossilized plants. The National Coal Board of the United Kingdom has calculated the probabilitiesof developing pneumoconiosis from various concentrations of coal dust,based on statistical data from the first 10 years of an epidemiologic study(1969). The study involved 4,122 men from 20 coal pits, for whom radiologistscompared pairs of chest X-rays taken at 10-year intervals. The radiologistsclassified the degree of pneumoconiosis observed in the X-rays in accordancewith the International Labour Office's (ILO) pneumoconiosis classificationscheme. For each of the 20 collieries, data concerning mean respirabledust concentrations at the coal face were analyzed. Mean coal, carbon,and quartz content of the dust from each of the collieries were also analyzed.Results indicated that the progression of pneumoconiosis correlates significantlywith mean respirable dust concentrations and with the respirable quartzfraction of that dust. The carbon content of the dust did not correlatewith the development of pneumoconiosis. Estimates of the risk of developingILO category 2 or greater pneumoconiosis after a 35-year exposure to coaldust containing a respirable quartz fraction of greater than 5 percentquartz were projected to be a 10-percent probability of disease at a concentrationof 6.5 mg/m3, and a zero probability at a concentration of 2.2 mg/m3. Forexposures to coal dust containing a respirable quartz fraction of lessthan 5 percent quartz, a 10-percent probability of developing ILO category1 or greater disease was projected at a concentration of 4 mg/m3, and azero probability of disease was projected at 1.6 mg/m3. In 1979, Gormleyconfirmed these calculations, but reduced the concentration of dust containingmore than 5 percent respirable quartz associated with a zero probabilityof developing pneumoconiosis to 1 mg/m3 (ACGIH 1986, p. 142). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m3, measured as respirable silica,for coal dust with a respirable quartz fraction containing more than 5percent quartz, and an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 mg/m3 TWA for coal dust witha respirable quartz fraction containing less than 5 percent quartz. TheAgency's current formula limit is similar to the 0.1 mg/m3 limit and, thus,does not represent a change in the limit (see discussion for crystallinesilica-quartz below). OSHA is proposing to revise its formula limit forcoal dust containing more than 5 percent quartz to 0.1 mg/m3 to simplifyemployee exposure monitoring. OSHA also concludes that the reduction inthe 8-hour TWA PEL for coal dust containing less than 5 percent quartzwill protect exposed workers from the risk of pneumoconiosis at the existinglimit for coal dust with this quartz content. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for coal dust if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYL ACRYLATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 140-88-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCOOC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1161</ITAG>OSHA has a current 8-hour TWA of 25 ppm for ethyl acrylate, with a skinnotation. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 15ppm for ethyl acrylate, which is a colorless liquid. The ACGIH also recommendsa skin notation for this substance. Ethyl acrylate produces irritation of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes,gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system (Dreisbach 1974). The oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats fed this substance is 1020 mg/kg and the 4-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> for these animals ranges between 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm. Inrabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 1790 mg/kg (Pozzani et al. 1949), and the minimum oral LD<T2>50</T2> is 280 to 420 mg/kg (Treon et al. 1949). Animal studies alsoindicate that severe chronic effects may result from exposure to this substance.Rats exposed to levels of 70, 300, or 540 ppm of ethyl acrylate for upto 30 days showed accelerated mortality and pathologic changes in the lungs,liver, and kidneys. In those animals that developed pneumonia, renal andhepatic lesions were also seen. In a parallel study, rats, rabbits andguinea pigs who were subjected to ethyl acrylate concentrations in excessof 75 ppm for fifty, 7-hour inhalation periods exhibited pulmonary edema,degenerative changes in the heart, liver, and kidneys, and death (Treonet al. 1949). Miller et al. (1980) reported that rats and mice exposedto 75 or 225 ppm, 6 hours per day for 30 days, developed nasal lesionsand other degenerative inflammatory changes in the nasal structure. Inother studies, rats and mice administered 100 or 200 mg/kg ethyl acrylateby gavage 5 times per week for 103 weeks developed inflammation and hyperplasiaof the forestomach, in addition to squamous cell carcinomas and papillomasin the same area (NTP 1983, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 240). Based on astudy by Miller et al. (1985) in which rats and mice exposed to 25 or 75ppm ethyl acrylate for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 27 months developedlesions in the nasal cavity even at the lowest dose, the ACGIH (1986, p.240) concurs with the American Industrial Hygiene Association (1966) thata 25-ppm limit for ethyl acrylate is too high to prevent irritating effectsin exposed humans. In a study by Nemec and Bauer (1978), human volunteers experienced drowsiness,headache, and nausea after prolonged inhalation exposures at 50 to 75 ppm.Opdyke (1975) reported that the application of a 4-percent concentrationof ethyl acrylate produced skin sensitization reactions in 10 out of 24volunteers. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 5 ppm, a 15-minute STEL, and a skinnotation, for ethyl acrylate. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits will protect workers from the risk of severe nasal irritation andeye and skin irritation associated with exposure to this substance at thelevel permitted by OSHA's current limit. The skin notation is necessaryto protect against skin sensitization and skin absorption. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethyl acrylateif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">FERROVANADIUM DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 12604-58-9; Chemical Formula: FeV </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1177</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 1 mg/m\3\ for ferrovanadium dust. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA limit of 1 mg/m\3\ with a TLV-STEL of 3 mg/m\3\. TheNIOSH-recommended exposure limit for metallic vanadium is 1 mg/m\3\ asa 10-hour TWA. Ferrovanadium dust exists as dark, odorless, solid particles.Soviet studies in animals showed ferrovanadium dust to be less toxic thanvanadium pentoxide. Roshchin (1952) reported that no acute intoxicationoccurred in animals exposed to ferrovanadium dust at concentrations ashigh as 10,000 mg/m\3\, serious chronic pulmonary changes were observedafter short-term exposures (one hour) on alternate days for two monthsto concentrations in the 1000- to 2000-mg/m\3\ range. These pulmonary changesconsisted of chronic bronchitis and chronic lung inflammation. OSHA proposes a PEL of 1 mg/m\3\ TWA and a STEL of 3 mg/m\3\ for ferrovanadiumdust, in order to reduce the risk of chronic pulmonary damage potentiallyassociated with exposures to this substance at the elevated short-termlevels permitted by the TWA limit alone. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat the proposed TWA and STEL will substantially reduce this risk. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forferrovanadium dust if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">GRAIN DUST (OAT, WHEAT, AND BARLEY) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1190</ITAG>A judicial decision has held that there is no OSHA exposure limit for graindust, and NIOSH also has no REL for this substance. The ACGIH has recommendedthat worker exposure to grain dust (oat, wheat. and barley) not exceed4 mg/m\3\ as total dust. Exposure to grain dust was reported to result in radiographic changes consistentwith pneumoconiosis and fibrosis in 11 of 57 workers handling grain. Noexposure information was available (Dunner et al. 1946). Chronic bronchitiswas reported in an epidemiologic investigation of workers exposed to concentrationsof oat dust ranging from 214 mg/m\3\ to 308 mg/m\3\ and of wheat dust rangingfrom 20.2 to 4:06 mg/m\3\ (Williams et al. 1964). In a third study by Rankinand do Pico (1980), respirable grain dust concentrations of 20 mg/m\3\caused pre- to post-workshift changes of more than 20 percent in the forcedexpiratory volumes of exposed individuals, indicating reduced lung function.In contrast, lung function changes were infrequent among workers exposedto total grain dust concentrations below 15 mg/m\3\ (Rankin and do Pico1980). These same authors reported that grain fever occurred among volunteersexposed to 15 mg/m\3\ of grain dust for 1 to 3 hours. They also reporteda higher incidence of respiratory symptoms among workers exposed to 13.9mg/m\3\ TWA. However, acute bronchial symptoms did not appear among workersexposed at or below 4 mg/m\3\. Although dose response data for grain dustsother than wheat are not available' two recent studies (Darke et al. 1976;Cockcroft et al. 1983) have demonstrated the appropriateness of applyingthe same PEL to all three of these grain dusts. The work of these authorsshowed that exposure to any of these dusts produced the same type and degreeof respiratory distress. Based on the observed no-effect level reported by Rankin and do Pico (1986),OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 4 mg/m\3\ for grain dust. OSHA preliminarilyfinds that this PEL for grain dust will greatly reduce the risk of chronicbronchitis, reduced pulmonary function, grain fever, and respiratory symptomscurrently faced by workers exposed at uncontrolled levels. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for grain dust. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">GRAPHITE, NATURAL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-42-5; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1191</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for natural graphite (total dust) is 15 millionparticles per cubic foot (mppcf), which is equivalent to 2.5 mg/m\3\ asrespirable dust (assuming that respirable mass is one-half total particlemass). The ACGIH has recommended a graphite TLV of 2.5 mg/m\3\ for respirabledust containing less than 1 percent quartz. Graphite is a mineral substancethat is best known for its use as the ``lead'' in pencils. Early reports established that graphite deposited in the lungs of occupationallyexposed workers caused pneumoconiosis (Koopman 1924). Subsequent researchdescribed the condition produced by exposure to graphite as anthracosilicosis,a pulmonary condition similar to that seen in coal miners, based on radiographicand histologic examinations in exposed individuals (Harding and Oliver1949). The fibrotic changes seen in graphite workers appear to be relatedto the silica content of the graphite; experimental animals that were administeredgraphite that did not contain silica did not develop fibrotic changes (Rayet al. 1951), while another study found that graphite containing only asmall amount of silica produced fibrotic changes in exposed animals (Ottowiczand Paradowski 1961). Radiologic changes were also observed among graphitemine and production workers exposed to graphite containing from 3.6 to10 percent silica (Pendergass et al. 1967). Although the role of silica in the development of pneumoconiosis amonggraphite workers remains unclear, OSHA preliminarily concludes that thecurrent limit of 15 mppcf (2.5 mg/m\3\ for the respirable fraction of graphitecontaining less than 1 percent quartz) will protect employees from pneumoconiosisthat may develop from exposure to graphite, whether silica-containing ornot. However, OSHA is proposing to revise its limit to 2.5 mg/m\3\ as respirabledust to simplify the monitoring of employee exposures, because the useof impingers and microscopic analyses are not required to measure exposuresthat are expressed in mg/m\3\ rather than mppcf.<ITAG tagnum="26">INDIUM AND COMPOUNDS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-74-6; Chemical Formula: In </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1213</ITAG>There is no current OSHA limit for indium and compounds, and NIOSH doesnot have a REL for these substances. The ACGIH has recommended that exposuresto indium not exceed 0.1 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA.Although there is no direct human evidence of the effects of indium compounds,severe effects have been produced by indium exposures in experimental animals.Rats that inhaled the sesquioxide form of indium at airborne concentrationsranging from 24 to 97 mg/m\3\ daily for a total of 224 hours developedwidespread alveolar edema; these histologic lesions did not change aftera 12-week post-exposure period. Exposure of animals to indium reduces alveolarclearance and may be associated with chronic respiratory insufficiency,recurrent acute pneumonitis, and death. Because of the severity of indium-induced injury and the persistence ofsuch injuries, OSHA preliminarily concludes that, in the absence of anexposure limit, exposed employees are placed at risk of developing chroniclung function impairment. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for indium and compounds. At the time of thefinal rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines thatthis limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">IRON OXIDE (DUST AND FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1309-37-1; CHEMICAL FORMULA: Fe<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Animals exposed to iron oxide or to iron oxide mixed with less than 5 percentsilica by inhalation or by intratracheal injection did not develop pulmonaryfibrosis (Naeslund 1940; Harding, Grout, Durkan et al. 1950). Inhalationof iron oxide dust did not produce lung cancer in mice (Muller and Erhardt1956). The evidence in humans is conflicting. Drinker, Warren, and Page (1935)concluded that exposures to iron oxide fume should be maintained below10 mg/m\3\, and a U.S. Department of Labor study (1941) found that exposuresbelow 30 mg/m\3\ were without adverse effect. There are several studies,on the other hand, that report chest X-ray abnormalities in miners, welders,silver polishers, electrolytic iron oxide workers, foundry workers, andboiler scalers (Doig and McLaughlin 1936; Stewart and Faulds 1934; Doigand McLaughlin 1948; McLaughlin, Grout, Barries, and Harding 1945; Davidson,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 325; Prendergass and Leopold 1945; Dunner andHerman 1944) exposed to iron oxide dust or fume. However, the exposuresof many of these workers were mixed and included exposure to varying amountsof silica; some of these workers developed disabling penumoconiosis. McLaughlin (1951), whose opinion on the subject is widely accepted, foundthat the presence of iron oxide dust or fume in the lung caused a pigmentation(termed siderosis) that was responsible for the changes seen in exposedindividuals' chest X-rays. Siderosis is believed not to progress to fibrosis(Fawcitt 1943; Fleischer, Nelson, and Drinker 1945; Hamlin and Weber 1950).It is believed that 6 to 10 years of exposure to about 15 mg/m\3\ of ironoxide is needed before siderosis develops (Fawcitt 1943; Fleischer, Nelson,and Drinker 1945; Hamlin and Weber 1950), although no studies are availableto correlate exposure levels with X-ray changes. Some studies have shown that workers with exposures to iron oxide and suchother substances as silica, radon gas, diesel exhaust, core oils, and thethermal decomposition products of synthetic resins (Faulds 1957; Dreyfus1936; Bidstrup 1959; Boyd, Doll, Faulds, and Leiper 1970; Braun, Guillorm,Pierson, and Sadoul 1960; Monlibert and Roubille 1960; Jorgensen 1973;Muller and Erhardt 1956; Kosela, Hernberg, Karava et al. 1976; Gibson,Martin, and Lockington 1978) have a greater risk of developing lung cancer.The ACGIH states that, ``at this time, it is not generally accepted thatexposure to iron oxide dust or fume causes cancer in man'' (1986, p. 325).A review of the world literature by Stokinger (1984) concluded that exposureto iron oxide <T3>per se </T3>was not carcinogenic. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ for iron oxide dust and fume,measured as total particulate (Fe). The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this limit will protect workers from the risk of siderosis and itsaccompanying generalized pulmonary densities associated with exposure atthe existing PEL. The Agency believes that this limit will substantiallyreduce this risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for iron oxide if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">METHYLENE BIS-(4-CYCLOHEXYLISOCYANATE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 5124-30-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>15</T2>H<T2>22</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate) is a pulmonary, skin, and eye irritant.The oral LD<T2>50 </T2>in rats is 9.9 g/kg. A 5-percent solution applied to the skinof guinea pigs produced strong erythema and edema, and rabbits treatedwith 0.1 mg showed severe skin reactions (Younger Laboratories 1965, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 392). Rats inhaling a lethal concentration of 20 ppm for 5 hours exhibited markedrespiratory irritation, tremors, and convulsions during exposure, and theirlungs revealed severe congestion and edema after death (E.I. du Pont deNemours and Company 1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 392). Repeated inhalationexposure at 0.4 ppm produced initial weight loss in rats; exposure at 1.2ppm caused respiratory irritation and decreased growth (E.I. du Pont deNemours and Company 1978). Guinea pigs exposed to 0.12 ppm and mice exposedto 0.65 ppm did not exhibit dermal sensitivity (Stadler and Karol 1984).Unlike toluene diisocyanate, which is a sensory irritant, methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate)depresses respiration by producing pulmonary irritation, e.g.. an exposedmouse showed a 50-percent decrease in respiration rate, along with lungirritation, when exposed to 3.7 ppm of this substance (weyel and Schaffer1985). Human exposures to this compound have resulted in skin sensitization butonly infrequently in pulmonary sensitization (Emmett 1976; Israeli et al.1981). OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 0.01 ppm for methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate).The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the risk of eye, skin, and pulmonary irritation potentially associatedwith occupational exposures to this substance at the levels permitted inthe absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate).

No. 1289</ITAG>Both the ACGIH and NIOSH have recommended occupational limits for nitrogendioxide. The current ACGIH recommendation is for a 3-ppm TWA and a 5-ppmSTEL. The NIOSH REL is 1 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. OSHA's currentPEL is 5 ppm as a ceiling value. The previous ACGIH TLV of 5 ppm as a ceiling concentration (the basis forthe current OSHA limit) was based primarily on the animal studies of Grayet al. (1952 1954) and Wagner et al. (1965). Gray et al. (1952 1954) demonstratedlung injury among rats exposed for 8 or more weeks to an 8 ppm concentrationof a mixture of NO<T2>2</T2> and nitric acid, but these authors did not see such lesionsin rats exposed for 6 months to 4 ppm concentrations of this mixture. Wagneret al. (1965) reported transient, mild acute effects and no adverse chroniceffects in rats exposed to 1 ppm, 5 ppm, or 25 ppm pure NO<T2>2</T2> for 18 months. The ACGIH's recommendation that the 5 ppm TLVbe defined as a ceiling rather than an 8-hour TWA was based on reportsthat NO<T2>2</T2> accelerated lung tumor development among lung-tumor susceptiblemice; in the late 1960s, the ACGIH believed that a TLV-ceiling value wouldminimize the risk of accelerating lung tumor development. The current ACGIH TLVs for NO<T2>2</T2> of a 3-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 5-ppm STEL are based on human studiesthat indicate that normal respiratory function may be compromised at exposuresbelow the current OSHA ceiling limit of 5 ppm NO<T2>2</T2>. In particular, Kosmider et al. (1972) reported a slight reductionin vital capacity and maximum respiratory volume in 70 men exposed to 0.4-to 2.7-ppm concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen 6 to 8 hours dailyfor 4 to 6 years. These authors also reported an unspecified number ofcases of chronic bronchitis among men in this group. Another study by Vigdortschiket al. (1937) reported possible cases of chronic bronchitis and emphysemaamong 127 workers generally exposed below 2.8 ppm NO<T2>2</T2>; these workers were also believed to be exposed to sulfuricacid mist at levels sufficient to cause dental erosion. The NIOSH REL for NO<T2>2</T2> of 1 ppm as a 15-minute STEL is based on the two human studiesdiscussed above, as well as some human studies involving short-term exposure.Abe (1967) found a 40-percent decrease in effective lung compliance amonghealthy adult males 30 minutes after a 10-minute exposure to 4- to 5-ppmNO<T2>2</T2>. Expiratory and inspiratory maximum viscous resistance alsoincreased after exposure. NIOSH (1976c) concluded that Abe's results ``documenta definite and undesirable effect'' at exposures approaching the currentOSHA limit. A significant decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacitywas observed by Von Nieding et al. (1973) in healthy adults exposed to5 ppm for 15 minutes. NIOSH also cites the work of Von Nieding et al. andKrekeler (1971), who reported significant increases in airway resistanceamong 88 chronic bronchitis patients after a 15-minute exposure to a concentrationof NO<T2>2</T2> as low as 1.5 ppm. NIOSH (1976c) concluded that the specificconcentration of NO<T2>2</T2> required to produce pulmonary changes in normal, healthy adultsis unknown, but is ``likely to be about the same or perhaps a slightlyhigher concentration than the one inducing pulmonary changes in humanswith existing chronic bronchitis'' (1.5 ppm). Therefore, NIOSH recommendeda 1-ppm 15-minute short-term limit for nitrogen dioxide. To provide additionalsupport for a short term rather than a TWA limit, NIOSH cites several animalstudies that indicate that the toxic effects associated with exposure toNO<T2>2</T2> are primarily determined by peak, and not average, concentrationsof exposure. After reviewing the evidence cited by ACGIH (1986) and NIOSH (1976c), OSHApreliminarily concludes that the current 5-ppm ceiling limit for nitrogendioxide is not sufficient to protect workers against impairment of pulmonaryfunction. The studies by Abe (1967) and by Von Nieding et al. (1973) clearlyshow that even brief exposures to levels at or just below the current OSHAlimit are associated with measurable declines in pulmonary function. Thework of Von Nieding et al. and Krekeler (1971) suggests that workers whoserespiratory systems are already compromised will be adversely affectedduring exposures even to lower concentrations of NO<T2>2</T2>. Therefore, OSHA believes it necessary to reduce the currentoccupational exposure limit of NO<T2>2</T2> to reduce this risk, and is proposing to change the limit fornitrogen dioxide to 1 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. Human healthstudies indicate respiratory effects at levels ranging from 0.4 to 2.8ppm. Health effects have also been observed following short-term exposuresranging from 1.5 to 5.0 ppm. OSHA therefore concludes that the 3-ppm TWA),5-ppm (STEL) TLV is not sufficiently protective and proposes that a 1-ppm(STEL) be adopted as the PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for nitrogen dioxide if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk. OSHA's preliminaryfeasibility analysis is based on limited data at this exposure level; additionalfeasibility information is requested from the public.<ITAG tagnum="26">OXYGEN DIFLOURIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-41-7; Chemical Formula: OF<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1300</ITAG>The current PEL for oxygen difluoride is 0.05 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. NIOSHhas no REL for this substance. The ACGIH has established a limit of 0.05ppm as a ceiling value. The revision of the TLV for oxygen difluoride froman 8-hour TWA to a ceiling value reflects the general position of the ACGIHthat ceiling TLVs are more appropriate for chemicals that cause acute butnot chronic health effects. Oxygen difluoride is a substance having extremely high acute toxicity;it is an acute irritant and causes fatal pulmonary edema and hemorrhagein animals exposed to 0.5 ppm for a few hours (ACGIH 1986). A single exposureto 0.1 ppm also had an effect on the lung as evidenced by development inanimals of a tolerance to the acute effects of this substance after anisolated exposure. Animals acutely exposed to oxygen difluoride have alsoexhibited gross changes in the kidney and internal genitalia (LaBelle etal. 1945; Lester and Adams 1965). Because of the extreme acute toxicity of this compound, OSHA believes thatthe current TWA-PEL of 0.05 ppm is not sufficiently protective of workers,in that this limit would permit brief periods of high exposure (i.e., at0.5 ppm or more) that have been associated with severe lung damage. Therefore,to reduce the risk of acute lung damage associated with brief excursionexposures to oxygen difluoride, OSHA proposes to revise its 0.05 TWA-PELto a ceiling value. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for oxygen difluoride if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">OZONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10028-15-6; Chemical Formula: O<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1301 </ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for ozone is 0.1 ppm TWA. In the interval since thislimit was adopted in 1971, the ACGIH has recommended that 15-minute short-termexposures to ozone not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH has no REL for ozone. Ozone is highly injurious and lethal in experimental animals at concentrationsas low as a few parts per million (Stokinger 1957). A study in which youngmice were exposed to 1 ppm ozone for 1 or 2 days reported damage to alveolartissue (Bils 1970). Human populations chronically exposed to lower concentrationsof ozone have been observed to have changes in lung function. In one study,human volunteers exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone for 3 hours a day, 6 days a week,for 12 weeks showed significant changes in lung function (Jaffe 1967).Other authors reported a 20 percent reduction in timed vital capacity inpersons exposed to average concentrations of ozone of 1.5 ppm (range notindicated) for 2 hours (Griswold et al. 1957). Welders exposed to maximalozone concentrations of 9 ppm were observed to have pulmonary congestion(Kleinfeld and Giel 1956). OSHA is proposing a STEL based on observations that significant declinesin pulmonary function can result from repeated intermittent exposures oreven from a single short term exposure (Bils 1970; Jaffe 1967; Griswoldet al. 1957). OSHA believes that, in the absence of a STEL, employees willcontinue to be at risk of the impairment in pulmonary functional capacityassociated with short-term exposures that could occur if exposures arecontrolled only by an 8-hour TWA. Thus the Agency preliminarily concludesthat it is necessary to supplement the existing PEL with the proposed STELof 0.3 ppm. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for ozone if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PARAQUAT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 4685-14-7; Chemical Formula: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1303</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for paraquat is 0.5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, witha skin notation. The ACGIH has established a limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ as an8-hour TWA. Paraquat refers to a group of compounds that are odorless,yellow solids. The principal compounds are: 1,1andmin16;-dimethyl-4,4andmin16;-bipyridinium;1,1andmin16;-dimethyl-4,4andmin16;-bipyridinium bis (methyl sulfate); and 1,1andmin16;-dimethyl4,4andmin16;-bipyridinium dichloride. The toxicity of these compounds depends on the compound's cationic moiety.Acute oral toxicity is reported as 30 mg/kg ion as cation for guinea pigsand 127 mg/kg ion for female rats, while the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 240 mg/kg ion (Clark 1964; Clark, McElligott,and Hurst 1966; Elligott 1965). Paraquat can penetrate broken skin afterit has broken down the skin's usual barriers (Swan 1969; Clark 1966). Byinhalation or intratracheal injection, paraquat is very toxic because ofits irritant properties (Gage 1968). Rats exposed once for 6 hours to aconcentration of 1 mg/m3 died if the aerosol contained particles with diametersof 3 to 5 microns (Gage 1968). Rats exposed 6 hours/day for 3 weeks tothe same aerosol at 0.4 mg/m3 exhibited signs of pulmonary irritation;no effects were observed for the same exposure regimen at 0.1 mg/m3 (Gage1968). When the diameter of the particles in the aerosol are not of respirablesize, toxicity is greatly reduced. The 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 6400 mg/kg, and dogs, rats, and guinea pigs tolerated3 weeks of daily exposures to 100 mg/m3 without apparent pulmonary effect(although nosebleeds were observed) (Palazzolo 1965, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 456). Dietary administration, for 90 days, of doses ranging from 300 to 700 ppmshowed dose-related effects ranging from pulmonary edema to intraalveolarhemorrhage and death (Kimbrough and Gaines 1970). Paraquat's teratogenic potency in mice is low (Bus et al. 1975), although100 ppm administered in the drinking water of pregnant rats increased postnatalmortality significantly (Bus and Gibson 1975). In humans, 69 accidental deaths and 81 suicides were attributed to theeffects of paraquat exposure up to 1972 (Chipman Chemicals 1972, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 456). Bouletreau, Ducluzeau, Bui-Xuan et al. (1977) reported31 cases of renal insufficiency, and a spray applicator was killed whenhe absorbed a lethal dose of inadequately diluted paraquat through theskin (Jeros 1978). Workers using a 0.05- to 1-percent solution of paraquatdeveloped skin and mucous membrane irritation but experienced no symptomsof systemic poisoning (Howard 1978). Fugita, Suzuki, and Ochiai (1976)reported 5 cases of reversible kerato-conjunctivitis, with corneal injury,after a month of exposure to paraquat. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for paraquat, with askin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willprotect workers from the risk of skin, eye, and pulmonary irritation observedin animals exposed to aerosols of respirable size at levels below OSHA'sexisting PEL for paraquat. The Agency believes that this reduction in permissibleexposure level will substantially reduce this risk. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for paraquat ifthe Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. OSHA is retaining the skin notation for this substance because ofits capacity to penetrate the skin.<ITAG tagnum="26">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE-CRISTOBALITE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14464-46-1; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This formula corresponds to a rangeof 0.04 to 0.05 mg/m3, measured as silica, for dusts containing 10 to 100percent tridymite. The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 mg/m3,measured as silica dust. The ACGIH limit is based on a study by Gardner(1938) that was confirmed by King, Mahanty, Harrison, and Nagelschmidt(1953). Experimental animals injected with cristobalite showed a more severeresponse than that produced by quartz, and the fibrosis that followed wasdiffuse rather than nodular. Although expressed in different units, the current ACGIH and OSHA limitsfor cristobalite are comparable. The ACGIH's mg/m3 limit, adopted in 1985,does not reflect a re-evaluation of cristobalite's toxicity but was adoptedmerely to simplify the monitoring of cristobalite dust concentrations.OSHA is proposing to replace its limit for cristobalite, which is expressedas the formula presented above, with a numerically equivalent limit of0.05 mg/m3; the Agency is making this change to simplify employee exposuremonitoring.<ITAG tagnum="26">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE_QUARTZ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14808-60-7; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH does not see this change in the value of its limit foroccupational exposure to silica as significant; instead, the ACGIH madethis change to conform its limit for this dust to its TLVs for other dusts.If the OSHA formula is used to calculate a limit for a dust containing100 percent quartz, the limit would be 0.098 mg/m\3\, not appreciably differentfrom the ACGIH's revised limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for respirable quartz dust.For quartz dusts containing less than 100 percent free silica, the currentOSHA formula would yield a limit of, for example, 0.83 mg/m\3\ for respirabledust containing 10 percent quartz. This result is only slightly more stringentthan the ACGIH's TLV of 0.1 mg/m\3\. For cristobalite and tridymite, theOSHA formula and the ACGIH limits yield approximately the same results:both are approximately one-half the limit established by these two entitiesfor quartz dust (see discussions below). Occupational exposure to free silica has been known for many years to producesilicosis, a chronic, disabling lung disease characterized by the formationof silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs. Simple silicosis,in which the nodules are less than 1 cm in diameter (as measured on chestx-ray films) is generally asymptomatic but can be slowly progressive, evenin the absence of continued exposure. Complicated silicosis (i.e., nodulesgreater than 1 cm in diameter) is more often associated with disabilityand can also progress in the absence of continuing exposure. The health basis underlying the ACGIH's limit for crystalline silica isthe work of Russell (1929), which suggested that a limit of 10 mppcf wouldprotect workers from the effects of exposure to granite dust; a study byAyer (1969) demonstrated that 10 mppcf of granite dust is approximatelyequal to 0.1 mg/m\3\ of respirable quartz dust (ACGIH 1986). NIOSH has recommended an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ as respirable freesilica for all crystalline forms of silica. As applied to cristobaliteand tridymite, the NIOSH REL is 0.05 mg/m\3\, the same as the ACGIH TLV,but NIOSH's 0.05 mg/m\3\ REL for quartz dust is one-half the value of theACGIH TLV for quartz dust. To support its more stringent REL for quartzdust, NIOSH cites the work of Hosey et al. (1957), which reported thatno new cases of silicosis occurred in workers in Vermont granite shedswho were generally exposed to 0.05 mg/m\3\ or less of granite dust. Therecommendation was also partly based on studies by Theriault, Burgess etal. (1974); Theriault, Peters and Fine (1974); and Theriault, Peters andJohnson (1974) that found that annual declines in pulmonary function andabnormal chest x-rays occurred among 192 granite shed workers exposed toan average quartz concentration of 0.05 mg/m\3\. NIOSH noted that the exposureestimates reported in the Theriault studies probably failed to accountfor the higher exposures that probably occurred in the years before exposuresampling was initiated and thus that Theriault's exposure data may haveunderstated average exposures to quartz. Thus, NIOSH believes that theexposures responsible for the declines in pulmonary function were actuallyabove 0.05 mg/m\3\. The ACGIH (1986) found NIOSH's reasoning unpersuasive,citing a report by Graham et al. (1981), who measured the pulmonary functionof the same group of workers studied by Theriault et al., and found, incontrast to Theriault, that these workers experienced ``an overall increasein FVC and FEV'' (ACGIH 1986). The 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV represents no real change from the existing PEL. However,the use of an mg/m\3\ unit will simplify sampling procedures by using recentlydeveloped technologies which in turn will reduce the cost of air samplingto evaluate potential silica exposures. NIOSH admits to significant errorin the exposure estimates used to establish its 0.05-mg/m\3\ REL, and OSHAbelieves that use of this limit will introduce feasibility problems. Beforethis REL can be considered, for adoption as an OSHA limit, a more detailedanalysis would be required. OSHA therefore proposes that 0.1 mg/m\3\ beadopted as the PEL.<ITAG tagnum="26">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE-TRIDYMITE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 15468-32-3; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This limit correspondsto a respirable quartz concentration ranging from 0.08 to 0.1 mg/m\3\,measured as free silica. The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1mg/m\3\, measured as free silica; the ACGIH adopted this limit in 1985to simplify the monitoring of quartz dust concentrations. Thus, this revisiondoes not represent a re-evaluation of the toxicity data for fused silica.OSHA is proposing to replace its limit for fused silica, which is expressedas the formula presented above, with a numerically equivalent limit of0.1 mg/m\3\ as total respirable dust; the Agency is making this changeto simplify employee exposure monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="26">SOAPSTONE, TOTAL DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SOAPSTONE, RESPIRABLE DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: 3 Mg-4 SiO<T2>2</T2>-H<T2>2</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1363 (total dust) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1363A (respirable dust)</ITAG>OSHA's current exposure limit for soapstone total dust is 20 mppcf (6 mg/m\3\),and the Agency has no separate limit for the respirable fraction. The ACGIHhas established two TLV-TWAs for these two forms of soapstone: 6 mg/m\3\for total dust, and 3 mg/m\3\ for the respirable fraction, both measuredas total dust or respirable dust containing less than 1 percent quartz.Because the ratio of total dust mass to the mass of the respirable fractionis 2:1 (ACGIH 1984, p. 480), the 6-mg/m\3\ total dust limit automaticallyimplies a 3-mg/m\3\ limit for the respirable fraction. A study by Dreessen and DallaValle (1935) of mill workers exposed to soapstoneshowed lung changes in these workers, but it is believed that the dustsinvolved in these exposures were actually steatite talc, which had a tremolitecontent of 10 percent. Experiments by Miller and Sayers (1941) showed nomeasurable toxic effects in guinea pigs injected intraperitoneally withvarious samples of soapstone. OSHA is proposing to express the limit for soapstone total dust in mg/m\3\,rather than mppcf, to simplify employee sampling and analysis. The totaldust limit of 6 mg/m\3\ is equivalent to the previous limit of 20 mppcf,and the new limit of 3 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust is actually implicitin the total dust limit.<ITAG tagnum="26">SULFUR DIOXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7446-09-5; Chemical Formula: SO<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1375</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for sulfur dioxide is 5-ppm TWA. ACGIH has recommendeda 2-ppm TLV-TWA and a 5-ppm STEL. In its written testimony at OSHA's 1977hearing on sulfur dioxide, NIOSH recommended a 10-hour TWA of 0.5 ppm (NIOSH1977). ACGIH cites one epidemiologic study (Scalpe 1964) showing an increasedincidence of respiratory symptoms among pulpmill workers exposed to 10to 20 ppm sulfur dioxide. Another study by Ferris et al. (1967) found ahigh incidence (30 percent) of respiratory disease among pulpmill workersexposed to 2 to 13 ppm; however, this was not statistically different fromthe incidence of disease in a group of workers at a nearby papermill. Kehoeet al. (1932) also found an increased incidence of respiratory irritationamong refrigeration workers exposed to 20 to 30 ppm. Weir et al. (1972)exposed 12 healthy subjects to sulfur dioxide continuously for 120 hours.No subjective complaints or decline in respiratory function was found insubjects exposed to 0.3 or 1 ppm. Slight increases in airway resistanceresulted from exposure to 3 ppm. Based on these data, the ACGIH recommendeda TLV-TWA of 2 ppm and a STEL of 5 ppm. In recommending a 0.5-ppm TWA limit. NIOSH (1977j) cited four epidemiologicalstudies that became available after publication of their criteria document(NIOSH 1974b). Archer and Gillam (1977) found increases in the incidenceof respiratory disease and reductions in pulmonary function among workersexposed to 0.4 to 4 ppm (mean=2 ppm) for many years. Smith et al. (1977)reported pulmonary function decrements among workers exposed to between1 and 4 ppm sulfur dioxide; the decrements were statistically significantcompared to workers whose mean exposures were less than 1 ppm. A thirdstudy (Ministry of Health 1976) also reported increases in respiratorydisease incidence among smelter workers exposed to an average of 2.5 ppmfor 10 years or more. A fourth study reported finding no definite effectsamong 10,000 workers exposed to mean sulfur dioxide levels of 0.35 ppm.Based on these studies, NIOSH (1977j) revised its original recommendationfrom 2 ppm TWA to a 0.5-ppm TWA.The 2-ppm TLV-TWA is based on limited data showing no effects from exposuresat levels less than 1 ppm. The 0.5-ppm REL is based on additional informationindicating respiratory disease associated with exposures ranging from 0.4to 4 ppm, with no observed effects at 0.35 ppm. Although these findingssuggest that the ACGIH TLV may not be sufficiently protective, OSHA isconcerned that the NIOSH limit may present feasibility problems. The Agency'spreliminary feasibility analysis has considered only a PEL of 2 ppm. Atthis time, OSHA tentatively proposes that a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA, supplementedby a 5-ppm STEL, be adopted as the PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for sulfur dioxide if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.The Agency specifically solicits comments on feasibility and on any evidencerelated to adverse health effects at exposures at or below these levels.The proposed 2-ppm limit will be reconsidered in light of the feasibilityand health effects data obtained prior to the final rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="26">SULFUR TETRAFLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-60-0; Chemical Formula: SF<T2>4</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1378</ITAG>OSHA's current Z tables have no exposure limits for sulfur tetrafluoride.The ACGIH recommends 0.1 ppm as a ceiling limit. Sulfur tetrafluoride isa colorless, non-combustible gas. On contact with moisture, sulfur tetrafluoride produces sulfur dioxideand hydrogen fluoride (HF) (Lester 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 546),and it is the release of HF that is primarily responsible for sulfur tetrafluoride'stoxic effects (Zapp 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 546). A du Pont (1961)study of rats exposed for 4 hours to 4 ppm sulfur tetrafluoride over aperiod of 10 days reported that the animals demonstrated nasal discharge,difficulties in breathing, and weakness. Autopsies of these animals revealedevidence of emphysema, but those rats surviving exposure and given a 2-weekrest period after exposure showed no significant pathological changes.In the same study by du Pont, a 4-hour exposure to 20 ppm sulfur tetrafluorideproved lethal to one of two rats. In a study by Clayton (1962), irregularbreathing and signs of irritation were observed at exposures of 20 ppmand lower; animals receiving lethal amounts of sulfur tetrafluoride showedpulmonary edema on autopsy, and those with sub-lethal exposures demonstratedno pathologic changes 14 days later. OSHA is proposing a 0.1-ppm ceiling limit for this highly toxic gas. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that establishing this limit for this previouslyunregulated chemical will reduce the risk of chronic respiratory effectspotentially associated with exposure to the chemical at the levels permittedby the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for sulfur tetrafluoride. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">TALC (non-asbestiform) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14807-96-6: Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>Si 3/4Mg </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1381</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for non-asbestiform talc is 20 million particles percubic foot of air (mppcf) as an 8-hour TWA; this is roughly equivalentto 3 mg/m3. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 2 mg/m3 (15 mppcf) for talc,measured as respirable dust. Talc is a white to gray-white, fine powder.The health effects evidence for talc is complicated by the fact that talcscontain amphiboles and other minerals, in addition to platiform talc crystals;adverse health effects appear to be related to the non-platiform content(that is, to the fiber content) of the talc in question (ACGIH 1986, p.550). There are conflicting views over the extent to which the non-platiformconstituents are asbestos; however, no health effects information is availablethat is specifically related to non-asbestiform talc (ACGIH 1986, p. 550).Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the effects on workersof long-term exposures to talc. In 1942, Porro et al. (cited in Patty 1981)published a report in which 15 cases of talc pneumoconiosis, including5 postmortem examinations, showed that asbestotic bodies were almost alwayspresent in fibrotic areas of the lungs of those workers with talcosis.Siegal and his colleagues (1943, as cited in Patty 1981) noted that anadvanced fibrosis incidence rate of 14.5 percent existed among a groupof 221 talc miners and millers. These workers were primarily exposed tofibrous talc, which was held to be responsible for the pathology of theasbestos-like lung lesions. A study by McLaughlin et al. (1949, as citedin Patty 1981) revealed that talc-induced pneumoconiosis was caused bythe fibrous varieties of talc; in animal studies by Schepers and Durkin(1955, as cited in Patty 1981), the degree of fibrosis in the lung tissuewas found to be a function of the length of the talc fibers, rather thanof the composition of the talc itself. A paper by Kleinfeld et al. in 1963(as cited in Patty 1981) reported that postmortem examinations on 6 talcindustry workers showed that bodies found in the lung bronchioles or embeddedin fibrous tissue were indistinguishable from the asbestos bodies seenin cases of asbestosis.Kleinfeld et al. (1967) later conducted a cohort study of 220 workers employedin a mine that produced talc with a tremolite and anthophyllite content.Of the 91 deaths in this group, 10 resulted from respiratory cancer and28 were attributed to pneumoconiosis. The proportional mortality from respiratorycancer was four times the expected rate. In 1974, when Kleinfeld performeda follow-up study of this group, which at that time consisted of 260 workers(108 deaths), he found significant differences between expected and observedmortality in the period 1950 to 1954, but not during 1960 to 1969. Thisinvestigator attributed this finding to the reduction in talc dust counts(from averages of 25 to 73 mppcf in the years 1948 to 1965 to averagesof 9 to 43 mppcf in the period 1966 to 1969). This study also showed adecrease of greater than 50 percent in deaths due to pneumoconiosis inthe 1965-to-1969 time period. Studies by NIOSH (Dement and Zumwald 1978) of 398 white male workers employedbetween 1947 and 1959 in the talc industries found that 74 of these menhad died. Bronchogenic cancer was the cause of death in 9 men, whereasonly 3.3 deaths from this cause would have been expected. Non-malignantrespiratory disease (NMRD) exclusive of influenza, pneumonia, and tuberculosisaccounted for 3 deaths; 1.5 would have been expected. From these data,NIOSH concluded that a significant increase in mortality due to bronchogeniccancer and NMRD had occurred from occupational exposure to talc dust. NIOSH'sreport also included a morbidity study of 12 talc industry workers, currentlyemployed, in which chest X-rays, lung function tests, and questionnaireswere used. This study concluded that a higher prevalence of cough, phlegm,dyspnea, and irregular opacities in chest X-rays existed in these workersthan in potash miners; instances of pleural thickening and calcificationwere greater than in coal and potash miners; and the pulmonary functionof talc workers overall was reduced in comparison with that of coal andpotash miners employed for the same length of time. The reductions in pulmonaryfunction were dose- and duration-related. The ACGIH (1986, p. 552) concludes that serious health effects have beenassociated in the past (i.e., prior to 1945) with exposures to amphibole-containingtalc. However, the ACGIH believes that the introduction of mining improvementshas all but eliminated ``the excess of death rates from pneumoconiosisand lung cancer'' (ACGIH 1986, p. 552). Two recent studies of talc exposures (Rubino, Scansetti et al. 1976; Selevan,Dement et al. 1979) are available. The Rubino et al. study found that minersand millers exposed to an average of 849 to 8470 mppcf-years (miners) and76 to 651 mppcf-years (millers) showed no increase in the number of observed(compared to expected) deaths from causes other than silicosis. These authorsconcluded that the disease-causing factor in these workers was silica ratherthan talc (Rubino, Scansetti et al. 1976). Selevan and Dement's studies (1979) of 392 workers exposed to talc in fivemines found non-malignant respiratory deaths for millers to be almost eighttimes the expected rate, while miners experienced more than three timesthe expected mortality rate for these same diseases. The ACGIH (1986, p.552) concludes that the Selevan and Dement study is incomplete becauseconfounders were not adequately identified and controlled for. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m3 for the respirable dustof talc containing no asbestos fibers and less than 1 percent silica. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers fromthe risk of non-malignant respiratory effects associated with exposureto the dust of non-fibrous talc. With regard to the finding by NIOSH (Dement and Zumwald 1978) of excesscancer deaths among talc workers, OSHA is currently reviewing data describingthe effects of exposure to non-asbestiform varieties of mineral fibersthat are found in talc deposits. OSHA is considering a separate rulemakingto address this issue. In addition, OSHA is proposing to express the limit for talc in mg/m3 ratherthan mppcf, to facilitate employee exposure monitoring. The Agency is proposingthis change for all of its Z table limits that are currently expressedas mppcf.<ITAG tagnum="26">TIN OXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-31-5; Chemical Formula: SnO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1395</ITAG>OSHA currently has no exposure limit for tin oxide. The ACGIH recommendsan exposure limit of 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. Tin oxide may be a whiteor yellow-brown powder. Injection of tin dust intraperitoneally into guinea pigs resulted in anon-specific, well-vascularized chronic granulomatous reaction (Oyanguren,Haddad, and Maass 1958). Chronic exposure to tin oxide fume and dust resultsin stannosis, a form of pneumoconiosis. The fume is considered a more importantsource of stannosis than the dust (Dundon and Hughes 1950), but other authoritiesconsider the quality of the dust and the duration of exposure equally important(Robertson and Whittaker 1954), The onset of the symptoms of stannosismay be delayed for years; the appearance of the condition is signalledby the onset of difficulty in breathing. One worker who had been exposedto unspecified tin oxide levels for 22 years was tested for stannosis andregistered a vital breathing capacity 70 percent of normal and a maximalbreathing capacity 61 percent of the predicted value (Spencer and Wycoff1954). More than 150 cases of stannosis have been reported in the world literature(Robertson and Whittaker 1954). and five cases were reported in the UnitedStates before 1954. No cases of massive fibrosis caused by exposure totin oxide dust or fume have been reported (ACGIH 1986, p. 574). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 2 mg/m3 for tin oxide dust and fume.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the risk of reduced pulmonary capacity and stannosis associated withexposure to this substance in the absence of any OSHA limit. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for tin oxide.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">TRIMELLITIC ANHYDRIDE (TMAN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 552-30-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>4</T2>O<T2>5</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1409</ITAG>OSHA has no exposure limit for trimellitic anhydride. In 1981, the ACGIHset 0.005 ppm (0.04 mg/m3 as the 8-hour TWA limit for this substance. Trimelliticanhydride is a colorless solid. Exposure to trimellitic anhydride (TMAN) causes irritation of the eyes,nose, skin, and pulmonary tract. NIOSH (1978) reported in a Current IntelligenceBulletin that trimellitic anhydride should be considered an extremely toxicworkplace hazard, because exposure to it can cause noncardiac pulmonaryedema and immunological sensitization, as well as upper respiratory tractirritation. Pulmonary edema has occurred in workers exposed to TMAN at unreported airconcentrations; the development of pulmonary edema in these workers withoutupper respiratory tract irritation suggests that TMAN is a sensitizer (Riceet al. 1977). Zeiss and colleagues (1977) described TMAN-related illnessesamong a group of workers synthesizing TMAN. These authors believe thereare three separate syndromes associated with TMAN exposure: Rhinitis/asthma;a flu-like condition; and irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Anothercase of TMAN-related occupational sensitization occurred in a worker exposedduring the application of an epoxy resin coating (Fawcett et al. 1977).At levels averaging 1.5 and 2.8 mg/m\3\ in two processes, NIOSH reportedthat employees reported eye and nose irritation, shortness of breath, coughing,nausea, headache, skin irritation, and throat irritation (NIOSH 1974).Pulmonary hemorrhage and hemolytic anemia have been reported in workersexposed to TMAN at unspecified levels (Ahmed et al. 1979). Rats have shown intralveolar hemorrhage after TMAN exposures to concentrationsof 0.01 ppm. OSHA is proposing to regulate trimellitic anhydride to an 8-hour TWA levelof 0.005 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protectworkers from the severe pulmonary effects, sensitization and skin and upperrespiratory tract irritation observed in workers exposed to this extremelytoxic substance. OSHA believes that this limit will substantially reducethis risk, which is presently not controlled due to the absence of anyOSHA PEL. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing anew limit for trimellitic anhydride. At the time of the final rule. OSHAwill promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">WOOD DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

However, in an enforcementproceeding, wood dust was held not to be an inert mineral dust, and theAgency has subsequently not regulated this substance. Consequently, OSHAhas no current PEL for hard wood or soft wood dust. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 1 mg/m\3\ for hard wood dust, and a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ andSTEL of 10 mg/m\3\ for soft wood dust. Wood dust is defined as any woodparticles arising from the processing or handing of woods. Hard woods derivefrom the deciduous broad-leaved flowering species of trees, and soft woodsinclude the coniferous species that do not shed their leaves in the winter.Exposure to wood dust has long been associated with a variety of adversehealth effects, including dermatitis, allergic respiratory effects, mucosaland non-allergic respiratory effects, and cancer. The toxicity data inanimals are limited, particularly with regard to exposure to wood dustalone. <ITAG tagnum="81">Animal Studies </ITAG>Groups of male guinea pigs were injected intratracheally with suspensionscontaining 75 mg of sheesham or mango wood dust or of hemp or bagasse fibers,or 20 mg of jute fiber (Bhattacharjee et al. 1979; Bhattacharjee and Zaidi1982). Animals were sacrificed serially at intervals up to 90 days afterinjection. Lung examination revealed that, at 90 days, Grade I fibrosisof the lungs had occurred in the guinea pigs injected with mango or jute,while those treated with sheesham or hemp had developed Grade II pulmonaryfibrosis. In another experiment involving guinea pigs, animals were exposed by inhalationto average respirable dust concentrations of 1143 mg/m\3\ for 30 minutes/day,5 days/week for 24 weeks (McMichael et al. 1983). Histopathological examinationshowed lung changes, described by the authors as moderate to severe, inall exposed guinea pigs. The changes seen included an increase in septalconnective tissue components and aggregation of lymphocytes; however, nopulmonary fibrosis or extensive destruction of the parenchymal tissue occurred.The authors of this study concluded that exposure to fir bark dust maycause inflammatory changes in the lung. Two studies examined the effect of exposing Syrian golden hamsters to beechwood dust by inhalation, with or without concurrent administration of theknown carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (Wilhelmsson et al. 1985a, b;Drettner et al. 1985). In each study, the animals were divided into fourseparate groups. In Study 1, there were 12 animals per group. Two groupswere exposed to fresh beech wood dust (a hard wood dust) at a mean totaldust concentration of 15 mg/m\3\ for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 36 weeks,and one of these groups was also given 1.5 mg of DEN once a week for thefirst 12 weeks. The third group in Study 1 was given the DEN doses only(positive control) and the fourth group was given no exposure at all (negativecontrol). In Study II, there were 24 animals in each of four groups. Two groups ofanimals were exposed to fresh beech wood dust at a mean total dust concentrationof 30 mg/m\3\ for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 40 weeks. The positive andnegative control groups were treated as in Study I. In Study I, none of the hamsters had lung or nasal tumors or metaplasia.Four hamsters exposed to wood dust and DEN exhibited squamous cell papillomasof the trachea, as did three animals in the positive control group andone in the negative control group. No differences in organs other thanthe respiratory organs were seen between the treated and control groupsin Study I. In Study II, all DEN-exposed hamsters had nasal lesions ranging from hyperplasiaand dysplasia to papillomas. In addition, half of all DEN-exposed hamstersdeveloped nasal adenocarcinomas, whether or not they had also been exposedto wood dust. Half of the DEN-exposed animals also had papillomas of thelarynx and trachea. In the wood-dust-exposure-only group, two of the animalshad nasal lesions, one of which was an unclassifiable malignant nasal tumorand the other of which consisted of focal metaplasia with mild dysplasia.The authors concluded that exposure to wood dust did not increase the tumorincidence in DEN-exposed animals but did affect the respiratory tract ofall exposed animals. <ITAG tagnum="81">Human Studies </ITAG><T3>Dermatitis. </T3>There are a large number of case reports, epidemiologicalstudies, and other data on the health effects of wood dust exposure inhumans. Dermatitis caused by exposure to wood dusts is common, and canbe caused either by chemical irritation, sensitization (allergic reaction),or either of these together. As many as 300 species of trees have beenimplicated in wood-caused dermatitis. The chemicals associated with allergic reactions are generally found inthe inner parts of a tree, e.g., the heartwood, and the workers most proneto these reactions are those involved in secondary wood processing (carpenters,joiners, finishers). The symptoms of sensitization are redness, scaling, and itching, whichmay progress to vesicular dermatitis and, after repeated exposures, tochronic dermatitis. The parts of the body most often affected are the hands,forearms, eyelids, face, neck, and genitals. This form of dermatitis generallyappears after a few days or weeks of contact. <T3>Allergic Respiratory Effects. </T3>Allergic respiratory responses aremediated by the immune system, as is also the case with allergic dermatitis.Many authors have reported cases of allergic reactions in workers exposedto wood dust (Sosman et al. 1969; Greenberg 1972; Pickering et al. 1972;Eaton 1973; Booth et al. 1976; Chan-Yeung et al. 1978; Edwards et al. 1978;Innocenti and Angotzi 1980; Bush and Clayton 1983; Cartier et al. 1986).Asthma is the most common response to wood dust exposure, and the allergicnature of such reactions has been demonstrated by the presence of lgE antibodiesand positive skin reactions on patch testing. The best-studied of the allergicreactions to wood dust is Western red cedar (WRC) asthma; it is estimatedthat 5 percent of the exposed population is allergic to this wood. However,only one study is available that relates exposure level to ventilatoryfunction. In that study, exposure to concentrations of 2 mg/m\3\ of WRCdust caused significant decreases in forced vital capacity and forced expiratoryvolume (Vedel et al. 1986). These authors also found that exposures toconcentrations above 3 mg/m\3\ produced eye irritation. <T3>Mucosal and Nonallergic Respiratory Effects. </T3>This section discusseschanges in the structure and function of the nasal mucosa and respiratorytract that are caused by exposure to wood dust. These changes include nasaldryness, irritation, bleeding, and obstruction; coughing, wheezing, andsneezing; sinusitis; and prolonged colds. These symptoms have been observedeven at wood dust concentrations below 4 mg/m\3\.Bellion et al. (1964) found that 97 of 225 workers (carpenters, sawmillworkers, woodworkers) exposed from 3 to 24 years to the dust of severaldifferent hard woods showed radiologic evidence of pulmonary abnormalities.Black et al. (1974) studied nine woodworkers from a woodworking factoryin England. In all of these workers, mucociliary movement was markedlydepressed, leading these authors to conclude that exposure to wood dustin the furniture industry for 10 years or more can impair mucociliary clearance.These findings were confirmed in a Danish study involving furniture makers(Solgaard and Andersen 1975; Andersen et al. 1976, 1977); compared withcontrols, the mucociliary transport rate was also significantly impairedin these woodworkers and dose-response effects were noted. A respiratory survey conducted by Chan Yeung et al. (1980) in pulp andpaper mill workers in British Columbia showed that workers exposed to wooddust at a mean total dust concentration of 0.5 mg/m3 had a slight but statisticallysignificant decrease in pulmonary function values compared with controls.The authors concluded that the chemical preservatives used to treat thewood could also have been responsible for these adverse effects. In a cross-sectional survey of 1,157 American woodworkers (both hard andsoft wood), Whitehead et al. (1986) found that exposure to higher (10+mg/years/m3) compared with lower (0-2 mg-years/m3) dust concentrationswas associated with a statistically significant and higher incidence ofdecreased pulmonary function. However, dose-response effects were observedonly for soft wood (i.e., pine) dusts. A later study by Beckman et al.(1981) examined subgroups of the workers studied by Whitehead and foundno correlation between years of exposure to pine wood dust and pulmonaryfunction. In a pilot study of 55 workers in a North Carolina hardwood furniture plant,Goldsmith (1983) found that, at mean area wood dust concentrations of 2mg/m3 or below, peak ventilatory flow correlated significantly with cumulativeperson-years of exposure. Goldsmith interpreted this finding to mean thatinhalation of wood dust may impair large airway function. A study of Italian woodworkers showed that the number of wood-dust-exposedworkers who had developed anosmia (loss of smell) was significantly higherthan in a control group of non-exposed workers (Innocenti et al. 1985).Amoore (1986) confirmed this finding in other workers exposed to hardwooddusts. <T3>Summary of mucosal and nonallergic respiratory effects. </T3>A largenumber of studies have demonstrated that occupational exposure to wooddust causes both statistically significant and non-significant increasesin respiratory symptoms. These symptoms range from irritation to bleeding,wheezing, sinusitis, and prolonged colds. In addition, chronic wood dustexposure reduces the rate of mucociliary transport in the nose and, insome workers, also causes changes in the nasal mucosa. Several studieshave demonstrated decreased pulmonary function among wood-dust-exposedworkers, although other studies have not confirmed these findings. <ITAG tagnum="81">Carcinogenicity </ITAG>The association between occupational exposure to wood dust and variousforms of cancer has been explored in many studies and in many countries.In 1987, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifiedfurniture manufacturing in Category I (confirmed human carcinogen) andcarpentry in category 2B (suspected human carcinogen). The discussion below focuses on selected U.S. studies. <T3>Nasal and Sinus Cavity Cancer. </T3>The earliest U.S. study of wooddust exposure and nasal cancer was conducted by Brinton et al. in 1976.These authors analyzed cancer death rates between 1950 and 1969 in 132U.S. counties having at least 1 percent of their population employed infurniture and wood fixture manufacturing. This study revealed that theage-adjusted mortality rate for cancer of the nasal cavity and sinusesamong white males in the ``furniture'' counties was significantly higherthan in non-furniture counties. In a later case-control study, these authors (Brinton et al. 1984) analyzedcases of nasal and sinus cancers occurring in North Carolina and Virginiabetween 1970 and 1980. This study identified a significantly elevated riskof adenocarcinomas in males working in the furniture manufacturing industry,but no increased risk among lumber, carpentry, or construction workers.There was no significant increase in the risk of squamous cell carcinomain workers from any other wood-related industry. In a study sponsored by the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Task Force, Virenand colleagues (1982) described a death certificate case-control studyof nasal cancer deaths for 1963 to 1977 in North Carolina, Mississippi,Washington, and Oregon. Findings of this study included a relative nasalcancer risk of 1.95 for industries involving lumber and wood products;however, no significant relative risk of nasal cancer was seen for workersin the furniture manufacturing industry. Imbus and Dyson conducted a study of nasal cancer and North Carolina furnitureworkers (1985). This study found: (1) That there was a statistically significantincrease of nasal cancer among furniture workers; (2) that the nasal cancerrates among North Carolina furniture workers were much lower than thosereported for English furniture workers; (3) that the number of nasal cancerdeaths among North Carolina furniture workers decreased between 1956 and1977; and (4) that a slight excess in nasal cancer may have existed amongNorth Carolina furniture workers but is currently either declining or non-existent.At present, the National Cancer Institute is conducting a cohort mortalitystudy of 36,622 workers employed in the wood, metal, and plastic furnituremanufacturing industries (Miller 1987). Results are too preliminary tobe described at this time.<T3>Summary of evidence for nasal and sinus cavity cancers. </T3>NIOSH(1987) concluded that the literature clearly demonstrates an associationbetween occupational wood dust exposure and nasal cancer. English studiesfirst identified this link by showing a 10- to 20-times greater incidenceof nasal adenocarcinoma among woodworkers in the furniture industry thanamong other woodworkers and 100 times greater than in the general population.In the United States, three studies have reported a fourfold risk of nasalcancer or adenocarcinoma in furniture workers, and another study noteda similar relationship between nasal cancer and wood dust exposure. Oneother study failed to find such an association for furniture workers, butdid find an increase among logging and timber industry workers. Althoughhard wood dust has most often been implicated, soft-wood-dust exposurehas also been a risk factor in some studies. In addition, there is someevidence that the development of adenocarcinomas is associated with quantitativelyhigher levels of wood dust exposure and that the risk of this form of cancerincreases with latency from first exposure. <T3>Pulmonary Cancer. </T3>A number of studies investigating the associationbetween wood dust exposure and the development of lung cancer have beenconducted. Milham (1974) found a significant excess of malignant tumorsof the bronchus and lung in workers who had belonged to the AFL-CIO UnitedBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. Only construction workersshowed a statistically significant increase in lung cancer rate. In a study of lung cancer in Florida residents, Blot et al. (1982) foundthat an elevated risk of lung cancer that was statistically significantexisted among workers in the lumber and wood industry and in construction;however, smoking may have been a confounding factor in these results. <T3>Summary of evidence for pulmonary cancer. </T3>The association betweenlung cancer and occupational wood dust exposure is inconclusive, althoughseveral epidemiological studies have reported increases in lung canceramong wood-dust-exposed workers. <T3>Hodgkin's Disease. </T3>The data on the relationship between exposureto wood dust and the development of Hodgkin's disease are conflicting.Milham (1967) and Milham and Hesser (1967) concluded, on the basis of acase-cohort study of 1,549 white males dying of this disease between 1940-1953and 1957-1964, that there was an association between Hodgkin's diseaseand exposure to wood dust. Another study (Spiers 1969) concluded that men working in the wood industriesin the eastern United States were at special risk for Hodgkin's disease,and suggested that pine pollen exposure might be responsible for the increase.A Washington State epidemiological study (Petersen and Milham 1974) alsofound that woodworkers had an increase risk of Hodgkin's disease, and thework of these authors was supported by the results of another study (Guffermanet al. 1976), which showed a non-significant increase in the relative riskfor Hodgkin's disease among woodworkers. <T3>Summary of evidence for Hodgkin's disease. </T3>Although the data areconflicting, several epidemiological studies of U.S. workers do reportincreases in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease among woodworkers. Thisexcess is particularly apparent among carpenters. <T3>Other Cancers. </T3>NIOSH (1987) concluded that the data on the relationshipbetween occupational exposure to wood dust and the development of cancersother than nasal, Hodgkin's disease, or lung cancers are insufficient andinconclusive. <ITAG tagnum="81">Basis for the Proposed Limits </ITAG>OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TwA limit of 1 mg/m3 for hard wood dust anda 5 mg/m3 8-hour TWA and 10 mg/m3 15-minute STEL for soft wood dust. Theselimits reflect evidence in the literature that exposures to these substancescause allergic respiratory effects and eye irritation (Vedal et al. 1986),mucosal and nonallergic respiratory effects (Bellin et al. 1964; Blacket al. 1974; Goldsmith 1983), nasal and sinus cavity cancers (Brinton etal. 1976, 1984; Viren et al. 1982; Imbus and Dyson 1985), and, perhaps,Hodgkin's disease (Milham 1967; Milham and Hesser 1967; Spiers 1969; Petersenand Milham 1974; Gufferman et al. 1976). OSHA preliminarily concludes thatthese limits will protect exposed workers from the risks of the many conditionsand diseases associated with wood dust exposure. However, the Agency notesthat many of the studies described above implicate both hard wood and softwood dusts or do not distinguish between these two substances for cancer,asthma, and dermatitis. OSHA requests information on the health effects,the exposure levels, and the protectiveness of the proposed limits. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit forwood dust. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limitif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Conclusions for All Respiratory Toxicants </ITAG>As Table C6-2 and the discussions above show, limits for substances inthis group have been established to control employee exposures to or belowconcentrations of substances that have been associated with acute or chronicrespiratory effects. For most of these substances, the evidence is sufficientto identify the NOE or low-effect levels that are related to these effectsin humans or animals. Accordingly, OSHA preliminarily concludes that maintainingemployee exposures at or below these limits will greatly decrease the likelihoodthat employees will be at significant risk of respiratory effects whenthey are exposed to these substances in the workplace. Because chronicpulmonary disease caused by exposure to toxic dusts can be incapacitating,such exposures can effectively end the working life of severely affectedindividuals. Less serious pulmonary disease can result in lost work days,both as a result of the associated symptoms themselves and as a consequenceof increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The effects of exposureto acute pulmonary toxins, such as ozone or trimellitic anhydride, rangefrom reduced lung function to life-threatening pulmonary edema. Loweringthe Agency's current limits or establishing limits where none previouslyexisted will substantially reduce these risks. The health evidence forthe substances in this group provides a reasonable basis for revising oradding limits for these substances. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill establish new or revised limits for these respiratory toxins if theAgency determines that these limits will substantially reduce significantrisks.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofCardiovascular Effects </ITAG>Introduction For seven chemicals, OSHA is proposing limits based on their adverse effectson the cardiovascular system. Table C7-1 lists the current Z table limitsfor these substances, along with the ACGIH TLVs, NIOSH RELs, CAS numbersand HS numbers for these substances. For two of these substances, chloropentafluoroethaneand sodium azide, neither OSHA nor NIOSH has current limits. OSHA is proposingto replace its current ceiling limits for two substances (ethylene glycoldinitrate and nitroglycerin) with lower short-term limits. OSHA is proposingto reduce its current TWA-PEL for carbon disulfide to 1 ppm. For one othersubstance (fluorotrichloromethane), OSHA is proposing to replace its currentTWA-PEL with a ceiling value. For the remaining substance (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane),OSHA proposes to add a STEL to its existing 8-hour TWA. For three substancesin this group, NIOSH recommends limits substantially lower than those establishedby the ACGIH. Description of the Health Effects Although the cardiovascular system can be adversely affected in many differentways by exposure to toxic substances, the adverse effects caused by exposureto the seven chemicals in Table C7-1 are limited to three categories: (1)Cardiac sensitization, (2) vasodilation, and (3) atherosclerosis. Cardiac sensitization is not related to the type of sensitization thatis mediated by the immune system and that causes an allergic reaction.Instead, it results when a chemical ``sensitizes'' the heart to the effectsof a class of biological compounds called sympathomimetic amines. The physiologicalaction of sympathomimetic amines is to stimulate the heart to beat faster.The hormone adrenaline, also called epinephrine, is an example of a sympathomimeticamine. It is normally secreted into the bloodstream when the body anticipatesan increase in physical exertion, such as occurs when someone is frightened.A concentration of epinephrine equal to or higher than the noe-ffect levelfor this substance is necessary to increase the heartbeat rate in exposedindividuals. The effect of a cardiac sensitizer is to lower the no-effectlevel so that the heartbeat rate is stimulated by a lower concentrationof adrenaline.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2418-419</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>The region of the heart that becomes sensitized is the pacemaking and conductionsystem, which determines the rhythm and rate of the heartbeat. Unregulatedor unnecessary interference with this region of the heart can result inarrhythmia, an abnormality in the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat (Wyngaardenand Smith 1985). The clinical consequences of an arrhythmia vary amongindividuals. A young person with a healthy heart may not be adversely orseriously affected. However, fatal arrhythmias have occurred in healthyyoung people, and in older people or individuals whose cardiovascular systemshave already been compromised, arrhythmias can cause symptoms of cerebralor myocardial ischemia, shock, or congestive heart failure. Vasodilators are compounds that cause blood vessels to expand, resultingin a decrease in blood pressure (hypotension) and a decrease in the amountof blood reaching the organs. Acute hypotension is a common cause of shock(Petersdorf et al. 1983). Chronic hypotension may result in a number ofsymptoms, including lethargy, weakness, easy fatigability, and dizzinessor faintness. Atherosclerosis is a serious disease produced by a degenerative processin the arteries. Plaques containing lipids, complex carbohydrates, bloodproducts, and calcium form on the inside walls of arteries, usually onmajor blood vessels. These plaques are also called atheromas; their presencemakes arteries narrower. Depending on which arteries in the body containatheromas, different clinical consequences may result, including renalhypertension, stroke, and myocardial ischemia (inadequate circulation ofblood to the myocardium) (Balazs et al. 1986). Some chemicals can enhanceor accelerate the formation of atheromas and thereby encourage the developmentof atherosclerosis, a major cause of coronary heart disease. Dose-Response Relationships and Cardiac Effects For four of the chemicals in Table C7-1 (carbon disulfide, ethylene glycoldinitrate, nitroglycerin, and sodium azide), the ACGIH-recommended limitsare based primarily on health surveys and case reports indicating thatoccupationally exposed workers subjected to concentrations above a no-effectlevel experience these cardiovascular effects. Human data for the otherthree chemicals (chloropentafluoroethane, fluorotrichloromethane, and 1,1,2-trichloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane),however, are scarce. For these chemicals, limits are based on the resultsof studies in laboratory animals. Chemically induced cardiovascular disease occurs in a pattern that appearsto correspond to a typical effect level dose-response relationship. Thatis, an exposure level and exposure duration exist below which the substanceappears unlikely to exert an adverse effect. Thus, the limits for substancesin this group are designed to maintain exposures below this apparent no-effectlevel.The following discussions describe OSHA's preliminary findings for somesubstances in this group and point to the seriousness of the cardiovasculareffects potentially associated with exposure to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="26">CARBON DISULFIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-15-0: Chemical Formula: CS<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1070</ITAG>The current OSHA PELs for carbon disulfide include a TWA of 20 ppm, a STELof 30 ppm, and a ceiling of 100 ppm. The ACGIH has recommended a TLV-TWAfor this substance of 10 ppm without a ceiling or STEL, but with a skinnotation, and NIOSH recommends a 1-ppm TWA and a 10-ppm 15-minute ceiling.The serious adverse effects of exposure to carbon disulfide on the cardiovascularand neurological systems have been documented for decades (ACGIH 1986).Evidence has accumulated indicating that even exposure to low levels ofcarbon disulfide exerts harmful effects on the cardiovascular and neurologicalsystems of occupationally exposed populations. The current PEL of 20 ppm(i.e., the 1968 ACGIH TLV) was established primarily to prevent neurologicaldisturbances. Since that time, carbon disulfide has been implicated asa risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease at the 20-ppmPEL. The cardiovascular effects of exposure to carbon disulfide have been welldocumented in three studies. Tiller et al. (1968), Tolonen et al. (1975),and Tolonen et al. (1979) all identified exposure to carbon disulfide asa contributing factor in coronary heart disease. The latter two studieswere epidemiological investigations in Finland in which viscose rayon workerswere exposed to low levels of carbon disulfide for at least 5 years; attimes, they were exposed to high carbon disulfide concentrations. Mihail et al. (1968) observed ``significant vascular, nervous and biochemicalchanges'' in workers exposed to an average carbon disulfide concentrationof 9 ppm for 2 years. According to the ACGIH (1986) and NIOSH (1977b),other studies have reported cardiovascular disorders among the effectsof carbon disulfide exposure at levels between 10 and 40 ppm. Several other studies demonstrate that exposure to carbon disulfide isassociated with the development of neurological symptoms, including nervousness,irritability, indigestion, bizarre dreams, insomnia, excessive fatigue,loss of appetite, and headache. More severe symptoms such as psychosis,polyneuritis, and tremors have also been reported (Vigliani 1954; Gordiand Trumper 1938). Seppalainen and Tolonen (1974) conducted a neurological study on a subgroupof the same workers whose exposure to carbon disulfide at levels between10 and 30 ppm was considered a contributing factor to coronary heart disease(Tolonen et al. 1975; 1979). They reported an increased incidence of pathologicallyreduced nerve conduction velocities and abnormal electroencephalogramsin exposed workers relative to unexposed workers. The observed decreasesin nerve conduction velocity were believed by these researchers to be irreversible.Several scientists have urged that the exposure limits for carbon disulfidebe reduced; Gordi and Trumper (1938) and Kleinfeld and Tabershaw (1955)all advocated a TWA of 10 ppm for carbon disulfide on the basis of itsadverse neurological effects. In light of these recommendations and thereports of adverse cardiovascular effects in workers exposed to ``relativelylow concentrations,'' the ACGIH (1986) recommended a TLV of 10 ppm TWA.However, NIOSH (1977) considered 10 ppm to be the ``lowest concentrationcausing demonstrated adverse health effects'' (p. 137), and believed itnecessary to apply a safety factor because ``coronary heart disease frequentlyresults in sudden death'' (p. 137). Therefore, NIOSH recommended a 10-hourTWA of 1 ppm with a 15-minute short-term limit of 10 ppm with a 15-minuteshort-term limit of 10 ppm to protect against acute neurological effectsassociated with exposure to high concentrations of carbon disulfide. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the epidemiological studies showing neurologicaland cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to 9 ppm and to between10 and 40 ppm demonstrate that a risk exists at the current OSHA TWA PELof 20 ppm for carbon disulfide. OSHA believes that the reduction of thecurrent PEL from 20 ppm to a 1-ppm TWA and a 10-ppm 15-minute STEL is essentialto reduce the risk of adverse effects on the cardiovascular and neurologicalsystems caused by exposure to carbon disulfide at the existing PEL. Becausethere are reports of cardiovascular and biochemical changes at levels belowthe ACGIH's limit, the 10-ppm TLV does not provide adequate protection.OSHA is proposing the NIOSH recommendations of a 1-ppm TWA and a 10-ppmSTEL as the permissible exposure limits. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for carbon disulfide if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLOROPENTAFLUOROETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-15-3; Chemical Formula: ClCF<T2>2</T2>CF<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. NO. 1087</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for chloropentafluoroethane (FC-115); the ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm for this colorless, odorless gas. Chloropentafluoroethane vapors have rather low acute toxicity. In dogsand rats, gastrointestinal absorption following intragastric intubationhas been shown to be minimal (Terrill 1974; Clayton, Hood, Nick, and Waritz1966). The inhalation toxicity for this compound is very low; rats exposedto 800,000 ppm for 4 hours showed no clinical or histopathologic effects(Clayton, Hood, Nick, and Waritz 1966). Rats and guinea pigs showed noadverse clinical effects at inhalation levels of 600,000 ppm for 2 hours(Weigand 1971), and guinea pigs exposed to 200,000 ppm for varying intervalsalso exhibited no adverse signs (Breen and Wallis 1963). Rats, mice, rabbitsand dogs have also demonstrated that FC-115 has a very low subchronic inhalationtoxicity. These species have tolerated 6-hour daily exposures of 100,000ppm for 90 days without adverse effects (Clayton, Hood, Nick, and Waritz1971), and laboratory animals have tolerated doses of 200,000 ppm for 3.5hours daily, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks (Weigand 1971). The potentialfor cardiac sensitization appears to be very low for FC-115; only one of13 unanesthetized dogs showed cardiac sensitization after exposure to 150,000ppm intravenously (Trochimoicz, Azar, Terrill, and Mullin 1974). However,several other studies indicate that unanesthetized dogs, rats, and monkeysreceiving dosages between 100,000 ppm and 200,000 ppm may show increasedblood pressure, accelerated heart rate, myocardial depression, or alteredpulmonary effects under certain conditions (Belej and Aviado 1975; Friedman,Cammarato, and Aviado 1973; Aviado and Belej 1975). There are no reportsof mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic toxicities in these studies.OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit of 1000 ppmfor chloropentafluoroethane. The Agency preliminarily concludes that thislimit will protect workers from the risk of cardiac effects at the extremelyhigh levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for chloropentafluoroethane.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYLENE GLYCOL DINITRATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 628-96-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>H<T2>4</T2>(NO<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

No. 1290</ITAG>The current OSHA PELs for ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN) and nitroglycerin(NG) are ceilings of 0.2 ppm (1 mg/m\3\ and 2 mg/m\3\, respectively, withskin notations). The ACGIH (1986) has established a TWA of 0.05 ppm (0.3mg/m\3\) for EGDN and a TWA of 0.05 ppm (0.05 mg/m\3\) for NG, both withskin notations, to protect against the hypotension and headaches causedin occupationally exposed populations by the vasodilatory effects of thesesubstances. NIOSH recommends a 20-minute ceiling of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for bothof these substances.Most occupational exposures to EGDN actually involve mixtures of EGDN andnitroglycerin (NG). Because EGDN is 160 times more volatile than nitroglycerin,and most of the mixtures of these two substances used in industry consistof 60 to 80 percent EGDN, the adverse effects associated with inhalationof such mixtures can be attributed primarily to EGDN. Trainor and Jones (1966) reported that exposure to EGDN:NG at a level of0.7 mg/m\3\ for 25 minutes was sufficient to produce decreased blood pressureand a slight headache in humans. The authors also reported that workersat a munitions plant developed headaches when exposed to EGDN:NG concentrationsbetween 0.1 and 0.53 mg/m\3\ (0.36 mg/m\3\ average). Morikawa et al. (1967)found that workers in an explosives plant exposed to low concentrationsof EGDN:NG (0.066 ppm was the highest average level) had a much higherincidence of abnormal pulse waves than controls (143 out of 1,271 versus0 out of 175). (Abnormal pulse waves often indicate a clinically significantdefect in the functioning of the heart and/or circulatory system (Braunwald1978).) In its Criteria Document for NG and EGDN, NIOSH (1978b) refers to a reportof a dynamite worker who died when exposed to EGDN:NG concentrations between0.3 and 1.4 mg/m\3\, and to another report of two workers who died suddenlyfollowing exposure to EGDN:NG at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 2.7mg/m\3\. NIOSH (1978) observed that skin absorption may have contributedsignificantly to these deaths. Based on the evidence described above, the ACGIH recommended a 0.05-ppmTLV-TWA and a 0.1-ppm TLV-STEL in 1981. Because the studies relied on wereprimarily reports of adverse effects resulting from chronic exposure, ACGIHadopted the TLV-TWA without the STEL in 1983. After reviewing the sameevidence, NIOSH (1978) concluded that exposure to EGDN:NG should be controlledto a level below that associated with vasodilation, which is the most sensitiveindicator of toxicity. Relying primarily on the Trainor and Jones (1966)study, NIOSH concluded that workers exposed to or below 0.1 mg/m\3\ willnot develop vasodilation, as indicated by the development of headache.Because vasodilation and associated headache were found to occur even onshort-term exposure to EGDN:NG, NIOSH recommended a 20-minute short-termlimit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ approximately 0.01 ppm). Hypotension and headache have been observed in populations exposed below0.5 mg/m\3\, and fatalities have occurred at EGDN:NG exposures of between0.3 and 1.4 mg/m\3\ in one instance, and between 1.7 and 2.7 mg/m\3\ inanother. OSHA's existing standard is 0.3 mg/m\3\, as is the ACGIH TLV.Since worker deaths have occurred at or near the current PEL, OSHA proposesadoption of the more stringent 0.1-mg/m\3\ (0.01-ppm) NIOSH short-termlimit as the PEL to prevent fatalities and protect against adverse healtheffects. It should be noted that toxicity can be produced readily throughthe skin, and therefore the recommended environmental limit is protectiveonly if skin contact is prevented. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethylene glycol dinitrate andnitroglycerin if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">FLUOROTRICHLOROMETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-69-4; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>3</T2>F </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1180</ITAG>Fluorotrichloromethane, also known as FC-11, is a member of a large familyof chemicals, the chlorofluorocarbons. The current OSHA PEL is an 8-hourTWA of 1000 ppm. NIOSH has no REL for fluorotrichloromethane. OSHA proposesthat the standard be revised to a ceiling limit of 1000 ppm, which correspondsto the current ACGIH TLV for this substance. Inhalation of large doses of FC-11 has caused cardiac sensitization anddeath in humans. Experimental mice that inhaled aerosol containing 10 percentFC-11 exhibited cardiac arrhythmias. In the same study, dogs that inhaledaerosol containing 2.5 percent FC-11 had decreased myocardial function;monkeys that inhaled an aerosol containing 5 percent FC-11 developed tachycardiaand hypotension (NRC 1977). Exposure to 5000 ppm FC-11 has induced cardiac sensitization and arrhythmiain dogs that were intravenously injected with epinephrine (Reinhardt, Azar,Maxfield et al. 1971). Jenkins, Jones, Coon, and Siegel (1970) found thatfour species of animals (monkeys, dogs, rats, and guinea pigs) sufferedno ill effects after 90 days of continuous exposure to 1000 ppm FC-11.Because 1000 ppm appears to represent a no-effect level for FC-11, OSHArecommends a ceiling of 1000 ppm, which will provide workers with a greatermargin of safety against cardiac sensitization than the Agency's current1000-ppm 8-hour TWA. The cardiac sensitization exhibited by FC-11-exposedanimals is an acute effect. OSHA's current 1000-ppm TWA PEL would permitworkers to be exposed to short-term concentrations of FC-11 that are sufficientlyhigh to sensitize the heart to sympathomimetic amines. Accordingly, OSHAfinds that, at the current limit, workers are at risk of experiencing arrhythmia.Reducing this to a 1000-ppm ceiling limit (the observed no-effect levelin animals) should ensure that no worker is placed at risk of cardiac sensitizationas a result of exposure to FC-11. Therefore OSHA is proposing to reviseits 1000-ppm TWA-PEL for this substance to a 1000-ppm ceiling value. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forfluorotrichloromethane if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">SODIUM AZIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 26628-22-8; Chemical Formula: NaN<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1364</ITAG>There is no current OSHA PEL for sodium azide and NIOSH also has no RELfor this substance. The ACGIH (1986) recommends ceiling limits of 0.1 ppmfor sodium azide (as hydrazoic acid vapor), or 0.3 mg/m\3\ as NaN<T2>3</T2>). Sodium azide is known to produce hypotension in laboratory animals andhumans. An intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg has been reported to lower bloodpressure in cats (Graham 1949). In the 1950s, the medicinal usefulnessof sodium azide as a hypotensive agent was tested in 30 hypertensive patients.Their hypertension was reduced, but observed side effects included headaches;in addition, 20 of 30 patients developed increased sensitivity to sodiumazide, necessitating a reduction in the dose (Black et al. 1954). Acute inhalation by humans of hydrazoic acid vapor (which forms when sodiumazide contacts water) results in lowered blood pressure, eye irritation,bronchitis, headache, weakness, and collapse (Fairhall et al. 1943; Graham1949). The exposure levels that produce these effects were not reportedby these authors. Haas and Marsh (1970) report that exposure to concentrationsof hydrazoic acid vapor as low as 0.5 ppm ``cause some discomfort to laboratorypersonnel.'' Because of its hypotensive effect in humans, OSHA believes that a limitshould be established for sodium azide that will reduce the risk posedto workers at the previously uncontrolled levels of this substance permittedin the workplace. To reduce this risk substantially, OSHA is proposingto establish a ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm HN<T2>3 </T2>(0.3 mg/m\3\ NAN<T2>3</T2>) for sodium azide. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for sodium azide. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">1,1,2-TRICHLORO-1,2,2-TRIFLUOROETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-13-1; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>2</T2>FCClF<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1403</ITAG>1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (FC-113) is a member of the chlorofluorocarbonfamily. The current OSHA PEL is an 8-hour TWA of 1000 ppm. The ACGIH hasan 8-hour TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 1250 ppm. NIOSH hasno REL for 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane. Cardiac sensitization following the administration of epinephrine is themost significant effect observed after exposure to FC-113. Reinhardt, Mullin,and Maxfield (1973) observed that 10 out of 29 dogs exposed to 5000 ppmFC-113 for 5 minutes and simultaneously injected with epinephrine developedserious arrhythmias. Similar experiments in which the dogs were exposedto 2000 to 2500 ppm of this substance for longer periods of time (fromone-half to 6 hours) and administered epinephrine resulted occasionallyin arrhythmia (Aviado 1975). However, when the experiment was repeatedusing four 6-hour exposures to 1000 ppm in conjunction with an injectionof epinephrine, no arrhythmias were observed.A study by Stopps and McLaughlin (1967) of human volunteers revealed thatexposure to 2500 ppm FC-113 resulted in impairment of psychomotor performance(described as loss of ability to concentrate and lethargy). This effectwas not observed at concentrations below 2500 ppm. The evidence described above demonstrates that FC-113 can exert toxic effectsat levels of exposure comparable to the levels that are permitted by excursionsabove the current OSHA TWA of 1000 ppm; thus, current levels pose a riskof cardiac sensitization to exposed workers. OSHA finds that a STEL of1250 ppm will provide a wider margin of safety against cardiac sensitizationand impaired psychomotor performance by limiting the potentially high,short-term exposures currently permitted by the 8-hour TWA. OSHA believesthat establishing a STEL of 1250 ppm will reduce this risk of FC-113-inducedcardiovascular toxicity. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis forproposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill establish a new limit for 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane ifthe Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. Preliminary Conclusions Of all the physiological systems, the cardiovascular system is especiallyvulnerable to occupational hazards because cardiovascular diseases arealready so prevalent in our society. According to Levy (1985), ``an estimated40 million Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.'' The majorrisk factors, as revealed by epidemiology, are age, male sex, hypertension,cigarette smoking, the existence of low-density and high-density plasmalipoproteins, cholesterol, and diabetes (Levy 1985). Many American workersexposed to the chemicals grouped here on the basis of their cardiovasculareffects have one or more of these risk factors and are therefore particularlysusceptible to exposure to cardiovascular toxicants. Although the preciseinteractions among these risk factors and exposures to cardiovascular toxinsare difficult to demonstrate with accuracy, few would argue that they donot occur. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the potential for cardiovascular systemdamage associated with exposure to these cardiac sensitizers, vasodilators,and atherosclerosis-causing substances poses a risk to employees in a broadrange of workplaces. The effects experienced by exposed workers range fromarrhythmia, low blood pressure, stroke, and blockage of the flow of bloodto the myocardium. Reducing the exposure limits for these cardiovasculartoxins from levels where such effects could occur to concentrations wheretheir occurrence is unlikely will substantially reduce these risks. OSHAbelieves that the health evidence for these cardiovascular toxins formsa reasonable basis for proposing new or revised limits. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish new or revised limits for these substancesif the Agency determines that such limits will substantially reduce significantrisk. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofSystemic Toxicity </ITAG>Introduction For a number of substances, OSHA's proposed limits are based primarilyon evidence that exposure to these substances is associated with generalsystemic toxicity. This group of substances is unique among the groupingsdiscussed so far in that no single low-dose target organ system can beidentified for these chemicals. Instead, these substances have been showneither to affect several organ systems simultaneously or to cause a varietyof nonspecific adverse signs and symptoms that are indicative of generaltoxicity. The 33 substances belonging to this group and their CAS numbers, HS numbers,current PELs, ACGIH TLVs, and RELs are shown in Table C8-1. OSHA is proposingto establish exposure limits for 17 substances in this group for whichthere are currently no Z table limits. OSHA is also proposing to retainthe Agency's PELs for eight substances and to add STELs to them. For fivesubstances, OSHA is proposing to lower its existing TWA PELs. For two additionalsubstances that have existing TWA PELs, OSHA is proposing to delete theTWA PELs and to adopt ceiling values instead. For one remaining substance,OSHA is proposing to delete its existing ceiling limit and to adopt a newTWA PEL. NIOSH recommends limits for 11 of the substances that differ insome respects from the ACGIH TLVs. Description of the Health Effects For each substance included in this grouping, limits have been establishedto protect against a variety of adverse exposure-related effects that aremanifested at multiple target organ sites. In some instances, the natureof the toxic effects associated with exposure is well-defined and clearlyunderstood (for example, CNS depression, histological organ changes, embryotoxicity.methemoglobinemia, conjunctivitis). The effects of exposure to other substancesin this group, however, have been demonstrated only by such nonspecificindicators as weight loss or decreased weight gain, lethargy, loss of appetite,nervousness, or gastrointestinal disturbances. Although the specificityof the systemic effect caused by exposure to the substances in this groupmay vary, all of these substances have been shown to be biologically activein mammalian species, to interfere significantly with biological processes,and to impair normal organ function. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 004 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 435-438 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Table C8-2 summarizes the toxic effects reported in humans and experimentalanimals to support the establishment of limits for these substances. Thistable shows the variety of adverse health effects that adoption of theproposed limits will minimize or prevent. The table also shows that, forthe vast majority of substances in this group, the risks of exposure havebeen defined in studies of humans or animals and are known to include respiratoryeffects, neurological effects, adverse effects on the reproductive system,organ damage, hematopoietic effects, sensitization, and mucosal irritation.All of these effects are indicative of generalized systemic effects ratherthan localized effects occurring at the site of chemical contact. Dose-Response Relationships and Systemic Effects As Table C8-2 shows, adverse toxic reactions have been reported to occurin humans for 18 of the 33 substances in this group; thus, for more thanhalf of these substances, it has been established conclusively that exposureis associated with adverse health effects in humans. Experimental animaldata comprise the principal evidence for the toxicologic action of theremaining substances. As is the case for many substances for which limitsare being proposed, apparent no-observed effect levels, supplemented bythe use of an additional safety factor to take more sensitive individualsinto account, provide the basis for setting limits. The systemic toxiceffects caused by exposure to substances in this group appear to followan NOE dose-response pattern. That is, as intensity and/or duration ofexposure decreases, the severity of the effect on organ systems also decreasesuntil a point is reached where there is no detectable effect, at leastat observable levels, on organ systems at or below the NOE level. No-effectexposure levels have been identified in humans and animals for severalof the substances in this group; where no-effect levels have been identified(i.e., for diglycidyl ether and phenylphosphine), they have provided theprimary basis for the proposed limits.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s100,r100,r150 </C><T4>Table C</T4>8-2._<T4>Summary of Adverse Health Effects Reported for Substances ProducingGeneral Systemic Toxicity </T4><H1>H.S.

The following discussions describe OSHA preliminary findings for thesesystemic toxicants.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACETONITRILE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-05-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1005</ITAG>Acetonitrile is most widely used in industry as a specialty solvent andchemical intermediate. The current occupational exposure limit for acetonitrileis a 40-ppm TWA. The ACGIH has recommended a 40-ppm TLV-TWA with a 60-ppmTLV-STEL, in addition to a skin notation. NIOSH (1978) has also evaluatedthe toxicity of acetonitrile and has recommended a TWA limit of 20 ppm.The only human evidence describing the toxic effects associated with exposureto acetonitrile is a report by Pozzani et al. (1959), who exposed humansubjects to acetonitrile vapor. None of three subjects exposed to 40 ppmfor 4 hours reported any adverse responses during the exposure period,but one subject experienced slight tightness of the chest a few hours aftertermination of exposure as well as a cooling sensation in the lungs thefollowing day. None of the subjects had elevated blood cyanide levels;one subject showed a slightly elevated urinary thiocyanate level. Pozzaniet al. (1959) also exposed two subjects to 80 ppm and 160 ppm of acetonitrilefor 4 hours. Subjects exposed to 80 ppm reported no adverse response. Onesubject exposed to 160 ppm experienced slight flushing of the face andchest tightness a few hours after exposure (Pozzani et al. 1959). In animal studies, acetonitrile has been found to be embryotoxic and teratogenicin rodents only at exposure levels sufficiently high to cause maternaltoxicity (Berteau et al. 1982; Willhite 1983). A 13-week inhalation studyconducted by the National Toxicology Program (Hazelton Laboratories 1983)found pathological changes in the liver and some blood changes in miceand rats exposed to concentrations of 400 ppm acetonitrile. The human study by Pozzani et al. (1959) provides the primary basis forboth the ACGIH's 40-ppm TWA and 60-ppm STEL and NIOSH's REL of 20 ppm (TWA).In addition to this study, NIOSH (1978) cites a report by Amdur (1959),who investigated an incident in which 16 painters became ill (with onedeath) after using an acetonitrile-containing material in a confined space.Amdur (1959) reported no further incidents after adequate ventilation wasinstalled and acetonitrile levels were maintained at about 17 ppm. NIOSHconcluded that exposure to 40 ppm ``produced minimal effects, whereas noobservable effects were produced in humans at 17 ppm'' (NIOSH 1978, p.97). Therefore, NIOSH recommended that exposure not exceed 20 ppm as a10-hour TWA. OSHA proposes a 20-ppm PEL for acetonitrile. Minor health effects havebeen reported at the 40-ppm TLV-TWA (with a 60-ppm STEL) level; the identificationof 17 ppm as a no-effect level is a major consideration in selection ofthe 20-ppm REL value that the Agency proposes to adopt. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for acetonitrileif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. OSHA's preliminary feasibility analysis is based on limited dataat this level, and additional feasibility information is requested fromthe public.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 50-78-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>COOH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1006</ITAG>There is no current OSHA limit or NIOSH REL for acetylsalicylic acid. TheACGIH has established a TLV of 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA. The work of O'Brien (1968) reports that a normal therapeutic dose of 600mg aspirin will interfere with platelet aggregation in exposed subjectsfor a period of five days or more. Hart (1947) also reported that 150 mgis the smallest oral dose of acetylsalicylic acid that will produce thiseffect. Unpublished data from the Dow Chemical Company (cited in ACGHIH1986, p. 10) indicate that aspirin concentrations exceeding 100 mg/m\3\are tolerated except for occasional skin irritation. However, no data areavailable on the long-term effects on organ systems of inhalation exposureto aspirin. Secondary sources report that aspirin is an acute irritantto the gastric mucosa and respiratory tract. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ for acetylsalicylic acid.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will prevent blood effectsand gastric and respiratory irritation, and proposes to protect workersfrom these adverse effects by reducing this uncontrolled risk. This healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for acetylsalicylicacid. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit ifthe Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALUMINUM (WELDING FUMES) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: Al </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1019</ITAG>OSHA currently has no permissible exposure limits for aluminum weldingfume. The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\. Aluminum welding fumes are produced by arc-welding in a protective, inertatmosphere such as argon. Some aluminum fume is created by these arcs,as is an intense radiation that can produce ozone. Because workers exposedto arc welding fumes have previously not been protected by a permissibleexposure limit. OSHA proposes a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA for these weldingfumes. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protectwelders and other workers in the vicinity of the welding from exposureto the significant irritation potentially associated with inhalation ofthese fumes. This health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for aluminum (welding fumes). At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">2-BUTOXYETHANOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-76-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1046</ITAG>OSHA's current permissible exposure limit for 2-butoxyethanol, one of thefamily of substances known as the glycol ethers, is 50 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, with a skin notation. The ACGIH recommends a limit of 25 ppm TWA,also with a skin notation, for this colorless liquid with a mild etherodor. 2-Butoxyethanol has long been known to be toxic, with early studies indicatingthat a single 7-hour exposure to 700 ppm was lethal to laboratory animals(Werner, Mitchel, Miller et al. 1943). Exposures near the lethal levelcaused systemic toxicity in the form of hemoglobinuria and lung, kidney,and liver changes. Carpenter and associates (1956) reported hemolytic anemiaand increased fragility of the red blood cells in rats repeatedly exposedto 2-butoxyethanol at 320 ppm for 5 weeks. However, repeated exposure for12 weeks at 400 ppm was only slightly injurious to dogs (Werner, Mitchell,Miller et al. 1943). Humans appear to be less susceptible to butoxyethanol poisoning than experimentalanimals. In humans, several single 8-hour exposures at levels of 200 ppmand 100 ppm caused urinary excretion of butoxyacetic acid. However, thesesubjects experienced irritation and discomfort after these exposures (Carpenter,Pozzani, Weil et al. 1956). However, a recent study has confirmed thatthe increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility observed in rats exposed tomany of the glycol ethers is a very sensitive indicator of toxicity andcorrelates with the development of hemoglobinuria at higher exposure levels(Moffett, Linnett, and Blair 1976). These findings indicate that the no-effectlevel in animals is approximately 25 ppm. The ACGIH suggests that 2-butoxyethanol'stoxicity may be more likely to occur as a result of skin absorption thanas a consequence of inhalations (ACGIH 1986, p. 71). OSHA preliminarily concludes that the current PEL of 50 ppm is insufficientlyprotective against the risk of 2-butoxyethanol's hematological effects.The proposed limit of 25 ppm will reduce this risk to a level below thatat which these toxic effects have been observed. This health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for 2-butoxyethanolif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">n-BUTYL GLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2426-08-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>OH<T2>2</T2>CHOCH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1052</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for n-butyl glycidyl ether is 50 ppm TWA. The ACGIH-recommendedTLV is 25 ppm; NIOSH has recommended that occupational exposure to n-butylglycidyl ether not exceed 5.6 ppm as a 15-minute short-term level. OSHA's current PEL of 50 ppm, which was adopted from the ACGIH's 1968 TLVlist, was based on a Dow Chemical Company report (cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 81) that showed that repeated applications of n-butyl glycidyl etherto the skin of humans caused irritation and sensitization; at the time,the ACGIH concluded that a limit of 50 ppm would prevent these irritationresponses. The ACGIH proposed to reduce the TLV to 25 ppm in 1978, notingthat the 50-ppm limit was only 13 times lower than the 8-hour LC<T2>50</T2> (670 ppm) reported for this chemical in rats and that a widermargin of safety was desirable. The NIOSH limit of 5.6 ppm was recommended in the Institute's June 1978Criteria Document on Glycidyl Ethers. This limit was based, in large part,on mutagenic studies conducted in microbial and mammalian test systems,as well as some evidence for other glycidyl ethers that exposure is associatedwith testicular atrophy and hematopoietic abnormalities in laboratory animals.After publication of its Criteria Document, NIOSH received a confidentialreport prepared for the Shell Development Company by Anderson et al. (1957),who had conducted a rat inhalation study. In the research, rats were exposedto 38 ppm, 75 ppm, 150 ppm, or 300 ppm for seven hours daily, 5 days perweek for 10 weeks. Atrophic testes were found in 5 of 10 rats exposed to300 ppm, very small testes were found in 1 of 10 rats exposed to 150 ppm,and patchy atrophy was found in 1 of 10 rats exposed to 75 ppm. No effectswere observed in rats exposed at 38 ppm. Based on this additional evidence,NIOSH reaffirmed its REL for n-butyl glycidyl ether in a Current IntelligenceBulletin published in October, 1978. The NIOSH REL of 5.6 ppm (15-minute STEL) is based on in-vitro testingof microbial and mammalian systems, and extensive extrapolation of thesedata is required to predict effects in humans. The 25-ppm TLV is basedon an increased factor of safety applied to the LC<T2>50 </T2>rate determined in animal studies and is below the observedno-effect level of 38 ppm. OSHA therefore proposes that a PEL of 25 ppmTWA be adopted to protect exposed workers from the serious adverse effectsof butyl glycidyl ether exposure. This health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for n-butyl glycidly ether if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CAPTAN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 133-06-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>8</T2>Cl<T2>3</T2>NO<T2>2</T2>S </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1067</ITAG>OSHA does not currently regulate captan. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 5 mg/m\3\ for this substance, which is a white, crystalline, odorlesssolid. Skin applications of 900 mg/kg captan produce skin irritation in experimentalanimals. Long-term feeding studies did not reveal adverse effects in dogsfed captan in the diet at levels of 100 mg/kg/day for 66 weeks or in ratsfed 1000 mg/kg/day for 2 years (Martin 1971; Spencer 1968). Male mice showeddecreased fertility at levels of 50 or 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days (Collins1972). Studies on the mutagenicity of captan indicate that the substance actsas an alkylating agent and induces chromosome rearrangements in rats andpoint mutations in <T3>Neurospora crassa </T3>(Epstein and Legator, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 98). Legator and colleagues (1969) reported that concentrations of 10ug/ml inhibited DNA in human embryo cells, and concentrations of 1.5 ug/mlproduced chromosomal aberrations in somatic and germ cells of kangaroorats. Animal evidence concerning carcinogenicity is contradictory, althoughhigh doses caused significant incidences of polypoid carcinoma of the duodenumin mice, as well as adenomatous polyps (NCI 1977). Some exposed individuals experience skin irritation (Spencer 1968). A caseof recurrent urticaria caused by captan exposure has been reported andconfirmed (Croy 1973), and captan exhibited high reactivity when administeredin a battery of patch tests (Rudner 1977). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA to protect workers exposed tocaptan from the risk of skin irritation and reproductive effects associatedwith exposure to this previously unregulated substance. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for captan. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLOROPRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 126-99-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>:CClCH:CH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1088</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for chloroprene is 25 ppm TWA with a skin notation.The ACGIH has recommended a 10-ppm TLV-TWA, with a skin notation, and NIOSH(1977c) recommended a limit of 1 ppm, measured over a 15-minute period.The ACGIH recommended a reduction in the TLV from 25 ppm to 10 ppm in 1981based on a review of the world literature by Trochimowicz, who preparedthe 1980 ACGIH proposed documentation, and by Reinhardt (personal communication1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 135). Reinhardt concluded that there wasno evidence indicating a lack of safety associated with the 25-ppm TLV,but ``minimal systemic effects'' (i.e., growth retardation) seen in ratsand hamsters exposed to 39 ppm for 4 weeks or 50 ppm for a lifetime suggestthat an additional margin of safety was in order. Therefore, the ACGIHreduced the TLV-TWA to 10 ppm. In recommending a 1-ppm 15-minute exposure limit, NIOSH (1977c) cited threereports on plants in the Soviet Union. Katosova (1973) reported findinga significant excess of chromosomal abnormalities in the blood of workersexposed to approximately 5 ppm chloroprene. Volkova et al. (1976) reportedsimilar findings in a plant where chloroprene levels ranged from 0.8 to1.95 ppm. In the third study, Sanotskii (1976) reported abnormal spermmorphology among workers exposed from 0.28 to 1.94 ppm; a threefold increasein the rate of spontaneous abortion among wives of the workers was alsofound. In addition, NIOSH (1977c) cited a study by Davtian et al. (1973),who reported a significant excess of embryonic mortality in female ratsthat were mated to male rats exposed to 1 ppm chloroprene. The investigatorsalso found chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells of exposed malerats. NIOSH (1977c) also cited a number of reports showing chloropreneto be mutagenic in a variety of test systems. NIOSH concluded that it wasprudent to limit exposure to 1 ppm over a 15-minute period, to limit therisk of genetic abnormalities being transmitted to subsequent generations.This limit represents the lowest concentration that can be measured reliablyover a 15-minute period. The 1-ppm (15-minute STEL) value recommended by NIOSH is based on studiesreported in the USSR literature, and it represents an analytical and samplinglimit of detection. The 10-ppm TLV-TWA is based on a 1981 critical reviewof the world literature and the observation that minimal systemic effectsare observed at 38 ppm. OSHA proposes to adopt the 10-ppm TWA as a PELto substantially reduce the systemic effects associated with chloropreneexposure. However, the Agency solicits comments on the significance ofthe Russian studies as their findings relate to risks to employees. Thishealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forchloroprene if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CYCLOHEXYLAMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-91-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>13</T2>N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1109</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for cyclohexylamine. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 10 ppm. Cyclohexylamine is a liquid with a strong, fishy, amine odor.Data concerning the acute toxicity of cyclohexylamine were reported byEastman Kodak in 1958. In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> of a 5-percent solution in water was between 400 and 800 mg/kg;mice fed a diet of the 1-percent aqueous solution or the undiluted aminehad LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 200 and 400 mg/kg. Injection of the 5-percent aqueoussolution in rats produced LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 5 and 25 mg/kg, while mice injected intraperitoneallywith the 1-percent solution had LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 5 and 10 mg/kg. In guinea pigs, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of undiluted cyclohexylamine is reported to be between 1 and5 mL/kg. Edema, necrosis, and eschars were reported as a consequence ofthese dermal exposures. In rabbits, one drop of a 50-percent solution causedcomplete destruction of the eye. Six-hour inhalation exposures at a vaporconcentration of 12,000 ppm caused deaths in rats, but exposure to 1000ppm caused neither toxic effects nor deaths. Legator, Palmer, Green, and Petersen (1969) considered cyclohexylamineto be a potential carcinogen, mutagen, or teratogen on the basis of dose-dependentchromosomal abnormalities observed in rats injected intraperitoneally withcyclohexylamine. Khera and Stolz (1971) noted adverse effects on rat fertility,and Becker and Gibson (1970) reported embryotoxic effects in mice intraperitoneallyinjected with cyclohexylamine. In contrast, Kennedy, Sanders, Weinberg,et al. (1969) reported no effects of exposure to cyclohexylamine on rabbitand rat fertility, reproduction, embryogenesis, or perinatal and postnataldevelopment. In general, there is agreement concerning the moderate-to-severe toxicityof cyclohexylamine and its potential for intense skin irritation and moderateskin sensitization (Sax 1969). The chemical is well known to be pharmacologicallyactive, having sympathomimetic activity (Barger and Dale 1910). However,Lichfield and Swan (1971) report that human dietary levels of 5 g/day for7 to 8 days produced no pharmacologically active levels in the tissues;furthermore, no changes were detected in blood pressure or heart rate,or in the electrocardiograms of exposed subjects. Chronic experimentaltoxicity data are lacking, but Watrous and Shulz (1950) have reported thatexposure to 4 to 10 ppm of cyclohexylamine caused no symptoms of any kindin acutely exposed workmen. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm for cyclohexylamine. TheAgency preliminarily concludes that limiting workplace exposures to thispreviously unregulated substance to the 10-ppm level will protect workersagainst the risk of severe skin and eye irritation, and sensitization thatare potentially associated with exposure to cyclohexylamine. This healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for cyclohexylamine.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CYHEXATIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13121-70-5; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>)<T2>3</T2>SnOH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1112</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for cyhexatin. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 5 mg/m\3\. At room temperature, cyhexatin exists in the form of whitecrystals. Cyhexatin has oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 500, 700, and 654 mg/kg for rabbits, guinea pigs, and chickens,respectively. The intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat is 13 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977). and the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat has been reported to be 190 mg/kg (ACGIH 1974).Skin exposure to a 1- to 2-percent solution in goats and cattle causedmild effects; sheep showed mild effects after application of a 0.5-percentsolution. One of 5 sheep died from multiple skin applications of a 1-percentsuspension (Johnson et al. 1975). The toxicity of cyhexatin is considered to be moderate, although it isgreater than the toxicity of most other organic tin compounds. Long-termfeeding studies in the rat produced no behavioral changes, mortality, tissuechanges, or hematologic or biochemical changes in response to a 2-yearoral dosage at 12 mg/kg per day for 2 years; however, dosed animals weresmaller than controls. After daily doses by gavage of 24 mg/kg per dayfor 2 weeks, rats showed microscopic changes in the liver, kidneys, andadrenal glands at autopsy. Six mg/kg is considered to be the no-effectlevel in rats, and in dogs, the no-effect feeding level is reported tobe 3 mg/kg. Rats fed 4 to 6 mg/kg, and rabbits fed 3 mg/kg, showed no illeffects on indices for fertility, gestation, viability, or lactation (DowChemical Company 1973). No inhalation data on animals are available andthere are no human data. OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m\3\ for cyhexatin. OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ will protect workers against the riskof skin and other irritation associated with exposure to this tin compoundin the absence of a current limit. This health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for cyhexatin.

The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, for this colorless,combustible liquid, which has a faint, amine-like odor. In rats, 2-N-dibutylaminoethanol has a single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 1.7 g/kg and a corresponding intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> of 0.14 g/kg; these values are approximately analogous to theoral and intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2>s for diethanolamine (Hartung and Cornish 1968). The LD<T2>50</T2> for skin absorption in rabbits is 1.68 g/kg (Smyth et al. 1954).In male rats, the lowest 5-week drinking water dose tolerated without weightloss was 0.13 g/kg/day. Rats that ingested a dose of 0.43 g/kg/day showedelevated kidney-to-body-weight ratios but no histologic changes at autopsy(Cornish, Dambrauskas, and Beatty 1969). In inhalation studies of rats,6-hour exposures at 70 ppm for 5 days killed one rat, and the survivingrats showed a 57 percent average body weight loss, as well as a doublingof kidney-to-body-weight ratio, a 10-fold increase in serumbilirubin, aslight increase in clotting time, and an elevated hematocrit. Inhalationof 33 ppm for one week caused a 3-percent body weight loss and a slightincrease in clotting time, but no significant changes in the other variablesobserved. Twenty-seven weeks of exposure to 22 ppm caused no differencesin the variables measured between exposed rats and controls (Cornish, Dambrauskas,and Beatty 1969). 2-N-dibutylaminoethanol is a more potent inhibitor ofacetylcholinesterase in vitro than is diethylamine (DEA) (Hartung and Cornish1968).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, for2-N-dibutylaminoethanol. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limitwill protect exposed workers from the risk of metabolic effects associatedwith inhalation exposure at the levels permitted in the absence of anyOSHA limit. In addition, OSHA concludes that this substance presents arisk of systemic toxicity via percutaneous absorption and that a skin notationis required to substantially reduce this risk. This health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for 2-n-dibutylaminoethanol.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DIGLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2238-07-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1139</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for diglycidyl ether (DGE) is 0.5 ppm as a ceilingconcentration, and the ACGIH recommended TLV is 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.NIOSH recommends a limit of 0.2 ppm as a 15-minute ceiling. Both the previous ACGIH 0.5 ppm TLV and that organization's current TLVare based on the results of an animal study reported by Hine and Rowe (1963)in which rats were administered repeated 4-hour exposures of 20 ppm, 3ppm, or 0.3 ppm DGE. Rats exposed to 20 ppm of DGE showed respiratory irritation,loss of body weight, decreased leukocyte count, involution of the spleenand thymus, and hemorrhagic bone marrow. Residual hematopoietic effectswere observed among rats exposed to 3 ppm, and no observed effects werenoted among rats exposed to 0.3 ppm after as many as 60 exposures. Theprevious TLV of 0.5 ppm as a ceiling value was based on the no-observedeffect level of 0.3 ppm reported in this study and on industrial experience.In 1979, the ACGIH reconsidered its limit for DGE, noting that ``in viewof the seriousness of some of the effects produced [in the rat study],a TLV below the no-ill-effect level [of 0.3 ppm] would normally be adopted''(ACGIH 1986). The ACGIH consequently revised the TLV to 0.1 ppm as a TWA.OSHA preliminarily finds that the revised TWA limit of 0.1 ppm will protectexposed workers against the hematopoietic and irritant effects to whichthey are potentially exposed at OSHA's current PEL. The risks of DGE exposurerange from respiratory irritation to bone marrow effects. The proposedlimit for DGE is intended to reduce this risk substantially. This healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, DSHA will establish a new limit for diglycidylether if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHANOLAMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 141-43-5; Chemical Formula: NH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1159</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 3 ppm for ethanolamine. The ACGIHrecommends the same TWA limit and a 15-minute STEL of 6 ppm. Ethanolamineis a colorless liquid with a mild smell like that of ammonia. The health hazards associated with exposures to ethanolamine include skinirritation and necrosis and central nervous system depression. The oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 3.32 g/kg and the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> in rats as 981 mg/kg (Hartung and Cornish 1968). The dermaltoxicity is considerably higher, with the LD<T2>50</T2> being reported as 1 mg/kg in the rabbit. Dermal applicationof the undiluted liquid also caused redness, swelling, and burns comparableto mild first-degree burns (Union Carbide Corporation, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 235). The eye injury potential of ethanolamine is just slightlyless than that of undiluted ammonia (Carpenter and Smyth 1946). Rats fed0.5 percent in their food for 90 days (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951)showed no adverse effects, but at 1.28 g/kg/day, fatalities occurred. Treonand associates (1975) reported lung, liver, and kidney damage in variousspecies exposed to high concentrations of the vapor and mist. In testsof various species, Weeks and coworkers (1960) reported marked dermal effectsfrom continuous exposures (24 hours/day, 7 days/week for from 24 to 90days) at various concentrations of the vapor; at 12 to 26 ppm, dermal effectswere less severe, but at 5 ppm, skin irritation was still evident. Dogsalso experienced a slight and temporary weight loss after 90-day exposureto 5 ppm, as well as decreased activity and alertness (Weeks, Dowing, Musselmanet al. 1960). Luck and Wilcox (1953) demonstrated that a portion of low-doseethanolamine is not excreted and is presumably retained in the body ofcats, rats, and rabbits. In studies of anesthetized dogs, Priddle (1954) reported that low dosescause central nervous system stimulation, while lethal doses cause CNSdepression. Ethanolamine's irritant and necrotic effect on the skin isnot related to its alkalinity (Hinglais 1948). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 3 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 6 ppm forethanolamine. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of these limitsare required to protect workers against the risk of irritation and neuropathiceffects potentially associated with exposure to the levels permitted inthe absence of a short-term limit. This health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethanolamine if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHYLENE CHLOROHYDRIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-07-3; Chemical Formula: ClCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1167</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm. with a skin notation,for ethylene chlorohydrin. The ACGIH recommends a ceiling limit of 1 ppm,with a skin notation. Ethylene chlorohydrin is a colorless liquid witha faint ethereal odor. The primary health hazards associated with exposure to this substance arecentral nervous system effects, cardiovascular effects, liver damage, kidneydamage, gastrointestinal effects, skin irritation, eye irritation, andmutagenic effects. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 72 mg/kg, and the intra peritoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is 56 mg/kg (Goldblatt and Chiesman 1944). In guinea pigs,the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is 98 mg/kg, and the percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> is 205 mg/kg (Wahlberg and Bowman 1978).The skin absorption rate for ethylene chlorohydrin is high; Semenova andassociates (1978) determined that the LD<T2>50</T2> must be reduced to one-fifth if ethylene chlorohydrin is administereddaily for 20 days (Semenova, Kazanina, Fedyanina et al. 1978). Inhalation toxicity is also high. Ambrose (1950) has reported that a single1-hour exposure at 7.5 ppm and repeated 1-hour exposures at 2 ppm can befatal to rats. Exposures of 15 minutes daily at concentrations of from900 to 1000 ppm were fatal to rats within a few days (Goldblatt and Chiesman1944). In subacute and chronic studies, rats have shown fatalities from a dailydietary dose of 67.5 mg/kg (Oser, Morgareidge, Cox, and Carson 1975). Semenovaand associates (1978) reported a 4-month no-effect inhalation level of0.0033 ppm; at 0.017 ppm, slight CNS inhibition changes in the cavity ofacid phosphatases and urinary secretion of nitrogen were observed after4 months. These investigators also observed increased chromosomal aberrationsin rat bone marrow at the 0.22-ppm level for 4 months (Semenova, Kazanina,Fedyanina et al. 1978). Voost and Vet (1969) tested ethylene chlorohydrin in Klebsiella pneumoniaeand found it strongly mutagenic. This finding was confirmed by the Amestest in Salmonella typhimurium; ethylene chlorohydrin reacts with DNA,since it inhibits the growth of DNA-deficient bacteria (Rosenkranz andWhodkowski 1974). A dose related increase of liver protein and glutathiondepletion was observed in rats after a single dose of ethylene chlorohydrinof from 10 to 50 mg/kg (Friedman, Scalera, Balazs et al. 1977). One fatal and several non-fatal cases of poisoning in industrial workershave been reported from exposure (for unspecified periods) to levels between300 and 500 ppm. Autopsy of the worker who died revealed severe damageto the liver and brain, as well as effects in other organs. The survivorsexperienced nausea, vomiting, and irritation of the eyes, nose, and lungs(Bush, Abrams, and Brown 1949). Dierker and Brown (1944) reported thata 2-hour inhalation exposure to 300 ppm was fatal in one accidental exposure.OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 1 ppm for ethylene chlorohydrin, witha skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willprotect workers against the risk of central nervous system and other systemiceffects associated with workplace exposures at the levels permitted witha TWA limit alone. The skin notation is retained because ethylene chlorohydrinis readily absorbed through the skin. This health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for ethylene chlorohydrin if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">GLYCIDOL (2,3-EPOXY-1-PROPANOL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 556-52-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>O<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1189</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 50 ppm TWA for glycidol. TheACGIH recommends a limit of 25 ppm TWA for this colorless liquid. Glycidol causes eye, respiratory, and pulmonary irritation. Hine and associates(1956) conducted a study of animal toxicity caused by glycidol exposureand reported that glycidol is irritating to the lungs, with mice and ratsexhibiting pneumonitis and emphysema resulting from vapor inhalation. TheLC<T2>50</T2> reported for mice is 450 ppm for a 4-hour exposure; the 8-hourLC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 580 ppm (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956).A single dermal application was only mildly irritating (Draize score, 4.5);repeated daily skin applications were severely irritating after 4 days.One drop of pure glycidol in the rabbit eye caused severe but reversiblecorneal injury (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956). In rats, chronicexposures to 400 ppm (7 hours/day for 50 days) did not cause systemic toxicity,but eye irritation and respiratory distress were observed after the firstfew exposures (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956). A study to determineglycidol's tumorigenic potential on the skin of mice showed negative results(Van Duuren et al. 1967). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 25 ppm TWA for glycidol.

Inhalation studies of hexafluoroacetone in animals have shown varied systemictoxicities, including injury to the liver, kidney, testes, thymus, andbone marrow. In rats and dogs exposed 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeksat concentrations of about 0.1, 1.0, or 12 ppm, no effects (other thanincreased lung weights in dogs) were observed in either species at 0.1ppm. However, the 12-ppm exposures produced severe effects in both species,including marked but reversible testicular damage and slight hypoplasiaof the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Company,Inc. 1971 as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 303). Reversible kidney damage inrats and increased lung weights in dogs occurred during the 1.0-ppm exposures.An earlier 4-hour acute exposure of rats demonstrated that 300 ppm wasa lethal concentration (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 303). In rats, 2-week dermal exposures of 65, 130, or 250 mg/kg resulted in numerousadverse effects, including testicular damage and corresponding changesin lipid metabolism (Kennedy et al. 1982). A dermal dose of 13 mg/kg producedno adverse effects (Lee and Gillies 1984). An injected dose of radiolabeledhexafluoroacetone was. for the most part, rapidly excreted in unmetabolizedform in the urine; this material also did not accumulate in rat testes(Gillies and Rickard 1984). Britelli and co-workers reported that hexafluoroacetonewas fetotoxic in rats (1979). Dermal application of 90 mg/kg/day to pregnantrats resulted in maternal toxicity. Fetal toxicity occurred at maternaldoses of 25 mg/kg, and fetal size was reduced at maternal doses of 5 and25 mg/kg; however, 1 mg/kg produced no fetal effect. Although soft-tissuedamage and external abnormalities were observed, teratogenicity could notbe demonstrated definitively (Britelli et al. 1979). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 ppm TWA and a skin notation forhexafluoroacetone. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits,taken together, will protect hexafluoroacetone-exposed workers from thesystemic injuries that can be manifested at multiple organ sites, reproductiveeffects, kidney damage, and fetotoxic effects associated with exposureto this substance at previously uncontrolled levels. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for hexafluoroacetone.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">HYDROGEN CYANIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-90-8; Chemical Formula: HCN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1207</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for hydrogen cyanide is a 10-ppm TWA, with a skinnotation. The ACGIH recommends a 10-ppm ceiling limit, also with a skinnotation. NIOSH (1976) has recommended that workplace exposures not exceed4.7 ppm as a 10-minute ceiling.The ACGIH summarized the extensive body of human evidence on the adverseeffects resulting from exposure to hydrogen cyanide. They note that exposureto levels of 45 to 54 ppm can be tolerated for 1 hour with no immediateor delayed effects, and that 18 to 36 ppm produces ``slight'' symptomsafter several hours of exposure. They also cite Grabois (1954), who reportedthat workers in apricot kernel processing plants experienced no ill effectswhen exposed to hydrogen cyanide on the order of 10 ppm. The NIOSH recommendation of 4.7 ppm as a 10-minute ceiling limit is basedlargely on an epidemiologic study by El Ghawabi (1976), showing an increasein symptoms of headache, weakness, throat irritation, vomiting, dyspnea,lacrimation, colic, and nervousness among workers exposed for an averageof 7.5 years to cyanide concentrations ranging from 4.2 to 12.4 ppm. NIOSHalso cited other papers reporting similar symptoms among cyanide-exposedworkers. NIOSH acknowledged that such symptoms can be caused by a widevariety of other chemical or physical factors, but believed that thesesymptoms were sufficiently well characterized as being associated withcyanide exposure to warrant their consideration as indicators of healthimpairment. Therefore, NIOSH recommended a 4.7 ppm limit, determined froma 10-minute sample. Because of this recommendation, ACGIH considered recommendinga 3-ppm TLV-ceiling for hydrogen cyanide; however, a majority of committeemembers favored retention of the 10-ppm ceiling limit at ACGIH's 1979 meeting.The 10-ppm (ceiling) TLV is based on the observation of some health effectsat 18 to 36 ppm and no observed effects at 10 ppm. More recent epidemiologicaldata indicate that a variety of symptoms may be associated with exposureto hydrogen cyanide at levels less than 10 ppm. This indicates that neitherthe existing PEL nor the ACGIH TLV may be sufficiently protective. OSHAtherefore proposes a 4.7 ppm (ceiling) as the PEL. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for hydrogen cynanideif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. OSHA's preliminary feasibility analysis is based on limited dataat this exposure level, and the Agency therefore requests additional feasibilityinformation from the public.<ITAG tagnum="26">HYDROGENATED TERPHENYLS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No.: 61788-32-7; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1210</ITAG>OSHA does not currently regulate the hydrogenated terphenyls. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm (approximately 5 mg/m\3\) TWA for thesecomplex mixtures of ortho-, meta-, and para-terphenyls in various stagesof hydrogenation. Acute exposure to the hydrogenated terphenyls poses a risk of potentiallung, eye, and skin damage. Chronic exposure presents a risk of systemictoxicity involving injury to the liver, kidneys, and blood-forming organs,as well as possible metabolic disturbances and cancer (ACGIH 1986, p. 311).Early studies of unhydrogenated terphenyl isomers determined that the LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is low, i.e., 1900 mg/kg for the ortho isomer, 2400mg/kg for the meta isomer, and 10,000 mg/kg for the para isomer (Cornish1962). Thirty-day oral administration of 500 mg/kg/day in the diet of ratsindicated possible liver and kidney damage, which was suggested by increasesin the liver and kidney to body-weight ratios and decreases in the rateof weight gain (Cornish 1962). Other studies have demonstrated nephrotoxicityand liver damage in rats fed 33 mg/kg or more of unirradiated terphenylisomers (Petkau and Hoogstraater 1965; Young et al. 1969). Inhalation studiesshowed that bronchopneumonia is associated with exposure to the ortho andmeta isomers, but not to the para isomer (Haley et al. 1959). Cornish'swork (1962) showed that none of the isomers caused skin irritation in rabbitsfollowing a 24-hour dermal application. For terphenyls that are approximately40 percent hydrogenated, the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 17,500 mg/kg; in mice, it is 12,500mg/kg (Adamson and Weeks 1973). This study also demonstrated that an irradiatedhydrogenated terphenyl mixture is three times more acutely toxic by ingestionthan is a non-irradiated mixture. This finding was confirmed in 16-weekchronic ingestion studies (Adamson and Weeks 1969); these authors foundthat 1200 mg/kg of an irradiated mixture was lethal to mice, while thesame dose in non-irradiated form produced only an irreversible interstitialnephritis. In the same study, no effects were observed for either mixtureat a dose level of 250 mg/kg. Eight-day inhalation studies in mice showed some pathologic changes inlung tissue after 500 mg/m\3\ exposures to non-irradiated hydrogenatedterphenyls; 8-week exposures at 2000 mg/m\3\ resulted in the same lungdamage, as well as some proliferation of the smooth endoplastic reticulumin the liver (Adamson and Weeks 1969, 1973). Carcinogenesis in mice hasbeen reported from 8-week skin exposures to the irradiated mixture (Hendersonand Weeks 1973). The significance of the changes observed by Adamson andFurlong (1974) in the mouse lung after 8 weeks of inhalation exposure tothe irradiated mixture is difficult to interpret in terms of the potentialof the hydrogenated terphenyls to cause pulmonary cancer; particles werefound to clear the lungs rapidly but to accumulate and clear more slowlyin the intestine, kidney, and liver. OSHA is proposing a 0.5-ppm 8-hour TWA for the complex mixtures of ortho-,meta-, and para-terphenyls (either irradiated or non-irradiated) in variousstages of hydrogenation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limitwill protect exposed workers from the risk of eye, skin, and lung damage,and of systemic toxicity to the liver, kidney, and blood-forming organs,potentially associated with exposure at the levels possible in the absenceof any OSHA limit for this substance.

At 300 ppm, Gage reported transient hemoglobin and MCHC decreasesand lung congestion after 15 exposures. Exposure at the 100-ppm level producedno effect (Gage 1970). Another study reported a significant increase inthe osmotic fragility of erythrocytes in female rats after a 4-hour inhalationexposure to 62 ppm, but no effect was observed at 32 ppm (Carpenter etal. 1956). Studies of four species exposed at concentrations of 200, 50,or 25 ppm 6 hours/day for 26 weeks resulted in hematologic changes onlyin rats; increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes was marked at 200ppm, slight at 50 ppm, and minimal at 25 ppm (Moffet, Linnett, and Blair1976).

NIOSH recommends a limit of 50 ppm for IGE as a15-minute ceiling. IGE is a colorless and volatile liquid. The 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for mice was 1500 ppm and the 8-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 1100 ppm (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956).The intragastric LD<T2>50</T2>s in mice and rats were 1.30 and 4.2 g/kg, respectively; inrabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> was 9.65 g/kg (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956). Fiftydaily 7-hour exposures of rats to 400 ppm caused a reduced rate of weightgain, an increase in hemoglobin, a decrease in peritoneal fat, and, insome animals, emphysematous lungs and mottling of the liver (Hine, Kodama,Wellington et al. 1956). Animals in this study also exhibited signs ofocular irritation and respiratory distress. In humans, eye, nose, and upper respiratory irritation occurred in thetechnicians handling the animals in the Hine and co-workers' study; exposurelevels were not specified. Dermatitis has also been reported in workersexposed to other glycidyl ethers during manufacture, and one such caseinvolved IGE exposure (ACGIH 1986, p. 340). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 75 ppmfor IGE.

The ACGIH recommends a limit of 0.02 ppm TWA,with a skin notation; MBOCA is classified as a suspected human carcinogen(A2) by the ACGIH. NIOSH recommends a TWA limit of 3 mg/m3, which is thelowest detectable limit. MBOCA is highly toxic, causing cyanosis, kidney irritation, and methemoglobinemia.It is similar in effect to the other aromatic amines (Hosein and van Roosmalen1978; Mastromatteo 1965.) Steinhoff and Grundman (1969) demonstrated that feeding MBOCA at unspecifiedlevels to rats on a protein-deficient diet caused a high incidence of livercancer. Russfield and associates (1975) reported liver and lung tumorsin rats fed MBOCA while on a standard diet. Dogs fed MBOCA at a dose of100 mg/day, 5 days/week showed no hepatic cancer, but malignant nodulesin the bladder occurred in a dog fed MBOCA for 9 years (Stula et al. 1977).In industry, reversible hematuria has been reported among MBOCA-exposedworkers, but precise concentration data are lacking (Mastrometteo 1965).However, a study of workers exposed for as long as 18 years to MBOCA showedno adverse effects, although the substance and its metabolites were detectedin the urine of these subjects (Linch et al. 1971). Hosein and van Roosmalen(1978) reported an industrial incident where molten MBOCA was splashedin a worker's face; urinary levels of 3.6 mg/L MBOCA, as well as protein,were detected in the urine, and the subject experienced nausea. However,this worker recovered quickly. A recent NIOSH retrospective study involving 370 workers employed in aMBOCA-manufacturing plant evaluated the carcinogenicity of this substance,which is structurally similar to benzidene. The study has found 2 bladdercancers in very young workers (less than 30 years of age), both of whomare non-smokers. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.02 ppm for MBOCA, with a skinnotation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the risk of cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, kidney irritation,and cancer potentially associated with exposures to this substance at thelevels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. A skin notation is proposedto protect against the percutaneous absorption and systemic toxicity demonstratedfor this substance in industrial accidents.

No. 1317</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for phenylhydrazine is 5 ppm TWA, with a skin notation.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm with a STEL of 10 ppm, and a skinnotation. NIOSH (1978a) recommends that workplace exposures not exceed0.14 ppm as measured over a 2-hour period. No data are available on the effects of phenylhydrazine resulting frominhalation. The ACGIH limits are based on the high acute toxicity of thecompound when administered orally or subcutaneously to animals; singledoses on the order of 20 mg/kg have resulted in the death of dogs within22 days (Hease et al. 1935) and produced a marked decrease in erythrocytecount in rodents (von Oettingen and Deichmann 1936). Anemia and hemolysisare the characteristic responses seen in animals fed or injected with phenylhydrazine.In its criteria document on hydrazines, NIOSH (1978a) reviewed four studieson the carcinogenicity of phenylhydrazine in mice. One study (Toth andShimizu 1976) found significant increases in blood vessel tumors. Anotherstudy (Clayson et al. 1966) reported increased incidences of lung adenomasand adenocarcinomas. Two other studies (Roe et al. 1967; Kelly et al. 1969)were negative. NIOSH concluded that phenylhdyrazine should be considereda potential human carcinogen and recommended that exposures not exceed0.14 ppm over a 2-hour sampling period, which represents the lowest levelthat can be detected reliably. The ACGIH (1986) has placed phenylhydrazineon its A2 list. As discussed previously, the NIOSH REL is based on the limitations of theavailable sampling and analytical methods for this substance; this approachdoes not necessarily satisfy OSHA's requirements regarding significantrisk and feasibility. In addition, OSHA is not able to conduct the riskassessment necessary to consider the potential carcinogenic risks associatedwith occupational exposure to phenylhydrazine in time for this rulemaking.The Agency therefore proposes that a 5-ppm (8-hour) TWA and 10-ppm STELbe adopted as an interim PEL to reduce the risk of acute blood-relatedtoxicity that has been associated with phenylhydrazine. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for phenylhydrazineif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.

A 90-day inhalation study conducted by the duPont Company in which ratsand beagle dogs were exposed to average concentrations of 0.6 ppm or 2.2ppm for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, showed that rats exposed to 2.2ppm had significant hematologic changes and testicular degeneration (ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 479). These effects were not noted among rats exposedto 0.6 ppm, but rats exposed at the lower level did show hypersensitivityto sound and touch and mild hyperemia. The dogs tolerated the higher exposurelevel better than the rats in that some regeneration of testicular damageoccurred during a 1-month recovery period. Dogs exposed to 0.6 ppm exhibitedintermittent nausea, diarrhea, lacrimation, and hind leg tremor (ACGIH1986). The ACGIH considered 0.6 ppm to be an NOE level for severe effectsin animals and recommended a 0.05-ppm ceiling TLV to provide a 10-foldsafety margin to protect workers against the changes exhibited by the testanimals at the 0.6 ppm level.OSHA preliminarily concludes that workers currently exposed to uncontrolledlevels of phenylphosphine are at risk of experiencing the nausea, irritation,and CNS effects found to be associated with such exposures in animals.The Agency believes the proposed ceiling of 0.05 ppm will reduce this risksubstantially. This health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for phenylphosphine.

Phosphine is a colorlessgas with a disagreeable, garlic-like odor. Early studies reported that laboratory animals could tolerate phosphinein 4-hour daily exposures of 5 ppm for 2 months, but fatalities were observedfrom seven similar exposures at 10 ppm (Muller 1940). In 1975, Waritz andBrown reported a 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 11 ppm in rats; these lethal exposures caused effects typicalof respiratory irritation. Prior to 1958, numerous cases of phosphine-related occupational poisoningsand deaths were reported including a fatality caused by pulmonary edemathat was attributed to an exposure to 8 ppm for 2 hours daily (Harger andSpolyar 1958). Sublethal symptoms (without chronic effects) occurred atphosphine exposures averaging 10 ppm or less, with excursions of up to35 ppm: recorded symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, respiratorydistress, and dizziness (Jones, Jones, and Longely 1964). The literaturecontains no documented reports of chronic poisoning caused by prolongedexposure to phosphine, although several authorities have asserted thatthis is a possibility (Henderson and Haggard, 1963; Fairhall 1957; Johnstoneand Miller, 1940; Patty 1963; American Industrial Hygiene Association,1964). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL for phosphine of 0.3 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 1 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of these limitsare required to protect exposed workers from the risk of lung damage, diarrhea,nausea, and other effects potentially associated with elevated short-termand long-term exposure to this gas.

Rats inhaling propyl nitrate vapor for 4 hours at a concentration of 10,000ppm demonstrated cyanosis and methemoglobinemia before they died (Hood1953, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 505).

The intravenous LD<T2>50</T2> in unanesthetized rabbits has been reported to be between 200and 250 mg/kg; in anesthetized dogs and cats, intravenous doses of between100 and 200 mg/kg were usually fatal (Murtha, Stabile, and Wills 1956).Murtha and associates, who conducted these studies, concluded that n-propylnitrate exerts a direct action on the vascular smooth muscle and that theensuing cardiac effects and respiratory depression contribute to the compound'shypotensive action (Murtha, Stabile, and Wills 1956). Inhalation trialsin mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, and dogs have established 4-hourLC<T2>50</T2> values ranging from 9000 to 10,000 ppm for rats, 6000 to 7000for mice, and 2000 to 2500 for dogs. Dogs survived repeated exposures (6hours/day, 5 days/week) at 260 ppm for 6 months, although slight clinicalsigns were observed during the first 2 weeks of exposure (Rinehart, Garbers,Greene, and Stoufer 1958). The percutaneous toxicity of n-propyl nitrateis low but may cause inflammation and thickening of the skin after repeatedexposures; these effects are sometimes transient, however (ACGIH 1986,p. 505). The odor of n-propyl nitrate is detectable at 50 ppm. To protectagainst cardiovascular and respiratory depressant effects requires bothTWA and STEL limits. OSHA proposes a limit of 25 ppm TWA with a STEL of 40 ppm for n-propylnitrate.

The ACGIH has established exposure limitsof 0.05 mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA and 0.15-mg/m\3\ TLV-STEL, with a skin notation.Sodium fluoroacetate is a fine white powder, which is sometimes dyed blackfor commercial use. Sodium fluoroacetate causes vomiting, convulsions, and ventricular fibrillation.It is highly toxic by inhalation, ingestion, or via absorption throughthe skin (NIOSH/OSHA, 1981). The ACGIH calculated and set the thresholdlimit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ based on studies of rats indicating an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 1.7 mg/kg (Lehman 1951). Tissue changes in rats were notedin a later study by the same author in which the animals were fed 0.25mg sodium fluoroacetate/kg/day (Lehman 1952); the equivalent level in humanswould be 17 mg/person/day. A further study by Miller and Phillips (1955)examined growth rates in rats fed various dosages of sodium fluoroacetate.Rats who received 10 ppm in their diet experienced a transient fluctuationin growth rate. At 20 ppm (approximately 2 mg/kg in young rats), the growthrate declined markedly the first week; the rats survived and resumed growthat the normal rate in 3 to 4 weeks. Tolerance for the chemical lasted lessthan 2 weeks, and those rats who had adjusted to sodium fluoroacetate showeda second retardation of growth when returned to a dietary level of 20 ppm,after a 2-week interval of eating a normal diet. Miller and Phillips (1955)noted that rats conditioned to a dietary level of 20 ppm were then ableto adjust to a level of 40 ppm (a dose that is greater than the singleLD<T2>50</T2> dose per day).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\ a STEL of 0.15 mg/m\3\,and a skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that the 8-hourand short-term exposure limits will reduce the risk of systemic effectspossible as a result of exposures above the 8-hour TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\.A skin notation is proposed because this substance causes systemic toxicitywhen absorbed dermally.

The currentACGIH TLV for all isomers of trimethylbenzene is 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.NIOSH has no REL for this substance or its isomers. A study by Battig et al. (1957) provides the basis for the proposed limit;this work reports symptoms among 27 workers exposed to a solvent containing30 percent 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and 50 percent 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene.A ``significant number'' of these workers were reported to have experiencedsymptoms of nervousness, tension and anxiety, and asthmatic bronchitis.The peripheral blood of these workers ``showed a tendency to hypochronicanemia'' and somewhat abnormal clotting ability. This group of workershad been occupationally exposed to total hydrocarbon concentrations rangingfrom 10 to 60 ppm for several years. The authors of the study recommendedmaintaining employee exposures below 35 ppm (Battig et al. 1957). OSHA agrees that workers exposed to trimethylbenzene should be protectedby an OSHA limit. OSHA believes that a 25-ppm 8-hour PEL will provide protectionfor trimethylbenzene-exposed workers, and a PEL set at this level is thereforeproposed. This level will reduce the risk of bronchitis and anxiety previouslyreported in exposed workers. This health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for trimethylbenzene.

NIOSH recommends a limitof 5 mg/m\3\ as a 10-hour TWA. Tungsten is a gray, hard metal. Rats fed a diet containing 0.5 percent insoluble tungsten compounds died,and another group of rats fed 0.1 percent of these compounds suffered noticeableweight loss (Kinard and van de Erve 1941). Studies in rats fed tungstenat 2, 5, or 10 percent of their diet showed that females in all dose groupshas a 15-percent reduction in weight gain (Kinard and van der Erve 1943).The intraperitoneal LD<T2>50 </T2>tungsten metal powder of 5 g/kg body weight; survivors showedminor liver and spleen changes at necropsy (Frederick and Bradley 1946).Studies of the tissues of guinea pigs intratracheally injected with tungstenmetal and tungsten carbide revealed moderate interstitial cellular proliferationand no changes, respectively. However, Soviet studies involving similarintratracheal injections showed proliferation of the intra-alveolar septa(Kaplun and Mezentseva 1960). The NIOSH criteria document for tungsten(1977) reports that Russian investigators found a 9- to 11-percent incidenceof pulmonary fibrosis in workers exposed to tungsten (Kaplun and Mezentseva1959; Mezentseva 1967). NIOSH recommended that the standard for the tungstenand its insoluble compounds be set at 5 mg/m\3\ to protect against pulmonaryeffects. To date, studies of industrial conditions have yielded evidencethat pneumoconiosis does not develop from exposure to tungsten metal orits insoluble compounds (Dernehl 1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 614).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ and a STEL of 10 mg/m\3\ fortungsten and its insoluble compounds.

Animal studies have shown that the LD<T2>50 </T2>for soluble sodium tungstate when injected subcutaneously inrats ranges from 140 to 160 mg/kg (Kinard and van de Erve 1940). Solubletungsten's lethal effects are the result of systemic poisoning that occursas the compound is absorbed by multiple organs; this is followed by cellularasphyxiation (International Labour Office [ILO] 1934). Karantassis (1924)also observed a systemic response in guinea pigs given soluble sodium tungstateor pure soluble tungsten either orally or intravenously, developed anorexia,colic, trembling, and difficulty in breathing prior to death. Rats feda diet containing 0.5 percent tungsten as soluble sodium tungstate or tungstenoxide died from this dose. Dietary doses of 0.1 percent tungsten oxideand the sodium salt caused weight loss in rats, but no deaths (Kinard andvan der Erve 1941). Tungsten is believed to act by antagonizing the actionof molybdenum (Higgins, Richert, and Westerfield 1956). NIOSH states inits criteria document for tungsten (1977) that information on the effectsof exposure to soluble tungsten compounds in the working population isunknown. The ACGIH (1986, p. 614) recommends a lower TLV for the solublecompared with the insoluble compounds of tungsten because of the former'sgreater systemic toxicity. OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/m\3\ and a STEL of 3 mg/m\3\ for tungstenand its soluble compounds. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits will protect exposed workers against the risk of systemic toxicity,anorexia, colic, incoordination, trembling, and dyspnea associated withexposure to these compounds, which are presently not regulated by OSHA.This health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor tungsten and compounds (soluble).

NIOSH recommends that employee exposure to VCD be reducedto the lowest feasible level, and considers VCD a carcinogen. Vinylidenechloride is a colorless liquid that polymerizes readily. The acute oral LD<T2>50 </T2>for male rats is 2500 mg/kg (Jenkins, Trabulus, and Murphy1972). The LC<T2>50 </T2>for rats exposed to a single 4-hour exposure of VCD vapor wasreported as 6350 ppm in one study (Siegel, Jones, Coon, and Lyon 1971)and 32,000 ppm in an earlier study (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani 1949).Liquid VCD causes transient irritation to the eyes of rats but has littleeffect on exposed skin if the VCD is allowed to evaporate (Torkelson andRowe 1981). Prendergast and co-workers exposed rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and monkeys8 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 weeks to 395 mg/m\3\ (100 ppm); these authorssaw no visible signs of toxicity while the exposure was in process, butrabbits and monkeys lost weight. These same species were exposed continuouslyto VCD concentrations of 5, 15, 25, or 47 ppm for 90 days; only the animalsexposed to 5 ppm showed no increases in mortality (Prendergast, Jones,Jenkins, and Siegel 1967). Nasal irritation, liver cell degeneration, and retarded weight gain werereported in rats following twenty 6-hour exposures to 500 ppm VCD (Gage1970); at 200 ppm, only nasal irritation occurred. Studies by Torkelsonand Rowe (1981) in which rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs were exposedto 25, 50, or 100 ppm VCD for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week for 6 monthsrevealed injury of the kidneys and liver in all animals at all levels ofexposure. Maltoni (1977) and Maltoni, Cotti, Morisi, and Chieco (1977)conducted an evaluation of VCD's carcinogenicity in which mice, rats andhamsters were exposed to levels from 10 ppm to 150 ppm for 4 hours perday, 5 days per week for 52 weeks, with results reported through week 98of the study. In those mice exposed to 25 ppm VCD, 21 percent of the malesand 1.5 percent of the females developed kidney adenocarcinomas; thesetumors were not seen in rats exposed to amounts of VCD up to 150 ppm. Exposuresof 100 or 150 ppm in rats did produce a significant increase in mammaryadenocarcinomas, and this response was dose-related (Maltoni 1977; Maltoni,Cotti, Morisi, and Chieco 1977). Overt toxicity and mortality occurredearly in the studies after 4-hour exposures at levels of 50 ppm in miceand 200 ppm in rats; hamsters exposed to 20 ppm VCD showed no increasein tumor incidence (Maltoni 1977; Maltoni, Cotti, Morisi, and Chieco 1977).A study by Murray, Nitschke, Rampy, and Schwetz (1979) investigated theembryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic effects of inhaled and ingestedVCD (in rats) and inhaled VCD (in rabbits). In the inhalation studies,rats were exposed to 20, 80, or 160 ppm VCD for 7 hours per day. VCD wastoxic to both the adults and their embryos at levels of 80 and 160 ppmamong the rats, and 160 ppm in rabbits. At exposure levels of 20 ppm inrats and 80 ppm in rabbits, neither maternal toxicity nor effects on embryonicor fetal development were noted. In the ingestion study with rats, drinkingwater containing 200 ppm VCD caused no toxic effects in either the ratsor their offspring. Two strains of rats exposed to 75 or 100 ppm VCD for 5 days/week, 6 hours/dayfor 12 months did not show a significant increase in tumors (Viola andCaputo 1977). Other investigators exposed rats to 25 or 75 ppm by inhalationfor 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 18 months or to 60, 100, or 200 ppm VCDin their drinking water for 2 years and found no increase in tumor incidencein these animals (Rampy, Quast, Humiston et al. 1977). In mice, VCD wasnot active either as a whole mouse skin carcinogen or by subcutaneous injection.In other studies, VCD proved mutagenic in both E. coli and S. typhimuriumstrains (Greim, Bonse, Radwan et al. 1975; Bartsch, Malaveille, Montesano,and Tomatis 1975). VCD has been implicated as a tumor initiator in a carcinogenesisbioassay by Van Duuren (1979). Studies by Reitz, Watanabe, McKenna et al.(1980) suggest that VCD's tumorigenicity is a result of its ability toinitiate cell injury and not of its ability to alter the genetic materialof an injured cell. The actual cell injury is caused by VCD metaboliteswhich are highly reactive and cytotoxic (Maltoni 1977; Hathaway 1977; Henschlerand Bonse 1977). A cohort study of 138 VCD-exposed workers did not identify any VDC-relatedhealth effects in these workers (Ott, Fishbeck, Townsend, and Schneider1976). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 5 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 20 ppmfor vinylidene chloride. The Agency preliminarily concludes that theselimits will protect workers from the risk of kidney and liver damage andcarcinogenicity potentially associated with exposure to VCD at the levelspermitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. This limit may be an interimlimit; as future priorities permit, the Agency may perform a quantitativerisk assessment for VCD and consider further rulemaking. This health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for vinylidene chloride(1,1-dichloroethylene). At the time of the final rule. OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">WELDING FUMES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: Not available </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1430</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limits for exposure to welding fumes, which it definesas fumes that are generated by the manual metal arc or oxy-acetylene weldingof iron, mild steel, or aluminum. The ACGIH has set an 8-hour TWA of 5mg/m\3\ for welding fumes, measured as total particulate inside the weldinghelmet. Although welding of these types generally produces fumes made up of aluminum,iron, or zinc oxides, other toxic gases may be produced in large amounts(Ferry and Ginther 1952; Ferry 1954; Silverman 1956; Homer et al. 1957).Iron metals may give off fumes of manganese, silicate, and various organicbinders. Aluminum welding may result in fumes consisting of fluorine, arsenic,copper, silicon, and beryllium (NIOSH n.d.; American Welding Society 1973).Eighteen different substances, including fluoride, manganese, silicon,titanium, and sodium and potassium silicates, have been measured in thefumes resulting from the welding of mild steel (ACGIH 1986, p. 634). Theprocess of shielded arc welding is known to produce ozone, and when carbondioxide is used as a shield gas, carbon monoxide is given off (NIOSH n.d.;American Welding Society 1973). The adverse health effects associated with over exposure to welding fumesare those of metal fume fever_chills and fever, profuse sweating, and weakness_andrespiratory irritation.OSHA preliminarily concludes that a PEL for welding fumes is needed toprotect workers involved in the welding of aluminum, iron, or mild steelfrom the risk of metal fume fever and respiratory irritation associatedwith welding fumes, and is proposing to adopt a TWA of 5 mg/m3 for weldingfumes as total particulate. This health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for welding fumes. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ZINC OXIDE (FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-13-2; Chemical Formula: ZnO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1437</ITAG>OSHA's existing exposure limit for zinc oxide fume is 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA. The ACGIH also recommends a 5-mg/m3 TWA and also has a STEL of 10mg/m3. NIOSH recommends a 5-mg/m3 10-hour TWA limit with a 15-minute ceilingof 15 mg/m3. When heated. zinc oxide produces a white fume. The most prevalent toxic effect of zinc oxide fume is a condition knownas ``metal fume fever,'' whose symptoms include chills, fever, muscularpain, nausea, and vomiting (Turner and Thompson 1926). Studies in the workplacehave shown that welders exposed to zinc oxide fumes at concentrations of320 to 580 mg/m3 reported nausea, with the development of chills, shortnessof breath, and severe chest pains 2 to 12 hours later. Most workers tookapproximately 4 days to recover, and some eventually developed pneumonia(Hammond 1984). Other studies have reported the frequent occurrence ofchills in workers exposed to zinc oxide at levels as low as 5 mg/m3 (Hickish1963; Wall 1970). Hammond (1984) reported that workers exposed to 8 to12 mg/m3 of zinc oxide fume did not suffer from metal fume fever. Exposure of guinea pigs lasting only an hour caused a drop in body temperature,followed 6 to 18 hours later by an increase above normal levels (Turnerand Thompson 1926). The animals in the high exposure group (2500 mg/m3for 3 to 4 hours) died after exposure. Early studies (Drinker and Fairhall 1957) suggested that metal fume feverwas unlikely to occur at concentrations below 15 mg/m3, but subsequentexperience shows that exposures even at 5 mg/m3 can cause this syndrome(Hickish, private communication, 1963; Wall, private communication, 1970,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 646). NIOSH's Criteria Document (1975) reported that the development of metalfume fever was unlikely at levels as low as 5 mg/m3, but the institutestated that exposures to the fume could cause chronic respiratory effects.OSHA is proposing a 5-mg/m3 TWA and a STEL of 10 mg/m3. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that both of those limits will protect exposed workers from therisk of metal fume fever associated with exposure to zinc oxide fumes atthe elevated short term levels permitted in the absence of a STEL. Thishealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to thislevel. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit forzinc oxide (fume) if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ZIRCONIUM COMPOUNDS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-67-7; Chemical Formula: Zr </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1439 </ITAG>The current OSHA limit for zirconium compounds is an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m\3\.The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\, supplemented by a 10mg/m\3\ STEL. Zirconium compounds may be either bluish-black powders orgrayish-white lustrous metals. The toxic effects of inhalation exposures to zirconium compounds includethe formation of granulomas, both in the lungs and on the skin. Sax (1984)reports cases of pulmonary granulomas in workers exposed to zirconium aerosols.In laboratory animals, oral toxicity is low (NIOSH 1972), and inhalationstudies conducted for one year at levels of 3.5 mg zirconium/m\3\ dustand mist resulted in limited toxicity (Stokinger 1981). OSHA preliminarily concludes that the 5-mg/m\3\ TWA and 10-mg/m\3\ STELlimits for zirconium compounds will protect exposed workers from the riskof pulmonary effects potentially associated with the short-term exposurespermitted by the 8-hour TWA alone. This health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for zirconium compounds if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.Preliminary Conclusions For the group of systemic toxicants shown on Table C8-1, OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that the risks associated with occupational exposures to thesesubstances are substantial. As Table C8-2 shows, the systemic effects causedby such exposures include liver and kidney damage, testicular damage, fetalpoisoning, central nervous system depression, and asthma. Affected employeesmay experience dizziness, nausea, generalized weakness, respiratory irritation,blood in the urine, chest tightness, hives, and necrosis of the cornea.These effects represent risks to health and functional capacity, and reducingthe limits for these systemic toxins will substantially reduce these risks.The health evidence for these substances is a reasonable basis for proposingrevised or new limits for substances in this group. At the time of thefinal rule, OSHA will establish revised or new limits for these systemictoxins if the Agency determines that these limits will substantially reducesignificant risks. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Observed No-EffectsLevels </ITAG>Introduction For a group of 23 toxic substances, OSHA is proposing limits based on evidencethat the levels chosen have been shown not to produce adverse effects inexposed populations. These substances are shown in Table C9-1, along withtheir CAS numbers and H.S. numbers and current OSHA, ACGIH, and NIOSH limits.OSHA is proposing limits for 17 chemicals in this group that have not formerlybeen regulated by the Agency. The Agency is proposing to retain or decreasethe 8-hour limit and to add a STEL in a total of five cases and to reducethe TWA in one instance. NIOSH has RELs only for one substance in thisclass. Description of the Health Effects The substances included in this group cause a wide range of adverse healtheffects in both animals and humans. Unlike most of the other groupingsdescribed in this preamble, these toxicants do not affect the same targetorgan or system: Some are central nervous system depressants, several areupper respiratory tract irritants, and still others have their primaryeffect on the liver and/or kidney.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustrations 2495-497</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>For some compounds in this category, no adverse health effects have beenobserved in animals or humans. This is the case because the research conducteddid not reveal effects at the doses and durations tested. Compounds fallinginto this latter sub-group include 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, diethanolamine,dinitolmide, diuron, oil mist, m-phthalodinitrile, resorcinol, triphenylamine, and the insoluble uranium compounds. The commonality among these otherwise diverse substances is that apparentno-effect levels have been defined for all of them. Permissible exposurelimits have been developed for these chemicals by applying safety factorsto these no-effect levels. Table C9-2 shows the health effects observedin humans and animals after exposure to these substances. Dose-Response Relationships and No-Effect Levels The concept of setting limits based on a NOE level assumes that there isa concentration at which repeated and prolonged exposure to a toxic substancecauses no adverse effect in the majority of workers. A similar conceptis widely used by a variety of federal agencies, for example the Food andDrug Administration, to set contaminant tolerances, acceptable daily intakevalues, and other limits. All of the limits for these substances have been set, with varying degreesof confidence, at a no-effect or minimal effect level, regardless of thespecific effect being protected against. At least in part, the limits proposedfor the 23 items listed in Table C9-1 are based on published or unpublisheddata or information indicating that these limits are already being maintainedin work environments and that industrial experience shows these levelsto be both feasible and free of associated health effects or employee complaints.OSHA believes that these limits will also protect against any effects thesesubstances have been shown to cause at higher concentrations (e.g., minimaleffects are noted in animals at 50 times the TLV-TWAs for trimethylphosphiteand chlorodifluoromethane). The substances in this group have effects thatrange in toxicity from low to high at relatively low exposure concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s100,r58,r150,r150 </C><T4>Table C</T4>9-2._<T4>Health Effects Associated With Substances for Which Limits are Basedon No-Effect Levels </T4><H1>H.S. number chemical name </H1><H1>CAS No. </H1><H1>Health effects observed in animals </H1><H1>Health effects observed in humans</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1029 Atrazine <D>1912-24-9 </D><D/>Ataxia, dyspnea, convulsions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1041 Bromacil <D>314-40-9 </D><D/>Mild irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1056 p-tert-Butyl-toluene <D>98-51-1 </D><D/>CNS depression, respiratory tract irritation, liver and kidney changes<D/>Nasal irritation, nausea, headache, weakness. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1085 Chlorodifluoromethane <D>75-45-6 </D><D/>Cardiac sensitization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1090 o-Chlorotoluene <D>95-49-8 </D><D/>Weakness, vasodilation, incoordination, convulsions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1110 Cyclonite <D>121-82-4 </D><D>  </D><D>Nausea, vomiting, convulsions. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1117 2,6-di-tert-Butyl-p-cresol <D>128-37-0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1134 Diethanolamine <D>111-42-2 </D><D/>Impaired vision skin irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1136 Diethyl phthalate <D>84-66-2 </D><D>  </D><D>Pain, numbness, transient irritation, polyneuritis. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1144 Dinitolmide <D>148-01-6 </D><D/>Liver changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1147 Diphenylamine <D>122-39-4 </D><D/>Liver, kidney, spleen changes <D>Tachycardia, bladder symptoms, hypertension, eczema. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1153 Diuron <D>330-54-1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1249 Methyl acetate <D>79-20-9 </D><D>  </D><D>Eye, mucous membrane irritation, chest tightness. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1275 Metribuzin <D>21087-64-9 </D><D/>CNS depression, thyroid and liver changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1297 Oil mist (mineral) <D>8012-95-1 </D><D/>Lung irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1312 Petroleum distillates (naphtha) <D>8002-05-9 </D><D/>Motor incoordination, convulsions <D>Eye,throat irritation. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1327 m-Phthalodinitrile <D>626-17-5 </D><D/>Skin irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1332 Platinum, metal <D>7440-06-4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1346 Resorcinol <D>108-43-3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1382 Tantalum <D>7440-25-7 </D><D/>Bronchitis, pneumonitis, hyperamia. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1410 Trimethyl phosphite <D>121-45-9 </D><D/>Teratogenicity, ocular irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1415 Triphenyl amine <D>603-34-9 </D><D/>Skin irritation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1418 Uranium (insoluble compounds) <D>7440-61-6 </D><D/>Kidney damage, blood disorders.</ITAG></ITAG>The following discussions describe OSHA's preliminary findings for someof the substances in this group and illustrate the nature of the risk facedby workers exposed to these toxicants.<ITAG tagnum="26">ATRAZINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1912-24-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>14</T2>ClN<T2>5 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1029</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for atrazine. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 5 mg/m.\3\ Atrazine is a stable, white, crystalline compound. Animal studies indicate that the toxicity of the s-triazine herbicides,of which atrazine is the best known, is low. No observable effects havebeen shown in rats, dogs, horses, and cattle fed dietary levels of over25 ppm for extended periods. In addition, the s-triazine herbicides areexcreted in urine and feces in relatively short periods of time (Bakkeet al. 1972). Atrazine has not shown teratogenic effects in studies ofrats, mice, and sheep (the Merck Index 1983; Peters and Cook 1973; Binnsand Johnson 1970). <T3>In vitro </T3>studies have shown no mutagenic effects, and a 2-yearfeeding study in rats and mice showed no carcinogenic effects (Innes etal. 1969). The only reports of toxicity indicate that high-dose ingestionof atrazine can cause ataxia, dyspnea, and convulsions in animals (as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 44). The s-triazines appear to interfere with carbohydratemetabolism by blocking the production of sugars (Gysin 1962; Gast 1958).In humans there are no reports of atrazine poisoning (ACGIH 1986, p. 44).Because there are no reports of human reactions to atrazine that can berelated to air concentrations, the ACGIH's limit was set on the basis ofanimal studies. Long-term feeding studies in dogs have established 3.75mg/kg as the highest no-observed-effect level (U.S. EPA 1979). Applyingappropriate safety factors to this value, and assuming that lung absorptionis less than 50 percent, yields an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m\3\ (Zielhuisand Van der Kreek 1979). OSHA proposes a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA for atrazine and preliminarily concludesthat this limit will protect employees from the risk of metabolic effectsto which they could potentially be exposed in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor atrazine. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a newlimit if the Agency determines that this 1imit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">BROMACIL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 314-40-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>13</T2>BrN<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1041</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for bromacil. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 1 ppm. Bromacil is a white, crystalline solid. Bromacil has a low order of acute and chronic toxicity (Sherman 1975).In 2-year feeding studies of rats, no-effect dietary concentrations weredetermined to be greater than 250 ppm but less than 1250 ppm for rats and1250 ppm for dogs. Rats and rabbits exhibited no teratogenic or carcinogeniceffects as a result of dietary intake (Sherman 1975). Inhalation studiesin rats have shown that all rats tolerate a 4-hour exposure equivalentto 4800 mg/m\3\. Studies of guinea pigs showed no skin sensitization andonly mild irritation after exposures at unspecified levels. Rabbits haveshown no clinical signs of toxicity as a result of the skin applicationof 5000 mg/kg (ACGIH 1986, p. 64). OSHA proposes a permissible exposure limit of 1 ppm for bromacil, and preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect exposed employees against the riskof irritation potentially associated with exposure to bromacil at uncontrolledlevels. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit for bromacil. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">p-tert-BUTYLTOLUENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-51-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>C_C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>CH<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1056</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 10 ppm TWA for p-tert-Butyltoluene. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 20 ppm. p-tert-Butyltolueneis a colorless liquid with an aromatic, gasoline-like odor. p-tert Butyltoluene has been shown to be slightly toxic on ingestion. moderatelytoxic when inhaled, and negligibly toxic through skin exposure (Hine, Unger,Anderson et al. 1954). Repeated exposures in animals have shown liver andkidney changes and microscopic degenerative hemorrhages in the spinal cordand brain, even at relatively low concentrations. The chief acute effectsin animals are central nervous system depression and respiratory irritation;in rats exposed for 1 to 7 hours daily over a 26-week period, 25 ppm dailyappeared to be the no-effect level (Gerarde 1960).In humans, Hine, Unger, Anderson, et al. (1954) observed nasal irritation,nausea, malaise, headache, and weakness associated with exposure to p-tert-butyltolueneat unspecified levels. These authors also observed cardiovascular effects,as well as effects on the central nervous system, the skin, and the respiratorytract. Half of the subjects exposed to p-tert-butyltoluene developed tremorand anxiety, and 25 percent of exposed individuals showed evidence of chemicalcontact irritation of the respiratory tract. OSHA is proposing a TWA of 10 ppm and a STEL of 20 ppm for p-tert-butyltoluene.The Agency preliminarily concludes that a STEL as well as a TWA will protectexposed workers against the risk of central nervous and cardiovascularsystem effects and of irritation and nausea potentially associated withshort-term exposures to p-tert-butyltoluene. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for p-tert-butyltolueneif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLORODIFLUOROMETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-45-6; Chemical Formula: CHClF<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1085</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for chlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22). The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm, with a short-term limit of 1250 ppm for15 minutes. Chlorodifluoromethane is a colorless, nearly odorless, non-flammablegas. Exposure to very high atmospheric levels of Freon 22 cause stimulationand then depression of the central nervous system, followed by asphyxiation.Rats and guinea pigs exposed to concentrations of 75,000 to 100,000 ppmover a 2-hour period exhibited excitation and disequilibrium; narcosiswas observed at 200,000 ppm and mortality at 300,000 and 400,000 ppm (Weigand1971). In mice, similar exposures at 320,000 ppm were the maximum tolerated,and the minimum lethal dose was 370,000 ppm (Karpov 1965). In rabbits,the minimum concentration altering reflex responses was 11,000 to 20,000ppm (Karpov 1965). Studies of guinea pigs reported no fatalities as a resultof exposure for 2 hours at 200,000 ppm, but mild clinical changes wereobserved at 50,000 ppm and minimal effects at 25,000 ppm (Underwriters'Laboratories, Inc. 1940). Thirty-minute exposures at 500,000 ppm were lethalto guinea pigs (Booth and Bixby 1932). Karpov has also reported the resultsof a 10-month study of inhalation effects in rats, guinea pigs, dogs, andcats. Six-hour inhalation exposures to 14,000 ppm and 2000 ppm for 5 days/weekwere studied, and alterations in weight, endurance, blood chemistry, andpathology of the lungs, central nervous system, heart, liver, kidney, andspleen were seen at the 14,000-ppm level in rats, mice, and rabbits. Atthe 2000-ppm daily inhalation level, rats and mice showed no effects. Indogs, cardiac sensitization was not observed at the 25,000-ppm level, butit did occur at the 50,000-ppm level (Reinhardt, Azar, and Maxfield 1971).No data have been published concerning the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity,or teratogenicity of this substance. The Agency is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1000 ppm for chlorodifluoromethaneand a 1250-ppm 15-minute STEL. OSHA preliminarily concludes that theselimits will provide protection against the life-threatening asphyxianteffects that could occur in the absence of any OSHA limit.

No. 1090</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for o-chlorotoluene. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 50 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 75 ppm for this colorless liquid. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats for o-chlorotoluene is greater than 1600 mg/kg. Whenthe undiluted material was administered orally in doses ranging from 50to 100 mg/kg, the animals experienced weakness and vasodilation at thehigher dose levels, but all survived and were gaining weight 2 weeks later(ACGIH 1986 p. 137). When the undiluted liquid was applied to the skinof guinea pigs in doses of 1 cc or 10 cc/kg for 24 hours, moderately severeskin irritation occurred at both dose levels. The guinea pigs lost weightover the 2-week period following application, indicating percutaneous absorptionof this substance. One drop of undiluted material in the eyes of rabbitsproduced a delayed erythema of the conjunctiva, although this effect clearedafter 14 days (Ely, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 137). Rats exposed to anatmosphere of 21 mg/L, or about 4000 ppm, for 6 hours exhibited loss ofcoordination within 1.5 hours, prostration at 1.75 hours, and tremors at2 hours. At 14,000 ppm, rats showed loss of coordination, vasodilation,labored respiration, narcosis, and tearing. Rats exposed at 4000 and 14,000ppm survived. At 175,000 ppm, one of three rats died (Ely, as cited inACGIH 1986 p. 137). In another study, mice, rats, and guinea pigs wereexposed to o-chlorotoluene at a concentration of about 4400 ppm. Mice showedgasping and convulsions within 30 minutes, and guinea pigs and rats exhibitedgasping, hyperpnea, ataxia, and convulsions in 45 minutes. All animalswere comatose within 60 minutes, and, except for two guinea pigs that stillsurvived at 14 days, all of the animals died (Hazleton Laboratories, Inc.1966). In rabbits, the 24-hour patch test resulted in moderate skin irritation;albino rabbits displayed conjunctival irritation from a single instillationof 0.1 ml of undiluted o-chlorotoluene, but no corneal damage was observed7 days later (Hazleton Laboratories, Inc. 1966). Data concerning human exposures are lacking, but no cases of dermatitisor poisoning have been reported as a result of occupational exposure. Personalcommunications from several occupational health experts recommend limitsranging from 25 ppm to 200 ppm TWA for human exposures (Hopton; Mastromatteo;Elkins; Torkelson, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 137). These limits were recommendedon the basis of analogy with similar compounds, such as the chlorinatedbenzenes. OSHA is proposing 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA PEL. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect against the risk of eye and skinirritation and systemic poisoning possible in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor o-chlorotoluene. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CYCLONITE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-82-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>N<T2>6</T2>O<T2>6</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1110</ITAG>OSHA currently has no permissible exposure limit for cyclonite. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 1.5 mg/m\3\ and a STEL of 3 mg/m\3\, with a skinnotation. Cyclonite exists in the form of orthorhombic crystals. Cyclonite, a high exp1osive and a rat poison, has not been shown in animalstudies to be acutely toxic. In industry, reports of poisonings as a resultof occupational exposures to cyclonite were widespread as late as 1962(Kaplan, Berghout, and Peczenik 1962). Exposure causes central nervoussystem effects, including nausea, vomiting, convulsions, and unconsciousness.These clinical signs result from repeated gastrointestinal and respiratoryexposures and from skin absorption (Sunderman et al. 1944; von Oettingen,Donahue, Yagoda et al. 1949). In an epidemiological study, Hathaway (1977)reported that 8-hour TWA exposures ranging up to 1.57 and averaging 0.28mg/m\3\ caused no identifiable abnormalities attributable to cycloniteexposure. OSHA is proposing a limit of 1.5 mg/m\3\ TWA, a 3-mg/m\3\ 15-minute STEL,and a skin notation for cyclonite. The Agency preliminarily concludes thatestablishing these limits for this previously unregulated chemical willprotect workers from the risk of neuropathic effects associated with cycloniteexposure, either as a result of inhalation or percutaneous exposures, inthe absence of an OSHA PEL.

DBPD is considered to have a low order of toxicity; in extensive animalstudies, ingestion has not been associated with toxic effects (ACGIH 1986,p. 227). Deichmann and associates (1955) reported oral LD<T2>50</T2> values of 10.7 g/kg for guinea pigs, 1.7 and 1.97 g/kg formale and female rats, respectively, and ranges of between 0.94 and 2.1g/kg for cats and between 2.1 and 3.2 g/kg for rabbits. One year of dailyoral administration of 0.17 to 0.9 g/kg in dogs produced no effects, nordid a 24-month oral administration of 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 percent DBPD inrats (Deichmann et al. 1955).

By most routes of administration, this substance haslow acute toxicity in laboratory animals and borders on the ``relativelyharmless'' classification according to the systematic grouping developedby Hine and Jacobson (1954). Oral LD<T2>50 </T2>values in the rat range between 9.5 and 31 g/kg (Shibko andBlumenthal 1973); the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50 </T2>for the rat is 5.08 ml/kg (Singh, Lawrence, and Autrian 1972)and, for the mouse, 2.8 g/kg (Calley, Autrian, and Guess 1966). Chronicfeeding studies lasting 6 or more weeks resulted in no-effect levels of2.5 g/kg/day for the rat and 1.25 g/kg/day for the dog, with no specificlesion attributable to diethyl phthalate and no unusual incidence of tumors(Shibko and Blumenthal 1973). A study of workers exposed to a mixture of diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,and di-2-ethyl hexyl phthalate vapors in air at concentrations of 8 to53 mg/m\3\ resulted in findings of no phthalates in the blood (before orafter the exposure) and no peripheral polyneuritis (Raleigh, as cited inACGIH 1986, p. 200). Fassett (1963) reported transient nasal and throatirritation produced by exposure to the heated vapors of diethyl phthalate,but no cumulative effects have been noted. A Russian study of workers (employedfor between 0.5 and 19 years) who were exposed to several phthalate plasticizers(e.g., butyl phthalate, the higher aryl phthalates, dioctyl phthalate,and benzyl butyl phthalate), as well as to sebacates, adipates, and tri-o-cresylphosphate, at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 66 mg/m\3\ resulted insubjective complaints of pain, numbness, and spasms in the upper and lowerextremities. These complaints were related to the duration of exposureand usually began after the 6th or 7th year of employment (Milkov et al.1969). These investigators reported polyneuritis in 32 percent of the 47persons examined for this health effect; of 81 persons evaluated for disturbanceof the vestibular function, 78 percent showed depression of vestibularreceptors (Milkov et al. 1969).

Acute oral toxicity data for diphenylamine are limited. A single reportdescribes a study in which a dietary dose of 1,500 mg/kg killed two oftwenty rats within 30 days of ingestion (Griswold et al. 1966). This suggeststhat diphenylamine is significantly less toxic than aniline (Hamblin 1963).Dietary studies of rats fed 0.025, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 percent diphenylaminefor 226 days demonstrated non-malignant renal cysts at the three highestdoses (Thomas et al. 1957). However, rats given diphenylamine crystalsencapsulated in collodion developed bladder papillomas within 125 days(Yoshida et al. 1941). Exposure to diphenylamine dust has been linked toliver, spleen, and kidney changes in experimental animals (Robert et al.1937).

Methyl acetate is a highly volatile, colorless liquidwith a pleasant odor. Methyl acetate is mildly narcotic and is a known irritant to the mucousmembranes of the eyes and respiratory passages. Occupational exposure tothis substance by vapor inhalation at unreported levels resulted in inflammationof the eyes, nervous irritation, and tightness in the chest (Duquenoisand Revel 1934; Fairhall 1957). Duquenois and Revel (1934) suggested that,like methyl alcohol, methyl acetate may produce atrophy of the optic nerve.Other researchers have suggested that the methanol formed by hydrolysisin the body may be responsible for the toxicity of methyl acetate and,on this basis, have recommended a limit of 250 ppm in the occupationalsetting (Henderson and Haggard 1943). However, Lehmann and Flury (1943)have attributed toxic effects (e.g., blood changes, weight loss, lung irritation),as well as some deaths, to chronic exposures at 6600 ppm. These healtheffects require a PEL which will protect workers against both chronic andacute exposures. No cases of irritation or systemic injury have been reported from industrialexposures to methyl acetate below 200 ppm. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour PEL of 200 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of250 ppm for methyl acetate.

The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 400 ppm, and NIOSH recommends a TWA of87 ppm and a ceiling (15 min) of 450 ppm for these substances. A 1975 study performed by Carpenter et al. exposed rats to between 2800and 24,200 ppm of naphtha. Motor incoordination occurred at 5300 ppm, andconvulsions and death occurred in all animals at 24,200 ppm. Animals exposedto 480 ppm for 63 days showed no signs of toxicity (Carpenter et al. 1975).NIOSH (1977i) noted that rubber solvent (naphtha) is composed primarilyof C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes and, as such, the limit of 350 mg/m\3\ (85 ppm) recommendedfor C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes should apply to naphtha. This recommendation presumesthat all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes possess neuropathic capability; as discussed above inthe section on narcotic agents, OSHA has preliminarily concluded that notall C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are neuropathic agents. In establishing its recommended 400-ppm TLV-TWA for petroleum distillates,the ACGIH relied on the observations that slight irritation occurs in humansat exposure to 430 ppm and that no signs of toxicity occur in animals exposedto 480 ppm. The NIOSH-recommended 85-ppm limit is based on the assumptionthat all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes possess equivalent neuropathic properties. OSHA hastentatively rejected this hypothesis and proposes therefore to reduce thePEL to 400 ppm TWA in order to avoid the risk of extensive irritation.The Agency requests comments on the issue of equivalent toxicity for allC<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes.

Female rabbits exposed at the highest dose lostbody weight (Owen 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 488). A 15-year review of industrial experience revealed no reports of adverseeffects from exposure to m-phthalodinitrile (Zeller, Hofmann, Thiess, andHey 1963). Williams (1959) attributes this absence of exposure effectsto the fact that the aromatic nitriles, of which m-pthalodinitrile is one,do not liberate cyanide in the body, as is the case with the aliphaticnitriles.OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit for m-phthalodinitrile of 5 mg/m\3\.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers from the risk of skin irritation that exists in the absence ofany OSHA limit.

Additionally, this particularstudy demonstrated transient bronchitis, interstitial pneumonitis, andhyperemia at the 100-mg exposure level. Tantalum oxide has been used asa dressing for burns (Olsen 1944), and the use of tantalum gauze in surgicalrepair showed no long-term adverse effects (Dales and Kyle 1958). No adversehealth effects have been associated with industrial exposures to tantalumor its compounds (Cochran, Doull, Mazur, and DuBois 1950). A single oraldose of 6500 mg/kg oxide was virtually nontoxic to rats (ACGIH 1986, p.554). The ACGIH (1986, p. 554) believes that tantalum dust and oxide should beclassified as an inert or nuisance dust and, accordingly, placed tantalumon its 1987-88 Notice of Intended Changes list with a recommendation forincreasing the TLV-TWA to 10 mg/m\3\, the ACGIH's limit for all nuisancedusts, and deleting the current STEL of 10 mg/m\3\.

At exposures of 600 ppm 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for4 weeks, 70 percent of the rats died, and 10 percent of those exposed evenat 300 ppm on the same regimen died (Mobil Oil Corporation 1979). Rats exposed at 100 ppm showed signs of eye irritation, and at 300 to 600ppm, mild to severe cataracts developed. At doses of 164 mg/kg, trimethylphosphite caused gross abnormalities in the offspring of treated rats (MobilOil Corporation 1979). Skin contact with trimethyl phosphite produced severe skin irritation inrabbits, and instillation in the eyes of rabbits caused temporary swellingand irritation but no permanent effects (Fassett 1963). In a group of 179 workers exposed to average concentrations of trimethylphosphite of between 0.3 and 4 ppm, no ocular changes were observed (MobilChemical Corporation 1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 609). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA for trimethyl phosphite of 2 ppm. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposed workers againstthe risk of eye damage, skin irritation, and upper respiratory tract irritationpotentially associated with exposures to this substance at the levels permittedin the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for trimethyl phosphite. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">TRIPHENYL AMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 603-34-9; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>3</T2>N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

No. 1418</ITAG>OSHA's existing PEL for insoluble uranium compounds is 0.25 mg/m3; theACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.2 mg/m\3\ and a 0.6-mg/m\3\ STEL. Uranium is asilver-white radioactive metal. OSHA's existing limit for the insoluble compounds of uranium was basedon several early studies of uranium's toxic effects in animals; these effectsincluded kidney damage and blood changes (Voegtlin and Hodge 1953). Inthe intervening years, a considerable body of evidence has accumulatedbased on the actual occupational exposures of uranium plant workers overa period as long as 25 years. This evidence shows that, before 1950, workerswere often exposed to uranium levels between 0.2 and 1.5 mg/m\3\, but thatafter 1950, only about 6 percent were exposed at 0.05 mg/m\3\ or above;despite these relatively high early exposures, the incidence of all diseases,whether or not linked to radiation exposure, has been no higher than isthe case for workers in the general population (ACGIH 1986, p. 617). However,there is also evidence that several workers were exposed to brief excursionsduring which exposure levels reached a concentration as much as five timesthe TLV (Wing, Heatherton, and Quigley 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p.617). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.2 mg/m\3\ and a STEL of 0.6 mg/m\3\for the insoluble forms of uranium. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat these limits are required to protect uranium plant workers from therisk of kidney or blood disorders potentially associated with both full-shiftand excursion exposures to these compounds. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for uranium if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.Preliminary Conclusions For the group of substances shown in Table C9-1, OSHA preliminarily concludesthat workplace exposures to these substances cause a broad range of adversehealth consequences in exposed individuals; effects include CNS depression,respiratory irritation, liver and kidney damage, cardiac sensitization,and hepatocellular cancer. OSHA believes that the health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing new or revised limits for these substances.At the time of the final rule, the Agency will establish new or revisedlimits if it determines that significant risk will be substantially reducedthereby.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofAdverse Nuisance Effects </ITAG>Introduction OSHA is proposing limits for a group of substances that cause a varietyof adverse effects. These substances are recognized universally as posinga substantial threat to the health, safety, and well-being of workers exposedto them. The term ``nuisance'' for these particulates can be misleadingbecause the hazards they pose in the workplace are real and often serious.The ACGIH classifies many of these substances as nuisance particulatesand applies a single workplace limit to them. OSHA has no substance-specificlimits for these dusts; the Agency's limit for the category of nuisancedusts as a whole is 15 mg/m\3\ as total dust and 5 mg/m\3\ as respirabledust (see Table Z-3 of 29 CFR 1910.1000). Table C10-1 shows the 47 substancesincluded in this group. NIOSH does not recommend a limit for the categoryof nuisance dusts but does have a REL for malathion and fibrous glass dust,two substances included in this group by the ACGIH. For all of these substancesexcept fibrous glass dust, OSHA is proposing to establish an 8-hour TWAlimit of 10 mg/m\3\ as total dust. For fibrous glass dust, the Agency isproposing a limit of 5 mg/m\3\ as a TWA. Description of the Health Effects The adverse effects caused by exposure to these substances include: Interferencewith vision; deposition of these substances in the eyes, ears, nasal passages,and upper respiratory tract; and skin irritation. Thus, workers exposedto excessive concentrations of these substances may have difficulty seeingor be subjected to attacks of uncontrolled coughing and sneezing. Moreover,workers may injure their skin and mucous membranes when they attempt toremove these substances, which settle everywhere. These undesirable exposureeffects also have serious safety implications, because they lead to workplaceaccidents and injuries.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M005 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2530-534</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>When exposures to the substances shown in Table C10-1 are kept under propercontrol in the workplace, exposures are not likely to result in significantorganic disease or irreversible toxic effects. However, it is inappropriateto consider these nuisance particulates biologically inert, because, ifinhaled in sufficient amount, these dusts do cause pulmonary responses.The lung-tissue reactions associated with exposure to these nuisance particulatesleave the structure of the air spaces intact and do not cause scar tissueformation to any significant extent (ACGIH 1986). In addition, the reactionscaused by inhalation are reversible if exposure is stopped. Controllingoccupational exposures to these nuisance particulates and the other substancesincluded in this category to levels below 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA willprevent these adverse effects. Workers protected by the proposed 10 mg/m\3\limit will therefore not be at risk of the seriously distracting and oftenpainful effects associated with exposures above this NOE level. The following discussions describe OSHA's preliminary findings for theparticulates included in this group. In addition, the health effects potentiallyassociated with exposures to these substances are reviewed.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALPHA-ALUMINA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1344-28-1; Chemical Formula: Al<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1014</ITAG>OSHA presently has no specific limit for alpha-alumina, although OSHA'sgeneral nuisance dust limit of 15 mg/m\3\ applies. The ACGIH recommendsan 8-hour TWA of 10 mg/m\3\, measured as total dust. Alpha-alumina, alsocalled aluminum oxide, is a white powder that is widely used as an abrasivegrinding material. A study by Miller and Sayers (1941) determined that alumina particles withdiameters less than 40 microns produced no reaction in laboratory animals.The results of a study by Stacy, King, Harrison et al. (1959) confirmedthe findings of Miller and Sayers; these authors found a-alumina to benearly inert when injected in the lungs of rats (Stacy, King, Harrisonet al. 1959). Inhalation of fine aluminum powders at unspecified levelsdid not cause fibrosis in rats, guinea pigs, or hamsters (Gross et al.1973). In 1923, shortly after a-alumina replaced sandstone as the industrial abrasiveof choice. Macklin and Middleton (1923) reported that workers exposed toaluminum oxide dust using the new, synthetic abrasive had much less pulmonarydisease than workers using sandstone abrasives. Other studies (Sutherland,Meiklejohn, and Price 1937; Meiklejohn and Posner 1947; Meiklejohn andPosner 1948) reported that workers exposed to aluminum oxide dust in thechinaware industry and in aluminum production showed no evidence of pneumoconiosis.However, some early studies (Clark and Simmons 1925; Clark 1929) reportedthat workers engaged in aluminum oxide production and exposed to dust levelsgenerally between 50 and 100 mppcf showed X-ray evidence of pulmonary fibrosis;these workers are likely also to have been exposed to silica. Workers exposedduring World War II to bauxite fumes containing both alumina and silicadeveloped pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema; the authors believe that silicafume was involved in the development of these diseases (Shaver and Riddell1947). The ACGIH (1986, p. 21) states that alpha-alumina acts as an inertmaterial. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for alpha-alumina, thelimit being proposed for all inert particulates. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect workers from the safety and healthrisks potentially associated with exposures to inert particulates in theworkplace. These risks include safety accidents, skin and eye irritation,interference with vision, and distraction from the task at hand. This healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for alpha-alumina.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALUMINUM METAL DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: Al </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1016</ITAG>OSHA currently has no specific permissible exposure limit for aluminummetal dust; however, OSHA's current nuisance dust limit of 15 mg/m\3\ TWAapplies. The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ as totaldust. Aluminum metal dust has been shown to present a minimal health hazard,according to results from the McIntyre Foundation's 27-year study of aluminumoxide dust. No deleterious lung or systemic effects were observed as aresult of exposure to aluminum metal dust having a particle size of 1.2um at calculated concentrations equivalent to 2 mg/m\3\ over an 8-hourworkshift. Even much higher concentrations (not further specified) over10- or 20-minute periods produced no adverse effects (ACGIH 1986, p. 22).Therefore, OSHA has preliminarily concluded that aluminum metal dusts areessentially inert and is proposing a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA, the standardbeing proposed for all nuisance dusts. This level will provide protectionagainst the physical irritation possible at the previously uncontrolledlevel and prevent the safety hazards potentially associated with overexposureto dusts. This health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing anew limit for aluminum metal dust. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limit willsubstantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">AMMONIUM SULFAMATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7773-06-0; Chemical Formula: NH<T2>4</T2>SO<T2>3</T2>NH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1024</ITAG>OSHA currently regulates ammonium sulfamate under its general nuisancedust limit of 15 mg/m\3\. The ACGIH recommends a limit of 10 mg/m\3\ asan 8-hour TWA. Ammonium sulfamate is a colorless, non-combustible, whitecrystalline substance. Ammonium sulfamate has a low order of toxicity and should be considereda nuisance dust. Lehman (1951) found oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 3900 mg/kg, 5700 mg/kg, and 3000 mg/kg in rats, mice, andquail, respectively. He also reported that no effects were noted in ratsadministered 10,000 ppm in the diet for 105 days. The hazards associatedwith exposure to ammonium sulfamate include eye and nose irritation, interferencewith vision, and the danger of accidents caused by the distraction andavoidance reactions typical of workers overexposed to dusts in the workplace.OSHA proposes a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for ammonium sulfamate, which isthe limit being proposed for all workplace dusts with a low order of toxicity.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this revised limit will protectworkers against physical and other irritation and against workplace accidentsassociated with exposure to this substance. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a new limit for ammonium sulfamate.

No. 1031</ITAG>OSHA has no specific limit for barium sulfate, although OSHA's nuisancedust limit applies; the ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\, totaldust, for this substance. Barium sulfate is a white or yellowish, odorless,tasteless powder. Because barium sulfate is insoluble, it is considered an inert dust. Einbrodtet al. (1972) exposed rats to a concentration of 40 mg/m\3\ for 2 monthsand concluded that barium sulfate is an inert dust. As an inert dust ofthe non-collagenous type; however, barium sulfate has the potential tocause pneumoconiosis through tissue reaction to accumulated dust in thelung (Anon., <T3>Brit. Med. J. </T3>1972). Barium sulfate has been observed to causeno adverse effects in industrial workers exposed over periods of severalyears (Doig 1976).OSHA proposes that a PEL for barium sulfate be established at the 10 mg/m\3\TWA level; this limit is the limit proposed by OSHA for all inert dusts.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the hazards associated with exposures to these dusts, which includesafety hazards, eye irritation, and upper respiratory tract irritation.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor barium sulfate.

No. 1032</ITAG>OSHA currently regulates benomyl under its general nuisance dust limitof 15 mg/m\3\. The ACGIH has established a TLV TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for thissubstance. Benomyl is a white crystalline solid, and exposures to it occurin its particulate form. Studies of rats and rabbits indicate that the oral and skin absorptionLD<T2>50</T2>s are greater than 10,000 mg/kg, and studies of guinea pigsshow a very low risk of skin irritation. Application to the shaved intactskin of ten male guinea pigs (as aqueous suspensions containing 5, 12.5,and 25 percent benomyl) resulted in negligible irritation; one of ten guineapigs had mild erythema 2 days after application at the high rate (E. I.du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. 1974). In another study, instillationof 10 mg of dry 50-percent powder or 0.1 ml of 10-percent suspension inmineral oil caused only temporary mild conjunctival irritation (E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. unpublished). No teratogenic or mutageniceffects have been observed in rats, and dogs have been shown to eliminatemore than 99 percent of ingested benomyl within 72 hours (Gardiner, Kirkland,and Klopping 1974). OSHA proposes a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ for this substance as an 8-hour TWA.The Agency believes that this limit will protect workers from the risksof benomyl's effects, which include irritation and erythema. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for benomyl.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">BISMUTH TELLURIDE (UNDOPED) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1304-82-1; Chemical Formula: Bi<T2>2</T2>Te<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for the undoped substance. Bismuth telluride appearsas gray, hexagonal platelets; it is also available as ingots or singlecrystals. An 11-month inhalation study of dogs, rabbits, and rats exposed to purebismuth telluride dust at 15 mg/m\3\ showed the pulmonary responses typicalof exposure to inert dust (Wagner, Madden, Zimber et al. 1974). Thus, OSHA proposes a permissible exposure limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA forpure undoped bismuth telluride. This limit is the same as the limit proposedfor all nuisance dusts. The Agency believes that a 10-mg/m\3\ PEL willprotect workers from the hazards associated with workplace dust exposures,which include skin and eye irritation and safety accidents. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for undopedbismuth telluride.

No. 1039</ITAG>OSHA currently regulates boron oxide under its general nuisance dust limitof 15 mg/m\3\, and the ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\. Boronoxide occurs as a white powder or granular solid, and it has a bitter taste.Animal studies indicate that skin and eye irritation were caused by thetopical application of boron oxide to the skin of rabbits and by ocularinstillation. Studies of aerosol administration at various exposure levelsfor varying time periods caused mild nasal irritation and an increase inurine acidity and creatinine coefficient in dogs and rats (Wilding, Smith,Yevich et al. 1959). Young rats that were force-fed a 10-percent slurryof boron oxide in water for 3 weeks showed no growth retardation or othereffects (Wilding, Smith, Yevich et al. 1959). Gabrant and co-workers (1984) determined the prevalence of eye and respiratoryirritation among boron-oxide-exposed workers; those exposed to boron oxideconcentrations ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 mg/m\3\ were then compared withcontrols. Workers exposed at an average concentration of 4.1 mg/m\3\ reportedsignificant increases in coughing; eye, nose, and throat irritation; drynessof the mouth; and sore throats. The ACGIH believes that a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ will provide protectionagainst boron oxide's irritant effects (ACGIH 1986). However, OSHA notesthat irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes occurs among occupationallyexposed workers at an average airborne concentration of 4.1 mg/m\3\. OSHAtherefore proposes a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA and solicits additional informationon the boron oxide exposure levels associated with adverse health effectsin workers. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for boron oxide. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CALCIUM CARBONATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1317-65-3; Chemical Formula: CaCO<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Calciumcarbonate is an odorless, tasteless powder or crystal. The ACGIH considers calcium carbonate a nuisance dust and has accordinglyestablished a 10-mg/m\3\ TWA limit for it. Beal, Griffith, and Nagelschmidt(as cited in the ACGIH 1986, p. 90) believe that exposure to this substancein its pure form does not cause pneumoconiosis, and Hunter (1975) confirmsthis finding.OSHA is proposing to reduce its current PEL of 15 mg/m\3\ for calcium carbonateto 10 mg/m\3\ to protect workers against the risks associated with dustexposures in the workplace. These risks include eye and skin irritation,as well as the danger of accidents caused by interference with vision andthe distractive effects of these substances. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for calcium carbonate. Atthe time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CALCIUM SILICATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1344-95-2; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH also classifies calcium silicate asa nuisance dust and has established an 8-hour limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for thiswhite powder. There are no reported health effects in humans or animals as a result ofexposure to calcium silicate. Calcium silicate is thus a nuisance dust,without long-term adverse health effects if exposures are kept under reasonablecontrol. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for calcium silicate;this limit is being proposed for all nuisance dusts and inert particulates.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the risk of reduced visibility and distraction that can cause accidentsin the workplace and will also prevent them from experiencing the eye andskin irritation associated with exposures to higher levels of this or othernuisance dusts.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ totaldust for this crystalline or powdery substance. Calcium sulfate dust is known to have a low order of toxicity, and it isnot reported to have specific irritant properties (ACGIH 1986, p. 93).One report has indicated that no lung diseases are associated with exposureto calcium sulfate in miners (Hunter 1975). Because calcium sulfate appearsto be biologically inert, it is appropriately classified as a nuisancedust. OSHA is proposing to reduce the permissible exposure limit to an 8-hourTWA of 10 mg/m\3\ (total dust) for calcium sulfate, the limit being proposedfor all dusts in this category. The Agency preliminarily concludes thatthis limit will prevent eye and skin irritation, interference with vision,and lack of concentration associated with high dust exposures in the workplace.As is the case for all of the substances classified as nuisance dusts,calcium sulfate presents a safety as well as a health hazard to exposedworkers.

No. 1076</ITAG>OSHA currently regulates cellulose under the 8-hour TWA limit of 15 mg/m\3\for nuisance dusts. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ (totaldust). Technical cellulose refers to that portion of the plant cell wallderived exclusively from glucose and resembles cotton cellulose in itsphysical and chemical properties (ACGIH 1986, p. 113). Technical cellulose is inert, and inhalation of cellulose dust is not irritatingor toxic in exposed humans (Schreiber 1974). In industry, cellulose dustoccurs in combination with other substances, such as quartz dust, wood,cotton, flax, jute, and hemp fibers, and these substances have demonstratedtoxicities that are unrelated to their cellulose content (ACGIH 1986, p.113). OSHA is proposing to reduce the PEL for this dust to 10 mg/m\3\ TWA totaldust for cellulose dust containing less than 1 percent quartz. This limitis the limit OSHA is proposing for all of the ``nuisance'' dusts. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this reduced limit will protect exposed workersfrom safety and health risks associated with exposure to cellulose dustin the workplace. These adverse effects include eye and skin irritation,coughing, interference with vision, loss of the ability to concentrate,and accidents. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for cellulose.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 10 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STEL of 20 mg/m\3\. Nitrapyrin is a crystallinesubstance. Nitrapyrin's very low vapor pressure limit makes hazardous inhalation exposuresunlikely. Torkelson (as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 428) has reported feedingdogs and rats a dosage of 15 mg/kg daily for 93 days. He observed no adverseeffects in appearance, behavior, growth, food consumption, body and organweight, mortality, or blood chemistry, and no tissue or organ changes.OSHA proposes a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for this dust, which is the limitthat OSHA is proposing for all nuisance dusts to protect workers from thehealth and safety risks associated with exposure to these dusts. With regardto the 20-mg/m\3\ STEL, the ACGIH (1986) provided no basis for this limit.OSHA therefore requests additional information that will assist the Agencyin determining the need for the 20-mg/m\3\ STEL. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for nitrapyrin.

The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs is greater than 8 g/kg (DowChemical Company 1973). Long-term (two-year) studies of rats and dogs fedat levels of 15 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg per day, respectively, showed no adverseeffects. Similarly, there were no adverse effects on fertility, gestation,viability, or lactation in rats and rabbits, and no increase in teratogenicity(Dow Chemical Company 1973). The chronic toxicity of clopidol is also reportedto be low (ACGIH 1986, p. 141). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for clopidol, the same limitas for all nuisance dusts.

Madinaveitia (1956) has determined that this substanceis a hematinic agent in animals. OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for dicyclopentadienyliron.

The only report of ill effects from emery dust inhalation is a report ofa case of pneumoconiosis occurring in France, and it is questionable whetherthis incident was caused by emery dust or silica impurities in the dust<T3>(Archives des Maladies Professionelles de Medcin du Travail et de Securite</T3>1970). Exposure to emery dust containing less than 1 percent silicaproduces little if any effect on the health of exposed workers; it doesnot affect the lungs or produce organic disease at commonly encounteredlevels (ACGIH 1986, pp. 21, 229). OSHA is therefore proposing a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA, total dust, for emery,in keeping with the Agency's decision to lower the TWA for all nuisancedusts.

No. 1178</ITAG>Fibrous glass dust is used primarily for thermal and acoustical insulationof residential and commercial buildings. There is currently no OSHA limitgoverning occupational exposure to fibrous glass dust. The ACGIH (1986)has established a 10-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA, reflecting its belief that a nuisance-dustlimit is appropriate. NIOSH (1977) recommended a 5-mg/m\3\ 10-hour TWAlimit for total dust and a 3-fibers/cc limit for airborne fibers less than3.5 um in diameter and longer than 10 um in length. Epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to fibrous glass dust have generallyfailed to detect any significant increase in respiratory effects. One studyof 2,028 workers (Nasr et al. 1976) did not identify any increased prevalenceof abnormal radiographic findings among production workers compared tooffice workers; results of spirometric tests and administration of a chronicbronchitis questionnaire did not discern any difference in health betweenworkers with the heaviest exposure and those with minimal exposure. Anotherstudy of 416 retired workers reported no difference in overall mortalityor morbidity rates compared to general population rates (Enterline andHenderson 1975). Bayliss et al. (1976) failed to find any excess in overallmortality or lung cancer among 1,448 workers, but did report an excessof mortality from nonmalignant respiratory disease; the authors could notattribute this excess to fibrous glass because smoking histories were notgenerally available. A review of 691 physicians' reports of adverse effectscaused by exposure to vitreous fibers identified 66 reports of nondisablingupper respiratory tract symptoms (Milby and Wolf 1969). In animal studies, intratracheal injection of thin glass fibers longerthan 10 um into guinea pigs produced peribronchiolar fibrosis (Kuschnerand Wright 1976). When such fibers were injected into the abdomen of rats,a dose-related increase in sarcomas and mesotheliomas resulted (Stantonand Wrench 1972; Wagner et al. 1973; Pott and Friedrichs 1972). The responsemimics that found with asbestos, but the magnitude of the response is generallyless than is found with asbestos. NIOSH (1977) did not consider fibrousglass to present a carcinogenic hazard after reviewing these data. Based on the lack of reported adverse health effects in epidemiologic studies,the ACGIH (1986) considered fibrous glass dust to be essentially a nuisancedust and applied a 10-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA. In contrast, NIOSH (1977) concludedthat ``available data are sufficient to demonstrate that fibrous glassdoes not act like an inert or nuisance dust because it can produce fibrosisin animals and respiratory tract irritation in humans'' (NIOSH 1977, p.94). Relying on several investigations that showed a lack of adverse effectsamong workers exposed to mean respirable fiber concentrations generallyless than 5 to 6 f/cc, NIOSH recommended that exposures be limited to 3f/cc for fibers 3.5 um or less in diameter and greater than 10 um in length.In addition, NIOSH recommended that exposures to total fibrous glass dustbe limited to 5 mg/m\3\ as a 10-hour TWA. The 10-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA considers only the health effects associated withfibrous glass particles. However, the PEL will also be applied by OSHAto situations where the fibrous form of this material is present. Recentconcerns have emerged regarding the potential carcinogenicity of the longfibers (TIMA 1988). While a 3-fibers/cc limit for long, thin fibers hasalso been proposed by NIOSH, it is impossible in this rulemaking to adequatelyevaluate that limit for the fibrous form of this substance. Therefore,as an interim measure, OSHA proposes that a 5-mg/m\3\ TWA be adopted asthe PEL for fibrous glass dust. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will establish a new limit for fibrous glass dust if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.Because of the concern with the fibrous forms of this substance, feasibilityis not expected to be a problem at this level. If future information andpriorities indicate the need for a more restrictive standard for the fibrousform of this material, OSHA will initiate individual-substance rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="26">GLYCERIN (MIST) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 56-81-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>OHCHOHCH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Glycerin was long considered to be nontoxic; however, more recent informationhas indicated that the mist may be injurious to the kidneys at very highexposure levels (Campanacci 1965). Ackerman, Bassler, and Wagner (1975)have reported that glycerin mist is easily metabolized and excreted. Inthe adult human of average weight, 2 grams of glycerol can be metabolizedand excreted in an 8-hour workday. At this metabolic and elimination rate,the ACGIH believes that no ill effects are likely to occur as a resultof exposure at or below 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, the level set fornuisance dusts (ACGIH 1986, p. 286).OSHA proposes a limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for glycerin mist, which is thelevel the Agency is proposing for all inert dusts. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for glycerin mist. Atthe time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.However, OSHA notes that glycerin may not be truly inert, as evidencedby the study of Campanacci (1943).

OSHA's 8-hour TWA for all nuisance dusts is 15 mg/m\3\.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for graphite as totaldust. Synthetic graphite is a crystalline form of carbon made from high-temperaturetreatment of coal or petroleum products; it has the same properties asnatural graphite. Meiklejohn reported that synthetic graphite injectedintraperitoneally in mice produced effects characteristic of inert dusts(1958). In humans, exposure to natural graphite has long been associated with thedevelopment of pneumoconiosis (Koopman 1924; Ruttner et al. 1952; Pendergasset al. 1967). Lister (1961, 1972) reported fibrotic changes in the lungsof a worker who had been engaged for 17 years in the production and millingof synthetic graphite. Other reports of lung injury caused by exposureto graphite have not distinguished between the form of the graphite (i.e.,natural or synthetic) causing the injury; in addition, exposures to impurities,such as quartz silica, were involved in many of the reported cases (ACGIH1986, p. 291). OSHA is proposing to reduce the 8-hour TWA limit for all the nuisance dustsfrom 15 mg/m\3\ to 10 mg/m\3\, to protect against the health and safetyrisks potentially associated with dust exposures in the workplace.

Malathion is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide having a relativelylow level of toxicity; some authors have determined that malathion is approximately\1/100\th as toxic as parathion (Johnson et al. 1952). Rats fed malathionat a concentration of 100 ppm for 2 years exhibited no toxic effects (Hazletonand Holland 1953). Several occupational and research exposures involvingscientists or human volunteers produced no change in blood cholinesteraseor other effects (Rider et al. 1959; Hayes et al. 1960; Culver et al. 1956).Fatalities have been reported in the Japanese and Indian literature, butthese deaths have always involved extremely high doses of malathion (Chabra1970; Horiguchi 1973). Thus, malathion's principal workplace effect isthat it acts like a nuisance dust. NIOSH concurs in this view (NIOSH 1978i)and recommends a higher TWA (15 mg/m\3\) for this substance than wouldbe permitted by the ACGIH. The 10-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA is part of a generally accepted, broad guidelineto limit exposure to nuisance dusts; the 15-mg/m\3\ REL represents an earlierapproach to the control of these substances. As discussed in this section,nuisance dusts must be controlled to prevent skin, respiratory tract, andeye irritation, as well as a variety of other effects. This level is readilyattainable in the workplace, using generally available industrial hygienepractices. OSHA is therefore proposing a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for malathionwith a skin notation.

Lehman also determinedthat 100 ppm for 2 years is the lowest dietary level producing no effectin rats: this corresponds to a level of 350 mg/man/day. Results of anotherdietary study indicated that rats fed 200 ppm methoxychlor for 2 yearswere not affected in terms of growth or survival (Hodge, Maynard, and Blanchet1952). Tegeris and co-workers reported that dogs fed 1 g/kg daily for 6months showed weight loss; most animals died within 9 weeks when the dietarylevel was increased to 2 g/kg daily (Tegeris, Earl, Smalley, and Curtis1966). Morgan and Hickenbottom (1978) reported that male Holtzman ratsfed 10, 40, 160. or 640 mg/kg for 24 hours showed no liver abnormalities.Extrapolating from animal data, Lehman estimated the dose levels that wouldproduce toxic effects in humans as follows: The fatal oral dose would be450 grams; adverse health effects would occur at 6430 mg/kg orally; and2414 mg/kg is the level at which dermal effects would be predicted to occur(Lehman 1954).

The ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TWA limitof 10 mg/m\3\ for mineral wool fiber as total dust containing less than1 percent quartz. Rock or mineral wool is composed of mineral fibers producedby blowing steam or air through molten furnace slag; the fibers containless than 1 percent quartz, and the substance is therefore vitreous. In a study of cats, the only ill effects of inhalation that were observedwere pulmonary changes attributed to silicate deposition (Fairhall, Webster,and Bennett 1935). A Russian study showed that mineral wool dust containinglittle free silica and moderate amounts of combined silica produced moderatediffuse and nodular sclerosis in the lungs of rats after 2 to 3 months(Grimailovskaya et al. 1957). The ACGIH (1986, p. 414) states that theseconclusions are suspect, however, because rat lungs show only cellularfoci even after 2 to 3 months of exposure to heavy quartz dust; the ACGIHbelieves that the Soviet investigators were not familiar with the chronicbronchitis that is endemic in rats. Chronic exposure of 84 workers to mineral wool (with a free silica contentof no more than 0.5 percent) for from 7 to 29 years resulted in no X-rayevidence of silicosis (Carpenter and Spolyor 1945). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for mineral wool fiber as totaldust containing less than 1 percent quartz. This is the limit being proposedfor all inert or ``nuisance'' particulates.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10mg/m\3\ for total dust containing less than 1 percent quartz. Pentaerythritolis an odorless, white, crystalline solid. Pentaerythritol has a low acute toxicity and only mild irritative effects.Rats exposed at 11,000 mg/m\3\ for 6 hours were reported to show no illeffects from a single exposure, and rats, dogs, and guinea pigs exposed6 hours daily for 90 days also showed no effects (Keplinger and Kay 1964).The oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in guinea pigs and mice are 11.3 g/kg and 22.5 g/kg, respectively;rats survived oral doses as high as 16 g/kg. At higher doses, animals displayeddiarrhea, tremors, ataxia, and loss of righting reflex (Keplinger and Kay1964). Daily applications of a saturated aqueous solution of technicalpentaerythritol to rabbit skin produced no significant irritation; a singleapplication of 10 g/kg aqueous paste on intact or abraded rabbit skin producedno evidence of percutaneous absorption (Keplinger and Kay 1964; Hercules,Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 462). Instillation of a 50-percent aqueoussuspension into the conjunctival sac of rabbits' eyes resulted in slighttransient irritation (Hercules, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 462).Human volunteers are reported to have eliminated 85 percent of dietarypentaerythritol unchanged in the urine within 30 hours. A slight and transientincrease in apparent blood sugar that was proportional to the ingesteddose appeared in these subjects soon after administration (Berlow, Barth,and Snow 1958). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for pentaerythritol,which is the level the Agency is proposing for all nuisance dusts.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for perlite astotal dust containing less than 1 percent quartz. Perlite is a naturalvolcanic glass. It is essentially an amorphous mineral consisting of fusedsodium potassium aluminum silicate.Perlite is reported to have a free silica content varying from zero to3 percent (Anderson, Selvig, Baur et al. 1956; Perlite Institute, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 467). In its processed crude and expanded forms, perliteis reported to have a measurable quartz content of 0.4 percent quartz and0.2 percent cristobalite (Sheckler, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 467). Thereare no published reports of adverse physiologic effects from exposure toperlite dust. OSHA has preliminarily concluded that perlite is non-toxic when airborneconcentrations are maintained at levels of 10 mg/m\3\ or below and whenits quartz content is limited to a level below 1 percent crystalline silica.For these reasons, the Agency proposes a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for totalperlite dust containing less than 1 percent quartz, which is the limitbeing proposed for all nuisance particulates. OSHA believes that this limitwill protect exposed workers from the risk of safety and health hazardsassociated with workplace exposures to inert particulates; these risksinclude the danger of accidents, interference with vision, and eye andskin irritation.

Picloram has low acute oral toxicity, with LD<T2>50</T2> values of 3.75 g/kg for rats, 1.5 g/kg for mice, and 2.0 g/kgfor rabbits (NIOSH 1979). Two-year feeding studies showed no ill effectsin albino rats and beagle dogs from ingestion of doses up to and including150 mg/kg/day (McCallister and Leng 1969). At 225 mg/kg/day, rats displayedmoderate liver and kidney changes and, in females, slight body weight lossafter 90 days (McCallister and Leng 1969). McCallister and Leng (1969)reported no fertility, reproduction, or lactation effects in albino ratsfed at levels of up to 3000 ppm (0.3 percent) in a 3-generational study.However, maternal toxicity in rats was reported at dietary levels of 750and 1000 mg/kg administered during days 6 through 15 of gestation, butneither teratogenic nor neonatal effects were observed when sub-toxic ormaternally toxic doses of picloram were administered during organogenesis(Thomson et al. 1972). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has concludedthat picloram is not carcinogenic in mice or rats (NCI 1977). OSHA proposes a TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ and a 15-minute STEL of 20 mg/m\3\for picloram. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combined limitwill minimize the risk of systemic effects, such as liver and kidney damage,potentially associated with exposure to this substance in the absence ofany OSHA PEL.

The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for Portland cement as total dust containing lessthan 1 percent quartz. Portland cement refers to a class of hydraulic cementsthat are odorless gray powders containing less than 1 percent crystallinesilica. Portland cement is insoluble in water and contains tri- and di-calciumsilicate, with varying amounts of alumina, tricalcium aluminate, and ironoxide. Intraperitoneal injection of Portland cement in guinea pigs produced anabsorptive reaction, which is typical of inert particulates. Portland cementis eventually eliminated from tissue and is generally considered harmlesswhen ingested (Miller and Sayers 1941). In a study of industrial exposures, Gardner and associates (1939) foundno evidence of Portland-cement-related pneumoconiosis in 2,278 workerswho had been heavily exposed to this substance for prolonged periods oftime (Gardner, Durkan, Brumfiel, and Sampson 1939). Conflicting reportsof pneumoconiosis (Parmeggiani 1951; Prosperi and Barsi 1957) are attributedto the presence of silica in the inhaled dust rather than to exposure toPortland cement itself (ACGIH 1986, p. 494). Cement dermatitis does occuramong exposed workers, however, as a consequence of the alkaline, abrasive,and hygroscopic properties of the wet cement, which cause general irritationof the skin (Schwartz, Tulipan, and Birmingham 1957).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ for Portland cement astotal dust containing less than 1 percent quartz. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect workers against the safety risksassociated with on-the-job exposures to inert particulates.

Guinea pigs exposed to silicon carbide dust and infected withthe tubercle bacteria developed tuberculopneumoconiotic lesions (Gross,Westrick, and McNerney 1959). Miller and Sayers (1941) observed that intraperitonealinjection of guinea pigs produced no reaction. Bruusgaard (1945) found that X-rays of 10 out of 32 workers exposed toaverage levels of 34 mppcf of silicon carbide for 15 years or more demonstratedpulmonary changes: these 10 workers also were tuberculin-positive.

Temephos is currently regulatedunder OSHA's nuisance dust limit of 15 mg/m\3\. The ACGIH limit is 10 mg/m\3\as an 8-hour TWA. Temephos may be a white crystalline solid or a viscousbrown liquid. In rats and mice, temephos has an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 400 mg/kg or greater. Various animal species tolerated dosesof 10 mg/kg without clinical effect and 1 mg/kg without effect on cholinesteraseactivity (Gaines, Kimbrough, and Laws 1967). Laws et al. (1967) revealedthat human volunteers consuming oral doses of temephos at levels of 256mg/man/day for 5 days, or 64 mg/man/day for 4 weeks, evidenced no detectableeffects on erythrocyte or plasma cholinesterase levels. Murphy and Cheever(1972) reported that 1 mg of temephos per liter of drinking water producesno effect. These authors found that rat liver carboxylesterases were atleast 30 times more sensitive to inhibition from temephos than cholinesterases.Assuming that human liver carboxylesterases are proportionately more sensitivethan cholinesterases, it is estimated that significant inhibition of thesecarboxylesterases could occur as a result of consuming 2 liters of drinkingwater containing 1 mg/L of temephos. Although nonspecific liver carboxylesteraseis not critical for normal physiologic function, adverse effects on thisenzyme could increase the susceptibility of exposed individuals to chemicalsand drugs that contain carboxylesterase linkages (ACGIH 1986, p. 557).The ACGIH derived the limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for temephos from studiesof malathion, which has an acute LD<T2>50</T2> of 2100 mg/kg in rats, or roughly one-half that of temephos.Because humans tolerate 16 mg/day oral doses of malathion without effectson blood cholinesterase levels, the ACGIH believes the 10 mg/m\3\ limitis appropriate for temephos (ACGIH 1986, p. 557). OSHA is proposing a limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for temephos.

More recent studies have revealed incidences of pulmonary fibrosisassociated with encephalopathy that stemmed directly from exposure to aluminumdust, which is frequently coated with stearic acid (<T3>British Journal of Industrial Medicine </T3>1962); the ACGIH (1986,p. 646) is uncertain of the relevance of this report to zinc stearate exposures.Observations of long-term workers exposed to this dust in the rubber industryrevealed no adverse effects of exposure (B.F. Goodrich Rubber Company,private communication, as cited in the ACGIH 1986, p. 646). The ACGIH considerszinc stearate dust to be biologically inert and has assigned a nuisancedust limit to this substance. OSHA is proposing a 10-mg/m\3\ limit for this dust (measured as total dust)because the Agency believes that all of its nuisance dust limits shouldbe decreased to 10 mg/m\3\ as 8-hour TWAs. The Agency believes that thislimit will prevent the safety and health risks associated with high workplaceexposures to these dusts. These risks include accidents, interference withvision, and eye and skin irritation. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for zinc stearate. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ZINC OXIDE, TOTAL DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-13-2; Chemical Formula: ZnO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1438</ITAG>Zinc oxide dust is a white or pale-yellow powder. OSHA currently has noexposure limit specifically for zinc oxide as total dust. The ACGIH establisheda limit of 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA for zinc oxide, measured as totaldust.According to Turken and Thompson (1926), exposure to finely divided zincoxide dust can produce effects similar to those for metal fume fever. Beeckmansand Brown (1963) reported that catalytically active zinc oxide dust ismore toxic when treated with ultraviolet light. Aside from these considerations,the ACGIH considered zinc oxide dust to be a nuisance dust. OSHA is proposing a limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for zinc oxide as total dust, thesame as for all nuisance dusts. The Agency preliminarily concludes thatthis limit will protect exposed individuals from the risk of exposure tothis dust in the workplace, which can result in safety and health hazardssuch as accidents, skin and respiratory irritation, and interference withvision. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit for zinc oxide. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk. Preliminary Conclusions OSHA's Current 8-hour inert or nuisance dust standard (29 CFR 1910.1000,Table Z-3) was adopted from the 1968 ACGIH TLV-TWA of 15 mg/m\3\ for totaldust and 5 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust. At the time, the ACGIH consideredthe 15 mg/m\3\ value to be ``an acceptable limit of good hygienic practice''based on the then prevailing ``lack of knowledge'' of any adverse effectsat exposure levels below this value (ACGIH Documentation 1966). Shortlyafter OSHA adopted the ACGIH's 1968 limit, the ACGIH revised its limitdownward to 10 mg/m\3\ for total dust and 5 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust.In justifying this reduction, the ACGIH noted that the lower levels would``result in appreciable improvement of working conditions in plants wherethe old limit of 15 mg/m\3\ formerly prevailed'' (ACGIH 1971, p. 190).OSHA preliminarily concludes that the proposed TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\for this group of substances that cause a variety of adverse effects willsubstantially reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract, eye, and skinirritation and of danger to the safety of workers distracted by the presenceof these substances in the workplace. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing revised or new limits for nuisance dusts. OSHA willestablish new limits for the nuisance dusts if the Agency determines thatthese limits will substantially reduce significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Odor andTaste Effects </ITAG>Introduction This category includes four substances that have obnoxious odors. The Agencyrecognizes that working in atmospheres containing detectable concentrationsof these substances will endanger workers by distracting them from thetask at hand and creating safety hazards. For three of these substances,OSHA is retaining its current 8-hour TWAs. For one substance, propyleneglycol monomethyl ether, a new limit is being proposed. OSHA is proposingthe retention or adoption of these limits based on the data described below,which show a NOE level for these intolerable taste and odor effects. TableC11-1 shows the substances included in this group and their OSHA and ACGIHlimits, as well as their CAS and HS numbers. Description of the Health Effects The substances in this group have obnoxious odors and cannot willinglybe tolerated by most workers for any extended period of time. Because odordetection occurs at very low concentrations for many of these chemicals,the proposed limit has been set at a level below the concentration at whichthe odor is intolerable to employees. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 588 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>The evidence for each of the substances in this group describes their adverseeffects both in animals and humans. These effects, which range from nauseato narcosis, generally occur at levels higher than the limits for thesesubstances, which are based not only on toxicological effects but alsoon the basis of the intolerable odors associated with their presence inworkroom air. Because odor effects range in severity from distracting tointolerable, these limits have been set at the concentration at which theodor becomes so seriously objectionable as to create a risk of safety hazards.Dose-Response Relationships and Odor Effects Odor effects are threshold effects, although there is wide variation inindividual odor response, i.e., in the ability to detect odor. Becauseof this wide variation and the phenomenon of olfactory fatigue, odor isnot a reliable indicator of airborne concentrations and should not be reliedon to provide a warning of overexposure. The following paragraphs describeOSHA's preliminary findings with respect to the substances in this group.<ITAG tagnum="26">ISOPROPYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-20-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHOCH(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1226</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 500 ppm TWA for isopropyl ether. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 250 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 310 ppm for this liquid,which has a sharp, sweet odor similar to that of ether.Animal studies have shown that exposures to high concentrations cause narcosisand death (Machle, Scott, and Treon 1939). Twenty exposures at a 1-percentvapor concentration produced intoxication and depression but no significantblood or weight changes. In rabbits, the minimum lethal dose has been reportedto be 5 to 6.5 g/kg. The liquid is an irritant to the skin and mucous membranesand causes dermatitis in rabbits on repeated exposure (Machle, Scott, andTreon 1939). Humans exposed for 15 minutes at 300 ppm experienced no irritation butcomplained about the objectionable odor of isopropyl ether; eye and noseirritation was experienced as a result of 5-minute exposures to 800 ppm.A 15-minute exposure to 500 ppm was not reported by subjects to be irritating(Silverman, Schulte, and First 1946). The available health evidence for this substance may not be sufficientto support a revision of the current limit, and OSHA is accordingly retainingits current limit. However, there may be other health effects informationon isopropyl ether, and OSHA is specifically requesting any available informationfrom the public to support lower limits for this substance. The publicmay also wish to address the topic of material impairment of health, asdiscussed in section 6(b) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="26">PHENYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 101-84-8; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1314</ITAG>OSHA currently has an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm for phenyl ether. The ACGIHrecommends the same TWA and the addition of a 2-ppm 15-minute STEL forphenyl ether vapor. Phenyl ether is a colorless liquid or solid with alow volatility; its vapor has a disagreeable odor. The acute oral lethal dose is approximately 4 g/kg for rats and guineapigs, and single doses of between 1 and 2 g/kg administered to variousspecies have shown no liver, spleen, kidney, thyroidal or gastrointestinaltoxicities in surviving animals (Vogel, Snyder, and Schulman 1964). Repeatedinhalation studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs have shown that 20 exposuresto 4.9 ppm for 5 days per week, 7 hours per day produced no adverse effects.Eye and nasal irritation were observed in rats and rabbits exposed at 10ppm (Hefner, Leong, Kociba, and Gehring 1975). Skin and eye irritationhave been reported only as a result of prolonged undiluted exposures. Thereis no evidence that skin absorption presents a health hazard (ACGIH 1986,p. 475). The primary complaints associated with human exposures to phenyl ethervapor are of disagreeable odor and occasional nausea (Hake and Rowe, ascited in Patty 1963, p. 1698). The available health evidence for this substance may not be sufficientto support a revision of this current limit, and OSHA is therefore retainingits limit for phenyl ether. However, there may be other health effectsinformation on phenyl ether, and OSHA is specifically requesting any availableinformation from the public to support lower limits for this substance.The public may also wish to comment on the topic of material impairmentof health, as discussed in section 6(b) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="26">PROPYLENE GLYCOL MONOMETHYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-98-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CHOHCH<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1343</ITAG>OSHA has no current standard for propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME).The ACGIH recommends a TWA of 100-ppm and a STEL of 150 ppm; NIOSH hasno REL. Exposure to propylene glycol monomethyl ether causes anesthesia at a levelof approximately 1000 ppm, eye tearing at levels above 100 ppm, and anobjectionable odor at 100 ppm (Stewart, Baretta, Dodd, and Torkelson 1970).Ingestion of 3 g/kg in a 35-day period caused minor changes in the liversand kidneys of rats, and repeated dermal applications of 7 to 10 ml/kg/daycaused death in rats treated over a 90-day period (Rowe, McCollister, Spenceret al. 1954). The proposed PELs for PGME of 100 ppm TWA and 150 ppm STEL are designedto protect workers from experiencing this objectionable effect, which isseriously distracting. In addition, the proposed levels will ensure thatworkers will not experience the eye irritation reported to be associatedwith exposures to propylene glycol monomethyl ether at levels above 100ppm. OSHA preliminarily finds that the proposed limits will reduce therisks potentially associated with previously uncontrolled exposures tothis substance. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for propylene glycol monomethyl ether.<ITAG tagnum="26">VINYL TOLUENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 25013-15-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>CH=CH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1427</ITAG>The current OSHA standard for vinyl toluene is 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH recommends a TWA of 50 ppm with a 100-ppm short-term exposurelimit. Vinyl toluene is a colorless liquid with a strong, disagreeableodor. Wolf, Rowe, McCollister et al. (1956) noted fatty degeneration of the liverand an increase in kidney and liver weights in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits,and monkeys exposed to approximately 100 7- to 8-hour exposures of vinyltoluene at 1250 ppm. Some deaths occurred among the rats in this group.Animals exposed to vinyl toluene at 600 ppm appeared normal and showedno blood or urine abnormalities, no gross or microscopic tissue changes,and no changes in growth rate or organ weight (Wolf, Rowe, McCollisteret al. 1956). Human volunteers reported eye and nose irritation at 400 ppm, and objectionableodor at 300 ppm. At 50 ppm, the odor of vinyl toluene was detectable, butno irritation was experienced (ACGIH 1986, p. 630). The available health evidence for this substance may not be sufficientto support a revision of the current limit, and OSHA is accordingly retainingits limit. However, there may be other health effects information on vinyltoluene, and OSHA is specifically requesting any available informationon vinyl toluene from the public to support lowering the limit for thissubstance. The public may also wish to comment on the topic of materialimpairment of health, as discussed in section 6(b) of the Act.Preliminary Conclusions For the one chemical in this group for which OSHA is proposing a new limit,the Agency preliminarily finds that exposure at the uncontrolled levelscurrently permitted places workers at risk of experiencing the adverseeffects associated with this noxious substance. These effects include irritation,distraction, discomfort, and, if exposure is sufficiently severe, dangerto affected employees and their co-workers. This risk is created by thesafety risks generated by propylene glycol monomethyl ether's intolerableodor. For the three substances_isopropyl ether, phenyl ether, and vinyl toluene_forwhich OSHA is at present retaining its current limits, the available healthevidence may not be sufficient to support a revision of these limits. However,OSHA is soliciting additional information from the public on the healtheffects associated with occupational exposure to these substances to supportrevision or retention of these limits. At the time of the final rule, OSHAwill make a final determination, based on the best available evidence,of whether to retain or revise the limits for these substances. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Substances for Which Proposed Limits are Based on Avoidance ofAdverse Health Effects Caused by Exposure to Analogous Substances </ITAG>IntroductionOSHA is proposing limits for 73 substances on the basis of their toxicologicand structural similarities to other chemical substances that create significantrisks of systemic toxicity, ocular effects, kidney or liver damage, andother similarly adverse health effects. For 46 of these substances, OSHAhas not previously had Z table limits. For an additional 12 substances,OSHA is proposing to reduce the 8-hour TWA, and in 13 cases, the Agencyis proposing to retain its 8-hour limit and to add a STEL to supplementthe TWA. OSHA proposes to delete the 8-hour limit and add a ceiling inthe case of acetic anhydride and to delete a ceiling limit and add an 8-hourTWA for another substance. Table C12-1 shows these substances, their CASand HS numbers, and their current OSHA and ACGIH limits. NIOSH has RELsfor four substances in this category. Description of the Health Effects The health effects associated with occupational exposures to the diversegroup of substances shown in Table C12-1 vary widely, ranging from sensoryirritation, systemic toxicity, ocular effects, and neuropathy to renaland liver damage. This variation in target organs reflects the fact thatthe substances in this group have not been grouped on the basis of theirtoxic effects or mechanism of action; instead, they are considered togetherbecause the specific limits proposed for them have been determined on thebasis of toxic effects caused by exposure to analogous chemicals. TableC12-2 shows these substances, along with their adverse health effects andanalogous compounds. The use of analogy is a reasonable basis for making estimates because ofthe similarities in structure and activity of these substances. Industrialhygienists frequently use this approach. The limits for these chemicalshave thus been set based on dose-response information for other compoundsthat are of similar chemical structure or that have a similar mechanismof action. For example, limits are being proposed for a number of compoundsthat are known cholinesterase inhibitors (including diazinon, disulfoton,and monocrotophos); since direct dose-response data are not available,OSHA has proposed limits that are similar to the proposed limit for parathion,another cholinesterase inhibitor for which adequate dose-response dataare available. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 007 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2596-602 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>It is important to note that the establishment of a limit on the basisof analogy to other substances does not reflect a lack of information showingthat the substance is toxic; acute animal data are available demonstratingthe toxicity of all of the substances for which limits are being proposedin this category, and cases of human poisoning caused by exposure to manyof them are reported. Thus the proposed limits reflect more than theoreticalconsiderations of chemical structure and physiologic reaction: The hazardousnature of exposure has been demonstrated beyond doubt, although the preciselevel at which it will occur cannot be foretold with certainty.

No. 1003</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for acetic anhydride is 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has recommended a TLV of 5 ppm as a ceiling, based on analogy withacetic acid and the substance's irritant potential. Acetic anhydride isa colorless, mobile, strongly refractive liquid with a strong odor.In one study, rats inhaling 1000 ppm of acetic anhydride for 4 hours survived,but 2000 ppm was fatal (Smyth 1956). In human studies, eye, nose, and throatirritation has been observed, and it has been suggested that bronchialand lung injury may occur as a consequence of exposure. (Henderson andHaggard 1943). Skin burns and serious corneal injury have been reportedin industrial settings when workers came into contact with the liquid (McLaughlin1946), and acetic anhydride is a marked lacrimator (Fairhall 1949). In light of acetic anhydride's potential for acute toxicity, OSHA is proposingto replace the current 5-ppm 8-hour TWA with a 5-ppm ceiling. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers from the riskof ocular and respiratory effects associated with high, short-term exposuresto acetic anhydride at the current level. The proposed limit will substantiallyreduce this risk among industrially exposed workers. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for acetic anhydrideif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACRYLIC ACID </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-10-7; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCO<T2>2</T2>H </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1009</ITAG>OSHA has no current permissible exposure limit for acrylic acid. The ACGIHhas a recommended 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm. Acrylic acid is a colorless, corrosiveliquid with a distinctive acrid odor. Acrylic acid is known to polymerize explosively with amines, ammonia, oleum,and chlorosulfonic acid, and it is incompatible with strong alkalis andpure nitrogen. Occupational exposure to acrylic acid usually occurs whenthe chemical is used in the form of methyl, ethyl, or butyl esters in themanufacture of acrylic resins. Data indicate that the oral LD<T2>50 </T2>in rats is between 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg (Dow Chemical Company,1977), and the skin absorption LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 0.95 ml/kg (Smyth et al. 1962). Another studyindicates that rabbits given acrylic acid orally had no ill effects ata level of 0.025 mg/kg (Klimkina et al. 1969), and Gage reports that ratsexposed to 80 ppm for 6 hours daily for 20 days showed no adverse effects(1970). Case reports indicate that acute exposures to acrylic acid in workers havecaused skin burns, eye burns, and upper respiratory effects (ACGIH, 1986,p. 14). OSHA preliminarily concludes that an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm is necessaryto protect exposed workers from the risk of nasal and eye irritation potentiallyassociated with exposure to acrylic acid at the previously uncontrolledlevel. This limit will substantially reduce this risk and prevent recurrencesof the burns and irritation previously associated with industrial exposures.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor acrylic acid. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate anew limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ALUMINUM (ALKYLS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: Al </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH recommends an 8-hourTLV-TWA limit of 2 mg/m\3\ for aluminum (soluble salts) and 2 mg/m\3\ forthe aluminum alkyls. The ACGIH's limits for aluminum soluble salts have been set on the basisof the amount of hydrolized acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuricacid, in their acid compounds. For example, three mols of hydrochloricacid (HCl) hydrolize from one mol of aluminum chloride; since HCl has aPEL of 5 ppm, a PEL of 2 mg/m\3\ for aluminum chloride, a soluble saltof aluminum, would provide the same degree of protection from irritationas that provided by this current limit for HCl. The acute toxicity of aluminumchloride is generally representative of the toxicity of all of the solublesalts of aluminum. For the aluminum alkyls, toxicity data are sparse. However,all of the nonhalogenated alkyls decompose into aluminum oxide fume, andthe halogenated alkyls are even more irritating because of acid hydrolysis.OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m\3\ for the soluble salts andthe alkyls of aluminum. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limitswill protect against the risk of irritation and skin burns presented bythe acidic nature of these substances, to which workers can presently beexposed at uncontrolled levels. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing new limits for the alkyls and aluminum salts.

No. 1040</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for exposure to boron tribromide. The ACGIHrecommends a 1-ppm ceiling limit for boron tribromide, which is a colorless,fuming liquid that is decomposed by water and alcohol. Boron tribromide has a high potential for acute local irritation, and itspotential for systemic toxicity is analogous to that of hydrogen bromide(HBr). On decomposition, one molecule of boron tribromide would be expectedto produce three molecules of HBr (ACGIH 1986, p. 62). Animals repeatedly exposed to boron tribromide develop pneumonia, and exposureat 100 ppm caused a uniformly high mortality rate in six laboratory species(Stokinger, Spiegel et al. 1953). Rats, rabbits, and mice exposed at 1.5,3.4, or 12.8 ppm boron trifluoride developed pneumonitis and dental fluorosis,although at the lowest level tested, the evidence of pneumonitis was describedas ``marginal'' (Torkelson, Sadek, and Rowe 1961). Based on this evidence of boron tribromide's severe pulmonary toxicityat exposure levels below 4 ppm, OSHA preliminarily proposes a ceiling limitof 1 ppm. The Agency believes that this limit will protect workers fromthe risk of serious pulmonary damage associated with exposure to this substanceat the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for boron tribromide.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">BROMINE PENTAFLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7789-30-2; Chemical Formula: BrF<T2>5 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1043</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for bromine pentafluoride exposure. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 0.1 ppm. This substance is a pale-yellow liquidat temperatures below 40.3anddegrees;C; above this temperature, it is a colorless,pungent, and corrosive gas. Bromine pentafluoride has been shown to be acutely toxic in animals. Animalsexposed to bromine pentafluoride vapor at 500 ppm exhibited immediate symptomsof gasping, swollen eyelids, clouded corneas, tearing, salivation, andacute distress; these symptoms appeared after exposure for a period asshort as 3 minutes. Exposures to 50 ppm were fatal after 30 minutes, andchronic exposures above 3 ppm resulted in severe nephrosis in some animals,as well as marked hepatosis and severe respiratory involvement (The MathesonCo., Inc., as cited in ACGIH, p. 66). Bromine pentafluoride is toxicologicallymore active than free, elemental fluorine, and its toxicity appears tobe closely related to that of chlorine trifluoride (Horn and Wier 1955,1956). Chlorine trifluoride has caused severe toxicity and some fatalitiesin dogs and rats exposed to an average concentration of 1.17 ppm 6 hoursdaily for 6 months (Horn and Wier 1955). OSHA is proposing the adoption of a PEL of 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA toprevent the risk of serious systemic injury potentially associated withexposure to this substance at the levels permitted in the absence of anyOSHA limit. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce this risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for bromine pentafluoride.

In rabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50 </T2>for n-butyl acrylate was approximately 1800 mg/kg, comparedto 1235 mg/kg for methyl acrylate (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951). n-Butylacrylate has also been found to be mildly irritating to the skin and toproduce corneal necrosis in the unwashed eyes of rabbits (Holland 1974,unpublished memo, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 75). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm for n-butyl acrylate, basedon the similarity of the toxicological response of n-butyl acrylate tomethyl acrylate, for which OSHA has a 10 ppm TWA limit. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit is necessary to reduce the risk of skin irritationand corneal necrosis to which workers could be exposed in the absence ofan OSHA limit.

Animal studies indicate that contact with o-sec-butylphenol causes irritationof the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and may result in skin burns.A Dow Chemical Company study (1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 84) showedthat the oral and skin absorption LD<T2>50</T2>'s for guinea pigs ranged between 0.6 and 2.4 g/kg. Prolongedcontact of o-sec-butylphenol with the skin of these animals resulted inburns, whereas direct application to the eyes did not cause corneal injury.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 2700 mg/kg (Sax 1984), and rats exposed to saturatedair levels of this chemical survived for 7 hours (Dow Chemical Company1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 84). The intravenous LD<T2>50 </T2>for mice is 6 mg/kg (Sax 1984). Acute workplace exposures to o-sec-butylphenol have resulted in mild respiratoryirritation and skin burns (ACGIH 1986, p. 84).

Calcium hydroxide is a soft, white, odorless crystallinepowder with an alkaline, bitter taste. Calcium hydroxide is a moderately caustic irritant when it comes in contactwith the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported to be 7.34 g/kg (Smyth et al. 1969). Industrialexperience with this substance has not shown a high incidence of adversehealth effects. Calcium hydroxide has less alkalinity than the hydroxidesof the alkali series, and the ACGIH has suggested that limits for exposuresto calcium hydroxide should be based on its total alkalinity. Accordingto the ACGIH, since calcium hydroxide has 2.5 times the alkalinity of sodiumhydroxide, it should have a limit 2.5 times that of sodium hydroxide; thiswould set the limit for calcium hydroxide at 5 mg/m\3\. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit for calcium hydroxide of 5 mg/m\3\to protect against the risk of skin, eye, and mucous membrane irritationcaused by exposure to this substance at the uncontrolled levels permittedby the absence of any OSHA limit.

Calcium oxide is known to be a caustic and irritating material (Sax 1984);it produces severe irritation on contact with the mucous membranes andmoist skin. Significant irritation occurs from the local liberation ofheat and the dehydration of tissues resulting from the alkalinity of theslaked particles (ACGIH 1986, p. 92). Sax (1984) considers calcium oxide``a powerful caustic to living tissue.'' Exposure to calcium oxide can cause inflammation of the respiratory passagesand ulceration of the nasal septum (National Safety Council 1936; Schwartz,Tulipan, and Birmingham 1957). The inhalation of calcium oxide dust hasalso been linked to reports of pneumonia (International Labour Office 1934).However, the most frequent adverse response associated with exposure tocalcium oxide is irritation to the skin and eyes. The effects of exposureto calcium oxide are analogous to those of sodium hydroxide. OSHA proposes a PEL of 2 mg/m\3\ TWA for calcium hydroxide to afford protectionagainst the risk of skin and eye irritation. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat a 2-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA will substantially reduce this risk.

The ACGIH has establishedan 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 5 ppm for this colorlessand essentially odorless gas.The 1-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 360 ppm, and the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for the same species is 90 ppm (ACGIH 1986, p. 111). Carbonylfluoride hydrolyzes instantly on contact with moisture. Repeated exposure of animals to carbonyl fluoride is known to have metaboliceffects; it inhibits the fluoride-sensitive enzyme succinic dehydrogenasevia hydrolysis of carbonyl fluoride to hydrogen fluoride (Scheel, McMillan,and Phipps 1968). Carbonyl fluoride is also a strong irritant to the eyes,skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory tract (Sax 1984). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm and a 15-minute 5 ppm STELfor carbonyl fluoride; these limits are based on analogy to the 3-ppm TWAlimit being proposed for hydrogen fluoride. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat both a TWA and a STEL are necessary to provide protection againstthe risk of marked irritation and metabolic effects associated with exposureto carbonyl fluoride at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHAlimit.

No. 1075</ITAG>OSHA currently has no established limit for catechol. The ACGIH recommendsa TWA-TLV of 5 ppm. Catechol is a colorless crystalline solid that sublimesreadily and thus occurs in the vapor state at room temperature. Catechol is approximately 1.1 to 2.2 times more toxic than phenol, dependingon the route of exposure (Acute Toxicity Studies With Catechol 1974, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 112). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 300 mg/kg, or approximately half that of phenol.Percutaneous toxicity for catechol in rabbits is 800 mg/kg, only slightlygreater than the value for phenol. Eye and nose irritation, as well asmuscular spasms and tremor, have been observed in rats at a concentrationof 2800 mg/m\3\ catechol indicating that the acute respiratory toxicityof catechol is approximately one-third that of phenol (Acute Toxicity Studieswith Catechol 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1985, p. 112). Metabolic data indicatethat the urinary elimination rate of catechol in rabbits is only 10 percentof that of phenol (Williams 1959). In mice, catechol is easily absorbedthrough the skin and gastrointestinal tract (Forsyth and Quinel 1957).Additional data document a variety of dermal, respiratory, and systemictoxicities that are closely analogous to those of phenol in their metabolicactions (Harald, Nierenstein, and Road 1910; Dietering 1938; Cushny etal. 1940). Exposure to catechol causes an increase in blood pressure, and, at highdoses, kidney damage, eczematous dermatitis, and systemic illness (Harald,Nierenstein, and Road 1910; Dietering 1938; Cushny et al. 1940).

The ACGIH (1986, p. 132) notes that a 20-ppm 8-hour TWA ``provideslittle margin of safety, even assuming no chronic effects.'' 1-Chloro-1-nitropropane is the most acutely toxic of the fungicides knownas the chloronitropropanes. In an inhalation experiment, two rabbits wereexposed for 6 hours to a concentration of 393 ppm, after which one rabbitdied; at an average concentration of 2574 ppm, both rabbits died. Guineapigs tested under the same conditions survived these exposures. The oralLD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits determined in the same study was between 50 and100 mg/kg (Machle, Scott, Treon et al. 1945). Other members of this familyof fungicides show lesser skin and lung irritation but do have higher ingestiontoxicities (Patty 1963). Exposure to high concentrations of 1-chloro-1-nitropropanecan cause heart muscle, liver, and kidney damage (Patty 1963).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm.

Sax (1984) reports that cobalt carbonyl has a moderate-to-high order oftoxicity by the oral route. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in mice is 377.7 mg/kg; in rats, it is 753.8 mg/kg (Spiridonovaand Shabalina 1973). The hazards of exposure to the metal carbonyls rangefrom relatively low (for iron pentacarbonyl) to extremely serious (fornickel carbonyl) (Clayton and Clayton 1982, Vol. 2A, pp. 1797-1806); thegreater the toxicity of the metal and the more stable and volatile thecarbonyl, the more hazardous the compound. Exposure to any of the metalcarbonyls causes the same symptoms of nausea, dizziness, headache, substernalpain, coughing and dyspnea (Clayton and Clayton 1982).

Gaines reports the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male and female rats to be 108 and 76 mg/kg, respectively(1960). Other reports set the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>'s in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits at 76 to 150, 240 to 320,and 130 mg/kg, respectively (Pesticide Chemicals Official Compendium 1969).Hazleton Laboratories (1965) and Radeleff (1958) have shown much greatersusceptibility to diazinon in birds and calves, with the oral LD<T2>50</T2> being less than 10 mg/kg in some instances. However, susceptibilityto repeated doses is relatively consistent among species, with dogs showingsigns of poisoning at 9.3 mg/kg per day and rats showing complete inhibitionof red blood cell cholinesterase and marked inhibition of brain cholinesteraseat 50 mg/kg/day (Bruce, Howard, and Elsea 1955). Monkeys were poisonedat 5 mg/kg/day (Woodard and Cronin 1968). Chronic feeding studies in ratshave shown no chronic toxicity at 10, 100, and 1000 ppm. For many mammals,diazinon is less toxic than parathion (ACGIH TLV-TWA of 0.1 mg/m\3\), althoughthis is not true under some circumstances (ACGIH 1986, p. 172). In humans, Hayes reports that two patients were poisoned by a dermal diazinondosage of about 1.1 mg/kg (1963); however, Gassman (1957) reports no illeffects from an accidental ingestion of 30 mg/kg. One man received a doseof 250 mg/kg and recovered after treatment, which included gastric lavage(Bockel 1967). In tests, Geigy (1966) found that a series of doses of 0.05mg/kg/day for 28 days produced plasma cholinesterase inhibition, and ithas been suggested that the no-effect level for cholinesterase inhibitionin humans is 0.02 mg/kg/day. Skin absorption of diazinon occurs readily,and overexposures are associated with weakness, headache, blurred vision,salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, slurredspeech, and moist rales in the lungs (ACGIH 1986, p. 172). The Agency is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation,for diazinon. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits willprotect exposed workers from the risk of cholinesterase inhibition, weakness,headache, nausea, vomiting, and the other symptoms and signs of diazinonpoisoning resulting either from ingestion or dermal absorption at the levelspermitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.

FC-21is considered more toxic than the related difluorinated methanes. The majorhealth hazards associated with exposure to this substance are liver damage,cardiac sensitization, and narcosis. Freon-21 has a 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 49,900 ppm in rats (Tappan and Waritz 1964, as cited inACGIH 1986, p. 187). Within an hour, exposure to 100,000 ppm killed ratsand guinea pigs (Weigand 1971); other tests with guinea pigs and mice demonstratedthat concentrations of 50,000 ppm and higher cause unconsciousness or death(Nuckolls 1935, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 187; Booth and Bixby 1932).The clinical signs of overexposure include loss of coordination, tremors,narcosis, and prostration, as well as possible lung and liver changes (Tappanand Waritz 1964). Two-week exposures of rats to 10,000 ppm for 6 hours daily caused hepaticfailure or marked liver damage (Trochimowicz, Moore, and Chiu 1977). Aseries of 90-day exposures of rats and dogs to concentrations of 1000 and5000 ppm dichlorofluoromethane resulted in bilateral hair loss, cirrhosis,and excessive mortality in rats at both exposure levels; dogs exhibitedweight loss at both levels, but mild liver changes were observed only atthe 5000-ppm level (Trochimowicz, Lyon, Kelly, and Chiu 1977). Anotheruncompleted study reported liver pathology in rats repeatedly exposed for90 days at 500 ppm, and probable liver pathology from similar exposuresto 200 ppm; no hepatic effects were observed after exposure to 50 ppm (AlliedChemical Company 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 187). Two of 12 dogs exposed to 10,000 ppm FC-21 plus intravenous epinephrinedeveloped serious arrhythmia (Mullin, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 187).Dogs and monkeys (anesthetized) demonstrated tachycardia and hypotensionafter exposure to FC-21 levels between 50,000 and 100,000 ppm; bronchoconstrictionwas observed at 25,000 ppm (Aviado and Smith 1975; Belej and Aviado 1975).Anesthetized mice exposed to a concentration of 100,000 ppm FC-21 showedarrhythmia and cardiac sensitization to epinephrine (Aviado and Belej 1974).Pre-implantation loss has been reported in pregnant rats exposed to FC-21at 10,000 ppm on days 6 to 15 of gestation (Belej and Aviado 1975). OSHA proposes a TWA limit of 10 ppm for dichlorofluoromethane. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against therisks of hepatotoxic effects, cardiac sensitization, and narcosis thathave been shown to exist as a consequence of exposure to this substanceat levels substantially below the current OSHA limit.

In general, the toxicities of the methyl ketones increasewith increasing molecular weight; diethyl ketone is somewhat less toxicthan is methyl propyl ketone (NIOSH 1978). All of the ketones cause mucousmembrane and eye and skin irritation. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm for diethyl ketone, thesame limit being proposed for methyl propyl ketone.

The acute intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> values for DETA are reported to be 71 and 74 mg/kg for themouse and rat, respectively (Hine 1958). In the rat, the reported oraland percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> values are the same (1080 mg/kg); the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rabbit is 1090 mg/kg (Smyth et al. 1949). Exposureto 300 ppm of diethylene triamine vapor for 8 hours failed to kill anyof a group of exposed rats (Savitt 1955). Sutton (1963) has reported that DETA causes severe corneal injury; solutionsof 15 to 100 percent caused lasting corneal damage. If improperly  controlled,the vapor and liquid cause sensitization of the respiratory tract and skin(American Industrial Hygiene Association 1960). Dernehl demonstrated suchsensitization in a study reported in 1951. OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for diethylenetriamine. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits will protectworkers against the risk of skin and respiratory tract irritation and sensitizationpotentially associated with exposure to diethylene triamine in the absenceof any OSHA PEL. The skin notation is necessary to reduce the risk of skinsensitization resulting from contact with this substance.

The ACGIH recommends a limit of0.5 mg/m\3\ TWA for these yellow crystals. In most species, the acute oral toxicity of diquat is similar to that ofparaquat and ranges from 100 to 400 mg/kg in rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs.Cows experience more severe toxic effects, with an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 30 mg/kg. The 24-hour percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is greater than 400 mg cation/kg; no skin irritationor other ill effects were demonstrated at this level (Clark and Hurst 1970;Rowe and Wright 1965). Rats fed 1000 ppm daily (about 50 mg/kg/day) for2 years survived; reduced food intake and growth were the only consequencesobserved. At 500 ppm (about 25 mg/kg/day), the only ill effect observedwas a pathologic change in the eye. A dietary level of 10 ppm (about 0.5mg/kg/day) for 2 years did not induce cataract formation, but cataractsdo occur at higher levels, with pathology observed at the 500-ppm level;one in four animals demonstrated complete corneal opacity in one or bothlenses after 6 months at the 1000-ppm level. Cataract formation requiresprolonged exposure and is not induced by single high-level exposures (ACGIH1986, p. 222). Unlike paraquat, diquat does not produce lung damage in human or animalexposures. Acute poisoning may produce nonspecific respiratory distressas well as other nonspecific signs of poisoning. In humans, accidentalingestion has shown less toxic reactions than those associated with paraquat(Orepoulos and McEvoy 1969).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.5 mg/m\3\ TWA for diquat.

Pure disulfoton is an oily,colorless liquid; the technical grade is a brown liquid. The acute toxicity of disulfoton is very high by all laboratory-testedroutes of administration. For weanling rats, the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is reported to be 5.4 mg/kg; for adult rats, it is 9.4 mg/kg(Brodeur and Dubois 1963). The acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 6 mg/kg for adult female rats and 25 mg/kg for adult malerats (Gaines 1969). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>s for male and female rats are reported as 6.8 mg/kg and 2.3mg/kg, respectively (Brodeur and Dubois 1964). Rats have demonstrated anacquired tolerance for disulfoton (Brodeur and Dubois 1964). Metabolically, disulfoton is highly fat-soluble, and the compound apparentlyinterferes with mixed-function oxidase activity in the same manner shownto be the case for parathion; with respect to median lethal doses, parathionand disulfoton are similar (Stevens et al. 1973). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL for disulfoton of 0.1 mg/m\3\.

The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is reported to be 4.1 g/kg, and an acute inhalationstudy showed no ill effects from a single 7-hour exposure at 351 ppm. However,repeated or prolonged contact with the liquid may cause skin burns (DowChemical Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 228). Industrial experience indicates that mild irritation of the respiratorysystem, skin, and eyes can result from inhalation exposures, but thereare no data concerning chronic exposures in humans.

Technical endosulfanis a tan, semi-waxy solid mixture; it may have a slight odor similar tothat of sulfur dioxide. The insecticide, endosulfan, is similar in its acute oral toxicity to therelated insecticides aldrin and dieldrin, with the exception that it isslightly more toxic than these substances in female laboratory animals.In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> of endosulfan is 43 mg/kg for males and 18 mg/kg for females(Farm Chemicals Handbook 1974). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2>s in male and female rats are 130 mg/kg and 74 mg/kg, respectively(Farm Chemicals Handbook 1974). The respiratory LC<T2>50</T2> for male rats is 50 mg/kg for 4 hours of exposure (PesticideChemicals Official Copendium, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 230). In laboratory tests of chronic exposure, rats tolerated oral doses of upto 3.2 mg/kg/day for 3 months without injury (Gaines, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 230), and dogs tolerated doses up to 0.75 mg/kg for 1 year (Ely,MacFarlane, Galen, and Hines 1967). A 2-year dietary level of 10 ppm (approximately0.5 mg/kg/day) in rats was associated with a statistically insignificantdecline in female survival rates and caused a reduction in testis weightsin males. At 5.0 mg/kg/day, histopathologic findings showed renal tubulardamage and some hydropic changes in rat livers (Czech 1958). Inhalation of endosulfan dust has been associated with slight nausea, confusion,excitement, flushing, and dry mouth (State of California: Department ofIndustrial Relations, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 230). Nine employees whohad been working with 50-percent water-wettable endosulfan powder for onlya few days had convulsions (Pesticide Chemicals Official Compendium, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 230). OSHA preliminarily concludes that exposure to endosulfan poses a risk ofsystemic poisoning and renal and testicular damage, and the Agency thereforeproposes a PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA for endosulfan. OSHA believes that thislimit will substantially reduce the risk currently associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor endosulfan.

For female rats, an averageoral LD<T2>50</T2> of 3 mg/kg has been reported (NIOSH 1974). The acute dermalLD<T2>50</T2>s reported for rats and guinea pigs are 147 and 278 mg/kg, respectively(Weir and Hazleton 1981). Weir and Hazleton reported that no localizedeye irritation occurred when 0.1 ml of technical fonofos was instilledinto rabbit eyes; however, death resulted in these animals within 24 hoursafter the instillation (1981). Dietary studies of rats lasting 105 weekshave shown 10 ppm (about 0.2 mg/kg) to be a no-effect level. Dogs fed fonofosfor 14 weeks showed no-effect dietary levels of 8 ppm; no carcinogeniceffects were observed. Rats showed reproductive effects at dietary levelsof 10 ppm and 31.6 ppm (about 0.7 mg/kg) (Stauffer Chemical Co., as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 275). There are no reports of human poisonings caused by fonofos, although itis known to be a cholinesterase inhibitor (ACGIH 1986, p. 275). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA for fonofos to protect exposedworkers from the risk of cholinesterase inhibition that is characteristicof this substance and of other organic phosphate pesticides. A skin notationis also proposed, based on evidence in animals that fonofos can penetratethe skin and cause death.

Dietary administration at 1.5 g/kg for 2 weeks resulted in fatalitiesin rats; pathologic examination revealed cumulative changes characteristicof gastritis and malnutrition (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 278). Czajkowska (1981) reports the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for skin absorption in rabbits as 6 g/kg; Sturla and Krauss(1977) report the approximate lethal dose in rabbits to be greater than17 g/kg. Mild and transient irritation, but no allergic skin sensitization,occurred when formamide was applied to the skin of guinea pigs (Sax 1984;E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 278). However,the potential for systemic toxicity through skin absorption has been demonstratedin tests with rats, although effective doses were relatively high (BASFCorporation 1985, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 278). Eye irritation testsin rabbits showed only slight, temporary irritation (Carpenter and Smyth1956). No signs of toxicity in rats were detected in single 6-hour exposuresat 3900 ppm formamide dispensed as a mist, or in 6-hour daily exposuresfor 10 days at approximately 1500 ppm formamide vapor (equivalent to airsaturated with formamide at room temperature); no indications of organdamage were seen in these animals on pathologic examination (E.I. du Pontde Nemours and Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 278). Gross fetal malformations were not noted following dermal applicationsof formamide to skin of pregnant rats; the effects that were observed wereweak and were produced at overwhelming concentrations (Stula and Krauss1977). The no-observed-effect level in a rabbit developmental toxicitystudy was 22 mg/kg orally (Merkle and Zeller 1980). There are no reports of industrial poisoning by formamide (E.I. du Pontde Nemours and Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 278). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 20 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 30 ppm forformamide. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combined limitwill protect workers against the risk of eye and skin irritation that existspotentially from workplace exposure at the levels permitted by the absenceof any OSHA limit.

An early study indicated that germanium tetrahydride has a toxicity betweenthat of tin hydride and arsine (Flury and Zernik 1931). In this study,a rabbit survived exposure to 100 ppm for 1 hour. One-hour exposures at150 and 185 ppm caused fatalities in mice, and a similar exposure involvingguinea pigs resulted in sickness at the 150 ppm level and death at 185ppm (Flury and Zernik 1931). On the other hand, Webster (1956) reportedthat germanium tetrahydride is less toxic than both tin hydride and arsine.The effect of exposure to germanium tetrahydride is hemolysis. Data concerningchronic or sub-acute toxicities are not available. Based on germanium'sacute toxicity, which is approximately half that of stibine, the ACGIHrecommends an 8-hour TLV of 0.2 ppm TWA. OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for germanium tetrahydrideto reduce the risk of hemolytic effects associated with exposure to thissubstance at the previous uncontrolled level. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that implementation of this limit will substantially reduce thisrisk.

No. 1212</ITAG>OSHA has no current limit for indene. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of10 ppm for this colorless liquid. This limit is recommended by analogyto naphthalene, for which a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm is recommended. Early inhalation studies of indene reported injury to the spleen, liver,and kidneys of rats exposed to indene vapor concentrations of 800 to 900ppm for six 7-hour periods (Cameron and Doniger 1939). Some animals werefound at necropsy to have severe necrosis of the liver with hemorrhage;kidney necrosis was also observed. No other organ damage was found andno deaths occurred as a result of these exposures (Cameron and Doniger1939). By analogy with the effects of exposure to other monoaromatic hydrocarbons,exposure to indene is likely to irritate the mucous membranes. In laboratoryanimals, chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage have resultedfrom the aspiration of indene liquid into the lung, and repeated skin contacthas caused dermatitis as a result of the defatting properties of indene(Gerarde 1960). In dermal studies of rats, one to eight applications of0.1 ml to the shaved skin were reported to have no effect; three applicationsof 0.5 ml to guinea pig skin also produced no effect (Cameron and Doniger1939). The oral toxicity of indene appears to be moderate, with adult rabbitstolerating a single dose of 1 gram without signs of systemic toxicity (Gerarde1960). Subcutaneous injection of 1 gram, however, caused liver pathologyand fatalities; high oral doses (2.5 ml of a 1:1 v/v mixture in olive oil)were uniformly fatal, with characteristic liver, lung, and gastrointestinalchanges. Chronic administration of 3 mg/m\3\ indene for 105 days causedcatalase inhibition and stimulation of blood cholinesterase in rats, butno effects were observed in rats exposed at 0.6 mg/m\3\ (Dyshinevich, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 321). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 10 ppm TWA for indene. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this level will reduce the risk of irritation, pulmonaryeffects, and systemic toxicity that may occur when workers are exposedto indene at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA permissibleexposure limit.

OSHA is proposing to reduce the current 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppm to 50ppm for isobutyl alcohol. The Agency preliminarily concludes that a 50-ppmlimit will reduce the risk of skin irritation associated with exposuresto concentrations below those permitted by the current OSHA PEL. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for isobutylalcohol if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ISOOCTYL ALCOHOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 26952-21-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>3</T2>CH(C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Slight irritation of the skin and eyes has been reported in animalsas a result of direct contact with this chemical (Dow Chemical Company,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 338). No other data concerning chronic toxicityor human exposure are available (ACGIH 1986, p. 338). Chemical analysis shows n-isopropylaniline to have toxicologic propertiessimilar to those of its parent compound, aniline. The oral LD<T2>50</T2>s for the two chemicals are approximately equal. The ACGIH hasestablished the 2-ppm TLV-TWA for n-isopropylaniline on the basis of structuralanalogy with aniline (which has a 2-ppm TLV-TWA) and n,n-dimethylaniline(which has a 5-ppm TLV-TWA and a 10-ppm STEL); exposure to these substanceshas been shown to cause hemolytic and central nervous system effects inanimals and humans. These substances are also toxic when absorbed throughthe skin. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour PEL of 2 ppm for n-isopropylaniline, with askin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willprotect exposed workers from the risk of irritation and, by analogy withaniline, of systemic and hemolytic effects caused by inhalation, ingestion,or dermal absorption.

Ketene is highly irritating to the respiratory tract (Mendenhall and Stokinger1959), and the effects of its action are delayed (Treon, Sigmon, Kitzmilleret al. 1949). Mendenhall and Stokinger (1959) have reported a 10-minuteLC<T2>50</T2> for mice of 17 ppm. Chronic exposure at 1 ppm for 6 monthson a schedule of 6 hours daily, 5 days per week, was tolerated by animalsof several species (Mendenhall and Stokinger 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 341). Similar results have been reported in monkeys exposed repeatedly(55 exposures) for 7 hours (Treon, Sigmon, Kitzmiller et al. 1949). Evidencestrongly suggests that the development of emphysema and fibrosis may occurin individuals who have developed a tolerance to the acute effects of keteneexposure (Stokinger, Wagner, and Dobrogarski 1957). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.5 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 1.5ppm for ketene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that workers exposedto this highly irritating and toxic gas are at risk of developing respiratoryirritation, pulmonary edema, and other severe pulmonary effects.

In rabbits, the skin absorption LD<T2>50 </T2>for methacrylic acid is 0.5 to 1 g/kg (Dow Chemical Company,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 362). Rats exposed by inhalation to approximately1000 ppm methacrylic acid exhibited eye irritation (Dow Chemical Company,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 362). Rats exposed to 300 ppm for 6 hours dailyfor 20 days showed slight congestion of the kidneys (Gage 1970). Medical reports of acute exposures (at concentrations of up to 113 ppm)in an industrial setting revealed no respiratory symptoms; however, skinresponses and a severe corneal burn were reported (Dow Chemical Company,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 362). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 20 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for this substance.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the risk of severe eye and skin irritation potentially associatedwith exposure to methacrylic acid at the levels permitted by the absenceof any OSHA limit.

Methyl demeton is reported to have an oral LD<T2>50</T2> value of 40 to 65 mg/kg for the thiolo isomer and 150 to 250mg/kg for the thiono isomer. Both isomers form sulfoxide or sulfone, withan oral LD<T2>50</T2> similar to that of the parent compounds (Dubois and Plazak1962; Heath and Vandekar 1965; Klimmer and Plaff 1955). In solution orstorage, methyl demeton may form alkyl sulfonium compounds of very highintravenous toxicity and an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 10 to 20 mg/kg. Dermal toxicity is reported to be moderate,with an LD<T2>50</T2> of approximately 400 mg/kg (Heath and Vandekar 1965). In humans, methyl demeton causes changes in intraocular pressure, and acutepoisonings produce nausea, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and hyperemiaof the nasal mucosa.

Thesame authors report that MEKP is irritating to the eyes and skin. In addition,the effects of MEKP exposure are cumulative; rats died or showed markedevidence of cumulative effects both orally and intraperitoneally after7 weeks of 3-day/week doses of MEKP that were 20 percent of the LD<T2>50</T2> level (Floyd and Stokinger 1958). Inhalation of vapors producedpetechial and gross hemorrhages of the lungs in rats after 4-hour exposures;liver and kidney damage was also observed by these authors. Acute high-levelexposures have caused nasal porphyrin exudate in rats.

Methyl formate is a flammable, colorless liquid with an agreeableodor.Methyl formate causes nose and eye irritation, vomiting, incoordination,narcosis, and death in guinea pigs exposed at high concentrations (Schrenk,Yant, Chornyak, and Patty 1936). A 5-percent concentration was fatal in20 to 30 minutes, a 1.5- to 2.5-percent concentration was dangerous in30 to 60 minutes, and a 0.5-percent concentration (5000 ppm) was consideredthe maximum concentration tolerable for a 60-minute period without seriousconsequences. Lehmann and Flury (1943) observed that inhalation of 1.02percent methyl formate for 2 to 3 hours caused pulmonary edema and deathin cats; a concentration of 1600 ppm resulted in lung inflammation after1 hour (1943). Guinea pigs died when exposed by inhalation to 2.5 percentmethyl formate (Lehmann and Flury 1943). In studies of methyl formate exposure in humans, van Oettingen reportedthat exposed workers showed temporary blindness, narcosis, mucous membraneirritation, and dyspnea (1959). Fairhall (1957) has reported that methylformate was more irritating than either methyl or ethyl acetate (1957).OSHA is proposing both a 15-minute STEL of 150 ppm and an 8-hour PEL of100 ppm TWA to prevent the risks of irritation, narcotic effects, and pulmonarydamage potentially associated with exposure to concentrations of methylformate even for short periods (one hour or more).

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA limit of 2 ppm, with a skin notation,for methyl iodide, and classifies it as a suspected human carcinogen (A2).NIOSH recommends reducing exposure to the lowest feasible limit, and alsoconsiders this chemical a carcinogen. Methyl iodide is a colorless, sweet-smellingliquid that turns yellow, red, or brown when exposed to light and moisture.Methyl iodide has been reported to have an LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 150 to 200 mg/kg; liver damage was evident afterthese lethal exposures (Kutob and Plaa 1960). Fifteen-minute exposuresto 3800 ppm were fatal in rats (Chambers et al. 1950, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 399), and Bachem (1927, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 399) has reportedthat methyl iodide is 6 times as toxic in mice as methyl bromide. Inhalationstudies have shown eye irritation and depressed body weight in rats asa result of 14-week exposures to 30 and 60 ppm (Black et al. 1984). Thesame authors observed fatalities in rats within 4 weeks of exposure to143 ppm; 10 ppm was reported to be a no-effect level. In industry, fatalities have occurred from methyl iodide poisoning in chemicalworkers (Garland and Camps 1945; Appel, Galen, O'Brien, and Schoenfeldt1975). The exposure levels associated with these fatal overexposures arenot known, however (ACGIH 1986, p. 399). In tests of carcinogenicity, methyl iodide produced local sarcomas in ratsinjected subcutaneously and lung tumors in mice given intraperitoneal injections(Druckrey, Kruse, Preussman et al. 1970; Poirer, Stoner, and Shimkin 1975).These carcinogenic effects occurred at a dosage approximately equivalentto a daily 8-hour exposure to 20 or 25 ppm for an adult human (ACGIH 1986,p. 399).

The oral LD<T2>50</T2> value of methyl isoamyl ketone in rats is 1.67 g/kg (Smythet al. 1962). No data relating exposure levels to specific effects in humanshave been reported. However, the ACGIH (1986, p. 400) believes that MIAKis likely to be more irritating and a more potent narcotic than is thecase for methyl isobutyl ketone. The NIOSH criteria document on the ketones states that ``because methylisoamyl ketone contains one more carbon atom than does methyl isobutylketone, methyl (isoamyl) ketone might produce irritation and narcosis atconcentrations at least as low as those at which methyl isobutyl ketoneproduces these effects,'' and NIOSH thus recommends a 50-ppm TWA for MIAK,corresponding to NIOSH's recommendation for methyl isobutyl ketone (NIOSH1978). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 50 ppm for methyl isoamyl ketone.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the risk of narcotic and irritant effects potentially associatedwith exposure to MIAK at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHAlimit.

Methyl parathion is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and excessive exposurecan cause sweating, salivation, diarrhea, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction,muscle fasciculations, and coma. Methyl parathion's acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male rats is almost identical to that of parathion, i.e.,10 to 25 mg/kg; for female rats, the LD<T2>50</T2> is 24 mg/kg, or approximately one-sixth that of parathion.By the dermal route, methyl parathion is much less toxic than parathion,with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 67 mg/kg in rats of both sexes (Hayes, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 407). Erythrocyte cholinesterase activity was inhibited in dogsfed methyl parathion for 12 weeks at a rate corresponding to approximately24 mg/day; inhibition of both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activityoccurred at doses of 70 mg/day, without accompanying illness (Williamset al. 1959). Dogs fed 6 mg/day methyl parathion for 12 weeks showed noeffects from such exposures (Williams et al.). Lifetime feeding studiesof rats and mice fed diets containing methyl parathion concentrations ofup to 40 ppm and up to 125 ppm, respectively, produced no evidence of cancer(NCI 1979). Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels did not differ by more than20 percent in subjects exposed at 7, 7.5, 8, or 9 mg/man/day, comparedwith controls (Moeller and Rider 1963). Tiess and associates (1982) havereported a case of protracted methyl parathion poisoning resulting fromboth percutaneous and inhalation exposure; Dille and Smith (1964) attributethe long-term neuro-psychiatric illness of two pilots to exposure to methylparathion and other cholinesterase-inhibiting agents. Chronic exposureto small doses of methyl parathion have not caused chromosomal effects(DeCassia Stocco et al. 1982).

The single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 23 or 39 mg/kg, depending on sex. The skin LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 1692andplusmin;145 mg/kg, and the 1-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> for rats is about 350 mg/m\3\ (The Ethyl Corporation, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 387). Toxic exposures by all routes produce rapidly appearingsymptoms of mild excitement, hyperactivity, tremors, severe clonic spasms,weakness, respiratory distress, and occasional clonic convulsions, followedby terminal coma (U.S. Navy Smoke Abatement Additive, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 387). Acute exposure causes damage to the liver, kidneys, and cerebral cortex,as well as changes in lung tissue (ACGIH 1986, p. 387). Browning (1966)observed chronic bronchitis, peribronchitis, interstitial pneumonia, andlung abscesses in animals that subsequently died from long-term inhalationexposure to C1-2: exposure to C1-2 concentrations of approximately 12 mg/m\3\for 100 days produced no deviation in weight gain patterns and no grossor microscopic changes in two dogs (Browning 1966). The liver and kidneysare the principal target organs associated with acute overexposures; thelungs of overexposed animals were hemorrhagic (Browning 1966). In humans, skin contact should be entirely avoided. A 5- to 15-ml spillon one worker's hand and wrist was reported to have caused ``thick tongue,''nausea, giddiness, and headache within 3 to 5 minutes (U.S. Navy SmokeAbatement Additive, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 387).OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ TWA as manganese, with a skin notation,for 2-methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect workers against the risk of CNSeffects and systemic damage that exists in the absence of any OSHA limitfor this substance. A skin notation is proposed because of C1-2's abilityto penetrate the skin rapidly. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for manganese. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MONOCROTOPHOS (AZODRIN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 6923-22-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>14</T2>NO<T2>5</T2>P </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1279</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for the systemic insecticide monocrotophos.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.25 mg/m\3\ for this reddish-brown solidwith a mild ester odor. Monocrotophos is a highly toxic, direct acting cholinesterase inhibitorthat penetrates the intact skin (ACGIH 1986, p. 416). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> values in rats and mice range from 5.7 to 17 mg/kg in a waterformulation (Brown et al. 1970; Shellenberger and Newell, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 416) and from 10 to 23 mg/kg in an oil formulation (Shellenbergerand Newell, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416). These authors also reporta percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in the rabbit that ranges from 112 to 709 mg/kg, dependingon the vehicle used. A 2-year dietary study of rats ingesting 0, 1, 10,or 100 ppm monocrotophos revealed that both sexes in the 100 ppm groupfailed to gain as much weight as the controls, but autopsy showed no significantfindings; plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinesterase decreased at thetwo highest dose levels but were unaffected at 1 ppm (Johnston 1966, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416; Johnston et al. 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 416). Another 2-year feeding study in dogs administered doses of upto 16 ppm monocrotophos revealed no adverse effects at levels of 0.16 and1.6 ppm, but serious cholinesterase reduction was observed at the 16 ppmlevel (Johnston 1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416; Johnston et al. 1967,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416). Metabolism studies in rats and goats indicatethat monocrotophos is excreted rapidly in the rat and does not accumulatein the body (Bull and Lindquist, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416); goatsgiven labeled monocrotophos by mouth showed only traces of the materialin their milk (Menzer and Casida; Potter, both as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 416). Inhalation exposure of rats to an unknown concentration of 75percent monocrotophos in air for 1 hour was not lethal; a 4-hour exposureto an unknown concentration of the aerosol (0.4 and 0.75 percent) was fatalto 2 out of 6 (0.4 percent aerosol) and 5 out of 8 rats (0.75 percent aerosol).Head-only exposure to the 0.4 percent aerosol resulted in the death ofone of eight animals (Wilson, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416). Intravenous injection of radiolabeled monocrotophos in human volunteersshowed maximum excretion at 4 to 8 hours, with 67 andplusmin; 5 percent ofthe material in the urine; absorption of 14 andplusmin; 7 percent occurredwhen the radiolabeled material was applied to the forearm; 33 andplusmin;9 percent of the applied dose was absorbed when it was covered with a vapor-prooffilm for 72 hours (Maibach 1970). Although gauze patches attached to theclothing and skin of field workers attested to the presence of monocrotophos,no cholinesterase inhibition resulted in post-exposure examinations at3 hours and at 3 and 7 days (Maibach, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 416).OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.25 mg/m\3\ TWA for monocrotophos. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against therisk of cholinesterase inhibition potentially associated with exposurein the workplace at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor monocrotophos. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MORPHOLINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-91-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>NO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1281</ITAG>OSHA has a current limit of 20 ppm, with a skin notation, for morpholine.The ACGIH recommends a 20-ppm TWA limit and a TLV-STEL of 30 ppm, as wellas a skin notation. Morpholine is a colorless liquid with an amine-likeodor. Exposure to morpholine produces nasal and bronchial irritation and liverand kidney impairment in animals (Shea 1939); the substance readily penetratesthe skin and is highly irritating to the eyes (Jefferson Chemical Company,Inc. 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 417). The single oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 1.05 g/kg (range: 0.95 to 1.16 g/kg), and the singleskin LD<T2>50</T2> for 24-hour contact is 0.5 mg/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, andPozzani 1954). A 1-hour exposure to concentrated vapor was not fatal inrats, nor was an 8-hour exposure to 8000 ppm (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, andPozzani 1954). Rats were exposed for 8 hours daily to a concentration of18,000 ppm for a total of 5 days; after the first day, all animals showedseverely reddened thoracic walls, and one fatality (from kidney and livercongestion) occurred. A similar fatality occurred on the third day; onday 4, a third rat died, and postmortem examination revealed degenerationof the epithelial lining of the kidney tubules. Three additional deathsoccurred after the exposures had ended; autopsy revealed thickened alveoli,emphysema, and liver and kidney effects (Shea 1939). Reporting on his own reactions to morpholine exposure at a concentrationof 12,000 ppm, Shea (1939) complained of nose irritation (after 1 minute)and coughing (after 90 seconds); in addition, when he transferred morpholineby pipette, he experienced sore throat and mucosal irritation. All symptomsdisappeared after the experiment stopped (Shea 1939). Skin contact posesa moderately high degree of hazard, which diminishes as the product isdiluted with water to less than 25 percent (Jefferson Chemical Company,Inc. 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 417). Respiratory irritation butno chronic effects have been reported as a result of industrial exposure(Patty 1963). In comparison with ammonia, morpholine has a greater potentialfor systemic toxicity (ACGIH 1986, p. 417). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit for morpholine of 20 ppm TWA and a 15-minuteSTEL of 30 ppm, with a skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat this limit will protect workers against the risk of eye and respiratorytract irritation potentially associated with exposures in the absence ofa short-term limit. OSHA is retaining the skin notation for morpholinebecause of its ability to be absorbed through the skin. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for morpholineif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">NITRIC ACID </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7697-37-2; Chemical Formula: HNO<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Nitric acid is a fuming colorless or yellowishliquid. Rats receiving a single exposure to nitric acid mist at a concentrationof 63 mg/m\3\ exhibited no apparent adverse effects (Diggle and Gage 1954).Chronic exposure to airborne nitric acid vapor or mist at unspecified levelswas reported to cause chronic bronchitis, pneumonitis (Fairhall 1957),and tooth erosion (Lynch and Bell 1947). Nitric acid's irritant potential is considered similar to that of otherstrong acids; it typically exists in conjuction with nitrogen dioxide,which is regarded as being more hazardous (ACGIH 1986, p. 428). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 2 ppm TWA and a STEL of 4 ppm for nitric acid.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this combined limit will protectworkers against the risk of irritation, chronic pulmonary disease, anddental corrosion that potentially exists at exposures at the levels permittedby the TWA alone. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level.

The ACGIH recommends a limit of TLV-TWA 3 mg/m\3\,with a skin notation. para-Nitroaniline usually exists in the form of yellowneedles. p-Nitroaniline is readily absorbed through the skin and is a strong methemoglobin-formingagent, and prolonged exposure can cause liver damage (ACGIH 1986, p. 430).Anderson (1946) reported several cases of PNA-poisoning among shipboardworkers assigned to clean up a p-nitroaniline spill; one man with a historyof liver disease became jaundiced and died, and the other exposed workersbecame cyanotic and complained of headache, sleepiness, weakness, and respiratorydistress (Anderson 1946). It has also been reported that children who ingestedp-nitroaniline that was contained in wax crayons subsequently became ill(Rieders and Brieger 1953). Several investigators (Anderson 1946; Gupta 1953; Fairhall 1957; Linch1974) have concluded that the nitroanilines are more hazardous than aniline,and, on this basis, the ACGIH has recommended a TWA limit for PNA thatis lower than the limit for aniline (ACGIH 1986, p. 430). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 3 mg/m\3\ TWA for p-nitroaniline, with a skinnotation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the risk of methemoglobinemia and liver damage potentiallyassociated with exposure to PNA at levels above 3 mg/m\3\.

The ortho- and meta-isomers of nitrotoluene are yellow liquids;the para-isomer is also yellow, but exists in crystalline form. Nitrotoluene is one of the aromatic nitrogen compounds that may cause methemoglobinformation. Linch (1974) has studied the nitrotoluene isomers and reportedthat they have relatively low emiagenic potential; he considered nitrotoluenecomparable to aniline in its toxic effects (Linch 1974). Cases of poisoningas a result of exposure to nitrotoluene are rare (von Oettingen 1941).OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, for nitrotoluene.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the risk of methemoglobinemia potentially associated with exposureto this substance; the skin notation is retained because of nitrotoluene'scapacity to penetrate the skin.

Anhydrousoxalic acid is usually in the form of a white powder; the dihydrate formis a colorless, odorless, crystalline substance. Oxalic acid is known to produce severe burns of the eyes, mucous membranes,and skin (The Merck Index 1983, p. 991). There have been human fatalitiesfrom ingesting as little as 5 grams of oxalic acid. It appears that thesedeaths were caused by oxalic acid's ability to disturb the calcium-potassiumbalance in critical tissues (Klauder, Shelanski, and Gabriel 1955). Solutionsof 5- to 10 percent oxalic acid have also been reported to irritate theskin on prolonged exposure. Because of oxalic acid's severe acute toxicity, OSHA is proposing an 8-hourTWA limit of 1 mg/m\3\ PEL and a STEL of 2 mg/m\3\.

The 4-hour LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats and mice were 385 and 630 ppm, respectively. Dogsexposed for 4 hours to 220- to 450-ppm concentrations of the vapor, followedby exposure to 620 ppm for 2.5 hours, became hyperpneic and cyanotic andshowed increased methemoglobin. Dogs succumbing from these exposures hadpigment deposition in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; alveolar hemorrhageand collapse; and emphysema. Exposure to 185 ppm for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 7 weeks killed 18of 20 rats, 20 of 30 mice, and all exposed guinea pigs (Greene, Colburn,Donati, and Weeks 1960). These animals had difficulty breathing, becamecyanotic, and developed alveolar edema and methemoglobinemia; at autopsy,they showed fluorosis; patchy lungs; enlarged spleens; and hemosiderosisof the kidneys, spleen, and liver. When animals were exposed on a similarregimen but to a concentration of 104 ppm for 6 weeks, all guinea pigsbut only 1 of 20 rats died (Greene, Colbourn, Donati, and Weeks 1960).After a 6-month exposure to 24 ppm, bone fluoride levels increased 4-foldin guinea pigs, 3-fold in rats, and about 50 percent in dogs.

The commercial product is a mixture ofcis- and trans-isomers that have a yellow color. The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of phosdrin is 4 to 8 mg/kg for male mice and 6 to 8 mg/kgfor female rats (Shell Chemical Corporation 1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986,p. 412). Phosdrin is a cholinesterase inhibitor and has been reported tocause slight plasma cholinesterase depression but no decrease in braincholinesterase activity in rats fed 2 to 5 ppm. The compound may be absorbeddermally and by inhalation or ingestion; the action of the compound isdirect and immediate (Cleveland and Treon 1961). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rats has been reported to be 4.5 mg/kg (Gaines 1969). Chronicfeeding of rats demonstrated a minimal lethal dose of between 100 and 200ppm. Cholinesterase activity decreased continually when sublethal doseswere administered until a maximum reduction in RBC cholinesterase activityof 25 percent was achieved on the 27th day of the administration of 1.5to 20 mg doses (Huelse and Federspil 1975). In industry, the primary hazards associated with exposure to phosdrin areabsorption of phosdrin through the skin, lung, and mucous membranes, whichcauses liver damage (Natoff 1970). Phosdrin intoxication is reported tooccur in humans, with accompanying symptoms of headache, visual distortion,weakness, cramps, diarrhea, pain, and respiratory distress. Severe exposuremay cause convulsions; in one reported case, some symptoms (anxiety, depression,vertigo, and nystagmus) persisted for as long as 4 months (Zavon, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 412).

The primary hazards associated with inhalation of phosphorus oxychloridevapor are irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, as well as narcoticeffects, gastric irritation, pulmonary edema, and nephritis (The InternationalTechnical Information Institute 1978). Weeks and associates (1964) reported 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> values for phosphorus oxychloride of 48 ppm and 52 ppm forguinea pigs and rats, respectively.

The substance can also produce skinand, perhaps, pulmonary sensitization (Patty 1963). Baader (1955) has reportedirritant effects in animals exposed to 30 mg/m\3\ (approximately 5 ppm)phthalic anhydride in air. In studies of workers exposed to phthalic anhydride, symptoms of respiratorytract injury as well as bronchitis, eye irritation, and nasal bleedinghave been reported. Precise exposure concentrations were not detectableby the analytic method being used, which had a limit of detection of 25mg/m\3\ (i.e., of 4 ppm or lower) (Baader 1955; Menschick 1955). Otherindustrial acid anhydrides (e.g., tetrachlorphthalic anhydride and maleicanhydride) are considered more irritating than phthalic anhydride (ACGIH1986, p. 489). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm for phthalic anhydride,compared with the limit of 0.25 ppm being proposed for maleic anhydride.The Agency preliminarily concludes that a 1 ppm limit will reduce the riskof respiratory irritation and the potential risk of skin and pulmonarysensitization that exists for workers exposed at higher levels permittedby the current PEL.

Propargyl alcohol is a primary skin irritant, but it is not a skin sensitizer(Antara Chemicals 1952, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 496).

The ACGIH limit is basedon the structural and toxicological similarity of propargyl alcohol toallyl alcohol (ACGIH 1986, p. 496). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA for propargyl alcohol of 1 ppm, with askin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits willprotect workers against the risk of skin and mucous membrane irritationpotentially associated with exposure to this substance at the levels permittedin the absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for propargyl alcohol. At the time of thefinal rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines thatthis limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PROPIONIC ACID </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-09-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>COOH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1336</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for propionic acid. The ACGIH recommends aTLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 15 ppm. Propionic acid is a colorless,oily liquid with a pungent odor. The primary health effects associated with exposure to propionic acid areskin burns and irritation of the eyes and respiratory system. Smyth andco-workers (1962) reported that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 4.3 g/kg; NIOSH (1977) stated that the intravenousLD<T2>50</T2> for mice is 625 mg/kg and the skin absorption LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 500 mg/kg. Inhalation of the saturated vaporfor 8 hours caused no rat fatalities (ACGIH 1986, p. 498). Acute industrial exposures have been reported to cause mild to moderateskin burns, eye irritation, and, in a single incident, asthmatic cough.No irritation was observed as a consequence of exposures in humans averagingbelow 0.25 ppm with excursions to 2.1 ppm in an 8 hour-period (Dow ChemicalCompany, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 498). OSHA proposes limits of 10 ppm TWA and 15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL for propionicacid. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of these limits arerequired to protect workers against the risk of eye and respiratory tractirritation that exists at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHAlimit.

The primary health effects associated with exposure to n-propyl acetateare narcosis and eye and respiratory irritation. The limiting 5-hour narcoticconcentrations for cats and mice have been reported as 9000 ppm and 6000ppm, respectively (Flury and Wirth 1933). n-Propyl acetate's narcotic actionis 1.3 times that of ethyl acetate; salivation and irritation of cats'eyes occurred at 2600 ppm (Flury and Wirth 1933). A 4-hour exposure at8000 ppm killed four of six rats (Smyth 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p.500). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 200 ppm TWA and a STEL of 250 ppm for n-propylacetate. The Agency preliminarily concludes that both of these limits arerequired to prevent the risk of narcosis and eye and respiratory tractirritation that exists for workers exposed to levels above the level permittedby the 8-hour TWA limit alone. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level.

The ACGIHrecommends the same TWA limit, a 250-ppm 15-minute STEL, and a skin notation.Propyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with an alcohol-like odor. The primary health effect associated with exposure to propyl alcohol ismild narcosis. Propyl alcohol's toxicity is somewhat greater than thatof isopropyl alcohol (Gleason, Gosselin, and Hodge 1963). The inhalation LD<T2>50</T2> for propyl alcohol in rats is reported as 1.9 g/kg (Smyth,Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954). Starrek reported deep narcosis in miceinhaling the vapor at a concentration of 4100 ppm for 240 minutes and of24,500 ppm for 60 minutes; ataxia appeared in 90 to 120 minutes at 3250ppm (Starrek in Patty 1963, pp. 1434-1438). These effects are almost twiceas intense as those reported for exposure to the vapor of isopropyl alcohol.The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 5040 mg/kg (Sax 1984). Nelson, Ege, Ross, and associates (1943) reported mild eye, nose, and throatirritation in humans exposed at 400 ppm to the vapor of isopropyl alcohol,but no data exist on human sensory response to propyl alcohol vapor. TheACGIH (1986, p. 500) reports that many industrial hygienists consider thevapor of propyl alcohol to be more irritating to the throat than the vaporof the isomer. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm and a STEL of 250 ppm forpropyl alcohol, with a skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat these limits will protect workers against the risk of narcosis andirritation that exists at levels above the PEL.

Propylene oxide is a colorless,highly flammable, volatile, and ethereal liquid. The health hazards associated with exposure to this substance are primaryskin, eye, and respiratory irritation, as well as central nervous systemdepression. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for rats and guinea pigs are 930 mg/kg and690 mg/kg, respectively. In mice, the inhalation LC<T2>50 </T2>has been reported to be at 1740 ppm for 4 hours. Dogs and guineapigs exposed for 4 hours at 2000 and 4000 ppm, respectively, died (NIOSH1977). Although some species tolerate daily exposures to 200 ppm, all speciestested tolerated 100 ppm without ill effects (Rowe, Hollingsworth, Oyenet al. 1956). Jacobson and associates (1956) considered the toxic effectsof propylene oxide to be one-half to one third as intense as those of ethyleneoxide (Jacobson, Hackley, and Feinsilver 1956). Corneal burns and skin necrosis, as well as respiratory and pulmonary irritation,have been reported in humans as a result of direct contact with the liquidor vapor (Patty 1963); central nervous system effects include ataxia, incoordination,and general depression. OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 20 ppm for propylene oxide to protectworkers against the risk of primary irritation and CNS depression potentiallyassociated with exposure to higher levels. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.

Silicon tetrahydride, whichis a colorless gas, is used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Studies of rats exposed to silicon tetrahydride at levels of 126 ppm for1 hour (Matheson Gas Products 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 528) andat 1400 ppm for 6 hours (Union Carbide Corporation 198O, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 528) have failed to identify any systemic effects associated withexposure to this chemical. Sax (1984) lists the effects of acute exposureto silicon tetrahydride as moderate irritation to the eyes, skin, and mucousmembranes. OSHA is proposing a limit of 5 ppm TWA for silicon tetrahydride. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect exposed workers fromthe risk of eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance at the unregulated levels permittedby the absence of any OSHA limit.

Sulfuryl fluoride is a colorless gas with a sulfide odor. When selectingthis limit, the ACGIH took into consideration the fact that, compared withhydrogen fluoride (TLV-TWA ceiling of 3 ppm), only a small portion of theinhaled gas is retained and converted to inorganic fluorides. In extensive animal studies conducted by the Dow Chemical Company (1962and 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 546), sulfuryl fluoride was determinedto exhibit one-half to one-third the acute inhalation toxicity of methylbromide. Acute exposures of animals resulted in tremors that later developedinto severe convulsions. Pulmonary edema was seen in laboratory animalsfollowing a single severe exposure. Repeated exposures of rats, guineapigs, and mice to 20 ppm sulfuryl fluoride for 7 hours per day producedboth kidney and lung injuries after 6 months. After 12 months of exposure,slight effects were seen that reversed after exposure was terminated. Someevidence of fluorosis was observed in the incisors of mice, but not inthe teeth of the rats or guinea pigs (Dow Chemical Company 1962, 1970,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 546).A report by Taxay (1966) that examined an incident of workplace exposureto sulfuryl fluoride noted that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and itchingwere the major symptoms. On the day following exposure, the serum of theaffected worker tested positive for fluoride. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm and a STEL of 10 ppm forsulfuryl fluoride. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limitswill protect workers against the risks of kidney and lung injury and offluorosis potentially associated with chronic exposure to this substance.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level.

No. 1393</ITAG>OSHA's current Z tables have no limits for thionyl chloride. The ACGIHhas established a ceiling limit of 1 ppm for this substance. Thionyl chlorideis a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a suffocating odor. Thionyl chloride vapors are skin, eye, and mucous membrane irritants, probablyas a result of the formation of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride (ACGIH1986, p. 572). An inhalation exposure of 17.5 ppm proved lethal to catswithin 20 minutes (Sax 1979). The ACGIH's exposure limit for thionyl chloride is based on the exposurelimits for the decomposition products (hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide)of thionyl chloride when mixed with water. The reaction of one mole ofthionyl chloride with water produces two moles of hydrogen chloride andone of sulfur dioxide, so that 1 ppm of thionyl chloride can be shown toproduce a total irritant gas concentration of 3 ppm. The exposure limitfor hydrogen chloride is 5 ppm as a ceiling limit; for sulfur dioxide,the limit is a TWA of 2 ppm. Thus, ``the * * * ceiling limit of 1 ppm forthionyl chloride should prevent the irritant effects of its reaction products''(ACGIH 1986, p. 572). The Agency is proposing a ceiling limit of 1 ppm for thionyl chloride.OSHA preliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers fromthe risk of irritation of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance at the levels permitted in theabsence of any OSHA limit.

Tributyl phosphate's toxicity affects the skin and mucous membranes, thelungs and the central nervous system, and this substance is also a cholinesteraseinhibitor. A paper by Smyth and Carpenter (1944) reported that contact with liquidtributyl phosphate caused severe eye injury and skin irritation when testedin rabbits. Chambers and Casida (1967) found that mice injected with 1g/kg tributyl phosphate intraperitoneally became paralyzed. A study byVandekar (1957) in which mice were given tributyl phosphate by gavage revealedthat a dose of 80 mg/kg resulted in a 1-hour period of anesthesia, anda dose of 100 mg/kg resulted in 8 to 10 minutes of anesthesia, followedby respiratory failure and death. Administered intraperitoneally to rats,tributyl phosphate inhibited cholinesterase activity and stimulated plasmabeta-glucuronidase activity (Suzuki, Kikuchi, Kato et al. 1977). This substancedid not exhibit mutagenic activity in bacterial or fruit fly assays (Hannaand Dyer 1975). Nausea and headache were reported by workers exposed tolevels of 15 mg/m\3\ of tributyl phosphate (Mastromatteo, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 591).

One study reportsthat the intravenous LD<T2>50</T2> for this substance is 90 mg/kg in mice (Dechezlepretre andCheymol 1967).

Animal studies have demonstrated that MXDA is strongly irritating to theskin (Haskell Laboratory 1973, private communication; Sherwin-WilliamsCompany 1978). Research at Du Pont (1973) showed that pure MXDA was corrosivewhen applied to the skin of guinea pigs, and a 50-percent MXDA solutioncaused severe irritation in these animals. In a separate study (Sherwin-WilliamsCompany 1978), a 10-percent mixture of MXDA caused severe skin irritationand erythema in guinea pigs. Sherwin-Williams (1978) also reported thatrats exposed to levels of MXDA ranging from 1.74 to 6.04 mg/liter evenfor 1 hour sustained liver, kidney, and lung damage, as determined at necropsy.One study showed mild sensitization when MXDA was applied to guinea pigskin, but this effect was not observed in a second study (Sherwin-WilliamsCompany 1978). OSHA preliminarily concludes that a ceiling limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ is necessaryto protect against the risk of skin irritation, percutaneous absorptionof MXDA, and potential systemic effects.

OSHA is proposing to reduce the existing 8-hour TWA to 2 ppm and to retainthe skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limitswill protect workers from the risk of cardiac, kidney, and liver damagepotentially associated with exposure to this substance. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.

Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofBiochemical/Metabolic Effects </ITAG>Introduction One basis for establishing exposure limits is the ability of many toxicsubstances to interfere with the normal metabolism or biochemistry of thebody. A total of 26 substances for which OSHA is proposing limits fallinto this group. Table C13-1 shows these substances, their current OSHAPELs, ACGIH TLVs, and NIOSH RELs, and their CAS and HS numbers. For fourof these substances, OSHA is proposing only to lower the 8-hour TWA; fortwo other substances, the Agency is proposing to retain the 8-hour limitand to add a STEL. In one instance, OSHA is proposing a reduced TWA andthe addition of a ceiling. In one case (terphenyls), OSHA proposes a reductionin the ceiling level, and for 17 substances, new limits are being proposed.In the case of p-nitrochlorobenzene, OSHA proposes to retain OSHA's currentlimit of 1 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH has a REL for only two of thesesubstances, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Description of the Health Effects The compounds shown in Table C13-1 are further divided into the followingsub-classes, based on their mechanism of action: andbullet; Substances that are cholinesterase inhibitors; andbullet; Substances that interfere with the oxygen carrying capacity ofblood; andbullet; Substances with Antabuse-like effects. The disruption of metabolic processes by toxic substances, if severe enough,results in potentially dangerous effects on the neurological, cardiovascular,and respiratory systems. The adverse health consequences caused by exposureto chemicals having cholinesterase inhibition effects range from wheezing,nausea, vomiting, and confusion to respiratory failure, coma, and death.If exposure has localized rather than systemic effects, the signs and symptomsof cholinesterase inhibition can include sweating, blurred vision, andconstriction of the bronchial tubes. Substances that interfere with theability of the blood to carry oxygen cause a broad range of symptoms, includingfainting, loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat, headache, nausea, coma,and death. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the best known substance in this categoryof chemicals, and exposure to CO is common throughout industry.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 694-697</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>The Antabuse-like effects associated with exposure to three chemicals_disulfiram,cyanamide, and calcium cyanamide_include facial flushing, nausea, and aracing heartbeat. However, these effects are manifested only if the exposedindividual has ingested alcohol. The three chemicals in this sub-groupcause this effect by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, whichis involved in the biotransformation of alcohol. For chemicals that cause systemic toxicity in animals and/or humans, thegrossly observable signs and symptoms of intoxication are usually secondaryto the interaction of the chemical with a molecular target. In other words,the chemical interacts with (binds with or modifies) an endogenous molecularconstituent (protein, nucleic acid, lipid, etc.) in the target tissue(s).The result of the interaction is ordinarily a modification or eliminationof the normal function of the specific molecular constituent which, ifsufficiently severe, may lead to secondary effects within the affectedcells and/or tissues. It is possible for a number of molecules to be affectedby the toxic chemical without there being any overt manifestation of toxicity.In other words, there is an apparent no-effect level governing the overtmanifestation of toxicity, although there are usually metabolic effectsat levels below those that cause overt effects. For chemicals for which the molecular target is known and for which methodsare available to detect the altered molecular target, it is possible touse the measure of altered biochemical function as a sensitive indicatorof exposure to the chemicals at levels below those that cause grossly observablesigns and symptoms of poisoning. For some other classes of chemicals, studiesin animals and/or humans have shed light on the biochemical basis of theirtoxicity. For some of these classes of chemicals, it is possible to baselimits of human exposure on biochemical, metabolic, or pharmacologic indicatorsof their interaction with molecular targets rather than on grossly visiblesigns and symptoms of adverse systemic effects. <T3>Cholinesterase inhibition. </T3>A number of organophosphate and carbamateinsecticides produce acute toxicity in humans through inhibition of acetylcholinesteraseat cholinergic synapses in the central and peripheral nervous systems.This inhibition causes an accumulation of acetylcholine at the effectorsites and elicits signs and symptoms consistent with excessive cholinergicactivity. These include bronchoconstriction; increased bronchial secretions,salivation, and lacrimation; nausea; vomiting; cramps; constriction ofthe pupils; muscular weakness; and cardiac irregularities. If sufficientlysevere, acetyl-cholinesterase inhibition may cause coma, irreversible CNSdamage, and death. The mechanisms by which carbamates and organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterasediffer. In general, carbamates form a non-covalently bound complex withthe enzyme, while most organophosphates bind covalently with the enzyme.The net result, inactivation of the enzyme, is similar for both groups.In either case, the inhibition is usually reversible. The carbamate-cholinesterasecomplex dissociates to regenerate the active enzyme, while cholinesteraseinactivated by organophosphates is replaced by the <T3>de novo </T3>synthesis of active enzyme. Therefore, unless the inhibitionis sufficiently severe to cause brain damage or death, the manifestationsof acute toxicity are reversible, and poisoned individuals recover withoutsequelae. A significant proportion of endogenous cholinesterase activitymay be inhibited before the overt manifestations of intoxication appear.The fraction of total cholinesterase activity that can be inhibited withoutthere being signs and symptoms of toxicity varies from individual to individualand also appears to depend on the intensity and duration of exposure. Thelack of warning signs at low levels of exposure increases the need to setexposure limits at levels that will protect those individuals who do notreadily manifest the symptoms and signs of toxicity from experiencing thesubclinical effects of exposure. <T3>Compounds that interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.</T3>A number of compounds produce their immediate toxicity in humans byaltering the ability of hemoglobin in the red blood cells to bind, transport,and release oxygen. Perhaps the best studied of these is carbon monoxide.Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with a greater affinity than does oxygen.It also alters the dissociation characteristics for the oxygen-hemoglobincomplex. The overall effect is to reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity ofthe blood. Also included in this overall category of compounds is a groupof aromatic amines and nitro compounds that react with hemoglobin in theblood to reduce it to methemoglobin. Methemoglobin will not bind with oxygenand therefore is not an effective carrier of oxygen. Because these compounds reduce the ability of the blood to transport oxygen,the overt signs and symptoms of acute toxicity are those of tissue anoxia,i.e., neurobehavioral disturbances, dizziness, cardiac irregularities,cyanosis, unconsciousness, and death. The severity of the symptoms area function of the degree to which the oxygen-carrying capacity of the bloodhas been depleted and of the state of the exposed individual's health.In the case of carbon monoxide, individuals may experience only very subtleneurobehavioral effects when 10 percent of the hemoglobin is bound to carbonmonoxide, and healthy individuals may tolerate carboxyhemoglobin concentrationsof 50 percent for short periods of time without experiencing lasting adverseeffects. In the cases of both carbon monoxide and the methemoglobin-forming compounds,the primary effect (i.e., formation of carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin)is reversible. In the absence of additional carbon monoxide exposure, carboxyhemoglobindissociates to carbon monoxide and fully functional hemoglobin. Methemoglobincan be reoxidized to hemoglobin by endogenous mechanisms, but the majorrecovery mechanism is via the synthesis of new hemoglobin. <T3>Substances that cause Antabuse-like effects. </T3>The ingestion ofalcoholic beverages following exposure to disulfiram, cyanamide, or calciumcyanamide results in a characteristic syndrome consisting of flushing ofthe face, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and increased heart rate. If exposureis particularly severe, the reaction may trigger convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias,or heart attacks and has in some cases caused death. In the vast majorityof less severe cases, the reaction is fully reversible, although the symptomsare temporarily completely disabling. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is used therapeuticallyin the treatment of chronic alcoholism; as such, employees who are currentlybeing treated with disulfiram for alcoholism are at particularly high riskif they are also occupationally exposed to these substances that causeAntabuse-like effects. These compounds do not cause any signs or symptomsof toxicity in the absence of alcohol ingestion unless exposure levelsare far above those that trigger the alcohol response.Dose-Response Relationships and Biochemical/Metabolic Effects <T3>Cholinesterase inhibition. </T3>Typically, the cholinesterase inhibitionpotential of a compound is assessed by measuring plasma cholinesteraseactivity in the treated organism. Data from experiments in animals andlimited data from human clinical trials indicate that the percentage ofbasal plasma cholinesterase activity decreases with increasing dose andthat the dose-response curve is S-shaped. Because there is inter-individualvariation in this relationship, the dose-response curve for a populationexposed to a cholinesterase inhibitor would be expected to be much shallowerin slope and to have longer tails than the dose-response curve for anysingle individual. The relationship between the dose-response curve for plasma cholinesteraseinhibition and the dose-response curves for more direct indicators of clinicalintoxication, such as acetylcholinesterase activity in the CNS or the actualappearance of signs of intoxication, is not known. Evidence suggests thatthere is considerable inter-individual variability in these relationships.Some individuals may be free of the symptoms and signs of intoxicationwhen their plasma cholinesterase levels have been inhibited by as muchas 90 percent, while others may experience symptoms after only a smalldecrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. Because of this variability,any exposure limit should be set with this individual variability in mind.<T3>Substances that interfere with oxygen transport. </T3>Both carboxyhemoglobinand methemoglobin formation exhibit a classical sigmoidal dose-responserelationship in relation to exposure to carbon monoxide or methemoglob-informingcompounds. The loss in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is a functionof the intensity and duration of exposure. As stated above, the majorityof healthy individuals can tolerate some reduction in the oxygen-carryingcapacity of their blood without experiencing symptoms of overt toxicity.However, there is great inter-individual variability in the degree of decreasedoxygen-carrying capacity that can be tolerated without apparent ill effect.Individuals with pre-existing anemia or with high carboxyhemoglobin levelsas a result of other environmental exposures may already be at or abovethe level at which they will display the signs or experience the symptomsof tissue anoxia. For these individuals, even a small incremental decreasein the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood can have serious consequences.<T3>Substances causing Antabuse-like effects. </T3>The dose-response characteristicsof disulfiram, cyanamide, and calcium cyanamide follow the usual S-shapedcurve. The effect of exposure to cyanamide is approximately one-half thatof exposure to disulfiram (ACGIH 1986). The proposed limits for the substancesin this group have been set at levels below those associated with the Antabuseeffect in workers ingesting alcohol either during or after work. The following paragraphs describe the Agency's preliminary findings withrespect to the substances that cause metabolic disturbances. The discussionsbelow illustrate the serious nature of the risk associated with exposureto these substances.<ITAG tagnum="26">PHORATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 298-02-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>17</T2>O<T2>2</T2>PS<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1319</ITAG>Phorate is an organophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitor that is used asan insecticide. The ACGIH has recommended exposure limits of 0.05 mg/m\3\8-hour TWA and 0.2 mg/m\3\ STEL for phorate, with a skin notation. Phorate has been shown to be a highly toxic compound in animals. Rats exposedto daily doses of phorate showed effects at levels above 0.15 mg/kg/daybut no effects at levels below this level. The no-effect level in dogsis between 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg/day Gaines 1969). The proposed limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, supplemented by aSTEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ and a skin notation, is based on calculations thatthe no-effect level in humans would lie in the range between 0.21 and 0.7mg/day, and that use of an appropriate safety factor would suggest an 8-hourlimit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ with a STEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ to ensure against excursionsgreatly in excess of the TWA limit. OSHA preliminarily finds that these limits will protect workers exposedto phorate against cholinesterase inhibition and its associated effects,which include respiratory symptoms, nausea, confusion, and vomiting. TheAgency believes that, in the absence of any OSHA limit, phorate-exposedemployees are at risk of experiencing such effects and that establishinga PEL will substantially reduce these risks. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for phorate. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CARBON MONOXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 630-08-0; Chemical Formula: CO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1071</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for carbon monoxide is 50 ppm TWA. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 50 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 400 ppm. NIOSH (1972) recommendsan 8-hour TWA limit of 35 ppm with a 200-ppm ceiling.Carbon monoxide readily combines with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin(COHb). Excessive accumulations of COHb cause hypoxic stress in healthyindividuals as a result of reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.In patients with cardiovascular disease, such stress can further impaircardiovascular function. The ACGIH (1986) cites a number of studies showingthat exposure to 50 ppm TWA carbon monoxide generally results in COHb levelsof 8 to 10 percent, and that such levels are not associated with signsor symptoms of health impairment in healthy individuals. However, ACGIHcomments that a TLV of 25 ppm, which results in COHb levels of 4 percentor less, may be necessary for workers with disease that places them athigher risk of serious cardiovascular injury. The NIOSH recommendationof 35 ppm TWA is also based on protecting workers with chronic heart disease;NIOSH believed that such workers should not be allowed to approach a COHblevel of 5 percent. The basis for the recommendation of a 400-ppm TLV-STEL by the ACGIH isnot entirely clear, but may be based on a study by Schulte (1964), whostated that exposure to 100 ppm carbon monoxide for 4 hours is excessive.NIOSH recommended a 200-ppm short-term limit to supplement the TWA limitsince it appears that transient exposures up to 200 ppm do not significantlyalter a worker's equilibrium COHb level. Exposure to the TLV-TWA of 50 ppm generally results in COHb levels of 8to 15 percent. These levels are not associated with toxic effects in healthyindividuals. NIOSH recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 35 ppm and a ceilinglimit of 200 ppm, based on the need to protect workers with chronic heartdisease. OSHA proposes that these NIOSH limits be adopted as the PEL toensure that COHb levels are less than 5 percent and thus protect workerswho may be at greater risk because of cardiovascular or pulmonary impairment.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision tothis level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limitfor carbon monoxide if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk. OSHA's preliminary feasibility analysis is basedon limited data at this level, and the Agency therefore requests additionalfeasibility information from the public.<ITAG tagnum="26">CRUFOMATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 299-86-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>19</T2>ClNO<T2>3</T2>P </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Rats and dogs receiving higher doses (5 mg/kg/day)for two years did show this effect (McCollister et al. 1968). Because cholinesterase inhibition is a very sensitive indicator of exposure,OSHA preliminarily concludes that the proposed level of 5 mg/m\3\ willprovide a margin of safety below the ingestion NOEL for humans, which correspondsapproximately to an 8-hour inhalation of 20 mg/m\3\. The substantial riskof experiencing such effects will be significantly reduced from the uncontrolledlevels possible in the absence of an OSHA limit.

NIOSH recommends a 10-hourTWA limit of 10,000 ppm with a 10-minute 30,000 ppm ceiling limit. Both ACGIH (1986) and NIOSH (1976f) cite studies indicating that continuousexposure to between 1.5 and 3 percent carbon dioxide (15,000 to 30,000ppm) results in few, if any, adverse effects. However, electrolyte imbalancesand other mild metabolic changes have been associated with prolonged exposureto 10,000 to 20,000 ppm (Schulte 1964; Gray et al. 1950). Increases inthe rate of respiration have been observed among resting subjects exposedto 39,500 ppm for periods shorter than a day and among exercising subjectsexposed to airborne concentrations below 30,000 for the same period (Sinclairet al. 1969). OSHA is proposing to add a 30,000-ppm STEL to the existing PEL of 5000ppm TWA to protect employees from experiencing elevated short term exposures;the Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will substantially reducethe risk associated with such short-term exposures to CO<T2>2</T2>.

No. 1025</ITAG>The current OSHA 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit for aniline is 5ppm, with a skin notation. The ACGIH-recommended 8-hour TLV is a 2-ppmTWA, with a skin notation. Aniline, when first distilled, is an oily, colorlessliquid that darkens on exposure to air. Occupational aniline poisoning was a relatively common occurrence in earlieryears (ACGIH 1986, p. 30). The early limits for aniline were set to guardagainst acute toxicity manifested as cyanosis (Henderson and Haggard 1943).Cirrhosis and chronic CNS effects were also reported (Holstein 1955; vonOettingen 1941). Skin absorption occurs when aniline vapor contacts theskin (Dutkiewicz 1962), and skin contact should therefore be avoided.Early studies suggested that less than full-shift exposures of 7 to 53ppm of aniline vapor caused mild symptoms, while 1-hour inhalation exposuresto concentrations in the range of 100 to 160 ppm caused severe effects(Henderson and Haggard 1943). Later studies in several species of animalsfound no effects, other than a slight increase in methemoglobin in theblood of rats, after the animals had been exposed to aniline concentrationsof 5 ppm for 6 months (Oberst, Hackley, and Comstock 1956). An early NCIaniline hydrochloride cancer bioassay in Fischer-344 rats and B6C3F1 micedemonstrated carcinogenic effects, primarily in the spleen of rats, butmultiple organ sites were also involved in rats fed 0.6 percent or 0.3percent aniline hydrochloride for 103 weeks (NCI 1978). OSHA has preliminarily concluded that the current limit of 5 ppm is notprotective, since systemic effects have been observed in humans exposedto levels as low as 7 ppm and in animals at levels as low as 5 ppm. Accordingly,OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA of 2 ppm for aniline and retains the skin notationto protect against percutaneous absorption. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the time ofthe final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for aniline if the Agencydetermines that this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.The Agency intends to analyze the evidence of aniline carcinogenicity further.<ITAG tagnum="26">CALCIUM CYANAMIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 156-62-7; Chemical Formula: CCaN<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The acute toxicity of calcium cyanamide is low, although evidence of itstoxic effects is sparse. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> reported for rabbits is 1400 mg/kg, and that for rats is 1000mg/kg (Guide to Chemicals Used in Crop Production, London, Ontario, 1973).Skin and eye irritation have been reported in rats and rabbits, with asignificant irritative effect occurring when 100 mg is placed directlyinto the eyes of rabbits (Martin 1975). Severe skin irritation developedin rabbits when a paste of this substance was applied to the shaved abdominalskin for 24 hours (Martin 1975). Two of five animals died when the dosewas 10 g/kg, but all survived a dose of 5 g/kg. Most industrial toxicities involve primary skin irritation or sensitizingdermatitis. This skin irritation develops in the form of an erythematousrash over the body surfaces exposed to the substance or those areas irritatedby clothing or perspiration. Some individuals develop a macular rash onexposure, and this may progress to the weeping stage. In addition, exposedworkers may develop temporary vasomotor disturbances of the upper body,with susceptibility increasing with alcohol intake (Fassett 1963). Calciumcyanamide is used medically for its Antabuse-like effect, and the maintenancedose in adults is between 50 and 100 mg/day (Hald, Jacobson, and Varson1952). OSHA proposes a TWA of 0.5 mg/m\3\ for calcium cyanamide. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this level will substantially reduce the risks of eye andskin irritation, sensitizing dermatitis, and the occurrence of Antabuse-likeeffects possible at previously unregulated levels of exposure. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for calciumcyanamide. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limitif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">CARBOFURAN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1563-66-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>15</T2>NO<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Rhesus monkeys did not display cholinesterasedepression at levels equivalent to 0.56 mg/m\3\ of 75-percent wettablepowder (Tobin 1970). Chronic feeding studies in the rat have shown no effectat 25 ppm; in the dog, the no-effect level was 20 ppm (Gaines, unpublisheddata). Inhibition of plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinesterase levelswere evident at levels of 50 ppm in the diet (Tobin 1970). Six-hour exposuresat levels of 0.86 mg/m\3\ caused significant cholinesterase inhibitionin animals (Tobin 1970). Workers exposed at concentrations approaching 0.1 mg/m\3\ have not shownany adverse effects (Tobin, personal communication to ACGIH TLV Committee,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 100).

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 0.2 mg/m\3\ and a 0.6-mg/m\3\ STEL, with a skin notation, for this whitecrystalline solid. Chlorpyrifos has an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 135 mg/kg for female rats and 163 for male rats (The MerckIndex 1983, pp. 309-310). Other sources have reported the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> as 82 mg/kg in rats and the acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2> as about 2000 mg/kg for rabbits (Gray 1965; Gaines 1969). Chlorpyrifos is absorbed through the skin. It is an active inhibitor ofplasma cholinesterase but has only moderate capacity to reduce red bloodcell cholinesterase or to cause cholinergic symptoms and systemic injury(ACGIH 1986, p. 138). Particle inhalation has been shown to cause milddepression in plasma cholinesterase in dogs exposed for 4 hours at theupper end of a 140- to 280-mg/m\3\ range (Spencer 1968). Dogs and rats fed 3.0 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos daily for 2 years showed noadverse effects (FAO/WHO 1972). Male and female rats showed no teratogenicor reproductive effects when fed 1.0 mg/kg per day (Dow Chemical Company1972). Five out of seven human exposures to 0.5 percent chlorpyrifos resultedin a measurable decrease (50 percent) in plasma and red cell cholinesterase(Eliason, Cranmer, von Windeguth et al. 1969). However, another study showedno ill effects on cholinesterase metabolism when human volunteers wereexposed to an ultra-low-volume spray (0.8 um/m\3\ for 3 to 8 minutes) (Ludwig,Kilian, Dishburger, and Edwards 1970). Human cholinesterase levels appearto be less affected by dermal exposure than do those of rabbits (ACGIH1986, p. 138). In human volunteers, four repeated dermal doses of 10 mg/kg,applied for 12 hours each, caused no depression in cholinesterase levels,but a similar dose of 25 mg/kg did depress plasma cholinesterase. Humansubjects ingesting 0.03 mg/kg for 3 weeks showed no cholinesterase effects,but subjects ingesting 0.1 mg/kg demonstrated plasma cholinesterase depression(Dow Chemical Company 1973). Workers applying chlorpyrifos as a spray were exposed to 0.5 percent chlorpyrifosemulsion and exhibited a marked decrease in plasma and red cell cholinesteraselevels (Eliason, Cranmer, von Windeguth et al. 1969). In five of sevenexposed sprayers, this reduction was greater than 50 percent. OSHA proposes a PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ TWA and a 0.6 mg/m\3\ STEL for chlorpyrifosto protect exposed workers against the risk of organic injury and cholinesteraseinhibition caused by this currently unregulated substance. A skin notationis also proposed to protect workers from the significant risk of systemiceffects caused by percutaneous absorption.

Undiluted cyanamide is a deliquescent crystalline solid.The average oral LD<T2>50</T2> for cyanamide in rats is 125 (85 to 180) mg/kg, and cyanamidehas been observed to be very irritating and caustic to the skin (AmericanCyanamide Company n.d.). As a 25-percent solution, which is commonly used,10 mL/kg applied to the skin of rabbits caused no fatalities or signs ofsystemic toxicity. Irritation occurred in the form of primary skin irritationand, following instillation into the eye, slight irritation of the conjunctivalsac (American Cyanamide Company n.d.). When cyanamide is ingested or inhaled by a person who has also consumedan alcoholic beverage, the person experiences vasodilation of the faceand neck, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Thissyndrome is referred to as the Antabuse effect. Studies of cyanamide'sAntabuse-like effects indicate that the effect is about one-half that oftetraethylthiuram disulfide (Antabuse) and one-sixth that of tetramethylthiuram disulfide (Hald, Jacobsen, and Larsen et al. n.d.). OSHA proposes a limit of 2 mg/m\3\ TWA for cyanamide.

Dicrotophos is a cholinesterase inhibitor (ACGIH 1986, p. 193). The acuteoral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 22 mg/kg, and the percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 224 mg/kg (Stanford Research Institute 1962,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 193). Another study reports the oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats as 16 to 21 mg/kg and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in the same species as 42 mg/kg (Gaines 1969). Two-year feedingstudies in rats given 0, 1, 10, or 100 ppm dicrotophos showed no detectableeffects at the 1-ppm concentration. At the higher concentrations, decreasedbody weights (as compared to controls) and cholesterinase inhibition wereobserved (Woodward Research Corporation 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p.193). Dietary studies in dogs showed both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesteraseinhibition at a 16-ppm concentration, but no significant ill effects atconcentrations of 0, 0.16, or 1.6 ppm (Woodward Research Corporation 1967,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 193). Studies of vapor inhalation in male ratshave shown that transient illness occurred after a 1-hour exposure to 910mg/m\3\ technical dicrotophos, and 2620 mg/m\3\ or 2120 mg/m\3\ of 38-percentdicrotophos (Kettering Laboratories 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986). Dicrotophosdoes not cause demyelinization in chickens (Tunstall Laboratory 1965; KetteringLaboratory 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 193), and it is metabolizedin a fashion similar to mono-microtophos (Menzer and Casida 1965). TheACGIH (1986, p. 193) reports that dicrotophos penetrates the skin. The ACGIH recommendation is based on the data described above and, in part,by analogy to other cholinesterase-inhibiting substances. OSHA is proposingan 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit of 0.25 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation,for dicrotophos. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willprotect exposed workers from the metabolic effects, such as cholinesteraseinhibition, potentially associated with inhalation, ingestion, and dermalexposure to this substance.

One of the major toxic effects of dimethylaniline exposure is methemoglobinemia,although authorities disagree concerning the level at which humans cantolerate exposure to this substance (ACGIH 1986, p. 207). Hamblin (1962) reported that dimethylaniline is quantitatively less toxicthan aniline. Dogs administered a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg exhibitedmethemoglobinemia, and absorption through the skin can increase the overallexposure (Hamblin 1962). Mayer (1930) reported that dimethylaniline's necroticpotential was markedly lower than that of aniline, which has a TLV-TWAof 2 ppm. However, von Oettingen (1941) stated that dimethylaniline hasa greater depressant effect on the nervous system than does aniline. The literature on industrial experience with dimethylaniline is limited.Hamilton (1919) reported collapse, prolonged unconsciousness, visual disturbance,and intense abdominal pain following severe exposure of two workers. The Agency is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 ppm and a short-term limitof 10 ppm, with a skin notation, for dimethylaniline. OSHA believes thatthe STEL is necessary to afford protection from CNS depression followingacute exposures.

The ACGIH recommends  a  limit  of  0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation.Dioxathion is a nonvolatile, very stable, dark amber liquid. The pesticide, dioxathion, contains both the cis- and trans-isomers of2,3-p-dioxanedithiol; the cis-isomer is approximately four times as acutelytoxic as the trans-isomer ACGIH 1986, p. 219). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for rats range from 23 to 118 mg/kg (with mostvalues in the 23- to 64-mg/kg portion of the range); in dogs, oral LD<T2>50</T2>s range from 10 to 40 mg/kg. The LC<T2>50</T2> in rats is 1398 mg/m;\3\ in mice, it is 340 mg/m\3\ (Hercules,Inc. 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 219). The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats and rabbits are reported to be 63 and 85 mg/kg, respectively(NIOSH 1983). Instillation of 0.1 ml dioxathion into the rabbit eye producesmild, transient conjunctivitis but no corneal damage (ACGIH 1986, p. 219).In subacute oral toxicity studies, the no-effect dose level in rats wasreported to be 0.22 mg/kg/day; in dogs, a no-effect level of between 0.075and 0.25 mg/kg/day was indicated (Frawley, Weir, Tusing et al. 1963). Dioxathionwas reported not to produce myelin degeneration in chickens (Frawley, Weir,Tusing et al. 1963). The no-effect level in multigenerational studies ofreproductive effects in rats was reported to be 10 ppm (Kennedy, Frawley,and Colandra 1973). Human volunteers who ingested 0.075 mg/kg/day had no symptoms related toplasma or blood cholinesterase activity, while those ingesting 0.15 mg/kg/dayexhibited a slight decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity (Frawley,Weir, and Tusing et al. 1963). The World Health Organization has estimatedan acceptable daily intake for man of 0.0015 mg dioxathion/kg (WHO, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 219). Other organophosphorous compounds have beendemonstrated to produce levels of cholinesterase inhibition analogous tothose produced by dioxathion (ACGIH 1986, p. 219).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ for dioxathion; theAgency also proposes a skin notation for dioxathion. OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that these limits will protect exposed workers against the riskof metabolic effects associated with inhalation and oral exposure and withdermal penetration of this substance, which is currently not regulatedby OSHA. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit for dioxathion. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">DISULFIRAM </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 97-77-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>20</T2>N<T2>2</T2>S<T2>4 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1151</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for disulfiram. The ACGIH recommends a limitof 2 mg/m\3\ TWA for this crystalline solid. Disulfiram has a very low order of acute oral toxicity in laboratory animals(ACGIH 1986, p. 225). The LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is reported as 8.6 g/kg (The Merck Index 1983, pp.491-492), and the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is reported to be 2.05 g/kg (Brieger 1947). Thecompound is highly toxic when injected intraperitoneally, with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 75 mg/kg for mice (National Technical Information Service,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 225). The effects of high-dose ingestion includedegenerative changes in the liver and kidneys. Very high doses can causeleukopenia and marked hypoplasia or aplasia of the bone marrow; in themost seriously afflicted animals, the blood urea nitrogen sometimes increasedand the thymol turbidity test was positive (Brieger 1947). Adverse health effects occur in humans consuming alcohol and simultaneouslyexposed to disulfiram. This represents a significant concern since disulfiram,under the trade name Antabuse, is used as a medication in the treatmentof chronic alcoholism. For individuals who drink alcohol and are exposedto disulfiram, the symptoms of exposure are facial vasodilation, tachycardia,tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, pallor, and hypotension. High doses of disulfiramcan induce convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction,and the compound has also been associated with polyneuropathy, peripheralneuritis, and skin eruption (Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties1968). In industry, there have been reports of minimal skin irritation(Mastromatteo, as cited in ACIGH 1986, p. 225) and of optic neuritis (Nortonand Walsh 1972). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 2 mg/m\3\ TWA for disulfiram. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect workers against the risk of Antabuse-likeeffects associated with exposure to airborne concentrations of disulfuramin combination with alcohol consumption. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for disulfiram. At the time of the finalrule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that thislimit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ETHION (NIALATE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 563-12-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>22</T2>O<T2>4</T2>P<T2>2</T2>S<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1160</ITAG>OSHA currently has no permissible exposure limit for ethion. The ACGIHrecommends a limit of 0.4 mg/m\3\ TWA, with a skin notation. Pure ethionis an odorless and colorless liquid. The technical material has a verydisagreeable odor. Ethion, is an insecticide that is used in a variety of forms, including25-percent wettable powder, 2-, 3-, and 4-percent dust, 5-percent granules,and in several oil solutions and combinations with other chemicals. Asa result, the acute toxicity values reported vary considerably. NIOSH (1974) reports an oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 13 mg/kg. Other reported values for oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats include 65 mg/kg, 96 mg/kg, and 208 mg/kg (ClinicalHandbook on Economic Poisons; Farm Chemicals Handbook A74; Pesticide ChemicalsOfficial Compendium; all as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 236). Studies with95 percent technical ethion report oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 87.4andplusmin;0.16 mg/kg for albino rats and 24.4 mg/kgfor female rats (Niagara Chemical Division, FMC Corp., as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 236). Inhalation studies report LC<T2>50</T2> values of 710 mg/m\3\ for female rats exposed to 25-percentwettable powder dust for 1 hour, and 7200 mg/m\3\ for male rats similarlyexposed. Dermal exposure studies employing technical Nialate report a medianacute dermal lethal dose of 915 mg/kg, demonstrating ethion's ability topenetrate skin; instillation of 0.05 ml ethion in the rabbit eye is immediatelyirritating but does not cause corneal scarring (Niagara Chemical Division,FMC Corp., as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 236). Dietary studies of rats fed600, 1000, or 1500 ppm showed complete cholinesterase inhibition; 300 ppmin the diet produced marked cholinesterase inhibition (Pesticide ChemicalsOfficial Compendium, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 236). Ethion poisonings have been reported in workers harvesting grapes and peaches(State of California: Department of Industrial Relations, as cited in ACGIH1986. p. 236). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.4 mg/m\3\ TWA for ethion. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect exposed workers from the risk oforganophosphate poisoning and cholinesterase inhibition posed to workersin the absence of any OSHA limit. The Agency notes this substance's potentialfor dermal absorption in laboratory animals and is proposing a skin notationto protect against the risk of systemic toxicity possible in the absenceof a skin notation. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for ethion. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">FENAMIPHOS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 22224-92-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>13</T2>H<T2>22</T2>NO<T2>3</T2>PS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1173</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for fenamiphos. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 0.1 mg/m\3\ for this substance, with a skin notation. Fenamiphos isa tan-colored and waxy solid. Fenamiphos is a cholinesterase inhibitor that produces both central andperipheral cholinergic reactions (WHO 1975). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for fenamiphos are 2 to 19 mg/kg in rats, 22mg/kg in mice, 56 to 100 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 10 to 17 mg/kg in rabbits,and approximately 10 mg/kg in cats and dogs. Acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2> values are 72 to 154 mg/kg in rats and 178 to 225 mg/kg inrabbits. One- and 4-hour exposures of rats to fenamiphos aerosols resultedin LC<T2>50</T2> values of 110 to 175 and 91 mg/m\3\ to 100 mg/m\3\ of air,respectively. Rabbits exhibited no dermal or eye irritation (WHO 1975;Loeser and Kimmerle 1971).Rats exposed to fenamiphos aerosol at concentrations of 0.03, 0.25, or3.5 mg/m\3\ of air for 3 weeks exhibited no symptoms. At 3.5 mg/m\3\, ratsshowed significant depression of plasma cholinesterase; 0.25 mg/m\3\ wasthe highest no-effect concentration observed (Kimmerle, as cited in ACGIH1986, p. 265). Two-year feeding studies of dogs (0.5, 1.0, and 10 ppm)and rats (3, 10, and 30 ppm) revealed no treatment-related toxic or oncogeniceffects or tissue changes at a dietary level of 10 ppm; no-observable-effectlevels were 3 ppm for the rat and 1 ppm for the dog (WHO 1975). Studiesof rabbits and rats showed no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects, and resultsof a 3-generation study in rats showed that fenamiphos had no effect onreproduction (WHO 1975). Studies of mice have also shown no mutagenic effects,and a study of chickens demonstrated no delayed neurotoxic effects (WHO1975; Kimmerle, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 265). Fenamiphos is metabolizedrapidly and excreted primarily in the urine, as demonstrated in absorptiontests of the skin and digestive and respiratory tracts of rats and cows(Waggoner and Khasawinah 1974). There are no reports of human poisonings caused by exposure to fenamiphos,and no quantitative data are available relating adverse health effectsto measurable airborne concentrations of fenamiphos. OSHA proposes a PEL for this substance of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA to protect againstthe risk of anti-cholinesterase effects. A skin notation is also proposedbased on the evidence of percutaneous absorption of fenamiphos in experimentalanimals. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits will substantiallyreduce this risk. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga new limit for fenamiphos. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgatea new limit if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">FENSULFOTHION (DASANIT) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 115-90-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>11</T2>H<T2>17</T2>O<T2>4</T2>PS<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1174</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for fensulfothion. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 0.1 mg/m\3\ Fensulfothion is a brown liquid at room temperature. Fensulfothion has an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 4 mg/kg in male rats, and 1.8 mg/kg in female rats. Aerosolinhalation studies in rats have shown LC<T2>50</T2>s of 113 mg/m\3\ for a 1-hour exposure and 29.5 mg/m\3\ fora 4-hour exposure (Luser and Kimmerle 1971). This insecticide has beenshown to have effects similar to those of the other thiophosphates, whichcause cholinesterase inhibition. Dermal toxicity is relatively high, withLD<T2>50</T2> values ranging between 14 and 30 mg/kg for male rats and between3.5 and 3.0 mg/kg for females (NIOSH 1974). Tests of mice and rabbits haveshown no embryotoxic, reproductive or mutagenic effects. The no-effectdietary level in subchronic feeding studies is reported to be 1 ppm inrats and 2 ppm in dogs. The no-effect level for cholinesterase inhibitionis reported as 1 ppm in the diet for both dogs and cats (ACGIH 1986, p.266). In humans, dermal studies have shown irritation without cholinesteraseeffects from 2-hour twice-daily applications of a 5-percent granular formulationto the forearms of three subjects. Systemic absorption through the lungshas been demonstrated after inhalation of fensulfothion aerosols (ACGIH1986, p. 266). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA for this previously unregulatedsubstance to reduce the risks of metabolic effects and skin irritation.The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will substantially reducethis risk.

No. 1175</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for fenthion. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation. Fenthion is a yellow-to-tan, oilyliquid that smells slightly like garlic. The primary health effect associated with exposure to fenthion is plasmacholinesterase inhibition. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> values for the rat and rabbit are 215 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg,respectively, and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 330 mg/kg (<T3>Farm Chemicals Handbook </T3>1976; NIOSH 1977). Rats given single intramuscularinjections of 5, 25, or 50 mg/kg of fenthion exhibited enduring changesin the electroretinogram (ERG) and cholinesterase activity; pseudocholinesteraseactivity in the plasma dropped to 50 percent of normal on the fourth dayafter injection. The retinal effects of fenthion persisted for as longas 50 days (Imai 1975). Groups of Donryn rats fed 300 ppm fenthion dailyshowed symptoms of organophosphate intoxication, including nervousness,general spasms, diarrhea, salivation, and ophthalmologic effects (Kawai,Tojo, Miyazawa et al. 1976). The no-effect inhalation level for rats hasbeen reported to be 1 ppm for exposures of 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for3 weeks (Thyssen 1979, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 267); the 4-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> in the rat is between 800 and 1200 mg/m\3\ Thyssen 1978, ascited in ACGIH 1986, p. 267). No mutagenic, carcinogenic, or reproductive effects have been reported(WHO 1976; Food and Agriculture Organization 1979; Shirasu, Moriya, Katoet al. 1976; Hanna and Dyer 1975; Oesch 1977; Simmon, Mitchell, and Jergenson1977; Herbold 1980). Single and repeated applications of the compound haveshown no delayed neurotoxic effects in chickens (WHO 1972). Two-year feedingstudies of rhesus monkeys have shown plasma cholinesterase inhibition onlyat the highest oral dose given, i.e., 0.2 mg/kg daily (Rosenblum 1980).Griffin, Rosenblum, and Coulston (1979) reported cholinesterase depressionin humans at oral doses of 0.07 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks, but no effectwas observed at 0.02 mg/kg. The lowest lethal dose for humans is 50 mg/kg(<T3>Farm Chemicals Handbook </T3>1976; NIOSH 1977). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation,for fenthion. The Agency preliminarily concludes that these limits willprotect workers against the risk of cholinergic effects associated withexposures to this substance at the levels permitted by the absence of anyOSHA limit. A skin notation is proposed because of evidence that fenthionis readily absorbed through the skin. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for fenthion.

No. 1245</ITAG>OSHA currently has no limit for methomyl. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 2.5 mg/m\3\ for this white crystalline solid with a slightly sulfurousodor.Methomyl is a cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticide. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported to be between 25 and 40 mg/kg (Dashielland Kennedy 1984). Studies of dermal effects have reported no appreciableirritation or sensitization effects in guinea pigs. Instillation of a 10-percentsolution of methomyl in propylene glycol or of the dry material into rabbiteyes caused mild conjunctivitis without corneal injury. However, markedpupillary constriction, a health effect produced commonly by cholinesteraseinhibitors, occurred (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., as cited inACGIH 1986, p. 363). The LC<T2>50</T2> of unformulated methomyl as mist is 0.3 mg/L at 4-hour exposures;the lethal concentration in rats exposed to a 90-percent water-solubleformulation with a particle size of less than 10 microns was approximately0.45 mg/L. Inhalation studies have reported no fatalities resulting from 4-hour exposuresto the saturated vapor. There is no clinical evidence of cumulative toxicityresulting from 10 doses of 5.1 mg/kg/day over a 14-day period (Harvey,Jelnek, and Sherman 1973). Methomyl is rapidly metabolized and excretedin the urine, and cholinesterase inhibition is thus quickly reversed. Indogs, a dose of 20 mg/kg (one-half the lethal dose) produced symptoms ofintoxication and cholinesterase inhibition that disappeared within 2 to4 hours after cessation of exposure (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc.as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 363). No depression of cholinesterase activitycould be detected in rats fed at levels of 0, 200, 400, or 800 ppm methomylfor 79 days. In dogs, 90-day and 2-year feeding studies have shown no effectat 0, 50, 100, or 400 ppm; however, animals fed at 1000 ppm did demonstratetoxicity. Similar studies of rats have shown kidney, liver, and spleendamage at higher feeding levels, but the no-effect level for both ratsand dogs has been reported to be 100 ppm (Kaplan and Sherman 1977). OSHA is proposing a PEL of 2.5 mg/m\3\ TWA for methomyl. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect exposed workers against the riskof cholinesterase inhibition to which they could otherwise be exposed inthe absence of any OSHA limit. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a new limit for methomyl. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">MONOMETHYLANILINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-61-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>NH(CH<T2>3</T2>) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has a limit of 0.5 ppm TWA for monomethylaniline,with a skin notation. Monomethylaniline is a colorless liquid which turnsreddish-brown after standing. Treon, Deichmann, Sigmon, and associates (1949) found that monomethylanilineapplied to the skin of laboratory animals resulted in systemic poisoning,and that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits was 280 mg/kg. A later study by Treon and his associates(1950) showed that guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats died from 130 or fewer7-hour exposures to 7.6 ppm monomethyl aniline. In the same study, a monkeysurvived the same number and length of exposures at 2.4 ppm, and a dogsurvived 50 exposures at 86 ppm. Exposed animals later developed bloodchanges, including methemoglobinemia and Heinz bodies. OSHA is proposing a 0.5-ppm TWA limit, with a skin notation, for this substance.The Agency preliminarily concludes that these two limits, taken togetherwill protect exposed workers from the risk of metabolic and blood effects,such as methemoglobinemia, potentially associated with exposure to monomethylaniline.The skin notation will protect workers from the risk of systemic poisoningposed by skin absorption of this substance. The health evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level.

The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 3 mg/m\3\with a skin notation. para-Nitrochlorobenzene exists as yellow crystalsand has a sweet odor. The primary hazards associated with exposure to PNCB include systemic toxicityto the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and kidneys, as well as methemoglobinemiaand DNA damage. The Monsanto Company (1977) reported an oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 530 mg/kg and a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits of greater than 3040 mg/kg; PNCB was absorbed throughrabbit skin to produce methemoglobinemia (Kubota 1960), although applicationto the skin or eyes did not produce irritation (Monsanto Company 1977).Rusakov and associates (1973) described sensitization in guinea pigs afterdermal application of PNCB.A 4-hour inhalation exposure of rats (heads only) showed that the lethalconcentration was approximately 16.1 mg/L (Du Pont Company 198l, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 432). Head-only exposures at 0.05, 0.29, or 0.64 mg/LPNCB for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks resulted in spleen weightincreases and blood effects in all groups. In addition, there were dose-relatedeffects in blood methemoglobin levels, i.e., decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit,and red blood cell count values. Microscopic changes in the spleen, bonemarrow, and kidneys were seen in the two higher-dose groups, and pathologicaldegeneration of the seminiferous tubules and abnormal epididymal spermcontents were also observed in these groups (Du Pont Company 1984, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 432). The Monsanto Company (1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 432) reported thata 90-day gavage administration of PNCB at daily doses of 0.3, 10, or 30mg/kg to male and female rats produced hemolytic effects and spleen changesat all levels, kidney and liver effects at mid- to high-level doses, andhyperplasia of bone marrow and testicular atrophy at the highest dose (30mg/kg/day). In 1985, Monsanto reported the results of another gavage studyin rats. After 2 years of PNCB feeding at 0.1, 0.7, or 5.0 mg/kg/day, animalsin the mid- and high-dose groups exhibited hemolytic effects; in addition,mid- and high-dose groups showed microscopic spleen, kidney, and liverchanges and, at the highest dose, bone marrow hyperplasia and testicularatrophy were seen (Monsanto Company 1985, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 432).Rats fed PNCB at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.7, or 5 mg/kg/day for up to 2 yearsshowed methemoglobinemia at the two highest levels, and animals in the5 mg/kg/day group had indications of anemia and pigment accumulation inspleen cells. No treatment-related increase in tumors was observed (MonsantoCompany 1985, as cited in ACIGH 1986, p. 432). In a dietary cancer bioassay,rats and mice were given PNCB at unspecified levels for 2 years (Weisberger,et al. 1978). Only mice were affected, with mice of both sexes showingan increase in vascular tumors at the highest dose and male mice showingan increase in liver tumors at the lowest dose (Weisberger et al. 1978).Maternal toxicity was seen in rats given PNCB by gavage at doses of 15and 45 mg/kg/day on days 9 through 16 of gestation; at the 45-mg/kg level,fetotoxicity and teratogenicity were also observed (Nair et al. 1985).At 15 mg/kg, maternal toxicity but no fetotoxicity or teratogenic effectsoccurred; at the lowest dose, the only effect was a small increase in maternalspleen weight. A two-generation reproductive study resulted in a reducedmating index in rats given 0.7 or 5.0 mg/kg/day (Monsanto Company) 1984,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 432). Positive responses were observed in amutation assay of L5178Y TK mouse lymphoma cells (both in the presenceand absence of metabolic activation) and in a microbial assay of <T3>Salmonella </T3>strain TA 1535 (in the absence of metabolic activation);however, no evidence of mutagenicity was noted in assays of three other<T3>Salmonella </T3>strains or in assays of Chinese hamster ovary cells,rat hepatocyte primary culture/DNA repair, or rat bone marrow cell clastogenesis(Monsanto Company 1980-1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 432). PNCB producedDNA damage in the liver, kidney, and brain cells of rats after a singleintraperitoneal dose of 30 to 1000 mg/kg (Cesarone et al. 1983) and incultured hepatocytes at 1.5 hours after a 3-hour treatment (Cesarone etal. 1984). p-Nitrochlorobenzene may be absorbed through the lungs and skin in humansto produce methemoglobin. Reports of industrial exposures indicate thatoverexposure causes cyanosis, weakness, and headache (Saita and Moreo 1958;Renshaw 1926). In a study of workmen exposed to average concentrationsof PNCB at 55, 125, and 143 ppm and to a PNCB-nitrophenol mixture at 23ppm, the authors concluded that the mixed exposure did not produce chronicintoxication, but did cause increased methemoglobin, the appearance ofHeinz bodies, headache, vertigo, and occasional eczema; these effects couldnot be attributed definitely either to skin absorption or to the levelof PNCB in the mixture (Pacseri et al. 1958). No data are reported forthe p-nitrochlorobenzene exposures only (Pacseri et al. 1958). OSHA is proposing to retain its current 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m\3\ forp-nitrochlorobenzene, with a skin notation. The Agency preliminarily concludesthat these limits are necessary to protect workers from the risk of methemoglobinemiaand changes in the spleen, liver, and kidney possible at higher exposurelevels. OSHA is retaining the skin notation because dermal absorption ofPNCB has been shown to cause systemic effects in animals.<ITAG tagnum="26">PROPOXUR </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 114-26-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>11</T2>H<T2>15</T2>NO<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Dietary studies in rats at levels of 7.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days or at 800ppm for 3 months produced no adverse effects (Association of American PesticideControl Officials, Inc., 1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 499). Rats were exposed to propoxur concentrations of 5, 7, 18.7, or 31.7 mg/m\3\6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks; animals in the high-dose group showeddepressed red blood cell and brain cholinesterase levels, and plasma cholinesterasewas depressed by as much as 20 to 30 percent (Association of America PesticideOfficials, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 499). In humans, a few cases of mild propoxur poisoning have been reported amongsprayers of this insecticide and among residents of propoxur-treated homes(Vandekar, Hedayat, Plestina, and Ahmady 1968). In a study of human volunteers,a single oral dose of 1.5 mg/kg propoxur caused gastrointestinal symptomsthat disappeared two hours after ingestion and a depression in red bloodcell cholinesterase; oral doses of 0.75 to 1.0 mg/kg produced no symptomsbut did depress erythrocyte cholinesterase (Vandekar, Plestina, and Wihelm1971). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m\3\ for propoxur. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against therisk of cholinesterase inhibition potentially associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limitfor propoxur.

The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in dogs is greater than 500 mg/kg (McCollister, Oyen, and Rowe1959). Two-year dietary studies of rats fed up to 50 mg/kg/day showed noeffect on growth rate, food consumption, survival or hematopoesis (McCollister,Oyen, and Rowe 1959). In a study by Gladenko and Stuk (1972), albino ratsdeveloped clinical symptoms of motor irritation, tremor, increased auditoryand tactile sensitivity, lacrimation, and salivation within 2 weeks atexposure levels between 164 and 328 mg/kg; some animals died during thelatter part of the study. At exposures below 16.4 mg/kg, no ill effectswere observed (Gladenko and Stuk 1972). A 2-year feeding study in dogsexposed at 10 mg/kg showed no ill effects except cholinesterase depletion(Worden, Noel, and Mawdsley-Thomas 1972). Patch tests of 50 human subjects showed that ronnel has no skin-sensitizingpotential (McCollister, Oyen, and Rowe 1959). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for ronnel. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers against therisk of cholinergic effects potentially associated with exposure to thissubstance.

No. 1380</ITAG>OSHA's Z tables currently have no limit for sulprofos. The ACGIH recommendsan exposure limit of 1 Mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA. Sulprofos, also knownas the insecticide BolstarR, is a tan liquid. Kimmerle (1982, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 547) conducted an extensiveanimal study on the effects of sulprofos. He reported that the acute toxicityof sulprofos is species-dependent; rats have an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 100 to 300 mg/kg and mice have an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 1600 to 1800 mg/kg. The acute dermal toxicity of this substanceis low, with an LD<T2>50</T2> greater than 1000 ml/kg in rats and 800 to 1000 mg/kg in rabbits.In rabbits, sulprofos did not irritate the skin or eyes, and it had nodermal sensitization effects ln guinea pigs. Inhalation studies showedno fatalities in rats exposed to aerosol concentrations of up to 4130 mg/m\3\of sulprofos over a period of 4 hours. In a 3-week inhalation study inwhich rats were exposed to aerosol concentrations of 6, 14, or 74 mg/m\3\,the two highest concentrations produced cholinergic symptoms; no observableeffects were seen at the lowest concentration. Two-year feeding studiesby Kimmerle (as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 547) in dogs, rats, and mice showedthat sulprofos concentrations of 150 ppm, 250 ppm, or 400 ppm were toleratedby all species, with no sulprofos-related tissue changes, signs of toxicity,or oncogenic effects. The overall NOELs were 10 ppm in dogs, 6 ppm in rats,and 2.5 ppm in mice. Kimmerle's ingestion studies in rats and rabbits atlevels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day of sulprofos showed no embryotoxic orteratogenic effects in these animals, and a three-generation diet studyin rats also produced no adverse reproductive effects. Mutagenic studiesreported by the same author in mice were negative. Separate subacute inhalationstudies also showed no effects on blood cholinesterase levels in rats exposedto 6 mg/m\3\ Zielhuis and Van der Kreek 1979). There are no reported cases of poisoning in humans (ACGIH 1986, p. 547).OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m\3\ for sulprofos. The Agencypreliminarily concludes that this limit will protect workers from the riskof cholinesterase inhibition, the most sensitive indicator of exposureto this currently unregulated substance. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for sulprofos.

No. 1384</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for the terphenyls is 1.0 ppm as a ceiling limit.The ACGIH recommends a 0.5-ppm ceiling limit for these substances. Terphenylsare colorless or light-yellow solids and are used as coolants in nuclearreactors. Commercial preparations contain mixtures of ortho, meta, andpara terphenyls. The terphenyls are primary irritants that cause eye, skin, and respiratoryirritation. Haley, Detrick, Kosmeau et al. (1959) reported that mixtures of terphenylscaused conjunctival irritation when instilled into the eyes of rabbitsand damaged guinea pig skin following intracutaneous injection. Cornish,Bahor, and Ryan (1962) determined LD<T2>50</T2> values of 1900, 2400, and greater than 10,000 mg/kg for theortho, meta-, and para-terphenyls, respectively. These authors also conducted30-day feeding studies of rats involving doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg/dayof the individual terphenyl isomers. Rats fed ortho-terphenyl showed elevatedliver and kidney weight ratios; rats fed meta-terphenyl displayed elevatedkidney weight ratios only; and rats fed para-terphenyl showed no elevationin liver or kidney weight ratios. Two studies by Petkau and Hoogstraaten(1965) and Young, Petkau, and Hoogstraaten (1969) have shown that the terphenylshave nephrotoxic effects and cause hepatic damage in rats fed 33 mg/kg/day.Adamson, Bowden, and Wyatt (1969) published a study in which rats exposedto terphenyl aerosols for 7 hours per day at a concentration of 50 mg/m\3\for a period of 8 days developed morphological changes in their pulmonarycell mitochondria: the number of vacuolated mitochondria was directly relatedto duration of exposure. Weeks and Lentle (1970, 1971) conducted a clinical survey of 47 workerswith ongoing exposure to terphenyl coolant in a nuclear facility. The studyrepresented 122 man-years of occupational exposure, with duration of exposureranging from 6 months to 7 years. The airborne concentrations of terphenylvaried, measuring 0.094 mg/m\3\ in general working areas and up to 0.89mg/m\3\ in areas with organic piping equipment. The terphenyl coolant wasdetermined to be a primary irritant, even in those workers wearing protectiveclothing, because skin moistness increased sensitivity to the terphenyls(Weeks and Lentle 1970, 1971). Testa and Masi (1964) reported that at concentrationsabove 10 mg/m\3\ (approximately 1 ppm), workers reported both eye and respiratoryirritation.OSHA is proposing a ceiling of 0.5 ppm for the terphenyls. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that this limit will protect exposed workers against the riskof primary irritation of the eyes, skin, and upper respiratory tract andof mitochondrial changes potentially associated with exposure to very lowlevels of the terphenyls. The health evidence forms a reasonable basisfor proposing a revision to this level. At the time of the final rule,OSHA will establish a new limit for terphenyls if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">m-TOLUIDINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-44-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>9</T2>N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1401</ITAG>m-Toluidine currently has no OSHA permissible exposure limit. The ACGIHrecommends a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. m-Toluidine is a lightyellow liquid. When m-toluidine was tested on the eyes and skin of rabbits, moderate tostrong irritation effects resulted (NIOSH 1979). A mean maximal methemoglobinemiaof 60.2 percent was reported to occur following the intravenous administrationof 27 mg m-toluidine per kilogram body weight in cats (McLean, Starner,and Thomas 1969). Rodent carcinogenicity studies cited by the ACGIH (1986,p. 589) were either inconclusive or negative. The effects in humans of exposure to m-toluidine, either absorbed throughthe skin or via inhalation, are hematuria and methemoglobinemia. Exposureto 40 ppm for 60 minutes causes severe poisoning (Goldblatt 1955). Thereare no epidemiological studies of workers exposed only to m-toluidine (ACGIH1986, p. 589). OSHA is proposing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA and a skin notation for this previouslyunregulated chemical. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limitwill protect workers from the risk of metabolic effects, such as hematuriaand methemoglobinemia, associated with exposure to m-toluidine at levelscurrently permitted in the absence of any OSHA PEL. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for m-toluidine.

No. 1413</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is 1.5 mg/m\3\ as an8-hour TWA with a skin notation. The ACGIH has set a standard of 0.5 TLV-TWAwith a skin notation for this chemical. TNT occurs as yellow needle-likecrystals and is used as an explosive. The ACGIH's limit was selected on the basis of health surveys conductedamong occupationally exposed workers. Fairhall (1957) describes dermatitis,cyanosis, gastritis, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, and aplastic anemiaas possible effects of exposure to TNT. According to Sollman (1957), blooddestruction, leucocytosis or leucopenia, and varying degrees of centralnervous system change (probably resulting from anoxia, peripheral neuritisand muscular pains, cardiac muscular and menstrual irregularities, andurinary and renal irritation) can also occur as a consequence of TNT exposure.TNT has irritant properties, and may cause sneezing, sore throat, or skinirritation (von Oettingen 1941). A study by Goodwin (1972) revealed 36 cases of liver damage in a munitionsplant where workers were exposed to a mean air level of 2.38 mg/m\3\ TNTover a period of 20 years. Another study (Morton et al. 1976) found elevatedlevels of liver enzymes in 43 TNT shell-packers and loaders who workedwhere TNT exposures ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 mg/m\3\ over a period of 5 months.In 1975, Djerassi and Vitany published a paper describing hemolytic episodesin three TNT workers with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency;although these workers were from Iraq, where G-6-PDase deficiency has ahigh (25 percent) frequency of occurrence, the study is also of concernfor other workers having a high frequency of G-6-PDase deficiency. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m\3\ with a skin notation for2,4,6-trinitrotoluene. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limitis necessary to protect workers against the risk of liver damage and hemolyticeffects potentially associated with exposure to TNT. The health evidenceforms a reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for 2,4,6-trinitrotolueneif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk. Preliminary Conclusions For the class of toxic substances having biochemical/metabolic effects,OSHA preliminarily concludes that occupational exposure presents significantrisks. The effects associated with exposure to these substances (whichinhibit cholinesterase activity, interfere with the blood's ability tocarry oxygen, and produce Antabuse-like symptoms and signs) range fromnausea, bronchoconstriction, cardiac irregularities, neurobehavioral effects,and unconsciousness, to coma and death, depending on the severity of theexposure. Because many of these substances are relatively new on the industrialscene, OSHA has no limits for them. This situation means that occupationalexposures can potentially be uncontrolled, which increases the urgencythat limits be adopted. The Agency thus preliminarily finds that establishingor revising limits for this group of toxicants will reduce occupationalrisks. The health evidence discussed in this section provides a reasonablebasis for proposing revised or new limits for these substances. At thetime of the final rule, OSHA will revise or add new limits for this groupof metabolic toxins if the Agency determines that these limits will substantiallyreduce significant risk. <ITAG tagnum="81">14. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofSensitization Effects </ITAG>Introduction OSHA is proposing limits for eight substances based on their sensitizationpotential. Table C14-1 lists the current OSHA PELs, ACGIH Limits, and NIOSHRELs for each chemical in this group, along with their CAS and HS numbers.In four cases, current OSHA regulations set no limit on exposure. For twosubstances, OSHA is proposing to reduce its current TWA-PEL. In one otherinstance, OSHA is proposing to replace its current ceiling limit with an8-hour TWA-PEL and a 15-minute STEL. For the remaining substance, the additionof a STEL with no change in the current TWA-PEL is proposed. NIOSH hasrecommended exposure limits for three substances that cause sensitization;OSHA is proposing the REL value for one of these chemicals, isophoronediisocyanate.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2742-743</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects A sensitization reaction, also known as an allergic reaction, is definedas an adverse response to a chemical following a previous exposure to thatchemical or to a structurally similar one (Klaasen 1986). The subject whosuffers an allergic reaction is said to have become sensitized to thatchemical. Sensitization is the result of an immune reaction to the chemical;although the initial exposure does not generate an immediate response,the immune system ``remembers'' the chemical and reacts strongly at thenext encounter. A related phenomenon is cross-sensitization. Cross-sensitizationoccurs when exposure to one chemical elicits a sensitization reaction notonly on subsequent exposure to the same chemical but also on exposure toa different chemical, usually one with a similar structure. The toxic manifestations of a sensitization reaction vary both in theirlocation and severity. In humans, common target organs are the skin andthe eyes; typical allergic conditions in these organ systems are allergiccontact dermatitis and conjunctivitis, respectively. The respiratory systemcan also be sensitized; the resulting pathologies include bronchitis andasthma (Dean et al. 1986). These allergic reactions are mediated by thetwo immunoglobulins IqD or IqE. Involvement of IqD results in delayed contactdermatitis. In contrast, IqE-mediated reactions cause very severe effects,such as acute asthmatic attack, urticaria, and anaphylactic shock, whichcan be fatal. The unpredictability and potential seriousness of sensitizationreactions demand that exposures be carefully controlled. Sensitivity to a chemical frequently persists throughout the lifetime ofan individual; occasionally it may gradually disappear over time. Usuallysymptoms are not observed after exposure to the sensitizing agent is discontinued.Although treatment for some allergies is possible, avoidance is consideredthe best way, and sometimes the only way, to regain good health. An additional cause for concern about exposure to sensitizing chemicalsis recent evidence that residual respiratory symptoms may continue evenafter exposure is discontinued. For example, in the case of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate(TDI), Weill et al. (1981) and Innocenti et al. (1981) found that sensitizedworkers may exhibit decreased pulmonary function or chronic bronchitisfor as long as 3\1/2\ years after cessation of exposure. Dose-Response Relationships and Sensitization Effects Like other toxic effects, allergic reactions are dose-related; that is,in response to increasing doses of the chemical, increasing numbers ofsubjects may be sensitized, and the subsequent reactions may be more severe.The time course of sensitization for any one individual is unpredictable.Some individuals are sensitized after only one exposure; others remainresistant to sensitization after a lifetime of exposure. Different peopleare generally sensitive to different chemicals, although some chemicalsare more universally reactive than others, such as the active agent inpoison ivy. Various parameters influence the likelihood of sensitizationby a particular chemical, such as ``the nature of the chemical, concentration,type of exposure, genetic susceptibility and nongenetic idiosyncrasies''(Emmett 1986). Sensitization reactions observed in occupational settingsare often the result of dermal or inhalation exposure. For most of the substances in this group, the proposed limits are basedon health surveys and reports of occupationally exposed populations. Thesestudies indicate that exposures below a certain no-effect level generallydo not result in individuals becoming sensitized. Where human data wereabsent or sparse, OSHA has relied on animal evidence to set the proposedlimit. However, since chemically induced immunological sensitization occursamong laboratory animals by the same mechanism as in humans (that is, immunereactions in animals can be mediated by either IqB or IqE immunoglobulins),sensitization reactions in animals are generally good predictors of immunereactions in humans. The discussions below describe OSHA's preliminary findings for the substancesin this group. These discussions illustrate the nature of the risk confrontingexposed employees, and the extent to which the risk of developing immunesensitization will be reduced among workers by the promulgation of theproposed limits.<ITAG tagnum="26">CAPTAFOL (DIFOLATAN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2425-06-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>9</T2>Cl<T2>4</T2>NO<T2>2</T2>S </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1066</ITAG>OSHA has no current permissible exposure limit for captafol. The ACGIHrecommends a TLV-TWA of 0.1 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation. Captafol isa white, crystalline substance with a slight but characteristic odor. A 2-year study conducted by the World Health Organization (Reinhardt andBrittelli 1981) reported growth depression in rats at captafol dietarylevels of 1500 and 5000 ppm, and histopathologic examination revealed changesin the livers and kidneys of the animals exposed at these levels. No tumorswere observed. In male rats, an increase in liver-to-body-weight ratiowas observed at levels of 250 ppm and higher after 12 months of captafolfeeding (Reinhardt and Brittelli 1981). In humans, skin irritation has been reported in both American and Japanesestudies of farmers applying captafol as a fungicide. Arimatsu (1970) reportsthat farmers using captafol have experienced acute contact dermatitis manifestingas erythematous dermatitis and phototoxic eruptions. Khan reports thatworkers cleaning up in an area where captafol was handled experienced skinand respiratory sensitization (written communication, 1975, as cited inACGIH 1986, p. 97). OSHA is proposing a permissible exposure limit for captafol of 0.1 mg/m\3\TWA, with a skin notation, to protect exposed workers against the riskof contact dermatitis and respiratory and skin sensitization associatedwith exposure to this substance at the levels permitted in the absenceof any OSHA limit. The Agency preliminarily concludes that the 8-hour TWA,combined with a skin notation, will substantially reduce this risk. Thehealth evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit forcaptafol. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limitif the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">COBALT (METAL, DUST AND FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-48-4; Chemical Formula: Co </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1100</ITAG>OSHA has a current 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for cobalt metal dustand fume. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for cobalt, whichis a gray, hard, magnetic, and somewhat malleable metal.Animal studies indicate that high intratracheal doses (10, 25, or 50 mg)of cobalt metal dust can cause obliterative bronchiolitis adenomatosisin guinea pigs (Schepers 1955). Additional studies in animals have shownthat exposure to cobalt dust or fumes causes hypersensitivity reactions.Increases in serum A-globulin and neuraminic acid occurred in dogs andrabbits exposed by inhalation to cobalt metal, metal fume, or carbide blend;injections of CoCl<T2>2</T2> produced similar reactions (Stokinger and Wagner 1958). Recentstudies conducted on miniswine have shown that inhalation of 0.1 mg/m\3\cobalt metal dust (50 percent alpha and 50 percent beta variety, with asize range of from 0.4andCx.18; to 3.6andCx.18;) has caused early (onset in3 months) pulmonary disease. Wheezing, which indicates hypersensitivity,occurred during the fourth week of exposure to 0.1 or 1.0 mg/m\3\ for 6hours/day, 5 days/week, for 3 months following a 1-week sensitizing dose(Kerfoot, Frederick, and Domeier 1975). Pulmonary disease has been reported frequently in workers exposed to cobaltin the manufacture of cemented tungsten carbide (Miller, Davis, Goldman,and Wyatt 1953: Lundgren and Ohman 1954; Lundgren and Swensson 1953). Theadverse effect of exposure is generally chronic interstitial pneumonitis.Fatalities have been reported occasionally from exposures to cobalt of1 to 2 mg/m\3\ or less (Fairhall, Castberg, Carrozzo, and Brinton 1947;Fairhall, Keenan, and Brinton 1959). An increase in serum A-2 globulinfraction was reported in the case of a welder exposed to fumes containingcobalt; the welder had a history of exertional dyspnea and an abnormalchest X-ray (Seigesmund et al. 1974). Schwartz, Tulipan, and Birmingham(1957) reported that allergic dermatitis has been caused by contact withcobalt and its compounds. In studies undertaken by the Michigan Department of Health, it was demonstratedthat, in the period between 1946 and 1964, improved control measures hadsuccessfully reduced cobalt metal dust and fume levels from 14.42 mg/m\3\to a level below 0.1 mg/m\3\. No new cases of systemic toxicity or dermatitishave since been associated with cobalt exposure. The Pennsylvania Departmentof Health demonstrated that concentrations could be controlled easily to0.07 mg/m\3\; without control, concentrations were about 0.5 mg/m\3\ (ACGIH1986, p. 144). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for cobalt metalfume and dust. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit willprovide workers exposed to cobalt metal dust and fume with protection againstthe risk of serious pulmonary injury demonstrated to occur at levels above0.1 mg/m\3\. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposinga revision to this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establisha new limit for cobalt if the Agency determines that this limit will substantiallyreduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">ISOPHORONE DIISOCYANATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 4098-71-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>18</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1222</ITAG>There is no current OSHA limit for isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). TheACGIH has recommended a TLV-TWA of 0.01 ppm, with a skin notation. NIOSH(1978) recommended a 10-hour TWA of 0.005 ppm for all isocyanates, witha 10-minute ceiling limit of 0.02 ppm.To date, there is little direct information on health effects associatedwith exposure to this chemical. However, diisocyanates, in general, causeirritation of the respiratory tract, decreases in pulmonary function, andsensitization. The ACGIH (1986) cited two reports in which workers exposedto isophorone diisocyanate suffered asthma or dyspnea (Clark and Aldons1981; Tyrer 1979). Neither of these reports contained quantitative exposuredata. The ACGIH recommended that the TLV-TWA for 2,4-toluene diisocyanate(TDI) apply to isophorone diisocyanate until more information becomes available;however, the ACGIH did not include its 0.02-ppm TLV-STEL for TDI in thisrecommendation. NIOSH (1978) came to the same conclusion, reasoning thatother diisocyanates would react similarly to TDI on a molar basis; therefore,NIOSH recommended that the limits established for TDI (0.005 ppm TWA and0.02 ppm as a 10-minute ceiling) apply to all diisocyanates. In supportingthe need for a ceiling limit for diisocyanates, NIOSH (1978) cites a reportin which 12 workers in an automobile plant developed severe respiratorysymptoms after exposure to 0.03 to 0.07 ppm TDI for one week. The ceilinglimit recommended by NIOSH is designed to prevent the irritation effectsof exposure to the diisocyanates in nonsensitized workers. OSHA is proposing a 0.005-ppm TWA, a 0.02-ppm ceiling (10-minute), anda skin notation for IPDI. The Agency believes that these limits will protectexposed nonsensitized workers against IPDI's sensitizing effects and minimizeasthmatic reactions among sensitized workers. OSHA's preliminary feasibilityanalysis is based on limited data at this level; the Agency requests additionalfeasibility information from the public. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a new limit for isophorone diisocyanate. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if the Agency determinesthat this limit will substantially reduce significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PHENOTHIAZINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 92-84-2; Chemical Formula: S(C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>)<T2>2</T2>NH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1313</ITAG>Currently, neither OSHA nor NIOSH has an occupational exposure limit forphenothiazine. The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TWA-PEL for this substanceof 5 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation. The Agency's recommendation is based primarily on a study by Mawhinneyand Rakow (1968) that showed that exposure to 15 to 48 mg/m\3\ of phenothiazinewas associated with skin sensitization in workers but not with more acutesystemic effects. Symptoms of sensitization included burning and an itchingsensation of the skin. The skin effects were identifiable as an allergicreaction because the employees developed a tolerance to phenothiazine exposureafter a few weeks (Mawhinney and Rakow 1968). Accompanying the sensitizationreaction were pinkish-red-colored hair and brown fingernails. OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m\3\, which represents athreefold margin of safety over the low end of the exposure range thatcauses sensitization reactions in workers. Because uncontrolled occupationalexposures to phenothiazine pose a risk of developing sensitization reactions,OSHA preliminarily concludes that adopting an exposure limit of 5 mg/m\3\will markedly reduce the risk of sensitization for workers. The healthevidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a new limit for phenothiazine.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will promulgate a new limit if theAgency determines that this limit will substantially reduce significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PHENYL GLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 122-60-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CHOCH<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Phenyl glycidyl ether is a colorlessliquid. Exposure to phenyl glycidyl ether causes systemic effects and irritation.Studies in 1956 by Hine, Kodama, Wellington, and colleagues showed pulmonaryinflammation and liver changes in some of the rats exposed for 7 hoursdaily for 50 days to 100 ppm; respiratory distress and minimal eye irritationwere also observed in the exposed animals. Intragastric LD<T2>50</T2> values of 1.40 g/kg for mice and 3.85   g/kg for rats werereported. Animals displayed central nervous system (CNS) depression, anddeath was caused by respiratory paralysis; in the survivors, these CNSeffects were transient. The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> reported for rabbits was 2.99 g/kg. Other studies have reporteda single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 4.26 g/kg, although exposure for 8 hours to the near-saturatedvapor was not lethal (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954). Terrilland Lee (1977) reported kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, and testicular changesin rats exposed to phenyl glycidyl ether at 29 ppm for 4 hours daily, 5days/week for 2 weeks. At concentrations of 12 or 5 ppm, these authorsobserved no effects other than hair loss after exposures of 6 hours/day,5 days/week for 9 weeks; however, after 18 weeks, 10 percent of male and25 percent of female rats exhibited alopecia. These health effects wereattributed by the authors to direct irritation of the skin rather thanto systemic absorption (Terrill and Lee 1977). Reports of workers using or handling this substance have described moderateskin irritation on prolonged or repeated contact, as well as several casesof skin sensitization (ACGIH 1986, p. 476). NIOSH (1978) notes that the glycidyl ethers are biologically reactive compoundsbecause of the presence of the epoxide group; these compounds have alsobeen shown to have cytotoxic effects and to be mutagenic in short-termbioassays. Terrill and Lee (1977) exposed rats repeatedly to 1 ppm PGEand observed no effects, although skin damage was observed at 5 ppm. Inconclusiveevidence of testicular degeneration was reported in some of the rats exposedto levels as low as 1.75 ppm (Haskell Laboratory Reports, as cited in NIOSH1978, p. 114). At 10 ppm, 5 day/week exposures for 10 weeks caused respiratorytract irritation and early signs of liver necrosis in rats (Hine, Kodama,Wellington, Dunlap, and Anderson 1956). OSHA is proposing to reduce the 8-hour TWA for phenyl glycidyl ether to1 ppm. The Agency preliminarily concludes that this limit will protectexposed workers from the risk of skin and respiratory tract irritation,skin sensitization, testicular damage, and liver necrosis potentially associatedwith exposure to the current limit of 10 ppm. OSHA believes that the revisedlimit will substantially reduce these risks. The health evidence formsa reasonable basis for proposing a revision to this level. At the timeof the final rule, OSHA will establish a new limit for phenyl glycidylether if the Agency determines that this limit will substantially reducesignificant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">PICRIC ACID </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 88-89-1; Chemical Formula: HOC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>2</T2>(NO<T2>2</T2>)<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH also recommends an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m\3\, aswell as a 15-minute short-term limit of 0.3 mg/m\3\ and a skin notation.Picric acid occurs as colorless to pale yellow, odorless, and intenselybitter crystals. Picric acid and its salts are toxic by ingestion, skin contact, or inhalation,and the substances also have skin-sensitization potential (Schwartz 1944).Available reports concerning human exposures describe edema, papules, vesicles,and desquamations of the face, mouth, and nose (Sunderman, Weidman, andBatson 1945). Systemic poisoning following absorption has been reportedto produce headache, vertigo, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and skin andconjunctival discoloration, as well as discoloration of urine and albuminuria;high-dose exposures caused destruction of erythrocytes and produced gastroenteritis,hemorrhagic nephritis, and acute hepatitis (Sunderman, Weidman, and Batson1945). Occupational exposure to ammonium picrate dust at concentrationsof 0.0088 to 0.1947 mg/m\3\ caused dermatitis only in those workers whowere least exposed; the ACGIH believes that this suggests that desensitizationor adaptation occurs with repeated exposure (ACGIH 1986, p. 490). OSHA proposes an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m\3\, a 15-minute STEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\,and a skin notation for picric acid. The Agency has preliminarily concludedthat these limits will protect exposed workers from the risk of systemicpoisoning resulting from skin absorption and of sensitization caused bycontact with this substance.

The ACGIH has established a ceiling limit of 0.06 mg/m\3\.Subtilisins are proteolytic bacterial enzymes used primarily in laundrydetergents. They are considered a threat to occupational health becausethey cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory allergies in addition toirritation of the skin and respiratory tract (ACGIH 1986; Pepys et al.1969). A report by the California Department of Public Health (1969) showed thatseveral workers were hospitalized after exposure to subtilisins in a detergentformulation plant where the ``safe limit'' was set at 0.12 mg/m\3\. Whetherthis limit was exceeded or the workers failed to wear the protective gearthey were given is unclear. OSHA is proposing a ceiling limit of 0.06 mg/m\3\ for the subtilisins;the incident described above suggests that OSHA's proposal to set a ceilinglimit of 0.06 mg/m\3\ for exposure to subtilisins is appropriate and willreduce the risk of skin irritation, respiratory allergies, and sensitizationin the exposed worker population. The health evidence forms a reasonablebasis for proposing a revision to this level.

No. 1398</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) is 0.02 ppm asa ceiling limit. The ACGIH and NIOSH both recommend a TWA of 0.005 ppmand a STEL of 0.02 ppm. TDI is one of the most frequently encountered sensitizers in the workplace,and is also a known cross-sensitizer. The proposed limit is based on humandata showing that workers can develop sensitization reactions at exposurelevels below the 0.02-ppm ceiling. Elkins et al. (1965) reviewed the incidenceof TDI intoxication in 14 plants in Massachusetts between 1957 and 1962.In eleven instances of TDI intoxication, the average concentration of TDIwas 0.015 ppm, and in nine cases the average concentration was below 0.01ppm. In all plants where the average levels were above 0.01 ppm, TDI hadcaused respiratory problems. TDI-related respiratory problems were notobserved when the average ccncentration of TDI was maintained below 0.007ppm. Williamson conducted two TDI studies (1964, 1965) that revealed a 5-percentsensitization rate in 99 workers exposed for 18 months to levels of TDIaveraging below 0.02 ppm. The author believed that accidental spills accountedfor the high sensitization rate. Williamson also found that six sensitizedworkers out of 18 exposed to concentrations of TDI below 0.02 ppm for 14months showed marked decreases in lung function.A NOEL (no-observed-effect level) for TDI has been documented. In 1975,Roper and Cromer failed to observe any symptoms of respiratory illnessor changes in pulmonary function in nine employees working in a plant wherebreathing zone samples showed TDI concentrations of 0.001 to 0.002 ppm.Wegman et al. (1974, 1977, 1982) observed a dose-response relationshipamong TDI-exposed employees in the long-term decline of lung function,as documented in test results. Only for those workers exposed to less than0.002 ppm TDI were the results of lung function tests normal. In keepingwith these findings, OSHA is proposing a TWA of 0.005-ppm and a STEL of0.02-ppm. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the evidence clearly demonstrates thatworkers are at risk of pulmonary sensitization reactions at the currentPEL, as evidenced by declines in pulmonary function observed among workersexposed below this level. OSHA also believes that establishing a 0.005-ppmTWA with a 0.02-ppm STEL will reduce this risk; TDI-related respiratoryeffects have not generally been observed among workers exposed below 0.01ppm. The health evidence forms a reasonable basis for proposing a revisionto this level. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish a newlimit for toluene-2,4-diisocyanate if the Agency determines that this limitwill substantially reduce significant risk. Preliminary Conclusions For the eight sensitizing agents included in this category of substances,OSHA preliminarily concludes that there are occupational risks associatedwith exposure. The effects caused by such exposures include skin sensitization,substantial decrements in lung function, bronchoconstriction, and severeskin irritation. Reducing or establishing exposure limits for these toxicsubstances will substantially reduce these workplace risks. The health evidence for these sensitizers forms a reasonable basis forproposing revisions to or additions of exposure limits for these substances.At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish new limits or reviseexisting limits if the Agency determines that these limits will substantiallyreduce significant risk. <ITAG tagnum="81">15. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofCancer </ITAG>The ACGIH has established new TLVs or lowered previous TLVs for 17 substancesbased on evidence that occupational exposure may be associated with anincreased cancer risk. Table C15-1 lists the current OSHA permissible exposurelevels (PELs), the ACGIH TLVs, the NIOSH RELs, and the CAS and HS numbersfor these substances. OSHA is proposing to revise existing TWA and/or STELlimits for six substances; retain a PEL for three substances currentlylisted on Table Z-2; adopt NIOSH ceiling limits for two substances; andadd limits for six substances not currently listed on OSHA's Z-tables.The following discussion addresses some general aspects of carcinogenicity,together with the methodology used by OSHA in previous rulemakings to assesscarcinogenic hazards. Two representative substances are reviewed in termsof their effects, dose-response considerations, and quantitative risk assessmentsto evaluate the decrease in risk of developing cancer that is expectedafter revising or establishing PELs for these substances. In this section,quantitative risk models that are widely accepted by the scientific communityare used as a means of estimating cancer risks. The multistage model, whichis the model primarily used by OSHA, is preferred over other models becauseit is based on a more plausible biological mechanism of cancer than theother models. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 759-761 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects Cancer is a life-threatening and particularly insidious disease that isbrought about by the invasion of organ systems by abnormal tissue growth.The abnormal tissue is comprised of cells that have been altered in sucha way as to cause unrestricted cell growth. As this unrestricted growthprogresses, the abnormal tissue begins to interfere with the vital functionsof normal organ systems. In the absence of medical intervention, most formsof cancer are ultimately lethal. In some instances (e.g., colon cancer,breast cancer), life can be prolonged through chemotherapy, radiation treatment,surgery, or some combination of these; however, the quality of life ofthe victims of cancer is usually severely affected. In other instances,such as lung cancer, there is little hope of survival, even when aggressivetreatment strategies are employed. An increased risk of developing cancer has been associated with occupationalor environmental exposure to a number of chemical substances. The developmentof chemically induced cancer in humans and animals is a complex and multi-stepprocess that is not completely understood. It is currently believed thatthe mechanism by which cancer develops requires at least two stages: initiationand promotion. Initiation occurs when chemicals interact either directlyor indirectly with DNA to cause a heritable mutation. Alterations in DNAstructure may cause an incorrect reading of the DNA sequence during replicationand result in more altered cells, which may eventually be expressed asa tumor. There is a correlation between substances that are mutagenic in<T3>in-vitro </T3>test systems and their ability to cause cancer. Althoughgenotoxic assays are not capable of predicting carcinogenic potential withcertainty, such assays are useful for the preliminary identification ofsubstances that may have the potential to cause cancer. The second stage in the carcinogenic process is promotion. Promotion isconsidered to be the likely mechanism of action when there is no evidencethat a substance interacts with genetic material, e.g., when <T3>in-vitro </T3>mutagenicity assays are negative. Peroxisome proliferation,immunosuppression, and hormonal alterations are examples of promotionalevents; these events facilitate the unrestricted multiplication of initiatedcells, leading to the development of cancer. When a substance or its metabolitepossesses both initiation and promotion capabilities, it is consideredto be a complete carcinogen, i.e., exposure to the substance alone is sufficientto cause cancer. Examples of such substances that OSHA has recently regulatedinclude asbestos, benzene, ethylene oxide, and formaldehyde.In all of OSHA's past rulemakings for carcinogens, the Agency has useda weight-of-evidence approach to assess the carcinogenic potential of chemicalsubstances. This approach involves examining all available human epidemiologicstudies, clinical and case studies, animal studies, mutagenicity studies,and metabolic studies, combined with a quantitative assessment of cancerrisk, to make determinations regarding the potential that occupationalexposure to a substance increases the risk of cancer. OSHA relies mostheavily on epidemiologic studies of worker populations and well-conductedanimal bioassays to make these determinations. OSHA's overall approachto promulgating regulations for carcinogens has been upheld in a numberof Court decisions. The following discussion summarizes how epidemiologic and animal studiesare used to assess cancer risk. <T3>Epidemiology studies. </T3>Epidemiological studies that include detailedexposure data provide the best evidence for describing a causal relationshipbetween exposure to a substance and the onset of cancer in humans. Epidemiologicevidence has been relied on heavily in OSHA's decisions to promulgate standardsfor the carcinogens benzene, asbestos, and arsenic. At a minimum, positiveepidemiologic studies provide qualitative proof of a causal relationshipbetween exposure to a substance and the development of cancer. A generallack of quantitative exposure data and the long latencies between onsetof exposure and appearance of disease may make it difficult to derive quantitativedose-response relationships from epidemiological studies. However, theability of such studies to link exposures to carcinogens to cancer in humansoutweighs these limitations. Because of the long latency periods associated with chemically inducedcancer in humans, these studies cannot be used to detect disease untilafter irreparable harm has been done. To protect workers or other humanpopulations, therefore, it is necessary to assess the risks of such effectsbefore they occur. The data used for this purpose derive from animal bioassays;these data are used to predict potential human responses and to infer acausal relationship between exposure to a substance and the onset of disease.<T3>Animal data. </T3>Animal studies frequently provide the best dose-responsedata for chemically induced cancer. When relying on such studies, assumptionsmust be made in order to extrapolate from animal bioassay data to humans;the most important of these are that physiologic, pharmacokinetic, andbiochemical parameters are similar between mammalian species. To the extentthat adequate metabolic data are available, such data may be used to refinethe extrapolation from animals to humans. Despite the need to make suchassumptions, it is widely accepted that animals are acceptable surrogatesfor estimating potential cancer risks in humans. This confidence derivesfrom the observation, after many years of conducting bioassay studies,that there appears to be a reasonable concordance between carcinogeniceffects in animals and these effects in humans. Dose-Response and Quantitative Assessment of Risk Unlike other chemically induced toxic effects discussed in this preamble,a large body of scientific knowledge has accumulated regarding the mechanismsby which carcinogens act and the quantitative relationship between doseand biological response. As a result of these investigations, several mathematicalapproaches have been developed that permit estimates to be made of thecancer risk that is associated with exposure to low doses of carcinogenicsubstances. Since the dominant view of the carcinogenic process holds that most cancerinitiators cause irreversible damage to DNA, there is reason to assumethat the dose-response of most carcinogens will follow a linear, non-thresholdrelationship. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP 1985) recommendsthe use of models that incorporate low-dose linearity when the data arelimited and uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms of carcinogenicaction. In conducting risk assessments for prior rulemakings, OSHA hasgenerally relied on the linearized multistage model. The multistage model used to assess cancer risks associated with exposureto substances in this group is GLOBAL83, a model developed by K.S. Crumpand colleagues. If P(d) represents the lifetime risk of cancer at dosed, and A(d) is the extra risk over the background rate at dose d, thenthe multistage model has the following form:<ITAG tagnum="24">A(d)=1^exp[^(q</ITAG><T2>1</T2>d+q<T2>2</T2>d\2\+...+q<T2>k</T2>dk)] <ITAG tagnum="26">where </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">q</ITAG><T2>i</T2>andgreater;0 <ITAG tagnum="14">i=1,2,3,...,k </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">and A(d)=[P(d)^P(0)]/[1^P(0)]</ITAG>For a unique set of q<T2>i</T2>, this function will adequately describe (or fit) the experimentallyderived data. How well the model describes the data may be mathematicallydetermined by what are termed goodness-of-fit tests. Once the model isfit to the data, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the 95 percentupper confidence limit (UCL) of A(d) are calculated using the 95 percentupper confidence limit on parameter q<T2>1 </T2>(q<T2>1</T2>*). The MLE is the point estimate of A(d), and is therefore consideredthe best estimate of extra risk at dose d. The following discusses the carcinogenicity evidence for the chemicalslisted in Table C15-1. A brief discussion of the data and a quantitativerisk assessment (where appropriate) are included to demonstrate the reductionin cancer risk that could result from lowering the current OSHA PELs forthese potential carcinogens.<ITAG tagnum="26">ACRYLAMIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-06-1; Chemical formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCONH<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1008</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for acrylamide is an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\.The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 0.03 mg/m\3\ for acrylamide basedon the increased incidence of cancer seen in laboratory animals chronicallyexposed to acrylamide (Johnson et al. 1986; Bull et al. 1984). Acrylamidehas been classified by the ACGIH as a suspected human carcinogen (A2).Acrylamide is commonly used as a reactive monomer or intermediate in organicsyntheses. Polyacrylamide is a polymer used in the manufacture of adhesives,fibers, paper sizing, molded parts, water coagulant aids, and textiles(ACGIH 1986, p. 12). Past industrial experience and several animal studies have demonstratedthat chronic exposure to acrylamide has clinically significant neurotoxiceffects (ACGIH 1986, p. 12). In fact, the original ACGIH recommendationof 0.3 mg/m\3\ as a TWA was intended to protect workers against centralnervous system toxicity. Assays of acrylamide mutagenicity in <T3>S. typhimurium </T3>were negative, with or without microsomal activation(Bull et al. 1984: Miller et al. 1984). However, subchronic exposure to75 mg acrylamide/kg/day in the diet caused chromosome breaks and aberrationsin spermatogonia in mice (Shiraishi 1978). Furthermore, Smith et al. (1985)found that females mated with male rats that had been given 30 or 60 mgacrylamide/liter in drinking water suffered a significantly increased incidenceof post-implantation loss. Litters sired by males exposed to 60 mg/L hada significant increase in pre-implantation loss. The authors concludedthat acrylamide produces dominant lethality in the male rat (Smith et al.1985). No data are available at the present time on the carcinogenic effects ofacrylamide exposure in humans. The evidence that acrylamide causes cancerin experimental animals is described in two studies, Bull et al. (1984)and Johnson et al. (1986). Bull et al. (1984) tested acrylamide as a skintumor initiator in female Sencar mice, using 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate(TPA) as a promoter. Acrylamide was administered 6 times during a 2-weekperiod in doses ranging from 0 to 50 mg/kg body weight. Tumor incidenceincreased in a dose-related manner, regardless of whether the route ofexposure was gastric intubation, i.p. injection, or topical application.The systemic routes of exposure were the most effective. A dose-responserelationship was also observed in the induction of lung adenomas in bothsexes of A/J mice exposed to acrylamide by either gastric intubation ori.p. injection. These mice were exposed to doses of acrylamide rangingfrom 0 to 25 mg/kg body weight 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Johnson et al. (1986) exposed male and female Fischer 344 rats to acrylamidein drinking water for 2 years. Doses ranged from 0 to 2.0 mg acrylamide/kgbody weight/day. A statistically significant increase in mortality causedby cancer was observed at the highest dose level during the last 4 monthsof the study. The incidences of several types of tumors in both sexes werealso significantly increased at this dosage. In females, the more frequentlyobserved tumor types were tumors of the mammary gland, central nervoussystem, thyroid gland (follicular epithelium), oral tissues, uterus, andclitoral gland. In males, increased incidences of tumors in the centralnervous system, thyroid gland, and scrotum were observed. <T3>Risk estimate for acrylamide. </T3>For the EPA, Crump et al. (1987)performed a risk assessment for acrylamide, derived in part from the resultsof the Johnson et al. study (1986). For the purposes of risk assessment,the incidences of certain tumors in female rats were pooled: tumors ofthe mammary gland, brain and spinal cord, thyroid gland, uterus, and oralcavity. The Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) and Upper Confidence Limits(UCLs) for the current and proposed exposure limits are presented in TableC15-2. GLOBAL 83, a multistage model developed by K.S. Crump, was usedto predict these risks. The risk estimate shows that, at OSHA's currentPEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\, the excess risk of death from cancer for workers exposedover their working lifetimes is 10 per 1,000 workers. At the proposed PELof 0.03 mg/m\3\, this number would be reduced to 1 per 1,000 exposed workers.OSHA preliminarily concludes, based on the results of the quantitativerisk estimate shown in Table C15-2, that the risks of cancer posed to workersat the current PEL are clearly significant. The Agency finds that reducingthe exposure limit to the proposed 0.03 mg/m\3\ level will reduce thissignificant risk by a factor of 10, to 1 per 1,000 workers, which is consistentwith the Supreme Court's guidance in the<T3> Benzene</T3> decision. OSHA therefore proposes to lower the 8-hourTWA PEL to 0.03 mg/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table C</T4>15-2._<T4>Multistage Model Estimates of Cancer Risk Associated With Working LifetimeExposure to Acrylamide  </T4><H1>Exposure level </H1><H1>Excess cancer deaths per 1,000 workers </H1><H2>MLE </H2><H2>UCL</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">0.3 mg/m\3\a <D>10 </D><D>45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">0.03 mg/m\3\b <D>1 </D><D>5  </D><F/>a Current OSHA PEL. <F/>b Proposed PEL. <F>MLE=Maximum likelihood estimate of risk. </F><F>UCL=95 percent upper confidence limit on maximum likelihood estimateof risk.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">AMITROLE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 61-82-5: Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>4</T2>N<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1020</ITAG>Amitrole is used as an herbicide and plant growth regulator. There is nocurrent OSHA PEL for amitrole. OSHA proposes a TWA limit of 0.2 mg/m\3\,the same limit recommended by the ACGIH, based on positive carcinogenicitystudies conducted in rats and mice. NIOSH recommends a 10-hour TWA of 0.3mg/m\3\ for amitrole. Amitrole is a potent anti-thyroid agent and has been shown to cause tumors,particularly of the thyroid and pituitary glands, in experimental animals(ACGIH 1986, p. 25). Its tumor-producing activity is thought to be relatedto its goitrogenic effects, which cause an increase in thyroid stimulatinghormone (TSH). Other antithyroid agents that cause TSH stimulation, suchas propylthiouracil, have also been shown to produce thyroid tumors (Guyton1981). Amitrole has not been shown to be mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutationassay, a dominant lethal test in male mice, or in assays that measure recessivesex-linked lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster (ACGIH 1986, p.25). An excess incidence of tumors has been reported to occur among pesticideworkers exposed to amitrole alone and in combination with phenoxy herbicides.Although these studies indicate the possible association of increased tumorincidence with exposure to amitrole, confounding factors, such as smokingand concurrent exposure to other pesticides, complicate interpretationof these data. The Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health ordered anepidemiological evaluation to assess the incidence of cancer among railroadworkers exposed to herbicides (Axelson and Sundell 1974). Amitrole wasamong the pesticides utilized by these workers. Cohorts were separatedinto groups according to whether they were exposed to amitrole and combinationsof other herbicides, phenoxy acids and combinations of other herbicides,or other herbicides alone. A statistically significant increase in theincidence of total tumors and lung tumors was found among workers exposedto amitrole and combinations of other herbicides. Smoking frequency amongmembers of this group was reported to be similar to the frequency of smokingin the general Swedish population. In a 1980 follow-up to Axelson and Sundell (1974), Axelson and co-workerscombined data from the earlier study with data on workers exposed from1972 to 1978. Cohorts were divided into the following exposure groups:Amitrole alone, phenoxy acids alone, and amitrole and phenoxy acids combined.The reanalyzed data did not show a statistically significant increase incancer incidence among the workers exposed to amitrole alone; however,the incidence of tumors among workers exposed to amitrole and phenoxy acidstogether was significantly increased. Amitrole has been found to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals followingdietary exposure to relatively high doses. Attempts to induce tumors bydermal application and subcutaneous injection have been unsuccessful. Studiesinvestigating the carcinogenic potential of amitrole in laboratory animalsare reviewed below. The inhibitory effects of amitrole on the productionof liver tumors induced by 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene are also discussed.The effects of lifetime exposure to amitrole were investigated in rats,mice, and hamsters fed diets containing 1, 10, or 100 ppm amitrole (Steinhoffet al. 1983). There was a significant increase in the incidence of thyroidtumors in male and female rats and in the incidence of pituitary tumorsin female rats exposed to 100 ppm. An excess incidence of tumors was notfound in male or female rats exposed to 1 or 10 ppm. The results of thisexperiment are presented in Table C15-3. Tumor induction was not observedin male or female mice or hamsters. Another study reported negative resultsfor rats fed diets containing 10, 50, or 100 ppm amitrole (Jukes and Schaffer1960). Dermal applications of 0.1 or 10 mg of amitrole produced no increased incidenceof tumors in mice (IARC 1974). In contrast to the negative results obtained in mice following lifetimedietary exposure to 1, 10, or 100 ppm amitrole (Steinhoff et al. 1983),positive results were observed in male and female mice following dietaryexposure to higher levels (2192 ppm) of amitrole for 1 year (Innes et al.1969). Carcinomas of the thyroid were observed in 89 percent (64/72) ofthe exposed animals (tumor incidence in controls is not reported). <G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus Table 773 </ITAG>Positive results were also observed in mice exposed to 1 percent (10,000ppm) amitrole in the diet (duration of exposure not indicated; Feinsteinet al. 1978). Liver tumors developed in 7 percent of the exposed mice;however, the incidence of tumors in unexposed controls was not reported.A small number of thyroid tumors was also reported. The authors hypothesizedthat the reason more thyroid tumors were not seen was because the animalsdied of the high toxic doses before such tumors were expressed. Chronic dietary administration of amitrole in dogs (10, 50, 100, or 500ppm) and in rainbow trout (1200 or 4800 ppm) did not result in the developmentof tumors (IARC 1974).<T3>Risk estimate for amitrole. </T3>The study by Steinhoff et al. (1983)provides sufficient information to estimate quantitatively the excess cancerrisk associated with exposure to amitrole in the workplace. The linearizedmultistage model was chosen to estimate risk. The incidence of malignantthyroid tumors in female rats was used because these tumors demonstratea clear monotonic response. Female rats were assumed to weigh 250 g andto consume 25 g of food per day. Human risks were estimated at exposurelevels corresponding to the proposed PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\, as well as forexposure levels of 0.4 mg/m\3\ and 1.0 mg/m\3\. The excess estimated cancerrisk, in terms of excess deaths per 1000 employees, is shown in Table C15-4.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. table 774 </ITAG>Exposure to 0.2 mg/m\3\ of amitrole for an occupational lifetime (45 years)is associated with an estimated 13 excess cancer deaths per thousand employees(1.3 percent). This rate is based on the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).The 95-percent upper-bound estimate of risk corresponding to this doseis 17 excess cancer deaths per 1,000. By comparison, the maximum likelihoodestimates of risk for lifetime exposure to 0.4 mg/m\3\ or 1.0 mg/m\3\ are26 or 65 excess deaths per 1,000 employees, respectively. Exposure to amitrole has been shown to be associated with an increasedincidence of thyroid and pituitary tumors in experimental animals. Althoughhuman studies have not demonstrated conclusively that amitrole is carcinogenic,the studies by Axelson and Sundell (1974) and Axelson et al. (1980) provideevidence that amitrole may increase cancer risk among exposed workers.OSHA's risk assessment, based on the animal data, shows that this significantexcess cancer risk can be substantially reduced for employees who are currentlyexposed above the proposed 0.2 mg/m\3\ limit. Therefore, OSHA is proposingto establish a 0.2 mg/m\3\ TWA exposure limit for amitrole.<ITAG tagnum="26">ASPHALT FUMES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8052-42-4; Chemical formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1028</ITAG>There is no current OSHA PEL for asphalt fumes. The ACGIH recommends aTLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\, based on asphalt's ability to induce skin tumorsin mice. NIOSH recommends a ceiling (15 minutes) of 5 mg/m\3\ for asphaltfumes, measured as total particulates. Asphalt, also called bitumen, is a mixture of hydrocarbons that is producedby the evaporation of the lighter hydrocarbons from petroleum distillationand subsequent partial oxidation of the residue. Occupational exposureto asphalt fumes can occur during its manufacture or as a result of thesecondary heating of asphalt in processes such as road building, roofing,and the coating of construction metals (Thayer et al. 1981). Asphalt isconsidered a potential carcinogen because of its physical and chemicalsimilarity to coal tar pitch, a recognized human carcinogen. (Benz(a)pyrene(BaP), which is found in coal tar pitch, is a known carcinogen that hasbeen regulated by OSHA in a 6(b) rulemaking.) The process of manufacturing asphalts or bitumens removes many of the lowermolecular weight compounds that have low boiling points, including PAHswith 3 to 7 rings. Therefore, the amount of BaP in asphalt is lower thanthe amount in coal tar pitch. The mutagenicity data on asphalt are limited. Claxton and Hufsingh (1980)and Lewtas (1981, 1983) reported positive results for extracts of roofingtar fumes in the Ames <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>assay. Penalva et al. (1983) also reportedthat an extract of asphalt was mutagenic in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>in the presence of biological activationby cytochrome P<T2>450</T2>. The vapors, particles, and aerosols of this substance wereweakly mutagenic in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium, </T3>both in the presence and the absence ofbiological activation. Several studies of the carcinogenicity of asphalt have been conducted.Four studies reported negative results (Hueper and Payne 1960; Wallcaveet al. 1972; Bingham et al. 1980; and Emmett et al. 1981), and three studiesreported positive results (Simmers 1965, 1966; Thayer et al. 1981). Thesestudies are summarized below. Four studies have reported findings on the carcinogenicity of asphalt byskin painting. Thayer et al. (1981) reported positive tumorigenic activitywhen two different types of condensates from roofing asphalt volatilesand two types of condensates from coal tar pitch volatiles were testedat two temperatures, 232 and 316 degrees F.Groups of CD-1 and CH3/HeJ mice were treated with one of the four typesof asphalt condensates or one of the four types of coal tar pitch condensates.The mice treated with asphalt received a 25-mg dose of the condensate twiceweekly for 18 months. The mice treated with coal tar solids received adose of 1.5 to 4.2 mg of the condensate (0.15 andCx.18;g and 0.45 andCx.18;gBaP, respectively) twice weekly for 18 months. In addition to these treatments,separate groups of mice were treated with the asphalt or coal tar preparationsplus ultraviolet light (UVL). CH3/HeJ mice were more sensitive than the CD-1 mice, with nearly 100 percentof the CH3/HeJ mice and about half of the CD-1 mice developing skin papillomas.UVL decreased the carcinogenic response in all test groups. Also, the asphaltvolatiles prepared at the higher temperature produced a greater response.Although Thayer et al. (1981) report a statistically significant increasein the incidence of skin tumors, it is difficult to estimate quantitativelythe cancer risk from these data because of the lower reliability of theestimate of q<T2>1 </T2>(the slope of the dose-response curve) determined from dataproviding one dose level and a 100-percent tumorigenic response. An additional skin painting study (Simmers 1965) supports the results ofThayer et al. (1981). However, in the Simmers study (1965), the asphaltwas applied in a solution containing benzene, a human carcinogen. There is conflicting evidence concerning the carcinogenicity of asphaltfollowing dermal application and inhalation exposure. Hueper and Payne(1960), Wallcave et al. (1971), Bingham et al. (1980), and Emmett et al.(1981) reported negative results by skin painting. Hueper and Payne (1960)also reported negative results when guinea pigs and rats were exposed toasphalt fumes by inhalation. A positive carcinogenic response was reported by Simmers (1966) and byHueper and Payne (1960) when rats and mice were exposed to asphalt by injection.Studies by Hammond et al. (1976), Menck and Henderson (1976), and Milham(1982) reported increased standardized mortality ratios or proportionatemortality ratios for lung cancer among roofers and slaters. It is difficultto show a definite association between asphalt exposure and lung cancerbecause most people who work with asphalt have concomitant exposure tocoal tars (Hammond et al. 1976). A survey by Baylor and Weaver (1968) reported no significant differencesin the health of 462 asphalt workers, compared with the health of controls.These workers had asphalt exposures for a period of at least 5 years andwere then given a physical examination, which included a medical and occupationalhistory. Additional information was obtained by questionnaire from pavingcompanies, roofing manufacturers, and truck operators. No adverse healtheffects were reported in this survey (Baylor and Weaver 1968). However,without mortality data and a longer period of follow-up, no firm conclusionscan be drawn from these studies. Asphalt's ability to induce skin tumors directly in mice and rats demonstratesthis substance's potential carcinogenicity. Exposures to asphalt fumesshould also be reduced because these fumes contain benzo(a)pyrene. BaPis present in coal tar and is the constituent primarily responsible forthe high carcinogenic risk associated with exposure to coal tar pitch.OSHA considered the possibility of performing a quantitative risk assessmentfor asphalt and concluded that the studies described above did not havesufficient dose-response data to provide an adequate basis for such a riskassessment. OSHA preliminarily concludes that workers exposed at the currentunregulated level are at significant risk of cancer. The Agency believesthat establishing a limit of 5 mg/m\3\ for daily exposure to asphalt fumeswill substantially reduce this significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">BERYLLIUM AND COMPOUNDS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No.: 7440-41-7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1033</ITAG>OSHA's current limits for beryllium are 0.002 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA,0.005 mg/m\3\ as a ceiling, and 0.025 mg/m\3\ as a 30-minute peak. TheACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 0.002 mg/m\3\. NIOSH (1977) has recommendeda ceiling limit of 0.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (0.0005 mg/m\3\). The ACGIH recommendation is based on human evidence describing non-malignantrespiratory disease and berylliosis associated with exposure to beryllium.Because of the uncertainty regarding the minimal concentrations of berylliumnecessary to produce chronic respiratory disease, and because of the seriousnature of the disease, ACGIH recommended a TLV-TWA of 0.002 mg/m\3\. At the time of publication of NIOSH's 1972 criteria document on beryllium,NIOSH judged the evidence on beryllium-related cancer to be equivocal.In testimony at OSHA's 1977 hearing on a standard for beryllium, NIOSHpresented additional epidemiologic and animal evidence indicating thatberyllium is carcinogenic. In particular, NIOSH cited the studies of Baylissand Wagoner (1977) and Mancuso (personal communication, 1977) showing significantincreases in bronchogenic cancer among beryllium-exposed workers. NIOSHtherefore recommended that exposure to beryllium not exceed the reliablelimit of detection of 0.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\. The ACGIH TLV of 0.002 mg/m\3\ (TWA) is less stringent than OSHA's existingPELs. The NIOSH REL is based on analytical and sampling limits of detection,which do not necessarily satisfy OSHA's requirements regarding significantrisk and feasibility. To consider the carcinogenic effects of beryllium,OSHA would have to perform a quantitative risk assessment, which couldnot be completed in time for this rulemaking. In light of these facts,OSHA proposes to maintain the Agency's existing PELs of 0.002 mg/m\3\ TWA,0.005 mg/m\3\ as a 30-minute ceiling, and 0.025 mg/m\3\ as a peak.<ITAG tagnum="26">CARBON TETRACHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 56-23-5; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>4 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has established a5 ppm 8-hour TWA limit, with a skin notation. A 60-minute limit of 2 ppmhas been recommended by NIOSH (1977); this limit reflects the lowest reliablydetectable airborne concentration at the time that the recommendation wasmade. Carbon tetrachloride is classified as a probable human carcinogenby EPA (group B2) and IARC (group 2B) and as a suspected human carcinogenby ACGIH (category A2), based on positive carcinogenicity studies in rats,mice, and hamsters.In humans, there have been three case reports of liver tumors developingafter carbon tetrachloride exposure (Tracey and Sherlock 1968; Johnstone1948; Simler et al. 1964). In each case, the patient had been acutely overexposedto carbon tetrachloride, leading to nausea, stomach pains, and signs ofsevere liver damage. Blair et al. (1979) studied causes of death in 330 laundry and dry cleaningworkers potentially exposed to carbon tetrachloride, as well as to trichloroethyleneand tetrachloroethylene. Causes of death based on death certificates werecompared to the age, sex, race, and cause-specific distribution of U.S.deaths from the same time period. The proportionate mortality ratio (PMR)for all malignant neoplasms was 128, which was statistically significant,indicating that the study group had a 28 percent higher proportion of totaldeaths due to cancer compared with the U.S. general population. The excesscancer deaths were due to liver, lung, and cervical cancer and leukemia.Although the excess lung and cervical cancer may reflect socioeconomicdifferences among these workers, the excess liver cancer seen in this studyis consistent with findings in animal studies on carbon tetrachloride.In animals, carbon tetrachloride has produced hepatocellular carcinomasin all species evaluated (rats, mice, and hamsters). Male rats were given47 or 94 mg/kg carbon tetrachloride and females were given 80 or 159 mg/kgby gavage for 78 weeks (NCI 1976a,b; 1977). The incidence of hepatocellularcarcinomas was increased in animals exposed to carbon tetrachloride ascompared with pooled colony controls but was statistically significantonly for low-dose females. The lower incidence of carcinomas in femalerats at the high dose (1/49) compared to the low-dose (4/49) was attributedby the authors to the increased lethality that occurred among these ratsbefore tumors could be expressed. In this same study, mice of both sexes received 1250 or 2500 mg/kg carbontetrachloride by gavage. Hepatocellular carcinomas were found in 49/49low-dose and 47/48 high-dose males (compared with 5/77 in the control males)and in 40/40 low-dose and 43/45 high-dose females (compared with 1/80 inthe control females) (NCI 1976a,b; 1977). Edwards et al. (1942) administered carbon tetrachloride by gavage to amouse strain known to have a low incidence of spontaneous hepatomas. Theincidence of hepatomas was 52 percent (28/54) for males and 32 percent(6/19) for females. Previous hepatoma incidence data for untreated miceof this strain were 2/71 for males and 0/81 for females. Carbon tetrachlorideadministered by gavage has also been shown to produce neoplastic changesin the livers of four additional strains of mice (Andervont 1958; Edwards1941; Eschenbrenner and Miller 1943). Della Porta et al. (1961) gave weekly gavage treatments to hamsters for30 weeks, and the animals were observed for an additional 25 weeks. All10 hamsters dying or killed between weeks 43 and 55 had liver cell carcinomas,in comparison with 0/254 in historical controls. <T3>Risk estimate for carbon tetrachloride.</T3> Four data sets have sufficientdose response information to allow quantitative risk estimation: The ratand mouse bioassay data (NCI 1976a, 1976b, 1977); the Edwards et al. (1942)mouse data; and the Della Porta et al. (1961) hamster data. In order toincrease sample sizes, the data for male and female animals in each ofthe studies were pooled. The estimated risk presented in Table C15-11 isthe geometric mean of the risk calculated from each data set. Inhalation risk was calculated assuming an air intake of 20 m\3\ per 24-hourday and a 40 percent absorption rate for humans (U.S. EPA 1984). All fourstudies suggest that a common biological mechanism, cell death and regeneration,occurs and leads to the development of the same tumor type. Table C15-11 presents the estimates of lifetime human risk from carbontetrachloride exposure, calculated by the linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83),at the proposed 2 ppm limit, the ACGIH limit of 5 ppm, and the current10 ppm OSHA PEL. Both the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and the 95percent upper confidence limits of human risk are given, as well as thecorresponding expected number of excess cancer deaths per 1,000 exposedover a working lifetime.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. table 783</ITAG>Based on this risk estimate, the MLE at the current OSHA limit of 10 ppmis 17.9 excess deaths per 1000 exposed workers, clearly indicating thata significant cancer risk exists at the current PEL. Risk at the current ACGIH limit of 5 ppm is estimated to be 9.2 excessdeaths per 1000 workers exposed over their working lifetimes. At the proposedlimit of 2 ppm, residual risk continues to be significant, according tothe Supreme Court's guidance in the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision; the risk predicted at 2 ppm is 3.7 excess deathsfor 1000 workers exposed over their working lifetimes. However, risk atthe 2 ppm limit is substantially reduced compared with risk at the currentOSHA PEL of 10 ppm. The estimate shows that approximately 14 cancer deathswould potentially be avoided by reducing the limit to 2 ppm. However, becausethe 2 ppm limit was set by NIOSH on the basis of the limits for the samplingand analytical method available at the time this 60-minute PEL was recommended.OSHA solicits comments on the technological feasibility of the proposedlimit.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHLOROFORM </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-66-3; Chemical Formula: CHCl<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1086</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for chloroform is 50 ppm as a ceiling limit. The ACGIHhas established a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and assigned chloroform an A2 designation.NIOSH (1977) recommends that workplace exposures not exceed 2 ppm as detectedby a 60 minute sample; this limit represented the limit of detection atthe time NIOSH made the recommendation.Chloroform is considered to be a probable carcinogen in humans by the ACGIHand the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and InternationalAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Chloroform is given an overall weight-of-evidenceclassification of B2 by the EPA, and an IARC classification of 2B. Theseclassifications are based on sufficient animal evidence for carcinogenicityand insufficient epidemiological evidence to reach a conclusion based onthe human data. The following discussion is based on information from theEPA Health Assessment Document for chloroform (U.S. EPA 1985). It is currently believed that the carcinogenicity of chloroform resultsfrom the formation of reactive metabolites, such as phosgene, that bindto cellular macromolecules. Although there is some evidence to suggestthat chloroform is weakly mutagenic, the results of most mutagenicity testsare negative. In humans, there are no epidemiological studies that evaluate populationsexposed only to chloroform, although there are several studies that examinepopulations exposed to chloroform in chlorinated drinking water. However,because chloroform is not the only potential carcinogen present in chlorinatedwater, the epidemiological data are considered inadequate to use as thebasis for a quantitative risk assessment. Thus, a causal relationship betweencancer and chloroform exposure cannot be determined based on epidemiologicalstudies alone, although these studies can be used to provide general supportfor findings in animal studies. A case-controlled study indicates a significant association between coloncancer and exposure to chlorinated drinking water contaminated with organicmaterial (Young et al. 1981). Significant positive associations were alsofound for chloroform levels in drinking water and the incidence of mortalitydue to cancer of the bladder, rectum, and large intestine (Hogan et al.1979). Similar results also have been found by others (Cantor et al. 1978and Gottlieb et al. 1981). However, although these studies suggest an associationbetween exposure to chloroform and an increased risk of cancer, a definitecausal relationship between the development of colon and bladder cancerand exposure to chloroform cannot be determined solely from these studies.In animals, several long-term studies provide strong evidence for the carcinogenicactivity of chloroform. Chloroform has been shown to produce statisticallysignificant increases in renal epithelial tumors in male rats and hepatocellularcarcinomas in several strains of mice. The carcinogenic activity of chloroformin these studies is specific to the kidney and liver. The carcinogenic activity of chloroform was investigated in rats exposedto chloroform by gavage for 78 weeks (NCI 1976). Male rats were administereddoses of 90 or 180 mg/kg/day, and female rats were administered doses of100 or 200 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant dose-related increasein renal epithelial tumors was observed in treated male rats compared withuntreated, matched controls; these tumors were described as carcinomasand adenomas. No increase in the incidence of tumors was observed in chloroform-treatedfemale rats. In this same study, the carcinogenicity of chloroform was evaluated inmice exposed chronically to chloroform by gavage (NCI 1976). Male micewere exposed to doses of 138 or 277 mg/kg/day and females to 238 or 477mg/kg/day for 78 weeks. There were significant dose-related increases inthe incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in chloroform-treated male andfemale mice. The increase of tumors in male mice for low and high doseswas 36 percent and 98 percent, respectively. For female mice, the increaseswere 80 percent for the low dose and 95 percent for the high dose of chloroform.The carcinogenic potential of chloroform in mice was further investigatedin two additional studies (Roe et al. 1979; Jorgenson et al. 1985). Dosesof 17, 60, or 100 mg/kg/day were administered to four different strainsof male and female mice (C57BL, CBA, CF/1, and ICI) by gavage for 80 weeks(Roe et al. 1979). The incidence of kidney tumors, described as hypernephromas,was significantly elevated in the ICI strain. Moderate to severe renalchanges were observed in the male mice of the other strains, but no significantincrease in renal tumors was reported. Tumors were not observed in femalemice. The carcinogenicity of chloroform administered in drinking water was investigatedin male rats and female mice (Jorgenson et al. 1985). Animals were treatedwith drinking water containing chloroform concentrations of 200, 400, 900,or 1800 mg/L for 104 weeks. There was a marked increase in the number ofkidney tumors (described as tubular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas)in rats. However, the incidence of tumors in female mice was not significantlyincreased. <T3>Risk estimate for chloroform. </T3>The NCI (1976) rat study, whichdemonstrated a statistically significant increase in the incidence of renaltumors in male rats, was the data set used for the quantitative risk estimation.Although there are no data concerning the carcinogenicity of chloroformfollowing inhalation exposure, the risk from inhaled chloroform is consideredto be equivalent to the risk from ingested chloroform. The linearized multistage,one hit, and Weibull models were used. The maximum likelihood estimatesof excess cancers over an occupational lifetime for a population of 1000and the 95 percent upper bound estimates are summarized in Table C15-12.The Weibull model is similar to the logit and probit models. However, byusing only one data set, the logit, probit, and multihit models failedto converge. The results of the data analysis presented here are similar to the resultsof other models described by the EPA (1985) for chloroform. These threemodels clearly demonstrate, based on the MLE estimates, that a significantcancer risk exists at the current PEL of 50 ppm. The risks estimated toexist at the current PEL are of the same order of magnitude as the risksdetermined by OSHA to be associated with other carcinogens that OSHA hasregulated (e.g., benzene, ethylene oxide). Therefore, OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that a significant risk of cancer exists at the current PEL of50 ppm, with estimated risks ranging from 9 to 32 excess deaths per 1,000workers. The Supreme Court indicates that a reasonable person ``might wellconsider a risk of 1.0 per 1000 significant, and take steps to decreaseor eliminate that risk'' (<T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I., </T3>448 U.S. 655). OSHA also preliminarily finds that revisingthe PEL to 2 ppm will substantially reduce this risk by from 92 to 99 percent.Therefore, OSHA is proposing a 2 ppm short-term limit (15 minutes) as thePEL. OSHA's preliminary feasibility analysis is based on limited data atthis level, and the Agency accordingly requests additional feasibilityinformation from the public.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert Illus.

No. 1092; 1436</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for chromic acid and chromates is a ceiling limitof 0.1 mg/m\3\ measured as CrO<T2>3</T2>. The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\ as Cr(VI)for both the soluble and insoluble forms of chromate (except zinc chromate),and has designated insoluble chromates as confirmed human carcinogens (Al).NIOSH (1975) has recommended that exposure to the noncarcinogenic formsof chromium (VI) be limited to 0.025 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\ as a 10-hour TWA and0.05 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\ as a 15-minute ceiling. For the carcinogenic (i.e.,insoluble) forms of chromium (VI), NIOSH recommends a 10-hour TWA limitof 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\.The ACGIH recommendation for both soluble (noncarcinogenic) and insoluble(carcinogenic) forms of Cr(VI) is based largely on reports by Bloomfieldand Blum (1928) and by the U.S. Public Health Service (1953) that demonstratenasal irritation and some evidence of liver enlargement and kidney dysfunctionamong chromate workers exposed to 0.06 to 0.07 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\. The ACGIHalso cites a report by Mancuso and Hueper (1951) of excess lung canceramong chromate workers exposed to 0.01 to 0.15 mg/m\3\ soluble chromateand 0.1 to 0.58 mg/m\3\ insoluble chromate. Animal data cited by the ACGIHindicate that insoluble chromate salts were likely to have been responsiblefor the increased incidence of cancer seen in the Mancuso and Hueper study.The ACGIH (1986) concluded that the 0.05 mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA would protectworkers from chromium-induced nasal irritation and possible liver or kidneydamage, and, in the case of the insoluble chromates, would provide an adequatemargin of safety from respiratory cancer. (It should be noted that the0.05 mg/m\3\ limit, expressed as Cr(VI), approximates 0.01 mg/m\3\ measuredas CrO<T2>3</T2>.) NIOSH (1975) cited several studies showing inflammation and ulcerationof the nasal cavity at short-term exposure levels greater than 0.1 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m\3\. In its 1973 Criteria Document on chromic acid, NIOSH recommendedthat the current OSHA ceiling limit (0.1 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m\3\) be supplemented with an 0.05 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m\3\ 10-hour TWA limit. In its 1975 Criteria Document on chromium(VI), NIOSH reaffirmed these limits but extended their application to allforms of noncarcinogenic chromate. Thus, the 0.1 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m\3\ ceiling limit corresponds to a 0.05 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\ ceilinglimit, and the 0.05 mg CrO<T2>3 </T2>TWA limit corresponds to a 0.025 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\ TWA. For thecarcinogenic (insoluble) forms of Cr(VI), NIOSH recommends the lowest detectablelevel, which is 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m\3\ as a 10-hour TWA. Zinc chromate is an insoluble, carcinogenic form of chromate. As such,the current OSHA limit for chromic acid and chromates applies, as doesthe NIOSH limit of 0.001 mg/m\3\ limit for carcinogenic chromates. TheACGIH (1986) reviewed several small epidemiologic studies of zinc chromateworkers, all of which reported excesses of lung cancer. Because of theconsistent evidence, the ACGIH (1986) classified zinc chromate as a confirmedhuman carcinogen (Al) and reduced the TLV to 0.05 mg Cr(VI)m\3\. Evaluation of the alternate recommendations is complicated by the differentvalence states of chromium compounds, the different methods of measurement(CrO<T2>3</T2> or Cr(VI)), and differences in defining those substances thatpresent a cancer hazard (soluble vs. insoluble or valence state). The 0.05ppm TWA-TLV is less restrictive than the current 0.05 ppm ceiling limit(as Cr(VI)), and would not be considered a revised PEL. OSHA thereforetentatively proposes that the existing PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ (measured asCrO<T2>3</T2>) be maintained. Because of the problems noted above, OSHA willconsider whether the NIOSH REL should be adopted in place of the 0.1 mg/m\3\limit (measured as CrO<T2>3</T2>) during the public hearing phase of this rulemaking. OSHA willalso consider whether to place these substances on its regulatory agendafor future consideration for section 6(b) rulemaking, rather than makingany changes as part of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="26">CHROMYL CHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14977-61-8: Chemical Formula: CrO<T2>2</T2>Cl<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH's TLV-TWA for this substance is 0.1ppm. Dimethyl sulfate is commonly used in the manufacture of many organic chemicals.It has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats by inhalation exposure, subcutaneousinjection, and prenatal exposure. The rat is the only animal species inwhich the carcinogenesis of dimethyl sulfate has been tested (IARC 1974).The carcinogenic activity of dimethyl sulfate was investigated in malerats chronically exposed to subcutaneous injections of 8 or 16 mg/kg bodyweight per week (Druckrey et al. 1966). Local sarcomas with metastasesto the lung and regional lymph nodes were observed at both dose levels.A single subcutaneous injection of dimethyl sulfate (50 mg/kg) also producedlocal sarcomas with metastases to the lung (Druckrey et al. 1970). However,tumors did not develop following chronic weekly intravenous injectionsof dimethyl sulfate (2 or 4 mg/kg) (Druckrey et al. 1970). Control datawere not reported for either of these studies. The carcinogenic potential of dimethyl sulfate exposure by inhalation wasalso evaluated in male rats (Druckrey et al. 1970). Animals were exposedto approximately 3 or 10 ppm dimethyl sulfate for 1 hour per day five timesweekly for 130 days. Malignant tumors developed in 15 percent (3/20) ofthe rats exposed at 3 ppm and in 18 percent (5/27) of the rats exposedat 10 ppm. Pregnant rats were exposed to a single intravenous injection of dimethylsulfate (20 mg/kg body weight) on day 15 of gestation and the incidenceof malignant tumors in the offspring was investigated for 1 year. Tumorswere reported in 7/59 of the offspring. However, the incidence of tumorsin the control group was not indicated. The results of this study are complicatedbecause several rats died (number of deaths not specified) from the acutetoxic effects of dimethyl sulfate, and the incidence of tumors in the controlgroup was not reported. There is little information available regarding the carcinogenicity ofdimethyl sulfate in humans. A case study of workers exposed to dimethylsulfate reported that three workers developed bronchial cancer (Druckreyet al. 1966). However, an epidemiological study by the E.I. du Pont deNemours Company (cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 213) demonstrated no increasein the incidence of respiratory cancer among workers exposed to dimethylsulfate. OSHA considered the possibility of performing a quantitative risk assessmentfor dimethyl sulfate and concluded that the studies described above didnot have sufficient dose-response data to provide an adequate basis forsuch a risk assessent. Dimethyl sulfate induces malignant tumors in animalsboth by inhalation and ingestion, and there is thus sufficient evidencein animals to predict that workers exposed to dimethyl sulfate are at significantrisk of developing cancer; exposures at levels only three times the existingPEL resulted in a significant number of tumors. OSHA preliminarily concludesthat reducing the current limit to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA will reducethis risk and will substantially reduce this significant risk of cancermortality.<ITAG tagnum="26">NICKEL (SOLUBLE COMPOUNDS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-02-0; Chemical Formula: Varies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1283</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for all forms of inorganic nickel (as Ni) is 1 mg/m\3\TWA. The ACGIH has recommended that the TLV-TWA for soluble forms of nickelbe reduced to 0.1 mg/m\3\. NIOSH recommends that exposure to any form ofinorganic nickel be maintained at or below 0.015 mg/m\3\. A variety of toxic effects results from exposure to nickel compounds. Solublenickel salts cause contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals and eyeirritation (ACGIH 1986, p. 422). High rates of asthmatic lung disease havebeen reported among nickel-plating workers (EPA 1986). Three soluble nickel compounds have been tested for their carcinogenicpotential: Nickel chloride, nickel sulfate, and nickel acetate. In addition,the sparingly soluble compounds, nickel carbonate and nickel hydroxide,have been studied. As a whole, the results of animal studies suggest thatsome soluble nickel compounds are potentially carcinogenic. Results fromoccupational studies are inconclusive for soluble nickel compounds becauseof the presence of several types of nickel compounds in the facilitiesstudied. One cohort of nickel refinery electrolysis workers exposed tonickel sulfate experienced an increased risk of lung cancer compared withthe facility's roasting and smelting workers (Doll 1958). OSHA proposesto lower the PEL for soluble nickel compounds to 0.1 mg/m\3\, due to recentevidence that, in animals, exposure to low levels causes lung damage thatis indicative of pre-neoplastic changes. Nickel chloride has been reported to be mutagenic in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3><T3>and Cornebacterium, </T3>but negative in <T3>E. coli </T3>(EPA 1986). The positive studies are not considered conclusive,however, because the <T3>S. typhimurium </T3>report is an abstract lacking detailed data and<T3>Cornebacterium </T3>is not the usual species used in these tests. Amacherand Paillet (1980) reported that nickel chloride was mutagenic in mouselymphoma cells and demonstrated a dose-response relationship. Some <T3>in-vitro </T3>studies using soluble nickel compounds report findingchromosomal aberrations (EPA 1986). These studies do not demonstrate adose-response relationship or statistical significance, which weakens theirfindings. Several <T3>in-vivo </T3>studies have failed to detect chromosomal aberrations(EPA 1986). However, several <T3>in-vitro </T3>studies on nickel sulfate and nickel chloride have reportedfindings of sister chromatid exchanges (EPA 1986). Some animal studies on soluble nickel compounds suggest that these compoundsare carcinogenic in animals. Strain A mice receiving intraperitoneal injectionsof nickel acetate had an increased rate of lung adenomas and adenocarcinomasthat was statistically significant in the high dose group (Stoner et al.1976). The animals were injected 3 times per week for 8 weeks at 72, 180,or 360 mg/kg.EPA (1986) reported a study in which rats were given monthly intramuscularinjections of 35 mg/kg nickel acetate for 4 to 6 months (Haro et al. 1968,as reviewed by Rigaut 1983). Twenty-two percent of the treated rats developedsarcomas. Payne (1964) observed tumor responses in rats after intramuscularimplantation of 7 mg nickel acetate, nickel sulfate, nickel chloride, ornickel carbonate. Implant site sarcomas developed in 1 of 35 rats exposedto nickel acetate, 1 of 35 rats exposed to nickel sulfate, none of 35 ratsexposed to nickel chloride, and 4 of 35 rats exposed to nickel carbonate.Results of other studies on nickel sulfate have been negative. Three studiesused intramuscular injection in rats and reported that no tumors developedin the treated group (Gilman 1962; Gilman 1966; and Kasprazak et al. 1983).An ingestion study also reported no tumors among treated rats or dogs (Ambroseet al. 1976). Gilman (1966) administered 5 mg nickel hydroxide to rats by intramuscularinjection in each thigh. Nineteen out of 40 injection sites developed sarcomas.Kasprazak et al. (1983) gave rats intramuscular injections of nickel hydroxidein gel, crystalline, or colloidal form. Five out of 19 animals receivingthe gel developed sarcomas (2 with metastasis to the lung), 3 out of 20receiving the crystalline form developed sarcomas (1 with metastasis tothe lung), and none of 13 rats receiving the colloid developed tumors.Bingham et al. (1972) exposed rats by inhalation to 0.1 mg/m\3\ nickelchloride for 12 hours a day for 2 weeks. Animals showed evidence of pulmonarydamage and hyperplasia. Rats and guinea pigs exposed daily to 1.0 mg/m\3\(as Ni) nickel chloride for 6 months showed increased lung weight, whichis an indication of pulmonary damage and hyperplasia (Clary 1977). Rabbitsinhaling 0.3 mg/m\3\ (as Ni) nickel chloride aerosol for 30 days showeda doubling in alveolar cell number and volume of alveolar epithelial cells,as well as nodular accumulation of macrophages and laminated structures(Johansson et al. 1983). These studies indicate that exposure above thecurrent OSHA PEL of 1.0 mg/m\3\ for soluble nickel is associated with increasedcell turnover in the lung; the hyperplasia observed in the lungs of treatedanimals is indicative of pre-neoplastic change. Electrolysis workers at a refinery in Kristiansand, Norway experiencedthe highest lung cancer risk in the plant (Mangus et al. 1982). Electrolysisworkers were exposed to an aerosol composed predominantly of nickel sulfate,which was estimated (to contain nickel) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/m\3\(EPA 1986). However, exposure to nickel subsulfide and oxides may haveoccurred in the electrolysis building, and the electrolysis workers mayhave worked in other process departments (Grandjean et al. 1988). Roastingand smelting workers were exposed to an estimated average of 0.5 mg/m\3\(as Ni) of roasting dust. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer were 550 for electrolysisworkers, 390 for other process workers, and 360 for roasting and smeltingworkers. The pattern of SMRs for nasal cancer was different: 2600 for electrolysisworkers, 2000 for other process workers, and 4000 for roasting and smeltingworkers. The results seem consistent with studies showing that roastingand smelting workers have the highest concentrations of nickel in the nasalmucosa, presumably because of the relatively larger particles resultingfrom roasting. Electrolysis workers have higher plasma and urine levelsof nickel, suggesting that nickel aerosolized by this process penetratesto the deep lung (EPA 1986). In contrast to the study of Norwegian nickel refinery workers, an increasedrisk of lung cancer was not found among electrolysis workers at Port Colborne,Ontario (EPA 1986). The characteristics of exposure, however, may not havebeen similar to those experienced by the workers in Norway. <T3>Risk estimate for soluble nickel compounds. </T3>OSHA considered thepossibility of performing a quantitative risk assessment for the nickelcompounds. However, the animal studies on the effects of exposure to thesoluble compounds of nickel do not contain sufficient dose-response datafor such an assessment. Risk estimates can be derived from the study byMangus et al. (1982), which reported excesses in lung cancer and nasaltumors among electrolysis workers exposed predominantly to soluble nickelaerosols. To perform the risk assessment, OSHA used the multiplicativeand average relative risk models (EPA 1986) applied to the excess lungcancer response reported by Mangus et al. (1982). The results of the riskassessment are reported in Table C15-5. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> insert illus. Table 798 </ITAG>Animal studies have clearly demonstrated that lung changes indicative ofpre-neoplastic responses occur as a result of exposure to soluble nickelat levels ranging from 0.1 mg/m\3\ to 1.0 mg/m\3\ for periods of time thatwere far less than the lifetime of the animals. From these studies, itis clear that the current OSHA PEL of 1.0 mg/m\3\ for soluble nickel isinadequate to offer protection against these pathological changes. For example, using the midpoint of the range of excess deaths predictedby the two models (Table C15-5), 14 excess deaths would be predicted tooccur among 1,000 workers exposed over their working lifetimes at the currentlimit. This risk is reduced by 90 percent at the proposed level, i.e.,is reduced to 1.4 excess deaths per 1,000 exposed workers. The residualrisk at 0.1 mg/m\3\ is still significant, if the guidelines provided bythe Supreme Court in the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision are used. Soluble nickel has exhibited carcinogenicactivity in animals treated by injection. The finding by Mangus et al.(1982) of excess lung and nasal tumor cancer among workers exposed to solublenickel, although complicated because of concurrent exposure to insolublenickel, is consistent with these animal findings. A quantitative assessmentof cancer risk based on the Mangus et al. (1982) study shows that the potentialcancer risk at the current PEL represents a significant cancer risk, andthat reducing the exposure limit for soluble nickel to 0.1 mg/m\3\ resultsin a substantial reduction of that risk. Because the 0.015 mg/m\3\ NIOSHlimit is based on analytical and sampling limits of detection, the significantrisk and feasibility requirements to which the Agency may not be satisfied.OSHA preliminarily concludes that reducing the current PEL for solublenickel is necessary and proposes to reduce its limit to a 0.1-mg/m\3\ 8-hourTWA, measured as elemental nickel, as an interim PEL. As future prioritiespermit. OSHA may consider the need for a more restrictive standard forthese compounds.<ITAG tagnum="26">2-NITROPROPANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-46-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH(NO<T2>2</T2>)CH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1291</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for 2-nitropropane (2-NP) is 25 ppm; the ACGIH hasan established limit for this substance of 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA andclassifies 2-nitropropane as a suspected human carcinogen (A2). 2-Nitropropaneis used as a chemical intermediate, solvent, and a component in paint,ink, and varnishes (Fiala et al. 1987). Approximately 185,000 workers areexposed to 2-NP during its production and use in printing, highway maintenance(traffic markings), shipbuilding and maintenance (marine coatings), furnitureand plastic product finishes, and food packaging (NIOSH 1980). In rats and chimpanzees, 2-NP is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in theliver to acetone, low levels of isopropanol, and nitrite (Mueller et al.1983). Methemoglobin formation is associated with the metabolism of nitropropaneand has been reported in cats exposed to 280 ppm of 2-NP for 7 hours. Sensitivityto the toxic effects of 2-NP in animals varies by species (Dequidt et al.1972; ACGIH 1986, p. 441). The mechanisms of carcinogenicity of 2-NP are thought to involve the releaseof nitrite and the formation of a reactive azoxy intermediate that canreact with cellular macromolecules (Williams and Weisburger 1986). In mutagenicity tests, 2-NP increased the frequency of mutations in allstrains of <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>with and without metabolic activation.Positive mutagenicity results were reported in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>strains TA100, TA1535, and TA98 by Lofrothet al. (198l) and Speck et al. (1982). 2-NP was not shown to be mutagenicin the mouse micronucleus test (Hite and Skeggs 1979). Acute exposures to 2-NP from occupational accidents have been reportedto cause severe liver toxicity and subsequent death in humans (ACGIH 1986,p. 441). However, the available epidemiology data on the chronic healtheffects of occupational exposure to 2-NP do not contain sufficient dose-responsedata to use as a basis for quantitative risk estimation. An unpublishedretrospective mortality study of 1,481 potentially exposed workers froma nitropropane production plant found no increase in liver cancer or liverdisease mortality. However, lack of exposure data, the small number ofworkers with long exposures (greater than 15 years), and a short latencyperiod make interpretation of the results of this study difficult (Millerand Temple 1979; Bolender 1983). There are two studies that report high incidences of liver tumors in malerats exposed to 2-NP by gavage and inhalation. Fiala et al. (1987) administered,by gavage, 1 mmol/kg body weight (approximately 27 mg/treatment per 300-gramrat) of 2-NP in a 10 percent aqueous Emulphor EL-620 vehicle to male Sprague-Dawleyrats three times weekly for 16 weeks. Dosing was discontinued after 16weeks because of excessive mortality in the treated rats. Seventy-sevenweeks from the first treatment, the surviving rats were sacrificed andsubjected to necropsy. All (100 percent) of the treated rats examined haddeveloped hepatocarcinomas. The results of the Fiala et al. study (1987) support the earlier positiveresults reported by Lewis et al. (1979). In the Lewis et al. study (1979),male Sprague-Dawley rats and male New Zealand White rabbits were exposedvia inhalation to 27 ppm or 207 ppm of 2-NP for 7 hours/day, 5 days/weekfor 6 months. At the end of 6 months, all 10 rats in the high-dose groupexhibited hepatocellular carcinomas and neoplastic nodules. No exposurerelated lesions were seen in the rats exposed to 27 ppm, and no exposurerelated lesions were observed in any of the rabbits. One high-dose and two low-dose studies reported negative results for ratsexposed to 2-NP vapors. Griffin et al. (1978) reported no hepatic carcinomason exposing male and female rats to 200 ppm of 2-NP by inhalation usinga protocol similar to that described by Lewis et al. (1979). Although nohepatic carcinomas were observed, the following effects (generally occurringmore extensively in males) were seen: Increased liver weights (both sexes);hepatic nodules; hepatocellular necrosis; and peripheral compression. Two low-dose studies by Griffin et al. (1980, 1981) also produced negativeresults. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by inhalationto 25 ppm of 2-NP for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week for 22 months. No pathologicalchanges associated with exposure to 2-NP were seen. Although the results of both the Lewis et al. (1979) and the Fiala et al.(1987) studies show statistically significant increases in liver carcinomas,neither study provides sufficient dose-response information to use as abasis to quantify the excess cancer risk to humans exposed to 2-NP. Bothstudies were terminated before the natural lifetime expectancy of the controls,so it is not possible to determine a background incidence of cancer risk.No historical information is provided on tumor incidence for these animals.2-Nitropropane produced a high incidence of liver tumors in male rats bytwo routes of administration: Inhalation and ingestion. Its ability tocause mutations in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>further supports the premise that 2-NPis a potential human carcinogen. OSHA considered whether to perform a quantitativerisk assessment on 2-NP. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the studiesdescribed above do not contain sufficient dose-response data to use asthe basis for quantitative risk estimation using standardized risk assessmentmodels. However, two studies (Fiala et al. 1987, Lewis et al. 1979) demonstratethat exposure to 2-NP, either by gavage or inhalation, produced hepatocarcinomasin rats. In addition, this substance produced positive results in two mutagenicassays (Lofroth et al. 1981, Speck et al. 1982). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour PEL for 2-NP of 10 ppm. The Agency preliminarilyconcludes that a reduction in the PEL is necessary to protect exposed workersfrom the significant risk of cancer potentially associated with exposureto 2-NP at the current PEL. The proposed limit will substantially reducethis significant occupational risk.<ITAG tagnum="26">STYRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-42-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>CH=CH<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1372</ITAG>OSHA's current occupational limits for styrene are 100 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, 200 ppm as a ceiling limit not to be exceeded for more than 5 minutesin any 3-hour period, and 600 ppm as a peak limit. The ACGIH has recommendedlimits of 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 100 ppm as a 15-minute STEL for styrene.NIOSH has a recommended standard for styrene of 50 ppm as a 10-hour TWA,with a 15-minute ceiling of 100 ppm.An increased incidence of cancer has been reported among workers exposedto styrene. In addition, styrene has been demonstrated to be carcinogenicin animals. The discussion below summarizes the human and animal data andpresents OSHA's quantitative assessment of the cancer risk potentiallyassociated with occupational exposure to styrene. McMichael et al. (1976), in a nested case-control study, identified a sampleof male workers who had worked for 5 or more years at a tire manufacturingplant where exposure to styrene (and butadiene) occurred. The authors foundthe age-standardized relative risk for this cohort (128 workers), comparedwith that of the total plant population (6,678 workers), to be 6.2 forlymphatic and hematopoietic cancer, 3.9 for lymphatic leukemia, and 2.2for stomach cancer. In a follow-up unpublished analysis (discussed in EPA1987), the relative risk for lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer was revisedto 2.4. In a retrospective cohort mortality study, Meinhardt et al. (1982) identifiedfive deaths from leukemia and aleukemia (1.8 expected, SMR = 278) among600 workers in a synthetic rubber manufacturing facility. Workers at thisplant had been exposed to styrene (and butadiene) for at least 6 months;the mean concentration of styrene at the plant was 0.94 ppm. Because ofthe concurrent exposure to butadiene reported among the study cohort, thesestudies can be said to support but not conclusively to prove that exposureto styrene is associated with an elevated risk in workers of hematopoieticcancer and leukemia. In a study sponsored by the Chemical Manufacturers Association (Dow 1978,as cited in EPA 1987), male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposedto styrene vapor at concentrations of 600 to 1200 ppm, 6 hours per day,5 days per week, for 18 or 20 months. The higher exposure level was reducedto 1000 ppm after the first 2 months of exposure because of excessivelyreduced weight in the male rats. A statistically significant increasedincidence of mammary tumors was reported in low-dose female rats (7 of87) compared with controls (1 of 85); no increase in mammary tumors wasreported among high-dose female rats. The authors questioned the significanceof this response, since historical control animals from the same laboratoryshowed a higher background incidence of mammary tumors than the controlsused in this study. An increased incidence of leukemia and lymphosarcoma was also observedin both low-dose and high-dose females; both experimental groups exhibitedthe same incidence (6 of 85), compared with 1 of 85 in the controls. Althoughthe increased incidence was not statistically significant compared withthe incidence in concurrent controls, the increase was highly significantcompared with historical control rates. The tumor response in male ratswas confounded by excessive non-treatment-related mortality. In a 1979 NCI study, male and female B6C3Fl mice and Fischer 344 rats weretreated by gavage 5 days per week for 78 weeks (low-dose rat groups weretreated for 103 weeks). The study was terminated at 91 weeks for mice and104 to 105 weeks for rats. Dose-related increases in alveolar/bronchiolaradenomas and carcinomas were observed only in the low-dose (150 mg/kg)and high-dose (300 mg/kg) male mice; the incidence of tumors for vehiclecontrols, low dose, and high-dose male mice was 0/20, 6/44, and 9/43, respectively.Although the historical incidence of tumors among untreated controls was12 percent (32/271), the historical incidence of vehicle controls was 0/40.<T3>Quantitative Risk Assessment for Styrene. </T3>OSHA assessed the excesscancer risk associated with 45 years of occupational exposure to styreneusing both the NCI (1979) male mouse lung tumor response and the Dow (1978)female rat leukemia/lymphosarcoma response. Risk estimates derived usingthe multistage model and the NCI data set yielded estimated excess cancerdeaths of 280 or 150 per 1,000 employees exposed to 100 ppm or 50 ppm overtheir working lifetimes, respectively (95 percent upper-bound estimateswere 460 or 220 per 1,000, respectively). However, the daily doses associatedwith 45 years of occupational exposure to 100 ppm or 50 ppm styrene arewell above the daily dose administered to the high-dose group of mice inthe NCI gavage study, which places the estimated human doses outside thelinear range of the model. As a consequence, the NCI gavage study is notsuited to estimating risk in the range of exposure represented by the currentand proposed limits for this substance. Because the daily human doses corresponding to 45 years of exposure to100 ppm or 50 ppm styrene in the Dow (1978) study are well below the dailydoses administered to the female rats, these data can be used as the basisfor a quantitative risk assessment. The risk estimates based on this studyare presented in Table C15-6. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> insert illus. Table 806 </ITAG>Styrene has been shown to be carcinogenic in two species of animals andby two routes of administration. Human studies also implicate styrene asa potential human carcinogen, but these studies are confounded by concurrentexposure to butadiene in the cohorts studied. However, it is noteworthythat the excess cancers that have been found in workers exposed to styrenebutadiene(hematopietic cancer and leukemia) involve the same tumor site affectedin rats exposed to styrene by inhalation. OSHA's quantitative risk assessment based on the rat inhalation study indicatesthat an excess of 19 cancer deaths will occur among 1,000 employees exposedto the current PEL of 100 ppm styrene for 45 years; clearly, this representsa significant risk. Reduction of the PEL to 50 ppm will reduce this significantrisk substantially; the reduction from 100 to 50 ppm reduces the risk existingat the current PEL by 50 percent. Therefore, OSHA proposes to revise itsexisting PEL for styrene to 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; OSHA also proposesto supplement the TWA-PEL with a 100-ppm 15-minute STEL to ensure thatworkplace exposures are maintained under good industrial hygiene control.OSHA is proposing the 50-ppm limit as an interim measure. As future prioritiespermit, the Agency will consider additional rulemaking for this potentoccupational carcinogen, at which time OSHA will investigate whether itis feasible to reduce exposures further.<ITAG tagnum="26">o-TOLUIDINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">CAS: 95-53-4; Chemical Formula:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">CH</ITAG><T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>NH<T2>2</T2><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1399</ITAG>OSHA's current 8-hour TWA for o-toluidine is 5 ppm. The ACGIH identifieso-toluidine as a suspected human carcinogen and has accordingly placedit in the A2 category (ACGIH 1986, p. 586). The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of2 ppm, with a skin notation, for this substance. The International Agencyfor Research on Cancer (IARC 1982) classifies o-toluidine as a probablecarcinogen (category 2A) based on sufficient evidence of its carcinogenicityin rats and mice following oral administration (IARC 1982). IARC judgedthe human evidence inadequate to establish o-toluidine's carcinogenicityin human tests. o-Toluidine is mutagenic in short-term tests, inducing sister chromatidexchanges and unscheduled DNA synthesis in mammalian cells in vitro andchromosomal anomalies in yeast. o-Toluidine was negative in the micronucleustest in mice in vivo, but induced cell transformations in the BHK (babyhamster kidney) assay. IARC considers these data to be sufficient evidenceof o-toluidine's activity in short-term tests (IARC 1982). There are a number of studies that report an excess of bladder tumors indyestuff workers exposed to o-toluidine and other chemicals; however, thereare no studies that examine a population of workers exposed to o-toluidinealone. Workers exposed to toluene, o-nitrotoluene, o-toluidine, and 4,4methylene bis (2-methylaniline) in manufacturing were observed to havean excess of bladder tumors. However, the concurrent exposures of theseworkers to these other potential carcinogens make these data inappropriatefor use in the quantitative assessment of o-toluidine's carcinogenic riskin human populations. A few reports of bladder tumors in persons exposedprimarily to o-toluidine have been reported, but insufficient follow-uptime and incomplete data have prevented the establishment of a clear quantitativeassociation between o-toluidine exposure and cancer in humans. For thisreason, IARC considers the data from human studies inadequate to establishan association between exposure to o-toluidine and cancer (IARC 1982).o-Toluidine has been determined to be carcinogenic in rats and mice followingoral administration. In rats, statistically significant increases in subcutaneousfibromas, fibrosarcomas, and cancers of the urinary bladder have been reported.Studies in mice have resulted in statistically significant increases inhemangiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. The National Cancer Institute (NCI 1979) conducted long-term carcinogenicitystudies with o-toluidine in rats and mice. Both of these studies were positivefor carcinogenicity. The mouse study used groups of 50 female and 50 maleB6C3F1 mice fed o-toluidine hydrochloride in the diet at levels of 1000ppm or 3000 ppm for 102 to 103 weeks. There was no excess mortality inthe tested animals. At the 3000-ppm dose level, there was a statisticallysignificant increase in hemangiosarcomas at all sites in males and a statisticallysignificant increase in hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in females.The National Cancer Institute also conducted a 2-year feeding study with50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats. There was a dose-related trendin mortality (which was not caused by cancer); all the males in the high-dosegroup died by 100 weeks. However, the females at both dose levels wereobserved to have significant increases in transitional-cell carcinomasor papillomas of the urinary bladder, and the high-dose females developedfibroadenomas of the mammary gland. The males at both dose levels showedsignificant increases in fibromas of the subcutaneous tissue and mesotheliomasin multiple organs (NCI 1979). The high mortality in the males complicatesthe interpretation of these latter findings. Weisburger et al. (1978) reported positive findings for o-toluidine inlong-term feeding studies in rats and mice. The study in rats was conductedwith two groups of 25 male CD rats fed o-toluidine in the diet via oneof two regimens: 8000 ppm for 3 months and then 4000 ppm for an additional15 months; or 16,000 ppm for 3 months and then 8000 ppm for an additional15 months. Statistically significant increases in the incidence of subcutaneousfibromas and fibrosarcomas were observed in both dose groups. In addition,there was a non-statistically significant increase in the incidence oftransitional-cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder in these animals. Weisburger et al. (1978) also reported the results of a long-term studyin mice. Groups of 25 male and 25 female CD-1 mice were fed diets containingo-toluidine at two dose levels: 16,000 ppm for 3 months and then 8000 ppmfor an additional 15 months; or 32,000 ppm for 3 months and then 8000 ppmfor an additional 15 months. There was a statistically significant, dose-relatedincrease in the incidences of vascular tumors (hemangiosarcomas and hemangiomasof the abdominal viscera) in both sexes of treated mice, compared withresults in control mice. <T3>Risk estimate for o-toluidine. </T3>Four of these carcinogenicity studiesof o-toluidine have yielded sufficient and adequate data for quantitativerisk estimation: The two NCI studies (NCI 1978) and the two Weisburgeret al. (1978) studies. OSHA has used the NCI study in rats as the basisfor its quantitative risk assessment because it provides the most appropriatedata. Table C15-7 presents the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of excessdeaths per 1,000 employees predicted to result from exposure to o-toluidineat the current OSHA PEL of 5 ppm and at the proposed PEL of 2 ppm. Thesedata were calculated using a multistage model, GLOBAL83. Table C15-7 shows an excess MLE estimate of risk of 1.4 per 10,000 workersexposed over their working lifetimes at the current PEL. This risk wouldbe reduced to 0.5 per 10,000 exposed workers after promulgation of theproposed limit of 2 ppm. This level of risk is lower than the levels OSHAhas regulated for some carcinogens, such as ethylene oxide, arsenic, andbenzene. However, this risk is approximately the same as that associatedwith exposure to formaldehyde; in the case of formaldehyde, OSHA considereda reduction in exposure of approximately this amount to be appropriate(see the discussion at 52 FR 46211-37, December 4, 1987). Based on thatanalysis, OSHA preliminarily concludes that the significant risk of carcinogenicityto which workers are currently exposed at the existing PEL would be substantiallyreduced by promulgation of the proposed PEL.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. table 811</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p-TOLUIDINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-49-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>NH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Male andfemale mice were exposed to p-toluidine in the diet for a total of 18 months.During the first 6 months of the experiment, mice were exposed to 1000and 2000 mg p-toluidine/kg diet. As a result of the weight loss that occurredin mice exposed to the 2000 mg/kg diet dose, the concentrations of p-toluidinewere reduced to 500 and 1000 mg/kg diet during the last 12 months of exposure.The rate of food consumption by the animals was not reported and was assumedto be 3 g/day. Thus, the average doses of p-toluidine received during the18-month exposure were calculated to be 80 and 160 mg/kg body weight perday (Weisburger et al. 1976). For both the low and high dietary doses of p-toluidine, a significant increasein the incidence of hepatomas was observed. The incidence of tumors inthe control, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day groups were 3/38, 10/38, and 12/35,respectively. The same study (Weisburger et al. 1976) showed negative resultsin male rats exposed to two doses of p-toluidine in the diet for 18 months(1000 and 2000 mg/kg diet).<T3>Risk estimate for p-toluidine. </T3>To assess the quantitative riskof p-toluidine's carcinogenicity, OSHA used the Weisburger et al. (1976)data which, despite some limitations, e.g., changes in dose levels duringthe experiment and the absence of data concerning the amount of food animalsconsumed during the exposure period, were considered adequate for riskassessment purposes. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of excess cancers per 1,000 workersover an occupational lifetime and the 95 percent upper-bound estimateswere obtained by using a linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83). Thesevalues are summarized in Table C15-8. This table shows the number of cancerdeaths potentially associated with working lifetime exposure to 20, 5,or 2 ppm p-toluidine. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> insert illus. Table 813 </ITAG>OSHA preliminarily concludes, as Table C15-8 shows, that workers exposedto p-toluidine, which is currently not regulated by OSHA, are at significantrisk of developing hepatomas. For example, the MLE at 20 ppm is 112 excesscancer deaths per 1,000 workers exposed over a working lifetime. Promulgatingthe proposed PEL of 2 ppm will substantially reduce this significant risk.According to this scenario, a 90-percent reduction in excess cancer deathswould be achieved by establishing the 2-ppm limit. The risks existing atthe present uncontrolled level are clearly significant and have been determinedto be so in several previous OSHA rulemakings. OSHA is proposing a 2-ppmlimit as an interim measure. As future priorities permit, the Agency willconsider additional rulemaking to investigate whether it is feasible andappropriate to reduce exposures further.<ITAG tagnum="26">VINYL BROMIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 593-60-2: Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>3</T2>Br </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. 1425</ITAG>OSHA has no current PEL for vinyl bromide. The ACGIH has established an8-hour TWA of 5 ppm for this substance; NIOSH has no REL for vinyl bromide.The ACGIH places vinyl bromide on its A2 list of industrial substancessuspected of having carcinogenic potential in humans. Vinyl bromide isused as an intermediate in organic synthesis and in the manufacture ofpolymers, copolymers, and flame retardants. Its principal use is as a flameretardant. Henschler and Hoos (1982) believe that vinyl bromide undergoes the samemechanism of biotransformation as its structural analog, vinyl chloride,a recognized human carcinogen that has been regulated by OSHA in a section6(b) rulemaking. The microsomal oxidation of vinyl bromide leads to epoxideformation, which results, in turn, in the formation of a reactive intermediate.This intermediate has the potential to form covalent bonds with DNA toproduce a mutagenic response. Vinyl bromide has been reported to be mutagenicin <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>and <T3>tradescantia </T3>(IARC 1979; NIOSH/OSHA 1978). No epidemiological studies have been conducted on populations exposed tovinyl bromide. Benya et al. (1982) reported a positive carcinogenic responsein an inhalation study of rats exposed to vinyl bromide vapor; this studyis important because inhalation is a major mode of occupational exposure.The results of the Van Duuren (1977) study were equivocal (described below),in that female Swiss albino mice were exposed dermally or by subcutaneousinjection either to vinyl bromide in acetone or to polymerized vinyl bromidein an aqueous latex solution. Benya et al. (1982) exposed male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to 0, 9.7,52, 247, or 1,235 ppm vinyl bromide by inhalation for 6 hours daily, 5days per week, for 2 years. The incidence of angiosarcomas, primarily ofthe liver, was found to be statistically significant in all dose groupstested except controls. The combined incidences of hepatic angiosarcomasin the treated male and female rates were 1/288, 17/240, 86/240, 122/240,and 84/240 for their respective dose levels. One control female rat developedan hepatic angiosarcoma. Table C15-9 summarizes the incidence of angiosarcomain control and treated rats. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> Insert illus. Table 816 </ITAG>Van Duuren injected a group of female ICR/Ha Swiss mice once weekly for48 weeks with 0.05 ml of commercial polymerized vinyl bromide aqueous latexsuspension; the animals were observed for 420 days. Nineteen of the 30mice developed sarcomas at the site of injection. Animals in a positivecontrol group that had been injected with b-propriolactone (0.3 mg/.05ml trioctanoin) developed 18 sarcomas and 3 squamous cell carcinomas (in30 mice). No tumors developed in untreated controls or in controls injectedwith trioctanoin, an organic solvent, alone (Van Duuren 1977). In another injection study by the same author, a group of female IRC/HaSwiss mice were treated with 25 mg vinyl bromide per animal in 0.05 mltrioctanoin once weekly for 48 weeks. The mice were observed for 420 days.One control group was given a weekly injection of trioctanoin alone andthe other control group was untreated. No local tumors were seen in anyof the test groups, although pathological examination of the animals appearsto have been incomplete (Van Duuren 1977). Application of vinyl bromide to the skin of female ICR/Ha Swiss mice ata dose of 15 mg per animal administered in 0.1 ml of acetone 3 times weeklyfor 420 days resulted in no tumors. When this solution was applied onceand was followed by an application of phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) 3times weekly, 1 of 30 mice developed a skin papilloma at 412 days, onecontrol treated with PMA developed a tumor after 44 days, and no untreatedcontrols developed tumors (Van Duuren 1977). In another dermal study, a dose of 0.1 ml of polymerized vinyl bromidein an aqueous latex suspension was applied 3 times weekly to the skin offemale ICR/Ha Swiss mice for 420 days. No skin tumors developed, when thissolution was applied once, followed by an application of PMA 3 times weekly,1 of 30 mice developed a skin tumor at 175 days. No untreated controlsdeveloped skin tumors (Van Duuren 1977). <T3>Risk estimate for vinyl bromide. </T3>The Benya et al. (1982) studywas a well-designed and conducted study that yielded sufficient informationfor quantitative risk estimation. The route of administration used in thestudy, inhalation, is directly applicable to occupational exposure, andthe incidence of hepatic angiosarcoma was significant. Angiosarcoma isa rare and malignant neoplasm that has a very low background incidencein animals and humans. Therefore, its appearance in the exposed rats supportsthe premise that vinyl bromide is potentially carcinogenic in humans. Also,it is the same tumor that is associated with the exposure of workers andanimals to vinyl chloride, a recognized human carcinogen and a compoundwhose structure is similar to that of vinyl bromide.To estimate excess cancer risk over background incidence for a chemical,experimental data (experimental doses and corresponding responses) areused to define various parameters of an assumed response model. At lowdoses, the slope of this dose-response curve is referred to as q<T2>1</T2>. The 95 percent upper-bound confidence limit for this slopeis referred to as q<T2>1</T2>* or the chemical's potency. q<T2>1</T2> and q<T2>1</T2>* are then used to determine the respective maximum likelihoodestimate (MLE) of risk and the 95 percent upper-bound confidence limit(UCL) on risk associated with a given lifetime occupational exposure. Anon-threshold, linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83) was chosen to estimatethe risk potentially associated with exposure to vinyl bromide becausethe scientific rationale for this model is biologically the most plausible.Additionally, the choice of a non-threshold model is consistent with currentmethodologies when positive mutagenicity data are available (EPA 1984).To choose the appropriate data set to use with the model, the most sensitivespecies and sex are chosen. In the case of vinyl bromide, both male andfemale rats responded equally, and data from the two groups were thereforecombined by calculating the geometric means of the risk estimates derivedfrom the male and female response data (Anderson 1983). The high-dose datafor each test group were dropped, since their inclusion makes the dose-responsecurve non-monotonic and precludes proper fitting of the linearized multistagerisk model (EPA 1984). Since cancer risk modeling assumes lifetime exposure, adjustments weremade to fit the animal data to this criterion. The adjustments made forthe data in Benya et al. (1982) were: Multiplying dose by 5/7 to adjustfor days of exposure per week and by 6/24 to adjust for hours of exposureper day. These adjusted doses were then changed to human equivalent doses.Three hypothetical occupational exposure limits, 5 ppm, 20 ppm, and 250ppm, were used to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of risk ofdeveloping angiosarcoma of the liver. Five ppm has been the ACGIH limitsince 1978. Twenty ppm was chosen as an intermediate exposure level, and250 ppm was the exposure level before the ACGIH reduced it in 1978. Theseoccupational dose levels were also adjusted for lifetime exposure. Theadjustments made were: multiplying dose by 5/7 to adjust for days workedper week, by 50/52 to adjust for vacation time, by 8/24 to adjust for hoursof exposure per day, and by 45/70 to adjust for work years per lifetime.Because inhalation is the primary route of exposure to vinyl bromide inoccupational settings, the occupational dose was calculated assuming thatair intake in humans is 20 m\3\ per 24-hour day (Anderson 1983). The fractionof vinyl bromide absorbed was assumed to be 100 percent, because no absorptionrate data were available for vinyl bromide. Because the log p (lipid solubility)value for vinyl bromide (1.52) is similar to that of vinyl chloride (1.38),OSHA assumed that the absorption rates of these two compounds would alsobe similar. The absorption rate for vinyl chloride used in risk estimationsis assumed to be 100 percent (IRIS 1988). The MLE shown in Table C15-10 for an occupational exposure to 250 ppm is0.87. or 87 percent. According to the linearized multistage risk model,870 of 1,000 workers exposed over their working lifetimes to vinyl bromideat 250 ppm are at risk of developing angiosarcoma. The MLE for an occupationalexposure to 5 ppm of vinyl bromide is 0.04; this indicates that, at theproposed PEL, 40 workers per 1,000 exposed to this substance over theiroccupational lifetimes are at risk of developing angiosarcoma.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. table 820 </ITAG>Table C15-10 shows that workers exposed to this substance, which is currentlynot regulated by OSHA, are clearly at significant risk of developing hepaticangiosarcomas, the same rare type of tumor associated with exposure tovinyl chloride, a structurally similar substance. Promulgating the proposedPEL of 5 ppm will not eliminate this significant risk, because, as TableC15-10 shows, the upper-bound estimate of residual risk at 5 ppm is 48excess deaths per 1,000 exposed workers. Thus, residual risk at 5 ppm isclearly significant. OSHA is proposing the 5 ppm limit as an interim measure;as future priorities permit, the Agency will consider additional rulemakingfor this potent occupational carcinogen. At the present time. OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that establishing a PEL of 5 ppm will substantially reduce thesignificant risk potentially associated with exposure at the uncontrolledlevels possible in the absence of an OSHA limit for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="26">VINYL CYCLOHEXENE DIOXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-87-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>12</T2>O<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1426</ITAG>OSHA has no PEL for vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (VCD), and NIOSH has no RELfor this substance. The ACGIH classifies VCD as a suspected human carcinogen(A2) and recommends a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm for it. Vinyl cyclohexene dioxideis a colorless liquid used as a chemical intermediate and as a monomerin the manufacture of polyglycols containing unreacted epoxy groups (Hineet al. 198l). It is also used as a reactive diluent for other diepoxidesand certain epoxy resins (IARC 1976). Turchi et al. (1981) assayed the mutagenicity of VCD and several otherepoxides using the TA100 strain of <T3>S. typhimurium </T3>and V79 Chinese hamster cells; these authors alsoinvestigated the alkylating properties of these chemicals. VCD tested positivelyin the <T3>S. typhimurium </T3>test (point mutation) and in the V79 Chinese hamstercell test (both point mutation and chromosome aberration) and had an intermediatealkylating capacity relative to other epoxide compounds tested. There are no data concerning the adverse health effects of VCD in humans.There are no reports as a result of industrial experience that reveal carcinogeniceffects in workers caused by VCD exposure (ACGIH 1986). Four studies have reported the development of skin tumors in mice exposeddermally to VCD (Hendry et al. 1951; Kotkin and Falk 1963; Weil et al.1963; and Van Duuren et al. 1963). The study of Van Duuren et al. (1963)included controls and is thus particularly well suited for an evaluationof VCD's carcinogenic potential.These authors painted 30 male Swiss ICR/Ha mice with 0.1 ml of a 10-percentsolution of VCD in benzene three times per week (approximately 100 mg ofsolution per application). Two negative controls were used; one set of150 mice was treated with benzene alone and another set of 207 mice wasnot treated with anything. Fourteen of the 30 VCD-treated mice developedskin tumors after an undefined length of time (mean survival time was 326days). The incidences of skin tumors in the controls were 11/150 and 13/207for the benzene-treated and untreated mice, respectively. The incidenceof skin tumors in the VCD-treated mice was significantly greater than theincidence observed in either of the controls (Van Duuren et al. 198l).The study of Van Duuren et al. (1963) demonstrates the carcinogenicityof VCD in experimental animals. OSHA considered the possibility of conductinga quantitative risk assessment VCD, and the Agency preliminarily concludedthat the dose-response data in this study are unsuitable for quantitativerisk assessment purposes because the VCD was administered in a solutionof benzene, which is itself regulated as a carcinogen and classified assuch by several authorities (IARC, NTP, NIOSH, and ACGIH). Even thoughthe Van Duuren et al. study included a control for the independent carcinogeniceffects of benzene, the possibility of a synergistic or additive effectof benzene on VCD cannot be completely ruled out. Vinyl cyclohexene dioxide has been shown to be carcinogenic by dermal applicationin mice, and four studies have confirmed these effects. Based on theseanimal studies showing VCD's carcinogenicity, OSHA preliminarily concludesthat exposed employees are at significant risk of cancer potentially associatedwith exposure to VCD at the uncontrolled levels permitted in the absenceof any OSHA limit. The Agency preliminarily concludes that promulgationof a 10-ppm 8-hour-TWA PEL will substantially reduce this significant risk.Preliminary Conclusions for this Group of Substances The Supreme Court in <T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I. </T3>(supra, the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision) gave OSHA directions as to its decisional process,and of course that case involved a carcinogen. OSHA is following the SupremeCourt's guidance within the context of this present broader rulemaking.In the current rulemaking, OSHA has considered or performed preliminaryperform risk assessments for each of the 17 chemicals discussed in thissection. The risk assessments follow the approach OSHA has used in priorrulemakings for carcinogens, a process that has repeatedly been upheldby the courts. The risk assessment review process has necessarily beenmore limited for the hundreds of substances being regulated today thanis the case for single-substance rulemakings, and OSHA requests commenton the approach it has taken in the present rulemaking. OSHA is conducting its significant risk analyses utilizing the principlessuggested by the Supreme Court and adopted in its carcinogen rulemakingssubsequent to <T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I. </T3>OSHA is proposing to lower its existing exposure limitsbased on these analyses when significant risk is indicated at the existingPEL. OSHA is preliminarily proposing either the ACGIH or NIOSH numericallevel, based on the results of these significant risk analyses. In some cases (all of the risk assessments have not yet been finalized)it is possible for OSHA to conclude that not enough data are availableto quantify risks at the level of detail the Agency has formerly used.In those cases, OSHA will preliminarily decide whether a lower limit isjustified; without this latitude, the Agency would indeed be in the ``mathematicalstraitjacket'' alluded to by the Court in the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision. In other circumstances, OSHA may decide thatnot enough evidence is available to propose a lower limit. OSHA must also demonstrate the feasibility of the level set. In some cases,OSHA believes it has sufficient preliminary data on the feasibility ofthe proposed limits for these substances. (Of course, all data on feasibilityare welcome.) In some cases further analysis might indicate that neitherthe ACGIH nor the NIOSH-recommended level is the lowest feasible leveland that significant risk remains below either level. However, this rulemakingwould be inordinately delayed by the amount of effort necessary to makefeasibility and significant risk determinations for a greater range oflevels than those already established by the ACGIH and NIOSH. In such circumstances,the level proposed here should be considered to be an interim level. Aspriorities and resources become available, a second-stage rulemaking willbe considered to refine these exposure levels, and the interim level shouldthus be considered a ``backstop.'' For some substances in this rulemaking other than the 17 discussed in thissection, there may be evidence in the literature of carcinogenicity, eventhough the ACGIH has established limits for these based on other-than-cancereffects. For these few substances, OSHA has not initiated a risk assessment,because this additional effort would have delayed this rulemaking unreasonably.In sum, where OSHA preliminarily found that there was sufficient evidenceof potential carcinogenicity to meet the Agency's legal requirements, theAgency has proposed a level based on the risk of cancer. Where there wasnot sufficient evidence readily available, OSHA proposed a level basedon these substances' non-carcinogenic effects. At a later stage, dependingon priorities and resources, OSHA will further review the data to determinewhether a second-stage rulemaking based on carcinogenicity is appropriatefor these few chemicals. Overall, OSHA believes its analyses of proposed limits for carcinogenicchemicals meet the Agency's legal requirements. Accordingly, OSHA preliminarilyconcludes that these limits will lead to substantial reductions in thesignificant risk currently confronting workers exposed to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">16. Substances for Which Current ACGIH TLVs Are Less Stringent ThanExisting OSHA PELS </ITAG>Introduction There are 13 substances for which the ACGIH has increased its recommendedTLVs since the time that OSHA adopted the 1968 TLVs under the authorityof section 6(a) of the Act. These substances are listed in Table C16-1,along with their current OSHA PELs, ACGIH TLVs. NIOSH RELs, CAS numbers,and HS numbers. Evaluating the protectiveness and appropriateness of exposurelimits that are less stringent than the corresponding limits on OSHA'sZ tables represents a special case in this rulemaking. OSHA has previouslystated (see 50 FR 51120, December 13, 1985) the principle to be followedbefore the Agency raises an exposure limit. This issue is discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2826-827</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>In 1978, OSHA issued a cotton dust standard; this standard did not go intoeffect in any of the nontextile industries. However, although the new standard'sPEL for cotton dust did not apply in these segments, the Z-1 limit forcotton dust continued to apply to them. In 1983, OSHA determined that itwould better effectuate the purposes of the Act to exclude the knittingand other nontextile industries from coverage by the Z table limit forcotton dust. In revoking the Z table limit, OSHA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">When it [the Agency] proposes to eliminate a class [of operationsor industry sectors] from either a 6(a) or 6(b) standard on health grounds,the evidence must affirmatively indicate that significant risk is unlikelyto exist for that class at exposures likely to exist after the standardhas been eliminated * * *. OSHA must be able to support with substantialevidence any change it is propounding [50 FR 51120 et seq., Dec. 13, 1985].</ITAG>Accordingly, the Agency must be able to show that exposed workers willnot be placed at increased risk for the health effects at issue even afterthe limit in question has been raised or revoked. In conformance with thisinterpretation, OSHA has carefully examined the bases underlying the adoptionof increased exposure limits by the ACGIH. After reviewing the availabledata for these substances, OSHA has made a preliminary determination thatadequate evidence exists to increase the permissible exposure limits foronly one of these substances (fluorine), and the Agency is now proposingto raise the limit for this chemical to 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with aSTEL of 2 ppm to provide additional protection against excessive short-termexposures. For the remaining 11 substances in this group, OSHA believesthat the available toxicological data are insufficient to meet the increasedburden of proof appropriate when the raising of an exposure limit is underconsideration. For these substances, OSHA is not proposing to revise thecurrent PELs at this time, but requests comments and data on the issue.The following discussion summarizes OSHA's preliminary analyses and findingsfor each of the 11 substances in this group.<ITAG tagnum="26">COPPER (FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-50-B; Chemical Formula: Cu </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1101</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for copper fume is 0.1 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA.Since OSHA adopted this limit in 1971, the ACGIH has increased the recommendedTLV to 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIH's previously recommendedTLV of 0.1 mg/m\3\ was based on personal communications (Newton Whitman1957; 1962) that reported that the taste perception of welders was alteredwhen they were exposed to copper fume at levels ranging from 1 to 3 mg/m\3\for short periods but that exposure to 0.02 to 0.4 mg/m\3\ did not causesuch complaints (ACGIH 1966). At the time, the ACGIH judged the 0.1-mg/m\3\TLV to be ``sufficiently low to provide freedom from irritation from thefume by a reasonable margin'' (ACGIH 1966). In 1972, the ACGIH received a personal communication from a member of theU.K. Industrial Hygiene Unit, Her Majesty's Factory Inspectorate (Luxon1972) reporting that employees exposed to copper fume at levels up to 0.4mg/m\3\ during welding and copper metal refining operations experiencedno ill effects from exposure. Based on this additional evidence, the ACGIHincreased its TLV for copper fume to 0.2 mg/m\3\ in 1975. OSHA preliminarily judges that the evidence cited by the ACGIH (1986) insupport of the increase in its TLV for copper fume is not sufficient toprovide a basis for OSHA to propose raising the limit for this substance.The basis for this finding is that the ACGIH's action was based largelyon a personal communication, making it impossible for the Agency to evaluatethe evidence appropriately.<ITAG tagnum="26">1,1-DICHLOROETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-34-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>ClCH<T2>2</T2>Cl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1126</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for 1,1-dichloroethane, which is a hepatotoxin,is 100 ppm TWA. The ACGIH recommended TLV is a 200-ppm TWA with a 250-ppmSTEL; NIOSH has no REL for this substance. The previous ACGIH TLV of 100ppm was based on the observation that 1,1-dichloroethane has an acute toxicityapproximately half that of carbon tetrachloride and a chronic toxicitysomewhat less than that of carbon tetrachloride (for which a TLV of 10ppm had been set). In 1973, the ACGIH adopted the higher 200-ppm TLV basedon unpublished data from the Dow Chemical Company showing that rats, rabbits,guinea pigs, and dogs exhibited no gross or microscopic organ pathologyafter exposure to 500 or 1000 ppm of 1,1-dichloroethane for 6 months. TheACGIH cited no human data in support of raising the TLV. Because no human toxicity data are available for 1,1-dichloroethane andbecause the Dow data are unpublished and thus not available for scrutiny,OSHA preliminarily concludes that the evidence for this substance is insufficientto warrant increasing the PEL at this time.<ITAG tagnum="26">FLUORINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-41-4; Chemical Formula: F </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1179</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for fluorine is 0.1 ppm; NIOSH has no REL for fluorine.In 1973, the ACGIH revised its TLV to 1 ppm and, subsequent to that change,adopted a TLV-STEL of 2 ppm. The ACGIH's previous 0.1-ppm TLV, which wasadopted by OSHA in 1971, was based on a 30-day inhalation study in ratsand dogs (Stokinger 1949) in which no consistent pulmonary, renal, or bloodeffects were observed following exposure to 0.5 ppm. The ACGIH believedthat a TLV of 0.1 ppm would ``provide a working environment of probablesafety from the effects of F<T2>2</T2>'' (ACGIH 1966). Subsequently, the ACGIH reviewed a 7-year study(Lyon et al. 1962) of 61 workers exposed to fluorine concentrations ``farin excess of 0.1 ppm'' (ACGIH 1986), which reported a lack of significantmedical findings. This evidence, along with more recent animal evidence(Keplinger and Suissa 1968) suggesting that animals were not as sensitiveto fluorine as was reported by Stokinger (1949), led the ACGIH to increaseits TLV to 1 ppm. The STEL of 2 ppm was supported by a study (Ricca 1970)in which human volunteers repeatedly exposed to 10 ppm reported only slightirritation. OSHA believes that the human and animal evidence is adequate to supporta proposed increase in the 8-hour TWA for this substance from 0.1 ppm to1 ppm. OSHA is proposing at this time to revise the PEL for fluorine to1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 2 ppm as a 15-minute STEL.<ITAG tagnum="26">HEXACHLOROETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-72-1; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>3</T2>CCl<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1197</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for hexachloroethane is a 1-ppm TWA, with a skin notation,which was adopted from the 1968 ACGIH TLV. The NIOSH REL for this substanceis the lowest feasible level, based on hexachloroethane's potential carcinogenicity.The basis for the 1-ppm TLV was to prevent the ``serious injury potentialto several organ systems'' shown by animal studies (ACGIH 1986). Subsequently,the ACGIH revised its TLV upward to 10 ppm based, in part, on a study byWeeks et al. (1979) that reported no adverse effects among several animalspecies exposed daily to 15- or 48-ppm concentrations of hexachloroethane.The ACGIH also cited an NCI study (NCI 1978b), in which ``extremely heavydosages * * * administered continuously for a long period of time'' resultedin the development of hepatocellular tumors in mice but not in rats. The10-ppm TLV was further supported by a personal communication of a TLV Committeemember who reported that no ill effects occurred among workers ``who handledthe material with few precautions'' during World War II (ACGIH 1986). Noexposure data were supplied to support this personal communication. In 1978, NIOSH reviewed the results of an NCI bioassay in which hexachloroethanewas administered by gavage to mice and rats. Both male and female miceexhibited an excess incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, but rats didnot. NCI concluded that early mortality may have obscured detection ofa carcinogenic effect in rats. Toxic kidney damage was also found in miceand rats treated with hexachloroethane. Based on this evidence, NIOSH (1978n)has recommended that exposure to hexachloroethane be maintained at thelowest detectable level. OSHA does not believe that the evidence relied on by the ACGIH is adequateto support raising the PEL at this time. The human evidence cited by theACGIH is anecdotal and lacks the exposure data necessary to permit OSHAto assess whether significant risk is absent (and likely to remain so)at the 10-ppm exposure level. In addition, OSHA is concerned, as is NIOSH,with the development of tumors in hexachloroethane-exposed mice demonstratedin the NCI study. OSHA therefore retains its PEL of 1 ppm TWA, with a skinnotation, and preliminarily concludes that increasing the PEL for hexachloroethanewould increase the risk of cancer potentially associated with exposureto this substance.<ITAG tagnum="26">NICKEL CARBONYL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13463-39-3; Chemical Formula: Ni(CO)<T2>4</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH's former 0.001-ppm TLV was based primarilyon the reported association of nasal and lung cancer among workers exposedto nickel carbonyl during work in nickel refinery operations. In addition,the ACGIH cited evidence (Sunderman et al. 1959) that rats exposed to nickelcarbonyl developed lung tumors that metastasized to the kidney. At thetime, the ACGIH (1966) noted that these tumors were not of a type generallyassociated with exposure to environmental agents. In its 1976 documentation for the 0.05-ppm TLV for nickel carbonyl, theACGIH cited the work of Doll et al. (1970), who evaluated the exposuresof nickel refinery workers in whom cancers had been found. Doll found thatthere had been no exposures to nickel carbonyl in the facility, and thisfinding led the ACGIH to conclude that nickel carbonyl was not the causativeagent of the cancers reported among the refinery workers in the earlierstudies it had relied on to set the 0.001-ppm TLV. A report that no excessnasal or lung tumors had occurred among workers exposed over a 50-yearperiod in a nickel refinery in Wales (Renzoni, personal communication,1975) appeared to the ACGIH to corroborate Doll's results. The ACGIH concludedthat the TLV for nickel carbonyl should be raised based on the acute, systemiceffects of this substance and that carcinogenicity was not an appropriatebasis for limit-setting (ACGIH 1976). In the 1986 documentation for the0.05-ppm TLV for nickel carbonyl, the ACGIH concluded that ``although theevidence that nickel carbonyl is carcinogenic to humans is inconclusive,this recommended TLV (i.e., one set at 0.05 ppm) is also adequate to minimizeany potential carcinogenic effects'' (ACGIH 1986). OSHA finds the evidence discussed by the ACGIH insufficient to warrantan increase in the limit since some of the evidence is in the form of apersonal communication, particularly since NIOSH has concluded that occupationalexposures should be maintained at the lowest detectable level because ofnickel carbonyl's potential carcinogenicity. OSHA therefore retains itsexisting PEL for nickel carbonyl of 0.001 ppm TWA.<ITAG tagnum="26">RHODIUM COMPOUNDS (METAL FUME: SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE SALTS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-16-6; Chemical Formula: Rh </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1347; 1348</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for rhodium metal fume and insoluble salts is 0.1mg/m\3\; the current PEL for soluble rhodium compounds is 0.001 mg/m\3\.The ACGIH recommends a 1-mg/m\3\ TLV for rhodium metal and insoluble saltsand a 0.01 mg/m\3\ TLV for soluble rhodium salts. The current OSHA PELsfor rhodium compounds (i.e., the 1968 ACGIH TLVs) were based on the then-existingTLVs for platinum because of concern that exposure to rhodium might beassociated with respiratory sensitization effects. This concern was prevalentbecause rhodium belongs to the platinum family of metals and because thetoxicologic data on rhodium that were available were ``meager'' (ACGIH1966). The ACGIH's decision to increase the TLVs for rhodium compounds was basedprimarily on a personal communication to the TLV Committee (Johnson 1981).This communication indicated that, in a major precious metals refinery,``procedures which were abandoned for the refining of platinum becauseof cases of sensitization have been carried out for a year with analogousrhodium compounds without any problems'' (ACGIH 1986). In addition, theACGIH noted that none of the substances in the platinum group was knownto produce respiratory effects similar to those of platinum. The ACGIHreported that rhodium exhibited ``slight'' carcinogenic activity in mice(ACGIH 1986). After considering all of this evidence, the ACGIH judgedthe previous TLVs to be inappropriate and increased them tenfold. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the evidence adduced by the ACGIH isnot sufficient to meet the standard of proof the Agency must achieve beforeit can raise an exposure limit. This conclusion is based on the fact thatthe ACGIH relied heavily on a personal communication when making its decision,and no exposure or other data are available to support the ACGIH's action.Thus OSHA is unable adequately to evaluate the toxicologic evidence pertainingto the rhodium compounds and retains the existing PEL's for rhodium metalfume and insoluble salts (0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA) and rhodium soluble salts (0.001mg/m\3\ TWA).<ITAG tagnum="26">SILICA, AMORPHOUS_DIATOMACEOUS EARTH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 68855-54-9; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1352</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for amorphous silica is 20 mppcf, equivalent to 6mg/m\3\ (ACGIH 1984), as total dust. The ACGIH has established a limitfor this dust, as total dust, of 10 mg/m\2\ 8-hour TLV-TWA). Amorphoussilica (diatomaceous earth) is composed of the skeletons of prehistoricplants known as diatoms. These skeletons are largely non-crystalline, althoughdiatomaceous earth can contain varying amounts of crystalline quartz, whichhas led, in the opinion of the ACGIH (1986, p. 520) to conflicting resultsin studies of the pulmonary effects of exposure to this colorless to gray,odorless powder. Cooper and Cralley (1958) reported ``doubtful'' linear-nodular changesin the lungs of workers exposed only to amorphous (noncrystalline) silicafor 5 years or more. Other studies (Vigliani and Mottura 1948; 1948; Gardner1942) also found mild silicosis only or no evidence of serious lung pathologyin diatomite workers. Kovalevich (1959) reported silicosis in diatomiteworkers. However, intratracheal instillation of diatomaceous earth dustin animals showed evidence of fibrosis (Gardner 1942) and silicosis (Kovalevich1959), although another study (Tebbens and Beard 1957) exposed guinea pigsto this substance at an average concentration of 60 mg/m\3\ for 37-50 weeksand found both gross and microscopic changes in the lungs but no fibrosis.In setting its limit for diatomaceous earth, the ACGIH (1986, p. 520) assumedthat this substance itself is either ``weakly fibrogenic or nonfibrogenic,''and thus that those studies discussed above that report adverse pulmonaryeffects actually involved exposure to diatomaceous earth having an unmeasuredbut significant crystalline quartz content. Based on this reasoning, theACGIH considers amorphous silica-diatomaceous earth to be a nuisance dust.However, OSHA does not consider the evidence for diatomaceous earth's lackof fibrogenicity sufficent to demonstrate the absence of significant riskat the ACGIH's revised TLV. OSHA is proposing to retain an 8-hour TWA of 6 mg/m\3\ (equivalent to 20mppcf) for this form of silica. OSHA believes that the health evidencefor this substance is not sufficiently persuasive permit an increase inthe limit at the present time. The Agency is proposing to change the unitsin which its permissible exposure limit is expressed; this change is beingmade to facilitate the accurate monitoring of employee exposures.<ITAG tagnum="26">SILICA, AMORPHOUS, PRECIPITATED AND GEL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1353</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 20 mppcf (equivalent to a limit of 6 mg/m\3\if expressed in mg/m\3\ for amorphous silica. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 10 mg/m\3\ measured as total dust containing less than 1 percent quartz.There are numerous methods of producing precipitated silica; those thatapply heat to siliceous products produce airborne dusts; these are lesstoxic than quartz dust, because the particles are generally sheathed ina molecular layer of amorphous silica (ACGIH 1986, p. 521). Studies of laboratory animals have shown no fibrosis after intratrachealand intraperitoneal injection of precipitated silica or silica gel (Klosterkotter1954; Klosterkotter 1958). Schepers reported in 1957 that rats exposedfor 1 year and guinea pigs and rabbits exposed for 2 years to a concentrationof 126 mg/m\3\ of precipitated amorphous silica displayed no pulmonaryfibrosis; the effects of exposure were limited to macrophage accumulationsand mild proliferation of reticulin fibers (Schepers 1957). In a study of human exposures to precipitated amorphous silica, Wilsonreported no ill effects in 165 workers exposed for an average of 8.6 years(Wilson, Stevens et al. 1981). The ACGIH considers the precipitated and gel form of amorphous silica aninert dust, based on the evidence discussed above. However, OSHA notesthat effects were seen in animals exposed to this substance for 1 to 2years and does not find that this evidence demonstrates the absence ofsignificant risk necessary to support an increase in a PEL. Accordingly,OSHA is retaining its current PEL of 6 mg/m\3\ (equivalent to 20 mppcf)at the present time. The Agency is proposing to change the units in whichits permissible exposure limit is expressed to facilitate the accuratemonitoring of employee exposures.<ITAG tagnum="26">SILVER (METAL DUST AND FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-22-4: Chemical Formula: Ag </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1362</ITAG>The current OSHA standard for silver metal and soluble compounds (includingthe metal dust and fume) is 0.01 mg/m\3\. NIOSH has no REL for this substance,but the ACGIH has established a 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV for silver metal dust andfume. The previous TLV of 0.01 mg/m\3\, which was established for all formsof silver, was designed to protect workers against developing argyria.This condition arises from the accumulation of silver in the body and resultsin an unsightly, widespread blue-grey discoloration of the skin that canpersist for long periods of time. The skin of exposed workers may alsobecome black and have a metallic luster. Argyria may also manifest itselfin the conjunctiva of the eye, which may be affected sufficiently to causelens and visual disturbances. In arriving at the previous TLV of 0.01 mg/m\3\ for silver, the ACGIH reliedon a publication by Pillsbury and Hill (1939), which stated that an accumulatedintake of from 1 to 5 grams of silver would lead to generalized argyria.Assuming a 20-year exposure duration, a 10-m\3\/day respiratory volume,and a 50-percent body retention, the ACGIH estimated that exposure to 0.05mg/m\3\ was sufficient to cause argyria. The former TLV of 0.01 mg/m\3\thus appeared to incorporate a safety factor to account for the uncertaintiesinvolved in using this approach to develop a TLV. The ACGIH's current TLVof 0.1 mg/m\3\ for silver metal dust and fume was determined in a similarfashion, except that the ACGIH assumed a lower percent retention and apparentlydid not incorporate a safety margin (ACGIH 1986). Because the increasein the TLV from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/m\3\ is based on assumptions regarding theextent to which silver metal is systemically absorbed rather than on humandata demonstrating the absence of a significant risk at the revised TLV,OSHA finds the ACGIH's reasoning unpersuasive. Thus DSHA is not at thistime proposing to increase the PEL for silver metal dust and fume.<ITAG tagnum="26">TETRAETHYL LEAD (TEL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-00-2; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>4</T2>Pb </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1386</ITAG>OSHA's current 8-hour limit for tetraethyl lead is 0.075 mg/m\3\ as lead,with a skin notation; NIOSH has no REL for this substance. The ACGIH isnow recommending that worker exposures not exceed 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA; ACGIHalso recommends a skin notation. The previous TLV of 0.075 mg/m\3\ wasbased almost exclusively on a personal communication from the Medical Departmentof the Ethyl Corporation, which stated that a level of 0.075 mg/m\3\ ``isa good guideline for an allowable air concentration of TEL'' (ACGIH 1966).The ACGIH documentation for the 0.075-mg/m\3\ TLV also pointed out thatthe ability of tetraethyl lead to penetrate the skin ``makes reliance onthe airborne concentration impractical in many situations,'' and that urinarylead levels were a more reliable indicator of exposure than blood leadlevels (ACGIH 1966). In its documentation for the 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV, the ACGIH again cited thecommunication from the Ethyl Corporation. In addition, the organizationcited a personal communication from Linch (1968), who reported that animproved analytical procedure for measuring airborne concentrations oftetraethyl lead had been used to determine the relationship between airbornetetraethyl lead levels and urinary lead levels. He reported that urinarylead concentration was not significantly elevated ``above a high normal''value (0.15 mg/L) when the airborne TEL level was 121 ug/m\3\ ACGIH 1986).As a result of this communication, the ACGIH adopted a revised TLV of 0.1mg/m\3\ in 1970. OSHA does not find the evidence presented by the ACGIH to be sufficientlycomprehensive or detailed to permit significant risk to be ruled out atthe 0.1-ppm level. The Agency is particularly reluctant to increase thePEL for TEL in light of this substance's ability to be absorbed percutaneously.OSHA is therefore not proposing to raise its PEL for tetraethyl lead.<ITAG tagnum="26">TETRAMETHYL LEAD (TML) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-74-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>4</T2>Pb </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

There is no NIOSH REL for TML. In establishingthe previous TLV of 0.15 mg/m\3\, the ACGIH cited the work of DeTreville(1962), who reported that tetramethyl lead is about three times more volatilethan tetraethyl lead and thus resulted in employee exposures to airborneTML about three times higher than those for TEL. Despite the heavier TMLexposure of employees, urinary lead levels were not significantly differentfrom the urinary lead levels of employees exposed to TEL. The ACGIH concludedthat a 0.075-mg/m\3\ TLV for TML, identical to the TLV recommended at thetime for TEL, should furnish an adequate margin of safety. The revisedTLV of 0.15 mg/m\3\ was based on a personal communication by Linch (1968),who reported that exposure to 0.179 mg/m\3\ tetramethyl lead was not associatedwith a significant increase in urinary lead levels. Based on the same reasoning as that described above in connection withtetraethyl lead, OSHA is not proposing at this time to increase the existingOSHA limit for TML.<ITAG tagnum="26">URANIUM (SOLUBLE COMPOUNDS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-61-1; Chemical Formula: U </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1419</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for soluble uranium compounds is 0.05 mg/m\3\. NIOSHhas no REL for soluble uranium compounds. Since 1968, the ACGIH has increasedits TLV for soluble uranium from 0.05 mg/m\3\ to 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a 0.6-mg/m\3\STEL. The previous TLV of 0.05 mg/m\3\ was based on animal studies relatingexposure level and duration to the resulting tissue concentration of uraniumand on other chronic animal studies showing the kidney to be the most sensitivetarget organ. In 1968, the ACGIH List of Intended Changes included a TLVof 0.2 mg/m\3\ for all forms of uranium, and this value was adopted bythe ACGIH in 1969. The basis for adopting the 0.2-mg/m\3\ TLV for solubleuranium compounds was a study by Wing et al. (1963), reporting no adverseeffects from radiation exposure over a 25-year period. Although no datawere discussed in the ACGIH (1986) documentation regarding typical exposurelevels at the plants studied, the documentation does mention that sevenaccidental, brief exposures to soluble uranium compounds at levels two-to five-fold the former TLV of 0.05 mg/m\3\ did not result in physiologicchanges or significant body burden. OSHA does not find that the evidence brought forward by the ACGIH is sufficientlydetailed or comprehensive to meet the Agency's increased standard of prooffor relaxing an existing standard. In addition, OSHA notes that the 25-yearperiod of observation in the Wing et al. (1963) study is not long enoughto rule out the occurrence of some forms of radiation-induced cancer and,further, that the power of the study to detect health effects occurringin a small percentage of the population was very limited. OSHA is accordinglynot proposing to raise the current PEL for soluble uranium compounds. <ITAG tagnum="81">17. Substances for Which OSHA is Proposing Short-Term Exposure Limits;Introduction </ITAG>OSHA is proposing to add a short-term exposure limit (STEL) to a totalof 134 substances; 126 of these STELs are values recommended by the ACGIH,while the remaining eight are NIOSH ceiling values for periods of 15 minutesor more. These substances are listed in Table C17-1. When OSHA adopted the ACGIH TLVs via the Walsh-Healey Act and the OSH Act'ssection 6(a) mechanism, the ACGIH had not established the short-term TLVcategory; as a consequence, none of the substances on OSHA's Z-1 tablehave STELs. (Some of the substances on OSHA's current Z-2 tables, whoselimits derive from standards established by the American National StandardsInstitute rather than the ACGIH, have ``acceptable ceiling concentrations''that act in effect as short-term exposure limits.) The ACGIH defines a STEL as<ITAG tagnum="20">a 15-minute time-weighted average exposure which should not be exceededat any time during a work day even if the eight-hour time-weighted averageis within the TLV. Exposures at the STEL should not be longer than 15 minutesand should not be repeated more than four times per day. There should beat least 60 minutes between successive exposures at the STEL. An averagingperiod other than 15 minutes may be recommended when this is warrantedby observed biological effects (ACGIH 1987).</ITAG>Basis Under Which ACGIHEstablished STELs The ACGIH establishes STELs for substances that cause a wide variety ofacute effects; these effects include irritation, narcosis, lung damage,systemic effects, and organic poisoning. The ACGIH first considered addingSTELs to the TLV-TWAs for some substances in 1971 when it appointed a subcommitteeto study the appropriateness of adding such exposure limits to its TLVlist. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 004 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 2 844-847 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>In 1973, this subcommittee recommended that the ACGIH establish STELs asa third category (along with TLV-TWAs and ceilings) of exposure limits.The STEL was defined as the maximum concentration to which workers canbe exposed <T3>for a period up to 15 minutes </T3>continuously without suffering from1. Intolerable irritation, 2. Chronic or irreversible tissue change, or 3. Narcosis of sufficient degree to increase accident proneness, impairself-rescue, or materially reduce work efficiency (ACGIH 1984).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The ACGIH stipulated that no more than four excursions per day werepermissible, with at least 60 minutes between exposure periods, and thatthe daily TLV-TWA could not be exceeded. In 1974, the ACGIH agreed by consensus that 425 of the 520 compounds inits 1973 list should be assigned STELs, but these were not in fact publisheduntil 1976, when ``Tentative Values'' for STELs were listed in the organization'sannual booklet. In 1978, the ACGIH emphasized that, according to its definition,a STEL was not a TWA value but a maximal allowable concentration, or absoluteceiling, not to be exceeded for any time during the 15-minute excursionperiod. The TWA-STEL should not be used as an engineering design criterionor considered as an emergency exposure level (ACGIH 1978). ACGIH redefined the application of STELs in 1979, 1982, and 1984. The 1987-1988ACGIH TLV booklet states that the TLV-STEL is ``the concentration to whichworkers can be exposed continuously for a short period of time withoutsuffering from (1) irritation, (2) chronic or irreversible tissue damage,or (3) narcosis of sufficient degree to increase the likelihood of accidentalinjury, impair self-rescue or materially reduce work efficiency * * * providedthat the daily TLV-TWA is not exceeded.'' In 1982, the ACGIH qualified the conditions under which STELs are recommendedto situations ``only where toxic effects have been reported from high short-termexposures in either humans or animals.'' In 1984, the ACGIH proposed thedeletion of STELs for 142 substances in its Notice of Intended Changes;most of these STELs were deleted in 1986. Another 53 STELs were proposedfor deletion in 1986. These two major revision efforts successfully eliminatedmany STELs for substances with inadequate toxicological support data. Asthe introduction to the most recent edition of the <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices </T3>(1986)indicates:<ITAG tagnum="21">For the vast majority of substances with a TLV-TWA, there is not enoughtoxicological data available to warrant a STEL. Nevertheless, excursionsabove the TLV-TWA should be controlled even where the eight-hour TWA iswithin recommended limits (ACGIH 1987). At present, a total of 122 STELsremain in the ACGIH's most recent TLV list; the organization has removedits recommended STELs for 297 substances on the ground that insufficienttoxicological data existed on which to base a STEL.</ITAG>The ACGIH has stressed that STELs are set on physiological grounds ratherthan in response to sampling and analytical limitations (ACGIH 1984). Separate from the STEL category, the ACGIH in the 1970s established a fourthlimit, a general ``excursion factor'' that should always be observed implicitlybut is not specifically assigned to each chemical. The ``excursion limit''recommended by the ACGIH is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Short-term exposures should exceed three times the TLV-TWA for nomore than a total of 30 minutes during a work day and under no circumstancesshould they exceed five times the TLV-TWA, provided that the TLV-TWA isnot exceeded (ACGIH 1987).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The basis for this excursion recommendation is that any process whoseemissions display a variability greater than would be permitted by thisexcursion factor is not under good industrial hygiene control, and theACGIH believes that in such cases, efforts should be made to restore control(ACGIH 1986). Where specific STELs exist, they take precedence over thegeneral excursion limit (ACGIH 1987). Thus <T3>all </T3>ACGIH TLV-TWAs have implicit excursion limits, but only afew substances (i.e., those for which specific toxicological evidence indicatesthat a STEL is necessary) have explicit STELs. Significance of Risk The STELs being proposed by OSHA in this rulemaking, which parallel thoseSTELs remaining in the ACGIH's most recent list (ACGIH 1987-1988)) arethus limits for substances where there is toxicological evidence of recognizedacute effects resulting from short-term exposure. (STELs also are appropriateto reduce significant risk remaining at the 8-hour TWA limit. See <T3>Public Citizen HRG </T3>v. <T3>Tyson, </T3>796 F.2d 1479, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1986). That issue does notarise for most of the substances covered in this rulemaking. If evidenceis presented or available on this issue, OSHA will consider an appropriateregulatory response.)

its STELs are 15-minutelimits not to be exceeded more than 4 times per day with a minimum of 60minutes between successive STEL exposures; and its ceilings are peaks notto be exceeded for any period of time.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Preliminary Conclusions OSHA is proposing STELs where the Agency believes a short-term limit isneeded to supplement the 8-hour TWA to protect workers from the adversehealth effects associated with exposure to short-term excursions that wouldbe permitted with the 8-hour limit alone. OSHA preliminarily concludesthat, without a STEL, workers remain at risk of experiencing the broadrange of recognized acute effects associated with elevated short-term exposuresto these chemicals. Compliance with a STEL in addition to an 8-hour limitwill substantially reduce the risk of health impairment and functionalincapacity potentially faced by workers exposed to these substances duringexcursions to the levels permitted by the 8-hour limit alone. OSHA believesthat, for this group of substances, the toxicological evidence forms areasonable basis for proposing to supplement the 8-hour permissible exposurelimit with a short-term limit. At the time of the final rule, OSHA will establish short-term exposurelimits for these substances if it determines that STELs will substantiallyreduce significant risk. <ITAG tagnum="81">18. Substances for Which OSHA Is Proposing To Add Skin Notations </ITAG>There are a number of instances in this rulemaking for which OSHA is proposingto add a skin notation to the limit for a substance. In all, a skin notationis being added in 49 cases. Table C18-1 shows all of the substances forwhich the Agency is proposing to add skin notations. The ACGIH began to include skin designations for the chemicals in its listfor the first time in 1961 (Stokinger 1961). At that time, the organizationstated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">This notation is to be interpreted simply as an indicator that skinabsorption may contribute to the overall intake from exposure in additionto that from inhalation. It refers mainly to absorption from liquid contamination(Stokinger 1961).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 857-858 (2 to a page)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>The ACGIH has expanded on its reasoning since the 1960s, and the prefaceto the most recent <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices </T3>(1987-1988)explains that the skin designation is designed to call attention to theneed for ``appropriate measures for the prevention of cutaneous absorptionso that the threshold limit is not invalidated'' (p. 7). Thus a skin notationwarns that exposure via the cutaneous route, including absorption throughthe eyes or mucous membranes, by either inhalation or direct contact, maycontribute substantially to an employee's overall exposure and cause systemictoxicity. In establishing most skin designations, OSHA has relied primarily on animaldata, particularly on dermal LD<T2>50</T2> values in rodents (mice, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs). Thisevidence is occasionally supported by findings in humans, and in a fewcases, human evidence provides the sole basis. The ACGIH has a policy ofusing a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of 2 g/kg as a general cutoff for determining when to classifya substance as sufficiently absorbable to present a hazard via the percutaneousroute; that is, substances having a single-dose dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of less than 2 g/kg receive a skin notation, while those withdermal LD<T2>50</T2>s above this cutoff do not (ACGIH 1986, p. 332). The <T3>Documentation </T3>(ACGIH 1986) contains no cutoff value for chronicdermal exposures, i.e., for toxicity resulting from repeated applicationsof substances to the skin. The following discussions describe OSHA's reasons for adding or deletingskin notations for some OSHA-regulated chemicals or the regulatory candidatesunder consideration. <T3>o-sec-Butylphenol. </T3>In assigning a skin notation to this substance,the ACGIH relied on an unpublished Dow Chemical Company study showing thatthe dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for butylphenol in guinea pigs is between 0.6 and 2.4 g/kg.This range clearly includes the single-dose percutaneous cutoff value of2 g/kg, and skin absorption of butylphenol thus has the potential to contributeto overall exposure and to cause systemic effects in dermally exposed workers.OSHA preliminarily concludes that the addition of a skin notation is warrantedby this avoidance and that the evidence of dermal contact will eliminatethe risk of systemic toxicity posed by this chemical.<T3>Phorate. </T3>Phorate, an organophosphate insecticide, has been proposedfor a skin designation on the basis of its high acute percutaneous toxicity.In male and female rats, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 6.2 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively, values substantially belowthe level used as the criterion for permeability via the percutaneous route(ACGIH 1986, p. 332). OSHA preliminarily concludes that preventing skincontact with this chemical will protect exposed workers from experiencingthe neurologic effects associated with overexposure to this cholinesteraseinhibitor. <T3>Vinyl cyclohexene dioxide. </T3>The skin notation for vinyl cyclohexenedioxide is based on evidence that this substance is highly toxic in ratsgiven a single skin application. The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in this species is 0.62 ml/kg. In addition, this chemical hasbeen shown to cause skin tumors and cancers developing late in life inmice receiving dermal applications of a 30-percent solution of vinyl cyclohexenedioxide in acetone. The ACGIH (1986) reports that ``extreme caution shouldbe exercised in the use of this diepoxide'' because of the ``very limitedtoxicological data and * * * demonstrated carcinogenicity when * * * appliedto the skin of the mouse.'' OSHA preliminarily concludes that the additionof a skin designation to the limit for this chemical is essential to protectworkers both from systemic toxicity via the percutaneous route and fromthe potential risk of developing either systemic or skin cancers. Substances for Which the ACGIH Has Deleted the Skin Notation For four substances, the ACGIH has deleted the skin notations that haveappeared in the 1968 edition of the <T3>Documentation </T3>and which were subsequently adopted by OSHA underthe section 6(a) mechanism in 1971. Table C18-2 shows these chemicals.OSHA is not proposing to delete the skin notations for these four substances.The Agency believes that deletion of these designations would in effectconstitute an increase in the level of exposure permitted and thus a decreasein the extent of worker protection provided by the limits of the currentZ tables. In accordance with principles established by OSHA (see the preamblefor the final revisions to the cotton dust standard, 50 FR 51120 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Agency must demonstrate that deleting these skindesignations, which were established under the section 6(a) mechanism,will not pose a significant risk to exposed workers. The discussion belowdescribes the ACGIH's reasons for recommending deletion of these notations.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 861A </ITAG>The evidence on which the ACGIH based its decision to delete skin notationsfor the four chemicals in question is primarily animal evidence. For DDTand hexachloroethane, the ACGIH deleted the skin designation based on therelatively low dermal toxicity demonstrated by these substances in animalstudies. OSHA preliminarily finds, however, that the absence of significantrisk via dermal absorption has not been sufficiently shown for DDT andhexachloroethane, and thus OSHA is not proposing deletion at this time.For the two remaining substances in this group, paraquat and dipropyleneglycol methyl ether (DPGME), the skin notation was deleted because theACGIH believes that the substance does not, in the case of paraquat, ``penetratethe unbroken or uninjured skin'' or believes, as in the case of DPGME,that the substance is ``practically nontoxic * * * by the dermal routefor rabbits'' (ACGIH 1986). However, OSHA notes that at high doses paraquatdoes ``injure and break down dermal barriers'' and gain entry to the body.The <T3>Documentation </T3>records the case of a 44-year-old man who died ofrespiratory insufficiency after he was poisoned by the percutaneous absorptionof an acutely toxic quantity of undiluted paraquat (ACGIH 1986). The ACGIHalso reports that there is evidence that, despite DPGME's low single-dosedermal toxicity, repeated applications of the chemical to the skin of rabbitscaused death ``in a significant number of the exposed rabbits at levelsof 3 ml/kg and above'' (ACGIH 1986). In accordance with the principles stated in the cotton dust preamble (50FR 51120), OSHA does not find the evidence adduced by the ACGIH sufficientto provide a basis for the deletion of the skin notations for this groupof substances. The Agency preliminarily concludes that deleting the skinnotation from the limits for these four substances will not ensure thatworkers are protected against the risks potentially posed by percutaneousabsorption of these substances.

Summary of Preliminary Feasibility, Regulatory Impact, RegulatoryFlexibility and Environmental Impact Analyses </ITAG>The OSHA Act requires the Agency to consider the feasibility of proposedstandards. Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197) requires that a regulatoryanalysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequences onthe national economy, individual industries, geographical regions, or levelsof government. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) similarly requires OSHA to consider the impact of theproposed regulation on small entities. Consistent with these requirements,OSHA has prepared a Feasibility Analysis, and a Preliminary RegulatoryImpact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for this proposed rule. Detailssupporting this Summary are included in Appendix B of this proposal. Notall of the Supplements to Appendix B are published in this proposal. Theyare, however, available from OSHA. Instructions on how to obtain the Supplementsare given at the end of Appendix B. Approach Because this rulemaking involves about 430 chemicals, OSHA has preparedthe regulatory impact analysis in two phases. Phase I involved the useof a number of secondary data bases to collect information on the chemicalsto be regulated and the industries in which they are used. These data basesprovided information on the toxicity and health effects of exposure tothe chemicals, and current information on engineering controls in use andemergency response procedures. Two data bases provided information on employeeexposures. The 1982 National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) was basedon a sample of about 4,500 businesses. The data base developed from thissurvey contains an estimate of the number of persons occupationally exposedto hazardous substances by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Thesecond data base was OSHA's Integrated Management Information System (IMIS).The IMIS contains the results of air samples taken since 1979 by OSHA industrialhygienists in the course of compliance inspections. Both the NOES and IMISdata bases provided valuable information on the nature and extent of employeeexposures to the substances to be regulated; however, they did not providecomplete information on all substances. Supplementary information was obtainedfrom industrial hygienists and engineers. These experts identified exposurecontrols in use, and the number and size of plants most likely to be affectedby this rulemaking. These sources have provided OSHA with a substantialbody of information on chemical use, exposures and controls. Phase II of the data collection effort involved a sampling survey of over5,300 firms in industries where chemical exposures were believed to posepotential problems. The survey, conducted during the first part of 1988,gathered data on chemicals, processes, exposures and controls currentlyin use. These additional data have permitted OSHA to refine the Phase Ipreliminary estimates of technical and economic feasibility. In addition,site visits to over 100 plants are underway to verify the data collectedto date on chemicals, processes, controls and employee exposures. The reportscovering these site visits will be submitted to the docket prior to thecompletion of the public hearing in this rulemaking. Employee Exposure and Benefits Revising OSHA's Z-Table limits for hazardous substances is expected toresult in reduced risk of chemically related disease among exposed employees.Exposure to substances included in the rulemaking has been associated witha variety of adverse health effects, including impairment of organ systemfunctions, mucous membrane irritation, neuropathy, narcosis, allergic sensitization,respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Using data from OSHA's IMIS system and information collected from the surveyof over 5,300 establishments, OSHA estimates over 17 million employeesare potentially exposed to hazardous substances in the workplace. OSHAalso estimates that over 3.6 million employees are currently exposed abovethe proposed exposure limits for these substances. Table V-1 summarizesOSHA's estimates of the number of workers currently at risk of adversehealth effects. OSHA estimates that promulgation of the proposed exposurelimits will result in a potential reduction of over 55,000 work-relatedillness cases per year, over 23,600 lost-workday illness cases per year,and over 533,000 lost workdays due to illness per year. OSHA's preliminaryestimate is that industry compliance with the proposed exposure limitswill result in a reduction of 519 fatalities caused by exposure to substancesthat cause cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, or liveror kidney disease per year. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 893 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Nonregulatory Alternatives OSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequatelyprotect most workers from the adverse health effects associated with exposureto the chemicals under consideration. OSHA believes that the tort liabilitylaws and Workers' Compensation do not provide adequate worker protectiondue to market imperfections. Some employers have not complied with thestandards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterious healtheffects resulting from continued high levels of exposure to hazardous substancesrequire a regulatory solution. Technological Feasibility Consistent with OSHA regulations and policy, engineering controls and workpractices to control employee exposure are preferred over the use of personalprotective equipment. Engineering controls involve the use of local exhaust ventilation, generalventilation, isolation of the worker and enclosure of the source of emissions,process modifications, equipment modifications, and substitution of non-hazardouschemicals. These methods may be used alone or in combination dependingupon the industrial processes involved. These controls are widely usedand will effectively control exposures either by themselves, or coupledwith changes in work practices.Perhaps the most widely used technique for controlling chemical exposureis the use of ventilation. General ventilation uses the movement of airwithin the general work space to displace or dilute the contaminant withfresh outside air. General ventilation may not be the preferred controlmethod, however, due to the large volumes of air movement required. Localexhaust ventilation uses much smaller volumes of air, exhausted from thepoint or source at which contaminants are generated. Isolation involves placing a physical barrier between the hazardous operationand the worker. Many modern, automated manufacturing processes are nowfully enclosed in ventilated cabinets. The effectiveness of such a controltechnique depends on the frequency with which the workers have to enterthe enclosure during normal operations. In other situations, rather thanplacing the process or machine in an enclosure, the worker is placed inan enclosure. Many processes which involve potential chemical exposuresare operated remotely by operators in air-conditioned booths isolated fromthe hazardous materials. Substitution refers to the replacement of a toxic chemical in a particularprocess or work area with another, less toxic product. Properly applied,substitution can be a very effective control technique. However, care mustbe taken to ensure that the proposed substitute performs in a similar mannerto the product being replaced. In addition, it is essential that the substitutebe carefully evaluated to ensure that in controlling one hazard, anotherdifferent hazard is not inadvertently introduced. The substitute must alsobe compatible with existing manufacturing equipment and processes. The success of these techniques will depend on the physical propertiesof the chemicals and emissions encountered (boiling point, vapor pressure,etc.) and the process operating conditions. In some cases, particularlywith cleaning solvents, substitution may provide the quickest and mosteffective means of reducing exposure. In other situations, a major effortmay be required to alter processes or install or expand local or generaldilution ventilation. OSHA believes that existing engineering controls are available to reduceexposure levels to the new proposed levels. Standard controls have beenadapted in numerous situations to solve situation-specific problems inall of the industry sectors affected. Detailed industry-specific illustrationsof this point are presented in the Technological Feasibility Chapter ofthe Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis. Costs of Compliance Costs of compliance with the proposed rulemaking would result from industryactions to lower workers' chemical exposure to the levels proposed. The1988 sample survey of more than 5,300 firms was drawn from a universe ofover one million firms potentially affected by the rule. Table V-5 at theend of this section presents a list of industries included in the analysis.Survey respondents verified the number of work stations and workers relatedto each process, the process location and configuration, the controls alreadyin place, and potential chemical exposures above new proposed levels. Processcontrols in place were compared to a list of control designs needed tolimit exposures to new lower levels. Where the required controls were notreported to be in place, a compliance cost per work station was assigned.Process control costs were summed per establishment and certain maintenanceworkers were assigned a respirator cost. Costs for the surveyed establishmentswere then weighted (by SIC and size) to represent compliance costs forthe universe of affected plants. The survey found that about 500,000 establishments use the chemicals beingregulated. Of this number, about 101,200 would incur some costs to complywith the proposed rule. The total estimated annualized capital plus annualoperating costs are $927.83 million. Table V-2 presents the annual costby industry sector, for large and small (fewer than 20 employees) plants.Among all industry sectors affected by this proposal, about 101,200 establishmentsare estimated to incur, on average, an annual cost of $9,200.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 898</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Economic Impact OSHA prepared two estimates of the economic effects of the proposal onpotentially affected firms. The two estimates were based upon Zero Cost-Passthrough(``worst case'') and Total Cost-Passthrough (``best case'') scenarios.In the first scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would beabsorbed by firms in the form of reduced profits. Table V-3 contains asummary of this ``worst case'' analysis. Under this scenario, the estimatedaverage percent reduction in profits for all affected firms was less thanone percent. The estimated reduction in profit of 8 percent for SIC 24,Lumber and Wood Products Manufacturers, was the highest among all industries.In the second scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would bepassed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. The potential priceincrease for an industry sector at the two-digit SIC level was estimatedby dividing the sector's compliance cost by its total sales. In this scenario,there would be little impact on market prices; none of the estimated priceincreases exceeded one half of one percent (Table V-4).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 900-901</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Based on this analysis, OSHA concludes that the proposed standard is economicallyfeasible for each sector. The impact on prices is slight and even in theworst cases, the reductions in profitability are small. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1664(5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), OSHA has made a preliminary assessment of how the proposedrulemaking will affect large and small establishments. The results of thispreliminary assessment indicate that some small establishments may experiencesome adverse impact. The smaller profit margins of some small establishmentsmay make it more difficult for them to absorb increases in compliance costs.OSHA requests comments on approaches to reduce the impact on small establishments.An important ameliorating factor for each affected firm will be its abilityto pass through additional costs to the consumer. The ability of individualfirms to do this will be dependent upon product demand elasticities. Itis expected that all impacted firms will be able to pass through some portionof their increased costs. Environmental Impact The proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirementsof the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council onEnvironmental Quality NEPA regulations, and the Department of Labor's NEPAcompliance procedures and is not anticipated to have a significant impacton the external environment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table V-</T4>5._SIC Groups Covered in the OSHA Analysis<H1> </H1>  Division D.

Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Standard. </ITAG>Table Z-4 in the standard includes proposed new exposure limits for 428substances. These include approximately 220 substances for which OSHA hasexposure limits and approximately 205 substances for which OSHA has notspecified exposure limits prior to this proposal. OSHA is republishing Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 which include most existingOSHA exposure limits. Asterisks have been placed next to the substanceswhich OSHA proposes to remove from those tables. All these substances havebeen incorporated in Table Z-4 with new exposure limits. Table Z-4 liststhe proposed permissible exposure limits for 428 substances. This includesthe eleven substances for which increased PELs were considered and twosubstances for which deleting skin notations were considered, but for whichno changes were made. Table VII-C lists 44 substances in which 2 alternatepermissible exposure limits, based on the NIOSH-PELs and ACGIH TLVs, wereevaluated. Part I-D of the preamble explains the basis for the choice ofthese two data bases. The OSHA recommended PEL is underlined in this Table.For most substances noted as changes in Table Z-4 the TWA limit is eitherlower or remains the same but there is a change, or there is an additionor deletion of a STEL or Ceiling limit. For one substance, the TWA hasbeen raised. The policy reasons for this proposal are explained in Part I of the preamble.The health basis of the new exposure limits are explained in Part IV. Thefeasibility analysis for the proposal is summarized in part V. OSHA's preliminary conclusion that the proposed limits noted in Table Z-4substantially reduce significant risk and are feasible, is based on theanalysis in those parts. Initially, OSHA is proposing these new limits for general industry. Additionalconsideration and consultation is needed to determine their applicabilityto other sectors (e.g., construction, maritime, and agriculture). To attemptto consider these sectors in this rulemaking would delay this importantproceeding. OSHA is commencing that consultation for the construction sector.See Part I-H of the preamble for further discussion of this subject. As a matter of form, the final regulation may delete those substances inthe Table Z-4 from Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 rather than republishing themwith asterisks. However, Part 1917, Marine Terminals, references the existingTables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 which OSHA is not proposing to change in this proceeding.Therefore, OSHA may publish the final rule in the same format as the proposa1so that there will be published current CFR exposure limits for MarineTerminals. In that case the asterisk will refer to limits only applicableto marine terminals. Suitable changes will be made in the language of 29CFR 1910.1000 to indicate this. An alternative would be to republish theexisting Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 in Part 1917 until such time as a proceedingto update them is completed. OSHA is adding a new paragraph (d) to andSection; 1910.1000. The old paragraph(d) is redesignated paragraph (f). That paragraph states that employersmust not expose employees over the limits specified in Table Z-4. It definesTWA, STEL and Ceiling limits and indicates skin absorption should be preventedfor substances so identified in Table Z-4. OSHA is not considering any changes to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e)in this rulemaking. Certain format changes have been made to redesignatedparagraph (f) to clarify that the formulas for multiple exposure appliesto substances listed in Table Z-4, substances specified standards listedin Sections 1910.1001-1047 as well as Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3. OSHA interpretsthe existing language as having the same intent. OSHA is not reopeningconsideration of the formulas in redesignating paragraph (f). A slight format change is also made in the introductory text of andSection;1910.1000 to reflect that Table Z-4 has been added. The term ``material'' was used in the standard; it is equivalent to theterm ``substance'' as used in the preamble. The standard provides an explanation of skin notation and definitions ofthe following terms used in Table Z-4: Time Weighted Average (TWA). ShortTerm Exposure Limit (STEL) and Ceiling. The standard states in paragraph 3.(2):<ITAG tagnum="21">(2). An employee's skin exposure to materials listed in table Z-4with an ``S'' Notation shall be 1imited through the use of gloves, coveralls,goggles, or other appropriate personal protection equipment or method necessaryto prevent possible skin absorption.</ITAG>The skin notation is used where the substance may be absorbed through theskin. It also may be used where skin contact could damage or irritate theskin. This sub-paragraph indicates for those substances, methods must beused to limit skin exposure. As the language indicates it may be limitedthrough use of appropriate personal protection equipment. Appropriate engineeringcontrols or work practices may also be used. No specific order of priorityis stated. The standard states in paragraph 3.(3):<ITAG tagnum="21">(3). The following definitions apply to paragraph (d) of this sectionand Table Z-4; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Time weighted average (TWA) is the average airborne exposure ofan employee in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour work week which shallnot be exceeded. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Short term exposure limit (STEL) is the employee's 15-minutetime-weighted average exposure which shall not be exceeded at any timeduring a work day. This applies even if the eight hour time-weighted averageis within the TWA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Ceiling is the employee's exposure which shall not be exceededduring any part of the work day. If instantaneous monitoring is not feasible,then the ceiling shall be assessed by sampling over a 15-minute periodas would be done for a STEL, unless a different time period is specificallyindicated.</ITAG>OSHA intends that the effective date of new exposure limits issued in finalform based on this proposal shall be 90 days after the date of publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This is set forth in section 6(b)(4) of theOSH Act. In addition, OSHA has set forth start-up dates for most of its health standards.It takes time for employers to evaluate exposures and purchase, installand make operable equipment to control such exposures. In the case of this proposed standard, start-up dates need to be sufficientto take into account the fact that many employers will have to evaluateand make operable controls for several different chemicals. This may requiremore time than would be necessary for only one chemical. OSHA believes that 6 months from the date of publication is a reasonabletime to evaluate exposures and come into compliance with any combinationof respirators, work practices and engineering controls. OSHA standardsgenerally have had a period of approximately this length or shorter wherecompliance with an exposure limit was to be achieved with any suitablecombination of controls. See, for example, the benzene standard, 29 CFR1910.1028(m)(2), 52 FR 34460, 345676 (September 11, 1987) and the formaldehydestandard, 29 CFR 1910.1048(p)(2)(iv), 52 FR 46168, 46296 (December 4, 1987).OSHA experience is that the 6 month period is appropriate and sufficientto come into compliance with any combination of controls. Comment is requested.OSHA has also generally provided a more extended period to come into complianceusing the hierarchy of controls contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e), withits preference for engineering and work practice controls. It takes moretime, in general, to plan, purchase equipment, install and make operationalengineering controls than to implement other types of control strategies.Examples of representative phase-in periods include 1 to 10 years (dependingon the sector) for the lead standard, 29 CFR 1910.1025(e), 4 years forthe cotton dust standard, 29 CFR 1910.1043(m), 2 years for the benzenestandard, 29 CFR 1910.1028(m)(2)(ii) and 14 months for the formaldehydestandard, 29 CFR 1910.1048(p)(2)(v). These dates have varied dependingupon OSHA estimates of the difficulties involved. OSHA's experience hasbeen that generally the times proposed here have been sufficient. See thedetailed analysis reported in the cotton dust standard, 50 FR 51164, December13, 1985. In the case of this proposal, OSHA estimates that compliance can be reasonablyachieved by all employers, including those who would have to control exposuresfor several different chemicals, within 4 years, using the present hierarchyof controls. OSHA requests comment on this estimate. OSHA will be shortly publishing a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice requesting public comment on the hierarchyof controls currently contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e). Based on comment,evidence and data received during the course of that rulemaking, it ispossible that changes in the hierarchy may be made. If more flexibilitywere to be permitted in the use of engineering controls, a shorter periodto come into compliance with the new exposure limits might be appropriate.On the other hand, during the period of uncertainty about the outcome ofthe methods of compliance rulemaking, employers seeking to comply withthe new exposure limits may install controls under the existing hierarchythat may turn out later not to be required. Accordingly, it may be appropriateto set a start-up time for installing engineering controls that is contingenton the completion date of the methods of compliance rulemaking. OSHA requests public comment on the approach it should follow and the periodit should set for coming into compliance under the hierarchy of controls.OSHA is not requesting comment in this rulemaking on what the hierarchyof controls should be. For some substances OSHA is tentatively using the 10-hour TWA given inthe NIOSH-RELs as a proposed PEL. It should be noted that NIOSH generallyrefers in its criteria document for airborne concentration of a substanceas a ``time-weighted average (TWA) exposure for up to a 10-hour work shiftin a 40-hour work week.'' OSHA preliminarily concludes that this is equivalentto the OSHA definition of an 8-hour work shift for a 40-hour work week.OSHA requests comments on this approach. NIOSH REL ceiling values are based on time intervals which range from instantaneousto 120 minutes. Most of these REL ceilings have been established for a15-minute period. OSHA proposes that PELs based on REL ceilings of 10,15, and 20 minutes all be considered as 15-minute PELs in order to achievegreater uniformity and simplicity in the standards. OSHA is also consideringtreating the 30-minute, 60-minute and 120-minute ceilings in the same way.OSHA invites comments on these two approaches. OSHA also recognizes that ceiling limits as defined by the ACGIH-TLV committeemay represent a permissible exposure based on instantaneous measurement,or an exposure over a 15-minute period, if instantaneous monitoring isnot feasible. The ACGIH-TLV committee defined a STEL as a 15-minute measurement.Therefore, some of the ceiling limits can be equivalent to STELs. OSHAwill consider adopting the 15-minute period for many of the proposed PELsbased on TLV ceiling values in order to achieve greater uniformity andsimplicity in the standard. OSHA invites comments on this modificationof the definition of a TLV ceiling, and the possible use of two alternatemonitoring procedures (instantaneous and 15-minute) for substances havinga PEL ceiling. It should be noted that OSHA is not proposing to change exposure limitsfor the 24 substances regulated in andSection;andSection; 1910.1000 to 1910.1047.These limits have previously been issued in section 6(b) rulemakings wheretheir health effects and feasibility have been fully considered. TableVII-A lists those substances. Some of those substances remain listed unchangedin Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 as well. Those listings apply in limited particularcircumstances specified by footnotes. OSHA is also not proposing to change exposure limits for 9 other substanceson Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 for which ACGIH or NIOSH have recommended differentexposure limits. OSHA plans to regulate those substances (such as cadmium)in the near future in individual section 6(b) rulemakings because of theimportance of the substance, or the need to fully evaluate the substanceindividually in determining the level to be set. Those substances are listedin Section VII, Table VII-B.OSHA is also <T3>not </T3>proposing to change the limits for 160 substances for whichthe OSHA PEL's and the 1987-88 ACGIH TLV's are identical. Table VII-D liststhese substances. To summarize other sections of the preamble, OSHA reviewed some fourteen(14) data bases in developing an approach to updating the permissible exposurelimits (PELs). These data bases included those developed by professionalorganizations, private-sector corporations, international bodies, governmentsand government agencies. In making a preliminary selection, the sourcesof standards were evaluated for the following criteria: Comprehensiveness,currentness, process setting procedures. feasibility, review process, applicabilityand documentation for each substance. OSHA has preliminarily concluded that ACGIH-TLV is the most extensive sourcewhen compared to a number of other sources, and that it satisfies all theadditional criteria established for this effort. OSHA has also preliminarilyconcluded that NIOSH's recommended exposure limits, while less extensive,should also be considered in the proposal. Thus, the ACGIH-TLVs and NIOSH-RELswill be discussed in order to present the OSHA basis for setting the newproposed PELs. The ACGIH-TLV's are the most comprehensive of all the examined lists. Currently,over 600 substances are covered and TWA's, STELs, ceilings and skin notationsare included where appropriate. The limits developed by the ACGIH TLV committeeare applicable to U.S. industry conditions, and feasibility is generallyconsidered. The ACGIH-TLV process includes multiple professional review, and documentationis included for every recommendation. This documentation includes a discussionof the toxicological data underlying the limit, a description of the exposurelimits set for the chemical by NIOSH and other sources, and a statementof the rationale for selecting a particular limit. In some cases, the ACGIH-TLVdocumentation lacks optimal depth of detail, but in all cases it is possibleto determine what AGCIH judges to be the most directly relevant toxicologicaldata. While some documentation is anecdotal or contained in personal communication,this is generally only one component of the total basis for recommendingthe TLVs. Recently, Castleman and Ziem (1987-1988) and Samuels (1987) havebeen critical of the TLV's committee's procedures and documentation becausea number of references have been based on personal communication and theybelieve industry representatives on the TLV Committee have had too muchinfluence. It should be noted that voting members of ACGIH must be employedby governments or educational institutions. Industry employees do not vote.On the basis of all evidence, OSHA makes a preliminary conclusion thatthe TLVs established by the ACGIH constitute the best available <T3>starting point </T3>for revisions of existing PEL's. This establishesthe<T3> bounds </T3>of the substances to be considered in this proposal asthose substances where the 1987-88 TLVs differ from the existing OSHA PELs.OSHA will also consider the NIOSH-REL's in setting new PEL's in this rulemaking.The NIOSH-RELs are well documented and their RELs are set with U.S. workplacesin mind. NIOSH explains the basis for its limits in criteria documentsor in Current Intgelligence Bulletins. OSHA has considered more than 160 NIOSH-RELs and classified the RELs accordingto the following preliminary assumptions: 1. OSHA has excluded RELs for substances for which the OSHA comprehensivestandards exist. The comprehensive standards had been previously reviewedand analyzed under 6(b) rulemaking process (Tab1e VII-A.). 2. OSHA has excluded RELs for substances which are in various stages ofOSHA rulemaking (Table VII-B). 3. OSHA has identified 9 substances for which the existing OSHA-PELs, NIOSHRELs, and ACGIH TLVs are identical. These substances are exempted fromthe new proposal and are included in Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 without theasterisk. The 9 substances are: Antimony and compounds, benzoyl peroxide,carbaryl, carbon black, diacetone alcohol, dinitrocresol, fluoride, nitriocoxide and sulfuric acid. 4. OSHA has identified 11 substances for which the RELs and the TLVs aredifferent, but the TLV and PEL are the same. OSHA has also identified 19substances which have RELs, but have no corresponding TLVs or PELs. OSHAhas preliminarily decided to exclude these 30 substances from this standard.This is in line with OSHA's discussion in Section I-D which limits thisproposal to those substances where 1987-88 ACGIH TLVs exist and differfrom the existing PEL. 5. OSHA has identified 8 substances for which the RELs equal the TLVs.They are listed in Table Z-4 as proposed PELs and are identified by footnoteC. 6. OSHA has identified 44 substances for which significant differencesbetween the RELs and the TLVs exist. Table VII-C lists 44 substances inwhich two alternate permissible exposure limits are proposed, based onthe NIOSH-RELs and the ACGIH-TLVs. OSHA identified 35 substances for whichthe RELs are lower than the TLVs (Table I-F-A) and 9 substances in whichthe RELs are higher than TLVs (Table I-F-B). These were evaluated on anindividual substance basis and the proposed PEL is listed in Table Z-4.The OSHA proposed PEL is also underlined in Table VII-C. 7. OSHA has identified 15 substances for which the TWA for the RELs andthe TLVs are identical, but differences exist in the STEL or Ceiling limit.OSHA has preliminarily concluded that this is a minor difference and thereforeis using the TLV limits which are included in Table Z-4. This preliminaryapproach is based on the fact that the existing PEL's are based on 1967-68TLV's, and the approach used in this proposal should follow that baselineunless significant differences exist.8. OSHA has identified 16 substances for which the TWA TLV or TWA REL equalsthe STEL/Ceiling; the TWA, TLV or REL equals \1/2\ STEL; or the TWA, TLVor REL are within 10%. OSHA has preliminarily concluded that these areminor differences and has selected the available TWA limit. The 16 substancesin this group are included in Table Z-4. OSHA has also identified a number of substances which require special attentionbecause of differences in the allowable exposure guidelines compared tothe other sets of limits reviewed or other special circumstances. OSHAhas identified several alternatives for dealing with these situations.For its discussion of health effects OSHA has preliminarily grouped eachsubstance on the basis of the TLV documentation. The substances are dividedinto 15 generic groups. These are: Neurophatic effects, narcotic effects,sensory irritants, liver and kidney effects, occular effects, adverse respiratoryeffects, cardiovascular effects, systemic effects, no observed effects,nuisance potential, odor and taste effects, analogy, biochemical and metaboliceffects, sensitizers, and carcinogenic effects. The OSHA analysis alsoconsidered three special categories concerned with: Change only to theSTEL; change regarding skin designation in the TLV; and situations wherethe TLV is greater than the existing PEL. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 018 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 921-938 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.

These methods are indicatedin the Table in this Appendix. The first Table details fully validatedmethods, other methods, substances for which there are no identified methods,and detection limits. The second Table identifies the most recent NIOSHAnalytical methods.A. Fully Validated MethodsFully Validated methods were developed by either NIOSH or OSHA. The criteriaused in validating these procedures were developed independently by eachagency. There are some differences in validation protocol, but in generalsimilar testing procedures were followed. These methods are widely acceptedby the scientific community.B. Other MethodsMethods in this category have not been subjected to all of the testingprocedures required of fully validated methods. Some of these procedureshave been taken directly from the scientific literature and may not havebeen used by OSHA. Some are methods that were validated for a specificanalyte and assumed to be applicable to a similar one.While the precision and accuracy of these methods has not been determinedand may not meet the OSHA accuracy requirement (+25% at the 95% confidencelevel), they are the best procedures currently available at this time.Work at evaluating these procedures is progressing.C. No MethodsThese analytes to not have an adequate sampling method available at OSHA,nor has an appropriate method been found in the available scientific literature.D. Detection LimitsThe values listed under Detection Limits are the lowest air concentrationsthat can be monitored, based on recommended sample air volumes. Detectionlimits for the OSHA validated methods are determined during the evaluation.Detection limits are not routinely determined for OSHA in-house methods,nor were they determined in the validated methods of the NIOSH StandardsCompletion Program. Therefore, the detection limits listed for these methodsare estimated.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Sampling and Analytical Methods</T4><H1>Number analyte</H1><H1>Validated method</H1><H1>Other method</H1><H1>No method</H1><H1>Det limit \1\</H1><H1>Comments</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Introduction and Executive Summary</ITAG>IntroductionThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is proposing toamend its existing air contaminant standards 29 CFR 1910.1000, Tables Z-1,Z-2, and Z-3. The amendments would lower the 8-hour time weighted averagepermissible exposure limits (PELS) for about 100 substances now listedon the ``Z'' tables, raise the limit for one chemical, set exposure limitsfor about 190 substances currently not regulated by OSHA, set short termexposure limits for 70 substances, and, in some cases, set limits for ceilingand skin exposures.BackgroundCongress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act)to achieve several goals, one of which was to protect workers from occupationalhealth hazards. Congress acknowledged the role of occupational exposurein the development of diseases, and addressed in the Act the need to quicklyestablish minimum health standards to control exposure to hazardous substances.To accomplish Congress' intent, OSHA adopted initial exposure limits forapproximately 430 chemicals. Four hundred of these exposure limits werebased on the recommendations of the American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and 21 were from the American National StandardsInstitute. The list of exposure limits was to be updated, improved, andexpanded as new knowledge and techniques were developed. To date OSHA haspromulgated extensive health standards for only 24 individual chemicals.The rulemaking under consideration here would set exposure limits for about430 chemicals based on the 1987-88 Threshold Limit Values of the ACGIH,and recommendations of the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The OSH Act requires the Agency to consider the feasibility of proposedstandards. Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197) requires that a regulatoryanalysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequences onthe national economy, individual industries, geographical regions, or levelsof government. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) similarly requires OSHA to consider the impact of theproposed regulation on small entities. This analysis covers these requirements.ApproachBecause this rulemaking involves about 430 chemicals, OSHA has preparedthe regulatory impact analysis in two phases. Phase I involved the useof a number of secondary data bases to collect information on the chemicalsto be regulated and the industries in which they are used. These data basesprovided information on the toxicity and health effects of exposure tothe chemicals, and current information on engineering controls in use andemergency response procedures. Two data bases provided information on employeeexposures. The 1982 National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) was basedon a sample of about 4,500 businesses. The data base developed from thissurvey contains an estimate of the number of persons occupationally exposedto hazardous substances by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Thesecond data base was OSHA's Integrated Management Information System (IMIS).The IMIS contains the results of air samples taken since 1979 by OSHA industrialhygienists in the course of compliance inspections. Both the NOES an IMISdata bases provided valuable information on the nature and extent of employeeexposures to the substances to be regulated; however, they did not providecomplete information on all substances. Supplementary information was obtainedfrom industrial hygienists and engineers. These experts identified exposurecontrols in use and the number and size of plants most likely to be affectedby this rulemaking. These sources have provided OSHA with a substantialbody of information of chemical use, exposures and controls.Phase II of the data collection effort involved a sampling survey of over5,300 firms in industries where chemical exposures were believed to posepotential problems. The survey, conducted during the first part of 1988,gathered data on chemicals, processes, exposures and controls currentlyin use. These additional data have permitted OSHA to refine the Phase Ipreliminary estimates of technical and economic feasibility. In addition,site visits to over 100 plants are underway to verify the data collectedto date on chemicals, processes, controls, and employee exposures. Thereports covering these site visits will be submitted to the docket by July15, 1988.OSHA has used contractors to assist in these data collection efforts. Threecontractors have supplied expert knowledge on the industries affected andthe engineering controls needed to reach the proposed exposure levels.These contractors and Kearney/Centaur Division of A.T. Kearney, MeridianResearch, and CONSAD. Fu Associates provided datas base management supportduring all phases of this project. Washington Consulting Group designedthe sample for the surveyed firms and KCA Research conducted the telephoneinterviews of these firms.Employee Exposure and BenefitsRevising OSHA's Z-Table limits for hazardous substances is expected toresult in reduced risk of chemically-related disease among exposed employees.Exposure to substances included in the rulemaking has been associated witha variety of adverse health effects, including impairment of organ systemfunctions, mucous membrane irritation, neuropathy, narcosis, allergic sensitization,respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.Using data collected from the survey of over 5,300 establishments, OSHAestimates that between 5.8 million and 6.5 million employees are potentiallyexposed to the 160 hazardous substances identified in the survey. OSHAalso estimates over 1.2 million employees are currently exposed above theproposed exposure limits for these substances. Table I-1 summarizes OSHA'sestimates of the number of workers currently at risk of adverse healtheffects. OSHA estimates that promulgation of the proposed exposure limitswill result in a potential reduction of over 11,000 work-related illnesscases per year, over 8,000 lost-workday illness cases per year, and over147,000 lost workdays due to illness per year. OSHA's preliminary estimateis that industry compliance with the proposed exposure limits will resultin a reduction of 250 fatalities caused by exposure to substances thatcause cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, or liver orkidney disease.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 1030</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Nonregulatory AlternativesOSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequatelyprotect most workers from the adverse health effects associated with exposureto the chemicals under consideration. OSHA believes that the tort liabilitylaws and Workers' Compensation do not provide adequate worker protectiondue to market imperfections. Some employers have not complied with thestandards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterious healtheffects resulting from continued high levels of exposure to hazardous substancesrequire a regulatory solution.Technological FeasibilityConsistent with OSHA regulations and policy, engineering controls and workpractices to control employee exposure are preferred over the use of personalprotective equipment.Engineering controls involve the use of local exhaust ventilation, generalventilation, isolation of the worker and enclosure of the source of emissions,process modifications, equipment modifications, and substitution of non-hazardouschemicals. These methods may be used alone or in combination dependingupon the industrial processes involved.These controls are widely used and will effectively control exposures eitherby themselves, or coupled with changes in work practices.Perhaps the most widely used technique for controlling chemical exposureis the use of ventilation. General ventilation uses the movement of airwithin the general work space to displace or dilute the contaminant withfresh outside air. General ventilation may not be the preferred controlmethod, however, due to the large volumes of air movement required. Localexhaust ventilation uses much smaller volumes of air, exhausted from thepoint or source at which contaminants are generated.Isolation involves placing a physical barrier between the hazardous operationand the worker. Many modern, automated manufacturing processes are nowfully enclosed in ventilated cabinets. The effectiveness of such a controltechnique depends on the frequency with which the workers have to enterthe enclosure during normal operations. In other situations, rather thanplacing the process or machine in an enclosure, the worker is placed inan enclosure. Many processes which involve potential chemical exposuresare operated remotely by operators in air-conditioned booths isolated fromthe hazardous materials.Substitution refers to the replacement of a toxic chemical in a particularprocess or work area with another, less toxic product. Properly applied,substitution can be a very effective control technique. However, care mustbe taken to ensure that the proposed substitute performs in a similar mannerto the product being replaced. In addition, it is essential that the substitutebe carefully evaluated to ensure that in controlling one hazard, anotherdifferent hazard is not inadvertently introduced. The substitute must alsobe compatible with existing manufacturing equipment and processes.The success of these techniques will depend on the physical propertiesof the chemicals and emissions encountered (boiling point, vapor pressure,etc.) and the process operating conditions. In some cases, particularlywith cleaning solvents, substitution may provide the quickest and mosteffective means of reducing exposure. In other situations, a major effortmay be required to alter processes or install or expand local or generaldilution ventilation.OSHA believes that existing engineering controls are available to reduceexposure levels to the new proposed levels. Standard controls have beenadapted in numerous situations to solve situation-specific problems inall of the industry sectors affected. Detailed industry-specific illustrationsof this point are presented in the Technological Feasibility Chapter ofthis Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis.Costs of ComplianceCosts of compliance with the proposed rulemaking would result from industryactions to lower workers' chemical exposures to the levels proposed. The1988 sample survey of more than 5,300 firms was drawn from a universe ofover one million firms potentially affected by the rule. Table I-5 at theend of this section presents a list of industries included in the analysis.Survey respondents verified the number of work stations and workers relatedto each process, the process location and configuration, the controls alreadyin place, and potential chemical exposures above new proposed levels. Processcontrols in place were compared to a list of control designs needed tolimit exposures to new lower levels. Where the required controls were notreported to be in place, a compliance cost per work station was assigned.Process control costs were summed per establishment and certain maintenanceworkers were assigned a respirator cost. Costs for the surveyed establishmentswere then weighted (by SIC and size) to represent compliance costs forthe universe of affected plants.The survey found that about 500,000 establishments reported using the chemicalsbeing regulated. Of this number, about 100,500 would incur some costs tocomply with the proposed rule. The total estimated annualized capital plusannual operating costs are $927.83 million. Table I-2 presents the annualcost by industry sector, for large and small (fewer than 20 employees)plants.Among all industry sectors affected by this proposal, about 101,200 establishmentsare estimated to incur, on average, an annual cost of $9,200.Economic ImpactOSHA prepared two estimates of the economic effects of the proposal onpotentially affected firms. The two estimates were based upon No Cost-Passthrough(``worst case'') and Total Cost-Passthrough (``best case'') scenarios.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 1035</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>In the first scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would beabsorbed by firms in the form of reduced profits. Table I-3 contains asummary of this ``worst case'' analysis. Under this scenario, the estimatedaverage percent reduction in profits for all affected firms was less thanone percent. The estimated reduction in profit of 8 percent for SIC 24,Lumber and Wood Products Manufacturers, was the highest among all industries.In the second scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would bepassed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. The potential priceincrease for an industry sector at the two-digit SIC level was estimatedby dividing the sector's compliance cost by its total sales. In this scenario,there would be little impact on market prices; none of the estimated priceincreases exceeded one-half of one percent (see Table I-4).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 1037</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Based on this analysis, OHSA concludes that the proposed standard is economicallyfeasible for each sector. The impact on prices is slight and even in theworst cases, the reductions in profitability are small.Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisIn accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1664 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), OSHA has made a preliminary assessment of how the proposedrulemaking will affect large and small establishments. The results of thispreliminary assessment indicate that some small establishments may experiencesome adverse impact. The smaller profit margins of some small establishmentsmay make it difficult for them to absorb increases in compliance costs.OSHA requests comments on approaches to reduce the impact on small establishments.An important ameliorating factor for each affected firm will be its abilityto pass through additional costs to the consumer. The ability of individualfirms to do this will be dependent upon product demand elasticities. Itis expected that all impacted firms will be able to pass through some portionof their increased costs.Environmental ImpactThe proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirementsof the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council onEnvironmental Quality NEPA regulations, and the Department of Labor's NEPAcompliance procedures and is not anticipated to have a significant impacton the external environmental.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table I-</T4>4._<T4>Economic Effects: Total-Cost Passthrough</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollars in millions]</ITAG><H1>SIC/industry</H1><H1>Annual costs</H1><H1>Total sales</H1><H1>Costs as a percent of sales</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">20_Food products <D>$33.49 </D><D>$353,780.38 </D><D>.0095</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21_Tobacco <D>0.02 </D><D>74,030.13 </D><D>.0000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22_Text. mill <D>29.48 </D><D>60,735.22 </D><D>.0485</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">23_Apparel products <D>31.74 </D><D>74,474.65 </D><D>.0426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24_Lumber and wood <D>196.09 </D><D>57,994.48 </D><D>.3381</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25_Furniture <D>14.72 </D><D>37,648.28 </D><D>.0391</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26_Paper products <D>31.26 </D><D>103,694.14 </D><D>.0301</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27_Printing and publishing <D>75.69 </D><D>134,830.21 </D><D>.0561</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28_Chemical products <D>40.16 </D><D>272,759.67 </D><D>.0147</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29_Petro. refining <D>7.22 </D><D>196,400.57 </D><D>.0037</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30_Rubber and plastics <D>75.48 </D><D>86,538.58 </D><D>.0872</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31_Leather products <D>2.58 </D><D>15,449.56 </D><D>.0167</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32_Stone and clay <D>22.54 </D><D>46,094.04 </D><D>.0489</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33_Prim. metals <D>40.33 </D><D>112,564.26 </D><D>.0358</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">34_Fab. metals <D>55.94 </D><D>150,146.41 </D><D>.0373</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35_Machinery <D>57.74 </D><D>345,144.89 </D><D>.0167</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">36_Elec. mach <D>31.78 </D><D>245,982.70 </D><D>.0129</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">37_Trans. equip <D>47.10 </D><D>365,427.20 </D><D>.0129</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38_Instruments <D>13.46 </D><D>83,359.57 </D><D>.0162</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">39_Misc. manuf <D>18.20 </D><D>41,870.30 </D><D>.0435</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40_R.R. trans <D>.53 </D><D>43,869.14 </D><D>.0012</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45_Air trans <D>1.83 </D><D>109,538.08 </D><D>.0017</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">47_Trans. services <D>1.85 </D><D>12,254.96 </D><D>.0151</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">49_Elec. gas and san <D>22.69 </D><D>300,254.83 </D><D>.0076</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50_Wholesale trade \1\ <D>4.05 </D><D>13,853.52 </D><D>.0293</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51_Wholesale, non-dur <D>8.86 </D><D>113,848.20 </D><D>.0078</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">55_Auto dealers <D>11.95 </D><D>341,574.50 </D><D>.0035</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">72_Personal services <D>31.29 </D><D>24,270.74 </D><D>.1289</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">73_Business services <D>8.95 </D><D>22,165.94 </D><D>.0404</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75_Auto repairs <D>1.51 </D><D>45,750.92 </D><D>.0033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">76_Misc. repair serv <D>4.85 </D><D>2,665.52 </D><D>.1819</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">80_Health services <D>4.44 </D><D>170,234.25 </D><D>.0026</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F><F>\1\ Consists of SIC 5093 (scrap and waste materials) only.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Table I-5._SIC Groups Covered in the OSHA Analysis<ITAG tagnum="26">Division D.

Survey of Affected Industries </ITAG>Chemicals and other hazardous substances are present to some degree inall industries. However, some industry sectors use chemicals more extensivelythan others and have controls in place which do not always reduce workers'exposures below permissible exposure levels. This chapter presents an overviewof those industries which OSHA believes may experience costs and benefitsas a result of this rulemaking. In order to estimate and quantify the potentialimpact of the rule, a sample survey of over 5,300 establishments was conductedduring the first part of 1988. The results of the survey provided the basisfor the cost and benefit estimates presented in this preliminary RegulatoryImpact Analysis (PRIA). A technical description of the survey is presentedin Supplement 1. In order to determine which industries to include in the sample survey,OSHA relied primarily on two data sources: (1) The NIOSH National OccupationalExposure Survey (NOES) of 1982 and supplementary information from the NIOSH1972 survey; and (2) data in the OSHA Integrated Management InformationSystem (IMIS). The 1982 NOES database contains a sample of the number ofpersons exposed by substance and industry from almost 4500 businesses in98 different geographic areas in the United States. OSHA's IMIS containsthe results of exposure samples taken since 1979 by industrial hygienistsduring the course of compliance inspections. Using these two databases,industries which are likely to use the substances in this rulemaking atlevels which might exceed the proposed exposure limits were identified.As a check on this list of industries, OSHA contracted with about one dozenindustrial hygienists and chemical engineers to review the list. Basedon their professional knowledge, these experts verified the industrieswith potential exposure problems. The final list of industries selectedfor the sample survey included over 30 two-digit and three-digit SICs whereit is believed that chemical exposure potentially exceed the proposed levels.Industry sectors not included in the survey are those where OSHA believesthere is little potential chemical exposure or where existing exposuresare well controlled. Industries which were not surveyed for these reasonsincluded finance, real estate, insurance and most services and retail tradesectors. The construction industry was also excluded and will be the subjectof a separate rulemaking action. Industries such as mining and certaintransportation sectors were not included since other agencies have safetyand health enforcement jurisdiction. Certain industry sectors includingtextile, apparel, food and tobacco products are expected to incur somecosts as a result of this rulemaking, but these were not included in thesample survey. The reasons for not including these sectors were a combinationof the limits imposed by the sample size, relatively low hazardous substanceexposure levels and the availability of adequate information on the engineeringcontrols currently in use in these industries. (Supplement 1 contains alist of the industry sectors included in the sample survey.) Industrial hygienists and engineers under contract to OSHA also identifiedthe processes used in the industries surveyed, and the chemicals used inthose processes. Expected levels of exposure and the number of employeespotentially exposed were estimated. The list of processes and chemicalsdetermined to be in common use in each industry sector was subsequentlyverified in the sample survey. Supplement 2 identifies the processes andchemicals found at the four-digit level for all industries surveyed. Establishments to be surveyed were selected based on a statistical sampleof all establishments in the surveyed industry sectors. For each SIC, establishmentswere selected from four size categories:<ITAG tagnum="15">(a) 0-19 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(b) 20-29 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(c) 100-249 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(d) 250 or more employees</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This permitted analysis of the effects of the rulemaking by establishmentemployment size. About 5,000 completed responses were required to obtain statistically validresults. The field survey was conducted by KCA Research using Computer-AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI). Trained interviewers requested data fromeach establishment regarding production employment, chemical usage, andexposure guidelines in use. Respondents were asked to verify the presenceor absence of chemicals and processes believed to be found in establishmentsin their industry, and were asked to volunteer information on other chemicalsnot included on the interviewers' ``prompt'' list of chemicals in use.For each chemical present, the respondent was asked about amounts used,employee exposure levels, and processes where used. For each process, therespondent was asked questions concerning its configuration, frequencyof use, and the types of controls and personal protective equipment inuse. This information was used to develop the estimates of costs and benefitspresented in this PRIA. The survey results generally corroborated the preliminary assessments ofpotential industry exposure and overexposure to chemicals. In the sampleof over 5,300 firms, about two-thirds reported chemicals being used inthe workplace. Most of the firms which reported no chemical usage weresmall administrative or distribution units of multi-plant companies. Supplement2 contains a list of the chemicals and processes found in the survey. Basedon the survey, OSHA estimates that over 60 percent of production workersin most of the industries surveyed are potentially exposed to chemicalsand about 10-15 percent of these would be overexposed at the levels proposedin this rulemaking. Chapter III presents OSHA's estimates of the benefitsoccuring from a reduction in the number of employees exposed to these chemicals.The industry profiles that follows present economic information on industrysectors expected to be affected by the rulemaking. Most but not all ofthese industries were included in the sample survey. Table II-1 at theend of the chapter, contains employment and establishment data for eachindustry profiled.SIC 20_Food and Kindred Products This major industry group includes establishments that manufacture or processfood and beverages for human consumption as well as certain related productssuch as ice, chewing gum, vegetable and animal fats and oils, and preparedanimal feeds [1, pp. 59 to 69]. Increased disposable income, low commodityprices, changing demographics, and the 1986 tax reforms are expected tobenefit this industry in the next few years. [2, p. 39-1].Employment and establishment data are shown in Table II-1. The total 1985value of SIC 20 shipments ($301.6 billion) was 13 percent of the valueof all manufacturing industry shipments; this represented the largest shareof any two-digit manufacturing industry. The most important industry withinSIC 20 is meat products, accounting for 22 percent of the value of shipments,followed by beverages and dairy products, accounting for 14 percent each[3, Vol 1:8].In 1985, 1.6 million workers in over 29,000 establishments were employedin SIC 20. About 70 percent of these are production workers [Table II-1].Employment has declined since 1979. The largest employer is the meat productsindustry, with 23 percent of the workforce in 1986, followed by preservedfruits and vegetables (15 percent) and beverages (13 percent). Meat andmiscellaneous food products both experienced 1986 employment levels slightlyabove the 1979 peak [4]. The largest number of food products establishmentsare in the manufacturing or processing of miscellaneous foods and meatproducts (17 percent and 16 percent, respectively).Establishments in SIC 20 are similar in size to those in the manufacturingindustry as a whole, although there is a smaller concentration of verylarge establishments. Mean establishment size is 55 workers.Most recent growth by larger food processors has been through businessacquisitions rather than internal expansion. The food and beverage sectoris becoming more concentrated and efficient. In most food industries forwhich data are available, concentration is moderate, with the largest fourfirms having a 30 percent share of sales. Exceptions can be found in cerealbreakfast foods, where the four-firm concentration ratio is just over 75percent, and in soft drinks, where it is 88 percent [2, pp. 39-1 to 39-39].In the next few years, most food and beverage producers will benefit fromincreases in disposable income, favorable trends in consumer purchasingpatterns, and continued low commodity prices. Decreased operating costsand expenses have resulted in a 6 percent increase in income in 1985-86for large food and beverage processors, despite sales gains of only a littlemore than 1 percent [2, p. 39-1].In 1985, the median rate of return on assets in the food and kindred productsindustry was 5.1 percent; this was the third lowest for the 20 two-digitmanufacturing industry group. The highest rates of return were registeredby the cookie and cracker industry and the blended and prepared flour industry(11.8 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively), followed by the flavoringextracts industry (9.2 percent). At the other extreme, the wine and brandyindustry registered a ^0.9 percent rate of return on assets in 1985, withan average rate of under 0.1 percent for the 1984-86 period. The cheeseand rice milling industries also have very low rates of return on assets(2.2 percent) [5].SIC 21_Tobacco ManufacturesEstablishments in the tobacco manufactures industry produce cigarettes(SIC 211), cigars (SIC 212), chewing and smoking tobacco, and snuff (SIC213), or they engage in tobacco stemming and redrying (SIC 214) [1, p.70]. The major worker exposures in these industries are to nuisance dustsgenerated during the initial handling of tobacco and to chemicals thathave been used to treat the tobacco.Data on employment and establishments for SIC 21 are shown in Table II-1.In 1985, the value of tobacco manufacturing shipments was $18.5 billion,slightly more than 6 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturing[3, Vol. 1: 8]. SIC 21 has less than 0.3 percent of the total employmentor establishments in manufacturing [6, pp. 10, 15]. Three-quarters of theemployees in this industry are production workers. The cigarette industryis the most important component of SIC 21, accounting for more than 80percent of the value of shipments [3, Vol, 1: 8] and 70 percent of employmentfor this sector, but only 9 percent of establishments [6, p. 15].Establishments in SIC 21 are large, with a mean size of 296 employees,compared to 55 for all manufacturing. More than half of the establishmentsin this two-digit SIC have fewer than 20 employees [Table II-1]; and morethan 17 percent have 250 or more employees. These large establishmentsaccount for more than 85 percent of all employees. The cigarette industryis especially highly concentrated, with a mean establishment size of 2,430employees. Eleven establishments in the cigarette industry employ 1,000or more workers, and 99.8 percent of all cigarette manufacturing employeeswork in these large establishments. Mean establishment sizes in other tobaccoindustries range from 80 to 135 employees [6, pp. 10, 15]. Employment inthe tobacco products industry has declined every year since 1976 (exceptin 1981), with a total decline in employment of more than 23 percent overthe last decade [4].Most tobacco firms remain profitable because input costs have been relativelystable and prices have increased faster than consumption has declined.The major tobacco companies are continuing to reduce their vulnerabilitythrough mergers and diversification [2, pp. 40-1 to 40-7]. Thus, profitablilityin the tobacco manufactures industry is good. The 1985 median rate of returnon assets (7.7 percent) was the fifth highest median rate of return onassets among firms in the 20 manufacturing industry groups [5].SIC 22_Textile Mill ProductsSIC 22 includes those establishments that perform any of the followingsix operations: (1) Preparation of fiber and subsequent manufacturing ofyarn, thread, braids, twine and cordage; (2) manufacturing broadwoven fabrics,narrow woven fabrics, knit fabrics, and carpets and rugs from yarn; (3)dyeing and finishing fiber, yarn, fabrics, and knit apparel; (4) coating,waterproofing, or otherwise treating fabrics; (5) the integrated manufacturingof knit apparel and other finished articles from yarn; and (6) the manufactureof felt goods, lace goods, nonwoven fabrics, and miscellaneous textiles[1, p. 85].According to the Department of Commerce, in 1986 shipments for the textileindustry increased 4 percent. The value of shipments in 1985 ($53.3 billion)has increased 6 percent since 1981. Employment, however, remained on along-term downward trend, although the 1986 drop was marginal. An upwardtrend in output and relatively high operating rates helped to keep thedrop in employment to a minimum. Also, average hours worked, which increasedin the second half of 1985, continued to rise relatively strongly in 1986[2, p. 41-1].Table II-1 presents data on the number of establishments and employmentin SIC 22. Similar to other manufacturing industries, the mean establishmentsize in SIC 22 was 64 employees. Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 22 experienceda 15 percent decrease in employment. In 1985, almost 86 percent of thenumber of employees were production workers [4]. The median rate of returnon assets in the textile mill products industry was 5.6 percent in 1985[5].SIC 23_Apparel and Other ProductsSIC 23 is referred to as the ``cutting-up and needle trades,'' and includesestablishments producing clothing and fabricating products by cutting andsewing purchased woven or knit textile fabrics and related materials. Thesematerials may include leather, rubberized fabrics, plastics, and furs.In addition, establishments that manufacture clothing by cutting and joiningmaterials are included [1, p. 97].SIC 23 includes three types of apparel establishments: (1) The regularor inside factories, which perform the usual manufacturing functions withintheir own plant; (2) contract factories, which manufacture apparel frommaterials owned by others; and (3) apparel jobbers, which buy raw materials,design and prepare samples, arrange for the manufacture of clothing fromtheir materials, and sell the finished product [1, p. 97]. According toU.S. Department of Commerce estimates, the 1986 value of shipments forSIC 23 experienced a growth rate of almost 2 percent over 1985 values [2,p. 42-2].Between 1980 and 1985, SIC 23 was among the top ten SICs to experiencethe greatest employment decline. Due to large inventories at both retailand wholesale levels and low consumer demand, there were decreases in bothshipments and employment in 1985. In several geographic areas, plants wereforced to close. The drop in employment has been attributed to the recentrise of imports into the U.S. market and to improvements in industry efficiencythrough streamlined operations and increased productivity [2, p. 42-2].The apparel industry is a major employer of women and minorities, employingmore than 6 percent of the manufacturing workforce in plants. Due to intensecompetition in the industry, profits and wages are lower in this industrythan in most other manufacturing industries. The price of labor is thesingle most important cost component in the industry, which accounts forthe sensitivity that employment levels have to industry growth levels.Production workers make up 85 percent of the apparel work force. Typically,as inventory levels grow, production slows down and employment drops [2,p. 42-2].In 1986, current-dollar shipments in the apparel industry expanded in valueby 3 percent. An increase in consumer demand was the major factor contributingto the upturn. Output levels began to regain former levels of output, andthe falling rate of employment of about 1 percent was well below the 3.1percent annual rate of decline during the 1980-1985 period [2, p. 42-2].Table II-1 presents employment and establishment for SIC 23 for 1985. Duringthe period of 1981 through 1985, SIC 23 experienced a 10 percent decreasein employment. Almost 84 percent of the total number of employees wereproduction workers [4]. In 1985, the median rate of return on assets inthis SIC was 6.3 percent [5].SIC 24_Lumber and Wood ProductsThis industry produces logs, pickets and fences, mining timbers, railroadties, poles and pulpwood. SIC 24 includes establishments that cut timberand pulpwood, merchant sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stockmills, planing mills, and plywood mills and veneer mills engaged in producinglumber and wood basic materials; and establishments that manufacture finishedarticles made entirely or mainly of wood or related materials [1, p. 107].According to U.S. Department of Commerce estimates, the logging industry'stimber harvest in 1986 was an estimated $8.5 billion, compared with $8.3billion in 1985 (constant 1982 dollars) [2, p. 4-1].The Department of Commerce reports that a strong expansion of the marketfor wood products took place in 1985 due to gains in housing and nonresidentialconstruction activities. Although domestic demand for softwood lumber wasstrong, Canadian imports displaced American products and contributed toan oversupply, depressing prices. These lower prices lowered U.S. lumberproducer profit margins and induced industrywide efforts to restrict importsof lower priced Canadian softwood lumber. In addition to the oversupplycaused by the competitive prices in Canada, preventive harvesting to avoidpest damage forced inventories to go up and prices to fall further [2,p. 4-1].In 1986, similar trends continued in the domestic market for wood products.This was due to a 6 percent rise in housing starts, continued growth inhome remodeling and renovation, and strong demand from furniture makersand other end users. However, lower-priced softwood lumber imports fromCanada continued to squeeze profits in 1986 [2, p. 4-1].The Canadian softwood lumber prices brought about a trade agreement inMarch 1987 between the United States and Canada, in which Canada agreedto set a 15 percent export tax on its softwood lumber. This action hasproved to be favorable towards the domestic industry for softwood lumberin the United States. Canadian softwood lumber prices in the United Stateshave risen 3 to 4 percent and imports have decreased about 3 to 4 percent.Since the agreement, Canada's market share has dropped from 33 percentto 28 percent. Market earnings in the domestic industry have increaseddespite a drop in housing starts, a strong suggestion that the U.S. isbenefiting from the higher Canadian prices. It is expected that the tradeagreement will keep Canadian softwood prices up and continue to aid thedomestic softwood lumber market [7].Table II-1 presents employment and establishment data form for SIC 24 for1985, as well as for three of the individual three-digit industry groups.In 1985, the mean establishment size in SIC 24 was 19 employees, whichis significantly smaller than the average size in other manufacturing sectors.The median rate of return on assets in this SIC was 7.3 percent [5].SIC 243_Millwork, Veneer and PlywoodThis SIC includes establishments that manufacture fabricated wood millwork,covered with materials such as metal and plastics. According to U.S. Departmentof Commerce, the value of shipments for SIC 243 was $16.7 billion in 1985,which represents 31 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 24. The valueof shipments in SIC 243 increased 21 percent since 1981. In 1985, the numberof employees in SIC 243 was about 37 percent of SIC 24. The number of employeesin SIC 243 increased by 18 percent in 1985, of which about 83 percent ofthis total was production workers. Average hourly earnings dropped about1 percent during that same time period. The number of establishments inSIC 243 in 1985 was about 38 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [4].SIC 245_Wood Buildings and Mobile HomesThis SIC includes manufacturers of wood buildings and mobile homes. The1985 value of shipments for SIC 245 ($6.0 billion) represents 11 percentof the value of shipments for SIC 24 in 1985. The value of shipments inSIC 245 increased 6 percent since 1981. In 1985, the number of employeesin SIC 245 was 10.5 percent of SIC 24. The number of employees in SIC 245increased by 8 percent during this period, of which almost 77 percent ofthese total employees were production workers. The number of establishmentsin SIC 245 in 1985 was 4.4 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [4].SIC 249This SIC covers miscellaneous wood products, and includes four four-digitSICs. SIC 249 represents 12 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 24in 1985. The value of shipments in SIC 249 ($6.6 billion) increased almost19 percent over 1981. In 1985, the number of employees in SIC 249 was about15 percent of SIC 24. From 1981 to 1985, the number of employees in SIC249 decreased by 4 percent, of which almost 84 percent of these employeeswere production workers. The number of establishments in SIC 249 in 1985was about 14 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [4].SIC 2491 includes establishments that treat wood, sawed or planed in otherestablishments, with creosote or other preservatives to prevent decay andto protect against fire and insects. This industry also includes the cutting,treating, and selling of poles, posts, and pilings. The Department of Commercereports that during 1985, there was increased use of treated wood for homeimprovement projects, such as new decks and all-weather wood foundations.Markets for treated lumber and plywood have been expanding, while marketsfor treated telephone poles, marine pilings, and railroad ties tend tobe cyclical and grow more slowly over the long term. The market for railroadties in 1985 was strong, as railroads were able to generate enough cashflow to maintain their track systems by replacing worn out ties. In 1986,however, the market for railroad ties declined. About 30 percent of totaltreated wood shipments are lumber and plywood, of which only about 2 percenthas been used for wood foundations [2, p. 4-14]. The Department of Commerceestimated that in 1986, the value of shipments in this industry increasedby 5 percent [2, p. 4-14]. SIC 2491 represents 23 percent of the valueof shipments for SIC 249 [5]. Employment rose in 1986 by 2.7 percent [2,p. 4-14]. The number of employees in SIC 2491 was almost 16 percent ofSIC 249 and SIC 2491 represents almost 11 percent of all establishmentsin SIC 249 [5].SIC 25_Furniture and FixturesManufacturers of household, office, public building, and restaurant furnitureand office and store fixtures are included in SIC 25 [1, p. 114]. The U.S.Department of Commerce states that producers of furniture and fixturesrecently have been benefiting from lower real interest rates, reductionin the value of the dollar versus other major currencies, and changes inthe tax laws. In addition, the U.S. furniture industry is undergoing consolidation,so that big firms are becoming larger and dominating a greater share ofthe market. The remaining smaller firms are finding it more difficult tocompete, given the rapid increase in low-priced imports. Moreover, newmanufacturing technologies require large capital investments and largevolume, neither of which are readily available to small firms [2, p. 44-2].For the industry, the value of shipments in 1985 increased by 24 percentsince 1981. Although furniture manufacturers anticipate stronger demandin the future, these manufacturers remain uncertain as to the durationand extent of increased demand. Therefore, rather than hiring additionalworkers, producers have increased the average number of hours worked bycurrent employees. This trend was evident in the wood and metal furnitureplants, where average overtime hours increased 16 percent and 24 percent,respectively, in the first half of 1986 [2, p. 44-2].Table II-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 25 for 1985.During this period, SIC 25 experienced a 6 percent growth in employment.Almost 80 percent of the total number of employees working in SIC 25 wereproduction workers. In 1985, the median rate of return on assets in thefurniture industry was 7.3 percent.SIC 26_Paper and Allied ProductsEstablishments in this industry process fiber from trees, wastepaper, andother fibrous materials into end products that are used by both consumersand industry [1, p. 100]. Based on U.S. Department of Commerce estimates,the paper and allied products industry experienced an increase of 14 percentin the value of shipments from 1981 to 1985, and almost 10 percent between1985 and 1986. The 1985 value of shipments was $93.4 billion [2, p. 5-1].Growth patterns in the industry vary, depending on the sector. Some sectorsof the industry are more closely related to changes in industrial activity,while others are more directly affected by changes in real personal incomeor demographic factors. The industry's overall demand patterns are closelylinked to rates of change in GNP. In 1985, for example, real growth forthe industry was judged to be flat, trailing that of GNP. The largest fluctuationsin the industry's shipments have occurred in products geared specificallyfor commercial-industrial use, which are tied to the annual rate of businessactivity [2, p. 5-1].Table II-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 26 for 1985.From 1981 to 1985, employment declined by approximately 2 percent. Almost76 percent of the total number of employees were production workers [4].In 1985, the median rate of return on assets was 7.4 percent [5].Within SIC 26, there are six, three-digit SIC groups, which are describedbelow. SIC 261 includes manufacturers of pulp from wood or other materials.The Department of Commerce reports that U.S. market pulp prices droppednearly 10 percent in the first six months of 1985. The main reasons forthe decline included a leveling of demand, high operating rates at marketpulp mills, large pulp inventories, and new capacity coming into production.By the end of 1985, however, producers' pulp mill inventories had dropped,helping to stabilize pulp prices. About one-fourth of all market pulp companieseither shut down some of their mills in 1985 or curtailed production toreduce the oversupply in the market. In 1986, the industry experiencedincreased productivity, higher prices and improved worldwide demand. ForSIC 261, the value of shipments in 1986 increased by 2.5 percent over 1985.SIC 261 represents 3.4 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 26 [2,p. 5-2].SIC 262 includes manufacturers of paper from wood pulp and other fiberpulp, and manufacturers of converted paper products. SIC 263 includes manufacturersof paperboard. SIC 263 represents 11 percent of the value of shipmentsfor SIC 26. The value of shipments decreased by 3.6 percent. The numberof employees in SIC 263 was less than 1 percent of SIC 26 [4].SIC 264 includes manufacturers of coated or laminated flexible materialsused for packaging purposes. In this sector, the value of shipments, whichrepresents 36 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 26, increased by17 percent during the same period. The number of employees in SIC 264 was34 percent of SIC 26 [4].SIC 265 includes manufacturers of setup paperboard boxes from purchasedpaperboard. Corrugated boxes have taken the place of wooden shipping containers,pallets, and metal drums in the U.S. packaging market in recent years [2,p. 5-6]. Similarly, consumption of folding boxes continued steadily in1985. This pattern continued in 1986 with shipments of corrugated boxesincreasing 5.5 percent and 3 percent for folding boxes. Several importantnondurable end users of folding cartons, such as producers of beverages,dry foods, textiles, sporting goods and toys, hardware, candy, and cosmetics,showed significant declines in real growth in 1985, while the market forboxed paper goods either grew slightly or remained fairly level, [2, p.5-9].Manufacturers of sanitary food containers, such as paperboard milk cartonsand paper serving and eating utensils, are also included in SIC 265. Thisindustry has been strongly influenced by the shift to plastic containers.Having experienced two successive years of decline, in 1986 the industryincreased the value of shipments by 2 percent. Since 1983, the most rapidgrowth area within the sanitary food container industry has been asepticpackaging. This is specially treated paperboard combined with plastic filmand aluminum foil. Sanitary paper products have undergone radical changesin manufacturing in recent years; however, due to the non-discretionarynature of most of this industry's relatively high-priced product line,it has developed a stable base from which to expand.The value of shipments for SIC 265 increased by 16 percent from 1981 to1985. This three-digit SIC represents 24 percent of the value of shipmentsfor all of SIC 26. In 1985, the number of employees in SIC 265 was 29 percentof SIC 26 [3].SIC 266 includes manufacturers of building paper and building board fromwood pulp and other fibrous materials. Trends in employment and value ofshipments have followed overall trends in SIC 26.SIC 27_Printing, Publishing, and Allied IndustriesThis industry is divided into a publishing sector and a printing sector.The publishing sector includes newspaper publishing (SIC 271), periodicalpublishing (SIC 272), book publishing (SIC 2731) and greeting card publishing(SIC 277). The printing sector includes commercial printing (SIC 275),book printing (SIC 2732), and printing trade services (SIC 279) [1, pp.106-110].There were approximately 84,279 establishments in the printing and publishingbusiness in 1985. The majority of these firms (84.1 percent) had fewerthan 20 employees, and the mean establishment size was 17 workers. Thefirms in SIC 27 employed 1.4 million people [Table II-1]. According tothe U.S. Department of Commerce, the value of shipments for all printingand publishing establishments in 1985 was 4.9 percent of the value of shipmentsfor all manufacturing industries. Most of the value of shipments in SIC27 is from the commercial printing sector (32.4 percent). In 1985, themedian rate of return on assets was 8.2 percent for the printing and publishingindustry.Foreign trade has not been a major concern for this industry in the past,but imports are starting to increase at a steady rate. The value of importsand exports was fairly equal in 1986 at $1.3 billion each [2, p. 27-2].The newspaper industry has maintained slow growth in circulation and advertisingover the last several years. Most of the growth in circulation has comefrom the Sunday edition, while daily circulation fell by 0.6 percent. Salesrevenues increased by 8.9 percent, from $14.8 billion in 1986 to $16.2billion in 1987. Advertising revenues rose slightly, but most of this gainwas due to rate increases. Total net worth increased by 17.4 percent from1986 to 1987 [8].The periodical industry has experienced growth in both advertising receiptsand circulation. Advertising revenue increased over 4 percent in 1986,while circulation revenues increased mainly due to the increase in subscriptionsfor consumer magazines. There was a large increase in the number of newpublications entering the market; over 238 new periodicals were publishedin 1986 [1, p. 27-6].Both book publishing and printing showed strong gains over the last severalyears. Sales and employment increased by 3.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.Spurred by the increase in school enrollment, sales of textbooks accountedfor 30 percent of total industry sales. Book printing usually follows thepath of book publishing, increasing substantially when book publishinghas a strong year [1, pp. 27-9 to 27-13].Miscellaneous publishing and printing consists of newsletters, catalogs,directories, greeting cards, and business forms. This industry has seensteady gains due in part to the success of mail-order catalogs, telephonedirectories, and newsletters [1, pp. 27-13 to 27-20].SIC 28_Chemicals and Allied ProductsSIC 28 includes establishments that produce basic chemicals, and establishmentsthat manufacture products using chemical processes. There are three generalclasses of products: (1) Basic chemicals, such as acids, alkalies, salts,and organic chemicals; (2) chemical products to be used in further manufacturing,such as synthetic fibers, plastics materials, dry colors, and pigments;and (3) finished chemical products to be used for consumption, such asdrugs, cosmetics, and soaps; or to be used as materials or supplies inother industries, such as paints, fertilizers, and explosives [1, p. 132].The chemical and allied products industries have experienced small butsteady growth over the recent past. Total shipments by the chemical industryincreased approximately 1.2 percent in 1986, following a 1.2 percent gainin 1985. Chemical prices have been somewhat stable in the industry since1982, due to declining energy costs, which are major factors associatedwith manufacturing costs. Like many other U.S. industries, various sectorswithin the chemical industry are undergoing structural changes, such asmergers, plant closings, sales of plants, and other adjustments. This industryemploys approximately 5 percent of all industrial workers, but more than10 percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers. As seen in Table II-1,SIC 28 experienced a 6 percent decline in employment between 1981 and 1985.In 1985, 55.4 percent of the total number of employees in SIC 28 were productionworkers. The value of shipments increased 8.9 percent during the 1981 to1985 time period. The median rate of return on assets in the chemical industrywas 6.3 percent [5].Within SIC 28, there are eight, three-digit SICs, which are described below.Most known chemicals that are either produced to be used as an end product,by-product, or effluent, or are used as an input in the production of othersubstances, can be found in SIC 28. In the following descriptions of four-digitSIC groups, examples of chemicals produced are listed.SIC 281This SIC includes establishments that manufacture basic industrial inorganicchemicals. SIC 281 represents 10.3 percent of the value of shipments ofSIC 28 in 1985. The value of shipments increased 11.4 percent since 1981,and employment declined by 12 percent. Production workers equaled almost51 percent of all workers. The number of establishments in SIC 281 was14.5 percent of all establishments in SIC 28 [Table II-1].SIC 281 is subdivided into four groups. Examples of the products of eachfour-digit SIC are given below.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2812 Products_</T3>Chlorine, soda ash, caustic potash, causticsoda, washing soda, and sodium bicarbonate.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2813 Products</T3>_Oxygen, acetylene, argon, carbon dioxide, andhydrogen.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2816 Products_</T3>Color pigments, iron colors, iron oxide, leadoxide pigments, mineral colors, titanium pigments, and zinc oxide pigments.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2819 Products</T3>_Sulfuric, hydrochloric, and hydrofluoric acids.SIC282This SIC includes manufacturers of plastics materials and synthetic resins,synthetic rubbers, and cellulosic and other manmade fibers. Plastics makeup a variety of products which are used in diverse markets. Packaging andconstruction account for over 50 percent of consumption, with the remaindergoing into the transportation, electronics, and medical industries. SIC282 represents almost 17 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28. Thevalue of shipments in SIC 282 increased 8.5 percent over the period 1981to 1985. Industry shipments of plastics in 1986 gained 6.3 percent as volumerose in response to slightly increased demand for materials. However, decliningprices of plastic materials held shipments to a 2 percent increase [2,p. 14-1]Table II-1 gives employment and establishment data for this segment. Thenumber of employees in SIC 282 in 1985 was almost 16 percent of SIC 28and the number of establishments was 8 percent of all establishments inthat SIC. In 1985, employment in SIC 282 declined by 12 percent, and productionworkers equaled 66.5 percent of all workers [4].SIC 282 is subdivided into four groups. Examples of the products from eachof these four-digit SICs are given below.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2821 Products</T3>_Cellulose plastics materials, phenolic and othertar acid resins, acrylic resins, polyethylene resins, coumarone-indeneand petroleum polymer resins, and casein plastics.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2822 Products</T3>_Copolymers of butadiene and styrene, or butadieneand acrylonitrile, and polybutadienes. <ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2823 Products</T3>_Cellulose, rayon, and triacetate fibers.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2824 Products</T3>_Fibers of acrylic, acrylonitrile, polyvinylester, and nylon.SIC 283This group includes establishments that manufacture, fabricate, or processmedicinal chemicals and pharmaceutical products. The value of shipmentsin SIC 283 has increased almost 29 percent since 1981. SIC 283 represents16 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28 and almost 20 percent ofthe number of employees. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated thatthe pharmaceutical industry experienced a 6.3 percent increase in the valueof shipments in 1986. However, after adjusting for price changes, thisgrowth rate was closer to 1.8 percent. Productivity also increased in 1986,growing by approximately 2.6 percent [2, p. 17-1].As seen in Table II-1, the number of establishments in SIC 283 was almost12 percent of all establishments in SIC 28. Employment increased by 3 percentsince 1981, and production workers equaled approximately 46 percent ofall workers in SIC 283. Agar, vitamins, antibiotics, vaccines, and virusesare examples of the products of this SIC.SIC 284This SIC includes manufacturers of detergents, emulsifiers, cosmetic, andproducers of glycerin. SIC 284 represents 15 percent of the value of shipmentsof SIC 28. The value of shipments in SIC 284 increased almost 17 percentfrom 1981 to 1985. In 1986 the value was estimated at $31 billion, whichrepresents about a 2 percent increase after adjusting for price changesover 1985 values [2, p. 16-1].The number of employees in this SIC was almost 15 percent of SIC 28 andthe number of establishments was almost 22 percent. In 1985, employmentin SIC 284 had increased by 1 percent since 1981, and production workersequaled approximately 63 percent of all workers in SIC 284 [4].There are four subgroups within SIC 284. Examples of the products producedby each four-digit SIC are given below.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2841 Products</T3>_Soap, synthetic organic detergents, inorganicalkaline detergents, and crude and refined glycerin from vegetable andanimal fats and oils.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2842 Products</T3>_Household, institutional, and industrial plantdisinfectants, non-personal deodorants, dry cleaning preparations, householdbleaches, and other sanitation products.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2843 Products</T3>_Textile and leather finishing agents, solubleoils and greases. <ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2844 Products</T3>_Perfumes, cosmetics, home permanent kits, shampoos,shaving products, and talcum powder.SIC 285This SIC includes manufacturers of paints and allied paint products suchas varnishes, shellacs, and paint removers. The paint industry grew byabout 5.3 percent in 1986, a vast improvement over 1985's decline of 2.9percent. Estimated shipments for 1986 were $11.1 billion, of which architecturalcoatings accounted for about 41 percent, followed by product coatings (35percent) and specialty products (24 percent) [2, p. 15-2].SIC 285 represents about 6 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28.The value of shipments increased almost 21 percent from 1981 to 1985. Thenumber of employees in SIC 285 was 6 percent of SIC 28 and the number ofestablishments was 9 percent.SIC 286This SIC includes manufacturers of a variety of industrial organic chemicals.Industry shipments of organic chemicals increased approximately 3 percentover 1985, which was the same level of growth experienced in the previousyear. In 1985, the value of shipments for SIC 286 was $41.8 billion, representing21 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28. The value of shipmentsin SIC 286 decreased 11.3 percent over the previous year [2, p. 12-6].The number of employees in SIC 286 was almost 11 percent of SIC 28 andthe number of establishments was approximately 7 percent. Employment inSIC 286 increased by 10 percent, and production workers equaled 51 percentof all workers [Table II-1].There are three subgroups in SIC 286. Examples of products for each four-digitSIC are given below.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2861 Products</T3>_Hardwood and softwood distillation products,wood and gum naval stores, charcoal, natural dyestuffs and natural tanningmaterials.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2865 Products</T3>_Toluene, benzene, synthetic organic dyes andpigments.<ITAG tagnum="14"/><T3>SIC 2869 Products</T3>_Alcohols, caprolactum, and ethylene glycol.SIC287This SIC includes establishments that manufacture agricultural chemicalsand pesticides. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the 1985value of shipments of SIC 287 ($14.8 billion) represents 7.5 percent ofthe value of shipments of SIC 28. The value of shipments in SIC 287 decreased9.6 percent from 1981 to 1985. Employment in SIC 287 represented 5 percentof SIC 28, but has declined by 16 percent since 1981. The number of establishmentsin SIC 287 was approximately 9 percent of all establishments in SIC 28and production workers equaled approximately 62 percent [Table II-1].SIC 2873 includes manufacturers of nitrogenous and mixed fertilizers. Thevalue of shipments of nitrogenous fertilizers in 1986 was $3.43 billion,which represents a decrease of approximately 8.2 percent over 1985 shipments[2, p. 13-1].SIC 2874 includes manufacturers of phosphatic fertilizers, such as phosphoricacid, made from phosphate rock. The value of shipments of phosphatic fertilizersin 1986 was $4.67 billion, which represents a decrease of approximately13 percent over 1985 shipments [2, p. 13-3]. Ammonia and phosphoric acidare two substances with potential exposure problems that are produced andor used in SIC 2874.SIC 2875 includes establishments that mix fertilizers from purchased fertilizermaterials. SIC 2879 includes formulators and preparers of ready-to-useagricultural and household pest control chemicals, such as fungicides,insecticides, and herbicides.SIC 289This group includes manufacturers of miscellaneous chemical products. For1985, SIC 289 represents 7 percent ($14.6 billion) of the value of shipmentsof SIC 28. From 1981 to 1985, the value of shipments in SIC 289 increased15.5 percent. The number of employees in SIC 289 was almost 10 percentof SIC 28 and has remained unchanged since 1981. The number of establishmentsin SIC 289 was approximately 19 percent of all establishments in SIC 28.Production workers equaled approximately 62 percent of all workers [TableII-1].SIC 2891 includes manufacturers of industrial and household adhesives andsealants. Industry shipments for adhesives and sealants in 1986 amountedto $4.2 billion, of which about 60 percent were by synthetic resins andrubber-based adhesives; 20 percent by sealant and caulking compounds; andthe remaining 20 percent by natural-based adhesives and miscellaneous compounds[2, p. 15-3].SIC 2892 includes manufacturers of explosives, such as TNT (Trinitrotoluene).Ethylene glycol dinitrate is one of the products of this SIC which mayhave potential exposure problems. SIC 2893 includes manufacturers of printingink, whereas SIC 2895 includes manufacturers of carbon black. SIC 2899includes manufacturers of miscellaneous chemical products, not elsewhereclassified. Among these three SICs, ethylene glycol, nitrotoluene, hexyleneglycol, trimellitic anhydride, and coal dust are all substances with suspectedexposure problems that are either produced or used in these sectors.SIC 29_Petroleum and Related IndustriesThis industry is divided into petroleum refiners and producers of otherrelated products. Petroleum refineries (SIC 2911) produce fuels (such asgasoline, kerosene, and distillate and residual fuel oils) as well as lubricantsand chemical feedstocks. These products are produced through straight distillationof crude oil, redistillation of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking,or other processes. Other producers in this sector manufacture asphaltand tar products for paving and roofing (SIC 295) and other lubricatingoils, greases, and petroleum and coal products (SIC 299) [1, pp. 127-128].The 1985 value of shipments for SIC 29 ($179.1 billion) was 7.9 percentof the value of shipments for all manufacturing industries. Petroleum refiningdominates SIC 29, accounting for 94 percent of this sector's value of shipments[2, pp. 10-8 to 10-14].The number and size distribution of establishments in SIC 29 are shownin Table II-1, as is total employment. Relative to value of output, SIC29 has few establishments and low employment, accounting for less than1 percent of all manufacturing establishments and employment [6, pp. 10,30].About 40 percent of the establishments in SIC 29 are petroleum refineries[9], which are large and extremely capital intensive. Production is highlyautomated; enclosed processes are used throughout. Mean employment sizeis 105 employees. By contrast, plants in the other industries within SIC29 are relatively small and less capital intensive, and processes are generallynot automated. Mean establishment size in the rest of SIC 29 is 19 employees.The general pattern of firms in SIC 29 in the 1980s has been one of decline.The real value of petroleum product shipments, consumption of petroleumproducts, petroleum refining capacity, and employment in SIC 29 all peakedbetween 1977 and 1981. There has been an upturn since 1985, resulting principallyfrom a sharp decline in crude oil prices in the first half of 1986, whichstimulated demand for refinery products [4; 2, pp. 10-1 and 10-2]. Demandfor petroleum products is expected to grow only slightly in the short runand to show little long-run growth. In the past, trends have been stronglyinfluenced by sharp fluctuations in the price of crude oil [2, pp. 10-3and 10-4].In 1985, imports of refined petroleum products were $18.2 billion, whichreflects both the price of crude oil and the volume of imports. The volumeof imports is itself strongly influenced by the price of crude oil, sincelow prices of crude oil tend to reduce imports of refined petroleum productsby making domestic refineries more competitive in the production of gasoline.Import penetration has been erratic [2, pp. 10-1 and 10-3].The profitability of firms in SIC 29 is low. The median 1985 rate of returnon assets (4.4 percent) is the second lowest median return on assets ofall 20 two-digit manufacturing industries [5].SIC 30_Rubber and Miscellaneous Plastics Products IndustryThis industry sector consists of establishments that manufacture a varietyof products from plastic resins and from natural, synthetic, and reclaimedrubber. Although plastic products account for the largest share of thevalue of shipments of this industry group, the industry also manufacturesa variety of rubber products, including tires, inner tubes, footwear, andbelting [1, pp. 129-132]. The value of shipments for 1985 was $71.3 billion.This industry is dominated by the miscellaneous plastic products sector(SIC 307 until 1987 and now SIC 308), which accounts for 81 percent ofthe establishments, 66 percent of the value of shipments, and 70 percentof the employment for the entire industry group [9]. The tire and innertube (SIC 301) sector and miscellaneous rubber products (SIC 306) sectorare the other major components of this industry.Similar processes are used in manufacturing plastic and rubber products,with the nature and form of the final product determining the process morethan the product's components. A product's components, however, determinethe types of chemical exposures employees experience. Examples of particularlyserious types of exposures are those to the foaming agents that are usedin the production of foam rubber or plastic foams and to the styrene usedto produce polystyrene or for lamination processes.As shown in Table II-1, the industry sector has relatively small establishments,61 percent of which have fewer than 20 employees, with an average of 43employees per establishment. Employment in this industry grew by 7 percentbetween 1981 and 1985, with growth in the tire and inner tube and miscellaneousplastic product sectors balancing declines in other sectors [4].Firms in this industry have above-average profits for manufacturing industries,with a 7.7 percent median rate of return on assets compared with a 7.0percent median for all manufacturing firms [5].SIC 31_Leather and Leather ProductsThe leather and leather products industry (SIC 31) consists of severalsectors such as leather tanning (SIC 311), non-rubber footwear (SIC 314),and luggage and leather goods (SIC 315-319), [1, pp. 133-135]. Shipmentsof leather products and employment in the leather industry have been decliningsteadily over the past several years, due mainly to the worsening importsituation [2, p. 43-1].According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the 1985 value of shipmentsfor leather and leather products ($8.6 billion) was down 8.2 percent from1984. The total represents 0.4 percent of the value of shipments for allmanufacturing industries. Non-rubber footwear (SIC 314) makes up most ofthe value of shipments in this industry with 51.9 percent of the totalvalue [3]. The median return on assets in 1985 for the leather and leatherproduct industry was 6.3 percent [5].The number of establishments in the leather tanning and finishing industry(SIC 311) has decreased by over 244 establishments, from 384 establishmentsin 1982 to 140 establishments in 1986. Employment and shipments have alsodecreased significantly. Since the leather tanning industry is highly dependenton the demand from the non-rubber footwear industry, it is not likely thatthe situation will improve in the near future [2, pp. 43-1 and 43-2].The footwear, luggage, and handbag industry (SIC 31, other than 311) hashad reductions in sales over the past few years. The non-rubber footwearindustry has suffered substantially since 1981 when an import restraintagreement with South Korea and Taiwan expired. Since then, import's shareof the domestic market has increased to over 80 percent. In the last fewyears, production, employment, and domestic shipments have declined substantially[2, p. 43-5].The luggage and leather goods industry has also seen declines in production,employment, and shipments over the past several years. Imports reachedover 52 percent of the domestic market in 1986. Employment has also beendeclining over the past few years, from 42,000 total employees in 1984to 37,400 total employees in 1986 [2, pp. 43-12 and 13].SIC 32_Stone, Clay, Glass and Concrete ProductsThis industry is made up of products such as cement (SIC 324), concrete(SIC 327), pottery (SIC 326), stone (SIC 328), glass (SIC 321-323), andclay brick (SIC 325). Since these products are primarily used as constructionmaterials, the industry is heavily dependent on the amount of new constructionactivity in a given year.There were 21,054 establishments in the stone, clay and glass industry(SIC 32) in 1985. Most of these firms (73.7) percent) employed fewer than20 people in 1985. The mean establishment size was 28 workers. Total employmentwas 588,000 in 1985, a decrease of 0.8 percent over the 1984 total employmentfigure of 593,000 [6].In 1985, the value of shipments in SIC 32 increased 3.1 percent over 1984.The total value was 2.4 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturingindustries. The value of shipments is evenly distributed over the entireindustry, except for the concrete sector (SIC 327) with 35.4 percent ofshipments [3]. The median rate of return on assets for SIC 32 was 6.5 percentin 1985 [5].The concrete industry (SIC 327) has seen considerable improvement in production,employment, and demand in the past several years. The demand for concretehas increased substantially since 1982, when shipments were 23 percentbelow their current figure. Imports are not a significant factor when dealingwith concrete. Since concrete demand depends mainly on non-residentialbuilding construction, the demand for concrete should decrease slightlyin the near future [2, pp. 2-4 to 2-9].The glass industry (SICs 321-323) has experienced steady growth over thepast two years, mainly in production and shipments. New product introductionshave allowed the glass industry to make substantial gains in winning marketshare. The outlook for continued growth for the glass industry is good[2, pp. 2-9 to 2-12].Shipments of clay bricks (SIC 325-326) have increased substantially overthe past few years, from 6.2 billion bricks in 1983 to 7.3 billion bricksin 1986. The outlook for the industry is for slow growth in the near future[2, pp. 2-12, 13].SIC 33_Primary Metal IndustriesThe primary metal industry (SIC 33) is divided into two different sectors:Nonferrous metals and foundries (SIC 333-336) and ferrous metals and foundries(SIC 331-332) [1, pp. 145-152]. This includes the basic iron and steelindustry, and the metals industry. Both sectors have been hurt in the recentpast by a decline in domestic consumption and the growing number of importsinto the United States. The future for these industries, however, looksbrighter due to an increase in orders, slowing imports, and a decreasein capacity [10]. These industries have had increases in prices, shipments,and profits in 1987 and 1988, helped by the fall in the dollar.As seen in Table II-1, the number of establishments in SIC 33 in 1985 totaled10,101. The majority of these had fewer than 20 employees in 1985. Totalemployment (808,000 employees in 1985) and production employment (612,000in 1985) have declined over the last several years, while the average hourlywage of production workers has increased by 2.2 percent from 1984 to 1985[6]. The mean establishment size was 80 workers.Production in the steel mill products industry has declined over the pastfew years, from 88.3 million tons in 1985 to 84.0 million tons in 1986,a decline of 4.9 percent. The 1985 value of shipments ($110.3 billion)in SIC 33 was 4.8 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturingindustries [3]. The median rate of return on assets in 1985 was 5.5 percentfor the primary metal industry [5].The outlook for the steel industry is brighter than just a few years ago.In 1987, the industry is expected to have its first profitable year since1981. This is due mainly to the large decrease in capacity and employmentthat the industry has implemented over the last several years. The industryhas cut costs of production while prices have remained steady.The import situation has also improved for the steel industry, due in partto the falling value of the dollar against major competitors such as Japanand Europe. Over the past few years, imports of steel mill products tooka large share of the domestic market, an increase of 7.7 percent in themarket share from 1979 to 1984. Exports declined during the same time periodby 13.7 percent [2, pp. 19-1 to 19-9].The ferrous castings industry (SIC 332) has shown a poor performance overthe past few years. The value of shipments has been steadily decreasing,from $10.8 billion in 1985 to $10.1 billion in 1986, a decline of 7.3 percent.The value of shipments for SIC 332 is forecast to increase 7.1 percentin 1987, although this trend is not likely to continue in the future. Totalemployment and the number of production workers has also fallen since theearly 1980's, by 9.7 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively, from 1979to 1984 [2, pp. 19-1 to 19-9].Nonferrous metals can be classified as four primary metals: aluminum, zinc,lead, and copper. The aluminum industry has had mixed progress when itcomes to improving their industry. Shipments have increased steadily inthe past few years, with a 3.3 percent increase in 1986. The aluminum industrydoes experience a cost disadvantage due in part to its high electricalcosts. Most aluminum producers use very high levels of electricity in theirproduction processes; costs of production fluctuate with electrical utilitycosts. The industry faces potentially higher electricity rates relatedto legislative bills designed to reduce acid rain depositions producedby coal burning utilities. The enactment of such legislation is projectedto increase power rates to aluminum smelters by over 10 percent.The zinc industry should have steady growth over the next few years, duemainly to a decline in capacity and an increase in consumption. This hascaused the price of zinc to rise, although rather slowly, Domestic consumptionwas still expected to increase to 960,000 tons in 1987. The value of shipmentsdeclined by 18.8 percent in 1986, but it is expected to increase by 7.7percent in 1987. Total employment and the number of production workershas remained steady for the past several years.The lead industry has had slow growth over the past few years, due mainlyto a decline in demand from products such as gasoline and automobile batteries.Consumption is expected to increase slightly by a modest 2.1 percent in1987, but to continue increasing into the 1990's. Industry production shouldalso increase slowly, about 2 percent a year for the next few years [2,pp. 20-6 to 20-18].The copper industry has been undergoing restructuring to remain competitivein the world market. This has forced the industry to decrease capacityand reduce employment [2, pp. 20-6 to 20-18]. The price of copper has beendriven up recently due to a decline in inventories. This should allow theindustry to turn a significant profit for the first time in several years.SIC 34_Fabricated Metal ProductsThe fabricated metal products industry (SIC 34) consists of several differentgroups: Metal cans and shipping containers (SIC 341); cutlery and handtools (SIC 342); heating equipment (SIC 343); fabricated structural metalproducts (SIC 344); screw machine products, bolts, and washers (SIC 345);forgings and stampings (SIC 346); plating and coating (SIC 347); smallarms and ordinance (SIC 348); and miscellaneous wire and fabricated products(SIC 349). SIC 34 excludes machinery and transportation equipment [1, pp.153-166].The total number of establishments in the fabricated metal products industryin 1985 was 46,322. The majority of these firms (67.0 percent) employ fewerthan 20 people, a change of 0.2 percent since 1984. Total employment inthis industry has reached 1.465 million employees, an increase of 0.1 percentsince 1984 [6].The 1985 value of shipments for SIC 34 represents a 2.7 percent increaseover 1984. This was 6.1 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturingindustries [3]. The median return on assets for the fabricated metal productsindustry in 1985 was 7.1 percent [5].Metal cans (SIC 3411) shipments have been increasing steadily in the pastfew years, from 92.3 billion units in 1983 to 105.0 billion units in 1986,an increase of over 13.75 percent. This was due mainly to the increasein soft drink and beer cans being shipped. The value of shipments has alsoincreased with a compound annual increase of 3.3 percent from 1979 to 1984.Total employment in the metal cans industry has remained steady with onlya slight decrease expected in 1987. The number of production workers hasincreased slightly with an increase of 0.3 percent from 1985 to 1986. Exportsof metal cans have decreased substantially since 1984 when they reachedan all-time high of $56.5 million. Since that time they have decreasedto $37.5 million in 1986 [2, pp. 6-1 to 6-4].The fabricated structural metal industry (SIC 3441) produces structuralmetal components used primarily in the construction industry. Shipmentsof fabricated structural metal increased 8.0 percent from 1984 to 1985,from $7.5 billion to $8.1 billion in 1985. Total employment has been increasingslowly at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, while the number of productionworkers has been increasing at an annual rate of 1.4 percent [2, pp. 2-3,4].The value of shipments in the screw machine products, bolts, and washersindustry (SIC 345) decreased slightly from 1984 to 1987, from $7.5 billionto $7.3 billion. Total employment also decreased from 96,200 in 1984 to95,600 in 1986. Since the automotive industry is the major customer forthis industry, stable automotive sales are the key to economic health forthis industry sector [2, pp. 24-1 to 24-6].SIC 35_Non-Electrical MachineryThe non-electrical machinery industry (SIC 35) is made up of several differentsectors: Miscellaneous machinery (SIC 351-356); computer and office equipment(SIC 357); refrigeration and service industry machinery (SIC 358); andmiscellaneous machinery and equipment (SIC 359 [1, pp. 167-183].As seen in Table II-1, the number of establishments in 1985 totaled 77,748.The majority of these (77.1 percent) had fewer than 20 employees in 1985.Total employment and production employment have decreased over the lastseveral years. The 1985 value of shipments ($215.1 billion) in SIC 35 was9.4 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturing industries[3]. In 1985, the median rate of return on assets for SIC 35 was 7.5 percent[5].Miscellaneous machinery (SICs 351-356) has been experiencing an increasein shipment over the past few years. In 1984, the value of shipments was$113.5 billion and since then it has increased to $114.0 billion in 1985.The majority of this increase was from metalworking machinery, which increasedfrom $18.6 billion in 1984 to $19.7 billion in 1985, an increase of 5.7percent. Total employment in this sector has been declining from 1,153,500workers in 1984 to 1,117,400 workers in 1985 [2, pp. 23-1 to 23-17, 25-1to 25-5, and 21-1 to 21-17].The computer industry (SIC 357) has been facing stagnant demand for itsproducts in the U.S. market [11]. The value of shipments of electroniccomputing equipment (SIC 3573) has decreased from $53.5 billion in 1984to $49.2 billion in 1986, a decline of 8.0 percent. Total employment andthe number of production workers have also declined since 1984 by 15.5percent and 27.8 percent, respectively. Imported computer equipment havemade significant inroads into the domestic market, due mainly to the standardizationof products and the fall in price of computer equipment [2, pp. 28-1 to28-10].The refrigeration and service machinery industry (SIC 358) has had exceptionalperformance since 1984, with a compound annual rate of growth of 5.1 percentfrom 1979 to 1984. This is due mainly to the increase in new residentialconstruction. Total employment and the number of production workers havealso been increasing substantially, although this trend slowed in 1986,probably due to the trade situation. Imports have been steadily increasing,while exports have been decreasing at a steady rate [2, pp. 22-9 to 22-11].SIC 36_Electric and Electronic EquipmentThis industry is made up of several distinct sectors: Transformers andswitchgear (SIC 361); electrical industrial apparatus (SIC 362); householdappliances (SIC 363); electrical lighting and wiring (SIC 364); consumerelectronics and communications equipment (SIC 365-366); electronic componentsand accessories (SIC 367); and miscellaneous electrical equipment and machinery(SIC 369) [1, pp. 184-195].There were approximately 28,478 establishments in the electric and electronicequipment industry in 1985, employing over 2 million workers. The majorityof these firms (62.4 percent) had fewer than 20 employees. The value ofshipments for all electric and electronic equipment establishments in 1986was $192.7 billion. This was 8.4 percent of the value of shipments forall manufacturing industries. Most of the value of shipments in SIC 36is from the communication equipment sector (33.9 percent) [3]. The medianreturn on assets for the electric and electronic equipment industry was7.9 percent in 1985 [5]. The transformer and switchgear industry (SIC 361) has had mixed performancein the last year. While the value of shipments increased for switchgearby 2.5 percent, the value of shipments for transformers decreased by 1.9percent from 1985 to 1986. Total employment and the number of productionworkers has remained fairly steady since the early 1980's [2, pp. 26-1to 26-4]. The electrical industrial apparatus industry (SIC 362) is facing an uncertainfuture. The value of shipments for this industry has remained fairly steadyover the past few years, but shipments in the future are predicted to declinedue to weak demand from the automotive industry. Total employment has alreadybegun to decline from 190,300 in 1984 to 178,900 in 1985, a decreases of6.0 percent. The majority of the industry has been forced to cut operatingcosts to compensate for the reduced demand [2, pp. 26-4 to 26-6]. The household appliance industry (SIC 363) has had a steady increase insales since the early 1980's, from $12.6 billion in 1982 to $15.2 billionin 1986, an increase of 19.98 percent [12]. The industry is optimisticabout its future, due mainly to the increased residential constructionand the increase in disposable income. Imports have not been a substantialburden on this industry, although exports have not increased substantiallyeither. Total employment and the number of production workers have declinedfrom 1984 to 1986 by 9.1 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively. This declinein employment is due to the recent number of acquisitions within the industryand the need to cut costs of production [2, pp. 44-5 to 44-9]. The value of shipments for the electrical lighting and wiring industry(SIC 364) has been increasing steadily over the last decade, from 11,321in 1980 to 15,806 in 1985, an increase of 39.6 percent. Total employmentand the number of production workers have decreased, although at a slowrate. Performance in this industry is due, in part, to the good performanceof the construction industry. Since the electrical lighting and wiringindustry depends on both residential and non-residential construction,they are able to withstand a slowdown in one sector as long as the othersector is still profitable [2, pp. 3-2 to 3-5]. The consumer electronics and communication equipment industry (SICs 365-366)has had mixed performance over the past few years. While the communicationequipment industry has performed well in the past, the consumer electronicsindustry has not performed as well, due to the large import volume in thisindustry. Overall, the value of industry shipments has remained fairlystable, with shipments increasing in the communication equipment industryand shipments decreasing in the consumer electronics industry. Total employmentand the number of production workers also follow this pattern, decreasingfor consumer electronics and increasing for communication equipment [2,pp. 29-1 to 29-5 and 44-9 to 44-15]. The electronic components and accessories industry (SIC 367) is expectedto show record growth over the next few years. Industry shipments wereup 8.1 percent, from $39.7 billion in 1986 to $43.0 billion in 1987. Thiswas due, in part, to the strong performance of the defense electronicsindustry. The number of production workers and total employment has remainedfairly steady in 1986 and 1987. Imports are still increasing, but may beslowed due to the fall in the value of the dollar [2, pp. 32-1 to 32-4].SIC 37_Transportation Equipment This industry sector includes establishments engaged in manufacturing equipmentfor land, sea, air, space transportation and includes manufacturers ofparts and accessories as well as complete vehicles. The major subdivisions within this sector are motor vehicles and motorvehicle equipment (SIC 371), aircraft and parts (SIC 372), ship and boatbuilding and repair (SIC 373), railroad equipment (SIC 374), motorcycles,bicycles and parts (SIC 375), guided missiles, space vehicles and parts(SIC 376), and miscellaneous transportation equipment (SIC 379). Establishmentsin the miscellaneous subdivision manufacture a broad range of products(e.g., from tanks to wheelbarrows) [1, pp. 196-201]. Because the manufactureof transportation equipment involves a wide range of industrial processes,establishments in this sector often include or involve foundries, electroplatingoperations, various types of hot metal work, welding, laminating, plasticmolding, and painting and coating. Thus workers may be exposed to the chemicalsgenerated by a broad variety of processes. Although the transportation equipment industry includes both very smalland very large establishments, it has an unusual number of very large establishmentsthat have thousands of employees. These very large establishments are mostlikely to be found in plants that produce final equipment on a mass-productionbasis (e.g., automobile plants, aircraft plants, or tank assembly lines).There is still a place in this industry, however, for smaller establishments,and, as shown in Table II-1, 68 percent of all establishments have fewerthan 20 employees. Because foreign competition plays an important role in this sector, theprosperity of the industry fluctuates with business cycles and with thevalue of the dollar. Employment in this industry declined between 1981and 1982 but had recovered to the 1981 level by 1984 and had increasedanother 4 percent by 1985 [4]. The value of shipments for SIC 37 was $301.4 billion in 1985. The averagefirm in this industry had a 7.3 percent return on assets in 1985, whichis slightly above the median of 7.0 for firms in all manufacturing industries.Some sectors within the two-digit industries had significantly lower returnson assets, although no major component of the industry had a return onassets below 4 percent in 1985 [5]. SIC 38_Measuring, Analyzing and Controlling Instruments SIC 38 includes manufacturers of instruments used to measure, test, analyzeand control. It also includes optical instruments and lenses; surveyingand drafting instruments; hydrological, hydrographic, meteorological, andgeophysical equipment; search, detection, navigation, and guidance systemsand equipment; surgical, medical, and dental instruments, equipment, andsupplies; ophthalmic goods; photographic equipment and supplies; and watchesand clocks [1, p. 243]. The industries in this SIC rely heavily on research and development activities(Randamp;D) of other industries for sales of their products. According tothe U.S. Department of Commerce, increases in research and developmentexpenditures by industry and government in 1986 caused increases in salesof scientific and industrial instruments. High tech firms, which representa large portion of SIC 38's product market, are the largest investors inresearch and development, where Randamp;D expenditures are measured as apercentage of gross sales. Firms producing semiconductors, computers andrelated equipment, office equipment, and software, among others, were majorsources of Randamp;D funds in 1986. The pharmaceutical and chemical industriesalso have relied on Randamp;D to a large extent. In addition, the declinein the price of oil, which raises profits by lowering production costs,is expected to further stimulate Randamp;D expenditures by the chemical industry[2, p. 33-1]. Similarly, government outlays for Randamp;D increased in 1986 by more than9 percent in current dollars. Most of the Randamp;D expenditures, however,were for defense-related research. In addition, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA) is expected to invest in new instrumentationfor the redesign of the space shuttle and other rocket systems [2, p. 33-4].According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the value of shipments in1985 ($61 billion) increased almost 26 percent since 1981. Between 1981and 1985, SIC 38 experienced a 1 percent loss in employment. Of all employees,54.4 percent working in SIC 38 were production workers [4]. In 1985, themedian rate of return on assets in this SIC was 7.3 percent [5]. From 1981 to 1985, the value of shipments for SICs 383 and 384 experiencedgrowth, rising 60 and 54.3 percent, respectively. SIC 383 comprises 8 percentof the total value of shipments in SIC 38, while SIC 384 represents 23percent. In contrast, SIC 387 experienced a drop of 36 percent in the valueof shipments, representing only 1.5 percent of the total value of shipmentsin SIC 38 [5]. SIC 39_Miscellaneous Manufacturing Industries In any classification scheme, some items inevitably fall outside the scheme.In manufacturing, these miscellaneous industries are included in SIC 39,which contains five three-digit industries that are as dissimilar fromone another as is usually the case at the two-digit level in other manufacturingsectors. Most of the industries in SIC 39 produce discretionary durableconsumer goods, some of which are luxury goods. Establishments that cannotbe grouped together even at the three-digit level are included in SIC 399.At the three-digit level, miscellaneous manufacturing industries includeproducers of jewelry, silverware, and plated ware (SIC 391); musical instruments(SIC 393); toys and sporting goods (SIC 394); pens, pencils, office andart supplies (SIC 394); and costume jewelry and notions (SIC 396). A sixthcategory, miscellaneous manufactures (SIC 399), includes producers of broomsand brushes, signs and advertising displays, burial caskets, hard surfacefloor coverings, and manufacturing industries ``not elsewhere classified''[1, pp. 211-218]. The number of establishments and employment in SIC 39 are shown in TableII-1. Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of these employees are productionworkers. Establishments in SIC 39 are generally far smaller than those in manufacturingas a whole, with higher proportions of employees concentrated in smallestablishments. The mean size of establishments is 11 employees, with 85percent of establishments having fewer than 20 employees, compared withless than 65 percent for manufacturing establishments as a whole. Relativelyfew establishments in SIC 39 have 100 or more employees [6]. Miscellaneous manufactures (SIC 399) has the largest share (more than one-third)of the value of shipments for SIC 39 ($26.5 billion in 1985) [3, vol. 1:8, 22, 24]. The SIC 39 industries were generally hard hit by the 1982 recession.Substantial import competition, aided by the strength of the dollar, hasimpeded the recovery of many of these industries since 1982, and the importshare of new supply doubled between 1980 and 1985 in many industries. Importsaccount for nearly 60 percent of the new supply of sporting and athleticgoods and between one-quarter and three-eighths of new supply in many otherindustries. The recent decline of the dollar has tended to halt or reverseimport penetration to varying degrees [2, pp. 45-2 to 45-11; 46-10 to 46-13];however, domestic production in SIC 39 will also be affected by the tendencyof the doll and toy sector to move offshore [2, pp. 45-2 to 45-11; 46-120to 46-12]. Generally, this cyclical pattern also is found in this industry at themore disaggregated level. In the latest cycle, the peak-to-trough declineof production, employment, and real value of shipments in many of theseindustries was between 10 and 25 percent. In some cases (particularly inmusical instruments and toys and sporting goods), production and/or employmentdeclined by as much as half. Exceptions to this pattern, however, can befound in the manufacture of dolls, sporting and athletic goods, and costumejewelry, where the real value of shipments grew steadily despite the businesscycle. (The apparent contradiction between from this growth and declinein production and employment results from the movement offshore of productionfacilities of domestic companies.) In miscellaneous manufacturing (SIC399), 1986 employment was 15 percent above the previous peak, making thisthe only three-digit industry to regain the peak level [5, 2, pp. 45-3to 45-11; 46-11 to 46-13]. In terms of profitability, the majority of industries in SIC 39 are moreprofitable than most manufacturing industries. The median 1985 rate ofreturn on assets (8.0 percent) is the second highest median return on assetsof all two-digit manufacturing industries. Median rates of return for four-digitindustries within this sector range from 3.4 percent to 9.5 percent [5].SIC 40_Railroad Transportation SIC 40 includes establishments that provide line-haul railroad transportation,and switching and terminal establishments. General authority for the workingconditions at railroad operations is vested in the Federal Railroad Administration.For the most part, OSHA's standards apply only to off-track operationssuch as shops and servicing areas. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimatesthat in 1986, there were 23 individual Class I railroads (those with operatingrevenues of $50 million or more in 1987 dollars), which accounted for over95 percent of the freight tonnage handled by the railroad industry. Theindustry also includes about 480 smaller carriers, including shortlinesand switching and terminal companies. The 1986 operating revenue for therailroad industry was estimated as $26.5 billion (1982 dollars), representingan annual loss of about 4 percent. Revenue ton miles were estimated as880 billion, which represents less than a 1 percent rate of growth [2,p. 55-8]. Between 1980 and 1985, the industries in SIC 40 experienced aserious economic decline, as indicated by the fact that it was the secondslowest growing SIC (behind SIC 10, metal mining), and third highest interms of employment losses (behind SIC 33, primary metals and SIC 35, heavymachinery). During this period, employment declined by approximately 27percent [2, pp. 13-14]. The median rate of return on assets in 1985 was4.4 percent [5]. SIC 45_Air Transportation This SIC includes establishments that provide domestic and foreign transportationby air and also those that operate airports and flying fields and provideterminal services. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Departmentof Transportation, enforces rules and regulations governing the safetyand health of flight and cabin crew of aircraft in flight. In general,the FAA also has jurisdiction over airline maintenance and ground supportpersonnel. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. airlineindustry consists of approximately 250 individual commercial air carriersoperating over 4,500 aircraft and employing over 355,000 people. In 1985,the industry served 380 million passengers and operated 6 billion cargoton-miles. Twelve major carriers account for 84 percent of all revenuepassenger miles. (The U.S. Department of Commerce defines a major carrieras having at least $1 billion in annual revenue, in 1982 dollars.) Theremaining passenger revenue is shared by 16 carriers classified as nationals(each with annual revenues between $75 million and $1 billion in 1982 dollars),which account for about 12 percent, and by the regionals/commuters, whichaccount for 4 percent. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated the 1986operating revenue for the airlines industry as $49 billion (1982 dollars),representing an annual growth rate of about 4.9 percent. Revenue passengermiles were estimated as 363 billion, which represents an 8 percent rateof growth [2, p. 55-1]. In 1985, the median rate of return on assets inthis sector was 4.3 percent [5]. SIC 47_Transportation Services SIC 47 includes establishments that furnish services related to transportation.Activities classified in SIC 47 include freight forwarding, arranging transportationfor passengers and freight, renting railroad cars, inspection and weighingservices; and freight car loading [1, pp. 280-281]. According to the U.S.Department of Commerce, between 1980 and 1985, SIC 47 was the third-fastestgrowing industry group behind SIC 62 (Securities) and SIC 73 (BusinessServices) [2, pp. 13-14]. Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 47 experienced a 31percent increase in employment. Table II-1 presents employment and establishmentdata for SIC 47. The median return on assets in this SIC was 7.1 percent[5]. SIC 49_Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services SIC 49 includes establishments that generate, transmit, and/or distributeelectricity, gas, or steam. These establishments may be combinations ofany of these services, but also may include other types of services, suchas transportation, communications, refrigeration and pipelines for naturalgas. Water and irrigation systems, and sanitary systems that collect anddispose of garbage, sewage, and other wastes, also are included in thisSIC [1, p. 284]. The utilities covered in SIC 49 have been undergoing many changes in thepast few years. The utilities have been in a state of transition due toongoing changes in regulations regarding utility rates and competition.Some industrial customers have begun producing their own energy and utilitiesare now competing for customers outside their service areas. This competitionhas forced structural changes in the industry, especially diversification.Utilities have been forced to upgrade their overall efficiency. With declininginterest rates, regulators have been decreasing the allowed rate of returnfor utilities. This, too, has led to intensified pressures on competition[13, p. 56]. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is currently consideringwhether to allow utilities to open their power lines to other competingutilities. Users would be given the choice of suppliers. With the decreasingrate of return and the increasing competition, utilities have stepped upefficiency in order to offset the impending drop in their profit margins[14, p. 48]. Table II-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 49 for 1985.Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 49 experienced a 6 percent growth in employment.In 1985, almost 80 percent of all employees were production workers [4].The median return on assets was 4.0 percent [5]. Within this SIC, there are seven three-digit SICs, including establishmentsthat generate, transmit, or distribute electrical energy for sale and thatoperate crude petroleum and natural gas field properties; establishmentsthat transmit and or store natural gas for sale; establishments that provideelectric or gas services in combination with other services, only if oneservice does not constitute 95 percent or more of revenues; establishmentsthat distribute water for sale for domestic, commercial, and industrialuse; establishments that collect and dispose of wastes conducted througha sewer system, including such treatment processes as may be provided;establishments that produce and/or distribute steam and heated or cooledair for sale; and establishments that operate water supply systems forthe purpose of irrigation [1, pp. 284-286]. SIC 50 and SIC 51_Wholesale Trade The wholesale trade sector includes establishments engaged in the wholesaleselling of merchandise to retailers; industrial, commercial, institutional,farm, or business users; or to other wholesalers or firms that act as agentsor brokers in the wholesale buying or selling of merchandise. Wholesaletrade is divided into trade in durable goods (SIC 50) and in nondurablegoods (SIC 51). This analysis focuses only on a few of the wholesale tradeindustries (e.g., dealers in scrap and waste materials, SIC 5093; grain,SIC 5153; chemicals and allied products, SIC 5161; farm supplies, SIC 5191;and paints, varnishes, and supplies, SIC 5198 [1, pp. 241, 250, 255-257].In addition to the types of worker exposures associated with materialshandling and receiving, some industries engage in other activities thatcan lead to significant chemical exposures. For example, assembling, breakingup, and sorting scrap and waste materials (SIC 5093) and storing grain(SIC 5153) are activities that can lead to exposures. Wholesale trade sales ($1,375 billion in 1985) were fairly equally dividedbetween durable goods and nondurable goods_46 percent and 54 percent, respectively[2, p. 56-1]. Of the approximately 425,000 establishments in wholesaletrade, about five-eighths were in durable goods, and three-eighths werein nondurable goods. The specific four-digit industries studied for thisanalysis include about 11 percent of all wholesale trade establishments[3, pp. 59, 62, 64-65]. Table II-1 shows employment data at the four-digit level. Somewhat lessthan 60 percent of total employment in wholesale trade is in durable goods,while a little more than 40 percent is in nondurable goods. The specificfour-digit industries being analyzed here account for less than 9 percentof all employment in wholesale trade [6]. SIC 55_Automotive Dealers and Service Stations This industry sector includes retailers of transportation equipment forpersonal use (new and used automobiles) as well as recreational vehicles(boats, motor homes, and dune buggies); sellers of automobile parts andaccessories; and gasoline stations. Although it does not include establishmentswhose primary business is automotive repair, it does include repair operationsthat are part of automobile dealerships or service stations. Only thoseretail outlets that earn more than 50 percent of their revenues from gasolineor lubricating oil sales are included. Many car washes and conveniencestores that sell gasoline are excluded, as are traditional full-servicegas stations that earn more than 50 percent of their revenues from suchactivities as repairs, towing, or the sale of auto accessories [1, pp.265-266]. According to one estimate, this sector includes only 55 percentof all retail motor fuel outlets [15, pp. 6-13]. Although many employeesare involved in selling, some are exposed to chemicals during paintingor stripping or as a result of the indoor operation of engines or the useof solvents. As shown in Table II-1, most establishments are relatively small (80 percenthave fewer than 20 employees). Only in one sector (i.e., new and used automobiledealerships) do more than half of the establishments have more than 19employees [9]. Even in this sector, however, 90 percent of the establishmentshave fewer than 100 employees [4]. Although the typical operation is relativelysmall, total employment is substantial because of the large number of establishments.New and used automobile dealerships account for 48 percent of total employment,gasoline service stations for 31 percent, and automobile and home supplystores for 16 percent. Although many firms own only a single establishment, large firms own asignificant portion of all establishments, which are operated as chainsunder leasing or franchising agreements.The profitability of firms in SIC 55 is below the national average, witha medium return on assets of 5.9 percent in 1985; however, this rate ofreturn improved in 1986 as gasoline prices declined, and new car salesincreased [5].SIC 72_Personal Services and SIC 73_Business ServicesThe personal services industry consists primarily of consumer services.SIC 721, laundry, cleaning and garment services has the highest potentialfor overexposure to chemicals. Other segments of SIC 72 include photographicstudios (SIC 722); beauty shops, barber shops and shoe repair (SIC 723-725);and funeral service and crematories (SIC 726) [1, pp. 298-300].As seen in Table II-1, the number of establishments in 1985 totaled 161,004.Almost all of these (96.9 percent) had fewer than 20 employees in 1985.The mean establishment size was 7 employees. The largest single segmentof this industry is SIC 7231, beauty shops, which totaled 53,165 firmsin 1986 [6]. Total employment (1,056,000 employees in 1985) has increasedover the last several years. In 1986, the value of sales was $39.4 billionin the personal services industry, a 6.6 percent increase over 1985 [16].The median rate of return on assets for the personal services industrywas 10.5 percent in 1985 [5].The business services industry consists of several different sectors. Amongthe sectors included are mailing, reproduction, and commercial art andphotography (SIC 733); building cleaning and maintenance services (SIC734); and miscellaneous business services (SIC 739), such as photofinishinglaboratories and commercial testing laboratories [1, pp. 301-308].The number of establishments in 1985 totaled 382,626. Almost all of these(90.5 percent) had fewer than 20 employees in 1985. The mean establishmentsize was 12 workers. Total employment (4,457,000 employees in 1985) hasincreased over the last several years (4,057,000 employees in 1984) [4].In 1986, the value of sales was $198.7 billion in the business servicesindustry, a 9.2 percent increase over 1985 [16]. The median rate of returnof assets SIC 73 was 11.1 percent in 1985 [5]. SIC 75_Automotive Repair, Services, and GaragesThis sector includes establishments that provide automotive repair, rental,leasing, and parking services to the general public, but excludes gasolinestations (SIC 55) and repair shops that are part of automobile dealershipsor that service commercial fleets [1, p. 309]. Employees may be exposedto engine emissions in parking garages or repair shops, to a variety ofchemical solvents (particularly in painting and stripping), and to dustfrom body work.Eighty-five percent of the establishments are automotive repair shops,which is the sector most likely to have significant chemical exposure,and they employ 61 percent of all industry workers [9]. As shown in TableII-1, SIC 75 is dominated by businesses employing fewer than 20 workers(97 percent) with a median return on assets of 9.2 percent in 1985. Theprofitability of automotive repair and service firms is high, althoughit varies by size and industry sector. Small firms (under $100,000 in assets)had returns of 18.3 percent in 1985, while large businesses (over $1,000,000)had returns of 3.9 percent. Paint shops (SIC 7535) were the most profitabletype of operation, while parking lots (SIC 7523) and parking structures(SIC 7525) registered significantly lower rates of return [5].SIC 76_Miscellaneous RepairThis industry group includes a wide variety of repair services, differentiatedby object repaired and processes used. Industries of particular concerninclude reupholstery and furniture repair (SIC 7641) and welding (SIC 7692)[1, pp. 312-314]. Reupholstery and furniture repair workers may be exposedto nuisance dusts during wood working, and to solvents; welders may beexposed to fumes.Nineteen percent of the 56,000 industry establishments in SIC 76 are inSIC 7641 and SIC 7692. These two industries account for approximately 14percent of all SIC 76 employment [6, pp. 81-82].The industry is made up almost entirely of very small firms, and the sectorhas extremely low concentration. Mean business size is 5.5 employees: morethan 95 percent of all establishments have fewer than 20 employees, and65 percent of all workers are employed by establishments of this size.Only 0.2 percent of all miscellaneous repair establishments (with about6 percent of total employment) have 100 or more employees, and only 17establishments have 250 or more. The four-digit industries of concern areeven more completely dominated by small establishments, with a mean sizeof 4.8 employees in SIC 7641 and 3.4 employees in SIC 7692 [6, pp. 81-82].Despite a slight decline in 1981 and 1982, employment in SIC 76 has grownfairly steadily since the 1975 recession, increasing by 23 percent between1979 and 1984 and by 7 percent between 1984 and 1986. More than 98 percentof all workers are neither administrative nor clerical [4].Miscellaneous repair firms have high profit rates. The median 1985 rateof return on assets in SIC 76 is 10.0 percent. This rate of return is higherthan that of any two-digit manufacturing industry. The median rates ofreturn on assets in SIC 7641 and SIC 7692 are over 11 percent [5].SIC 80_Health ServicesThe health services industry encompasses a broad range of medical, surgical,and other health services, both public and commercially owned. These servicesare provided by a variety of practitioners (e.g., physicians, dentists,osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, optometrists) at a variety of facilities(e.g., hospitals, nursing facilities, outpatient care facilities, medicallaboratories) [1, pp. 321-323]. Total expenditures on health care and medical services ($425 billion in1985) are very large, with 40 percent of this amount going to hospitalcare and 20 percent to physicians' services. Expenditures on nursing homecare, drugs and medical sundries, and dentists' services each accountedfor 6 to 8 percent of all health and medical services expenditures [2,p. 54-1]. Data on health care establishments are shown in Table II-1. Although thenumber of health service establishments (313,000) is very large, 85 percentof these are offices of licensed practitioners. No other three-digit sectorwithin the health services industry accounts for more than 4 percent ofhealth service establishments, and only about 2.7 percent (i.e., 1,500establishments) are hospitals.Total health services employment is very large (6.3 million), with hospitalsaccounting for almost half (i.e., 48 percent) of this workforce. Becauseof their large numbers, practitioners' offices are next in percentage ofworkforce employed (24 percent), followed by nursing and personal carehomes (18 percent). Mean establishment sizes range from six or fewer employeesin practitioners' offices to 250 or more employees in hospitals. The overallmean size of establishments in this industry is 20 employees, with morethan 91 percent of these establishments having fewer than 20 employees,and approximately 22 percent of all SIC 80 employees working in establishmentof this size. SIC 80 facilities with more than 250 employees employ morethan 50 percent of the workforce in this sector, and facilities with morethan 100 employees employ more than 60 percent [6; 4].The health and medical services industry has been expanding rapidly formore than a decade. A variety of factors have caused this increase, includingthe expansion of the elderly population, the increasing use of sophisticatedhigh-technology equipment, the expanded treatment of expensive diseases,and the increasing costs of malpractice insurance. In addition, between1985 and 1986, the price for most medical services rose between 6 and 9percent, compared with 1.5 percent increase in consumer prices. The implementationof Medicare's prospective payment system is also causing major changesin the health care industry [2, pp. 54-1,2].Hospital care costs have been a major target of cost-cutting measures,resulting in a decline in hospital admissions, a shortening of hospitalstays, and substantial industry restructuring, including increased mergersand acquisitions by large chains, vertical integration, diversificationof services offered, expanded professional peer review, and more businesslikeoperations. Major investor-owned nursing home chains also have experiencedrapid expansion and acquisition [2, pp. 54-1, 2].For SIC 80 as a whole, the growth rate in expenditures averaged 12.6 percentper year from 1979 to 1984 and more than 9 percent for the next 3 years[2, p. 54-1]. Employment grew by 31 percent between 1979 and 1986, risingby 2 to 5 percent in each year [4]. The growth picture is fairly consistentacross three-digit industries, although expenditures on ``other professionalservices'' have shown the most rapid growth of any health service (16.3percent annually from 1979 to 1984). Expansion has been especially rapidin health maintenance organizations and home health care, both of whichhave the potential for reducing health costs and substituting, to somedegree, for hospital care [2, pp. 54-1 to 54-4].The median rate of return on assets in health services (5.0 percent in1985) is relatively low compared with that in manufacturing industries,and hospitals have somewhat lower median rates of return than is the casefor health services as a whole. Several ``offices'' industries, on theother hand, have median rates of return higher than 13 percent. Medicaland dental laboratories have median rates of return that are above themedian for two-digit manufacturing industries [5].<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 1104-1105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Employee Exposures and Benefits</ITAG>Employee exposures to the substances included in the scope of this rulemakingare associated with a wide variety of acute and chronic illnesses. Theseinclude sensory irritation, narcosis, organs system dysfunction, chronicrespiratory disease, neurological impairment, allergic sensitization, andcancer. Since OSHA's adoption of existing Federal and consensus standardlimits in 1971, toxicologic evidence has become available that shows thatadverse health effects can occur as a consequence of exposure to many ofthe substances listed in OSHA's Z tables, and that such health effectsoccur even when exposures are maintained at the current Z table limits.In addition, many substances that have come into widespread use or beenintroduced since 1971 have been shown to be potentially hazardous in theworkplace environment. OSHA thus believes that reducing worker exposuresto such substances by lowering existing exposure limits or by adding limitsfor previously unregulated substances will result in a significantly reducedrisk of illness to workers. This chapter describes the methodology used to identify workers potentiallyexposed to the hazardous substances included in this rulemaking and theexpected benefits to those workers resulting from lowering permissibleexposure levels. An important existing data base for identifying employeespotentially exposed to hazardous substances was OSHA's Integrated ManagementInformation System. The IMIS data were used to project expected benefitsresulting from lowering permissible exposure levels to the substances beingregulated.The IMIS data base does not include information on all substances and hasmore information on some substances than others. IMIS contained researchinformation on about 160 substances among the approximately 430 substancescovered by the proposal. While the IMIS data base contains the resultsfor over 100,000 samples of substances currently regulated by OSHA, noplant specific information was available for about 200 of the substancesincluded in this rulemaking but currently not regulated by OSHA. To obtainadditional information on employee exposures and on substances not coveredby IMIS, a nationwide survey was begun in January 1988, which was designedto collect worker exposure data at over 5,300 establishments nationwidethat are believed to be affected by this proposal. The survey results includeindustry-sector-specific data on the extent of employee exposures to hazardousmaterials and, in addition, provide specific information on the industrialprocesses in which these substances are used.To assess the benefits of the proposed revision to OSHA's Z-Tables, OSHArelied both on the survey and IMIS data and used two basic approaches.The first approach relies on IMIS data combined with raw survey data toestimate the extent to which employees are currently exposed to substancesincluded in this rulemaking. From this analysis, OSHA estimates the reductionin illness cases and disease-related fatalities associated with reducingexposure limits for these substances. The second approach relies solelyon the use of the imputed survey data base to generate an exposure profile(the imputed survey file was created using statistical procedures to fillin missing responses to particular questions asked in the survey).Description of Data Sources UsedTo assess the quantitative benefits associated with this rulemaking, thefollowing data were used:andbullet; The proposed exposure limits for substances included in the rulemaking;andbullet; Employee exposure data for these substances;andbullet; Employment data for four-digit SIC code for the base year 1985;andbullet; Annual illness and lost workday rates for the base year 1985;andandbullet; Health effects information on the substances included in the rulemaking.Employee exposure data for about 160 substances were obtained from OSHA'sIntegrated Management Information System (IMIS). This data base containsexposure measurements obtained by OSHA compliance officers during the conductof thousands of health inspections. For each facility inspected, the IMISfile includes information on the number of employees at the facility, resultsof employee air monitoring for specific substances, and the number of employeespotentially exposed to each substance monitored. To perform the benefitsasssessment, a summary IMIS file was created that contained the followinginformation:andbullet; A list of substances for which personal 8-hour TWA samples weretaken, by four-digit SIC and facility inspectedandbullet; The number of workers potentially exposed to each substance monitored,by four-digit SIC and facilityandbullet; The number of employees at each facility inspectedandbullet; The total number of personal 8-hour TWA samples obtained for eachsubstance, by four-digit SIC and facilityandbullet; The number of samples taken at each facility that showed concentrationsexceeding OSHA's proposed limits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Only those substances for which OSHA is proposing to reduce an existing8-hour TWA limit or to add a new 8-hour TWA limit were included in theanalysis. A total of approximately 37,500 personal air sample results forabout 160 substances were appropriate for use in this analysis. This analysisdoes not estimate the benefits associated with reducing current ceilinglimits or adding new short-term exposure limits (STELs) because the dataobtained from the IMIS did not include information on sample duration forceiling or peak measurements, or OSHA was not able to relate the IMIS dataon ceiling or peak measurements to the proposed short-term or ceiling limits.In addition to the IMIS exposure data, OSHA has completed a telephone interviewsurvey of over 5,300 workplaces that are potentially affected by the revisionof OSHA's Z Tables. Data from this survey provide information on substancesthat are used in a variety of industrial processes at the facilities surveyed,the number of workers involved in these processes, and whether personalexposure measurements taken at the processes exceeded OSHA, ACGIH, or NIOSHlimits.Employment data by four-digit SIC code were obtained from three data sources.For each four-digit SIC represented in the IMIS file, OSHA first reliedon 1985 data from the BLS LABSTAT data base [1]. Where data were unavailablefor this source at the four-digit SIC level, OSHA relied on Dun andamp; Bradstreet's<T3>Market Identifiers </T3>file for 1985 [2]. Data from 1985 <T3>County Business Patterns </T3>[3] were used to obtain employment datafor four-digit SIC groups not represented in either the LABSTAT or Dunandamp; Bradstreet file.Data on illness and lost workday rates were obtained from the 1985 LABSTATfile for all industries (at the three- and four-digit level) representedin the IMIS file. These data included rates per 100 employees for totalillness cases, lost-workday illness cases, and total number of lost workdays.Estimates of the Number of Potentially Exposed EmployeesEstimates of the number of employees potentially exposed to the substancesincluded in this analysis were derived from the IMIS data, OSHA's surveydata, and employment data bases. To conduct the analysis, OSHA used theIMIS and survey data separately to derive independent estimates of thenumber of workers potentially exposed and the number of workers exposedabove the proposed limits for each substance. The estimates derived fromthese two data sources were then combined to yield an overall assessmentof the extent of employee exposure, by four-digit SIC, to substances includedin this rulemaking. The following sections describe how each of the databases was used to develop estimates of employee exposures, and how theseestimates were then combined.Estimates Derived From OSHA's IMIS Data BaseFor each facility inspected, the IMIS contained information on the numberof employees at the facility and the number of employees observed to bepotentially exposed to each substance for which personal air samples werecollected. For each substance sampled within an industry (at the four-digitlevel), the estimated number of employees potentially exposed to that substancein the industry was determined by the following formula:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus 1112</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P<T2>f</T2> = number of employees observed to be potentially exposed tothe substance at a facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">E<T2>f</T2> = total number of employees at the facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">W = number of production workers in the industry in 1985; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P = estimated number of employees potentially exposed to the substancein the industry.</ITAG>The estimated number of workers currently exposed above the proposed limitsfor each substance was calculated using the following formula:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus 1112B</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">S<T2>f</T2> = number of samples that exceeded the proposed limit for thesubstance at all facilities in an industry sector;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">T<T2>f</T2> = total number of personal samples taken for the substance atall facilities in the industry sector.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P = estimated number of employees potentially exposed to the substancein the industry; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Z = estimated number of workers in an industry sector currently exposedabove the proposed limits for the substance.</ITAG>Estimates Derived From OSHA's Survey DataFacilities participating in OSHA's telephone survey provided the followinginformation that was useful for estimating the extent of employee exposureto chemical substances:andbullet; The facility's four-digit SIC code;andbullet; The total number of production employees at the facility;andbullet; The number of employees involved in each process used at the facility;andbullet; The substances used or present in each process;andbullet; The exposure limits used as internal targets or goals at the facility(i.e., OSHA's current limits, ACGIH limits, NIOSH limits, or ``Other''limits such as those from material safety data sheets or insurance carriers);andandbullet; Whether employee exposures exceeded the targeted limits for eachprocess/chemical combination present at the facility.To estimate the number of employees potentially exposed to a given substancein a 4-digit SIC industry group, OSHA assumed that all employees who areinvolved with processes in which the substance was used or present arepotentially exposed. Thus, the formula for estimating the number of employeeswho are potentially exposed to a substance in a given industry sector is<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus 1113A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">X<T2>f</T2> = number of employees at the facility who are involved in processesusing a given substance;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">T<T2>f</T2> = total production workforce at the facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">W = the number of production workers in the industry sector in 1985;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P = estimated number of employees potentially exposed to the substancein the industry sector.</ITAG>To estimate the number of employees currently exposed above the proposedlimits, OSHA relied on survey responses that indicated whether exposuremeasurements associated with a process exceeded the facility's internalexposure limits. If a facility responded that exposure measurements takenat a process area did not exceed ACGIH, NIOSH, or some ``other'' set oflimits, OSHA assumed that no potentially exposed employee is currentlyexposed above the proposed limit for any substance associated with theprocess. On the other hand, if a facility responded that exposure measurementstaken at a process did not exceed current OSHA, ACGIH, or ``Other'' setof limits, OSHA assumed that all potentially exposed employees are currentlyexposed above the proposed limits for all substances associated with theprocess. In addition, if the process had certain characteristics that suggestedthat the proposed limits were not being achieved (i.e., lack of ventilationsystem or open process used indoors) all employees involved in the processwere assumed to be overexposed. The decision logic for determining whenemployees at a particular process may be overexposed was the same as thatused for estimating costs associated with achieving the proposed limits(see Chapter VI, Costs of Compliance).Approach for Combining Estimates Derived From the IMIS Data and SurveyDataTo obtain an overall estimate of the extent of employee exposures to substancesused in each four-digit SIC industry group, OSHA combined the estimatesderived separately from the IMIS and survey data. Table III-1 illustrateshow these estimates were combined to yield an overall estimate of the extentof employee exposures in SIC 2851. Where estimates for a given substancecould be derived from one data set but not the other, the combined assessmentuses the available estimates without adjustment. Where estimates couldbe derived from both data sets for the same substance, the combined assessmentis based on the average of the available estimates; this approach has theeffect of giving equal weight to estimates derived from either the IMISor survey data.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 1115-1116</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Estimates of the number of employees potentially exposed and the numberexposed above the proposed limits are available in Supplement #2, #3, #4,#5, and #6 to this regulatory analysis. In addition to exposure estimatethese Supplements also contain process and industry use information bysubstance. (Copies of these Supplements are available, upon request, fromthe office of Regulatory Analysis, Room N3627, OSHA.)Aggregate estimates of the number of employees potentially exposed or exposedabove the proposed limits to any substance considered in the analysis arepresented by two-digit SIC code in Table III-2. Because an employee maybe exposed to more than one substance in a given industry, aggregate estimatesof the size of the exposed population are presented as minimum and maximumestimates. Maximum estimates of the size of the exposed population assumethat no employee is exposed to more than one substance; minimum estimatesassume the greatest possible extent of multiple chemical exposure. Forexample, if 200 employees are estimated to be exposed to acetone and 300employees are estimated to be exposed to toluene in a given industry, aminimum of 300 employees is estimated to be exposed to either substancein the industry, and a maximum of 500 employees is estimated to be exposedto either substance in the industry. Employees exposed above the proposed limits are considered to be ``at risk''of adverse health effects. It should be noted that this presentation showsrisk reduction in employee equivalent terms; while all (100 percent) ofthe workers currently exposed above the new proposed limits would benefitfrom reduced risk, the new lower limits would not eliminate all chemicalexposure risk. An estimated five, ten, or twenty percent residual riskequivalent would remain at the new lower limits. Although not quantified,all employees currently exposed to hazardous substances at or below therecommended new levels would experience this residual risk. To obtain anapproximation of risk reduction at the lower exposure levels being proposed,OSHA estimated that 95, 80, or 90 percent of the workers currently exposedabove the proposed limits (i.e., the midpoint between the minimum and maximumestimates) will benefit from reduced risk after their exposures are loweredto or below the proposed limits. The results of this analysis are alsopresented by two-digit SIC codes in Table III-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1118-1119</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Estimates of the Reduction in Illness Cases and Lost Workdays The BLS LABSTAT data base contains illness and lost workdays rates by SICcode. These rates are expressed as the annual number of illness cases ornumber of lost workdays per 100 full-time-equivalent employees. Reducingemployee exposures to hazardous substances to a level below that associatedwith adverse health effects will result in a decrease in the number ofillness cases and lost workdays. To assess the impact on illness and lost workday rates of reducing employeeexposures, OSHA first examined the relationship between the percentageof workers estimated to be exposed above the proposed exposure limits forthe 160 substances included in the study and current illness and lost workdayrates. This analysis was conducted at the three-digit SIC code level becauseof the lack of illness rate data for some of the four-digit SIC code groups.The results of this analysis are presented graphically in Figure III-1.Among three-digit industries for which OSHA has found that no employeesare currently exposed above the proposed limits, total illness case ratesreported by the BLS for the same industry group are usually less than 0.2cases per 100 employees per year, and frequently are reported to be zero.In contrast, where OSHA has found that industry groups have more than 2percent of their workforce exposed above the proposed limits, total illnesscase rates above 0.2 cases per 100 employees are frequently reported. Inno instance does an industry group having 10 percent or more of its workforceexposed above the proposed limits report a total illness case rate of zero.Among three-digit SIC code industry groups for which OSHA has not foundemployee exposures above the proposed limit, 37 percent of the groups reportedan illness rate of zero, 45 percent reported an illness rate of 0.1 to0.2 cases per 100 employees, and only 18 percent of the industry groupsreported an illness rate greater than 0.2 cases per 100 employees (butnone above 0.5 cases per 100 employees). Given this distribution of illnessrates across these particular industry groups, it is concluded that industrygroups in which employee exposures have been controlled to or below theproposed limits will have an illness rate approximating 0.1 cases per 100employees. It is believed that total illness cases at the three-digit levelwill be reduced to no more than 0.1 cases per 100 employees after employeeexposures are reduced to or below the proposed limits.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1122</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>OSHA performed a similar analysis that also indicates that the rate oflost-workday illness cases will decline to a base rate of 0.05 cases per100 employee and the annual rate of lost workdays will decline to 1 per100 employees after employees exposures are reduced to or below the proposedlimits.OSHA estimated the number of illness cases and lost workdays potentiallyavoided annually by applying current illness rates to the estimated numberof production workers per three-digit SIC group; this yielded an estimateof the annual number of illness cases and lost workdays reported by eachthree-digit SIC code industry group. It was assumed that, after promulgationof the proposed limits, these industries would experience illness ratesof 0.1 cases per 100 employees, 0.05 lost-workday illness cases per 100employees, and 1 lost workday per 100 employees per year. Using this approach,OSHA estimated that promulgation of the proposed limits will potentiallyavoid 55,216 illness cases per year, 23,608 lost workday illness casesper year, and 533,197 lost workdays caused by illnesses per year.The movement to a 0.1 illness rate is presented as a best estimate supportedby OSHA's interpretation of the relationship between chemical exposurelevels and current industry illness rates. It may be argued, however, thatif a 0.1 illness rate were achieved, the reduction in illnesses could notbe credited exclusively to OSHA's rulemaking initiative, since some portionof the current BLS illness rate is made up of illnesses associated withexposures to hazardous agents or physical stress (e.g., radiation, noise,ergonomic stress).While no claim is made that this rulemaking action will reduce illnessesrelated to these causes, OSHA believes that the benefit estimates relatedto this proposal of over 55,000 illnesses, over 23,600 lost workday illnesses,and over 533,000 lost workdays avoided each year are reasonable. This isbased on the belief that company records, upon which the BLS data are based,rarely show chronic illnesses caused by exposures to toxic substances [4,6]. The potential level of underreported illnesses in the BLS series isillustrated in a recent report by Landrigan and Markowitz. Using Californiaphysicians' reports of occupational illnesses, these authors estimatedan occupational illness rate among New York State employees that was morethan twice the BLS illness rate [8].Estimates of the Number of Employees Potentially at Risk by Type of HazardIn addition to estimating the number of employees exposed to the substancesincluded in this analysis, OSHA also estimated the number of employeeswho are at risk of experiencing particular types of adverse health effects.To conduct this analysis, each substance included in the rulemaking wasassigned to a health hazard category; these assignments were based on theprimary health effects that provided the impetus for reducing an existinglimit or proposing a new limit for a particular substance. (The assignmentof substances to health effect categories is described in detail in SectionIV-C of the preamble.) It should be noted that, in some instances, substancesincluded in this rulemaking were grouped together in the preamble accordingto some basis other than a particular health effect; for example, severalsubstances were grouped together because the ACGIH-recommended limits werederived based on the structural analogy of the grouped substances withthat of other substances. For the benefits analysis described here, thesesubstances were re-classified according to the primary health effect associatedwith exposure to the analogous chemical.The number of employees estimated to be exposed to substances causing aparticular health effect in an industry group was calculated by summingthe number of employees exposed to all substances causing the same effect.Aggregate estimates across all affected industry sectors are presentedin Table III-3. This table provides estimates of employees potentiallyexposed to substances in each health group, as well as estimates of employeesexposed above the proposed limits for substances in each health group.Employees are frequently at risk from a variety of adverse health effectsas a result of concurrent exposure to more than one toxic substance. Thus,the total number of employees considered to be at risk from any type ofillness (as estimated in Table III-3) cannot be summed because the sumwould result in doublecounting.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1126</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Estimates of the Number of Illness-Related Fatalities AvoidedAs discussed in the preceding section, OSHA has estimated the number ofemployees currently at risk of experiencing a variety of adverse healtheffects brought about by over-exposures to the substances included in thisrulemaking. Many of these adverse effects result in lethal outcomes, inparticular cancer, cardiovascular effects, chronic respiratory disease,and chronic liver and kidney damage. OSHA also believes that employeeswho are excessively exposed to substances causing systemic organ damage,neurological impairment, or metabolic effects (i.e., cardiovascular diseasethrough excessive formation of methemoglobin or carboxyhemoglobin, andneurological impairment through cholinesterase inhibition) are at excessrisk of incurring a fatal condition.To estimate the number of fatalities associated with excessive exposureto the 160 substances included in this analysis, OSHA relied on standardU.S. mortality rates and on published estimates of the proportion of fatalitiesthat are believed to be associated with occupational illnesses. These dataallowed OSHA to calculate cause-specific mortality rates that are attributableto occupational illnesses (i.e., mortality rates that represent the excessrisk of mortality from occupational disease). OSHA then applied these occupationally-relatedmortality rates to its estimates of the number of employees exposed tothe 160 substances of concern at levels above the proposed limits. OSHA'smethodology and estimates are presented in Table III-4, and are describedin detail below.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus 2 1127</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a Source: National Center for Health Statistics [5, Table II].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b Based on a total residential population in 1985 of 238,740,000.[7, p. 18].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c Assumes 10 percent of all cancer deaths are of occupational origin(Landrigan and Markowitz, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d Assumes 5 percent of all cancer deaths are of occupational origin(Landrigan and Markowitz, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e Assumes 3 percent of all deaths are of occupational origin (Landriganand Markowitz, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f Assumes 1 percent of all deaths are of occupational origin (Landriganand Markowitz, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g From Table III-3, midpoint estimate of number of workers exposedabove proposed limits for potential carcinogens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">h From Table III-3, midpoint estimate of number of workers exposedabove proposed limits for respiratory toxins.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i From Table III-3, midpoint estimate of number of workers exposedabove proposed limits for liver toxins.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">j From Table III-3, midpoint estimate of number of workers exposedabove proposed limits for systemic toxins, metabolic toxins, cardiovasculartoxins, and neuropathic agents.</ITAG>Estimate of the Number of Cancer FatalitiesThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics has published cause-specificU.S. mortality rates for 1985 (the most recent data available) [5]. Thissource reported that the annual U.S. cancer death rate in 1985 was 193.3per 100,000 residents. Based on a total resident U.S. population of 238,740,000in 1985 [7, p. 18], the number of cancer deaths that occurred in 1985 was461,484. Landrigan and Markowitz [8] reviewed several published estimatesof the percentage of cancer deaths that are attributable to occupationally-relateddisease. These estimates range from less than 5 percent to 33 percent ofall cancer deaths. Landrigan and Markowitz believe that, as a best estimate,10 percent of all cancer deaths have an occupational origin.Using an occupational cancer death estimate of 10 percent and applyingit to the estimated number of cancer deaths in 1985, OSHA estimates that46,148 occupationally-related cancer deaths occurred in the United Statesin that year. Table III-4 also shows an alternative assessment of occupationally-inducedmortality that is based on an assumption that only 5 percent of all cancerdeaths are of occupational origin.As the next step, OSHA estimated the overall cancer death rate among thepopulation which is occupationally exposed to chemicals and the remainderof the population. In 1985, there were an average of 108,856,000 personsemployed [9, p. 8]. However, 25,469,200 of these were employed in industriesor occupations where there is a low risk of exposure to toxic substances,such as finance, insurance, real estate, and private households [9, pp.30, 84-88]. The remaining 83,386,800 persons are considered to be occupationallyexposed to chemicals in varying degrees. Many would have only intermittentexposure at very low levels. Using the two alternative assumptions of thepercentage of all cancer deaths which are of occupational origin (10 percentand 5 percent), OSHA calculated the annual cancer death rate attributedto occupational exposure by dividing the number of cancer deaths attributableto occupational illness by the population exposed, and multiplying by 100,000.If the 10 percent assumption is used, OSHA estimates that the annual cancermortality rate attributable to occupational exposure to toxic substancesis 55.3 per 100,000; with the 5 percent assumption, the rate would be 27.7.OSHA then estimated that there are 499,716 workers currently exposed abovethe proposed limits to the potential carcinogens included in this rulemaking.Applying the work-related cancer death rates to this population, OSHA estimatesthat between 138 and 276 cancer fatalities occur each year among theseworkers and that these fatalities will be prevented by the proposed rule.In arriving at this estimate, two important offsetting arguments were considered.Because some of these workers may also be exposed to occupational carcinogensthat are not covered in this rulemaking (such as asbestos or benzene),the number of occupational cancer deaths attributed to the substances includedin this rulemaking may be overestimated. Offsetting this potential overestimateis the fact that the excess mortality rates of 27.7-55.3 per 100,000 workerswere developed on the basis of occupational exposures among all exposedworkers. However, the excess mortality rate experienced among workers withhigh average exposures to hazardous chemicals typically runs at least twoor three times higher than the national average rate. In considerationof this, OSHA believes that any overestimate of cancer fatalities avoidedattributed to regulated chemicals not covered under this rulemaking isoffset by the use of a mortality rate which understates the true excessmortality rate among workers with very high exposures to toxic chemicals.(Additional comments on excess mortality rate estimates are included inthe final section of this chapter.)An alternative analysis of the reduction in cancer mortality was conductedusing OSHA's quantitative risk assessments for the potential human carcinogensincluded in this rulemaking (the results of OSHA's risk assessments arepresented in the preamble to the proposal). This analysis is presentedin table III-5. Using the combined IMIS and survey data, OSHA found thatemployees are currently exposed above the proposed limits to four of thesepotential carcinogens (acrylamide, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, andstyrene). Applying OSHA's risk estimates to the estimated number of workerscurrently overexposed to thse substances, OSHA estimates that compliancewith the proposed limits will avoid 5,005 cancer fatalities over the workinglifetime of the population (i.e., 45 years). The average annual reductionin the number of cancer fatalities avoided over 45 years is estimated tobe 111.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1132</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Although OSHA has evaluated the cancer risk for 17 potential carcinogens,there were IMIS and survey data for only four of these. Lack of IMIS orsurvey data means that the substance has not been sampled by an OSHA complianceofficer or that none of the survey participants indicated that the substancewas used at their facilities. This does not mean that no workers are currentlyexposed to these substances. Lacking a basis for estimating the extentof employee exposure, OSHA could not estimate the extent of reduction incancer deaths attributable to the proposed reduction in exposure limitsfor these substances. To the extent that employee exposure to these carcinogensis reduced, further reductions in the number of cancer deaths will occur.Estimated Reduction in Occupational Deaths From Causes Other Than CancerAs shown in Table III-4, OSHA also estimated the number of occupationally-relatedfatalities that are expected to occur annually among employees exposedto substances associated with adverse health effects other than cancer.To perform this analysis, OSHA relied on an estimate made by Landriganand Markowitz [7] that between 1 and 3 percent of all non-malignant diseaseis of occupational origin. Using the 1 and 3 percent figures as alternativeassumptions and using the same methodology as that described above forcancer deaths, Table III-4 shows the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Between 4 and 17 deaths caused by respiratory disease are estimatedto occur each year among workers exposed to respiratory toxins coveredin this rulemaking;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Between 1 and 4 deaths are estimated to occur each year among workersexposed to liver toxins covered in this rulemaking;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Between 150 and 449 deaths are estimated to occur each year amongworkers exposed to systemic toxins, cardiovascular toxins, metabolic toxins,and neurological toxins covered in this rulemaking.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Summing these estimates, OSHA believes that between 155 and 470 non-cancer-relatedoccupational fatalities occur each year. The same offsetting considerationsdiscussed in the analysis of the cancer fatalities avoided under this rule,also apply here. While some substances are being controlled by activityoutside of this rulemaking, any overestimate effect is balanced by an underestimateof the real excess mortality rate for workers with high exposure levelsto the chemicals under consideration.In sum, the combined estimate for the number of cancer and non-cancer deathspotentially avoided each year by compliance with the proposed new limits,is between 293 and 746 or an average of 519 fatalities avoided each year.Additional Comments and an Alternative Method for Estimating Excess MortalityRatesThe analysis described above to estimate the number of fatalities thatare potentially preventable relies on published estimates of the proportionof all U.S. fatalities that are believed to result from occupational illnesses.These estimates were used with U.S. cause-specific mortality rate figuresto estimate the excess mortality rate among all U.S. workers, by causeof death (shown in Table III-4).In making these excess mortality rate estimates, OSHA applied the excessnumber of fatalities across the U.S. working population occupationallyexposed to chemicals. Implicit in this approach is an assumption that allworkers are at some risk of fatality from all causes of death. In fact,only a portion of the workforce are at risk of fatality from each typeof occupational illness. Deaths will occur only among workers who are potentiallyexposed to carcinogens; no excess deaths will occur among workers who arenot so exposed. Similarly, not all workers are at risk of dying from occupationally-relatedcardiovascular illnesses; only some portion of the workforce are at excessrisk and all fatalities resulting from occupationally-related cardiovasculardisease will occur among this subset of workers. Because OSHA's excessmortality rate estimates presented earlier were derived by applying theestimated number of work-related fatalities across the exposed U.S. workforce,excess mortality rate figures are likely to be substantially understated.To assess the magnitude of this bias, OSHA conducted an alternative analysisto estimate the number of work-related fatalities that are expected tooccur among workers exposed above the proposed limits. This alternativeassessment relied on judgments regarding the general increase in mortalityrates that are frequently observed in epidemiologic studies that demonstratea causal relationship between exposure to toxic substances and excess diseasemortality. The alternative assessment is presented in Table III-6.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1136</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>The overall U.S. cancer mortality rate for 1985 is 193.3 deaths per 100,000residents (Table III-6). Typically, when causal relationships between exposureand excess lung cancer mortality are found in epidemiologic investigations,the exposed cohort frequently shows a cancer mortality rate of 1.1 to 10times higher than the general population. For cancers that are more rarethan lung cancer, mortality rates among working populations may be 50 timeshigher than for the general population. An alternative estimate of thenumber of cancer fatalities expected to occur among the estimated 499,716workers exposed above the proposed limits for the potential carcinogenscould be developed based on the assumption that the overall cancer fatalityrate among these workers is twice that of the U.S. population (i.e., 386.6per 100,000 workers vs. 193.3 per 100,000 residents). The <T3>excess</T3> cancer mortality rate among these workers is thereforeassumed to be 193.3 per 100,000 workers (386.6-193.3). Applying this estimatedexcess cancer mortality rate to the 499,716 workers exposed above the proposedlimits yields as estimated 966 cancer deaths occurring annually that areattributable to occupational exposure. This same approach could be usedfor estimating non-cancer-related fatalities assuming that the overallfatality rate among workers at risk from these illnesses is 1.3 times thecorresponding U.S. mortality rate (mortality rates of 1.1 to 1.5 are frequentlyobserved in epidemiologic studies demonstrating causal relationships betweenexposure and excess fatalities). This amounts to an <T3>excess</T3> mortality rate of 30 percent above the overall U.S. rate.  Applying these excess mortality rate figures to the estimated worker populationsexposed above the proposed limits, OSHA estimates that, among these workers,61 deaths occur annually due to chronic pulmonary disease, 13 deaths occurannually due to liver disease, and 1,571 deaths occur annually due to cardiovascular,neurological, and renal disease. In total, including cancer, OSHA estimatesthat 2,611 work-related fatalities may be occurring each year among employeeswho are exposed above the proposed limits for substances included in thisrulemaking.  <ITAG tagnum="74">References  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Assessment of Nonregulatory Alternatives  </ITAG>Introduction  The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of1970 is ``* * * to assure so far as possible every working man and womanin the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve ourhuman resources * * *.'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor,when promulgating occupational safety and health standards for toxic materialsor harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``* * * that most adequatelyassures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence,that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functionalcapacity * * *.'' It is on the basis of this congressional directive thatOSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effectsassociated with occupational exposure to hazardous substances.  Market Failure  Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatlyreduced where private markets work efficiently and effectively to allocatehealth and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitivelabor markets where workers, having perfect knowledge of job risks andbeing perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage premiums that fully compensatefor any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupationalinjury and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for thehazardous workplace conditions and, ultimately, by the consumers who payhigher prices for the final goods and services produced by these firms.With all costs internalized, private employers have an incentive to reducehazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the cost ofthe expected injury or illness. The resultant level of safety and healthis considered ``efficient'' in the sense that it minimizes the sum of thecosts of hazard prevention and of injury or illness. Perfectly competitivelabor markets, however, do not exist for many industrial markets. OSHA,therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions to provide greaterhealth protection for workers exposed to toxic substances.  Evidence indicates that market forces have not been effective in reducingexcessive occupational exposure to hazardous substances, thereby contributingto the consequent development of occupational diseases. In spite of thedanger associated with the inhalation or other exposure to hazardous substances,the social costs of production have not been internalized, in part, becauseof market imperfections and the existence of externalities. Consequently,the amount of protection that the private market will offer to workersdiffers from the socially desired level.  First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests thatin the absence of immediate or clear-cut danger, employees and employershave little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-termeffects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatorypayments may, in fact, have a disincentive to provide information to employees.When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employeesmight still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially wherelong latency periods precede the development of chronic disabling disease.Morever, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness couldbe job-related or could have other causes_employees and employers may notlink disease with such occupational exposure.  Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associatedwith exposure to hazardous substances, many face limited employment options.Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemploymentrates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employmentquickly or easily. A worker employed in a foundry, for example, could findit difficult to apply occupational skills to a new job in searching fora safer workplace.  In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is notbetween a safe job and a better paying but more hazardous position, butsimply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of payand risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolongedperiods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance tobreak family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factorssuch as pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost ofjob transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demandsof more mobile workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware ofjob risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not fully compensate.Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflectaccurately the value that workers place on health.In addition to the market imperfections, externalities occur if employersand employees settle for an inefficiently low level of protection fromhazardous substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently,only workers and their employers should be affected by the level of safetyand health provided in market transactions. In the case of occupationalsafety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burdenof occupationally induced diseases, including the costs of premature death,chronic illness, and disability. Those individuals who suffer from occupationallyrelated illness are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayersupport of social programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare.These combined factors of labor market imperfections and the existenceof externalities contribute to the failure of the market to supply healthfulworking conditions in industries where hazardous substances exist.Tort LiabilityThe use of liability under tort law is one nonregulatory alternative thathas been increasingly used in litigation concerning occupationally relatedillnesses. Prosser [1] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong, otherthan a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy inthe form of an action for damages,'' although he says that ``a really satisfactorydefinition has yet to be found.''If the tort system applies, it would allow a worker whose health has beenadversely affected by occupational exposure to a hazardous substance tosue and recover damages from the employer. Thus, if the tort system iseffectively applied, it might shift the liability of direct costs of occupationaldisease from the worker to the firm under certain specific circumstances.With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viablealternative in dealings between employees and their employers. All stateshave legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusiveor principal remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus,under tort law, workers with an occupational disease caused by exposureto a hazardous substance can only file a product liability suit againsta third party manufacturer (e.g., Johns Manville), processor, distributor,sales firm, installer, agency, or contractor. It is often difficult, however,to demonstrate a direct link between an exposure to a hazardous substanceand the illness.In order to pursue litigation successfully, there must be specific knowledgeof the magnitude and duration of a worker's exposure to a hazardous substance,as well as the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure.Usually, it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupationalexposures in causing the disease, especially if workers are exposed tomany toxic substances. This difficulty is further compounded by the longlatency periods that are frequently involved. In addition, the liable partymust be identifiable, but workers may have several employers over a workinglifetime. The burden of proof that an occupational exposure to a hazardoussubstance occurred, that a specific employer is the liable party, and thatthe exposure level was significant may prohibit the individual from initiatingthe suit.The costs associated with producing information and with litigation itselfmay be quite substantial. First, information is a public good, which meansthat once produced it can be transmitted inexpensively to any number ofindividuals without diminishing the quality or quantity of the information.It is, therefore, difficult to control distribution once the informationis produced. A producer of information may find that information producedat great expense can be acquired freely by potential customers, and thatconsequently, the market for the information has virtually disappeared.As a result, public goods are typically underproduced relative to whatis considered economically efficient. This general undersupply of informationadversely affects the workers' awareness of the cause of their illnessand thus reduces the likelihood that they will pursue tort liability suits.Second, legal proceedings impose costs on both plaintiffs and defendants.In deciding whether to sue, the tort victim must be sure that the sizeof the claim will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, theplaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction costs in the form ofa contingency fee, commonly 33 percent, plus additional legal expenses.The accused firm must also pay for its defense.The majority of occupational disease tort activity has involved workersexposed to asbestos. To date, about 25,000 individual plaintiffs have filedasbestos lawsuits in the country. These employees avoided the exclusiveremedy of Workers' Compensation by suing suppliers of asbestos insteadof employers. A report prepared by the Research Triangle Institute entitled,<T3>Tort Liability and Worker Health: An Examination of the Economic, Legal,and Scientific Issues Surrounding the Occupational Disease Protection Affordedby Tort Law </T3>[2], contains some data pertaining to legal costs andthe size of awards. One investigator, for example, found that an averageratio of legal costs to proceeds was 37 percent for a sample of cases.The data, however, do not separate legal fees paid by the defendants andplaintiffs.Insurance and liability costs are not borne in full by the specific employerresponsible for the risk involved. For firms that are insured, the premiumdetermination process is such that premiums only partially reflect changesin risk associated with changes in exposure to hazardous substances. Thislack of complete adjustment is the so-called ``moral hazard problem,''which is the risk that arises from the possible dishonesty or imprudenceof the insured. As the insured firm has paid an insurance company to assumesome of the risks, that firm has less reason to exercise the diligencenecessary to avoid losses. Transfer of risk is a fundamental source ofimperfection in markets.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For a general discussion of moral hazard as a source ofmarket failure, see Arrow [4] and Spence and Zeckhauser [5]. For applicationsof this concept to employee health and safety, see Chelius [6], Rea [7],and Consad and General Research Corporation [8, Section 5.1].For firms that self-insure or carry liability insurance with a large deductible,the costs of a single claim may be fully borne by the firm. Very smallfirms, and large firms with a large number of claims, however, may failto meet the full costs by declaring bankruptcy. For example, the JohnsManville Corporation \2\<NOTE/> declared bankruptcy to avoid massive claims associated withasbestos-related disease. Although the firm experienced a sharp declinein the value of its stock, it is still in business, while its obligationto pay asbestos-related claims is in considerable doubt. Other asbestosproducers including U.N.R. Industries, Inc. and Amatex Corporation havefollowed the example of the Manville Corporation by filing for bankruptcy[9], further reducing the chances that their workers or others who contractasbestos-related diseases will collect Workers' Compensation or tort liabilityawards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Johns Manville Corporation, formerly the world's largestasbestos manufacturer, filed for Chapter XI protection under the FederalBankruptcy Law in August 1982. The company was financially solvent whenit filed for bankruptcy but estimated that it would ultimately face a costof more than $2 billion to settle 52,000 asbestos-related claims. In themeantime, the company's assets have been frozen and successful plaintiffscannot collect awards [9].Workers' CompensationThe Workers' Compensation system is a result of the perceived inadequaciesin liability or insurance systems to compel employers to prevent occupationaldisease or compensate workers fully for their losses. The system was designedto internalize some of the social costs of production, but in reality,it has fallen short of compensating workers adequately for occupationallyrelated disease. Thus, society shares the burden of occupationally relatedadverse health effects, premature mortality, excess morbidity, and disabilitythrough taxpayer support of social programs such as welfare, Social Securitydisability payments, and Medicare.Compensation tends to be inadequate, especially in permanent disabilitycases, in view of the expiration of benefit entitlements and the failureto adjust benefits for changes in a worker's expected earnings over time.As of January 1987, 8 states still restricted permanent disability benefitseither by specifying a maximum number of weeks for which benefits couldbe paid or by imposing a ceiling on dollar payments [10].At present, time and dollar restrictions on benefit payments are even moreprevalent in the area of survivor benefits. The duration of survivor benefitsis often restricted to 10 years, and dollar maximums on survivor paymentsrange from $7,000 to $60,000. In addition, it should be noted that if theemployee dies quickly from the occupational illness and has no dependents,the employer need pay only nominal damages under Workers' Compensation(i.e., a $1,000 death benefit).Finally, in spite of current statutory protection, disability from occupationaldiseases represents a continuing, complex problem for Workers' Compensationprograms. Occupational diseases may take years to develop, and more thanone causal agent may be involved in their onset. Consequently, disabilitiesresulting from occupationally induced illness often are less clearly definedthan those from occupationally induced injury. As a result, Workers' Compensationis often a weak remedy in the case of occupational disease. For example,as recently as April 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an occupationaldisease case <T3>(Richard D. Bunker</T3> v.<T3> National Gypsum Co.)</T3> involving a worker who was diagnosed ashaving asbestosis 23 years after the expiration of the 3-year time limitallowed by Indiana law for filing a compensation claim [11]. Indeed, thereis some evidence indicating that the great majority of occupationally inducedillnesses are never reported or compensated [12].The insurance premiums paid by a firm under the Workers' Compensation systemare generally not experience rated_that is, they do not reflect the individualfirm's job safety and health record. About 80 percent of all firms areineligible for experience rating because of their small size. Such firmsare class rated, and rate reductions are granted only if the experienceof the entire class improves. Even when firms have an experience rating,the premiums paid may not accurately reflect the true economic losses.Segregation of loss experience into classes is somewhat arbitrary, andan individual firm may be classified with other firms that have substantiallydifferent normal accident rates. An experience rating is generally basedon the benefits paid to workers, not on the firm's safety record. Thus,employers may have a greater incentive to reduce premiums by contestingclaims than by initiating safety measures.In summary, the Workers' Compensation system suffers from several defectsthat seriously reduce its effectiveness in providing incentives for firmsto create safe and healthful workplaces. The scheduled benefits are significantlyless than the actual losses to the injured workers, and recovery is oftenvery difficult in the case of occupational diseases. Thus, the existenceof a Workers' Compensation system limits an employer's liability significantlybelow the actual costs of the injury. In addition, premiums for individualfirms are unlikely to be specifically related to that firm's risk environment.The firm, therefore, does not receive the proper ``signals'' and consequentlyfails to invest sufficient resources in reducing workplace injuries andillnesses. The economic costs not borne by the employer are borne by theemployee or, as is often the case, by society through public insuranceand welfare programs.Standards of Other OrganizationsTraditionally, representatives of professional organizations have collectivelydeveloped voluntary guidelines to assist members in maintaining safe andhealthful working conditions for their employees. These guidelines arewidely disseminated among members of the organizations and, at times, havebeen adopted as guidelines by organizations beyond the initiating one aswell as by industry groups. In some cases they have become the <T3>de facto</T3> industry standard. Three professional organizations havedeveloped voluntary guidelines in the form of exposure limits for chemicalsubstances: The American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the AmericanIndustrial Hygiene Association (AIHA); and the American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH). ANSI has withdrawn its earlier hazardoussubstance standards and has stated it does not intend to publish any others.The AIHA has a rather limited list of recommended limits. However, theACGIH has published an extensive list of threshold limit values (TLVs)for many years. The ACGIH is recognized throughout the world for its members'expertise and contribution to industrial hygiene.In May 1971, OSHA adopted as Federal health standards the exposure limitsrecommended by ANSI and ACGIH for 425 chemicals. Since that time, advancesin scientific knowledge have demonstrated that those limits are not alwaysadequate to protect employee health. Consequently, the ACGIH, the professionalorganization which continues to develop TLVs, has changed its recommendationsyearly to reflect later information. However, adherence to the TLVs developedafter 1971 is purely voluntary. Except for imminent hazards, there is nosanction for failure to comply with the limits and many employers havenot adopted practices which would control employee exposure to these newlevels.In addition to professional organizations, international bodies such asthe European Economic Community, the International Labor Organization,and the World Health Organization have recommended exposure limits forsome hazardous substances. While these limits may not be as widely knownin the United States as those of U.S. professional organizations, theyare made available to the industrial hygiene community through professionaljournals and meetings. Within the U.S., the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) of the Department of Health and Human Serviceshas published recommended exposure limits (RELs) for a number of chemicals.These are publicized through NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletins and otherpublications which are widely disseminated.Although the ACGIH TLVs and the NIOSH RELs are widely recognized by healthprofessionals and employers alike, OSHA has found that some employers arenot complying voluntarily with the newer TLVs, the RELs, or the standardsof other bodies. Chapter III discussed OSHA's estimates of the extent ofexposures in excess of the TLVs, and the adverse health effects resultingfrom the exposure. OSHA believes that significant numbers of employeesare exposed to chemicals at levels exceeding those recommended by otherorganizations, and that OSHA cannot rely on employers to comply voluntarilywith the recommendations. Therefore, OSHA concluded that this nonregulatoryalternative is not generating the optimal level of occupational health.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Technological Feasibility</ITAG>Feasibility Determination This chapter presents a technological feasibility analysis of industry'sability to meet OSHA's proposed permissible exposure limits (PELs) fora wide range of occupational health hazards. These PELs would include limitson airborne concentrations of substances, and in some instances, directcontact of the skin with the substance. The control of workplace exposures to toxic chemicals involves combininga variety of standard techniques to solve a situation-specific problem.OSHA believes that existing engineering controls are available to reduceexposure levels to new proposed levels. Standard controls have been adaptedin numerous situations to solve situation-specific problems. In this chapter, a number of process situations where airborne exposureshave been controlled by the use of engineering controls are described.OSHA has found examples of successful engineering controls for each ofthe processes identified in the sample survey and presented in Supplement2.Types of Controls In general, three basic types of controls may be employed to reduce employeeexposures: andbullet; Engineering controls andbullet; Work practices and administrative reforms andbullet; Personal protective equipment Consistent with OSHA regulations and policy, this chapter examines thefeasibility of engineering controls and work practices to control employeeexposure, in preference to personal protective equipment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Engineering Controls </ITAG>Engineering controls involve the use of: Local exhaust ventilation; generalventilation; isolation of the worker and enclosure of the source of emissions;process modifications; equipment modifications; and substitution of non-hazardouschemicals. These methods may be used alone or in combinations of any twoor more controls depending upon the needs of a specific situation. Variationsin situations usually result from the type of process being used and thenumber of chemicals in the air. However, these controls are consideredstandard techniques which will effectively control these variables eitherby themselves, or coupled with changes in work practices.<ITAG tagnum="81">Ventilation </ITAG>Perhaps the most widely used technique for controlling chemical exposuresis the use of ventilation. General ventilation uses the movement of airwithin the general work space to displace or dilute the contaminant withfresh outside air. General ventilation is not typically the preferred controlmethod in most operations due to the large volumes of air movement required.Local exhaust ventilation uses much smaller volumes of air, exhausted fromthe point at which contaminants are generated to remove the contaminantat the source.<ITAG tagnum="81">Isolation </ITAG>Isolation involves placing a physical barrier between the hazardous operationand the worker. Many modern, automated manufacturing processes are nowfully enclosed in ventilated cabinets. The effectiveness of such a controltechnique depends on the frequency with which the workers have to enterthe enclosure during normal operations. In other situations, rather thanplacing the process or machine in an enclosure, the worker may be put intoa controlled atmosphere enclosure. Many processes which involve potentialchemical exposures are operated remotely by operators in air conditionedbooths.<ITAG tagnum="81">Substitution </ITAG>Substitution refers to the replacement of a toxic chemical in a particularprocess or work area with another, less toxic product. Properly applied,substitution can be a very effective control technique. However, care mustbe taken to ensure that the proposed substitution performs in a similarmanner to the product being replaced. In addition, it is essential thatthe substitute be carefully evaluated to ensure that in controlling onehazard, that another, different hazard is not inadvertently introduced.The substitute must also be compatible with existing manufacturing equipmentand processes. The success of these techniques will depend on the physical propertiesof the chemicals and emissions encountered (boiling point, vapor pressure,etc.) and the process operating conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.).In some cases, particularly with cleaning solvents, substitution may providethe quickest and most effective means of reducing exposure. In other situationswhere particular physical or chemical properties are required, major effortmay be required to alter processes or install or expand local or generaldilution ventilation. The extent to which engineering controls may be effectivelyused will vary from industry to industry, as well as plant to plant withinan industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">Work Practices and Administrative Reforms </ITAG>Work practice controls include housekeeping procedures, material handlingor transfer procedures, leak detection program, training and personal hygiene.In many cases, it is possible to bring about substantial reduction in employeeexposures by applying work practice controls.<ITAG tagnum="81">Personal Protective Equipment </ITAG>Where it is impractical to apply engineering or work practice controls,or where their application will not consistently reduce employee exposuresbelow the proposed PELs, personal protective equipment may be used to preventand reduce exposures.Industry Engineering ControlsTo determine whether engineering controls and work practices can reduceemployee exposures to the proposed PELs, OSHA, through its contractors,examined typical work processes found in a cross section of industries.Supplement 2 contains a list of processes identified in the nationwidesample survey of over 5,300 firms. Using this list, industry experts identifiedwhich major processes had potential hazardous exposures and may requireadditional engineering controls or different work practices in order toachieve the proposed PELs. To assess whether these would be feasible forthe processes within the industry group, records maintained by OSHA andNIOSH were searched to identify examples of the successful applicationof controls to these processes. Based upon the judgments of the industryexperts, a determination was made as to the probable feasibility of achievingthe proposed PELs.The following are examples of feasible methods of controlling exposureto hazardous substances encountered in processes used in the SICs for whichcosts and benefits have been identified. Unit costs for these similar controlswere used as the basis for the cost projections in Chapter V.SIC 20_Food and Kindred ProductsThe levels of ammonia gas encountered in poultry processing (SICs 2016and 2017) were controlled by the appropriate placement of cut-off valvesto freezer coils and by the use of an alarm detection system to monitorambient air conditions.In beet sugar refining (SIC 202), exposure to calcium oxide was controlledby replacing slide gates with rotary feeders. A milk products plant (SIC2023) controlled carbon dioxide exposures by using a hood which fully enclosedthe chiller-conveyor line and exhausted air from the system to an exteriorbaghouse.Carbon dioxide levels resulting from the use of dry ice were controlledat a meat packing plant (SICs 2011 and 2013) by a stainless steel exhausthood. Similarly, a poultry dressing plant controlled carbon dioxide emissionsby using a slotted blood exhaust ventilation system.A food processing plant (SIC 202) controlled carbon dioxide exposure byincreasing the number of air changes in the packaging room. SIC 21_Tobacco ProductsTobacco dust and residual pesticide dusts created during cutting and shreddingoperations are reduced through the use of local exhaust ventilation. Thisis also used to control emissions of ethyl alcohol-based chemical flavoringsduring blending operations.SIC 22_Textile Mill ProductsTextiles are dyed at various stages in their manufacture, including unspunfibers, unwoven yarn, and finished fabric. Workers who prepare fabricsfrom unspun fibers are of particular concern, since they could be potentiallyexposed to dyes contained on dusts generated during manufacture. In addition,some dyes possess much poorer fastness to wet treatment than do others;persons who launder such clothing are potentially exposed to dyes. Stringentcontrol measures and work practices can prevent such exposure.Several generally acceptable practices for the control of hazardous materialscan be used wherever there is potential for exposure. For example, pressurefailure alarms for closed systems and exhaust ventilation can rapidly indicatea system failure that might result in the release of substantial quantitiesof dyes. Continuous flow indicators, such as water or oil manometers properlymounted at the juncture of a fume hood and duct throat and marked to indicateacceptable airflow, will give a readily observable indication of decreasedefficiency in the ventilation system for the hood. Wet methods, vacuumcleaning, or other methods that do not lead to redispersion of settleddust should be used for plant maintenance and sanitation. Dry sweepingor blowing with compressed air should be prohibited.SIC 23_ApparelChemical exposures in the apparel industry occur principally as a resultof three exposure sources: Spot cleaning, dry cleaning and contact withtreated fabrics.Spot cleaning and dry cleaning operations can be controlled with the useof local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. Work practice improvementshelp reduce solvent exposure during transfer operations. Routine scheduledmaintenance is used to detect and control leaks from door gaskets and seals.Contact dermatitis is reduced through the use of disposable gloves andadherence to a personal hygiene program.SIC 24_Lumber and WoodThe primary worker exposure in the lumber and wood industry is wood dust.For the operation of large equipment (e.g. in debarking and sawmill activities),the operator can be placed in an enclosed control booth, or in the caseof moving equipment (e.g. cherry pickers, loaders and cranes), the operatorcan be located in an enclosed cab. In both cases, air would be filteredand conditioned. In the case of felting or matting process lines, or suchequipment as belt sanders, the equipment can be enclosed or hooded andvented to a baghouse. For smaller equipment, such as variety saws, tenoners,and dovetailers, hoods or various types of negative pressure (or combinationsof positive and negative pressure) local ventilation devices can be usedto control wood dust. In the case of hand-held sanders, a vacuum systemcan sometimes be applied to the process. Some other wood dust generatingequipment can also be enclosed (e.g. planers), but this is generally donefor noise control.SIC 25_FurnitureIn the metal office furniture manufacturing sector (SIC 2522), air contaminantsfrom the coating process have been controlled. Prefabricated sheet componentsfor file cabinets are prewashed and coated with polyester or acrylic ona high speed conveyor line. The application process includes manual sprayingof cabinets with airless atomizing sprayers and electrostatic spray gunson reciprocators. Manual spraying operations are performed in downdraftbooths. Filtered fresh air is supplied through the open top of the boothsand removed at the bottom through a water curtain by exhaust fans mountedon the roof of the booth. Spray headers in exhaust plenums clear paintmist from the air stream. Automatic spray booths contain electrostaticspray guns and side draft ventilation. Furthermore, organic solvent vaporsin the paint mixing and storage room are controlled by equipping each drumwith a heavy barrel cover, an integral adgitator, sealed pipe openings,and a closeable access line.SIC 26_Paper and Allied ProductsPulp mills occur primarily in SIC 2611, but can also be present as partof the operations in SICs 2621 and 2631. High control costs could potentiallybe incurred because of the large quantities of chemicals used in breakingdown pulp to form cellulose and the reactions that occur in the digestingprocess between these chemicals and the substances contained in the woodfiber. Large quantities of chemicals are also used in the bleaching operations.The digesting and bleaching operations are also very extensive. Large quantitiesof pulp are generally produced from wood in these mills either for captiveuse or for shipment to paper and paperboard mills. The type of controlsthat would be used include ventilation, enclosure and/or process change,but less likely the latter. Various engineering controls have been usedby the paper mill industry to prevent the mixing of toxic chemicals insewer lines. Tanks containing the hazardous chemicals have been isolatedand surrounded by dikes. Discharge lines have been re-routed to preventaccidental mixing.SIC 27_Printing and PublishingExposure to solvent vapors in the silk-screening sector of a printing plant(SIC 2751) was controlled by installing a new ventilation system and anexhaust fan.SIC 28_Chemicals and Allied ProductsThe plastic materials and resins manufacturing sector (SIC 2821) used atank with a hinged cover and fixed ductwork as an exhaust when dumpingdye and additives into hot methanol.Dust exposure during the bag opening operation in paint manufacturing (SIC2851) was controlled by modifying the hood to increase dust capture. Likewise,a new dust collection system (collection hoods) with increased capturevelocity was installed for use in the bagging and packaging of pesticides(SIC 287).Pharmaceutical manufacturers (SIC 2824) addressed the problem of nuisancedust particles by fitting vacuum crescents and elephant trunks on pointsources, by fitting chutes with covers, and by placing vacuum attachmentson receiving drum covers. Additionally, monitoring was performed from anoutside room.In order to reduce employee exposure to sulfur dioxide while producingsulfur dioxide gas (SIC 2819), sample collection units were enclosed andattached to a fume collection system. Sample waste was recycled to preventopen exposure in process areas. Electronic spent acid interface detectorswere installed to eliminate the need for employee visual inspection ofintermittently pulled samples. To control TDI exposure in urethane foammanufacturing (SIC 2822), the bun conveyor was enclosed and exhausted.Employee exposure was limited to the startup and finish procedures wheninstalling and removing bun support. A mechanism was designed to supportthe bun, which eliminated the need for it to be done manually.The production of paints (SIC 2851) is a batch procedure which involvesthe following steps: Prebatching, mixing, dispersing, tinting and shading,filling, and storage or shipping. When prebatching or mixing, an employeewill slit a bag of dry pigment with a knife and either scoop out the contentsfor weighing or dump the pigment into the mixer. In some cases, pigmentsare received in a slurry form and are piped directly into the mixer. Solventsand other raw materials are added into the mixer. Once combined, the mixtureis in a past or slurry form. This mixture is then thoroughly dispersedin a roller, ball, or sand mill or a high-speed disperser all of whichare generally closed processes. The paste is transferred to a storage tankwhere thinning or other agents are added. The paint is later drawn off,filtered and packaged in cans or drums. Airborne dust exposures to componentsin dry pigments occur during the prebatching and mixing operations whenthe bags of pigments are opened and dumped. Exposure to chemicals in drypigments can also occur from pigment spillage and empty bag flatteningand disposal. Once the batch is in solution in the mixer, there are nofurther dust emission points. Exposure to solvents can occur during additionof these ingredients to the mixing tanks, during any leaks or spills, andduring packaging.Local exhaust ventilation would be used to control exposures to dusts andfumes in the paint production processes. Pigment dust exposures at thedumping station can be controlled with the use of a vented enclosure keptunder negative pressure by a ventilation system. Empty bags would be manuallyejected through a side opening into a large plastic disposal bag to minimizedust generation during bag flattening and disposal.Exposures to solvents would be minimized with the use of portable hoodsattached to flexible ductwork. These ventilation hoods could be placedover the liquid dumping process and also the packaging operation if thepercentage and volatility of the solvents would result in exposures.SIC 29_Petroleum RefiningIn order to assure the quality of petroleum products and determine qualityof waste streams, petroleum refiners must sample their process streamsperiodically. As with maintenance, workers that sample process streamsare at risk of being in close contact with a variety of chemicals. Controlsfor this operation involve sampling boxes that vent gases and vapors awayfrom the operator and/or shield the operator from accidentally splashedor spilled material.Process stream samples are taken to the laboratory to determine if theirqualities lie within acceptable limits. As laboratory workers perform analyses,they can be exposed to various organic and inorganic chemicals if appropriateengineering controls are not in place or if proper procedures are not used.Exposure controls include exhaust fans and laboratory ventilation hoods.SIC 30_Rubber and Miscellaneous Plastics ProductsTo control dust while cutting reinforced plastic, a local exhaust fan wasinstalled at the back of the cutting instrument.The materials to be mixed in a Banbury mixer used in tire production (SIC3011) are charged into a hopper and then into a chamber which containsthe mixing rotors. The rotors mix the materials into a homogeneous mixture,and then are discharged through a drop door or slide gate. When the hotrubber mixture is discharged, it emits an aerosol which looks like smoke.These aerosols are typically well controlled. The operations and equipmentused to charge the mixer can be sources of dust exposures. The powderedchemicals in the operation are weighed in rigid plastic containers or paperbags, all of which are either emptied or dropped into the mixer by workers.This dropping, the handling of these contaminated containers or the crushingof the bags which contained chemicals, all expose the workers to dust.When the rubber and chemicals are charged using a charging conveyor, adust exposure can result from the use of kaolin as an anti-tack agent.The conveyor belt becomes contaminated by the kaolin. When workers placematerials on the conveyor, dust puffs into the worker's breathing zone.One design which minimizes dust dispersion is the use of an automated batchingsystem to isolate the worker from the dust. Other techniques include theuse of rubber bins on a tilt stand to charge carbon black rather than theuse of screw conveyors. The kaolin can be replaced by a soap anti-tackagent. To capture the aerosol fumes, a local exhaust hood can be placedby the drop gate between the legs of the mixer. Exhaust hoods may be placedby the hopper vents, on the carbon black charge chute, about the chargingdoor and surrounding the dust ring seal on the mixer ram.SIC 31_Leather and Leather ProductsToluene exposure in the shoe manufacturing industry (SIC 314) was decreasedby revising standard work practices to reduce the contact time betweenleather and toluene. This also reduced the generation of vapors.SIC 32_Stone, Clay and Glass ProductsIn batch mixing of raw materials for glass production (SICs 321 and 322)drysweeping and/or the use of compressed air for cleaning may contributesubstantially to the employees overall exposures. By substituting vacuumcleaning systems, worker exposure can be reduced.SIC 33_Primary Metals IndustriesIn the primary metal industries (including SICs 331, 332, 333, and 334),the overall size of the process equipment and buildings makes contaminantcontrol difficult. Local exhaust and general ventilation systems used inthis industry group must move large volumes of air as compared to similarsystems in other industries. Baghouses and other air cleaning devices usedin such systems must also be proportionally larger. This effect of scaletranslates to higher than average control costs, but use of ventilationcan control exposures to the proposed levels.SIC 331_Basic Steel ProductsPrimary metal products manufacturing (SIC 331) controlled dust with a sidedraft enclosure exhaust hood and a circular backdraft booth, both drivenby a blower-dust collector. Ventilation was provided by a freely suspendedhood and conical hood.The replacement of slide gates on transfer hoppers with butterfly-typevalves assisted in dust control in the material handling of electrometallurgicalproducts (SIC 3313).SIC 332_Iron and Steel FoundriesThe arc air process in steel foundries (SICs 3324, 3325) was used duringthe processing of steel castings to control fumes. In order to ventilatethe arc air booths, fumes were exhausted through the back of the boothand fresh air was supplied from above and behind the operator.Steel foundries (SICs 3324, 3325) used an overhead canopy hood during theinduction melting of steel to control fumes. The hood consisted of sheetmetal barriers extending down from the roof to the top of the hot metalladle monorail. Thermal drafts carried the fumes upward into the hood wherethey were exhausted by ventilators. Mancooler fans behind the workers pushedsome fumes under the hood.Emissions during the oxy-acetylene torch cutoff of risers from steel castingswas encountered in iron and steel foundries (SIC 332). Castings were cutin a specially designed booth with a rear exhaust flow and a frontal airsupply flow. Air pressure from the cutting nozzle of the torch was directedtoward the rear exhaust port for effective dust and fume control.Fume control of a sandwich-type inoculation in iron foundries (SICs 3321,3322) was achieved through the use of a commercially available canopy hood.The fume-laden air was exhausted through mobile duct work and cleaned bya fabric collector before being discharged into the surrounding environment.The hood tilted with the furnace so that it always was directly over theladle for fume capture.Fume, dust, and gas control from the melting of iron (SICs 3321, 3322)in an arc furnace was achieved by the installation of a hood. The exhaustscollected by the hood were filtered by cloth filters before being releasedinto the external environment.Control of dust and gas emissions from phenolic urethane cold box coremakingin iron foundries (SIC 3321, 3322) included local exhaust ventilation whichprovided negative pressure at the core box. Parting line gaskets, blowseals, and stripper pin o-rings were regularly maintained for emissioncontrol. Exhaust outlets captured excessive dust.In an iron foundry (SICs 3321, 3322), hot combustion gases were exhaustedand flowed through an after burner, cooled, and then passed through a dustcollector. Tapping emissions were captured by a canopy hood. General ventilationwas provided by mancooler fans.SIC 333/334_Primary and Secondary Non-Ferrous MetalsControl of emissions from aluminum ore handling and storage (SIC 3334)was addressed with an unloader which uses movable vacuum nozzles to removealumina and coke from barges. The ore was moved on an enclosed conveyorwhich was equipped with air exhaust hoods at loading and transfer points.The operator can be situated in an air conditioned cab.Reduction of alumina dust emissions during ship unloading (SIC 3334) wasachieved by automating and controlling operations from an enclosed controlbooth. Furthermore, mixing operations were hooded and exhausted.During anode rodding in prebake plants during primary aluminum production(SIC 3334), spent butt remover, butt crushers, cast iron remover, and shotcleaner were exhausted to a bag filter dust collector. Use of inductionfurnaces and exhaust hooding reduced metal fume exposure during melting.Hoods and slotted hoods were also used. The operator can maintain controlsfrom an enclosed console.Control of air emissions during potline operations of aluminum smelters(SIC 3334) was achieved through the use of potroom ventilation and automatedprocesses such as the use of hooding which consists of curved and ribbedshields, the employment of a dual draft system, and an exhaust system whichleads to a dry scrubber. Other control methods included hooding with rigidair-operated doors which exhausted the emissions through air takeoffs toan expanding duct exhaust manifold which, in turn, was exhausted by a fan.Furthermore, computer-controlled systems existed which could automaticallyperform production functions without requiring workers to open pots orhood shields above pots.The mercury cell process may be used in aluminum smeltering (SIC 3334)to produce chlorine gas from brine water. To reduce chlorine gas exposureas a result of this production, the diameter of the brine header was increasedto accommodate the gas phase above the liquid phase; the number of cellsin the system was increased; the pH of the brine was adjusted; the compressorcontrols were modified to accommodate surges in pressure; inlet box coverswere replaced with better covers; and the brine feed nozzle flange wasmodified.Several engineering controls have been recommended for copper smeltinglocations (SICs 3331, 3341). A preventive maintenance program can be developedand implemented to insure that ventilation and conveyor systems are operatingproperly. Dead beds can be installed in chutes to break the fall of materialand reduce the level of dust generated. Pneumatic aerators can be installedto eliminate the need for manual air lancing in bins and chutes. Industrialvacuum systems can be used.Collection hoods can be installed at each conveyor transfer point at coppersmelter sites (SICs 3331, 3341) to control copper particulate. Primarycopper smelting conveyor skirting can be properly adjusted, and fingersinstalled at discharge points. Inspection doors should not be left open,and the lunchroom/breakroom should be located outside of the reclaim building.General measures throughout copper smelting plants (SICs 3331, 3341) tocontrol copper dust emissions included: Using local exhaust ventilationfor localized sources, and general exhaust ventilation for areas with unidentifiablesources; enclosing conveyor belts and transfer points; enclosing the airconveying system for the transfer of flue dusts; enclosing workers' operatingvehicles; installing secondary hoods on converters; prohibiting the blowingout of converters while on stack; performing preventive maintenance onballoon flues; not allowing converters to remain rolled out for extendedperiods of time; and providing cleaning rooms with filtered, tempered,positive pressure air. When hauling slag from the metal smelting operation,slag can be granulated after skimming with high velocity water; a chemicaldust suppression system can be used when crushing any cooled slag; andthe slag crew can ride downwind from fumes. Further engineering controlsinclude constructing pulpits for operators; close-coupling the ventilationsystem to the Larry car; using dead beds in calcine loading; enclosinga portion of the building to block wind; and vacuuming the superstructureof the Larry car and any spills.Controls used to decrease exposures to arsenic, dust and sulfur dioxideat primary copper and lead smelters (SICs 3331, 3332) included upgradingthe present ventilation systems; operating electric furnaces at negativepressure; eliminating air lancing as a method of removing concentratesfrom receiving hoppers; using pneumatic aerators or belt wipes; using wettechniques in storage; reclaiming concentrates; and improving general housekeeping.Exposures to lead, cadmium, and arsenic at lead and copper smelters (SICs3331, 3332) were reduced by the replacement of old sintering machines withones equipped with dust and fume controls and by placing a cover over thecharge hole when slag was not being charged into the reverberatory furnace.Use of a multipurpose crane with an enclosed cab reduced operator exposuresto air emissions at carbon bake plants (SIC 3334). The cab was suppliedwith filtered conditioned air. The crane was equipped with a vacuum systemwhich could aspirate cake from ovens and separate fines.Controls for exposure to soluble platinum salts in precious metal refining(SIC 3339) included local exhaust ventilation used in jaw crusher and recoverysampling, maintenance of a closed system in refinery through use of glovebox filters, the use of borohydrate solution to wash down spills and reducesalts to insoluble platinum metal, and mandatory showers and daily clothingchanges.Controls for the primary non-ferrous metals industry (SIC 333) includedlocal exhaust ventilation systems; general dilution ventilation; covers,hoods and exhaust systems for belts, material handling and transfer systems;enclosure and exhaust of sinter machine area; local exhaust and dilutionventilation for the reverberatory and refinery areas. The reduction of exposures to inert cadmium and silver dust during a ballmill operation was accomplished by building and equipment process changessuch as local exhaust ventilation, hood enclosure of process or worker,and air cleaning equipment. In the secondary smelting and refining of non-ferrous metals (SIC 334),particulate emissions from a dross mill were reduced by making modificationsto the dust collection system and to air volumes drawn through the baghouse.Engineering controls used include increasing fan efficiency through theuse of sheaves and belts, installing water sprays on crusher infeeds, runningnew pipe to localized dust areas, installing additional cleanout ports,and replacing the top of the baghouse. Employee exposure to nuisance dust from zinc smelters (SIC 3333) was controlledby replacing the dross handling operation with a dross mill. The crusherwas replaced with a rotating mixer, thus eliminating fugitive dust fromthis part of the process.SIC 336_Non-Ferrous FoundriesFumes were controlled during the casting of bronze in foundries (SIC 3362)through the use of enclosing hoods. A mobile hood exhausted the ladle atall hot metal transfer points. Flexible ducting connected the hood to atraveling exhaust carriage.SIC 339_Miscellaneous Primary Metals Products Manufacturers improved dust control using closed screw conveyors in thetransport and manufacture of iron powder (SIC 3399). Open conveyor beltswere changed to a closed screw conveyor system. Duct work was totally replaced.Local exhaust was provided for the rotary screens. New baghouses and electrostaticprecipitators were also installed. SIC 34_Fabricated Metal Products Control of copper dust at a cookware manufacturing plant (SIC 3469) wasaddressed by unclogging the ventilation system, repositioning cooling fans,and instituting weekly ventilation system inspection and maintenance programs.A plating shop (SIC 3471) uses extensive local exhaust ventilation to controlworker exposure. Each part to the plated undergoes some surface pretreatment.This can consist of shot-peening, abrasive blasting, degreasing, wax ortape masking and other treatments. Parts are manually placed into the tankusing an overhead hoist for large parts. The tanks are set on top of concrete ducts. The floors of the shop andthe aisles between the tanks are reinforced concrete, however the areaaround the perimeter of the tank is open to the basement and covered bysteel grating. The ducts are connected to a fan on the roof of the building.The largest of the hard chrome tanks, holding over 1000 gallons of platingsolution, has a two sided lateral exhaust ventilation system. The sloton each side consists of a series of seven slots. The slots are set backfrom the edge of the tank but an overhanging hood extends to the edge ofthe tank. A second tank has both a two sided slot ventilation system anda cover. This two piece cover is hinged to a ventilation manifold and extendsbeyond the front and rear edges of the tank.Arc welding is performed in many SICs as an auxilliary process and in severalindustries such as fabricated structural metals (SIC 3441), as the principalprocess requiring engineering control. During the welding process, temperaturesare sufficiently high to vaporize some of the base material of the electrodeand produce large quantities of fumes containing the elements in the electrodeand the base metal. Thus welders and other workers in the vicinity areexposed to mixtures of fume-sized particulates and both irritant and toxicgases which in combination may have additive or synergistic physiologicaleffects.Differences in worker exposure are attributable to a variety of factorsincluding type of welding helmet worn, position of the welding operator,the work environment, arc time, and the availability and performance ofventilation equipment.Arc time varies greatly due to differences in work schedules, set up times,and the sizes, shapes and types of tasks. Tasks can vary from short-termrepairs conducted irregularly to full time production welding. During arc time the fume is generated within or close to the worker's breathingzone. Background fume concentrations could also be significant if a largenumber of welders are working or the work is being performed in a relativelyconfined space.Because of the numerous factors that can influence exposure levels duringwelding, four different types of controls can be used for various weldingsituations. The controls include: (1) Local exhaust ventilation for weldingin shops; (2) ambient air cleaning devices to minimize background fumeconcentrations; and (3) a portable blower for use in confined areas.Local exhaust ventilation configurations include: A welding bench witha backdraft hood for small to medium work pieces; a fixed close-capturehood placed at the back of a work rest table; a portable close-capturesystem including electrostatic precipitator; or an exhaust hose incorporatedinto the structure of the welding gun. Ambient air cleaning devices are designed to lower background welding fumeswhich escape collection by the local exhaust system. The ambient air cleaneris expected to surpass general dilution ventilation systems in terms ofboth fume removal and cost. A portable blower system works by exhausting fumes from a confined spacethrough a large flexible tube. SIC 35_MachineryEmployee exposure to welding fumes was controlled in the manufacture ofpumps (SIC 3561) through the use of an air lux fume eliminator.In the milling of tungsten carbide tools (SIC 354), the placement of localexhaust ventilation controlled cobalt exposures during the transfer ofcarbide. In farm equipment manufacturing and repair (SIC 3523), paint mist was controlledthrough sophisticated application techniques as applied to downdraft spraybooths. The use of heated paint in the painting of hay stack wagons allowedthe airless atomization to take place at relatively low paint pressures.This resulted in low droplet velocity with little rebound. SIC 36_Electric and Electronic EquipmentElectric lamp manufacturers (SIC 3641) have reduced mercury vapor in lightingplants. Glass pellets used as starters for fluorescent lamps were flamesealed after mercury had been injected into them. Overhead suction velocityof the exhaust system was increased to reduce mercury overexposure. Also,a special vacuum cleaner was employed to clean the turntable. SIC 37_Transportation EquipmentA four-sided enclosure with electrostatic precipitator ventilation wasused on the welding table in the manufacture of travel trailers (SIC 3792).Engineering controls for styrene exposure in the fiberglass boat worksindustry (SIC 3732) included flexible duct exhaust ventilation that istransportable to the employee's point of operation. General recommendations in the reinforced plastic boat making industryincluded local exhaust, the use of styrene-suppressed resins, and goodwork practices. In the manufacturing of aircraft engine parts (SIC 3724), a hood was installedabove an abrasive cutoff saw to capture the cobalt dust produced.In the repairing and rebuilding of railroad cars (SIC 3743), present exhaustfans were relocated, cleaned and serviced and ``upblast'' roof ventilatorfans were installed, thus changing the air every 15 minutes.SIC 38_Instruments Many fluxing agents are used in soldering and brazing operations duringinstrument manufacture. In most cases, these fluxes give of acid or alkalifumes when heated that can irritate the skin. Conducting soldering andbrazing operations in well-ventilated areas and use of protective clothingand gloves is recommended. For many soldering and brazing operations, control of fumes and vaporsgenerated by dilution ventilation will be sufficient. That is, enough freshair is added to the contaminated air that hazardous concentrations do notdevelop. Local exhaust ventilation is the most effective means of control for airbornecontaminants produced by the soldering or brazing process. Local exhaustventilation can be provided by several types of equipment: freely movablehoods, fixed enclosures (booths), and down-draft benches. A freely movable hood consists of a movable hood attached to a fan. Thefan draws air from the work space and exhausts it outdoors, either directlyor through a dust collection system. The hoods are normally constructedso that they can be moved into place by the solderer. The air handlingsystem should move air at least 100 feet per minute across the solderingsite at even the most remote point from the exhaust opening. It is importantthat the exhaust hood be placed as near as possible to the work being done.As such, the proper functioning of a freely movable hood is dependent upongood work practices of the solderer. In some instances soldering or brazing operations carried out in a fixedlocation can be provided with a fixed enclosure. This is a structure builtaround the soldering or brazing operation which has a top and at leasttwo sides. A means for drawing air through the work area is provided sothat the work space is flushed continuously with fresh air. Within such an enclosure, work should be arranged and conducted in sucha way that the fresh air enters in the enclosure through the worker's breathingzone and then through the work space in which the contaminants are produced.For most fixed enclosures, the air should move at least 100 feet per minuteacross the entrance to the enclosure. A third type of local exhaust ventilation system is the down-draft benchor table. The soldering or brazing is performed on a bench or table whichhas an open grid as the work surface. Air is drawn downward through thegrid, into the duct work, and then exhausted.SIC 39_Miscellaneous Manufacturing In the manufacturing of hard surface floor coverings (SIC 3996), processesinclude pre-weighing and blending raw materials, followed by mixing andgelling of the composition in internal batch mixers of the Banbury typeor by continuous mixing operations carried out in mixers of the extrudertype. Potential worker exposures may result from dusts of the raw materials asthey are handled (automatically or manually) prior to and during chargingof the mixer. Fumes and dusts can emanate from leaks on the mixer and fromhot, freshly mixed material as it is discharged. The types of exposures depend on the substances used, though dusts of anytype can constitute exposure to nuisance particulates. Applicable exposurecontrols include local exhaust ventilation at the mixer doors and overconveyor transfer points. The use of good working practices is extremelyeffective in controlling exposures during the opening of the mixers andthe pouring of materials. SICs 40, 45, 47_Transportation Cleaning and coating operations are conducted in rail (SIC 40), and airtransport industries (SIC 45), as well as in transportation services (SIC47). These operations require the application of cleaning agents and/orthe sandblasting of particles prior to the application of paints or coating.Spraying processes are required for the application of both the cleaningagents and the paints and coatings.Rail car applications, for example, are generally performed within a largefacility, part of which is established as a spray room. The cars are rolledinto an enclosed spray area. In manual spray painting rooms, the operatoris required to enter and move about the enclosure during spraying. Automaticspray rooms (or booths) are similar but the pressurized spray guns areautomatically operated. Three major spray techniques are used to apply cleaning agents, coatingsor paints. These are: Compressed air spraying (low pressure spraying);airless spraying (high-pressure spraying); and electrostatic spraying.The compressed air spray gun atomizes a stream of liquid by impaction witha jet of air. Atomization may take place inside or external to the gun.The air stream and paint droplets intersect the prepared surface. The airlessspray gun atomizes the liquid by forcing it through a small orifice underhigh pressure. The resulting particulate cloud is impelled by the pressure-createdmomentum toward the surface. Electrostatic spray equipment is based uponthe attractive force between two oppositely charged objects. The liquidis atomized by compressed air, airless, or electrostatic techniques. Theparticles are given either positive or negative charge and the conductivesurface to be sprayed is grounded. In general, electrostatic spray techniquesresult in the lowest exposure levels, followed by airless and then compressedair spraying. In enclosed spray rooms, particulates enter the operator's breathing zonedue to backspray. Exhaust ventilation to control exposure can be designedusing down draft or a multiple sidedraft system. Worker positioning inrelation to the spray plume is also critical in minimizing exposures. Theseinclude minimized line pressure, changing and cleaning of filter banks,enclosure integrity and ventilation maintenance. Personal protective equipmentis also generally worn to insure the worker protection. SIC 49_Electric, Gas and Sanitary Services Coal-fed power plants present the potential for exposure to coal dust aswell as a number of other substances. Coal dust exposure potentially occurin the area where coal is fed into the furnaces. The coal is generallyfed into large hoppers off conveyors. Conveyors are filled by front-endloaders from the coal storage area. The operators of the front-end loadersare protected from coal dust exposure with the use of closed, air-conditionedcabs which provide purified breathing air.SICs 50 and 51_Wholesale TradeSome firms in this classification receive liquid chemicals in bulk quantitiesfrom a tank truck, store them and then redistribute them in smaller containers.Solvents, for example, emit considerable vapor when poured from one containerto another or when a container is being filled, displacing the air in it.Pouring and filling operations are often enclosed to minimize vapor losses(this helps to reduce product loss as well as prevent exposures). In addition,secondary vapor recovery is often incorporated, whereby vapors emittedat the transfer points are captured and returned through a separate circuitto the storage tank from which the volatile liquid is being removed.SIC 72_Personal ServicesTo control dry cleaning emissions (SICs 7216, 7217), louvered wall fansand grilled ducts were installed to provide ventilation. Ceiling exhaustfans provided general ventilation. Natural ventilation was provided bythrough doors in the production area and by louvered panels along wallsin the plant. Forced ventilation was provided by ceiling mounted exhaustfans and evaporative coolers. A local exhaust system with a standard singlefloor pickup exhausted air through a carbon absorption unit to the outside.Gaskets in machinery doors and ductwork needed routine maintenance to preventdeterioration. Various cleaning machines, pressure filter extractors anddryers were used. Dryers and drying cabinets were provided with local exhaustventilation.SIC 73_Business ServicesBlueprinting and photocopying firms (7332) control ammonia fumes from blueprintduplication machines through use of local exhaust ventilation. The exhaustsystem is often built into large, high volume machines. Improvements inwork practices control exposures during transfer.SIC 55, 75_Automotive Repair Shops, DealersIn automobile engine reconditioning lines (SIC 7538), exhaust fans andflexible ducts which extend directly over the engines were installed inorder to control carbon monoxide exposure.SIC 76_Miscelleanous Repair ServicesControl techniques for welding fumes (SIC 7692) included a ``smoke exhaust''welding gun which captures and removes fumes. These guns have some limitationsand are applicable to continuous or semicontinuous flux core or metal inertgas welding operations. Crossdraft airflow was also suggested. The useof a portable fan is not recommended.SIC 80_Health ServicesMany medical and dental practitioners perform surgery in outpatient clinicsand private offices outfitted for the procedure. Air contamination in anoperating room may consist of waste anesthetic, the propellants of differentsprays, scrubbing agents, cleansing agents, methylmethacrylate (releasedfrom surgical cement) and the possible decomposition products of the volatileor gaseous agents. The magnitude of gas flow, type of flow circuit andscavenging of waste gases significantly influence the levels of waste gasesin the room air. Exposures are usually controlled by general dilution ventilation.Some clinics and offices, which are specifically designed for surgicaluse, may have local exhaust systems installed.Personal Protective EquipmentIn the operations and processes included in Supplement 2 reductions inexposure limits can be achieved through engineering controls and work practicenotifications. However, certain generic work activities are more problematicaland may require the use of personal protection equipment.Examples of these are:<T3>Maintenance Activities in all SIC codes.</T3> It may be more difficultto control exposures of plant maintenance personnel by using engineeringcontrols except for activities taking place in the maintenance shops. Thesemaintenance employees may work in areas not normally accessed by productionworkers or may work under conditions which normal production workers donot. Respiratory protection is sometimes the appropriate control technology.<T3>Painting and Coating Activities in all SIC codes.</T3> Although spraypainting operations are performed in exhausted paint booths, the paintingof many larger non-production items, such as construction equipment andheavy machinery, requires that the operator enter the booth. The boothis then primarily a control to prevent migration of the paint spray intoother areas of the plant. In these circumstances it is usually necessaryto provide respiratory protection to the workers painting.<T3>Exterminating.</T3> Exposure of pesticide applicators cannot be controlledthrough engineering controls because their work does not take place ina fixed place of employment, but rather at a customer's facility. Personalprotective equipment and/or work practice controls would therefore be required.EPA has jurisdiction in most situations.<T3>Welding </T3>In certain situations, such as in confined spaces, orwhere the welder must be positioned directly above the fume plume, welderscannot be sufficiently protected by local exhaust ventilation. Personalprotective equipment would be required.In addition to the above examples, a number of the substances includedin this rulemaking carry the designation ``Skin.'' This refers to potentialexposure through the skin. Table V-1 presents a list of chemicals for whichskin protection would be required. Employees exposed to substances withthe ``Skin'' notation would be required to wear protective equipment, includinggloves, long sleeved shirts and coveralls.Products are commercially available to adequately protect workers fromdermal exposure. In some cases the permeability of currently used materialsmay be inadequate and firms will have to change the specific product nowused to one offering greater protection.<ITAG

Costs of Compliance</ITAG>Costs of compliance result from the purchase, installation, operation andmaintenance of equipment to maintain workers' exposures at or below thelevels specified in the proposed standard. Costs are related to the engineeringcontrols needed for specific processes which involve the use of hazardoussubstances. Existing data sources and expert judgement were used to sortthe approximately 430 substances being regulated, by industry and by processwithin industry segments. Given the large number of substances being regulated,a process orientation rather than a chemical specific focus, was recommended,since prescribed engineering controls can address worker exposure problemsto several chemicals, involving the same general process, simultaneously.The approach has proven to be efficient analytically and reduces the problemof double counting the costs of similar or the same engineering controlsfor separate chemicals involved in the same process or operation.OSHA has a large amount of exposure data in its Integrated Management InformationSystem and from NIOSH and other sources. But to improve the available informationon the use of substances, OSHA decided to engage in a nationwide fieldsurvey of affected establishments. This survey, involving over 5,300 establishmentsin both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors, has provided valuableinformation on chemical usage by industry process and potential workerexposures to these chemicals. Supplement 1 contains a description of thesample survey design and a statistical evaluation of the data collected.In order to maximize the efficiency of this nationwide sample survey andlimit the number of required sample observations per SIC category, a considerableeffort was made to verify chemical by industry usage from existing datasources and to make best estimates of where likely or potential workersexposure problems (and consequently engineering costs) existed. For thepurposes of the statistical survey being conducted, the larger the suspectedpotential exposure/cost problem in a particular industry sector, the moreimportant it was to insure a large enough sample of firms in that sectorso as to reduce the standard error of the cost estimates.The following sections of this chapter outline the methodology adoptedto identify:andbullet; Chemicals by their industrial usage and employee exposuresandbullet; Processes involving known or suspected schemical exposures andcontrol costsandbullet; Industry costs for the controls needed to reduce industry exposurelevelsLinking Hazardous Substances by Industry Use and Employee ExposureFigure VI-1 presents a flow chart of the methodology used for identifyingchemicals by industry use and employee exposure. The first step in themethodology was an analysis of the chemicals for which OSHA proposes newexposure limits. The 1982 NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES)and the OSHA IMIS data files was searched to determine the potential forworker exposure to each of the chemicals on the proposed list. The objectiveof this analysis was to create a subset of chemicals which are known tobe present in specific industries at exposure levels above the proposedlimits. These chemicals would then be considered to generate potentialcompliance costs within a specific industry sector.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1189</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>The 1982 NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) data (supplementedby results from NIOSH's 1972 survey) provided an estimate of the numberof workers potentially exposed to a specific chemical in a four-digit SIC.OSHA divided this estimate by the total number of employees in an industrysegment to get a percentage of workers potentially exposed to that chemical.If 5 percent or more of the workers were potentially exposed, that chemicalwas considered to present a potential cost within the four-digit SIC. Forexample, in SIC 3011, Tires and Innertubes Manufacturing, 1,532 personswere potentially at risk of exposure to n-hexane at the sample of plantsincluded in the NOES database. This represented 21.9 percent of all workerssampled in the four digit industry sector and this chemical would havea potential cost impact depending upon current exposure levels.From the OSHA IMIS data, the severity of exposure within a four-digit SICwas estimated. OSHA compared the total number of monitored readings foreach chemical with the number of readings which exceeded the proposed limitsand calculated the percentage of all sample monitor readings which wereabove the proposed limits. If there were no readings which exceeded theproposed limits, the chemical was not considered to have a compliance costwithin the four digit SIC. If 5 percent or more of the readings exceededthe proposed limits, then the chemical was identified as having a potentialcompliance cost within the four-digit SIC. For example, in SIC 2641, PaperCoating and Glazing, 22 samples were taken for n-hexane. Thirteen of these,or 59 percent, were above the proposed standard for n-hexane. This chemical,therefore, was believed to have a potential cost impact and questions regardingits use were included in the field survey. Chemicals with non-compliancepercentages between zero and 5 percent were evaluated individually by industrialhygienists to determine whether or not specific survey questions neededto be asked about their industrial usage.In addition to the IMIS and NOES databases, a survey of about one dozenindustrial hygienists was conducted (under personal services contracts).The purpose of this survey was to identify any additional hazardous substancesor industry sectors not identified in the IMIS or NOES databases with potentialexposure problems at new recommended levels. For example, in SIC 2891,Adhesives and Sealants Manufacturing, the surveyed industrial hygienistsreported that n-hexane overexposures could exist under the proposed standard.(Overexposures in SIC 2891 were not previously identified in the IMIS orNOES databases.)The information from all sources was combined to compile a preliminarylist of substances with potential compliance costs by four-digit SIC classification.To further refine the list of chemicals, a second group of six industrialhygienists, using personal industry knowledge and the information gatheredfrom the survey of the initial group of industrial hygienists, reviewedonce again the chemicals which appeared in the NOES and IMIS datasets.They also made chemicals by industry use linkages when particular chemicalswere known to be present in certain SICs, but had not been identified inthe NOES and IMIS data bases.Upon completion of the two-tier industrial hygienist review, a list ofchemicals believed to be present at exposure levels above the proposedstandard, within specific four-digit SIC industry sectors was finalized.This list identified those industry segments with potential compliancecosts needed to comply with the proposed standards. This chemical by industrylisting is presented in Supplement 2 of this Appendix.Industrial Processes and Control CostsThe number of industrial processes, exposure levels and exposure controlsin place varies greatly within industry segments. In order to efficientlystructure the statistical sample of surveyed firms, it was necessary tomake a best estimate of which industry segments were likely to experiencecompliance costs. As noted above, the survey was designed to limit thestandard error for potential high cost industry sectors. To concentratethe survey on the potential high cost sectors, a process orientation wasadopted which supplemented and refined the chemical use information. Industrysectors with very low incidence of processes and chemicals with low potentialexposure levels (and consequently low potential compliance costs) wereincluded in the sample survey.A team of engineers and industrial hygienists analyzed each four digitSIC to assess the processes in which worker exposure to listed chemicalsoccur. Examples of industrial processes included grinding, mixing, spraying,degreasing, separation, bagging and loading. A list of potential cost chemicalsand related processes was then developed to identify potentially high impact(cost) industries. Supplement 2 presents the chemical by process listingfor each four digit SIC covered by the sample survey. In general, an industrysegment with a relatively large number of processes using chemicals withsuspected high exposure levels was sampled at the three digit industrylevel. Industries with fewer processes and low chemical exposures weresampled at the two digit level. (See Supplement 1 for a more detailed explanationof the survey design.)Each of the over 5,300 respondents in the survey was asked to verify thechemicals used, manufactured or generated by process within the establishment.Thus, chemicals were linked to specific processes, process controls andworkers exposed at the process in the surveyed industries. Control methodsand costs were then assigned for each process where employee exposureswould exceed the proposed PELs.Controls were assigned to protect workers exposed to all chemicals in totalat a process. The controls were designed and costed to lower exposure tothe chemical(s) with the greatest change in the permissible exposure limit(PEL). It was the judgment of the experts involved that by assigning controlsfor the ``major'' chemicals, exposures for all other chemicals would becontrolled. Chemicals and/or processes not included in the proposed standard(e.g., those covered by separate 6(b) rulemaking) were excluded from thesurvey. Examples of chemicals not included in the survey are asbestos,formaldehyde and benzene.Survey information collected from each respondent include:andbullet; Type of processes at the establishment;andbullet; Type and amount of chemical used, manufactured, or generated ineach process;andbullet; Number of work stations and workers related to the process;andbullet; Potential chemical exposure above the proposed standards (monitoringdata, recorded overexposures) at the process;andbullet; Process location (indoors/outdoors), and configuration (size,full enclosure, partial enclosure);andbullet; Ventilation or other controls in place; andandbullet; Economic and other characteristics of the plant.A computer algorithm was developed to assess survey data to determine ifpotential worker overexposure and therefore compliance costs occur foreach process at an establishment. Figure VI-2 presents a general diagramof the computer logic adopted for use in the survey. The logic assessespotential overexposures on the basis of: Actual reported monitoring data;statements that overexposures occur; and the particular process location,configuration, type and amount of chemical use and existing controls inplace.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1195-1196</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>When a respondent provided actual monitoring data for a process that indicatedchemical exposures above the proposed standard, compliance costs were assignedto that process on the basis of prescribed controls for the given process.Where no monitoring data or reports of overexposure were available, thecomputer algorithm logic examined process and chemical characteristicsto determine if workers at the process were potentially exposed to chemicalsat levels over the proposed standard. The logic assessed the controls reportedto be in place at the process and compared them with a list of controlsthrought necessary to control exposures in that process within the industry.When the requried controls were reported to be in place, no compliancecost was assigned. When the required controls were not reported to be inplace, a compliance cost per work station was assigned.The computer algorithm determined that some processes within plants hadno potential overexposures and consequently no compliance costs. Zero compliancecosts resulted where no proceses and/or chemicals were reported to occurat the establishment. Zero compliance costs also resulted when the respondenthad monitored a process using ACGIH or NIOSH standards and found no overexposures.Where only very small quantities of chemicals, none of which were designedas ``major'' proposed exposure limit changes were present in a process,no overexposure was determined and zero compliance costs assigned. Themajor/minor designation was based on the proposed change in the PEL (overor under a 50 percent decrease) as well as chemical characteristics suchas form, particle size, and vapor pressure.Process configurations and location also were indications of compliance.Processes which were reported as completely enclosed with no worker entrywere assumed to be in complaince with the proposed standard (have no compliancecost). Outdoor loading/offloading processes or other outdoor processeswith no chemicals with ``major'' proposed exposure limit changes were assumednot to require control equipment and costs. Zero compliance costs werealso assessed where processes which required control equipment reportedthat the prescribed equipment was currently in place.An example of a process which was assigned a cost of compliance to installengineering controls is a coating and spraying process in SIC 2511, WoodHousehold Furniture. The survey respondent reported that toluene, n-butylalcohol and xylene were used in this operation. The proposed standard fortoluene reduces the existing PEL by 50 percent. This reduction is consideredto require concerted exposure control and is considered a ``major'' proposedexposure limit change. Because workers were involved in the process andthe process was reported to be neither located outdoors nor fully enclosed,controls were assumed necessary to insure compliance with the proposedstandard. The control required for controlling exposures at this processwas determined as local ventilation. The type of local ventilation prescribedin this case is a spray booth at an estimated cost of $3,070 annually perwork station. Because the respondent reported no local ventilation, thecost was assigned for the eight work stations reported, resulting in atotal estimated annual cost of $24,560 for this process at this site.Expert engineering and industrial hygiene judgment was used to determinewhich of the various controls would be necessary to control for exposuresby process in the affected industries. Engineering controls identifiedincluded exhaust ventilation (local and general); process enclosure; andprocess change. Some or all of these will be required by affected plantsfor compliance with the proposed exposure levels. In addition, personalprotective equipment such as respirators will be needed for intermittentmaintenance activities where engineering controls are not feasible. Skinand eye protection may also be required in certain situations.The engineers and industrial hygienists classified the approximately 180specific processes identified in the survey into about 20 process groupsfor the purpose of assessing required controls and estimating costs. Theseprocess groupings were based on similarities in the processes and levelsand types of exposures resulting from the process. Factors used to groupprocesses include the chemicals generally invovled in the process, typeand usual configuration of the equipment, usual work station design, leveland route of exposure, industry group where the process exists and workertasks in relation to the equipment and exposure route. The process similaritiestranslated into likenesses in required controls such as type of ventilationhood, booth or enclosure, air flow rates, duct configuration and type andsize of filters or scrubbers. The compliance costs framework is presentedin Figure VI-3. This figure presents the process groups, the industrieswhere the processes were identified, the general classification of controlsspecified and work station unit costs for the required controls assigned.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1200-1201</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>The development of unit costs for each control configuration required thedevelopment of ``model'' control designs. Model configurations were selectedto provide exposure control at ``typical'' process/work stations with thespecified process group. This costing approach (``model'' configurationsfor ``typical'' work stations) required the differentiation of some processgroupings as major or minor. The major/minor differentiation addressesthe expected level of control required.The control designs were developed by engineers based on their experiencein industry and extensive secondary research on operations and exposuresituations in each industry sector. This research included an examinationof industry and industrial hygiene journals, engineering process reports,and texts. Included in the detailed cost calculations for the control configurationswere costs for enclosure construction, baffles, fans, ductwork, filters,scrubbers, baghouses, and all other equipment required for exposure control.All of the costs were developed on a per work station basis so that anaverage size did not need to be estimated for the process. Investment costswere assigned to each control design on the basis of engineering handbooksand supplier catalogs. Investment costs were annualized over the projectedlife of equipment (10 years) using a 10 percent cost of capital and addingannual operating and maintenance costs estimated at 10 percent of the capitalcost. Respirator costs for use by maintenance workers for intermittentactivities were considered annual costs and include the respirator purchaseas well as an estimated year's work of cartridges and canisters.Process control costs were summed per establishment and any maintenanceworker respirator requirements cost included. A total annualized capitalcost and annual operating cost was developed for each establishment. Costsfor the survey establishment were then weighted (by SIC and size) to representcompliance costs for the universe of affected plants.Projected Impact by Industry SectorFollowing the methodology described in the preceding section of this chapter,annual compliance costs were estimated by industry sector. The costs presentedare based on the data collected from the over 5,300 survey respondents.(For industries not included in the survey, expert judgment and secondarysources were used for estimating costs.) A small percentage of respondents(less than 5 percent) actually provided monitoring data during the survey.However, based on survey data it was determined that about 86.1 percentof all establishments in the surveyed industries have no exposures in excessof the proposed standard and will not incur any costs to comply with theproposed standard. Only 11.1 percent of all establishments in the surveyedindustries will incur costs to provide engineering controls for processeswithin the plant. However, over 20 percent of the firms which reportedusing the chemicals being regulated, will incur some engineering controlcosts. About 2.8 percent of the establishments in the surveyed industrieswill be required to provide personal protective equipment only for maintenanceworkers whose intermittent operations cannot be controlled with engineeringcontrols.Table VI-I presents the total annualized capital and annual operating costfor compliance with the proposed standard by industry. As shown, annualcompliance costs are estimated to total $927.8 million. These costs representan estimate of compliance costs for large and small plants in the universeof establishments to be affected by the proposed standard. Industries withsome anticipated cost impact are identified below in order of the totalannual compliance costs estimated.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1204</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Manufacturing </ITAG><T3>Lumber and Wood Products (SIC 24).</T3> The annual costs of compliancein the lumber and wood products industry are estimated to total $196.1million. The compliance costs for this sector are heavily weighted by thecost of controls required to lower exposures to the proposed limits forwood dust. The survey indicated that sanding and other ``dusty'' processeswould require controls to lower wood dust exposure. The large number ofestablishments that must engineer ventilation systems for wood dust controlaccount for the substantial proportion of compliance costs to be incurredby small establishments in this sector. In addition to wood dust, controls for exposures to solvents and otherchemicals in coating processes and exposures to wood preserving chemicalsare estimated to result in compliance costs in SIC 24. Overall, about afourth of all establishments is SIC 24 are estimated to incur compliancecosts. <T3>Printing and Allied Industries (SIC 27). </T3>Compliance costs in theprinting industry sectors (an estimated $75.7 million) would result fromventilation requirements to control exposures to cleaning solvents andink spray generated within the printing process. A very large number ofsmall establishments are involved in printing and over 4,600 of them wouldbe affected by the proposed standards. The survey indicated that a largenumber of small establishments currently lack exposure controls and provisionof these controls account for the high control costs in this sector. <T3>Rubber and Miscellaneous Plastics Products (SIC 30).</T3> Annual costsof compliance in this industry sector are estimated to total about $75.5million. Controls were required for processes such as molding, and vulcanizing.Worker exposure to chemical vapors require the addition of local ventilationto many processes. The miscellaneous plastic products industry (SIC 3079)accounts for over 20 percent of the annual costs in this sector. The costsin SIC 3079 result from the high proportion of small plants in this sectorwhich will incur costs of compliance. Controls are required in SIC 3079for many crushing and grinding operations used to prepare plastic materialfor hot processes. <T3>Machinery Except Electrical (SIC 35) and Electrical Machinery (SIC36).</T3> The machinery manufacturing sectors together are estimated toincur total annual compliance costs of $89.5 million. Machinery exceptelectrical accounts for $57.7 million of this total. The electrical machinerysector is estimated to require $31.8 million in annual compliance costs.Controls in these sectors would be required for exposures to metals, solventsand nuisance dusts. <T3>Fabricated Metal Products Manufacturing (SIC 34).</T3> Plating andcoating establishments (SIC 347) and miscellaneous fabricated products(SIC 349) would account for a major portion of the $55.9 million annualcosts in SIC 34. Worker exposures in this industry sector result from chemicalsused in plating processes, solvents and coatings, metals and dusts. Thesurvey indicated that ventilation systems are not now present at many ofthe processes with chemical exposure. <T3>Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (SIC 37).</T3> Annual costsof compliance for SIC 37 are estimated at $47.1 million. Costs in the truckand car body and motor vehicle parts sectors (SICs 3711, 3713, 3714) wouldaccount for a large percentage of the costs in SIC 37. Controls may beneeded in order to control exposures to heavy metals, solvents, weldingfumes and a large variety of other chemicals at large scale hot processes.Additionally, costs in small plants in this sector will include complianceactivities to control exposures to styrene and other chemicals in smallboat construction, as well as trailer and recreational vehicle insulation.<T3>Primary Metal Manufacturing (SIC 33).</T3> The annual costs of compliancein primary metal manufacturing are estimated to total $40.3 million. Thisestimate derived from the survey may somewhat undercount the compliancecosts required in this sector. The cost algorithm assigned costs whereprescribed controls were not in place. While many establishments in SIC33 had controls in place, it is possible that the controls were not alloperationally sufficient to control missions to the levels of the proposedstandard. The compliance costs for this sector are heavily weighted by the cost ofcontrols required in large establishments in this segment. Blast furnaceestablishments, and primary foundries contain large numbers of hot processeswhich require controls. Control of emissions from hot metal processes tothe levels indicated in the proposed standard will require large increasesin the amount of air being moved through the ventilation systems. Additionally,costs will be required to enlarge the capacity of scrubbers and baghouseoperations. <T3>Chemicals and Allied Products (SIC 28).</T3> Annual compliance costsin SIC 28 are estimated to total $40.2 million. Over 25 percent of thecosts in SIC 28 are estimated to occur in paints and allied products manufacturing(SIC 2851). The survey indicated that a large proportion of plants willrequire additional controls for the number and type of substances usedin paint and paint product manufacturing. There are many chemicals in thisindustry segment which present exposure problems in a variety of wet anddry processes, including reaction, separation, crushing, mixing, dryingand bagging. Industry group SIC 282, Plastics Materials, Synthetic Resins, SyntheticRubber also accounts for a major portion (about 22 percent) of compliancecosts in this sector. Compliance costs are related to ventilation and otherrequirements to control carbon disulfide and other emissions in the manufactureof plastics materials and synthetic rubber. <T3>Food and Kindred Products (SIC 20). </T3>Costs are projected for alarge number of establishments in this sector. The prepared feeds and feedingredients, not elsewhere classified (SIC 2048) are estimated to accountfor a large percentage of the $33.5 million annual costs in SIC 20. Controlsmay be necessary for dust exposures and chemical fumigants. <T3>Paper and Allied Products (SIC 26).</T3> Annual costs in the paperand allied products industry are estimated to be $31.3 million. Much ofthe estimated costs in SIC 26 will be associated with the cost of controlsin large pulp mill and associated operations. Pulp mills are operated separately(those listed in SIC 2611) or as part of paper or paperboard mills (SIC2621 and SIC 2631 respectively). The cost of compliance in these operationswould result from controlling the large quantities of chemicals used inbreaking down the pulp to form cellulose and the reactions that occur inthe digesting process. The digesting and bleaching operations requiredfurther ventilation or enclosure. <T3>Apparel and Other Finished Products (SIC 23) and Textile Mill Products(SIC 22).</T3> These sectors have a large number of establishments whichmay incur compliance costs. The apparel industry is estimated to incurabout $31.7 million in annual compliance costs. Many of the affected establishmentsin SIC 23 may require controls for cleaning solvents such as perchloroethyleneas well as nuisance dusts. The $24.5 million annual costs in the textileindustry are estimated to result from control of exposures to dusts, solvents,dyes and other substances. <T3>Stone, Clay, Glass and Concrete Product Manufacturing (SIC 32).</T3>The stone, clay, glass and concrete product industry is estimated to incurcompliance costs of about $22.5 million. A major part of the annual costsin this industry segment may occur in the concrete, gypsum and plasterproducts (SIC 327) industries. According to the survey, controls in thissector are primarily expected to control nuisance particulates generatedduring large scale crushing, grinding and sizing operations. <T3>Miscellaneous Manufacturing (SIC 39).</T3> This industry accounts fora wide range of products, processes and chemical exposures. About halfof the establishments that would incur the $18.2 million annual cost inthe industry are believed to be included in SIC 3999, miscellaneous manufacturingnot elsewhere classified. <T3>Furniture and Fixtures (SIC 25).</T3> Annual costs of compliance inthe furniture and fixtures industries are estimated to total $14.7 million.Costs to control wood dust exposures during sanding, cutting and otherdusting processes are the major components of compliance costs in thissector. Establishments would also incur costs for control of coatings andsolvents. The survey indicated that the furniture sectors which includemetal working (SICs 2514, 2515, 2522, 2542, 2591 and 2599) would also requirecontrols for welding fumes and various metal particulates resulting fromgrinding and other processes. <T3>Instruments Manufacturing (SIC 38).</T3> Annual control costs in SIC38 are estimated to total $13.5 million. Exposures in this sector are toa large number of chemicals used within instruments and to dust, metalsand solvents. <T3>Petroleum Refining and Related Products (SIC 29).</T3> Petroleum refiningmay account for a large percentage of the $7.2 million annual costs inSIC 29, even though a relatively limited number of establishments in thepetroleum refining industry would require additional controls. This industryhas extensive control technology in place as well as many closed processeswith few exposed workers. <T3>Other Manufacturing.</T3> The lowest costs of compliance in the manufacturingsectors are expected to occur in SIC 21, Tobacco Manufacturers, ($0.02million) and SIC 31, Leather and Leather Products ($2.6 million). It isestimated that very few plants will incur costs in the tobacco manufacturingindustry. In the leather and leather products industry sector, most ofthe affected establishments produce manufactured leather goods. <ITAG tagnum="81">Transportation, Communication, Utilities </ITAG>The transportation and utilities sectors (SICs 40, 45, 47, and 49) includea large number of establishments. However, operations at Railroad (SIC40), and Air Transport establishments (SIC 45) are subject to regulationby other Federal agencies in addition to OSHA. Consequently, the numberof establishments which would incur costs to comply with the proposed standardare limited. For railroads, OSHA's standards normally apply to off-trackoperations. <T3>Electric, Gas and Sanitary Service Utilities (SIC 49).</T3> Annualcost in the utilities sectors are estimated to total $22.7 million. Costswould result from installation and improvement of controls necessary foractivities such as boiler/furnace feed preparation in electric services,odorant addition by natural gas companies, and water treatment and purificationof water supplies. <T3>Transportation Services Sector (SIC 47).</T3> The $1.8 million annualcosts in the SIC 47 may primarily be incurred in SIC 4789, transportationservices not elsewhere classified. This sector includes establishmentswhich provide incidental services such as cleaning railroad ballast andother rail car maintenance. <ITAG tagnum="81">Wholesale and Retail Trade </ITAG>Costs in the wholesale trade sectors (SICs 50, 51), are estimated to totalabout $12.9 million annually. A large percentage of the total number ofestablishments which would incur costs to comply with the proposed ruleare in SIC 5093, scrap and waste materials, wholesale. The only retail trade sector expected to incur compliance costs, Auto Dealers(SIC 55) is estimated to incur $12.0 million annually. These costs resultfrom the potentially large number of motor vehicle dealers (SIC 5511) whichmay incur compliance costs to control exposures to paints, coatings andsolvents during vehicle spray and coating operations. The costs resultfrom the installation of paint spray booths. <ITAG tagnum="81">Services </ITAG>The services sectors, SICs 72, 73, 75, 76 and 80 are estimated to totalabout $51.0 in annual compliance costs. The major costs (61.3 percent)in these sectors would result from potential compliance activities in SIC721, laundry, cleaning and garment services. Establishments in SIC 721would incur annual operating and annualized capital costs to control exposuresfor dry cleaning operations. Additional costs in the service sectors may result from control of solventchemicals in SIC 734, building services, control of welding fumes at weldingrepair operations (SIC 7692), control of solvent and photographic chemicalsin mailing, reproduction, commercial art and photography and stenographicservices (SIC 733), and local ventilation for exposure control in SIC 8071,medical laboratories. Per Plant Average Costs Table VI-2 presents the estimated average per plant annual cost of complianceby industry sector. Costs shown in this Table are calculated only for thoseestablishments in a sector which would incur costs. Average per plant annualoperating and annualized capital costs for all affected establishmentsacross industry sectors is estimated at $9,200. The per plant cost forlarge plants is $14,400 and for small plants with fewer than 20 employees,$6,300.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1213 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C001</ITAG>The highest costs on an average per plant basis are expected to occur inSIC 24. Average per plant costs in SIC 24 may total $52,800 in annual operatingand annualized capital costs. This per plant cost is heavily weighted bythe above average costs which may be incurred by small establishments tocontrol worker exposure to wood dust. Per plant costs in SIC 24 are substantiallyhigher than those in the next highest industry, SIC 30, Rubber and Plastics.The $17,800 per plant costs in this industry result from above averagecompliance costs estimated for exposure control in molding and vulcanizingin large plants and crushing and grinding operations in small plants.Although small establishments, account for about 65.0 percent of the 101,200affected establishments, compliance costs for small establishments areexpected to account for roughly 44.9 percent of total industry compliancecosts.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Economic Impact, Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and EnvironmentalImpact Assessment</ITAG>Economic ImpactThe economic impacts discussed in this chapter have been estimated followingan analysis of data collected through a nationwide sample survey of over5,300 affected establishments. Two alternative polar assumptions were usedin this analysis.andbullet; <T3>Perfectly Elastic Demand or Zero Cost-Passthrough:</T3> All compliancecosts are absorbed by the firm in the form of reduced profits. This assumptionis the ``worst case'' scenario, where the maximum reduction in profitsto the firm (and industry) results.andbullet; <T3>Perfectly Inelastic Demand or Total Cost-Passthrough:</T3> All compliancecosts are passed on to the consumer sector in the form of higher prices.From the perspective of the firm, this is the ``best case'' scenario. Theresulting price increase would be the maximum theoretically possible.Two points should be noted. First, for the majority of industry sectors,neither assumed market structure would be accurate. In practice, the impactswill almost always produce a price increase smaller than the inelasticdemand projection and a reduction in profits smaller than that predictedunder perfectly elastic demand conditions. Second, increased firm productivitywould mitigate any adverse economic effects of the proposed standard. Productivityeffects would be related to reduced worker illness, absence and turnover.In addition, knowledge of improved workplace health conditions could resultin higher workforce morale and productivity . The firm would enjoy loweremployee training costs (due to the reduced turnover rate) and lower medicalbenefit and worker compensation claims. Overall productivity increaseswould be realized by firms that use a relatively fixed-factor productionprocess (i.e., low elasticities of substitution between labor and otherfactors of production). It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of theseproductivity and cost reducing effects. Any estimated economic costs ofcompliance would have to be adjusted downward to reflect these effects.Since data were not available to make any offset estimates, the economiceffects of the proposal identified in this chapter, are overstated.For this analysis, OSHA used a percentage reduction in profits approachto obtain estimates of the short-run economic impacts under the assumptionof perfect demand elasticity. These estimates were obtained by using thefollowing formula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,20,1,24</C> <H1>Percentage Reduction</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>New Profits_Old Profits</H1><H2>Old Profits,</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where New Profits=Old Profits_Compliance Costs, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Old Profits=(Return on Sales)*(Total Sales).</ITAG>These calculations were performed at the two-digit SIC level for firmsin large and small size-class stratifications (above and below 20 employees).The data used to obtain these estimates was based on Dun and Bradstreetcompany files [1;2].The potential impact on prices was used to estimate the market consequencesunder the second assumption of inelastic demand. This price increase wasestimated for each industry at the four-digit SIC level. Total sales valuesfor 1985 were used, the year for which the compliance costs were estimated.(Total sales represent the totality of production that leaves the establishment,whether it is sold to customers or sent to a parent company in a captivetransaction. For industries in the service and trade sectors, total salesdata were used. The rate of return percentage for each industry sectorcorrected and transformed gross sales data into more accurate and relevantindustry profit estimates.)For a given firm-size class, the potential price increase was estimatedby dividing the total estimated compliance costs for a firm by the salesof that firm. These estimated price effects were then compared to recentindustry price series. The intent of this comparison was to evaluate theimpact of the compliance cost-generated price increase in light of recentindustry price increase experience.In this scenario, the potential for international trade implications ofthe proposed standard was explored. It is anticipated that any internationaltrade effects will not be significant given the small value of domesticallyproduced goods and services which are exported (about seven percent ofGDP). Also, in recent months, the U.S. dollar has experienced a sharp declinein value relative to the yen and European currencies. Between February1985 and December 1987, the trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar fell46 percent [3]. This depreciation overwhelms any potential adverse internationaleconomic effect of the standard.In Table VII-1 and VII-2, the estimated domestic economic impacts are reportedfor the two polar methodologies. To derive the percentage change in profitsand the costs as a percent of sales, industry sales and rate of return(R.o.R.) on sales data were obtained from Dun and Bradstreet. The totalsales data are best estimates for industry sectors potentially impactedby the proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1219</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table VII-2._Economic Effects: Total-Cost Passthrough</T4><H1>SIC </H1><H1>Industry</H1><H1>Annual Costs (dollars millions)</H1><H1>Total Sales (dollars millions)</H1><H1>Costs as a percent of sales</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">20<D>Food prod</D><D>33.49</D><D>353,780.38</D><D>0.0095</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21<D>Tobacco</D><D>0.02</D><D>74,030.13</D><D>.0000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22<D>Text. mill </D><D>29.48</D><D>60,735.22</D><D>.0485</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">23<D>Apparel prod</D><D>31.74</D><D>74,474.65</D><D>.0426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24<D>Lumber andamp; wood </D><D>196.09</D><D>57,994.48</D><D>.3381</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25<D>Furniture </D><D>14.72</D><D>37,648.28</D><D>.0391</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26<D>Paper prod</D><D>31.26</D><D>103,694.14</D><D>.0301</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27<D>Printing andamp; pub</D><D>75.69</D><D>134,830.21</D><D>.0561</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28<D>Chemical prod</D><D>40.16</D><D>272,759.67</D><D>.0147</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29<D>Petro. refining</D><D>7.22</D><D>196,400.57</D><D>.0037</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30<D>Rubber andamp; plastics</D><D>75.48</D><D>86,538.58</D><D>.0872</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31<D>Leather products</D><D>2.58</D><D>15,449.56</D><D>.0167</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32<D>Stone andamp; clay</D><D>22.54</D><D>46,094.04</D><D>.0489</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33<D>Prim. metals</D><D>40.33</D><D>112,564.26</D><D>.0358</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">34<D>Fab. metals S</D><D>55.94</D><D>150,146.41</D><D>.0373</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35<D>Machinery </D><D>57.74</D><D>345,144.89</D><D>.0167</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">36<D>Elec. mach</D><D>31.78</D><D>245,982.70</D><D>.0129</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">37<D>Trans. equip</D><D>47.10</D><D>365,427.20</D><D>.0129</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">38<D>Instruments</D><D>13.46</D><D>83,359.57</D><D>.0162</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">39<D>Misc. manuf</D><D>18.20</D><D>41,870.30</D><D>.0435</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40<D>R.R. trans</D><D>.53</D><D>43,869.14</D><D>.0012</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">45<D>Air trans</D><D>1.83</D><D>109,538.08</D><D>.0017</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">47<D>Trans. services</D><D>1.85</D><D>12,254.96</D><D>.0151</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">49<D>Elec, gas andamp; san</D><D>22.69</D><D>300,254.83</D><D>.0076</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50<D>Wholesale trade \1\</D><D>4.05</D><D>13,853.52</D><D>.0293</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51<D>Wholesale, non-dur</D><D>8.86</D><D>113,848.20</D><D>.0078</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">55<D>Auto dealers</D><D>11.95</D><D>341,574.50</D><D>.0035</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">72<D>Personal services </D><D>31.29</D><D>24,270.74</D><D>.1289</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">73<D>Business service</D><D>8.95</D><D>22,165.94</D><D>.0404</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75<D>Auto repairs </D><D>1.51</D><D>45,750.92</D><D>.0033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">76<D>Misc. repair serv</D><D>4.85</D><D>2,665.52</D><D>.1819</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">80<D>Health services </D><D>4.44</D><D>170,234.25</D><D>.0026</D><F>Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F><F/><T4>Note._</T4>1.

The R.O.R. on saleswere obtained from summary statistics found in the Dun and Bradstreet IndustryNorms Database.<ITAG tagnum="81">Industry Effects </ITAG>The estmiated economic impact of the proposed rule from firms potentiallyaffected is summarized in Table VII-1. These estimates represent the maximumindustry impact within a market scenario where none of the costs can bepassed onto consumers, and there is no productivity offset to costs. Data in Table VII-1 indicate that the proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on profits in most industry sectors. The estimated average changein profits is less than one percent; this amount of profit reduction shouldnot represent a significant economic burden. The most adversely affected industry sector is SIC 24 with an estimated8 percent reduction in profits. The only other industry with an impactgreater than 2 percent is SIC 76, Miscellaneous Repair Services (2.7 percent).However, even in the worst case, OSHA believes the proposal is economicallyfeasible. In reality, the reduction in profits will be less because partof the costs will be passed on to consumers. Consumer effects were estimated using a ``full cost passthrough'' scenario.As demonstrated by the estimates summarized in Table VII-2, the impactson market prices will not be significant. No price increase would exceedone half of one percent. Changes of this magnitude are within general pricemovements recorded by producer price and other price indicies.Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisIn accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>)), OSHA has assessed the impact of the proposed rulemakingon large and small establishments. For this assessment, large establishmentsare defined as those with 20 or more employees and small establishmentsas those with 19 or fewer employees. The results of this assessment aresummarized in Table VII-3.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1223</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Industry sales and profit estimates were based on data from Dun and Bradstreetand the Department of Commerce 1982 Census of Manufacturers [5], Wholesalers[6], Retailers [7], and Services [8]. Sales and profit data for selectedtransportation sector industries (SIC 40, 45, 47, and 49) were not availablefor use in this preliminary assessment.The information summarized in Table VII-3 indicates that some small establishmentswill experience some adverse impact. The smaller profit margins of somesmall establishments make it difficult for them to absorb increases incompliance costs. In particular, small establishments in SIC 24 (Lumberand Wood), SIC 37 (Transportation Equipment Manufacturers), and SIC 30(Rubber and Plastics) show high potential changes in profits. Some of theseindustries are capital-intensive and the costs are not high in proportionto the capital invested. OSHA requests comments on approaches to reducethe impact on these establishments.It should be noted that these negative effects result in part from theextreme assumption of perfectly elastic demand. An important amelioratingfactor for each firm will be its ability to pass through additional coststo the consumer. The ability of individual firms to do this will be dependentupon product demand elasticities. It is expected that most impacted firmswill be able to pass through some portion of their increased costs.Environmental Impact AssessmentThis assessment has been prepared in accordance with provisions of theNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4325 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as well as the regulations of the Council on EnvironmentalQuality (40 CFR Part 1500), and DOL-NEPA Compliance Procedures (29 CFRPart 11).OSHA has reviewed the proposal and the information contained in the secondarydata bases as well as the information submitted by the contractors' industryexperts and has concluded that no significant environmental impacts arelikely to occur as a result of this action.Two environments may be affected by an OSHA regulatory action: (1) Theworkplace environment; and (2) the general human environment external tothe workplace, including impacts on air and water pollution, solid waste,energy, and land use. Usually OSHA regulations have their most significantimpacts on the workplace environment since this environment is under theAgency's jurisdiction. Lower and new PELs would benefit the workplace environmentbecause they would reduce worker exposure to toxic substances.In most cases, the effects of previous OSHA regulations on the externalenvironment have been negligible because of their limited scope and application.Similarly, there is no evidence to indicate that there would be any significantadverse impacts to the external environment as a result of this proposal.As with other OSHA regulations in the past, however, there may be a potentialbenefit to the environment, The potential benefits and other impacts arebriefly summarized here.<ITAG tagnum="81">Air Pollution</ITAG>Because of the nature of the emission standards of the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 61), many industry operations already use engineeringcontrols to reduce the amount of emissions to the atmosphere. This practiceis not expected to change as a result of the proposal. OSHA anticipatesthat controls already in place will continue to operate effectively inreducing emissions under the proposed revisions. Fourteen of the chemicalsaddressed in this proposal have been recognized by EPA as air pollutants.These are listed below:andbullet; Berylliumandbullet; Carbon Monoxideandbullet; Epichlorhydrinandbullet; Ethylene dichlorideandbullet; Hexachlorocyclopentadieneandbullet; Mercuryandbullet; Methyl chloroformandbullet; Nitrogen dioxideandbullet; Ozoneandbullet; Perchloroethyleneandbullet; Sulfur dioxideandbullet; Tolueneandbullet; Trichloroethylene<ITAG tagnum="81">Water Pollution</ITAG>EPA regulates over 100 of the chemicals addressed in this proposal underthe Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1251 <T3>et seq.</T3>). EPA's effluent limitation guidelines (40 CFR Part 427)include (1) standards of performance for all new point sources within specifiedcategories and (2) pretreatment standards for new plants discharging tomunicipal sewer systems. These limitations would serve to prevent the dischargeof effluents into the environment without prior treatment. Moreover, theFedral Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 required that wastewatereffluents be treated by the best practicable technology (BPT) by December31, 1977 and that the best available technology (BAT) economically achievablebe used by December 31, 1983. The EPA effluent limitations establish thedegree of effluent quality necessary to meet the BPT and BAT requirements.The BAT and pretreatment standards would essentially mean no dischargeof process wastewater to navigable waters and no discharge of incompatiblepollutants. These requirements will not change as the result of this proposaland where they continue to be met, effluent quality will not be altered.<ITAG tagnum="81">Solid Waste Disposal</ITAG>It does not appear that there would be any significant change in presentwaste disposal practices for over 80 chemicals addressed by this proposal,or in the maintenance of waste disposal sites. EPA's national emissionsstandards will continue to provide for the control and maintenance of activeand inactive disposals as well as require no visible emissions from thesesites.<ITAG tagnum="81">Energy and Land Use </ITAG>The implementation of required engineering controls could result in anincrease in total energy requirements or costs for general industry. Thiswould be particularly true where controls are not in place. Where generalexhaust ventilation is used, there is the expense of heating or coolingthe replacement air brought in from the outside. These costs, plus thecost of vacuuming, where necessary, have been included in the annual costsestimated in Chapter VI. In terms of land use, OSHA does not project anysignificant impact on land use plans, policies or controls. OSHA does notanticipate any significant impact on the short term uses of man's environmentor upon the maintenance of long-term productivity. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Impacts </ITAG>The proposal could also have other impacts that may affect the externalenvironment. The proposal could encourage the further use, research, anddevelopment of suitable substitutes for hazardous chemicals. This, in turn,would result in a positive environmental effect because fewer hazardouschemicals would be used, emitted to the air, discharged as wastewater effluent,or disposed of as solid waste. The magnitude or probability of these impacts,however, is impossible to quantify. Overall, the projected impacts of the proposed standard on the externalenvironment are not expected to be significant in view of EPA's regulationof air emissions, water effluents, and solid waste disposal methods. Summary Based on the data summarized in Tables VII-1 and VII-2 and historical information,OSHA has initially concluded that the economic impacts of the proposedrulemaking will not unduly burdensome for firms in the industries potentiallyaffected. However, some industry sub-sectors may experience an adverseeconomic impact. In addition, the estimates indicate that some small establishmentsin SICs 24, 30, and 37 may experience a greater impact than larger entities.OSHA requests comments on approaches to reduce the impact on those smallestablishments. It should be emphasized that these estimates are preliminary.The proposed rule is not expected to have an adverse effect on the environment.<ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Introduction This appendix contains a description of the statistical methodology employedto design and implement the PEL survey. The following topics will be discussed:andbullet; Survey objectives; andbullet; Sampling frame selection; andbullet; Stratification; andbullet; Sample size determination; andbullet; Estimation procedures; andbullet; Data collection method; andbullet; Variance estimation; andbullet; Treatment of non-sampling errors; and andbullet; Survey treatment. Survey Objectives Surveys are frequently designed to produce a set of estimates at a predefinedlevel of accuracy. This requires defining the set of quantities to be estimatedand specifying their levels of accuracy. Since many variables may ultimatelybe estimated from the survey, and since no single design can be optimalfor all estimates simultaneously, it is customary to define the most importantvariables for estimation. For this survey, the following variables wereidentified as those motivating the survey design: andbullet; Cost to industry of the proposed set of new permissible exposurelimits (as a group); andbullet; Number of workers potentially exposed to toxic substances; andandbullet; Number of workers affected by the proposed regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Statistical theory dictates that responses be concentrated both ingroups which have the highest variability with respect to these variablesand in groups representing the majority of establishments in the population.No hard information relating to the variability of the variables mentionedabove by industry sector or other relevant breakdown was available at theoutset of the survey. Hence, the variability in the number of employeeswas used as a variability measure. Consistent with the notion that thevariability of numbers exposed as well as the variability of cost requiredto remedy an overexposure are highest in the largest companies, the samplewas designed to include a higher proportion of larger establishments. The sample was drawn so as to insure that the coefficient of variationof estimates (the ratio of the sample standard error to the mean) was withinpredetermined bounds. The coefficient of variation is a measure of theaccuracy of each estimate. A coefficient of variation of 5 percent meansthat the standard error of the estimate is equal to 5 percent of that estimate.This can be interpreted as saying that the estimate is within two standarderrors or 10 percent of the true value with 95 percent probability. Sincerisks were judged to be different in different sectors, OSHA selected a5 percent coefficient of variation in the industries using the most chemicals,7.5 percent in industries with moderate use of chemicals and 10 percentin the service sectors. A table of design specifications in included inSection 5 below. 3. Sampling Frame Selection The Dun and Bradstreet (Dandamp;B) listing was chosen for the PEL surveysampling frame (a listing of establishments from which sample units areselected). This is a nationally based list, containing establishment namesas well as each establishment's address, telephone number, SIC code, andnumber of employees. The Dun and Bradstreet database is regularly refined(every six months) thus minimizing the probability of obtaining out ofbusiness or out of scope (e.g., wrong SIC code) establishments when usingthe frame. The Dandamp;B is a commercial listing and its use does not violateany confidentially requirement associated with other frames available toparticular agencies in the government. 4. Stratification Thirty-four groupings of industries (estimation cells) were chosen to beexamined for the PEL study. The cell definitions were determined by groupingtogether industry sectors defined by Standard Industrial Classifications(SICs) which share similar processes and procedures. The cell definitionsused for the PEL survey are given in TABLE 1-1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1-1._Definitions of Estimation Cells</T4><H1>Cell No.</H1><H1>SIC codes included </H1><H1>Description</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> 1<D>243</D><D>Millwork, Veneer, Plywood.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 2<D>245</D><D>Wood Bldgs andamp; Mobile Homes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 3<D>249</D><D>Misc.

This procedure wasaccomplished by first selecting one case at random in the size class forthe first K units on the frame_where K is the reciprocal of the samplingfraction_and then selecting every Kth unit in the stratum thereafter. Note,from the size class definitions that establishments having zero employeeswere not included in the survey. Such units were assumed to be out of thescope of the survey.5. Sample Size Determination and Allocation Within StrataThe total number of establishments selected from the Dun and Bradstreetsampling frame was determined using two stages. The first stage was tocompute the target number of respondents for each estimation cell usingthe standard sample size formula. The formula requires the specificationof a target coefficient of variation for estimates.The coefficients of variation for this survey were set at the followinglevels:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,9.1</C> <H1>SIC's</H1><H1>Coefficient of Variation (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">24 through 29<D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 through 39<D>7.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40 through 80<D>10</D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The units were then allocated to size classes within the estimationcells using Neyman allocation. This method allocates based on the numberof establishments in each stratum and on the stratum variability in thekey design variable (in this case employment). Size class strata havinga large number of establishments on the frame or a high variability inemployment (as defined by the population variance) received a greater numberof sample units than other strata in the sample. Because the larger sizeclasses often have a high variability in employment, this allocation resultedin ``oversampling'' the larger size classes in a cell. The required numberof cases for each stratum are shown in TABLE 1-2 in the column labeled``Target Number of Respondents.''The number of units actually selected from the Dandamp;B frame in each stratumwas based on the number of completed cases required for the stratum andon the expected response rate. Almost all sample surveys, especially voluntarysurveys, select some number of cases which do not result in a completedinterview. In some instances, these will be establishments which have goneout of business, are duplicate cases, or are companies not in the SIC categoryshown on the frame. Such cases are ``Out of Scope''. Other establishments,though in scope, refuse to participate or are not reached in the samplingprotocol, defined here as a total of five telephone attempts. Experienceof surveys similar to the PEL survey indicated that a completion ratioof 50-60% was expected for this survey (the ratio of completed questionnairesto total cases which must be drawn_both in and out of scope). However,to be safe, a larger number of cases were selected and held in reservefrom the Dandamp;B frame so that, if additional sample units needed to beincluded to reach the target sample sizes, the cases could be easily obtained.In fact, for the vast majority of cells, a 60 percent completion ratiowas realized. The total number of establishments called in each of thesample strata are shown in TABLE 1-2 in the column labeled ``Total CasesCalled.'' In general, this number is equal to the target sample dividedby 0.60. The number of completed responses as of May 2, 1988 is shown inTABLE 1-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-2-M005</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 1238-1242</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-2-C</ITAG>6. Data Collection MethodologyThe data collection method chosen for the survey was Computer AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI). In this method the interviewer talks tothe respondent on the telephone while sitting in front of a computer screen.Each question to be asked appears on the screen in the proper sequence.CATI systems allow for the responses to be examined during the data collectionprocess. Answers that are out of the possible range of responses or whichare not consistent with other answers received earlier in the questionnairecan be immediately identified. Another advantage is that it frees the interviewerup from using a hard copy questionnaire which requires skipping manuallyto different parts of the questionnaire based upon the responses. Finally,this method saves resources by creating a machine readable record of theresponses at the conclusion of the interview, thereby eliminating the needfor keypunching.7. Estimation ProceduresCost estimates for the PEL study take the form of a combined ratio estimatorand can be expressed in the following manner:<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="94">insert illus 21243This estimator benchmarks the estimate obtained from the Dun and Bradstreetsample to Bureau of Labor Statistics ES-202 employment counts for eachcell. The benchmarking helps to correct for any deficiencies in the Dandamp;Bsampling frame. Such a procedure is particularly important in the non-manufacturingindustries where establishments are frequently under-represented on theDandamp;B sampling frame.8. Variance EstimationAs with any sample survey, quantification of sampling error of estimatesis an important function. Errors are quantified by computing the standarderror of each estimate produced from the survey. Under certain assumptions,the standard error can be used to make probability statements about estimates.For example, an interval equal to two standard errors on either side ofan estimate is a 95 percent confidence interval. This means that one canbe 95 percent sure that the true value of the quantity being estimatedlies somewhere inside that interval.A replication technique will be used to determine standard errors for thePEL survey. For this method one resamples the original data multiple timesto compute standard errors. A replication method was chosen because oftwo characteristics of the survey. First, some of the estimates which areplanned to be produced are nonlinear such as ratio estimates. Second, weare using a nonresponse adjustment factor to adjust the final weights.In both of these situations, replication-type variance estimators are particularlyuseful.9. Treatment of Non-Sampling ErrorsAn important component to any survey effort is the treatment of nonsamplingerrors. Examples of such errors are:andbullet; Nonresponse bias_error introduced because some selected respondentseither do not respond at all (unit nonresponse) or do not respond to aparticular question (item nonresponse);andbullet; Response bias_error introduced due the way questions are phrasedor the way respondents interpret what is being asked (this also includeserror due to deliberate misrepresentation of the answers to questions byrespondents).<ITAG tagnum="10">In the PEL survey, the nonresponse problem was dealt with using twostandard methodologies. For unit nonresponse, a mean imputation procedurewas used. This procedure assumes that there is no fundamental differencebetween respondents and nonrespondents and, therefore, usable cases canbe reweighted to represent the entire universe. For item nonresponse, animputation scheme which uses related cases in the respondent group to estimatethe missing data was used.The situation for response bias will be handled by obtaining informationfrom site visits. OSHA will conduct 100 site visits in a cross sectionof industries. A large portion of these visits will be done on establishmentswhich were also in the telephone survey. Data on key variables collectedduring the telephone survey will be compared with information obtainedfrom the site visits. This analysis must be undertaken when site visitshave been completed.9.1. Unit Nonresponse AdjustmentIn order to adjust the sample for those cases selected from the Dandamp;Bframe which where called but were out of scope (OOS), out of business (OOB),or in scope but unwilling to participate in the survey, the following approachwas used.andbullet; All solicited sample units were assigned a response code basedon the following categories:<ITAG tagnum="15">03 Non-working telephone number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">04 Incorrect SIC_out of scope</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">05 Out of Business (OOB)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">06 Not a business or wrong business</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">07 Duplicate record</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">08 Could not reach respondent after five attempts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">09 Communication barrier</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10 Initial refusal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">11 Mid-interview refusal (did not answer initial chemical and processquestions)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">12 Completed interview (completed both initial chemical and processquestions)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">13 Other nonresponse.</ITAG>andbullet; All units having a response code equal to 08, 09, 10, 11, 12,or 13 were classified as viable sample units (in scope, in business). Sampleunits having a response code equal to 12 were classified as both viableand usable. Two nonresponse adjustment weights were assigned to each usablerecord in the database, based on the ratio of viable to usable sample unitsin the record's cell and size stratum:<G/></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="94">insert illus 2 1246<ITAG tagnum="10">As of May 2, 1988 the response rate experience was as follows:<ITAG tagnum="14">Response rate=73.2%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Completion rate=61.5%</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The response rate is defined as the number of usable cases dividedby the number of viable cases. The completion rate is defined as the numberof usable cases divided by the total number of cases contacted.9.2 Item Nonresponse Adjustment/ImputationOften survey respondents do not know the answers to some questions or refuseto answer particular questions. In such cases, it is possible to fill inmissing values using an imputation scheme. The idea is to use informationfrom both the respondent (answers to other questions which they did supply)and information from other respondents (those answering the missing question)in order to estimate a reasonable response to the missing datum.The imputation method chosen for the PEL survey is a hybrid method whichcombines the concepts of a mean imputation and a ``hot-deck'' imputation.A mean imputation method replaces the missing values on a certain questionwith the mean value from those respondents answering that question. A hotdeck method attempts to find a respondent who matches the respondent havinga missing value (in terms of other survey characteristics) and uses thevalue of the ``twin'' to replace the missing value. The method used hereis a hybrid in the sense that it employs a mean imputation, but only overa small segment of the population which obviously matches the respondenthaving a missing value.In particular, the procedure examines three or four digit SIC subgroupswithin the estimation cell by size class. The mean values of the responsesto a particular question of interest in such sample subgroupings were usedto impute the missing values in that grouping. In the case of categoricalvariables (for example, YES/NO questions), a randomization scheme was usedwhich randomly supplied the appropriate set of responses to missing questionsbased on a probability distribution determined from those who responded.It should be noted that the values which were placed on the database werenot intended to be estimates of the missing reponses. Rather, they aremeant to be substitute responses which allow the case to be used in thegeneration of survey estimates. In the aggregate, estimates produced usingimputed data make sense, but may not for the individual establishment.Care was taken in the imputation program to be sure that imputed responseswere consistent with other answers for the establishment of interest. Originalresponses to all questions were retained on the sample record and all responsesrepresenting imputed values were identified. One set of questions whichwas not imputed for was whether monitoring for the presence of certaintoxic chemicals was done at the establishment. The data collected as ofMay 2, 1988 produced an estimate, for those establishments where chemicalsor processes were found, that 14.5 percent did monitoring, 65.7 percentdid not do monitoring, and 19.8 percent of respondents did not know orrefused to answer the question. Of those establishments that did monitor,25.6 percent provided the requested data.10.
