Michael Dukakis, the hard times didn't endwith his defeat in the presidential election.   The severe state budget problems that haunted the final stages ofhis campaign have hurt his support. Political allies have startedattacking him over the deficit and his decision that more taxes werethe only way to balance the books.   Meanwhile, fatigue and depression associated with thepresidential campaign defeat led to his wife Kitty entering analcohol treatment program.   And a recent public opinion poll found him about as popular as aswim in polluted Boston Harbor.   ``I don't believe I can remember a Massachusetts governor whowent from that high to such a relatively low period in such a shortperiod of time,'' said John Volpe, a former Republican governor.``You can go downhill as fast as you can go uphill.''   Most of Dukakis' friends maintain that his stoicism is seeing himthrough.   ``I don't see a Mike Dukakis who is worn down or torn down bythese events,'' said Boston attorney Paul Brountas, chairman ofDukakis' presidential campaign and a personal friend.   If Dukakis occasionally seemed distracted, it was because ``thefamily is obviously the most important consideration,'' Brountassaid. ``I don't think it's easily compartmentalized.''   These should have been his golden years culminating more than adecade in the state's highest office. Instead, since becoming a lameduck by announcing in January that he won't run for governor again,Dukakis has wrestled with some of the biggest problems to face stategovernment in years.   And he is doing it without the usual support.   On Sunday, a week after Kitty Dukakis entered a Rhode Islandcenter to be treated for an alcohol problem, headlines announcedthat, for the first time in his statewide political career, Dukakis'favorability rating had dipped below 50 percent. The poll of 603Democrats and independents by Secretary of State Michael Connollyshowed only 43.5 percent rating the governor favorably.   On Monday, Dukakis went before the state House Taxation Committeeto defend a $735 million tax increase proposal. He says he needs themoney to help close a $600 million budget gap this year and keepnext year's budget in balance.   All this for a politician who, in 1986, won re-election by betterthan a 2-1 margin, who gained the Democratic presidential nominationafter winning primaries in every region of the country and who asrecently as December had a favorable rating among Democrats of 83percent.   Since the presidential election, Dukakis has occasionally shownmore fire than he did on the campaign trail. In hisstate-of-the-state address, for example, he called his opponents onfiscal issues ``gutless wonders.'' And on Monday, he was moreaggressive than usual at a state budget hearing, blastinglegislators as free spenders yet tax foes.   Brountas said that Dukakis is, if anything, in a better positionto handle his current political troubles than he was on thepresidential campaign trail. Amid the attacks by Bush on suchsubjects as furloughs for prisoners and the unclean waters of BostonHarbor, Dukakis was unable to get his message through.   In Massachusetts, Brountas said, ``this is different. This iswhere he is at his best in terms of controlling the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
