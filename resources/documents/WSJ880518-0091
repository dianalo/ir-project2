Clark Jr. and Alfred L. Malabre Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO EMI FIN </IN><TEXT>   The economy is getting a lot of good press this week. The trade deficit plunged, industrial production jumped and America's factories are busier than at any time since the late 1970s.    Yet to many people, something just doesn't feel right. The stock and bond markets are acting as if they just got bad news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 21 points yesterday, and bond prices also dropped. Many economic forecasters are growing more, not less, worried over the economic outlook.    What's wrong?    For the short term -- the next few months -- probably nothing. The concern is over what the new signs of economic vigor may be signaling about inflation and interest rates down the road.    Sharp increases in prices and interest rates could set the stage for a new recession. And higher prices and rates are precisely what the narrowing trade deficit and booming factory production portend.    The March trade deficit was the lowest in three years, but what spooked everyone is that the improvement came from a 23% surge in merchandise exports, not any decline in imports. Though exports have been up for a while, that kind of demand is starting to push industrial production hard. Output is already running 6.4% ahead of last year, and America's factories are starting to strain. They operated at 83% of capacity last month, the highest rate since November 1979.    &quot;The export surge explains a sharp rise in industrial production in April,&quot; says Morris Cohen, a Hackensack, N.J., economic consultant. &quot;Everything is falling into place for a strong economy, and that means the Fed will keep tightening monetary policy to head off inflation.&quot;    That's exactly what Fed officials must do, argues economist and former Fed governor Lyle Gramley. &quot;It would be unwise if they didn't,&quot; he says after looking at the latest figures. &quot;No one expects a recession&quot; imminently. The bigger fear, he says, is an overheated economy -- a marked turnaround from the dire scenarios propounded for early 1988 by some economists after last October's stock-market crash.    Not everyone foresees higher interest rates, of course. Some anticipate a more sluggish business pace, which would damp down inflation and the pressures for higher rates. An analysis by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. concludes that the cost of credit is probably in a &quot;peaking process that should give way to much lower rates by midsummer.&quot;    And any interest-rate forecast entails huge imponderables, ranging from the behavior of the Federal Reserve Board in a presidential election year -- all members are Reagan appointees -- to the timing of the next recession.    Still, most economists believe that business activity will keep expanding through 1988. And what worries them is that interest rates were already increasing even before the latest economic news.    Norman Robertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank, credits recent Fed tightening for probably averting a sharper buildup in inflation and sharper rate increases later that could precipitate a recession. He anticipates both a moderate interest-rate climb and moderate growth the rest of the year. But &quot;with this new upswing in interest rates, the economy's long upward march becomes trickier,&quot; Mr. Robertson adds. &quot;The future for some sectors, particularly for housing and commercial real estate, has already grown dimmer.&quot;    Many other analysts believe that the latest rise in rates may mark the start of a severe, sustained climb that will end only after a new recession has set in, perhaps in early 1989. In general, the view is that the sharper the climb in rates in coming months, the sooner the next recession.    Economists at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. foresee progressively higher rates until early next year, at which point a recession is expected to arrive, followed by a new decline in interest rates. At the Treasury's quarterly refunding last week, 30-year Treasury bonds were priced to yield 9.17%, the highest such auction yield since early 1986. Merrill Lynch analysts look for the yield on such issues to reach 9.5% by summer and 10% by year's end.    Roy E. Moor, an economic consultant for the investment firm of McKinley Allsopp Inc., agrees that a recession is on the way, with &quot;the probabilities infinitely high in favor&quot; of its arrival within the next eight to 12 months.    With the sharp rise in rates that he expects, it could well prove &quot;a very severe recession,&quot; he adds. He lays out a rising-rate scenario in which housing will be &quot;the first sector hit.&quot; The next to be hurt, he predicts, will be new-car sales, which rose strongly in early May, and finally -- &quot;at the time the next recession arrives&quot; -- capital spending.    Such judgments partly reflect an appreciation of business-cycle patterns. Interest rates usually rise more and more sharply as expansion phases of the business cycle grow old. The current expansion, in its 66th month, has already endured about twice as long as the average cyclical upturn and is, in fact, the longest peacetime upswing in U.S. history.    The accompanying table, covering the past three decades and five recessions, pinpoints the tendency of interest rates to begin rising long before recessions arrive. The low points for interest rates are based on monthly average yields of high-grade corporate bonds, supplied by the Commerce Department. The starts of the recessions are supplied by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass.    Normally, a rate rise before a recession is erratic, with the sharpest increases occurring relatively close to the recession's start. Most of the rate climb before December 1969, for instance, occurred in the preceding couple of years, even though rates had been edging up for some five years before that.    In the current expansion, the low point for the interest-rate measure was in February 1987. Since then, the rate measure has been as high as 10.80%, in October 1987, and as low as 9.43%, in February of this year. Increasing very recently, it yesterday was a little above 10%.    Other factors that could keep rates rising, says Robert M. Giordano, economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., range from the likelihood of worsening inflation to further &quot;downward pressure on the dollar.&quot; He adds, referring to the persistence of red ink in the foreign-trade sector, that an &quot;essential cause of rising rates has not been eliminated.&quot;    If the improvement exhibited in the March figures continues, however, it should tend to strengthen the dollar and thus reduce any need for the Fed to prop up the currency through still higher rates. But as Mr. Cohen, the Hackensack economist, explains, a trade deficit narrowing because of demand for U.S. exports puts upward pressure on prices and ultimately on interest rates.    Whatever develops on the trade front, many economists cite remarkably strong demand for domestic credit in recent weeks as a major force tending -- quite apart from any Fed policies -- to push up rates.    William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., says that &quot;short-term business credit demands exploded last month,&quot; and have contributed &quot;in a major way to the recent uptrend in money-market rates.&quot; He adds that &quot;over the last three months, short-term business credit demands have surged by an incredible $35.1 billion, or at a 22.7% annual rate.&quot;    Early signs of possible economic trouble from the rate climb show up in a recent survey of consumer confidence by the Conference Board. While the nonprofit group's &quot;confidence index&quot; rose last month, the fine print of the report shows a marked decline in the share of households planning to buy a home, new or lived-in, over the next six months. Home-buying plans, the survey notes, are &quot;strongly influenced by swings in interest rates.&quot; The report also shows declines, though relatively shallow ones, in the shares of households intending to buy cars or take vacation trips.    The threat of higher rates appears thus far to have had little actual effect on people's businesses, though concern clearly is on the rise.    &quot;If rates keep going up, it will begin to dry up demand,&quot; says Paul Balderston, a general contractor in New Hope, Pa., who is also a director of First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Bucks County. And Tom Lindeman, a Westfield, N.J., Buick dealer, worries that &quot;if rates continue to increase, we'll probably lose some of our credit customers.&quot; Up to now, however, &quot;business has been fine,&quot; he says.    Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at the investment firm of CMandamp;M Group Inc., worries that higher rates could also serve to deepen the already profound federal budget deficit. &quot;Interest on the public debt increased by 7.3% in the first half of this fiscal year,&quot; he notes, adding that &quot;recent increases in interest rates should raise this cost&quot; further in coming months. Partly as a result, he expects the deficit for the full fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, to reach $170 billion, some $20 billion higher than in fiscal 1987.    A sustained rise in rates, some analysts figure, could also cause difficulty for the stock market. A study in the Bank Credit Analyst, a monthly economic report, predicts that high interest rates will trigger &quot;a testing of the October-December (stockmarket) lows,&quot; probably later this year.    One thing on which analysts agree is that U.S. authorities have less control over rates nowadays than years ago, before the succession of huge budget and trade deficits.    &quot;The Fed's control over interest rates has been reduced dramatically by the need to finance enormous federal deficits and by the increasing financing of these deficits from overseas sources,&quot; says Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist of WEFA Group, an economic consulting concern.    ---                  How Rates Lead Recessions           INTEREST        RECESSION'S     LEAD           RATE LOW         START          TIME           June 1958       April 1960      22 months           Jan. 1963       Dec. 1969       83 months           Jan. 1972       Nov. 1973       22 months           Jan. 1977       Jan. 1980       36 months           June 1980       July 1981       13 months</TEXT></DOC>
