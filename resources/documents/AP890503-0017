ROWE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Student protests from Massachusetts to California took aimTuesday at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases and unionrecognition, and student pressure at a prestigious college led to aban on Coca-Cola products.   In New York, thousands of protesting City University studentsskipped classes and marched through lower Manhattan as a deadlineapproached on a state spending bill that would reduce money forhigher education and force a tuition increase. Hours later, Gov.Mario Cuomo vetoed the tuition hike.   In South Hadley, Mass., Mount Holyoke College administrators,under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products becauseof the company's ties to South Africa, announced a monthlong ban ofthe company's soft drinks.   In the central Massachusetts town of Granby, nearly 400 studentswalked out of high school and into a heavy rain to protest budgetcuts the principal says could cost the school at least threeteachers and several programs.   In Atlanta, students and others who met to discuss a decision toban a rap music concert Friday at Morris Brown College werereleased without bond Tuesday after a hearing on felony trespassingcharges.   Twenty-seven people, including students from several AtlantaUniversity Center colleges and some non-students, were arrestedMonday for refusing to leave a student center, said Cynthia Bell, aMorris Brown College spokeswoman.   At the University of California at Berkeley, teaching andresearch assistants on Wednesday were to begin a two-day walkoutand picket the four major campus entrances to protest the school'srefusal to recognize their union.   In New York, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that beganlast week.   Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university systemassembled in front of the World Trade Center, where Cuomo's NewYork office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours,then paraded through the streets past City Hall to the Wall Streetfinancial district.   ``It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let themgo, it will be more,'' said Armando Howard, a 29-year-old physicsstudent at Hunter College. ``It will cut out the opportunity forpeople to rise.''   Cuomo, who had until midnight to sign or veto the tuitionincrease measure, had given no indication what his decision wouldbe. But one hour before the deadline, it was announced he hadvetoed the legislation, saying university officials hadn't proventhe need for the extra money.   At Mount Holyoke, officials outlined immediate steps to replaceCoke USA products with beverages from companies with little or nobusiness interest in South Africa. The announcement came in aone-page release that gave no explanation for the move.   Students at Mount Holyoke and several other colleges in westernMassachusetts have pressed administrators for two months to removeCoca-Cola products because, they say, the company is reapingprofits that benefit racially segregated South Africa.   ``I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows someresponsibility on the part of the adminstration in terms oflistening to students,'' said Kuhusu Wanzu, a member of the CokeCampaign at the American Friends Service Committee in Atlanta,which organized the campus boycotts.   In Granby, students who comprise virtually the entire populationof the little school stood for 45 minutes in heavy rain beforereturning to class, said Principal John Cullinan.   ``The students felt this was the only way they could get theirmessage across in a way that people would notice,'' the principalof the Granby Junior-Senior High said.   At Berkeley, neither the 3,200-member Association of GraduateStudent Employees nor university officials would predict how manyassistants would join the walkout.   ``So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolicthan a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman TomDebley.   The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants'work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwinedwith educational experience, said Debley. Assistants receive annualstipends from the university or research institutions averagingabout $10,000.   The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as aunion, but the Public Employement Relations Board recently ruledstudents do not have to be considered employees for the purposes ofcollective bargaining. The association is appealing the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
