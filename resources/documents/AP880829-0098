About 500 people were injured, including dozens who werecritically burned by jet fuel, in the accident Sunday at RamsteinU.S. Air Base. Eleven Americans were in critical condition at aU.S. Army hospital in Landstuhl, said Ramstein spokesman Sgt. EddieLee.   Bodies were charred and clothes burned off victims in whatappeared to be the world's worst air show tragedy involvingspectators. Many of the dead were children.   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz quickly canceled a military airshow scheduled for September, and today annnounced that Bonnofficials and their NATO allies were suspending any further showsin West Germany.   More than 300,000 people, most of them Americans and WestGermans, were watching as the Italian air force team's 10 jets,flying about 180 feet off the ground, intersected over the fieldfrom three directions.   Two planes plunged to the ground and a third careened in flamesinto the crowd, setting off an inferno more than 100 feet high and100 feet wide. Terrified spectators ran for their lives as theflames scorched scores of people and destroyed buses, trucks andcars.   ``Some were missing skin on their arms,'' said DeeDee ArringtonDoke, a reporter for the unofficial U.S. military newspaper Starsand Stripes.``A lot had black burns.''   She said that after the crash ``people started crying andscreaming. The ones who were stopped were hugging each other andcrying like they were saying `What are we going to do?' The oneswho were running were screaming.''   AFN, the U.S. military radio network, today quoted Americanofficials as saying at least 46 people were killed _ including thepilots of the three Italian planes _ and 500 injured at the base 60miles southwest of Frankfurt.   Authorities issued no list of dead or injured and saididentification of victims would be a lengthy process becaused manypeople were badly burned. The nationalities of the dead were notknown.   ``They've been working throughout the night to identify thebodies. Then the next of kin must be notified,'' Lee said. He saidhe did not expect to have a casualty list until Tuesday.   Rudolf Tartter, head of the local West German governmentdistrict that includes Ramstein, said 45 people were killed. Therewas no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.   ``Of those injured, 345 are seriously injured,'' Tartter said.   ``There are many children among the dead and injured,'' saidKris Kumpf, a medical assistant who treated some victims. ``And theworst part of it is, we're still trying to find some of theparents,'' she told reporters.   A five-member medical team from the Brooke Army Medical Centerin San Antonio, Texas, flew to West Germany today to help treatburn victims.   Lt. Hans-Juergen Vollmer, spokesman for the local governmentdistrict, said he believed the accident was caused by pilot error.He did not elaborate.   Demonstrators opposed to air shows because of the risk ofaccidents rallied outside Ramstein as Sunday's show began. Afterthe crash, some federal and local officials to demand an end to theorchestrated aerial stunts.   In Rome today, the Italian Defense Ministry said the Italianstunt team involved in the disaster will continue to perform thisyear but will limit its activities to simple fly-overs. ``Futureactivity will be scheduled according to measures taken to safeguardthe safety of the spectators,'' a ministry statement said.   On Sunday, a Finnish military training aircraft crashed at aBelgian air base about 70 miles northeast of Brussels, killing thepilot, police said.   Scholz said in a statement today that officials will study waysfor West Germany and its NATO allies to demonstrate their airforces' abilities to the public without endangering civilians.   ``Until suggestions for effective measures are complete, therewill not be any more air shows with military aircraft in WestGermany, this with the agreement of the air forces of our NATOallies,'' Scholz announced.   He also said he was banning West German military aircraft fromdoing stunts like the one that led to Sunday's disaster.   ``The events at Ramstein confirm in a really horrible way howdangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers,'' saidWalter Kolbow, a federal lawmaker for the opposition SocialDemocratic Party.   Members of the Greens Party called for Scholz's resignation.   At least seven aircraft accidents have occurred involving NATOequipment this year in West Germany. One occurred at a Hanover airshow on May 7, when a British military helicopter's rotor bladesstruck a loading ramp. Two British airmen were killed and 12spectators injured.   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Sunday's disaster was theworst air show tragedy in terms of spectator deaths. Thirty peopledied when a jet crashed into a crowd in 1952 at Farnborough,England, the BBC said. Forty-six people, most of them U.S. Armyparachutists, died in a helicopter crash at a 1982 air show inMannheim.</TEXT></DOC>
