Guards protected government buildings in Rangoon over theweekend, following protests Friday in which demonstrators wreckedcars, set fire to a department store and chanted anti-governmentslogans.   Some Rangoon residents said there were casualties and massarrests by security forces, but the government-controlled newsmedia was virtually silent on the disturbances.   Open protests have been rare in Burma since President Ne Winseized power in 1962 and instituted one-party rule.   But over the past two years, small demonstrations and outburstsof violence have occurred in reaction to worsening economicconditions.   Last September, hundreds of students in Rangoon rioted toprotest a government decision to invalidate three denominations ofbanknotes.   Friday's demonstrations began in support of students at theRangoon Institute of Technology, who had rioted March 12.   One student, Maung Phone Maw, 23, was shot March 12 and thegovernment panel was set up to investigate his death.   The rioting began after students clashed with local residentsover whether to play a cassette tape in a tea shop, and police thenmoved in firing tear gas and making arrests.</TEXT></DOC>
