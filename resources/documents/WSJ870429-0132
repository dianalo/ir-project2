Combustion's agreement with FPL Group Inc. represents a significant step in a growing cooperation between electric utilities and cogeneration developers, formerly ardent competitors. Stamford, Conn.-based Combustion is one company, however, that has had a relationship with the utility industry in the past, designing and building large power plants.    Cogeneration produces both electricity and steam heat simultaneously from a single fuel source, such as natural gas or garbage. It is catching on in many areas of the U.S., partly because of favorable federal regulations and a growing shortage of urban landfill capacity.    Because traditional utility plants usually are much bigger and costlier than cogeneration facilities, they can represent an unwarranted or premature investment in new generating capacity. Moreover, traditional power plants are less cost-effective in that they aren't able to retrieve the steam produced in making electricity.    Many utilities, of course, still are fighting any attempt by independent power producers to enter their service territories. But some are starting to cooperate because they believe that, by the early 1990s, they may be short of generating capacity and in need of partners who can lessen the financial risk of building new power plants.    Earlier this month, Atlantic City Electric Co., citing a desire to avoid building &quot;costly&quot; new plants, announced a joint venture with a Lyndhurst, N.J.-based cogeneration developer, Morris-Rospond Group, to develop, own and operate cogeneration plants throughout the U.S. The utility predicted it would have a &quot;significant number&quot; of such facilities in operation within five years.    Combustion said that in addition to cogeneration plants, the joint venture company, to be called Power Ventures, will develop hydroelectric facilities. A spokesman said negotiations already are under way for some small-scale cogeneration projects.    The new venture could pose competition for Atlanta-based Southern Co.'s new cogeneration-development unit. Southern, a utility holding company, views its cogeneration unit as a means of keeping large industrial and commercial customers from leaving Southern's system to generate their own power. Now the company may have a harder time persuading customers to stay in the fold. </TEXT></DOC>
