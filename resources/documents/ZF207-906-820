(products).andO;Product:   Touchbase WorldPort 2400 (Modem).andO;Topic:     ModemsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Top-Flight PortableandM;TOUCHBASE SYSTEMS INC., WORLDPORTandM;2400, $359 (INCLUDES MERIDIANandM;TECHNOLOGY INC.'S CARBON COPYandM;PLUS COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE)andM;The WorldPort, which measures 4 inches by 2-2/5 inches, is a solid performer.andO;Incorporating a 9-volt battery, it is extremely portable, although it canalso be connected to a wall outlet.andP;  Touchbase officials estimate that asingle battery can support up to six hours of communications.andM;The WorldPort switches on and off based on whether the computer it isattached to is being used or not.andM;Unlike GVC-Chenel's MM-24, the WorldPort 2400 does not have a power on/offswitch, so users have to be careful with their configurations.andP;  Its internalswitches are set to turn power on either when the DTR signal from the RS-232Ccable connecting it to the computer tells the modem the computer is ready tocommunicate or when the Receive Transmission (RX) is on.andM;In many cases, this means the modem will turn on when the computer powers up,and will stay on until the computer is turned off.andM;To save battery power, Touchbase recommends the use of the RX only when usingcommunications software that does not support the DTR feature.andM;The WorldPort 2400 supports overseas as well as domestic dialing features.andO;There is a slight price to pay, however: When changing its internal switches,users must dismantle the modem to gain access to them.andM;The WorldPort 2400 is the only product among those tested to include anacoustic-coupler interface.andP;  This is useful when the users are traveling inforeign countries or in domestic areas where a modular phone jack isunavailable.andM;Touchbase has made good use of the optional fields in the AT command set byplacing a lot of information in the AT-information (ATI) registers.andM;Users who want to get a brief summary of the AT command set and other helpfuloperating information can simply type &quot;ATI.&quot;andM;This modem offers slightly different indicator lights than those found onGVC-Chenel's MM-24.andP;  The WorldPort 2400 includes indicators for low batterypower, high speed, carrier detect and call progress (which indicates if datais being received or transmitted).andM;Touchbase Systems Inc. can be reached in Northport, N.Y., at (516) 261-0423.andM;----------Buyers say: Meets our needsandM;Buyers said the WorldPort 2400 is reliable, flexible and easy to use.andM;&quot;I bought [WorldPort 2400] for its ease of use, reliability and price -- inthat order,&quot; said Walter O'Shea, manager of international systems for TheAssociated Press in New York.andM;O'Shea lauded the modem for its reliability.andP;  &quot;I have probably 20 [WorldPort2400s] in service, and I've had only one returned for repair,&quot; he said.andM;Scott Kreisler, manager of scientific information at Chesebrough-Ponds, amanufacturer of personal-care products in Trumbull, Conn., needed a modemthat was easy for his less experienced users to operate.andM;Although Kreisler has also purchased internal modems for laptops, he's stillusing the WorldPort 2400 because &quot;some laptops don't accept the built-in[modems], and some users are more used to the [WorldPort 2400],&quot; he said.andM;WorldPort 2400's indicator lights are one benefit to having an externalmodem, Kreisler added.andP;  &quot;I like the indicator lights for my purposes, tomonitor the status of the line.andP;  They also help me analyze call-in problems,&quot;he said.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
