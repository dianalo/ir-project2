The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion ofthe economy increased at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in theApril-June period, up from the 0.2 percent gain reported inpreliminary data last month and much better than the 1.3 percentdecline in the first quarter.   The department said unit labor costs _ a key inflation indicator_ increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the quarter, downfrom the 6.2 percent jump reported for the first quarter butnonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation.   Analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with therecent slowing of the economy's growth rate.   But they said poor performance in the non-financial corporatesector _ a category, including most service industries, in whichproductivity fell and labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1 percentannual rate _ suggested inflation was still around.   ``The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging''because the service-producing sector makes up roughly 80 percent ofthe economy, said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co.Economic Advisors.   ``The 0.7 percent increase is a low number but consistent withthe cyclical problems that typically occur as growth slows down,''said economist Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``Employers arereluctant to trim their work force so that when the economydownshifts you have to expect a dip in productivity growth.''   The second-quarter improvement came as output grew at an annualrate of 2.4 percent while hours worked expanded by 1.7 percent.   Gains in productivity _ output per hours worked _ are seen asvital to economic growth at times of near full employment and tightlabor markets in skilled jobs.   Improved productivity in manufacturing also helps U.S.competitiveness in world markets. Workers in manufacturing posted aproductivity gain of 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the secondquarter, up from the 2.4 percent increase reported in thepreliminary data.   The Labor Department said hourly compensation rose at an annualrate of 5.6 percent in the quarter, but consumer inflation continuedto more than erase the wage gains. Real hourly compensation _ hourlycompensation minus consumer inflation _ fell 0.7 percent, thedepartment said.   The preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase atan annual rate of 5.5 percent and the decline in real wages at 0.9percent. In the first quarter, hourly compensation rose at an annualrate of 4.8 percent and real wages declined 0.6 percent.   The 2.9 percent annual-rate productivity gain in manufacturing inthe second quarter followed a 2.1 percent gain in the January-Marchperiod. Unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at an annual rate of0.4 percent after increasing at an annual rate of 1.0 percent in thefirst quarter.   ``We have a lean and mean manufacturing sector,'' said Sinai.``This is really something to cheer about in the continued strongperformance in productivity and cost control in the manufacturingsector.''   The second-quarter manufacturing gain came as output rose at anannual rate of 2.9 percent while the number of hours worked heldsteady after rising at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the firstquarter.   Factory workers saw their real wages fall at an annual rate of3.7 percent in the second quarter, with inflation stripping away anincrease of 2.4 percent, at an annual rate, in hourly compensationin manufacturing, the Labor Department said.   A separate figure that includes the farm sector of the economyshowed that productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent, asoutput climbed 1.9 percent while hours worked rose by 0.6 percent.The report attributed that gain to improved productivity by farmworkers.</TEXT></DOC>
