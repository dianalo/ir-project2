(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has given up his NewYork state residency, ending any chance he'll run for governor nextyear, a spokesman said.   Kemp notified the Erie Board of Elections on Monday that he waswithdrawing his voting registration there, said Robert Nipp, aHousing and Urban Development spokesman in Washington.   ``He intends to register in Montgomery County, Maryland,'' saidNipp.   Nipp said Kemp was making the change because ``he's no longer acongressman from Buffalo'' and ``he has his home in Bethesda.''   Steven LaFever, a spokesman for the New York state RepublicanCommittee and a former official at the state Board of Elections,said that to run for governor a person must be a resident of thestate for five consecutive years.   State GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett had hoped that Kemp, whounsuccessfully sought the 1988 Republican presidential nomination,might be willing to challenge Democrat Mario Cuomo's expectedre-election bid next year.   A recent GOP poll had found that, among those New Yorkerssurveyed, Kemp tested well against the popular Cuomo. The governorwon that theoretical matchup, 48 percent to 42 percent.   Cuomo, should he do well in a re-election bid next year or skipit entirely, is considered a potential 1992 presidential contender.Because of that, supporters of President Bush would like to seeCuomo given a tough race next year.</TEXT></DOC>
