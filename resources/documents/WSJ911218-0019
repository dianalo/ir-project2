And yes, the plaintiffs' lawyeradmitted to the West Virginia Supreme Court last month, thelawsuit's only link to West Virginia was that the plaintiffs'lawyers are based there.   West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Richard Neely decidedhe didn't need more to recognize another punitive-damageslawsuit that didn't belong in his court. He walked out of thehearing. The case was soon dismissed by unanimous vote of thestate justices.</LP><TEXT>   Not all abusive punitive-damages claims raise jurisdictionissues or are so easy for judges to dismiss. One problem isthat the U.S. Supreme Court recently tried but failed toissue clear rules for how, when and why juries can awardthese quasi-criminal penalties. In Pacific Mutual Life v.Haslip, decided in March, the justices upheld damages of afew thousand dollars that were punitived up for a total awardof nearly $1 million.   The justices agreed that some punitives might beunconstitutional, but offered no clear rules. &quot;We cannot drawa mathematical bright line between the constitutionallyacceptable and unacceptable,&quot; Justice Harry Blackmun wrotefor the court. &quot;General concerns of reasonableness andadequate guidance from the court when the case is tried to ajury properly enter into the constitutional calculus.&quot; Thecourt offered little more guidance than this. Justice SandraDay O'Connor's dissent warned that this vague standard leftjuries free to &quot;target unpopular defendants, penalizeunorthodox or controversial views, and redistribute wealth.&quot;   In the nine months since Haslip, lower federal courts andstate courts have tried to interpret its hazy language onwhen the Due Process Clause protects defendants. In WestVirginia, for example, Ashland Oil is waiting to hear if thestate Supreme Court will go beyond dismissing the part of acase against it that should have been brought in Kentucky.The firm appealed a $10 million award -- $9 million of it inpunitive damages -- to West Virginians harmed by trivialpollution from one of its refineries. The opinion is expectedsoon.   A unanimous decision written by Justice Neely in anothercase this month strongly suggests that his state, which can'tafford to scare off business, has had enough of arbitrarypunitive damages. This opinion invalidated a punitive-damageaward that was not 10 times the amount of actual damage, or50 times or even 1,000 times. A jury decided that a landfillcaused no actual harm to the plaintiffs who lived nearby, butstill awarded $105,000 in punitive damages. The U.S. SupremeCourt couldn't devise a mathematical formula for outrageouspunitives, but the judge here allowed this equation: Nothingtimes Something equals Plenty.   Justice Neely reversed the punitive-damage award in thiscase, Fleming Landfill v. Garnes, after noting that thepurpose couldn't have been to teach the defendants a lessonor deter anything since the landfill -- &quot;an activity that isboth legal and socially useful&quot; -- did no wrong. Heinterpreted Haslip to mean that West Virginia appeals judgesmust reverse punitives using a test more narrow than theprevious non-rule rule of whether the verdict is &quot;monstrous,enormous, beyond all measure.&quot;   &quot;Although Haslip may not have created the clear,bright-line rules that we would all like, it is the beginningof national common law development in this area and not theend,&quot; Justice Neely wrote. He created a new state test forpunitive damages, including that punitives must have somereasonable relationship to the actual harm.   Justice Neely went out of his way to explain why thenational economy needs clear rules. &quot;State courts haveadopted standards that are, for the most part, notpredictable, not consistent and not uniform,&quot; he said. &quot;Suchfuzzy standards inevitably are most likely to be appliedarbitrarily against out-of-state defendants.&quot;   He cited the 1987 case of Pennzoil v. Texaco as theclassic &quot;primer on squeezing incorrect results out ofstraightforward law.&quot; The Texas courts upheld a $10 billionaward, including $3 billion in punitives, where the trialjudge misapplied the binding New York contract law.   &quot;Although the name Texaco suggests that the company mightget a friendly hearing in Texas,&quot; Justice Neely wrote,&quot;Texaco long ago stopped wearing cowboy boots and aten-gallon hat, moved its corporate headquarters to thesuburbs of New York City and tried very hard to forget itshumble origins on the Texas boondocks.&quot; In contrast, Pennzoilis based in Houston. Justice Neely said this explained theunprecedented damage award, which &quot;exceeded the grossnational product of over one-quarter of the member states ofthe United Nations because of trumped-up law and hard-corehome cooking.&quot;   Even if state courts wanted to bring some common senseback into the law, there is what could be called federalism'sfree-rider problem. West Virginia could, for example, limitdamages for people who contract polio from the vaccine inorder to keep the generally beneficial vaccine on the market,but Justice Neely explained why state courts rarely behave soaltruistically. &quot;We have no assurance that courts inCalifornia or Massachusetts will not put vaccinemanufacturers out of business or drive up the price ofvaccine by adopting a far more generous rule for their ownlocal plaintiffs.&quot;   This unusual candor about what motivates some judges isthe norm for Justice Neely, who came up with what could serveas a standard campaign platform position for state judges inhis book, &quot;The Product Liability Mess.&quot; He wrote, &quot;As long asI am allowed to redistribute wealth from out-of-statecompanies to injured in-state plaintiffs, I shall continue todo so.&quot; The lesson for the U.S. Supreme Court is that clearconstitutional prohibitions on punitive damages are the bestway to help state judges avoid the temptation to redistributewealth interstate.   Indeed, many state courts have upheld large punitivedamages despite Haslip. The Georgia Supreme Court upheld a$1.3 million judgment, saying &quot;nothing in the opinionmandates&quot; a comparison of the punitive to the actual damages.Nevada and Lousiana courts are among others that have upheldlarge awards during the past few months. On the other hand, aMaryland court reversed a $12.5 million punitive-damagesaward, noting this was more than 50 times the actual damages.A federal appeals court also recently ruled in a civil rightscase that the Virginia standard for punitive damages wasunconstitutionally vague.   States can have different rules for when punitive damagesmust be paid, but the Constitution is supposed to set out anational minimum standard for due process. The U.S. SupremeCourt failed to send a clear message about when punitives gotoo far, but the good news is that some judges managed to getthe hint that they should start to enforce theseconstitutional rights.</TEXT></DOC>
