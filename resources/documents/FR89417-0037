Lewicki, (202) 447-2145.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary Information:</T2> This proposed rule has been reviewedin accordance with Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1and has been determined to be ``non-major'' since it does meet the criteriafor a major regulatory action as stated in the order.The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certifiedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) because: (1) The proposed fee increases merely reflecta minimal increase in the cost-per-unit currently borne by those entitiesutilizing the services; (2) the cost increase will not affect competitionin the marketplace; (3) the use of classification and testing servicesand the purchase of standards is voluntary.The information collection requirements contained in this final rule havebeen previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assignedOMB control numbers under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).It is anticipated that the proposed changes, if adopted, would be madeeffective July 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="85">Fees for the Classification Under the Cotton Statistics and EstimatesAct of 1927</ITAG>The user fee charged to cotton producers for manual classification servicesunder the Smith-Doxey amendment to the Cotton Statistics and EstimatesAct (7 U.S.C. 473a) was $1.03 during the 1988 harvest season (53 FR 20089)as determined using the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton ClassingFees Act of 1987. The charges cover salaries, cost of equipment and supplies,and other overhead and include administrative and supervisory costs. Thisproposed rule would increase user fee for manual classification chargedto producers from $1.03 per bale to $1.23 per bale. This new fee was calculatedby using the 1988 base fee adjusted for the rate of inflation, the projectedsize of the crop and the addition of a surcharge necessary to maintainan adequate operating reserve. The 1988 base fee is $1.15 per bale. A 4.1percent, or five cents per bale, increase due to the Implicit Price Deflatorof the Gross National Product would be added to the $1.15 resulting ina 1989 base fee of $1.20 per bale. The 1989 crop is currently estimatedat 12,700,000 running bales. The base fee would be decreased two percentbased on the estimated size of the crop (one percent for every 100,000bales or portion thereof above the base of 12,500,000 bales). This percentagefactor would amount to a two cents per bale reduction and would be subtractedfrom the base fee of $1.20 per bale resulting in a fee of $1.18 per bale.There would be a surcharge of five cents added to the $1.18 per bale feesince the projected operating reserve is less than 25 percent. The projectedoperating reserve is 16 percent. This would establish the 1989 season feeat $1.23 per bale. No further adjustments would be warranted under theformula.Therefore, the fee for this service in andSection;28.909 during the 1989harvest season would be $1.23 per bale. The additional fee for High VolumeInstrument (HVI) classification would remain 50 cents per bale and thefee for HVI classification during the 1989 harvest season would be revisedto $1.73 per bale. As provided for in the Uniform Cotton Classing FeesAct of 1987, a 5 cent per bale discount would continue to be applied tovoluntary centralized billing and collecting agents.The fee for a manual review classification in andSection;28.911 would alsobe increased from $1.03 to $1.23 per bale since the fee for review classificationis the same as the original classification fee. For the same reason thefee for HVI review classification would be increased from $1.53 to $1.73per bale.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fees for Cotton Standards </ITAG>Practical forms of the cotton standards are prepared and sold by the CottonDivision offices in Memphis, Tennessee, under the authority of the UnitedStates Cotton Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 51 <T3>et seq</T3>.). The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub.L. 97-35) directs that the price for standards will cover, as nearly aspracticable, the costs of providing the standards. This proposal would increase the fees listed in andSection;andSection; 28.123and 28.151 for practical forms of the cotton standards, including bothgrade and staple standards for American Upland cotton, American Pima cottonand for cotton linters. The fees need to be adjusted due to increased costsfor salaries and preparation, delivery, and postage of the standards. Currentand estimated demand for the standards has also been factored into thefee revision since per unit costs are directly related to volume. The fees for American Upland cotton grade standards would be increasedfrom $100.00 to $110.00 f.o.b. Memphis, Tennessee, or overseas air freightcollect. The price would be increased from $104.00 to $114.00 for domesticsurface delivery and from $140.00 to $150.00 for overseas air parcel postdelivered. The fees for American Upland staple standards f.o.b. Memphisand overseas airfreight collect would increase from $14.00 to $16.00. Thedomestic surface delivered fee would increase from $16.00 to $18.00 andthe overseas air parcel post delivered fee would increase from $28.00 to$30.00. The fees for American Pima grade standards would increase from$126.00 to $140.00 f.o.b. Memphis or overseas air freight collect. Theprice would increase from $130.00 to $144.00 for domestic surface deliveredand from $166.00 to $180.00 for overseas air parcel post delivered. Feesfor American Pima staple standards would increase from $15.00 to $17.00for f.o.b. Memphis and overseas air freight collect. The domestic surfacedelivered fee would increase from $17.00 to $19.00 and the overseas airparcel post delivered fee would increase from $29.00 to $31.00. The feesfor linters grade strandards would be increased from $100.00 to $110.00f.o.b. Memphis or overseas air freight collect. The price for domesticsurface delivery would increase from $104.00 to $114.00 and the price foroverseas air parcel post delivery would increase from $140.00 to $150.00.The f.o.b. Memphis or overseas air freight collect fees for linters staplestandards would increase from $16.00 to $18.00. The delivered price wouldincrease from $18.00 to $20.00 for domestic and from $30.00 to $32.00 foroverseas air parcel post. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fees for Classification Services Under the United States Cotton StandardsAct </ITAG>Certain other cotton classification services are conducted under the UnitedStates Cotton Standards Act. Fees for these services have been reviewed.In order to recover increased costs, including supervision and overhead,it is proposed that the fees for classification of cotton or samples inandSection; 28.116 be increased: for grade, staple and micronaire readingsfrom $1.30 per sample to $1.45; for grade and staple only from $1.15 persample to $1.25; and for grade only or staple only from $.90 to $1.00.The fee in andSection; 28.117 for each new memorandum or certificate issuedin substitution for a prior one would increase from $4.00 per sheet to$4.50. The additional hourly fee charged for Form C determinations in andSection;andSection;28.120 and 28.149 would increase from $18.00 per hour or each portion thereofto $20.00 per hour, or each portion thereof, plus traveling expenses andsubsistence or per diem. The fee in andSection; 28.122 for a complete practicalclassing examination for cotton or cotton linters would increase from $125.00to $135.00 and the fee for reexamination for a failed part, either gradeor staple, would increase from $75.00 to $80.00. Fees for the classification,comparison, or review of linters in andSection; 28.148 would increase from$1.20 to $1.30 per bale or sample involved. In andSection; 28.148, the feefor classification or comparison of cotton linters and the issuance ofa memorandum would increase from $1.20 to $1.30 per sample. The United States Cotton Futures Act (7 U.S.C. 15b) authorizes the Secretaryto make such regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions ofthat Act. Pursuant to that authority, Part 27 of the regulations (7 CFRPart 27) provides for cotton classification under the Cotton Futures Actincluding fees to recover the costs of classification and micronaire. Underthis proposal, the fees charged for the services would be increased tocover the costs of providing such services, including overhead costs. These fees have been reviewed and it is proposed that the fees in andSection;27.80 for initial classification be increased from $1.20 per bale to $1.30per bale; for review classification to be increased from $1.40 per baleto $1.50 per bale. All supervision fees would be increased by 20 cents.Pursuant to andSection; 27.85, fees for withdrawal of requests or applicationsfor review, after such services have been started, are the same as thefees in andSection; 27.80 for services completed, so such charges would beaffected by this proposal. Fees for certificates which appear in andSection;27.81 would increase from 60 cents to 65 cents per certificate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Testing Services </ITAG>Cotton testing services are provided by USDA Laboratory in Clemson, SouthCarolina under the authority of the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Actof 1927 (7 U.S.C. 471-478). The tests are available, upon request, to privatesources on a fee basis. The Cotton Service Testing Amendment (7 U.S.C.473d) specifies that the fees for the services be reasonable and coveras nearly as practicable the costs of rendering the services. The costof providing these services has increased since the last fee increase in1987 due to higher costs for salaries and miscellaneous overhead costsincluding supplies and materials. Therefore, the fees for cotton testingservices would be increased to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costof these services.The fees for fiber and processing tests in andSection; 28.956, except items1.0, 5.0, 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 9.0, 15.0, 18.0, and 19.0 will be increased.The proposed fees are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,s0,10,10</C> <H1>Item No. </H1><H1>Current Fee </H1><H1>Proposed</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.0a <D>84.00 </D><D>84.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>88.00 </D><D>88.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>84.00 </D><D>84.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">d <D>124.00 </D><D>124.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.0a <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>16.00 </D><D>18.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">d <D>25.00 </D><D>27.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2.1a <D>23.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>25.00 </D><D>27.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>23.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">d <D>37.00 </D><D>39.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3.0 <D>95.00 </D><D>105.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3.1 <D>15.00 </D><D>17.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4.0 <D>25.00 </D><D>30.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4.1 <D>12.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5.0 <D>1.60 </D><D>1.60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6.0 <D>1.08 </D><D>1.10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.0 <D>8.50 </D><D>8.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7.1 <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.0 <D>8.75 </D><D>8.75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8.1 <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9.0a <D>8.75 </D><D>8.75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>6.50 </D><D>6.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>5.50 </D><D>5.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.0 <D>0.55 </D><D>0.65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.1 <D>0.30 </D><D>0.35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11.0 <D>10.00 </D><D>12.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>50.00 </D><D>60.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12.0 <D>6.00 </D><D>6.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.0a <D>65.00 </D><D>70.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>103.00 </D><D>108.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>125.00 </D><D>130.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.1a <D>48.00 </D><D>52.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>70.00 </D><D>74.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>97.00 </D><D>101.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13.2 <D>117.00 </D><D>122.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14.0a <D>22.00 </D><D>24.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>27.00 </D><D>29.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">c <D>32.00 </D><D>34.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15.0a <D>7.50 </D><D>7.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>13.00 </D><D>13.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">16.0 <D>14.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">17.00 <D>4.50 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>22.50 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18.0 <D>25.00 </D><D>25.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">19.0 <D>80.00 </D><D>80.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.0 <D>105.00 </D><D>110.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.1 <D>80.00 </D><D>85.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21.0 <D>95.00 </D><D>100.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">22.0 <D>140.00 </D><D>145.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">23.0 <D>200.00 </D><D>210.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">24.0 <D>220.00 </D><D>230.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25.0 <D>29.00 </D><D>31.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25.1 <D>40.00 </D><D>42.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26.0a <D>75.00 </D><D>80.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">b <D>22.00 </D><D>23.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">27.0 <D>11.00 </D><D>12.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28.0 <D>4.50 </D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">28.1 <D>6.50 </D><D>7.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29.0 <D>17.00 </D><D>18.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29.1 <D>29.00 </D><D>31.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30.0 <D>12.00 </D><D>14.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum <D>36.00 </D><D>42.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31.0 <D>2.50 </D><D>3.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32.0 <D>3.00 </D><D>3.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33.0 <D>1.10 </D><D>1.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33.1 <D>12.00 </D><D>15.00</D></ITAG></ITAG>It has been determined that a 15 day comment period is appropriate forinterested persons to comment on this proposed regulatory revision becauseall user fee increases in the revision are required by the Acts governingthe services, and the new user fee charged to producers for the classificationof cotton must be announced by June 1, 1989, as provided in the UniformCotton Classing Fees Act of 1987.
