(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The image of a dour, shoeless English boyand his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and GeoffreyGiuliano to collaborate on a book.   The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird'shalf-brother and Giuliano's idol. But the neglected urchin and hislive-it-up mother _ who was also Baird's mother _ never existed, theauthors say.   ``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John,and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy!' That's not mybrother, that's not my mother, that's not my children'sgrandmother,'' said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in theUnited States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon andhis Liverpool roots.   Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother''was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in thisErie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.   The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from twodifferent motives. Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon. Bairdwanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whosename also was Julia.   The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing amoody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in abathroom with good acoustics.   Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after hisfather decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi,Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.   ``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird. ``I wanted to set therecord straight about our mother, and that ties in with John. I feelmy mother has been badly misrepresented in the press.''   Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born sevenyears after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, JohnDykins. She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with theirparents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins _ and bigbrother John.   The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtubwhen teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop byfor bathroom jam sessions with Julia. It tells of an alternatelythoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters atthe movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at aBeatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girlsout of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to stormthe stage.   But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart,had a loving relationship.   The book got its start after Baird watched a British televisionspecial in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.The show presented Julia ``as an unfit mother, no mother at all,''Baird said.   Baird complained and was urged to tell her story. She wrote anessay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool. Then she metGiuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``TheBeatles: A Celebration.''   Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to workwith him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews withBaird in England. While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy toMcCartney. He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword forthe book.   With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a familyalbum than a biography. Giuliano's text reads like oral history, asif a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook acrossthe reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.   However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child'srecollections of an aspiring brother. After Julia was killed in atraffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losingcontact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to theUnited States. The end of the book describes what Baird callsLennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and herstep-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.   Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother butinsists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's earlyyears.   ``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said.``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the doorsaying, `Write your story, name your price.' We quickly showed themthe door.''   Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography,``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time asBaird's book. Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of ElvisPresley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brandsLennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.   ``I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and Iknew what the tone would be,'' Baird said. ``Most people, includingGoldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong.''   Giuliano was harsher.   ``Goldman was in it for the money from day one,'' Giuliano said.``Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough. Sowhat's his motive? If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the mostdough.''   Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing. Sheagreed to change the title from ``My Brother John'' to ``JohnLennon, My Brother.''   The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specsalso help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books. They'reon the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennoninherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said.   The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of abrother whose art touched millions.   ``It's not a major biography,'' Giuliano said. ``This book is alittle slice out of a big pie, out of a big life. It offers a lot ofpreviously unknown details on Lennon's early life. It's asympathetic view, sure, but what's not to love?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Fri Jan. 20</NOTE></DOC>
