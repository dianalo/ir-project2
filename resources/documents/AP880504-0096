The Iraqi raids were the first major attacks on Iranian citiessince the two Persian Gulf war foes halted the latest round oftheir so-called ``war of the cities'' April 21. They pounded eachother's cities with more than 300 missiles Feb. 29-April 21.   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted amilitary communique as saying one formation of fighter-bombersattacked and set fire to the refinery in the southwestern city ofShiraz. The refinery, one of five in Iran, has a capacity of 48,000barrels a day.   Other warplanes hit a petrochemical plant in the area, the Iraqireport said.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored inCyprus, said several people were killed in the raids on Shiraz.   Two French-built Mirage F-1s were downed in the second raid,IRNA said.   The agency reported that one pilot bailed out and was captured.There was no word on the fate of the other pilot.   Tehran Radio said a third Iraqi jet was shot down, but did notsay where or give any other details.   IRNA said an industrial plant in the oil-producing Gachsaranregion, 100 miles west of Shiraz, also was bombed in another Iraqiraid.   There was no mention of that raid in the Iraqi communique, whichdeclared that Iraq would inflict ``further painful blows on theIranian regime'' until it complies with the U.N. Security Councilcease-fire resolution passed last July 20.   Iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if Iran does.Tehran has said it will not comply until Iraq is branded theaggressor.   The Iraqi air force attacks Iran's refineries and other oilinstallations to throttle the Iranian economy and force and end tothe 7{-year-old war.   Oil industry sources have reported that Iran's refining capacityhas been cut by about one-third in recent weeks because of thebombing. This has forced Iran to import unprecedented amounts ofrefined products such as kerosene and jet fuel, the sources said.They spoke on condition of anonymity.   Iran has reported Iraqi warplanes repeatedly have flown over itswestern cities in the last few days. IRNA said the intruding jetswere driven off by anti-aircraft fire.   Both countries have claimed their border towns have come underartillery fire recently.   Both have reported continued artillery battles and skirmishesalong the 730-mile frontline in the past two weeks. But there hasbeen no major ground action since April 18, when Iraq recapturedthe southern Faw peninsula. Iran seized control of the peninsula inFebruary 1986.   Iran has reported sending tens of thousands of men to the frontin a renewed mobilization following naval clashes with the UnitedStates in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy said it sank or disabledsix Iranian vessels in the April 18 fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
