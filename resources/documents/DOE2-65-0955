Four full size dipoles have been testedand all exceeded the operating field. The main dipoles for the SSC projectare 17 meters in length with an operating field of 6.6 T. Five of thesehave been tested. Rough calculations show that the possibility of operatingfuture such large colliders at --80 K instead of --4 K is unlikely tohave a major impact upon their cost or feasibility. However, increasingthe critical field of practical superconductors (either by lowering theoperating temperature or further conductor development) could have amajor impact upon the specialized magnets used in the intersection regionsof such machines.</TEXT></DOC>
