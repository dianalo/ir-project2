L. 95-87, 30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq</T3>., establishes an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaimingand restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining.This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the productionof coal. Lands and waters eligible for reclamation are those that weremined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamationstatus prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamationresponsibility under State/Tribe or Federal law. Title IV of SMCRA establishesthe conditions under which States/Tribes may obtain primary authority toimplement this reclamation program.The Secretary of the Interior approved the Missouri AMLR program on January29, 1982. Information pertinent to the general background, revisions, andamendments to the initial program submission, as well as the Secretary'sfindings and the disposition of comments can be found in the January 29,1982, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 4253-4254).Information concerning the previously approved plan and the proposed amendmentsmay be obtained from the agency offices listed under <T2>``ADDRESSES.''</T2>The Secretary has adopted regulations that specify the content requirementsof a State reclamation plan and the criteria for plan approval (30 CFRPart 884). The regulations provide that a State may submit to the OSMREproposed amendments or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If theamendments or revisions change the scope or major policies followed bythe State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Deputy Directormust follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14 in approving or disapprovingan amendment or revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Amendment</ITAG>By letter dated August 22, 1988, Missouri submitted a reclamation planamendment to OSMRE (Administrative Record No. AML-MO 59). The proposedamendment consists of a complete revision to the approved Missouri Planas provided for by 30 CFR 884. Specifically, the following areas of theplan are being revised.1. Organization (30 CFR 884.13(d)(1) and (2)): Missouri is proposing toupdate certain portions of its AMLR plan to reflect changes that have occurredin the State agency structure. The State has also submitted additionalmaterial incorporating into the plan the staffing policies outlined inthe State manual of personnel procedures.2. Project selection (30 CFR 884.13(c)(2)): Missouri has submitted revisedproject scoring criteria to ensure that projects involving threats to thepublic health and safety are addressed before lower priority problems.Missouri is also proposing a project prioritization methodology based uponthe OSMRE ``Abandoned Mine Land Inventory Update Manual, August 1984''.3. Reclamation on private land (30 CFR 884.13(c)(5)): Missouri has submittedprocedures to clarify 10 CSR 40-9.060 regarding liens and appraisals onprivate lands.4. Rights of entry (30 CFR 884.13(c)(6)): The State has submitted additionalmaterial concerning non-concensual entry requirements as specified in 30CFR 877.13(c).5. Coordination of Reclamation Activities (30 CFR 884.13(c)(3)): The Statehas proposed amending its coordination procedures to eliminate the requirementfor a State Reclamation Committee. Missouri has proposed procedures forcoordinating with the agencies represented in the original State ReclamationCommittee and with other interested agencies on an individual basis, inthe development of construction projects.6. Land Acquisition, Management and Disposal (30 CFR 884.13(c)(4)): Missourihas proposed adding a procedure to allow for acquisition of land throughsale, donation or condemnation in accordance with the provisions outlinedin 30 CFR 879, 10 CSR 40-9.040 and 10 CSR 40-9.050.7. Database (30 CFR 884.13(f): Missouri is proposing to amend the databasepertaining to eligible lands and waters incorporating approved AML inventorysites.OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the October 27, 1988,<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 43450-43452), and, in the same notice,opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a publichearing on its substantive adequacy. No public comments were received byNovember 28, 1988, the close of the public comment period. Since no onerequested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, the scheduledhearing was cancelled.Following a thorough review of the Missouri amendment, OSMRE notified theState on December 19, 1988 of the need for several nonsubstantive editorialchanges and clarifications. On January 13, 1989, Missouri submitted thenecessary clarifications and editorial corrections. The Deputy Directorhas determined that these corrections are insignificant in nature and accordinglyrequire no further public comment.Under SMCRA, OSMRE codifies the approved requirements of individual Statesincluding decisions on State reclamation plans and amendments under Parts900 and 950 of 30 CFR Subchapter T. Provisions relating to Missouri arefound in 30 CFR Part 925.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Deputy Director's Findings</ITAG>In accordance with section 405 of SMCRA, the Deputy Director of OSMRE findsthat Missouri has submitted an amendment to its Abandoned Mine Land ReclamationPlan and has determined pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15, that:1. The State provided adequate notice and opportunity for public commentin the development of the amendment and that the record does not reflectmajor unresolved controversies.2. Views of other Federal agencies having an interest in the plan havebeen solicited and considered.3. The State has the legal authority, policies and administrative structurenecessary to implement the amendment.4. The plan amendment meets all requirements of the OSMRE, AMLR programprovisions.5. The State has an approved Surface Mining Regulatory Program.6. The proposed amendment is in compliance with all applicable State andFederal laws and regulations.Under SMCRA, OSMRE codifies the approved requirements of individual States/Tribes,including decisions on State/Tribe reclamation plans and amendments, under30 CFR Parts 900 to 950. Provisions relating to Missouri are found in 30CFR Part 925. Based on the findings above, the Deputy Director is amending30 CFR 925.20 to codify his approval of the Missouri amendment of August22, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Public and Agency Comments</ITAG>As discussed in the section of this notice entitled ``Discussion of ProposedAmendment,'' OSMRE solicited public comment and provided opportunity fora public hearing on the proposed amendment. Since no one requested an opportunityto testify, the public hearing scheduled for November 21, 1988, was cancelled.No comments were received from the public during the comment period, whichclosed on November 28, 1988.Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(2), comments were also solicited from variousFederal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Missouri plan.A summary of the comments received and their disposition appears below.1. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that restoration of wetlandsshould be included as one of the priorities of the Land Reclamation Program,and questioned Missouri's emphasis on restoration of agricultural productivity.In response, the Deputy Director notes that the priorities outlined inthe Missouri Plan are identical to those in section 403 of Pub. L. 95-87.Revision of these priorities is not within the scope of this amendment.2. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that the portion of theMissouri Plan enumerating the specific benefits to be considered when selectingreclamation projects should include preservation and/or restoration ofwetlands and floodplain values. The Deputy Director finds that this portionof the Missouri Plan has not been revised and that the comment is outsidethe scope of this amendment.3. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that wetlands should beincluded in Missouri's project selection criteria. The Deputy Directoracknowledges the importance of protecting wetland resources and notes thatindividual reclamation projects are reviewed prior to approval to ensurethat negative impacts to wetlands do not occur.However, restoration of wetlands is not one of the authorized purposesof the AMLR Fund and is therefore not within the scope of this amendment.The Deputy Director notes that regular coordination between the OSMRE,the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineerswill continue, in order to ensure the protection of wetland resources.4. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that the Rare and EndangeredSpecies list included in the Missouri Plan was out of date and supplieda revised list to the OSMRE. The Deputy Director concurred and requiredthe State to replace the outdated list with the current one.5. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commented that the maps and legendsincluded in the Missouri Plan reproduced poorly and were hard to read.The Deputy Director notes that the maps are informational only and do notmaterially affect the implementation of Missouri's AML Program. Originalcopies of the maps are available from the State of Missouri and from originalreference documents.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Deputy Director's Decision</ITAG>Based upon the findings enumerated above, the Deputy Director is approvingthe Missouri amendment. A copy of the approved amendment can be obtainedby contacting the offices listed under <T2>``ADDRESSES''.</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Matters</ITAG>1. Federal Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 etseq.2. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act On November 23, 1987, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) grantedOSMRE an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291for actions directly related to approval or disapproval of State/TribeAMLR reclamation plans and amendments. Therefore, this action is exemptfrom preparation of a regulatory impact analysis and regulatory reviewby OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). No burdenwill be imposed upon entities operating in compliance with the Act.3. National Environmental Policy ActApproval of State/Tribe AMLR plans and amendments is categorically excludedfrom compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act by the Departmentof the Interior's Manual; 516 DM 6, Appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(30). <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>The final rule is effective upon date of publication. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d),a rule may not be made effective less than 30 days after publication, unless,among other things, good cause exists and is published with the rule. Goodcause exists to make the final rule effective upon publication because:(1) Missouri's Department of Natural Resources Land Reclamation Programis fully staffed and currently administering the abandoned mine land reclamationprogram; and (2) OSMRE wishes to expedite the implementation of the revised AMLR planamendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 925</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, 30 CFR Part 925 is amended as set forth herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert H.
