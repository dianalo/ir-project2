The Providence, R.I.-based manufacturer's senior debt is rated double-B-minus, and the subordinated debt is rated single-B. Also on CreditWatch with negative implications is about $30 million of single-B subordinated debt of Nortek's Monogram Industries Inc. unit.    The ratings agency cited &quot;subpar&quot; performances at several of Nortek's diversified businesses, and said that considerable losses on investment securities are &quot;impacting 1987 results and depleting liquidity earmarked for future acquisitions.&quot;    Nortek has grown rapidly in recent years, often through acquisitions. But, the rating agency said, &quot;given reduced liquidity and current market conditions, management's growth-through-acquisition strategy raises questions about the firm's future direction.&quot;    Company officials weren't immediately available for comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Nortek shares closed at $8.125, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
