The audit praises at length program reforms ordered by new HUDSecretary Jack Kemp but said the agency's field offices have beenslow to implement them, causing ``no visible improvement in thesystem.''   In another development, The New York Times reported that DeborahGore Dean, a key figure in the investigation of political abuse ofHUD programs, stated in a deposition that she had her office filesshredded as she was leaving her job as executive aide to Kemp'spredecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr.   ``I gave them to the Inspector General and had them shredded bythe Inspector General,'' Ms. Dean said in the April 1988 deposition,the Times reported in its Saturday editions.   Inspector General Paul A. Adams, HUD's chief internalinvestigator, told the Times he did not know what Ms. Dean wastalking about and ``I can't imagine under what circumstances wewould do anything like that.''   Federal agencies differ on their rules for saving office filesand there was no indication of any wrongdoing by Ms. Dean in herhandling of the documents, the Times said.   Ms. Dean, Pierce's assistant from 1984 to 1987, gave thedeposition in a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicagowhich involved developers accusing HUD of reneging on an agreementto renegotiate the terms of a mortgage on a large housing project.   The HUD auditors' report program reforms on attributes part ofthe problem to a lack of direction from HUD headquarters.   ``Problems still exist and will continue to exist unless there isa coordinated leadership drive by the various offices inheadquarters who are responsible for property dispositionactivities,'' the auditors said in the report, which was obtained byThe Associated Press. ``This leadership and coordination was notapparent during our review.''   The audit was completed last week and covered the January-Mayperiod.   HUD officials on Friday said it was unfair to take the criticismas a reflection on Kemp's leadership, noting that he did not come tothe agency until February and then had to assemble a managementteam. HUD spokesman Jack Flynn said Kemp was not briefed on theproblems in the single-family home program until April andimmediately took steps to improve it.   Among those steps was a June letter to HUD's regional directorsin which Kemp warned that their jobs would depend on improvements inmanaging the program, under which HUD hires private closing agentsto handle property transactions.   The audit referred to that letter as one of the Kempadministration's positive steps.   ``Your responses have been very positive and indicate that muchis being done to improve control over the handling of property salesand related proceeds,'' said the report. ``Nevertheless, becausecertain actions that were promised in connection with our previousreports have not been implemented or are being implemented veryslowly, we are reopening our previous report findings.''   The new report recommended tighter regulation of the closingagents, including requiring them to obtain licenses and filefinancial disclosure forms.   The single-family program has received considerable attentionduring the recent investigations of mismanagement, fraud andinfluence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan administration.   A 1987 nationwide review of HUD's sales and acquisitions ofsingle-family properties found many private closing agents hired byHUD were late in paying the agency millions of dollars _ and in somecases weren't paying at all.   Among the agents was a Maryland woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' aftershe said she kept more than $5 million that belonged to the agencyand gave some of it to charity.   That audit blamed most of the problems on outdated accountingsystems and lax monitoring of closing agents. A dozen agents areunder investigation and several are being sued to recover money HUDsays is owed.   Some new initiatives designed to tighten controls on the programwere established prior to Kemp's appointment and he has sinceordered other changes. The auditors praised the promises but saidHUD has been slow to translate them into action.   The most serious transgression, the auditors said, was that somefield offices still aren't requiring closing agents to submit proofthat the money due HUD was wired to the agency.   ``Delays in the submission of sales proceeds and sales packagesstill exist and, in some cases, available evidence indicates thatlarge amounts of money have been misappropriated,'' the auditorssaid.   The report said HUD failed to meet a May target for establishinga new automated accounting system for the program and that somefield offices aren't using a contract developed in 1987 that wasdesigned to make the closing agents more accountable.   In only 155 of the 448 cases examined during the audit did HUDreceive its money on time. Of the late payments, 38 were made 20days or more late.   HUD loses interest when it receives late money, but the reportdidn't estimate how much was lost because of the late paymentscovered by the audit.   The auditors reviewed eight HUD field offices and currently areexamining the administration of the program at several more.   More than $370,000 was recovered from closing agents because ofthe audit, but an Indianapolis agent still appears to owe the agency$257,000, said the report, which did not identify the agent.   At several of the eight offices some property files could not belocated, including 173 at the Denver ofice, where of the 298 filesreviewed only 43 contained records confirming that the salesproceeds were wired to HUD, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
