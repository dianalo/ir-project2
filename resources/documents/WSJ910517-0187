Some 8,000 passengers a day boardplanes here, and that's a problem.   &quot;We have too many travelers right now,&quot; says Yu Yanen,China Southern Airlines' president, over lunch at theairport. &quot;Look at this packed restaurant. Look at the queuesdownstairs. We hope to change this with more planes.&quot; Mr. Yupredicts that in the coming decade his airline easily willmore than double its traffic, to 10 million passengers ayear, and its Western jetliner fleet, to 50 planes. The lineis slated to get 14 new planes this year alone.</LP><TEXT>   While most of the world's airlines are attempting to wootravelers back to the skies in the aftermath of the PersianGulf war, China's carriers are struggling to cope withaverage passenger-traffic growth of some 24% a year. Thatrate of growth, probably the highest in the world, is forcingChina's aviation industry to mature in a hurry.   It is accelerating the pace of Beijing'sairline-decentralization policy and putting strains onairports, aircraft maintenance skills, pilot and crewtraining, and fleet financing. Such explosive growth also isencouraging new airlines to form and spurring aviation jointventures with Western partners.   China Southern provides a handy snapshot of the politics,the economics and the challenges of China's leap intoaviation's 21st century.   Based in Canton, the commercial capital of China'saffluent Pearl River delta, China Southern is one of thelatest offspring of the Civil Aviation Administration ofChina's massive restructuring. The CAAC used to be likeAeroflot; it did the flying, ran the airports, bought all theairplanes, looked after air-traffic control and aircraftmaintenance, and trained pilots nationwide.   But in 1988 Beijing decided that the unwieldy, inefficientCAAC should focus on needed safety and certification dutiesand leave the flying to others. Thus, the CAAC's regionaldivisions gradually are being turned into nominallyautonomous &quot;associate&quot; airlines with their own names, routenetworks and fleets.   In a parallel development, some cities and provinces aresetting up their own airlines. Rival carriers have popped upeven in cities that have CAAC associates. For example,Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing each have independent carriersalongside their CAAC airlines. The province of Zhejiang hasan airline, as does the port city of Xiamen. A carrier inUrumqi in western China is gearing up to become a CAACassociate.   While all must charge the same low prices and gainBeijing's permission to start up, buy planes and operateroutes, this lively diversity is a far cry from the CAACmonolith of only a few years ago.   China Southern, formerly the CAAC's Guangzhou RegionalAdministration, is the fifth associate in the CAAC family, asof Feb. 1. (The sixth, Shenyang-based China North, officiallytook off more recently.)   But China Southern's new name and new logo -- a red kapokblossom on a field of blue -- are only cosmetic. The companyhasn't yet spelled out how it is going to structure itself,much less sought Beijing's blessing for the plan. The samepeople hold the same jobs, and the same old problems dog thecompany.   Indeed, two wrecked airplanes from last year's hijackingand crash involving three jetliners still sit on the tarmac,witness to Chinese airlines' generally poor safety record.   Mr. Yu doesn't paper over the company's problems. Heconfirms that pilot training must improve, along with thequality of service on board. China Southern needs to operateits flights more punctually, improve connecting times out ofthe Canton airport for travelers in transit, and learn tomarket itself to passengers in its overseas destinations, hesays.   The finer points of the airline business, such as computerreservations, English-language proficiency, pricinginitiatives, advertising campaigns and better catering, willhave to come later.   Yet China Southern, with its current fleet of 21 Boeings,16 mostly Chinese and Soviet-built commuter aircraft, 15helicopters for oil-exploration work and 22 cropdusters andother agricultural aircraft, is thought to be China'sfastest-growing and most profitable carrier. Westernaerospace vendors say it is the most dynamic -- in part dueto the region's relative wealth and the Cantonese knack fordoing business.   China Southern flies to 53 domestic cities from its homebase and from stations in the cities of Wuhan, Changsha andHaikou. Its four international destinations -- Bangkok, HongKong, Manila and Kuala Lumpur -- soon will be augmented byPenang and Jakarta routes. Company officials say the companylast year posted earnings equivalent to $100 million onrevenue of $350 million. A third of the revenue was inforeign currencies.   Even when it was strictly a state enterprise under thecontrol of CAAC, China Southern behaved with remarkableentrepreneurial vigor. The company owns 50% of a jointventure with Lockheed Corp. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. thatperforms aircraft maintenance and overhaul work at the Cantonairport to Western standards. Its cargo and cateringoperations are joint ventures with Hong Kong partners. Itrecently became the first airline in China to acquire newaircraft through operating leases, a kind of rental for whichthe carrier pays monthly fees and must return the planes atthe end of the contract period. China Southern is setting upa joint venture in Zhuhai to train pilots on modern flightsimulators. It holds a half-interest in one of theindependent regionals, Xiamen Airlines.   The aggressive Mr. Yu, 54 years old, receives salesmenfrom Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas when he isn't offvisiting Western aircraft factories himself. He plans to goto Ireland in June to visit GPA Group Ltd., which isproviding 15 planes on operating leases. But he also watchesthe political side of things, and lobbies Beijing just ashard as ever. &quot;Yes, we still need permission from CAAC&quot; to domost things, he says. &quot;If I work harder, it's easy to getpermission.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
