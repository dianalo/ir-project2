Former owner Stanley E. Adams Jr., who once soughtpermission to open a Lamar Savings branch on the moon, wasnamed in all 14 counts of the indictment.</LP><TEXT>   The indictment, returned late yesterday by a federal grandjury in Austin, also charged former Lamar Savings officersMilton R. Perry and Reuben Coleman, both of Austin, andFrederick Scheibe of San Antonio.   The indictment is the latest in the Justice Department'sstepped-up effort to prosecute the people believed mostresponsible for the billions of dollars in losses at thenation's thrifts. The crackdown so far has been focusedprimarily on Texas Sandamp;Ls.   Lamar Savings collapsed in late 1985 after havingballooned to become the 12thlargest thrift in Texas. Thethrift, which had about $2 billion in assets when it failed,fueled its growth by offering some of the highest rates ofinterest available in the U.S. for deposits, which drewmillions of dollars to the institution. The deposits wereused to finance real-estate ventures that later soured.   The indictment accuses Mr. Adams and the three formerofficers of conspiring to conceal Lamar Savings' troubledfinancial condition from federal thrift regulators. As partof those efforts, the indict ment alleges, the thriftofficials would arrange for borrowers to sign up for &quot;shamloans&quot; to finance purchases of repossessed real estate fromthe thrift's portfolio. The borrowers, in many instances,weren't required to repay the loans, but the thrift was ableto book immediate gains for making the loans and for&quot;selling&quot; troubled real estate, according to the indictment.   Two Lamar Savings borrowers, real estate developers LouisG. Reese III and Robert Hayden Brown, both of Dallas, wereeach indicted on conspiracy and five other charges. Mr. Reesewas a borrower at several now-failed Texas thrifts, includingSunbelt Savings Association of Texas and Western SavingsAssociation.   Mr. Reese's attorney, William M. Ravkind of Dallas, saidhis client was forced to take on the loans for Lamar'srepossessed real estate in order to obtain financing for hisown real-estate projects. Mr. Brown's attorney couldn't bereached for comment.   None of the three former officers could be reached forcomment.   The indictment of Mr. Adams had been expected for severalweeks, mainly because of an unusual public-relations campaignby Mr. Adams himself.   Beginning in mid-May, an Austin public-relations operativeretained by Mr. Adams arranged news conferences to needlefederal investigators for overlooking alleged wrongdoing byLamar borrowers and others; the operative, Garry Entress, wassubpoenaed to appear before the federal grand jury hearingevidence in the case.   Yesterday, the Justice Department issued a news release inWashington, D.C., before Mr. Adams's attorney, David Botsfordof Austin, was informed of the indictment.   Mr. Botsford said he couldn't comment on the specificcharges because he hadn't seen the indictment, but said hewould &quot;be very surprised if that indictment alleges thatStanley Adams profited by one dime from any of these allegedcrimes.&quot;   &quot;He gave his heart, soul and resources to thatinstitution,&quot; the attorney said, adding: &quot;I rather suspectthat Mr. Adams has been singled out for selective prosecutionfor his reputation in the industry as a maverick.&quot;   Mr. Botsford was referring to Mr. Adams's celebratedapplication to federal thrift regulators for permission toopen a Lamar Savings branch on the moon, going so far as toname a specific crater where the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration had indicated it would build a spacestation.   Federal thrift regulators didn't act on the application.</TEXT></DOC>
