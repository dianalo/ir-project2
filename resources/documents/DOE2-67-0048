For, even, if ithad a free hand in raising it s tariff, there is always the limitingfactor of 'What the traffic can bear.' Under this condition, the impositionof duties and taxes on electricity by government, as a convenient sourceof revenue for its exchequer, may well prove for supply utilities a caseof the proverbial last straw on the camel's back. Because, such a measuregreatly reduces the scope that a supply undertaking would otherwise havein raising its rates when it becomes so necessary. The government hasmay other options open to it for raising its revenue. The time has comewhen it may seriously consider the wisdom of levying any duty on electricityin the interest of financial health and general well-being of supplyundertakings. It is also highly debatable as to whether an ElectricitySupply Utility should at all be used as an instrument for bringing abouta reduction in social disparity by its having to put up with uneconomicrates for any class of consumers as has been the experience of CESC inrecent times.</TEXT></DOC>
