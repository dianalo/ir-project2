International Telecharge, which provides operator services to hotels, hospitals and private pay phone owners, filed suit last week against Telesphere, a long-distance carrier, in state district court here. In the suit, International Telecharge alleges that Telesphere tried to divert International Telecharge customers to Telesphere through &quot;false representations and wanton acts of unfair competition,&quot; and deliberately interfered with contractual relations between International Telecharge and its customers.    International Telecharge said the restraining order prevents Telesphere from soliciting International Telecharge customers. The order also restrains Telesphere employees from representing themselves as employees of International Telecharge or as being in any other way affiliated with International Telecharge.    Dennis Casey, chairman of Telesphere, said the order is &quot;meaningless&quot; and the suit is &quot;very frivolous,&quot; because Telesphere wasn't doing anything from which it needed to be restrained. He said Telesphere didn't contact International Telecharge customers, doesn't know who they are, and will do business as usual. Mr. Casey added that the order won't affect Telesphere's marketing effort.    International Telecharge said it intends to seek a permanent injunction, actual and exemplary damages, attorney fees and interest from Telesphere. It said the court set an Oct. 9 hearing date for its request for a temporary injunction. </TEXT></DOC>
