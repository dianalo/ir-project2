But whether it will satisfy MikhailGorbachev isn't certain.   During a summit meeting that featured confrontation overEurope's future, and again in meetings in Denmark andScotland, the West made a strong sales pitch, offering theSoviet president a tradeoff during the next six months.</LP><TEXT>   The West's terms are stark. The Soviets have lost EasternEurope and their foothold in Germany, so they must agree toan arms treaty sealing the Red Army's retreat from EasternEurope and destroying thousands of its weapons. They willhave to swallow the absorption of East Germany by WestGermany, and the full membership of the resulting unitedGermany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They willalso have to set a timetable for pulling 380,000 troops outof former East Germany.   In return, the West is promising three things. First, itwill help ease Soviet fears by agreeing to shrink Germanarmed forces over time, to keep Germany from building nuclearor chemical weapons, and to stress NATO's political role,rather than its military arms.   Second, it will help bankroll Soviet demilitarization andeconomic reform, through potentially huge economic aid fromGermany.   Finally, it will help Mr. Gorbachev feel involved andwanted in Europe by finding some permanent conference tableon European matters at which he can have a seat -- probably amore formal version of the 35-nation floating Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.   &quot;The states of Central and Eastern Europe and the SovietUnion all want to feel that they are part of a Europeanstructure, part of a European architecture,&quot; says Secretaryof State James Baker.   Another senior U.S. official who traveled with Mr. Bakerto last week's NATO meeting in Europe says the U.S. wants toensure &quot;that the Soviet Union should be part of the processof managing change,&quot; rather than a sullen -- and dangerous --spectator.   But Mikhail Gorbachev knows that except for the Germaneconomic aid, the West's package is largely cosmetic. Stripaway the niceties, and George Bush's vision of the future ofEurope still rests on two alliances from which the U.S.S.R.is excluded: NATO, whose mutual defense system would remain;and the European Community, which is moving toward anintegrated market and a close new relationship with the U.S.   Mr. Gorbachev will be working hard for a better bargainbefore December's CSCE summit meeting, at which all this issupposed to be wrapped up.   We are likely to hear more of the warning he says hedelivered to Mr. Bush at the summit: &quot;If we in the SovietUnion feel that we are being squeezed out, that . . .pressure is being applied on us for a unilateral advantage ofthe other side, well . . . that is something that does morethan just . . . cause concern.&quot;   Already, the West's offer has grown beyond the &quot;ninepoints&quot; offered by Mr. Bush at the summit. Mr. Baker, anexpert at compromise, has seized upon a vague Soviet idea fordirect NATO-Warsaw Pact talks, making it in effect a 10thpiece of the fig-leaf package.   &quot;Jim Baker won't care if there are 15 things on the list,as long as they just provide cover for Gorbachev,&quot; says anadministration official. One added item being discussed iswhether to let Soviet and East European officials attendcertain NATO political meetings as observers. Anotherpossibility involves using German construction companies tobuild new housing inside the U.S.S.R. for returning Soviettroops.   As the bargaining goes on, there are two main dangers forU.S. interests. One is that German officials will be so eagerfor a deal they will press Mr. Bush to weaken NATO too much,going beyond a shift in emphasis to gut its military core.Various German politicians are already talking about gettingall foreign troops out.   A second danger stems from uncertainty in Moscow. It isn'tclear whether Mr. Gorbachev will retain full authority overSoviet foreign policy in his struggle for power with therepublics led by Russia's Boris Yeltsin. Even if he does,some Soviet officials say there is a fierce internal debateamong his foreign policy advisers about how easily to settlewith the West -- and especially whether to cut a broad dealwith a West led by the U.S., or a narrow one with Germanyalone. The latter approach might cost Moscow less, but itwould cause Washington more pain.</TEXT></DOC>
