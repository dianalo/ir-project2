SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the first time, the wide-open spaces ofthe American West contain more people than the densely-packedNortheast, and the rapid Western growth will continue, the CensusBureau says.   The bureau predicts that between now and the year 2000 more thanhalf of all national population growth will occur in just threestates _ California, Florida and Texas.   The study adds that Texas is on the verge of crowding past NewYork as the nation's second most populous state. The projectionscall for Texas to surpass New York by 1995.   The Empire State now leads Texas 17.7 million to 17.2 million.But by 1995, Texas is expected to have just over 19 million people,with New York at only 17.9 million.   That transition is symbolic of the slippage in the Northeast,which has become the nation's least populated region, fallingbehind the West for the first time.   Bureau demographer Signe Wetrogen explained that the projectionsare based on assumptions about trends in births, deaths,immigration and movement within the country.   The Northeast has been declining in its share of the U.S.population, with less growth than other areas, she said.   ``It is the one region with the highest share of population inthe older ages, and has low birth rates,'' she explained.   Population shifts to the South and West in recent years havedrawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, she said.   ``So the (Northeast) region is left with more older people, andit's left without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.   But because it is smaller in area than other parts of thecountry, the Northeastern states remain the most densely packed.New Jersey leads the nation with more than 1,000 people per squaremile.   Tables included with the report show that between 1987 and 1988the West region increased from 49.6 million people to 50.5 million.At the same the Northeast edged up only from 50.1 million to 50.3million.   The 1988 estimates list the South with 85.1 million people,followed by the Midwest with 59.6 million.   While it was the center of early American development, theNortheast hasn't been the most populous region since 1820, when theSouth edged ahead. It remained second until 1880, when it fell tothird behind the Midwest.   By 1990 the projections call for the South to have 87.3 millionpeople, followed by the Midwest, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 millionand Northeast, 50.6. million. By the year 2000 the counts areexpected to be South, 96.9 million; Midwest, 59.6 million; West,59.4 million, Northeast, 51.8 million.   By 2010, the report adds, the West could surpass the Midwest andbe the second most populous region.   The projections show California remaining the most heavilypopulated state, growing from 28 million people today to 29.1million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000.   Florida is expected to remain the fourth largest, though by theyear 2010 it may be closing in on New York also.   By the year 2000, Illinois will have replaced Pennsylvania infifth place and Georgia will move into 10th, displacing NorthCarolina, the report says.   The U.S. is expected to grow from 243.3 million people in 1987to 267.7 million in 2000, an increase of 24.4 million.   In that period, California is expected to add 6 million, Florida3.5 million and Texas 3.3 million. The three-state total of 12.8million people represents 52 percent of the projected nationalincrease.   Predicted to lose population in this decade are the District ofColumbia and four states; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and WestVirginia.   In the 1990s population losses are expected in those states andnine others: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota,Nebraska, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming. On the other hand, thingsare expected to turn around in the District of Columbia, withgrowth resuming in the '90s.</TEXT></DOC>
