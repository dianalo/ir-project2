 The electromagnetic emissions of VDTs areblamed for everything from skin rashes and eroding eyesight tocancer and miscarriages.andP;  There has been no firm finding in anycase, but there are enough circumstantial warning signs to promoteincreased fear among office workers whose jobs depend on thesedevices.andP;  VDTs are regulated under the same laws that governtelevision set emissions.andP;  Manufacturers are using the same kindof leaded glass that reduced hazardous emissions from color TVstwo decades ago.andP;  If further studies determine a definite linkbetween VDTs and dangerous health hazards, it may result in amajor shakeup in technology used in the office.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     VDTsSafetyErgonomicsHealthStudyLegal IssuesMedical Issues.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>VDTs: ARE THEY SAFE?andP;  In 1980, two Chicago women working at VDTs developedcancer of the cervix.andP;  Within the year, one died; the other underwent severaloperations and is suing Raytheon, the manufacturer of the display.andP;  Were theVDTs at fault?andM;Until the court makes a judgment in the case, conventional wisdom might seemto indicate that fate, not the monitors, is to blame.andP;  With 26 million VDTsin use in the United States and about a million people who develop cancereach year, it seems likely that some of the cancer victims will have usedVDTs.andM;In 1985, a Washington, D.C., woman filed a Workmen's Compensation complaintclaiming that her skin rash resulted from working at a VDT.andP;  Her employer,ATandamp;T, fought the claim and prompted her union to solicit opinions fromoutside experts, but two years later, the company settled the claim for anundisclosed amount.andM;The woman's victory was not a sweet one, however.andP;  Her condition worsened;she developed breathing problems, muscle spasms, and memory lapses.andP;  Herphysician claimed she had become hypersensitive to common radiation generatedby, among other sources, VDTs and fluorescent lights.andP;  She was no longer ableto hold a job.andM;What was the connection--if any--between these ailments and working at a VDT?andO;Why aren't millions of other VDT users also complaining of these symptoms?andO;No one has the answers yet, but the VDT may hold some clues.andM;The DeviceandM;VDTs are the only electrical appliances that people sit very close to forlong periods of time.andP;  They generate a wide range fo electromagnetic waves.andO;The images they produce come from the light that is generated when aminiature gun in the VDT fires electrons onto a phosphorous screen.andP;  Theimpact of the electrons striking the phosphorus produces high-frequencyionizing radiation, such as X-rays, which have been proven to cause changesin living cells.andM;VDTs use two magnetic fields, located behind the screen, to aim the gun.andP;  Andlike all appliances, a VDT uses electricity, which also generates electricand magnetic fields.andP;  During the past four years, several studies have foundpossible links between magnetic fields similar to those generated by a VDTand fetal abnormalities in animals.andM;VDTs also produce electrostatic fields, similar to the static electricityproduced when you walk acrosss a carpet and touch a doorknob in winter.andO;These fields have been linked to skin rashes.andM;The StudiesandM;The potential health effects of VDTs are associated with low-frequencyelectromagnetic emissions.andP;  &quot;This is like other technologies that we'veintroduced and later found problems with; look at asbestos,&quot; says LouisSlesin, editor of the New York City-based VDT News.andP;  Many studies deal withelectrical devices other than VDTs but are important to the discussion,because they indicate that the emissions, once considered safe, may now behazardous.andM;In 1987, an epidemiological study of magnetic fields involving the New YorkPower Authority and the New York State Public Service Commission reportedthat a group of children living near overhead power lines were almost twiceas likely to develop leukemia as those who lived farther away.andM;Related studies at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Loma Linda,California, indicated that low-frequency magnetic fields may promote cancerby sdmulating growth-related enzymes in cells that are already cancerous.andO;And another study conducted by the Cancer Therapy and Research FoundationCenter in San Antonio, Texas, theorized that exposure to these fields alsomay make cancer cells more resistant to the body's defenses.andM;Critics of the studies, including Leonard Sagan of the Electric PowerResearch Institute, a utility-funded research group in Palo Alto, California,claimed that random occurrence and other environmental factors may haveinfluenced the results of the NEw York study, and that the cause-and-effectrelationships in the others were tenuous at best.andM;But last June, a study reported in the American Journal of IndustrialMedicine stirred bad press for VDTs.andP;  Among 1,583 pregnant women surveyed in1981 and 1982, clerical workers who used VDTs more than 20 hours a weekmiscarried more than twice as often as those who did not work at VDTs.andO;Marilyn Goldhaber, author of the study and an epidemiologist at the NorthernCalifornia Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, California,acknowledged that the results could have been biased if the respondentsblamed the VDTs ever when other factors, such as poor nutrition or lack ofexercise, were present.andM;&quot;Still, we now have some suggested findings; there is enough reason to becautious at this point,&quot; Goldhaber says.andP;  She believes that job stress,ergonomic factors such as sitting in a cramped position that might limitcirculation to a fetus, and exposure to low-level electromagnetic radiationcould also account for the miscarriages.andM;Several animal studies on pregnant mice (two sponsored by the NationalInstitute of Radiation Protection in Stockholm), and another on chickembryos, known as the Henhouse Studies and partly funded by the U.S.andP;  Navy'sOffice of Naval Research, implicated weak magnetic fields such as thoseemitted by VDTs as a cause of birth defects and miscarriages.andP;  But do theseanimal studies indicate similar problems for humans?andM;VDTs have also been targeted as the cause of other, less acute healthproblems.andP;  Dr.andP;  William Rea, a cardiovascular surgeon and now director of theEnvironmental Health Center, a private health center in Dallas, is completinga study of about 50 patients who suffered muscle spasms, fainting spells, andother symptoms that left them barely able to function.andP;  &quot;There is no questionin my mind that low levels of radiation are causing these health problems,&quot;says Rea, who treated the ATandamp;T employee who suffered the skin rash.andP;  &quot;We'vebeen able to reproduce the cause and effect.&quot;andM;Hari Sharma, a radiation safety adviser and nuclear chemist at the Universityof Waterloo in Ontario, contends that such reactions my also result frompeople using VDTs with abnormally high emissions.andP;  About 30 percent of theterminals in use may be generating high electric and magnetic fields, heestimates.andP;  &quot;Ninety-five percent of the people working with those terminalswill experience some discomfort, such as nausea, headache, or dry mouth.&quot;andM;Still, skeptics of these studies have a point.andP;  Gene Moss, health physicistfor the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, says he hasyet to see a scientific report documenting such reactions to low-levelelectromagnetic fields.andP;  &quot;There are 26 million of these devices out there; ifVDTs were causing these types of health problems, I would expect to seeepidemics,&quot; according to Moss.andP;  &quot;At this time we are not aware of any typesof symptoms in large numbers of people.&quot;andM;&quot;So far we have no conclusive evidence that these fields are harmful tohumans, but we could see new evidence tomorrow,&quot; says Arthur Ball, chief oftelevision products staff at the FDA's Center for Devices and RadiologicalHealth.andM;The LawandM;But there is no solid evidence to suggest we should banish VDTs from theworkplace.andP;  The federal government does regulate the health impact of a VDT'sionizing radiation, but not lower levels of radiation and their associatedmagnetic fields.andP;  Sweden is the only country with guidelines for magneticfields produced by VDTs.andM;Most VDTs fall under the regulatory umbrella that governs television sets.andO;The big X-ray scare in the 1960s, which found television sets producinghazardous levels of radiation, brought regulations that virtually eliminatedthe problem.andP;  Manufacturers began using heavy metals such as lead to shieldthe TV and VDT screen components in order to prevent this type of radiationfrom escaping.andM;Today, manufacturers of VDTs with graphics capabilities, which includevirtually all personal computers, must comply with these government standardsfor X-ray emissions.andM;But if VDTs are proven to be the source of serious, life-threateningailments--if they become the asbestos of the next decade--the workplace willundergo an upheaval.andM;&quot;If you show that it's hazardous, then you have to reexamine most of ourelectrical technology,&quot; says Louis Slesin, including all the invisible wavesthat we once considered to be perfectly safe: electricity, broadcast waves,and radar.andM;That could be a highly charged mess.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
