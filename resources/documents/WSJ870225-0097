But Moline, Ill.-based Deere's results for the rest of fiscal 1987 may improve somewhat because the company has increased scheduled output of farm equipment by 45% -- an amount some analysts said might be overly optimistic.    The loss in the quarter ended Jan. 31 was expected in light of the five-month United Auto Workers strike, which ended earlier this month after the UAW's membership approved a new contract. The dispute that led to the walkout, affecting more than 12,200 Deere union employees, concerned pension and job-security issues.    Deere's first-quarter sales plunged 32% to $478.4 million from $701.3 million in the year-earlier period.    The company said that although nonunion workers continued to operate some production lines, the work stoppage reduced its North American farm-equipment production by 59% during the quarter, and it had almost no output of industrial equipment.    A benefit of the strike was that it reduced bloated dealer inventories. Deere said inventories of farm equipment in the quarter fell by $221 million, to $1.86 billion. That compares with inventories of $2.6 billion a year earlier, the company said.    After a lengthy period of having to hold down production to reduce large inventories, Deere apparently believes that its current stockpiles are at acceptable levels. The company said it will begin to match production to actual sales, a strategy that it believes will result in the 45% increase in output for the rest of the year. It said total planned fiscal 1987 production is set at 16% above the year-earlier level.    But those forecasts may be somewhat rosy. Deere said they are based on the assumption that fiscal 1987 sales of agricultural products will about equal the year-earlier level. In this year's first quarter, however, retail demand for farm equipment trailed the fiscal 1986 level. Deere said also it expects demand for construction equipment to be somewhat higher this year.    &quot;Conditions in the farm-equipment industry, including overseas markets, continue to be difficult,&quot; acknowleged Robert A. Hanson, Deere's chairman. He also warned that &quot;earnings will remain under considerable pressure&quot; because of continued depressed conditions in the agricultural-equipment industry. He noted that Deere will have a substantial level of excess capacity despite the scheduled production increases.    Nevertheless, Mr. Hanson said he expects operations to show an improvement. &quot;There is a backlog of demand for many of our products which should allow us to manufacture in a more stable, efficient manner,&quot; he said.    Deere said it expects overseas production of farm equipment to fall by 14% in fiscal 1987. It said the business weakened in the fiscal first quarter because of deteriorating economic conditions for farmers in Europe and elsewhere. Deere said it had an overseas operating loss during the quarter, compared with a year-earlier profit. It didn't provide specific figures.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Deere shares closed at $29.375, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
