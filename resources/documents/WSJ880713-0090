Countersues Wilton, Claims Patent Abuse </HL><SO> </SO><CO> HWP </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> PALO ALTO, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hewlett-Packard Co. said it filed a countersuit against closely held Wiltron Co., charging the Morgan Hill, Calif., company with patent and copyright violations.    As reported, Wiltron sued Hewlett-Packard in May, alleging among other things that the maker of computers and scientific instruments violated federal antitrust laws and engaged in unfair marketing practices. Wiltron, a maker of electronic test equipment, is seeking triple the $40 million in damages it alleges it incurred.    Hewlett-Packard has called the Wiltron lawsuit &quot;without merit.&quot; In its countersuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Hewlett-Packard seeks an injunction against Wiltron using HP patents without authorization, along with payment of unspecified damages, the company said. The Hewlett-Packard suit also seeks to have Wiltron's suit dismissed.    A Wiltron spokesman said he hadn't seen the countersuit and declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
