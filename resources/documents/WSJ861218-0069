MitchellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/18/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MANBANKRUPTCIES (BCY)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><TEXT>   A federal judge's effective confirmation of Manville Corp.'s complex bankruptcy-law reorganization plan indicates that the big building and forest products concern might be free of bankruptcy-court oversight within a year.    &quot;It's like the starting gun is fixing to fire and we're finally, really, getting ready to run the race,&quot; W. Thomas Stephens, president and chief executive officer, said. &quot;We're anxious to get on with it.&quot;    The stock market is reacting with less enthusiasm, however. Manville shares lost 26% of their value in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, closing at $1.75, down 62.5 cents, on volume of 796,000 shares. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Manville's financial adviser, had indicated in court hearings that the common stock outstanding when Denver-based Manville emerges from bankruptcy-law protection would trade far below current levels, when adjusted for the 1-for-8 reverse split the plan calls for at the time of emergence.    U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland ruled late Tuesday night that the plan, designed to help Manville cope with thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits, meets statutory requirements. Tomorrow, the judge is expected to issue a formal order confirming the plan. But court challenges to the plan are expected.    While Mr. Stephens has set up a firm business plan for Manville, the cloud of Chapter 11 and the asbestos-related problems won't soon dissipate. The company will have to work hard to reestablish ties with the investment community, which has all but abandoned Manville's stock.    And Manville must fund a trust, the lynchpin of its plan, to pay present and future asbestos victims an estimated $2.5 billion over the next three decades.    &quot;It's going to be a constant issue to deal with,&quot; said Daniel Bayston, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps. &quot;Just because Manville will emerge from Chapter 11 does not mean it will have solved its asbestos problems.&quot;    Actually, Manville can't even emerge from bankruptcy court protection until it gets final orders barring punitive damages and an injunction preventing future asbestos-related lawsuits from being filed against the company. Future claimants would be required first to seek compensation from the victims' trust and a separate trust to pay asbestos-related property-damage claims. They could sue those trusts if settlement and arbitration procedures are exhausted.    A group of lawyers representing about 800 asbestos victims is promising to take its objections, which include those aspects of the plan, all the way to the Supreme Court. Common shareholders, facing a dilution of their stake in the company of up to 98%, also are expected to battle the plan.    Manville says it believes it will win the appeals and emerge from bankruptcy-law protection in 1987 or early 1988. The company filed for Chapter 11 in August 1982.    Looming over everything are the big cash payments Manville must make to the victims' trust -- and the control of the company that trust will have by holding 50% to 80% of the stock.    Four years after setting up the trust with $615 million in insurance proceeds, $200 million in cash and receivables and a note, and 50% of its stock, Manville must start funneling each year $75 million and 20% of its profit to it. The plan is predicated on Manville's sales growing at a compounded annual rate of 5.5% a year, with operating profit growing at 9.1% a year.    &quot;They have a mission to pay off these claims, which could go 40 years into the future,&quot; said Aaron Gold, a director who will step down when the company emerges. &quot;They're not going to get to do a whole lot else.&quot; Added Barbara T. Alexander, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst: &quot;Everything I can see and the numbers I've put together suggests they can meet those commitments. The question is to what extent, after they get their sea legs, they'll be able to do much more.&quot;    But Mr. Stephens, the chief executive, called the obligations &quot;just another debt&quot; -- not unlike the junk bonds other companies have to repay. There are even certain advantages, he contended: &quot;We certainly won't have to look over our shoulders at somebody trying to take us over.&quot; Of the fact that the company will be controlled by the trust, he added: &quot;Wouldn't you think it would be better to have 50% of your stock owned by a trust than by Carl Icahn?&quot;    The 44-year-old Mr. Stephens was named president in April after J.T. Hulce resigned following a dispute with asbestos victims' representatives. During his earlier tenure as chief financial officer, he had overseen a restructuring in 1985 that resulted in Manville closing some inefficient plants, phasing out the last of its asbestos business, and taking a $180 million charge against 1985 earnings. The company decided then to focus on its core businesses of glass fiber, forest and specialty products.    Mr. Stephens plans to stick to those businesses. But a six-month-long reassessment of that effort, which Mr. Stephens launched shortly after taking his new post, brought some grim news. In several of Manville's commodity product markets, such as glass-fiber insulation, lumber and plywood, the company saw slower growth and lower prices than it had counted on. &quot;Many of the things we'd planned to happen in 1986 just weren't happening,&quot; he said.    So Mr. Stephens has launched a cost-cutting drive to pare Manville's overhead $40 million a year, hoping for better insulation against swings in the business cycle. He has frozen the salaries of senior managers and he said that 500 salaried employees will be gone by year's end. There will be growth, he said -- the reorganization plan calls for $150 million a year in capital spending. Those expenditures will be focused on non-commodity businesses such as product packaging and automobile glass fiber, businesses to which Manville can &quot;add some value,&quot; he said.    But he said the key to his plan is a shift in organizational structure that will push decision-making down to its lowest possible level. He's not dictating where managers should cut overhead, for example, because &quot;the guys at the lower levels know a lot more about it than I do.&quot;    Meanwhile, to boost its image on Wall Street, Manville named Bill Bullock as head of investor relations, a post the company scrapped after its bankruptcy-law filing. Messrs. Bullock and Stephens, along with George Dillon, the former chairman of Butler Manufacturing Co. who was named chairman when John McKinney stepped down Sept. 1, have been busy courting analysts.    &quot;We can't flip a switch or do anything sexy,&quot; Mr. Stephens concluded. &quot;We simply plan to go about meeting our obligations to the plan and earning the respect of our customers.&quot;    ---   HOW MANVILLE'S CREDITORS WILL FARE   Present and future asbestos victims:    To be paid about $2.5 billion over three decades through a trust funded by:    --$615 million in insurance proceeds.    --$200 million in cash, receivables and a note.    --24million new common shares, issued upon Manville's emergence from bankruptcy-law proceedings.    --$1.8 billion in bonds, in installments of $75 million a year for 24 years, starting four years after Manville's emergence.    --A new preferred stock convertible into 72 million additional common shares.    --20% of net income starting four years after Manville's emergence.    Asbestos-related property damage claimants:    To be paid through a trust funded with $125 million cash, insurance proceeds that exceed $615 million, and any of the 20% profits not needed by the victims' trust.    Commercial creditors:   --100% of principal, with $247.5 million cash and $225 million in notes payable over 4 1/2 years.    --A portion of interest accrued since Aug. 26, 1982, through 11 million new common shares, warrants to buy seven million additional common shares and a choice of interest debentures or new Series B preferred stock.    Holders of preferred:   --Each $5.40 preferred share is swapped for 2.16 new common shares -- a total of 10 million shares -- plus one share of new Series B preferred, paying a $2.70 annual dividend starting seven years after Manville's emergence.    Holders of common:   --Now hold 24 million shares. After a reverse stock split, will hold three million, or about 6%, of the 48 million shares outstanding upon Manville's emergence, with potential further dilution to a 2% stake in the company. </TEXT></DOC>
