Several employers try to make life easier for workers with children. The Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines plans a summer program including field trips and swimming lessons. Fel-Pro Inc., a Skokie, Ill., auto-parts maker, provides a 250-acre summer camp for workers' kids. When doctors and nurses are delayed in the operating room, the child-care center at St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tenn., stays open.    Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering, a Washington, D.C., law firm, runs an emergency daycare facility that is available when employees' regular care arrangements fall through. America West Airlines of Phoenix, Ariz., screens baby sitters and their homes for its Home Caregivers program and reserves other spaces at a 24-hour facility.    The airline says it attracts high-quality providers by offering travel vouchers and by subsidizing parents' payments.    COSTLY DISABILITY programs lead cities and states to set new limits.    Because laws governing disability pay for public-safety workers are typically liberal, local governments are working harder to assure those employees' health. Massachusetts passed a law late last year requiring newly hired policemen and firemen to be nonsmokers. Los Angeles firefighters hired after last July can't be smokers. Monrovia, Calif., officials say hiring only nonsmoking firemen has cut costs &quot;tremendously.&quot;    Toledo, Ohio, tries to reduce injuries by forbidding firemen to hang on to the back of moving firetrucks. Grand Rapids, Mich., last year began requiring two medical opinions before providing disability pay. &quot;Cities, unlike companies, can't run and move South&quot; to lower their costs, says Richard Posthuma, director of risk management for that city.    MALE DOCTORS continue to earn more than their female counterparts.    A study based on a 1986 survey of 4,000 doctors shows that male physicians earn 30% more per hour than women, the same differential that existed in 1982. Women also achieved their highest earnings earlier in their careers than men, says William Marder, one of the authors and director of the Center for Health Policy Research of the American Medical Association.    Although men saw more patients per week and spent more time on medical activities than women, the study said this could indicate that women spend more time with each patient, that patients more often choose male doctors, or that more women are excluded from patient-referral networks. Also, more male doctors choose private practice, where salaries are higher.    Female physicians' earnings also are affected because many take time off from the profession to have families.    COMPUTER CHECK: The AFL-CIO organizes a computerized data bank to track the performance of individual arbitrators. The system will be based on the case-by-case experience of the federation's member unions. The goal: to help unions avoid mediators with records of being slow to make awards or who unions think didn't fully understand the issues.    BIG BENEFITS: In 1986, employee benefits reached the highest percentage of payroll costs -- 39.3% -- in the past 40 years, says a Chamber of Commerce study. During the early 1980s those costs stayed around 37%, tracking the growth of payroll expenses generally. Including retiree health costs in the survey accounted for only a portion of the increase, chamber officials say.    A SPECIAL WORKSHOP will be offered this week by the Labor Department, the UAW and Pennsylvania officials to help workers at Volkswagen's New Stanton, Pa., plant find new jobs. The facility closes next July; company and union leaders requested the help, the first such program federal officials have sponsored for a specific firm.    COACHING LONGEVITY doesn't seem to determine who wins the Super Bowl, say researchers at Personnel Journal magazine. In 10 of the previous 21 games, the losing coach had been with his team longer than the winner. This year, both Washington coach Joe Gibbs and Denver's Dan Reeves have led those teams for seven years.    A PUSH TO TRIM the federal work force draws complaints.    During budget negotiations with several government departments, the Office of Management and Budget is trying to cut the number of full-time positions it approves for fiscal year 1989. Budget Director James Miller says the White House will stand firm despite complaints because the full-time payroll for nondefense workers has been creeping up of late after some success in cutting those jobs in the early 1980s.    Health and Human Services Secretary Otis Bowen told Miller that the OMB request for new cuts on top of his department's own staff reduction plan removes&quot; incentives for good management practices.&quot; Congressional aides say the departments of Labor, Energy and Interior also are targeted for staff cuts.    Over a million people, nearly half of all federal civil servants excluding postal employees, work for the Pentagon.    THE CHECKOFF: The Bureau of National Affairs will celebrate its new publication &quot;Drug Free Workplace&quot; by serving champagne and high tea at a book-signing party. . . . At Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas Inc., news that job-search clients have found work is celebrated by ringing an old castiron ship's bell near the boss's office. </TEXT></DOC>
