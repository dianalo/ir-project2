Rulemaking Background.</ITAG>MSHA announced the availability of preproposal drafts for the machineryand equipment (Subpart M) and loading, hauling and dumping (Subpart H)standards on February 11, 1983 (48 FR 6489) and April 22, 1983 (48 FR 17513),respectively.After reviewing suggestions and recommendations from mine operators, laborgroups, equipment manufacturers, and other interested parties, MSHA publisheda proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for machinery and equipment on March 6, 1984(49 FR 8375) and a proposed rule for loading, hauling and dumping on December18, 1984 (49 FR 49202). Public hearings were held in June 1984 for themachinery and equipment standards and August 1985 for the loading, hauling,and dumping standards. MSHA received and reviewed written and oral statementson both proposed rules from all segments of the mining community. The finalrule for Subpart M contains more standards than were included in the proposedrule due to the inclusion of standards originally proposed in Subpart H,but which more precisely and appropriately address machinery and equipmentrequirements. Additionally, a new standard addressing restricted clearancefor foot travel on travelways is added to Parts 56 and 57, Subpart J (Travelwaysand Escapeways). The standards in Part 56 apply to all surface metal andnonmetal mines; those in Part 57 apply to underground and surface areasof underground metal and nonmetal mines.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion and Summary of the Final Rule.</ITAG>A. General Discussion.Hazards associated with loading, hauling, and dumping activities and theuse of machinery, equipment, and tools in mining have resulted in manyserious injuries and fatalities. Precautions against these hazards andthe proper use of the equipment involved are essential parts of any effectivemine safety program.Although fatalities and injuries in general have shown a downward trendin metal and nonmetal mines, machinery and equipment-related injuries andfatalities, as a percentage of the total, have been increasing over thepast few years. This trend is, in part, due to increasing mechanizationof the mining industry. During the past two decades, activity in metaland nonmetal mining nationally has shifted from underground to largelysurface mining. This development has resulted in a substantial increasein the number and size of haulage vehicles being used at mine sites. Whileimproving productivity, these changes have also exposed miners to additionalpotential hazards.Accidents related to powered haulage continue to represent a significantportion of the fatalities in metal and nonmetal mines. Transportation accidentsinvolving large equipment tend to result in the most serious types of accidents.Between 1978 and 1987, an average of 76 fatalities and 12,600 nonfatalinjuries occurred annually in metal and nonmetal mines. During this period,fatalities involving powered haulage averaged about 24 annually and nonfatalinjuries involving powered haulage averaged 972 annually.Machinery and equipment accidents were also a significant cause of injuriesand fatalities in mines during this period. An average of 1,675 nonfatalinjuries, and 11 fatalities occurred annually, caused by either accidentalcontact with or misuse of machinery and equipment ranging from small, portablehand tools to large, stationary machinery, crushers and conveyors.MSHA examined fatality reports for the years 1982-1987 to determine projectedbenefits from this final rule for Subparts H and M. Over the last 6 years,the Agency estimates that 127 fatalities could have been prevented by fullcompliance with all the provisions of the final rule. Based on this estimate,MSHA projects that full compliance will result in between 10 and 15 livessaved per year.While increased mechanization has created potential hazards, technologicalimprovements have also created opportunities to ensure a safer workingenvironment for miners. Technological advances aid in reducing hazardsbecause many safeguards are integral design features on new products. Also,improved engineering and work practices in loading, hauling, and dumpingoperations can contribute to enhanced protection of persons working onmining property.These revised standards are intended to improve safety by recognizing andincorporating many of these technological improvements and bringing MSHA'sstandards up-to-date. In addition, standards are included to ensure safetyin areas not previously addressed; but where the data show that accidentsare occurring and duplicative and unnecessary standards are eliminated.MSHA's review of the existing standards and comments received has resultedin revisions to reflect both the Agency's experience and the concerns ofcommenters, including small mine operators. In developing this final rule,MSHA has been responsive, to the extent possible, to the many commentsreceived from the mining public. These changes are consistent with thegoals of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, Executive Order12291, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act,in that the final rule provides new compliance alternatives to accommodateadvances in mining technology while offering the most effective protectionfor persons working at mines.Throughout the rulemaking process a number of commenters expressed concernabout the applicability of individual standards and the relationship ofthe loading, hauling, and dumping standards contained in Subpart H, tothe machinery and equipment standards contained in Subpart M, particularlysince many of the standards in Subpart H address equipment.In drafting the final rule, it became evident that the most logical organizationalapproach would be to realign the standards into ``hazard or task-related''groups within separate subparts. Accordingly, many of the standards whichappeared in the proposed rule for Subpart H have been transferred to SubpartM. The final rule continues to provide the necessary safety for workersat metal and nonmetal mines. Changes made to all of the existing standardsare discussed fully below.The standards that address safe conduct of loading, hauling, and dumpingactivities are contained in Subpart H under the following headings: TrafficSafety; Transportation of Persons and Materials; and Safety Devices, Provisions,and Procedures for Roadways, Railroads, and Loading and Dumping Sites.The standards contained in Subpart M address: Safety Devices and MaintenanceRequirements; and Safety Practices and Operational Procedures for varioustypes of machinery and equipment, including those used in loading, haulingand dumping activities. Standards for Subpart H and Subpart M are publishedtogether in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for the convenience of readers to assist thenin understanding the realignment of the standards and to clarify the relationshipbetween Subpart H and Subpart M.The Agency believes this realignment of standards and restructuring ofsubcategories will aid in clarifying the intent of each standard and willhelp users locate the various standards within the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR).B.

Standard 56/57.9042 whichrequires that rocker-bottom and bottom-dump railcars be equipped with lockingdevices is deleted because these type railcars do not operate without lockingdevices. Standard 57.9114, which requires the designation of dischargeand boarding points where mantrips are used, is deleted because final standard56/57.9318 addresses the hazard of getting on or off moving equipment.Standard 56/57.14009 which addresses grinding wheels is also deleted becausethe hazard of operating such devices is covered by final standard 56/57.14205,which requires that equipment be used within the manufacturer's specificationsand instructions unless no hazard to persons is created. Standard 56/57.14027,which requires that competent persons be assigned to the operation of machineryor equipment is deleted because the training requirements in 30 CFR Part48 cover the competency of persons operating machinery or equipment.C. Other Changes.The final rule includes a new andSection; 56/57.11008 for Subpart J (Travelwaysand Escapeways). The standard addresses restricted clearances encounteredby persons traveling on foot. The standard is added in response to severalcommenters who urged that existing andSection; 56/57.9060, addressing restrictedoverhead clearance hazards in general, be limited to situations where personsare traveling in mobile equipment. The proposal suggested the restrictedclearance areas be conspicuously marked where a hazard is created. However,commenters believed the standard should only apply where the restrictedclearance creates a hazard to persons on travelways. MSHA agrees with commenterswho stated that, without this limitation to travelways, a multitude ofother restricted clearance locations might unnecessarily have to be marked.Commenters also opposed having the standard specify how the area shouldbe marked. In this instance, the primary compliance action relates to alertingpersons to hazards presented by restricted clearnces. Under this finalrule, where marking is required, and method of conspicuous marking alertingpersons would be permitted. Restricted clearances that create hazards topersons on mobile equipment are addressed in final andSection; 56/57.9306.The provisions of existing andSection; 56/57.14014 addressing eye protectionwhile using grinding wheels is a ``personal protection'' standard whichthe Agency has determined would be more appropriately grouped with otherpersonal protection standards for metal and nonmetal miners. The finalrule redesignates andSection; 56/57.14014 as andSection; 56/57.15014 in SubpartN. No changes have been made in the requirements of the standard.D. Petitions for Modification.Operators with petitions for modification that involve the standards revisedin this rulemaking need to determine the status of those petitions beforethe effective date of this final rule. If there are sections of this rulewhich are renumbered but remain substantively unchanged from the existingstandards, operators with modifications granted for these standards neednot reapply. However, operators with modifications granted for standardsthat have been revised will need to comply with the new rule on its effectivedate. New petitions for modification of the final rule may be submittedin accordance with 30 CFR Part 44. If Agency assistance is needed, questionsshould be directed to the appropriate MSHA District Office.E. Definitions.Subpart H contains two defined terms: <T3>Berm </T3>and <T3>mobile equipment</T3>. Subpart M also contains two defined terms: <T3>Mobile equipment</T3>, and <T3>travelway</T3>. In the proposed rule for Subpart H, <T3>berm </T3>was defined as ``A pile or mound of material along an elevatedroadway capable of moderating or limiting the force of a vehicle in orderto impede the vehicle's passage over the bank of the roadway.'' Commenterssupported this definition which is retained in the final rule.Several commenters suggested clarification of the proposed rule's definitionsfor mobile and self-propelled equipment. In the proposed rule for SubpartH, mobile equipment was defined as ``equipment capable of moving or beingmoved readily,'' and self-propelled equipment as ``equipment capable ofmoving itself.'' Both subparts now define <T3>mobile equipment</T3> as ``wheeled, skid-mounted, track-mounted, orrail-mounted equipment capable of moving or being moved.'' Wherever thefinal rule refers to equipment capable of moving itself, it uses the term<T3>self-propelled mobile equipment</T3>, for which a separate definitionis not necessary.The definition of <T3>travelway </T3>has been revised in Subpart M to include ``a passage,walk, or way regularly used or designated for persons to go from one placeto another.'' This revision recognizes that walkways that are regularlyused, in addition to those which are designated, are also included withinthe scope of the safety standards.<T3>Mantrip</T3>, as proposed in Subpart H, has been deleted from the finalrule because commenters indicated that mantrip is a readily understoodmining term. Likewise, <T3>trip light </T3>has been deleted since it is also fully recognizedand understood within the affected mining community.F. Incorporations by Reference.Subpart H does not contain any incorporations by reference. Subpart M containstwo standards which incorporate by reference national consensus standards:andSection; 56/57.14130, which addresses roll-over protective structures(ROPS) and seat belts, and andSection; 56/57.14131, which requires the useof seat belts on certain equipment which is not fitted with ROPS. Theseincorporations by reference were approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and are discussed in detail in the section-by-sectionanalysis, below.G. Section-by-Section Discussion of Subpart H.The following section-by-section analysis discusses the issues raised duringthis rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">Traffic Safety</ITAG><T3>Section 56/57.9100 Traffic control. </T3>This standard revises existingandSection; 56/57.9071. It requires the establishment and posting of trafficsafety rules, signs and signals. The standard provides for the safe operationof self-propelled mobile equipment. The final rule clarifies several provisionsof the proposal and expands the scope of the required traffic safety rules.The failure to establish traffic rules and post warning signs has beencited as a contributing factor in mining accidents. Fatalities have occurredwhere rules governing direction of equipment movement were not establishedand where signs warning of hazardous curves and steep declines were notprovided.The final standard contains two requirements. Under paragraph (a) eachmine is required to establish and follow traffic rules governing equipmentspeed, right-of-way, direction of movement and the use of headlights. Thelatter requirement is added to emphasize the importance of using lightswhere necessary to prevent collisions and other hazards associated withoperating self-propelled mobile equipment in conditions of limited visibility.The requirement is compatible with and a logical extension of the requirementin andSection; 56/57.9101 that operating speeds be consistent with visibility.Paragraph (b) requires that warning signs or signals be placed at appropriatelocations in order to alert equipment operators of the need to take appropriateprecautions. For example, a sign warning the equipment operator to checka vehicle's brakes and use a low gear may be needed in advance of a steepdecline.Commenters stated that the proposal's provision for traffic rules to beposted was impractical for some mining operations since rules can changeas often as each shift. MSHA agrees that this situation can exist at somemines, and the final rule deletes the posting requirement for rules but,not warning signs. However, rules would have to be established at the minefor miners' training and awareness.Commenters also asked whether the standard would require an increase inthe number of signs already required. The final rule does not require additionalsigns to be installed. However, it does require that the signs ``warn ofhazardous conditions''. A second concern was the proposal's provision thateach sign be uniform in size and shape for each purpose. Several commentersbelieved this provision was inappropriate since low clearances may sometimesmake uniformity impossible, particularly underground. Commenters also statedthat larger signs may be needed in some situations. MSHA agrees that whilestandardization may enhance warning recognition, compliance may be difficultin some situations; therefore, the final rule deletes the uniformity requirement.Some commenters questioned the phrase ``appropriate locations on roadways''and were not sure where signs or signals would be required. The final ruleclarifies that signs or signals are required to be positioned so that hazardousconditions are known in advance. For example, signs must be appropriatelyplaced to warn drivers of hazards which they are approaching, such as intersections,steep grades, and sharp turns.Commenters also questioned the scope of the standard as it relates to undergroundoperations. As with the existing standard, the final rule applies to surfaceas well as underground locations since traffic control hazards exist inboth situations. While MSHA realizes that rules of the road and signs mayhave to be different to accommodate confined environments, they must appropriatelyaddress underground hazards.<T3>Section 56/57.9101 Operating speeds and control of equipment. </T3>Thisstandard revises and consolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9017,56/57.9023, 56/57.9024, and 57.9113 which address equipment speed and control.The final rule requires that operators of self-propelled mobile equipmentmaintain control of equipment while it is in motion. It also requires thatoperating speeds be consistent with conditions of the roadway or tracks,other traffic, visibility and the type of equipment used. Commenters supportedthis consolidation and the final rule retains the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9102 Movement of independently operating rail equipment.</T3>This standard revises existing andSection; 56/57.9035. To prevent collisionof independently operated trains, the final rule requires that movementof two or more pieces of rail equipment operating independently on thesame track be controlled for safe operation.A commenter recommended that the standard permit ``control for safe operation''to be achieved by either an equipment operator or a safety device. Forclarification, operators can use either approach as long as safety is achieved.Some examples of control methods are: Train dispatchers using electronicswitchboards; block light systems; flagmen and switchmen.The final rule retains the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9103 Clearance on adjacent tracks. </T3>This standardrevised existing andSection;56/57.9050. It prohibits the parking of railcarson side tracks unless clearance is provided for traffic on adjacent tracksto pass by. No comments were received on this standard as proposed, andthe final rule clarifies the proposed language to explain that clearanceis needed in order for traffic to pass.<T3>Section 56/57.9104 Railroad crossings. </T3>This standard revises existingandSection; 56/57.9059. The final rule requires that designated railroadcrossings be posted with warning signs or signals or, as an alternative,guarded when trains are passing. For example, brakemen and switchmen canguard crossings in lieu of installing signs, as long as the goal of warningworkers is achieved. The final rule retains the requirement that crossingpoints be planked or filled between the rails.Some commenters believed this standard should only apply to surface railequipment. These commenters were concerned that MSHA could require theentire length of underground rails to be planked or filled since personsoften use the rails as travelways. The final standard continues to applyto both surface and underground locations since the hazards exist in eithersituation. However, the final rule clarifies that the standard appliesonly to those ``designated'' locations where persons or equipment crossthe tracks. It also deletes the proposal's reference to ``permanent'' crossingssince the appropriate consideration is whether the location is a designatedcrossing point.<T3>Section 57.9160 Train movement during shift changes. </T3>This standardrevises existing andSection;57.9116 which applies to underground areas ofunderground mines. Pedestrian traffic increases considerably in most trackhaulage areas during shift changes. Therefore, at those times, the finalrule requires that production train travel be limited to areas where pedestriantraffic is not affected.A commenter believed that the standard should be expanded to include personswho are exposed to rail or truck haulage traffic at open pit operations.However, the final rule retains the scope of the existing standard becauseunderground operations generally have limited areas for persons to escapefrom moving equipment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Transportation of Persons and Materials</ITAG><T3>Section 56/57.9200 Transporting persons. </T3>This standard revisesand consolidates existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9040, 56/57.9041, 56/57.9067,and 56/57.9085. Each of these standards involve safety practices relatedto transporting persons on mobile equipment. Commenters supported the consolidationof these standards; however, the final rule modifies the proposal in severalrespects as discussed below.In the proposal, paragraph (a) would have prohibited transporting personsin or on dippers, forks, clamshells, or buckets. Commenters requested thatMSHA include the provision contained in existing andSection;56/57.9049 whichpermits persons to be transported in shaft buckets under limited circumstances.MSHA agrees and the final rule allows persons to be transported in shaftbuckets during shaft-sinking operations, or during inspection, maintenance,and repair of shafts. Several commenters questioned whether paragraph (a)would prevent persons from working from raised platforms. The final ruleaddresses dippers, forks, clamshells and buckets, not raised platforms.However, raised platforms are discussed in Subpart M, andSection;andSection;56/57.14211,which addresses equipment in a raised position and the use of mobile workplatforms.Paragraph (b) of the proposal prohibited transporting persons in beds ofmobile equipment or railcars unless they were seated and provisions weremade for secure travel. Paragraph (f) of the proposal addressed the relatedaspect of transporting persons in moblile equipment provided with unloadingdevices unless provisions were made to prevent accidental starting of theunloading devices. Commenters suggested that these related paragraphs becombined and the final rule for paragraph (b) reflects this consolidation.Commenters questioned whether paragraph (b) would always require personsto be seated, even if provisions were made for their secure travel. Forexample, they cited instances of persons being safely transported whilestanding on platforms attached to the rear of mobile equipment. MSHA doesnot believe that it is always necessary for persons to be seated, so longas provisions are made for secure travel. Therefore, the final rule forparagraph (b) deletes the requirement for persons to be seated; dependingupon the situation, ``secure travel'' may require that persons be seatedor that other precautions be taken.Paragraph (c) prohibits the transportation of persons on top of loads inmobil equipment. Except for an editorial change substituting the words``loads in'' for ``loaded,'' the final rule for paragraph (c) is the sameas the proposal. Paragraph (d) prohibits transporting persons on the outside of cabs, equipmentoperators' stations, or beds of mobil equipment except when necessary formaintenance, testing, or training purposes. Some commenters were concernedthat the proposal's use of the term ``equipment operators' stations'' couldprohibit the transportation of persons in cabs that are designed to accommodatemore than just the operator of the equipment. MSHA did not intend to restrictthe use of such cabs, and the final rule includes the term ``cabs'' toremove any ambiguity. As with the proposal, paragraph (d) of the finalrule retains the exclusion of rail equipment. Paragraph (e), with certain exceptions, prohibits persons from riding inlocations on trains and locomotives which expose them to hazards from trainmovement. The proposal prohibited all persons from riding in hazardouslocations on trains. Many commenters objected to the scope of this prohibition,stating that there was no basis to conclude that riding between railcarswas hazardous. During the past two years, MSHA has reviewed 6 fatalityreports involving persons who rode between railcars of trains, and on theleading end of trains or railcars. These victims were performing train-relatedwork duties, such as car dropping, at the time of the fatal occurrences.In nearly every instance, the use of a safety belt and line may have avoidedthe fatality. Commenters agreed that use of safety belt and line duringcar dropping eliminates the hazard of persons falling off the platformand being run over by a train. Therefore, paragraph (e) allows car droppersto ride on the leading end of trains as long as they are secured with asafety belt and line which will prevent them from falling off the workplatform. Further, commenters were concerned that paragraph (e) would prohibitgravity dropping of railcars. The final rule does not prohibit gravitydropping, which is the practice of using gravity forces and braking powerto reposition cars, rather than locomotive power. Commenters also pointedout that car droppers will at times be on the leading end of a railcarsince the brake wheel and platform will come on to the line on the car'sleading end about half of the time. During car dropping, a person mustbe at the end of the railcar that has the brake wheel and platform in orderto control the railcar being dropped. The final rule for paragraph (e) specifically addresses brakemen who typicallyhave duties such as coupling and uncoupling cars, throwing switches, settingmechanical brakes on uncoupled cars, and giving signals to the engineer.Such duties may require these workers to be in locations between railcars.It also addresses trainmen who typically run the locomotive with a remotecontrol device; go from one end of the train to the other; and, in someinstances, must leave the train in order to arrange for the loading ofcars. The final rule allows these workers to take actions necessary toperform their work functions, but specifically prohibits them from ridingbetween cars of moving trains. Commenters agreed with MSHA that when personsare being transported on trains, there should be strict adherence to thestandard's prohibited riding locations.   Paragraph (f) prohibits transportation of persons in overcrowded mobileequipment. Equipment is determined to be ``overcrowded'' when the stabilityof the equipment is affected or the presence of persons would interferewith the driver's ability to safely operate the controls. The final ruleretains the proposed language.  Paragraph (g) of the final rule prohibits transporting persons in mobileequipment with materials or equipment, unless those items are secured.Several commenters believed the standard should exempt small items thatcan be hand-carried, such as lunch boxes and mechanic's tools. Other commenterswere concerned that if MSHA permitted such an exception, items that couldpose a hazard due to their size or weight, such as mining bars and drillsteel, could be construed as ``hand-carried'' items. The final rule addressesthese concerns and permits small hand tools or other items to be hand-carriedin mobile equipment if a hazard to persons is not created. Items such asmining bars or drill steel could pose hazards to persons and, therefore,would not be permitted in mobile equipment when persons are being transportedunless they are secured.  Editorially, paragraph (h) of the proposal has become paragraph (g) ofthe final rule because of the consolidation of paragraph (b) and (f) inthe final rule.  Paragraph (h) of the final rule is derived from existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9014. It appeared in the proposal for Subpart M (Machinery and Equipment)and addressed the hazard of persons riding on conveyors that are used totransport material or supplies. With the reorganization of standards, ithas been retained in this subpart. Paragraph (h) prohibits persons fromriding on conveyors unless the conveyors are designed to safely transportpersons.  <T3>Section 56/57.9201 Loading, hauling, and unloading of equipment andsupplies. </T3>This standard revises existing andSection; 56/57.9045 whichaddresses the hazard of equipment and supplies falling or shifting duringthe process of loading, transporting, and unloading. The final rule requiresthat each of these procedures be performed in a manner which does not createa falling or shifting hazard that could injure persons.  Commenters questioned whether the standard could be interpreted as requiringall loads to be physically secured without regard to the presence of ahazard. For example, unsecured items are often transported in the bedsof pickup trucks without posing a hazard to persons in the truck's cabor to other persons. Under the final rule, loads do not have to be securedif a hazard to persons does not exist.  Commenters also asked if the standard would prohibit dropping loads whenthat is the customary method of unloading a particular item. The finalrule would permit this activity, so long as it did not create a hazardto persons. <T3>Section 56/57.9202 Loading and hauling large rocks. </T3>This standardconsolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9034 and 56/57.9062. Thefinal rule prohibits loading rocks in haulage vehicles when the rocks aretoo large to be handled safely. It also requires that when mobile equipmentis used to haul mined material, the equipment must be loaded to minimizespillage where a hazard to persons could be created. In addition to creatinga hazard to foot traffic, the spillage could also create a hazard to othervehicle operators.Some commenters stated that the standard should apply only where persons``will'' be endangered if rocks are not broken before loading. However,in order to prevent hazards from developing, MSHA believes that it is importantto require that large rocks be broken prior to loading if their size couldendanger persons or affect the stability of equipment. Several fatalitieshave resulted from equipment being overturned by rocks too large for theequipment.As pointed out by commenters, the size of the equipment picking up or transportingthe rock, and the size, weight, and shape of the rock are factors involvedin determining whether a hazard will be created. Due to these highly variablefactors, the standard is written to ensure that vehicles of appropriatesize and design will be used, or that the rock is reduced to an appropriatesize for the vehicle involved.Some commenters, referring to the provision for minimizing spillage, believedthat the standard should also require that loaded materials be centered.However, MSHA agrees with those commenters who noted that while operatorsnormally attempt to center loads, a requirement to do so in all instanceswould be impractical given the methods typically used to load mined material.While it is impossible to prevent total spillage, the standard requiresoperators to take all reasonable actions to minimize spillage of material.<T3>Section 57.9260 Supplies, materials, and tools on mantrips. </T3>Thisstandard revises existing andSection; 57.9099 and applies to undergroundoperations. It prohibits the transportation of supplies, materials, andtools (except small hand tools that can be carried without creating a hazard)with persons in mantrips. It also specifies that mantrips must be operatedindependently of ore and supply trips. No comments were received on thisstandard as proposed, and the final rule clarifies the proposed languageon small hand tools.<T3>Section 57.9261 Transporting tools and materials on locomotives. </T3>Thisstandard revises existing andSection; 57.9096 and applies to undergroundmining operations. The standard prohibits the transportation of materialson top of locomotives because of the potential hazards to the train operatorand miners. Derailing devices are exempted from the prohibition providedthey are properly located and secured. No comments were received on thisstandard as proposed, and the final rule retains the proposed language.<ITAG tagnum="81">Safety Devices, Provisions, and Procedures for Roadways, Railroads,and Loading and Dumping Sites</ITAG><T3>Section 56/57.9300 Berms or guardrails. </T3>This standard revisesexisting andSection;andSection; 56/57.9022 which addresses berms. The finalrule requires berms or guardrails to be provided and maintained on thebanks of roadways where a drop-off exists which is of sufficient gradeor depth to cause a vehicle to overturn or endanger persons in equipment.The final rule also includes a height requirement for berms and guardrails.While evaluating hazards presented by different types of roadways, MSHAidentified over 90 fatalities occurring between 1969 and 1984 on haulage,service, and access roadways where a berm could have minimized the seriousnessof the accident resulting from an out-of-control vehicle. In all documentedinstances, the roadway had a drop-off sufficient to cause equipment tooverturn or otherwise endanger persons riding in the vehicle.The existing berm standard applied to all elevated roadways, regardlessof their function or frequency of use. Commenters questioned both the scopeand nature of the berm provision. Many commenters believed that, undercertain circumstances, the Agency should permit alternatives to the installationof berms or guardrails. Other commenters took the position that berms orguardrails should only be required on roadways that are used to haul themine's ore and waste products. Others believed that infrequently traveledsecondary roadways which are only used by small service or maintenanceequipment, should be exempt from the standard. However, all of these commentersagreed that if certain roadways were exempted, alternative methods wouldbe necessary to protect equipment operators on such roadways. MSHA hasprovided an option for those infrequently traveled roadways which are traveledonly by service and maintenance vehicles.MSHA discussed this issue in its public hearing notice published on July3, 1985 (50 FR 27568), and outlined criteria to be followed should an alternativecompliance method be permitted for infrequently traveled roadways whichare only used by service or maintenance equipment. The Agency receivedpublic comment and testimony and agrees that an alternative to berms orguardrails on infrequently traveled roadways is appropriate and will providenecessary protection for workers. Under the final rule, berms or guardrailsare not required for infrequently traveled roadways used only by serviceor maintenance vehicles. For those roadways, the final rule includes analternative compliance method. Specifically, locked gates, warning signs,reflectors along the roadway's perimeter, and controlled speeds would haveto be used where a berm or guardrail is not installed. These roadways cannotbe traveled when traction is impaired by the presence of sleet or snowunless corrective measures are taken to improve the traction. All of thesecriteria must be met to diminish the likelihood of equipment going overthe bank of an elevated roadway. MSHA believes that many service and secondaryroadways, such as tailings dam roads can effectively use this alternativecompliance method.Some commenters also urged MSHA to exempt roadways that are under construction.However, during construction there is frequent use of the roadways, posingcontinual exposure to hazardous dropoffs. In these instances, the installationof the berm or guardrail should concurrently proceed with road construction.Since these roadways are in constant use and drop-off hazards exist, thealternative compliance method would not be effective. After construction,depending on the type and frequency of vehicles that use the roadway, bermsor guardrails may be required or the alternative method may be used forroads used by service and maintenance vehicles.Some commenters asked that MSHA explain the basis for requiring berms andguardrails to be mid-axle height of the largest self-propelled equipmentwhich usually travels the roadway. Mid-axle height is the minimum heightneeded to (1) ensure under-carriage contact with the restraint, (2) alertthe equipment operator of the hazardous situation, (3) moderate the forceof the equipment, (4) provide time for corrective action, and (5) assistthe operator in regaining control of the equipment. Studies have shownthat berms or guardrails less than mid-axle height are not capable of limitingthe force of the equipment or impeding passage over the bank of the elevatedroadway. There were no adverse comments regarding the mid-axle requirement.(See Bureau of Mines Information Circular No. 8758, 1977). Where bermsor guardrails are required, the final rule requires that they be at leastmid-axle height of the largest self-propelled equipment which ususallytravels the roadway. Therefore, the height of the berm would not need tobe increased where equipment with greater mid-axle height infrequentlytravels the roadway.Some commenters were concerned that berms could cause pools of water tobe created along roadways which could affect the structual integrity ofroads, particularly on tailings dams. MSHA realizes that water accumulationcan be a problem, and the final rule permits openings along bermed areasto the extent necessary for roadway drainage.<T3>Section 56/57.9301 Dump site restraints.</T3> This standard revisesexisting andSection;andSection;56/57.9054 which requires that berms, bumperblocks, safety hooks, or similar means be provided at dumping locationsto prevent overtravel and overturning of mobile equipment.Several commenters believed that the proposal's use of the words ``restrain''and ``prevent'' was vague, and pointed out that the devices may not preventequipment from overtravel or overturning in all cases. MSHA agrees thatthese devices may not provide an absolute barrier. They do, however, providea restraint or impedance in the form of a physical obstruction to overtravelat the dump site. The final rule clarifies that these devices are intendedto impede overtravel or overturning.Some commenters also suggested that truck spotters be allowed as an alternativeto using impeding devices. While the final rule does not prohibit usingtruck spotters in conjunction with these devices, truck spotters aloneare not permitted. Truck spotters would not be able to provide an equivalentmeans of protection since they may not always be visible to the truck driver,nor can they provide the physical resistance that an impeding device canoffer. Procedures for truck spotters are addressed in andSection;andSection;56/57.9305.<T3>Section 56/57.9302 Protection against moving or runaway railroad equipment.</T3>This standard revises and consolidates existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9020and 56/57.9056. The final rule requires the installation of stopblocks,derail devices, or other equivalent devices where they are necessary toprotect persons from moving or runaway railroad equipment.A commenter believed that the proposal's requirements were vague, opento interpretation, and that these deivices should be installed in accordancewith the American Railway Enginering Association (A.R.E.A.) standards.MSHA has reviewed the A.R.E.A. recommended practices, and the final ruleis consistant with them. Both the A.R.E.A. standards and MSHA's final rulerecognize the diversity of conditions at mining operations and allow mineoperators to independently assess their particular conditions when determiningwhich type of device is appropriate. At surface mines, these protectivedevices are necessary where rail equipment enters work areas such as repairshops and at railcar storage areas in the proximity of work or travel sites.In underground mines, these devices provide protection against overtravelat shaft collars, level landings, and rail car storage areas where equipmentor material is loaded or unloaded near work or travel sites. The finalrule does not change the wording of the proposal.<T3>Section 56/57.9303 Construction of ramps and dumping facilities.</T3>This standard revises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9063. The finalrule requires that ramps and dumping facilities be constructed of materialsthat are capable of supporting the loads to which they will be subjected.These ramps and dumping facilities must also provide adequate width, clearance,and headroom to safely accommodate the equipment using the facilities.No comments were received on this standard as proposed and the final ruleeditorially clarifies the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9304 Unstable ground.</T3> This standard clarifies theprovisions of existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9055 which addresses thehazard of unstable ground at dumping locations. The final rule requiresthat dumping locations be inspected prior to work commencing, and as groundconditions warrant. It also provides for actions to be taken when thereis evidence that the ground at a dumping location may fail.MSHA stated in the preamble to the proposed rule that the standard wouldrequire periodic examination of dumping locations for signs of instability.Some commenters believed the standard should expressly include this examinationrequirement whereas others were opposed to such a requirement. The finalrule includes a requirement to visually inspect dumping locations priorto work commencing and thereafter as ground conditions warrant. Numerousaccidents have occurred when dumping locations deteriorate and become unableto support the weight of the equipment using them. Therefore, the finalrule also requires that where there is evidence that the ground at a dumpinglocation may fail to support the equipment, loads are to be dumped a safedistance away from the edge of the unstable area of the bank.<T3>Section 56/57.9305 Truck spotters.</T3> This standard revises existingandSection;andSection;56/57.9058 which establishes safety procedures to befollowed when truck spotters are used for guiding trucks during dumping.No comments were received on this standard as proposed and the final rulemakes grammatical changes to the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9306 Warning devices for restricted clearances.</T3>This standard revises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9060 and 56/57.9104.The final rule addresses instances where restricted clearance creates ahazard to persons on mobile equipment, and requires that a warning devicebe installed in advance of the restricted area and the area be conspicuouslymarked.Commenters suggested that the standard be limited to restricted clearancesalong roadways and that rail equipment be excluded from its scope on thebasis that proposed andSection;andSection;56/57.9330 covered those hazards.MSHA agrees that the standard should be limited to roadways since it wouldbe impractical to anticipate and mark every off-road location that hasa restricted clearance. However, rail equipment is retained in this standardbecause andSection;andSection;56/57.9330 applies only to side clearance andis limited to surface equipment. In addition, andSection;andSection;56/57.9330does not require an advance warning device, and marking is only requiredwhere the minimum side clearance cannot be met at surface operations. Similarly,although commenters suggested that new andSection;andSection;56/57.11008 couldadequately address restricted clearances, that standard pertains only topedestrian exposure to these hazards.<T3>Section 56/57.9307 Design, installation, and maintenance of railroads.</T3>This standard revises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9016. The finalrule requires that road beds and all elements of the railroad track bedesigned, installed, and maintained to prevent accidents and injuries whichcould result when rail equipment is operated at speeds too fast for thecondition of the tracks. Trackage elements include such items as rails,joints, switches, and frogs. The proposed rule included the reference whichlimited the standard's application to trackage elements ``subject to thecontrol of the mine operator''. The Agency recognizes that these type ofjurisdictional issues are sometimes addressed when citations are litigated.Matters of jurisdiction are not, however, at issue in the development ofsafety and health standards for miners. Therefore, the phrase has beendeleted from the final rule. MSHA will examine the circumstances to determinewho is responsible for correction of the violation.<T3>Section 56/57.9308 Switch throws.</T3> This standard revises existingandSection;andSection;56/57.9028 which requires that switch throws be installedto protect switchmen from contact with moving trains. No comments werereceived on the standard as proposed and the final rule retains the proposedlanguage.<T3>Section 56/57.9309 Chute design.</T3> This standard revised existingandSection;andSection;56/57.9064 which requires that chute-loading installationsbe designed so that a person is placed in a safe location while ``pulling''a chute. A safe location is needed to prevent the chute puller from eitherbeing struck by material that is being loaded, or by the vehicle involved.No comments were received on this standard as proposed and the final ruleeditorially clarifies the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9310 Chute hazards. </T3>This standard consolidates andrevises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9072, 57.9105, and 57.9106. Eachof these standards address hazards such as uncontrolled rock movement andimproper use of tools to free lodged material in chutes.Paragraph (a) requires that prior to chute-pulling, persons who may beaffected by the draw, or otherwise exposed to danger, must be warned andgiven time to clear the hazardous area. A commenter was concerned thatparagraph (a) would prohibit persons from working on grizzlies above thechute during chute-pulling even if they were secured with a safety line.Persons working above the chute who are using safety lines would not beaffected by the draw; therefore, the requirements of paragraph (a) wouldnot apply in those situations.Paragraph (b) addresses safety practices for persons attempting to freechute hangups. Commenters stated that the proposal's reference to ``barringdown'' material did not fully describe all the methods used to dislodgechute hangups. MSHA agrees, and the final rule requires that proper toolsbe used to free material. Another commenter believed that paragraph (b)should retain the existing standard's requirement that persons attemptingto free hangups be experienced and understand the hazards involved. MSHAagrees that this work is extremely hazardous and has revised paragraph(b) of the standard to include experience and knowledge requirements.Some commenters believed that the term ``chute'' was not descriptive ofequipment found in some surface operations. For example, some surface operationsplace material in bins and stockpiles and then draw from the under portionthrough feeders. MSHA's use of ``chute'' in the final rule is intendedas a general term to include draw points, feeders or gates, each of whichserve the common purpose of providing an extraction point mechanism forthe transfer of muck or material. The final rule would cover surface binsand stockpiles from which material is drawn.Paragraph (c) requires that empty chutes be either equipped with guardsto contain flying rock or material prior to dumping broken rock or material,or that persons be isolated from the hazards of flying rock or material.A commenter recommended that paragraph (c) be deleted from the standard,stating it had no application to surface operations. The final rule retainsthis requirement because many surface stone operations use these type ofchutes.<T3>Section 56/57.9311 Anchoring stationary sizing devices.</T3>This standardeditorially revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9057 which requiresthat grizzlies and other stationary sizing devices be securely anchored.A commenter asked whether this standard would prohibit use of grizzliesor grates that can be pivoted or raised to allow for cleaning. As longas the structure itself remains securely anchored, the final rule wouldallow use of a hinge feature to permit cleaning.<T3>Section 56/57.9312 Working around drawholes. </T3>This standard revisesexising andSection;57.9107 which prohibits persons from standing over drawholesif there is danger that material may be withdrawn or may collapse unlessplatforms or safety lines are used. No comments were received on this standardas proposed and the final rule retains the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9313 Roadway maintenance. </T3>This standard was consideredfor deletion in the proposed rule. The Agency originally believed thattwo other existing standards adequately addressed these roadway maintenancehazards andSection;andSection;56/57.4050, which prohibits the accumulationof waste materials in quantities that could create a fire hazard; and andSection;andSection;56/57.20003,which requires that workplaces, passageways and rooms be kept clean andorderly. However, some commenters requested that MSHA retain and reviseexisting andSection;andSection;56/57.9053 because the hazard presented by theaccumulation of water, debris, and spilled material on roadways in a loading,hauling, and dumping environment is not adequately addressed by eitherof these existing standards.In response to this concern, MSHA reviewed 207 accidents associated withthese hazards and found 43 haulage accidents which resulted from roughroadways, extended pools of roadway water, and spilled haulage material.In a study ``MSHA Analysis of Underground Load, Haul, Dump Accidents''which addressed the cause of accidents that occurred from 1978 through1980, rough roadways or roadway debris was a contributing factor in twentypercent of the accidents occurring during that period. Based on this information,the standard has been retained. Editorially, the standard has been revisedto clarify that it applies to instances where water, debris, or spilledmaterial on roadways creates a hazard to the operation of mobile equipment.<T3>Section 56/57.9314 Trimming of stockpile and muckpile faces. </T3>Thisstandard makes editorial changes to existing andSection;57.9061 which requiresthat stockpile and muckpile faces be trimmed to prevent hazards to persons.Some commenters suggested as an alternative method ``that MSHA allow stockpileand muckpile faces to be either guarded or barricaded and posted untilthe hazard is removed''. The final rule does not permit guarding, barricading,or posting as an alternative because the suggested language would allowthe hazardous condition to exist indefinitely since stockpiles and muckpilesare used on a regular basis in the mining cycle. In addition, workers whoare required to be in the immediate area above and below these stockpilesand muckpiles on a regular basis would not be provided with protection.<T3>Section 56/57.9315 Dust control. </T3>This standard clarifies and revisesexisting andSection;andSection;56/57.9074 which requires dust control at muckpiles, material transfer points, crushers, and on haulage roads where hazardsto persons may be created as a result of impaired visibility. Some commenters believed that the requirement to control dust where hazards``may'' be created was too speculative, and suggested that the standardtake effect when hazards ``are'' or ``will be'' created. MSHA agrees that``may'' could be construed as being too speculative. In MSHA's view, tobe effective, dust control measures must be instituted before the hazardto persons is created. Therefore, the final rule uses the term ``would''.<T3>Section 56/57.9316 Notifying the equipment operator. </T3>This standardrevises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9027. It requires persons to notifythe operator of self-propelled mobile equipment before getting on or offthat equipment when the operator is present. The intent of the standardis to prevent serious injuries from occurring because equipment operatorsare unaware of the presence of persons near the equipment who intend toor attempt to get on or off it. The final rule retains the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9317 Suspended loads. </T3>This standard revises existingandSection;andSection;56/57.9030 which prohibits persons from working or passingunder the buckets or booms of loaders in operation. No comments were receivedon this standard and the final rule retains the proposed language. <T3>Section 56/57.9318 Getting on or off moving equipment. </T3>This standardrevises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9039 which prohibits persons fromgetting on or off moving mobile equipment. The proposal included an exceptionfor trainmen who, because of their work duties, are required to get onand off slowly moving trains. Commenters requested that brakemen and cardroppers also be exempt because their work duties entail getting off slowlymoving trains. MSHA agrees, and the final rule clarifies that trainmen,brakemen, and car droppers are permitted to get on or off slowly movingtrains in the performance of their work duties. <T3>Section 56/57.9319 Going over, under, or between railcars. </T3>Thisstandard revises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9051 which establishessafety practices to be followed to prevent persons from being accidentallyrun over by the sudden movement of railcars. No comments were receivedon this standard as proposed and the final rule retains the proposed language.<T3>Section 56/57.9330 Clearance for surface equipment. </T3>This standardmakes editorial changes to existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9083. It isapplicable to surface mines and surface areas of underground mines. Itrequires that where possible, at least 30 inches of continuous clearancefrom the farthest projection of moving railroad equipment be maintainedon at least one side of the railroad tracks at surface installations. This30-inch clearance is necessary to protect persons who work or travel alonghaulageways from the hazards of moving railroad equipment. Places thatare less than 30 inches must be conspicuously marked. No comments werereceived on this standard as proposed and the final rule retains the proposedlanguage. <T3>Section 57.9360 Shelter holes. </T3>This standard consolidates andclarifies the requirements of existing andSection;andSection;57.9110 and 57.9111.The final rule requires that when continuous clearance of at least 30 inchescannot be maintained on at least one side of underground haulageways, shelterholes be provided at intervals which are adequate to assure the safetyof persons along the haulageway. In response to comments, the standardprovides that only areas having less than 30 inches of continuous clearanceneed to be evaluated, since the critical concern is access to a safe clearancearea. For example, a commenter described a situation where 90 percent ofan underground haulageway had at least 30 inches of clearance. To complywith the final rule, the mine operator would need to evaluate only thearea where the minimum clearance could not be maintained and determinethe distance to the nearest area that has the minimum 30-inch clearance.Where it would be questionable if persons can safely reach adequate clearanceareas, shelter holes would need to be constructed. However, in most instancesMSHA does not believe that additional shelter holes will need to be constructedto comply with the final rule. Several commenters raised issues concerning the prohibition on using shelterholes for storage. They believed that as long as the minimum clearancewas maintained, storage should be permitted. Other commenters supportedthe ban on storage and other uses. MSHA agrees with those commenters whonoted that the critical factor is maintaining the minimum clearance. Therefore,the final rule allows shelter holes to be used for storage as long as theminimum clearance of 40 inches from the farthest projection of moving equipmentis strictly maintained. This approach is consistent with the existing requirement,and avoids the need for the construction of additional storage facilitieswhich may have been required under the proposal. <T3>Section 57.9361 Drawholes. </T3>This standard clarifies existing andSection;57.9103which requires that collars of open drawholes underground be kept freeof muck or material. Some commenters believed that it is impractical to keep drawholes freeof material when normal practice calls for continuous or intermittent flowof materials. The accumulation of material around the collars of drawholespresents tripping and falling hazards to persons who work around the collar,and falling material hazards to those who work at the bottom of the drawhole.The final rule clarifies that the standard does not apply when muck ormaterial is being transferred through the drawhole. <T3>Section 57.9362 Protection of signalmen. </T3>This standard revisesexisting andSection;57.9102 which provides that signalmen used during slushingoperations must be positioned in a safe place. The proposal clarified thatsignalmen must be located away from possible contact with cables, sheaves,or slusher buckets during slushing operations in underground mines becausebroken cables can cause serious injuries. No comments were received onthis standard. The final rule clarifies the proposed language, consistentwith the intent of the standard to protect signalmen from contact withslushing hazards. H. Section-by-Section Discussion of Subpart M <ITAG tagnum="81">Safety Devices and Maintenance Requirements </ITAG><T3>Section 56/57.14100 Safety defects; examination, correction and records.</T3>This final standard is derived from existing and proposed standardswhich appeared in Subparts H and M. It consolidates the equipment examination,defect correction and recording requirements of existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9001,56/57.9002, 56/57.9073, and 56/57.14026. The rule addresses machinery andpowered haulage accidents by establishing procedures for detection andcorrection of defects. Powered haulage accidents and machinery and equipment accidents in metaland nonmetal mines are among the leading causes of fatalities and seriousinjuries. These accidents are often attributable to defects in the machineryand equipment which can develop at any time. During a five year periodending in December 1987, 104 fatalities occurred on equipment which isrequired to be examined for defects by this section. An additional 60 fatalitieswere recorded during this same period on machinery and equipment addressedby the defect correction requirements of this section. Self-propelled mobile equipment is specifically required to be examinedprior to use on each shift where it is to be placed in operation. Thisspecific requirement is included in the standard in view of the fact thatdefects affecting safety become more critical when they occur on a pieceof equipment which is mobile throughout the mine. If safety defects are detected on any equipment, machinery or tools, therequired compliance measures vary with the degree of the hazard. The finalrule requires that all safety defects be corrected in a timely manner andthat, in instances where continued use would pose a risk of injury, thecorrection must be made immediately unless the defective equipment is removedfrom service and identified as defective. The defective condition mustbe corrected before the equipment is returned to service. The time allowed to correct a safety defect will vary, depending upon thespecific circumstances involved. For example, broken windshield wiperswould constitute a defect affecting safety which would require timely repair.However, if this defect existed at a time when the wipers were needed becauseof rain, snow, or other conditions which affected visibility, then theremoval from service or repair would have to be immediate. The primaryreason for this differentiation among safety defects is to ensure thatsafety defects that impose an immediate hazard to persons are correctedbefore the equipment is used. It also provides that other safety defectswill be corrected before they present a hazard to persons. It is expectedthat defects not creating an immediate hazard will be attended to withoutdelay, normally at the end of the shift in which the defect is discovered.When safety defects on self-propelled mobile equipment are not correctedimmediately, the defect must be reported to the mine operator. Reportsof these defects must be recorded by the mine operator and retained untilthe defect has been corrected. If no defects affecting safety are found,no documentation is required. This reporting and recording procedure whichwas contained in the proposed rule for Subpart H, will ensure that personsin authority are made aware of defects and can arrange for appropriatecorrection while also keeping the recordkeeping burden to a minimum. Some commenters believed that there should be no recordkeeping requirementwhen corrective action is taken immediately upon detection of the defect.Others believed that, as in the existing standard, there should be a recordmade in each instance and that these records should be retained for someperiod of time in order to build accountability for repairs. MSHA notesthat it is a common practice to make on the spot repairs on equipment inthe field. In these circumstances the Agency believes that it would beunnecessary to require a record to be made of the defect. From a safetystandpoint, the critical consideration is the correction of the defect.Therefore, the final rule provides that no record need be made where thecorrective action is immediate. Some commenters suggested that the recordkeeping requirements of this sectionbe expanded to cover all mobile equipment, regardless of whether it isself-propelled. Others believed that the scope of the standard should continueto apply only to self-propelled mobile equipment. In MSHA's view, the inclusionof all mobile equipment within the scope of this standard would unnecessarilyincrease recordkeeping requirements; therefore, the final rule continuesto limit this requirement to self-propelled mobile equipment. Commenters also focused on the requirement to tag or otherwise effectivelymark equipment that is taken out of service. Some commenters believed thattagging was a minimal burden that should be required in all instances.Others took the position that, in addition to tagging or marking defectiveequipment, the standard should also permit an alternative of allowing equipmentto be placed in a designated repair area. These commenters stated thatsuch placement was a common practice and that persons do not mistakenlyuse defective equipment under this arrangement. Under the final rule this alternative is permitted as long as the equipmentis placed in a designated area that is posted for defective equipment.Equipment located within a repair shop or repair yard would be consideredin compliance with this requirement. Tagging or some other effective methodof marking must be used whenever the equipment is not immediately removedto a designated repair area. <T3>Section 56/57.14101 Brakes. </T3>This final standard sets forth minimumperformance requirements for braking systems on self-propelled mobile equipmentand requires that all braking systems be maintained in functional condition.It replaces existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9003 which required that theequipment be provided with adequate brakes. The rule provides for servicebrake tests on surface-operated equipment to determine the capability ofa vehicle's braking system, clarifies the existing standard regarding adequatebrakes, and also prevents the hazard by setting out specific braking requirements.In addition, it provides the mine operator with a specific means of testinghis vehicles' brakes prior to inspection by MSHA. Rail equipment is excludedfrom this standard and is addressed by andSection;andSection;56/57.14103. In the past three years, there were 88 accidents related to brake failureinvolving loading, hauling, and dumping equipment, of which 3 resultedin fatal injuries. During FY 86, under existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9002,680 violations were cited for faulty braking systems and during FY 87,763 violations were issued. Nearly all types of self-propelled mobile equipment found at mining propertiesare equipped with one or more braking systems. The service braking systemis the primary system for stopping and holding equipment during normaluse. Some large equipment also utilizes retarding mechanisms to supplementservice braking systems. Most equipment also is provided with a parking(secondary) brake system. Service braking systems must be capable of stoppingand holding the equipment, with its typical load, on the maximum gradeit travels. Some commenters pointed out that several types of equipment, such as someself-propelled lawn mowers, are not manufactured with brakes. The finalrule takes this into consideration by providing that the standard doesnot apply to equipment which is not originally manufactured with brakesunless the equipment is used in a manner which requires the use of brakesfor safe operation. Some commenters suggested that battery and air-poweredequipment be exempted from the rule. However, this equipment is often usedin a manner which necessitates the use of brakes. The rule also requires that self-propelled mobile equipment equipped withparking brakes shall be capable of holding the equipment with its typicalload on the maximum grade it travels. Several commenters to this provisionurged MSHA to limit this performance requirement to a maximum grade of15 percent. They noted that the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) documentJ 1152 has this performance limitation. The final rule retains the performance requirement that the parking brakebe capable of holding the equipment on the maximum grade traveled. MSHAnotes that the SAE document establishes only the minimum acceptable performance.Although grades in excess of 15 percent are not common at mining operations,equipment must be able to perform safely under the conditions to whichit is subjected. The steeper the grade, the more demand is placed on thebrakes. If the brake does not perform, the vehicle will roll. Of the fewoperations having grades that are greater than 15 percent, MSHA estimatesthat most if not all mine operators would choose to regrade rather thanincur costs to retrofit existing braking systems. These increased regradingcosts would be offset by reduced equipment operating costs. MSHA expectsthat the cost savings will offset the cost of regrading. The second part of this rule addresses service brake system testing. Itprovides for tests on surface-operated self-propelled mobile equipmentwhich is capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour when there isreason to believe that the service brake system does not function as required.MSHA will not be conducting routine or random testing of equipment. Thepurpose of the test is to determine the performance of the service brakesystem. To pass the service brake test, equipment must not exceed the maximumstopping distance for its weight class at the speed tested. The maximumstopping distances are listed in Table M-1 of the standard. The brake test is based on recommended minimum performance standards forservice brakes which are set forth in the SAE document J 1152. MSHA's testcombines different machine categories and weights from the SAE document,extracts the appropriate stopping distances from each group, and adds aone second response time. MSHA brake testing requirements, while differingsomewhat from those in SAE J 1152 because of conditions likely to be encounteredin the mining environment, are nevertheless based on widely accepted criteria.The requirements of this standard will provide the necessary measure ofsafety at the mine site.Field testing of equipment is not expected to be frequent, and would notimpose a significant burden on the mining operation. In its field tests,MSHA found that four brake test runs were typically completed in less thanten minutes. Under the final rule, equipment which passes the first testwill not be tested further.Some commenters favored the deletion of the testing provision. These commenterswere concerned that testing could be dangerous since it would involve equipmentwith brakes which are already suspect. The final rule contains severalprovisions to ensure that brake testing will be performed safely. Testingwill not occur when the mine operator agrees that the equipment's servicebrakes do not function as required and orders that the equipment be removedfrom service for repair. Although some commenters wanted mine operatorsto have the option of removing equipment for inspection instead of repair,others agreed that if the mine operator chooses to test, repair actionshould be initiated. The operator has the option to conduct testing andrepair prior to inspection by MSHA. Testing would only be utilized in thoseinstances when there is disagreement about the performance capabilitiesof the service brakes. To further ensure safety, an MSHA inspector mayindependently determine that the equipment would be too hazardous to testin the field. For example, the inspector would not permit testing in anyinstance where a brakeline was plugged. The inspector will also inquireas to whether the equipment operator or mine operator is aware of any defecton the equipment about to be tested.Testing is not to occur unless there is an appropriate test site at themining operation. Working with the mine operator to ensure that no hazardwill be presented by testing, the MSHA inspector will instruct the equipmentoperator before any testing to activate the equipment's emergency brakesshould the service brakes fail completely. The mine operator can designatethe person who will operate the equipment during the test. Most testingsites will also provide a course of sufficient length to allow the equipmentto come to a rolling stop in the event of complete failure of all brakingsystems.MSHA inspectors will also be trained to safely conduct these tests. Personsand equipment will be clear of the approach and measured course duringtesting. While testing places demands upon the equipment's service brakes,these demands are comparable to those that would be encountered in thecontinued performance of the equipment's routine functions at the minesite.Several commenters who favored the deletion of the proposed rule's braketesting provision urged MSHA to substitute the ``stall test'' in its place.This test measures, under certain conditions, the equipment's mechanicalbraking capability against engine power.MSHA did not adopt the stall test in the final rule for several reasons.The stall test only measures the static holding capability of the equipment'sservice brakes. As noted by commenters, for larger equipment it is thedynamic braking which does most of the work in slowing equipment for astop.For large equipment which utilizes some form of dynamic braking, mechanicalbraking becomes important at speeds below 10 mph. Unlike the stall test,the final rule's brake testing procedure does evaluate dynamic braking.The stall test cannot generally be applied to all equipment. The limitedinformation provided by a stall test is only valid when the manufacturerhas specifically designed the test for the exact equipment in question.Several comments were directed toward the issue of which brakes may beapplied in a service brake test. Some commenters were concerned that theuse of the term ``service brakes'' in the proposed rule would prohibitthe use of dynamic brakes during tests. The final rule allows the use of``auxiliary retarders'' when they are simultaneously activated by the applicationof the service brake control. The term ``dynamic brakes'' and ``auxiliaryretarders'' are often used interchangably. The final rule clarifies MSHA'sintent that all braking systems which are designed to bring the equipmentto a stop under normal operating circumstances may be used during the test.Parking and emergency brakes or, as they are sometimes described, secondarybrakes, are not to be used during a test since they are not designed orintended to stop equipment under normal braking circumstances.Another aspect of testing involves the load carried by the vehicle beingtested. In the proposed rule, MSHA provided that service brakes were tobe tested with the equipment ``fully loaded.'' Several commenters objectedto this provision. They favored testing vehicles which were loaded to theirgross vehicle weight, while others took the position that either of thosemeasures would be inappropriate where a mining operation routinely fillsits haul trucks below their capacity.The final rule responds to these concerns by providing that equipment isto be tested with a load which is typical for the particular model of equipmentat the mining operations. Gross vehicle weight was not utilized as themeasure for loading because it would be necessary to weigh equipment beforea test. Scales are not always present at operations and even where present,the load for some equipment may exceed the scale's measuring capacity.MSHA notes that the testing provisions of the brake standard is not limitedto haulage trucks. It applies to all types of self-propelled mobile equipmentwhich is capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour. For non-haulagevehicles, the typical load consists of the load, if any, that is normallycarried by the equipment to be tested.Several commenters were concerned that front-end loaders with full bucketsmight have less stability during testing and could spill some of theirload. To ensure safety, the final rule provides that front-end loadersare to be tested with the loader bucket empty. For safety reasons the finalrule also provides that equipment carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives,may not be tested with those loads. In such instances, the hazardous loadmust be removed and an equivalent substitute weight placed on the equipmentbefore testing.Some commenters also believed that the table which sets forth the maximumallowable distances should have a separate weight category and longer stoppingdistances added for equipment weighing over 600,000 pounds. The final ruledoes not provide an additional category because the heaviest weight classalready specifically includes all equipment which exceeds 400,000 pounds.The major reason for allowing greater stopping distances for heavier equipmentis to take into account the increased time it takes for the service brakesystem to respond to the application of the brake. This ``system responsetime'' does not significantly increase for equipment which exceeds 400,000pounds.Commenters also questioned whether the standard should include testingof equipment underground. The proposed rule provided that testing wouldapply to all equipment capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour.Many commenters objected to testing of equipment underground due to restrictedroadway widths, the presence of drift walls, and limited lighting. Othercommenters believed that while some underground roadways would be inappropriate,each situation should be independently assessed. MSHA has considered bothof these viewpoints but, in recognition of the limitations for brake testingunderground, the final rule limits testing to equipment which is used atsurface locations. Therefore, testing applies to surface locations at undergroundmines and all surface mines.Several comments were directed toward the details of testing. As pointedout by commenters, some equipment with defective brakes could, technically,pass a brake test by sliding sideways as long as the maximum distance wasnot exceeded.In such a situation, more than the braking system in at work in stoppingthe equipment since lateral motion is involved. Equipment is not designedor intended to stop in this manner. For this reason, the final rule providesthat a valid test requires that the equipment not slide sideways or exhibitother lateral motion while braking.The proposed rule also provided that the roadway approach have sufficientlength and uniformity of grade to enable the equipment to maintain a stablerate of speed. The proposal stated that the braking portion of the testcourse was to be generally level, dry, and packed. Some commenters believedthese ground conditions would be difficult to find and could be a sourceof controversy. MSHA's field testing disclosed that appropriate test siteswill exist at most mines. As mentioned in the proposed rule, a distanceof less than one-sixth of a mile is needed. However, where no appropriatesite is present, no tests would be required. Test sites are not requiredto be constructed under this standard, although some mining operationsmay decide to designate their own test sites as a useful method of fieldtesting their own equipment after repairs.The final rule clarifies that the approach is to be of sufficient lengthto allow the equipment operator to reach and maintain a constant speedbetween 10 and 20 miles per hour prior to entering the 100 foot measuredarea. In response to comments, the final rule states that the roadway isto be wide enough to adequately accommodate the size of the equipment beingtested. It also explains that ground moisture may be present to the extentthat it does not adversely affect the braking surface. Some degree of groundmoisture has the effect of improving stopping performance. Although somecommenters expressed concern that spillage during testing could affectwhether the ground remains generally level, MSHA has determined that thiswill be unlikely since testing will typically involve a single piece ofequipment. The testing of front-end loaders with their buckets empty shouldalso diminish this likelihood. Should this problem arise, the course couldalso be regraded, but MSHA's field testing revealed that limited amountsof spillage did not affect the outcome or safety of the tests.Although some commenters suggested that the equipment's power train bepermitted to be disengaged during braking, the final rule does not allowthis action unless the equipment is designed to function that way. Disengagingthe power train may improve braking performance, since it disengages therotational inertia of the electric motors on some equipment. However, exceptwhere so designed as part of the service brake system for stopping, thisprocedure would be inconsistent with the equipment's normal method of stopping.MSHA's field testing revealed that all well-maintained properly functioningequipment, regardless of its age, was able to readily pass the brake testswithout this assistance.As confirmed by MSHA's field studies, the brake testing provision providesan objective, safe and reliable means for mine management and MSHA to resolvequestions about the performance of service brake systems on surface equipment.It provides means to quantitatively measure the performance of the brakesystems in question.Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mining operation orthe equipment is not capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour, servicebrake tests will not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will relyupon other available evidence to determine whether the service brake systemmeets the performance requirement of this standard.<T3>Section 56/57.14102 Brakes for rail equipment. </T3>This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9048 by clarifying that brakingsystems on railroad cars and locomotives are required to be maintainedin functional condition.Several commenters wanted this section to apply only in those instanceswhen rail equipment is under the control of the mine operator. These commentersnoted that there is great diversity in the business relationships betweenmine operators and railroads as to ownership, maintenance, and controlover rail equipment. MSHA's objective is to provide for safe rail equipmenton mine property, regardless of who owns or controls the equipment. However,when a violation of a standard pertaining to rail equipment is involved,MSHA will examine the circumstances to determine who is responsible forcorrection of the violation.Some commenters considered it unnecessary for all railroad car brakingsystems to be functioning if there were a sufficient number of cars withfunctioning systems to be able to stop the train. MSHA has considered thisapproach but the final rule requires each railroad car equipped with abraking system to be functional. That system must be maintained in functionalcondition for several reasons. First, cars are often handled individuallyand their braking systems must function individually. Second, if the brakingsystems on all cars were not maintained, numerous cars could be linkedtogether with no functional brakes.The final rule does not require the installation of braking systems, butrather requires that provided systems be maintained in functional condition.<T3>Section 56/57.14103 Operators' stations. </T3>This final standard setsforth several safety requirements relating to the operator's station onself-propelled mobile equipment. It consolidates existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9010, 56/57.9011, and 56/57.9012.Paragraph (a) requires that when windows are provided on equipment theyare to be of safety glass or a material with an equivalent safety characteristicmaintained to provide safe operating visibility. Commenters asked MSHAto explain what would be equivalent to safety glass. Safety glass is ageneral term which refers to a type of glass which breaks into relativelyharmless granules upon impact, instead of sharp pieces. Therefore, anyglass or plastic product with equivalent performance qualities meets therequirements of this paragraph.Some commenters also suggested that this paragraph retain the existingrequirement that windows be kept ``clean'', instead of the proposed rule'swording that windows be maintained to provide safe operating visibility.MSHA retained the wording of the proposed rule because it more accuratelydescribes the desired performance objective of the standard.Paragraph (b) addresses damaged windows. It requires the removal and insome instances, replacement of windows when they have been damaged in amanner which either obscures operating visibility or poses a risk of injuryto the equipment operator. Replacement is required where the absence ofa window would leave the equipment operator exposed to hazardous environmentalconditions which would affect the ability to safely operate the equipment.While some commenters believed that the rule should specifically name thehazardous environmental conditions which would require replacement of windows,others stated that the performance language of the proposed rule permittedflexibility to address each circumstance. The final rule requires windowreplacement only when hazardous environmental conditions such as extremecold weather, rain, snow, or dust affect the ability of the equipment operatorto safely operate the equipment.Paragraph (c) requires that operators' stations be free of materials whichcould impair safe operation of the equipment and prohibits modificationof the station in a manner which would impair visibility. Commenters wereconcerned that the standard, as proposed, could be interpreted as prohibitingsome factory installed equipment options. The standard would only prohibitoptions that obscure visibility or otherwise affect safety. It is unlikelythat factory installed equipment would hinder safe operation or impairvisibility since manufacturers take these concerns into account in designingequipment.<T3>Section 56/57.14104 Tire repairs. </T3>This final standard appearedin the proposed rule for loading, hauling, and dumping and replaces existingandSection;andSection; 56/57.9069. It addresses the safety procedures and devicesto be employed when tires are being repaired. Serious injuries and fatalitieshave occurred to miners who have been engaged in tire repair. In severalinstances, multi-piece rims have separated during repair. Tremendous forcecan accompany such a separation. For example, a size ten hundred twentytire inflated to 100 psi, creates a pressure of 41,600 pounds against therim flange. In the proposed rule, these hazards were addressed by requiringtire deflation before repairs were started and by using devices duringtire inflation to constrain wheel components in the event of an explosiveseparation. As an alternative, the proposal would have permitted devicesthat allow persons to stand clear of the trajectory of such a separation.In response to commenters, the final rule clarifies several aspects ofthese requirements.The proposed rule required that tires be deflated before repairs are started.The final rule retains this requirement and specifies that before repairinga tire, the valve core must be partially removed to allow for gradual deflation.The proposed rule also provided that when repair was necessary on eithertire of a dual wheel, both tires were to be deflated before either wasremoved from the equipment. Many commenters objected to this provision.They believed that this requirement could increase the probability of ahazard since two tires would need to be reinflated after repair of thedefective tire had been completed. The commenters believed that the hazardsassociated with tire repairs were greatest during re-inflation of the tire.MSHA had proposed that both tires be deflated where dual wheels were involvedbecause in some repair instances the inner wheel rim has separated violently,forcing the outer tire and rim to fly off. However, this hazard must beweighed against the hazards associated with tire inflation. MSHA agreesthat requiring both tires to be deflated would increase the probabilityof an injury since wheel rim separation is always a risk during tire inflation.For this reason, the final rule does not contain the requirement to deflateboth tires. MSHA notes that the final rule's provision for the use of devicesthat allow persons to stand outside of the potential trajectory of thelock ring should diminish the potential for injury in the event of separationof the inner wheel's rim.Several comments were directed to the scope of the standard. One commenterasked whether the standard would apply where brake or axle repair was involved.Another questioned whether re-inflation of a tire, apart from any repair,is covered by the standard. The standard is intended to address hazardsto persons which are associated with the performance of repair work ontires. Since brake and axle repair do not directly involve tire work thestandard does not apply to those situations. However, tire re-inflation,even apart from any repair, involves direct work on tires and can posethe same hazard of sudden wheel rim failure. Therefore, the provisionsof paragraph (b), involving the use of a restraining device or a stand-offinflation device, apply to tire inflation in all situations. Should a malfunctionoccur while using a stand-off inflation device which requires the needto approach the tire, the following precautions should be taken: The tireshould either be deflated, or a safety cage, chain or restraint shouldbe used, and the tire should be approached from the side.Commenters also stated that the standard should apply to single as wellas multi-piece wheel rims. Other commenters believed that the standardshould adopt the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA)provisions for the servicing of wheels (29 CFR 1910.177) which appliesto single and multi-piece wheels. MSHA agrees that both wheel types canpresent hazards during deflation and inflation, and the requirements ofthe rule apply to both. Similarly, in answer to one commenter's requestfor clarification, this standard applies to all wheeled vehicles, bothon and off road types. A review of mining accidents from 1978 to 1980 associatedwith tire repairs, indicates that 54 injuries occurred which included 6fatalities from tire explosions. After reviewing these accidents and theOSHA provisions, MSHA believes that the final rule will provide the appropriatelevel of protection against the hazards associated with tire repairs.Commenters stated that the standard did not specify the strength requiredfor tire cages or other restraining devices. The final rule includes performancelanguage which requires that the device must be capable of constrainingall wheel rim components during an explosive separation. Although somecommenters did not believe that a stand-off inflation device should bepermitted as an alternative to a restraining device, MSHA has allowed thisalternative since both devices furnish protection from explosive separation.One commenter noted that the standard did not clarify whether tire repairscould be performed on loaded, or unloaded, jacked-equipment. These relatedrepair aspects are addressed by andSection;andSection; 56/57.14105. Editorially,the standard uses the more commonly recognized ``multi-piece rim'' in placeof the proposed rule's reference to ``wheel locking rims''.<T3>Section 56/57.14105 Procedures during repairs or maintenance. </T3>Thisfinal standard clarifies the requirements of existing andSection;andSection;56/57.14029. Prior to the performance of repairs or maintenance on machineryor equipment, the power must be off and the machinery or equipment blockedagainst hazardous motion. The final rule allows an exception to this requirementwhich permits machinery and equipment motion or activation to the extentnecessary for adjustment or testing, as long as persons are not exposedto hazardous motion. The existing standard had permitted this exceptiononly when it was necessary for making adjustments.  The proposed rule included a requirement that the power also be ``locked-out''.Commenters pointed out that for some types of mechanical equipment thisrequirement was not practical. For example, some types of self-propelledmobile equipment start without an ignition key system. These commentersalso noted that where electrically powered equipment is involved, andSection;andSection;56/57.12016 and 56/57.12017 require that power switches be locked-out.MSHA agrees that many types of mechanically-powered equipment cannot belocked-out practically and that other standards address lock-out requirementsfor electrically powered equipment. The final rule, therefore, does notcontain the proposed ``lock-out'' requirement.  <T3>56/57.14106 Falling object protection.</T3> This final standard revisesand clarifies existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14013 and was proposedin Subpart H. It addresses the injuries and fatalities which have occurredto operators of certain types of mining equipment as a result of fallingobjects. The rule requires that protective structures be provided on fork-lifttrucks, front-end loaders, and bulldozers if the equipment is used in anarea where falling objects could present a hazard to the equipment operator. The existing standard required that this equipment be provided with ``substantialcanopies when necessary to protect the operator.'' The final rule retainsthe performance-oriented language while requiring that the strength ofthe structure be consistent with the anticipated loads. It further clarifiesthat the protection is required when the equipment is used in an environmentwhich could create a hazard of falling objects. If hazards such as fallingground near a bank, highwall or face, or toppling materials at a storagefacility or materials handling site could be anticipated, a structure mustbe provided. An evaluation would be necessary to determine the anticipatedweights and forces of the falling object so that sufficient strength canbe built into the structure.  In many instances, fork-lift trucks, front-end loaders, and bulldozersare equipped at time of manufacture with structures which meet the applicablefalling object protective structures (FOPS) specifications of SAE or theAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI). These specifications arebased on extensive engineering studies which have taken into account anticipatedweights and forces of falling objects. Structures meeting these specifications,therefore, would comply with this standard.  The standard also allows for on-site fabrication and installation of structuresother than those which meet the specifications of SAE and ANSI standardsprovided that the necessary strength requirements are considered.  The proposed rule provided for compliance through incorporation by referenceof the SAE and ANSI standards. Some commenters preferred the approach ofthe existing standard's requirement to provide ``substantial'' canopieson the listed equipment. They considered the incorporation by referencein the proposal to be an ``unnecessary complexity''. In contrast, othercommenters preferred the incorporation by reference approach because itrequired a measured degree of safety. A third group of commenters requestedthat the standard permit both approaches. Agency experience has indicatedthat the necessary degree of safety can be achieved through either alternativeand the final rule, therefore, recognizes structures which meet the SAEor ANSI standards as well as those which meet the standards' performancerequirements as acceptable for compliance with the rule.  Commenters also contended that the incorporated documents contained inthe proposed rule may not address all types and sizes of the listed equipmentwhich is found at metal and nonmetal mines and may not be appropriate inall situations. In view of these comments and the Agency's desire to replace incorporationsby reference with specific performance-oriented requirements where possible,this standard contains no incorporation by reference. To assist mine operatorsin meeting the performance criteria for falling object protective structures,an appendix of applicable national consensus standards is included as aninformational aid.<T3>Section 56/57.14107 Moving machine parts.</T3> This final standardrevises and consolidates existing andSection;andSection;56/57.14001 and 56/57.14003.As with the existing standard, the final standard requires the installationof guards to protect persons from coming into contact with hazardous movingmachine parts. The standard clarifies that the objective is to preventcontact with these machine parts. The guard must enclose the moving partsto the extent necessary to achieve this objective. It also provides thatguarding by location is recognized as an alternative to a physical guardin instances where the exposed moving parts are elevated at least sevenfeet above walking or working surfaces.The proposed rule would not have permitted guarding by location for fanblades. This was based upon a concern that the blades could become projectilesupon disengagement from the fan shaft. Commenters questioned whether aguard would be able to contain a fan projectile and whether guarding wasneeded at all for elevated ventilation fans which operate at low speeds.MSHA agrees that in several situations a guard would not be able to provideeffective containment, and in other situations would not be practical ornecessary. For these reasons, the final standard permits guarding by elevatedlocation for fan blades, as well as for the other classes of moving machineparts. This change is consistent with the standard's intent to protectpersons from contacting moving machine parts, as opposed to protectingpersons from machine parts which have become projectiles after becomingdisengaged from a machine.Some commenters suggested that the standard also permit an exception forsituations where the exposed moving parts are ``located out of reach.''However, this phrase would create uncertainty as to the standard's application.Under the final rule, the standard applies where the moving machine partscan be contacted and cause injury. Some commenters believed that guardsshould provide protection against inadvertent, careless, or accidentalcontact but not against deliberate or purposeful actions. They consideredguards which totally enclose moving parts as counter-productive to othersafety considerations such as proper work procedures, training, and generalattention to hazardous conditions.In reviewing the statistics in which persons working in mines have losthands, arms, legs, and their lives to moving machine parts, MSHA notesthat in most of those instances the persons were performing deliberateor purposeful work-related actions with the machinery. The installationof a guard to enclose the moving machine parts would have prevented mostof those injuries. Guards provide a physical barrier, which offers themost effective protection from hazards associated with moving machine parts.MSHA recognizes that guards provide only one of several safety measuresfor preventing injuries which can result from contact with moving machineparts. Proper work procedures, safety training, and attentiveness to hazardsall play a role in reducing those injuries.Some commenters questioned whether the standard would require guardingbeyond that provided by the manufacturer for the engine cooling fan onsmall vehicles such as vans or pickup trucks. In those situations the vehiclesize and the engine hood would act to prevent access and contact with theexposed moving parts, and no additional guard would be required. However,larger, off-road vehicles present special hazards because of the greateraccessibility to their moving machine parts. In some instances personscan walk directly under the vehicle to inspect the engine and be exposedto its moving parts. In most instances, these parts are already guardedby the manufacturer but guards are sometimes removed during repair workand not replaced. MSHA's objective is to ensure that these guards remainin place.Commenters also questioned whether the guarding requirement would reduceequipment inspection and maintenance capability by obscuring the abilityto make observations of belt slippage or breakage. The commenters alsobelieved that guards which met the performance objective of the proposedstandard would be heavy and, therefore, pose risks of strained backs, hernias,and injured hands during installation or removal for maintenance.The final rule does not require guards which are different from those currentlyrequired. Instead, the standard is intended to clarify the performanceobjective of guards. The standard does not specify the type of materialto be used for guarding, but expanded metal or transparent safety plasticsare examples of alternatives which provide lightweight means to enclosethe moving parts so that they cannot be contacted while also allowing observationduring machinery operation.<T3>Section 56/57.14108 Overhead drive belts. </T3>This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14002. It requires guarding ofoverhead drive belts in instances where the whipping action of a brokenbelt could be hazardous to persons. The existing standard applied onlywhere the whipping action could affect persons beneath the overhead belt.The final rule clarifies that the standard applies to drive belts and thatcontainment of the hazardous whipping action is required for all directionswhere the danger exists.<T3>Section 56/57.14109 Unguarded conveyors with adjacent travelways. </T3>Thisfinal standard revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9007. It requiresthat unguarded conveyors next to travelways be equipped with emergencystop devices or protective railings. Emergency stop devices must be locatedso that a person falling on or against the conveyor can readily de-activatethe conveyor. If railings are used as an alternative to stop devices, therailings must be placed in a position which will provide protection forthe person and must be capable of preventing persons from falling on oragainst the conveyor. Under the existing standard, railings have been permittedby MSHA policy.Commenters questioned whether the emergency stop devices must run the lengthof the conveyor or the length of the travelway. The standard has been revisedto clarify that it applies only to the extent that the travelway is alongan adjacent and unguarded conveyor. Where portions of the travelway andconveyor are not adjacent, emergency stop devices are not required.Some commenters were concerned that the alternative permitting railingsas a means of compliance would limit the standard to pipe railings andprohibit the use of other materials. The standard does not restrict thetype of material used. The important consideration is that the railingmeet the standard's performance requirements by being positioned properlyand structurally capable of preventing persons from falling on or againstthe conveyor.The railings must be able to withstand the anticipated forces such as vibration,shock and wear, to which they would be subjected during normal operations.Consideration must also be given to construction material and maintenanceso that the railing does not pose a hazard. For example, if wire ropesor wood are used, they must not be frayed or have jagged ends which couldcreate a puncture or laceration hazard to a person traveling in the area.<T3>Section 56/57.14110 Flying or falling materials. </T3>This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14011 and addresses those instanceswhere a hazard is created by flying or falling materials generated fromthe operation of screens, crushers, or conveyors. The existing standarddid not specify the sources of the flying or falling material. The finalstandard requires guards, shields, or equivalent protection to be providedin areas where persons are exposed to hazards from those sources. Somecommenters believed the standard should address all instances where a hazardis created by flying or falling materials. MSHA has limited the scope ofthe standard in the final rule to those hazards associated with the operationof screens, crushers, or conveyors because several other safety standardsalready provide protection from other specific sources of flying or fallingmaterials.<T3>Section 56/57.14111 Slusher, backlash guards and securing. </T3>Thisfinal standard revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9015. It requiresthat safety devices be provided when slushers are used. A slusher is aversatile piece of machinery which is used to move material or other machineryby means of a hoisting engine, cables, and two drums on which the cableis wound. It is distinguished from a similar machine known as an ``airtugger'' which has a single drum and cable.Commenters suggested that the proposed rule's requirement to securely anchorslushers and equip them with rollers and drum covers be limited to situationswhere persons are exposed to slushing operations. MSHA agrees and the finalrule adds this qualification to address situations where slushing operationsare performed by remote control or from protective enclosures. Commentersalso suggested that cable guides be permitted in place of rollers. MSHAdid not adopt this suggestion because guides can cause burrs to developon the cable and increase the chance of a hangup or break in the cable.In response to commenters, the final rule expressly states that the standarddoes not apply to air tuggers of 10 horsepower or less that have only onecable and one drum. As noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, thisstandard is not intended to apply to such devices since their low horsepowerminimizes the hazards associated with slushers.<T3>Section 56/57.14112 Construction and maintenance of guards. </T3>Thisfinal standard replaces and consolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14006and 56/57.14007. As with the existing standards, it addresses constructioncharacteristics, maintenance, and safe practice requirements for guards.To be useful and effective, guards must not themselves create a hazardand must be able to withstand the vibration, shock, and wear to which theywould be subjected during normal operations. In response to commenters,the rule does not include the proposed rule's reference to ``all reasonable''vibration, shock, and wear and clarifies that guards must be able to standup to the stresses they will be subjected to during normal operation. Boththe existing standard, and the new standard require that guards remainsecurely in place while machinery is being operated. However, the finalstandard permits removal of the guard when the testing or adjustment ofthe machinery could not otherwise be performed. The existing standard hadpermitted guard removal only for testing.<T3>Section 56/57.14113 Inclined conveyors: backstop or brakes. </T3>Thisfinal standard clarifies existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9013. It requiresthe installation of backstops or brakes on drive units of inclined conveyorsto prevent the conveyors from running in reverse and exposing persons tothe risk of material rushing downward which can occur when the inclinecauses the conveyor and the material being conveyed to reverse direction.The final standard clarifies that these devices are installed on the driveunits of inclined conveyors.Commenters were concerned that the standard's requirement for devices which``prevent'' conveyors from running in reverse might prohibit the slightbackward motion which occurs when the brake is setting up. Because thestandards performance objective is to prevent conveyors from ``running''in reverse, the momentary backward motion as the brake engages would notconstitute a violation.<T3>Section 56/57.14114 Air valves for pneumatic equipment. </T3>This finalstandard clarifies the requirements of existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9026.It requires a manual master quick-close type air valve on all pneumatic-poweredequipment if there is risk of uncontrolled movement of the equipment whenthe air supply is activated. The valve is required to be closed unlessthe equipment is being operated.Some commenters wanted the standard to be revised to apply only to operatorcontrolled self-propelled pneumatic powered equipment which is used forloading, hauling, and dumping. In MSHA's view, all types of pneumatic poweredequipment which present a potential for uncontrolled movement upon activationof the air supply, need to be equipped with this safety valve. MSHA notesthat these valves are a standard feature on most types of pneumatic equipmentwhich have this hazard potential. MSHA is aware that some equipment isprovided with a control trigger switch and cannot be activated unless thetrigger is depressed. Pneumatic powered equipment provided with a triggerswitch control is not required to have a master valve since no uncontrolledmotion could occur until the trigger is depressed.Some commenters opposed the proposed rule's requirement that the valvebe closed unless the equipment is being operated. They believed it wasunnecessary to have the valve closed when the equipment was not connectedto the air supply. Other commenters favored having the valve remain closedexcept during operation of the equipment. MSHA retained this requirementin the final rule to avoid the potential for injury which may occur whenequipment with an open valve is inadvertently connected to an open airsupply, thereby creating sudden movement of the pneumatic equipment.<T3>Section 56/57.14115 Stationary grinding machines.</T3> This final standardrevises and clarifies existing andSection;andSection;56/57.14008. As with theexisting standard, the final standard requires peripheral hoods, safetywashers, and adjustable tool rests as safety devices for stationary grindingmachines. It specifies the maximum allowable opening between adjustabletool rests and grinding wheels. The tool rest opening is an important safetyconsideration because a gap which is larger than the width of the materialbeing ground can allow the material to be drawn into the grinding wheeland cause serious injury. To eliminate this hazard, the standard requiresthat the opening be set so that all points between the grinding surfaceof the wheel and the tool rest are not greater than \1/8\ inch.The existing standard required the tool rest opening to be set as closeas practical to the wheel. In the preproposal draft, the agency includeda performance oriented requirement that would have permitted a variabletool rest opening, as long as the opening was smaller than the materialbeing worked. The proposed rule provided that the opening not exceed \1/8\inch. Although some commenters preferred the variable opening requirement,other commenters supported the \1/8\ inch requirement.The \1/8\ inch opening has been recognized as a setting which providesreliable protection from the serious hazard of material being drawn intothe grinding wheel. The opening is also identical to the ANSI recommendedpractice for grinding wheel tool rest settings which that organizationhas advocated for four decades.A risk associated with the variable setting approach is that each individualmay have to adjust the tool rest opening prior to using the grinding machine.Failure to make the adjustment or misjudgment as to the maximum safe opening,could cause a serious injury if the material gets drawn into the grinder.Maintaining a maximum \1/8\ inch opening provides protection regardlessof the size of the material being worked or whether the opening is checkedprior to use. For these reasons, MSHA believes that a fixed \1/8\ inchmaximum opening more effectively addresses the hazard than would a requirementpermitting variable openings.Commenters also suggested that the standard include two additional safetypractices for stationary grinding machines. One suggestion was the inclusionof the ``ring test'' to verify that new grinding wheels are nondefectiveprior to their installation on a grinding machine. Another commenter suggestedthat the standard prohibit the practice of grinding items on the side ofthe wheel, instead of the surface edge. These situations are addressedby andSection;andSection;56/57.14205, which require that tools and equipmentbe used according to the manufacturer's specification and instructions.<T3>Section 56/57.14116 Hand-held power tools.</T3> This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection;56/57.14010. It addresses operatingcontrols for certain classes of hand-held power tools. The existing standardrequired constant pressure operating switches, or their equivalent, forthese tools. The final standard clarifies these requirements and liststhe tools to which it applies. It requires power drills, disc sanders,grinders, circular saws, and chain saws to be equipped with operating controlsrequiring constant hand or finger pressure. Many power drills, disc sanders,and grinders are also equipped with devices which can lock-on the operatingcontrols. Under the final rule, these tools are to be operated only byusing the constant pressure switch when they are being operated by hand.Circular saws and chain saws are prohibited from having devices which ``lock-on''the operating controls.Under the proposed rule, the standard would have prohibited the presence,as well as the use, of lock-on devices for each of these classes of powertools. Although commenters agreed that circular and chain saws should notbe equipped with lock-on devices, several commenters objected to the proposal'srequirement to forbid lock-on devices on power drills, disc sanders, andgrinders because many of them are sold with these devices and the proposalwould have required their removal. Commenters suggested that improper removalof the devices could result in increased hazards for persons using thetools in the hand-held mode. Commenters also were concerned that the deviceswere permitted for certain work areas regulated by OSHA, but under theproposal would have been prohibited at mines.The final standard recognizes that many power drills, sanders, and grindersare manufactured with lock-on devices as a standard feature. One reasonthese tools come equipped with lock-on devices is to permit their use inmachine stands. For example, a hand-held drill secured in a machine standcan serve as a drill press. Although the lock-on devices need not be removed,the standard continues to prohibit their use when the tool is operatedin the hand-held mode. Commenters acknowledge the potential for seriousinjury when loss of control occurs. Some manufacturers of these power toolshave also recognized the potential hazards and advise that the lock-onfeature be utilized only when the portable tool is placed in a stationarymachine. By not requiring the lock-on feature to be removed, these powertools can be used in stationary machines at mines and can continue to beused at work sites inspected by OSHA, to the extent permitted by applicablestandards.Some commenters believed that use of a lock-on device could lessen fatiguefor the tool operator. MSHA, however, believes that the devices shouldnot be substituted for rest when the users of power tools become fatigued.<T3>Section 56/57.14130 Roll-over protective structures (ROPS) and seatbelts. </T3>This final standard is derived from and replaces existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9088.It applies only to surface mining equipment, and specifies the types ofequipment which must have roll-over protective structures and seat beltsto protect equipment operators in event of an accident.Many commenters were directed to the scope of equipment covered by thisstandard. Some commenters wanted the standard to include underground equipmentwhile others were opposed to such an extension. A third group wanted toexempt equipment which operates in flat areas.The final standard retains the existing standard's scope and would applyto surface mines and surface areas of underground mines. MSHA's accidentdata does not support requiring ROPS in underground mines. However, accidentdata strongly supports the need for ROPS for surface equipment. From 1983through 1986, 21 miners were killed while operating the type of equipmentaddressed by the roll-over and seat belt protection requirements of thisstandard. In 16 of these fatal accidents the equipment rolled over. In11 instances no roll-over protective structures (ROPS) were provided. In18 of these accidents seat belts were not worn; either because they werenot provided (12) or, were provided but not worn (6). As to the suggestedexemption for flat areas, mining equipment is exposed to varying terrains,and equipment may be susceptible to a roll-over in level or near levelareas under certain conditions, often depending upon the distribution ofthe load on the equipment. The final standard updates the existing standard'sreferences to SAE documents to reflect the most current publications.The terminology used to describe the equipment is taken from the referencedSAE documents, but the rule does not expand the classes of equipment fromthose addressed by the existing rule. In the proposed rule, MSHA publisheda table which compared the existing standard's terminology with the newterminology for these classes of self-propelled mobile equipment. To aidin the transition to this new terminology, the comparison table has beenrepublished in this preamble:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Comparison Table</T4><H1>Current SAE and final rule terminology</H1><H1>Existing standard terminology</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Crawler tractors and crawler loaders<D>Front-end loaders, tractors, and dozers.</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Graders<D/>Motor graders<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wheel loaders and wheel tractors<D>Front-end loaders and tractors.</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">The tractor portion of semi-mounted scrapers, dumpers, water wagons,bottom-dump wagons, rear dump wagons and towed fifth wheel attachments<D>Self-propelled scrapers.</D><P>Off-road wheeled prime movers.</P><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Skid-steer loaders<D/>Front-end loaders<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Agricultural tractors<D>Agricultural tractors.</D></ITAG></ITAG>Commenters questioned whether particular types of equipment would requireROPS. The Comparison Table is intended to assist in answering these questionsand will resolve most matters. For example, one commenter asked whetherfork-lift trucks are required to have ROPS. Since this equipment is notlisted in the standard or the comparison table, it is not required to haveROPS. The specific SAE documents can also be consulted in resolving particularquestions and MSHA district offices will assist mine operators in thesematters.The standard requires roll-over protective structures (ROPS) and seat beltsfor certain classes of self-propelled mobile equipment. The performancerequirements for these safety devices are based upon technical documentsdeveloped by SAE. These documents are incorporated by reference in thisrule in recognition of the extensive engineering criteria which must beconsidered when constructing and installing roll-over protective structures.ROPS must be able to provide protection from varying forces exerted fromnumerous directions in a roll-over situation. A predictable level of performanceis best provided by construction which meets the specifications of theseSAE documents.Some commenters suggested that the ROPS label information be made availableat the mine as an alternative to affixing it to the structure. This concepthas not been included in the final rule because it could result in a mix-upas to which equipment was matched to a particular model of ROPS. In mostinstances, these labels are secured to the structure by welding, rivetingor some other relatively permanent method. The chance of dislodgment duringequipment use is remote.The proposed rule would have required ROPS to be installed in accordancewith the recommendations of the manufacturer and also specified the gradesof bolts to be used for attachment purposes. Some commenters were concernedthat this provision could result in the use of inappropriate bolts in someinstances. In response to these comments, the final rule does not referto specific bolts since the manufacturer's recommendations will providethe correct grade of bolt to be used.This final standard also requires that ROPS be maintained to assure thatthe performance requirements continue to be met. When a ROPS is subjectedto a roll-over, or abnormal structural loading, either the equipment manufactureror a registered professional engineer with knowledge and experience inROPS design must recertify that the ROPS continues to meet the performancerequirements of this standard. A similar recertification would also bein order if the ROPS undergoes modifications or repairs for any other reason.Several manufacturers of ROPS stated that proper repairs or alterationsrequire knowledge as to how the specific type of ROPS performs during plasticdeformation. Some of these commenters believed that only manufacturersshould be permitted to make repairs, while other commenters believed thatengineers with the experience described above were fully qualified. Plasticdeformation relates to the designed partial collapse of some ROPS duringa roll-over or abnormal structural loading, in order to absorb some ofthe impact from those events. Sometimes a ROPS may outwardly appear tobe sound after such an event while having undergone subtle damaging effectsto its integrity. In the final rule, MSHA has retained the provision allowingregistered engineers with knowledge and experience in ROPS design to certifythat the ROPS complies with the standard. This knowledge and experienceshould include, where applicable, information relating to performance ofthe specific type of ROPS during plastic deformation.The final rule continues the existing exemption for equipment manufacturedprior to July 1, 1969, since much of that equipment could not structurallysupport ROPS.Some commenters were concerned that ROPS which were acceptable under theexisting standard would no longer be in compliance. The final standard'supdated references apply only as of the effective date of this rule. Thestandard's new requirement applies to ROPS installed after the effectivedate of this rule. Equipment currently in compliance under existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9088 will continue to be in full compliance with the new standardas long as the affected piece of equipment remains in service.Commenters also addressed the requirement for equipment operators to wearseat belts. Many commenters supported this provision. Others noted thatits successful implementation will require educational efforts and, insome intances, disciplinary sanctions for failure to abide by the provision.To address commenters' concerns and after reviewing the above statistics,the final rule requires that seat belts be worn by the equipment operator.Some commenters also urged that an exception be permitted for situationswhen the equipment operator needs to stand in order to operate the equipment.Graders and loaders were cited as examples of equipment which require theoperator to stand occasionally. MSHA has reviewed these concerns but concludesthat a harness and safety line must be used in the limited instances whereequipment operators might be required to stand while operating the equipment.Standing exposes the equipment operator to a higher risk of losing controlof the equipment and falling from it. Commenters noted that in many instancesequipment operators have been run over by their own equipment after jumpingor falling off. Assisting equipment operators in maintaining control ofthe equipment by keeping the operator seated and in command of the equipment'scontrols diminishes the potential for a roll-over. Therefore, where operatorsmust stand, the standard requires that a harness and safety line be used.Standing should rarely be required since the controls on graders and loadersare designed to be properly operated from a seated position.Many comments were directed to the requirement for seat belts. The proposedrule referenced a single document for seat belts, SAE J386, April 1980,which requires equipment operators to wear seat belts. The final standardincorporates by reference, SAE's latest publication, SAE J386, ``OperatorRestraint Systems for Off-Road Work Machines'', 1985.Some commenters believed that the standard should also add SAE documentJ 1194 for agricultural tractor seat belts. MSHA agrees and the final ruleincludes this reference.The final standard also provides that belts shall be maintained in functionalcondition, and replaced when necessary to assure proper performance.Commenters also stated ``that it would be extremely difficult to keep seatbelts `free' from grease, oil, or other deteriorating agents as proposed''.The final rule deletes this requirement for clean belts but retains thecriteria for maintenance and replacement of seat belts. <T3>Section 56/57.14131 Seat belts for surface haulage trucks. </T3>Thisnew standard requires that seat belts be provided and worn in haulage trucksat surface mines and surface areas of underground mines. Under the existingandSection;andSection;56/57.9088, seat belts are required only for equipmentwhich was provided with ROPS. Commenters stated that the seat belt requirementshould be expanded to include haulage trucks. At the public hearings, commenterscontinued to advocate this position and they cited the occurrence of manyfatalities involving haulage trucks which may have been avoided had seatbelts been present and in use. No commenters were opposed to requiringseat belts for haulage trucks.MSHA agrees that seat belts in haulage trucks would save lives providedthat they were appropriate for the equipment in which they were installed.A review of 308 accidents from 1982 to 1984, involving off-highway truckswith seat belts, indicates that 130 were related to the nonuse of seatbelts, including 6 fatalities. Therefore, the final rule adds haulage trucksas a category of equipment for which seat belts are required and specifiesthat the belts meet SAE requirements. MSHA expects that this requirementwill have only a minimal cost effect since, as stated by one equipmentmanufacturer at the public hearings, seat belts are a standard featureon such equipment whether ROPS are present or not.<T3>Section 56/57.14132 Horns and backup alarms for surface equipment.</T3>This revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9087. It requires thatmanually-operated horns or other audible warning devices provided on self-propelledmobile equipment be maintained in a functional manner. It is applicableto surface mines and surface areas of underground mines only, because theconstruction of load, haul, dump vehicles generally used underground, issuch that the view to the rear is less likely to be obstructed. The standardprotects persons from the hazard of backing equipment when the equipmentoperator's view to the rear is obstructed. Where there is an obstructedview, reverse movement alarms or the presence of an observer is required.This revised standard clarifies the application of the horn and backupalarm requirements, provides alternative compliance methods and exemptsrail equipment.Horns are provided on self-propelled mobile equipment for several purposes.An equipment operator may sound a horn to signal that equipment motionis imminent. The operator may also need to warn nearby persons of the presenceof the moving equipment in their work area. Horns are also sounded to attractthe attention of other equipment operators in the area when a collisionmay be likely to occur. Equipment manufacturers evalute the need for hornson self-propelled mobile equipment as part of the design process and takeinto account factors which include: The size and operating speed of theequipment; the operating noise of the equipment and other equipment inthe area; the likelihood that persons traveling on foot might be in thearea; and the presence or absence of a cab or enclosure on the affectedequipment or nearby equipment.Standards 56/57.9087 required that these audible warning devices be providedon all ``heavy duty'' mobile equipment. ``Heavy duty'' was not defined,and application of the horn requirement was a source of confusion and controversy.During the rulemaking process, commenters suggested that ``certain typesof equipment be exempted from the rule if it is small, slow-moving, providegood visibility for the operator, is track equipment operated at extremelyslow speeds coupled with high engine noise, or is not equipped with hornsand would have to be retrofitted.''Several commenters felt that a horn was not necessary so long as the operator'sview to the front was not obstructed. MSHA believes that the equipmentoperator's good visibility to the front does not negate the need for afunctioning horn since persons on foot or aboard other equipment may needto be warned of a developing hazard.The Agency recognizes that many of the commenters' concerns are taken intoaccount by equipment designers when determining whether or not a horn shouldbe provided on a specific type of self-propelled mobile equipment. Thefinal rule, therefore does not require that a horn be installed on specifictypes of equipment. However, where a horn is provided as a design featureon a piece of equipment it must be maintained in functional condition.The standard also addresses situations where the equipment is operatedin a reverse direction with the operator's view to the rear obstructed.Under these circumstances, reverse movement alrams or the presence of anobserver is required. Existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9087, requires anautomatic reverse signal alarm which is audible above the surrounding noiselevel or an observer to signal when it was safe to back up. The final ruleretains these two alternatives and provides additional compliance methodswhich have been developed in recent years.Wheel-mounted bell alarms are permitted provided they sound at least oncefor each three feet of reverse movement. Bell alarms are appropriate andeffective in some instances because they do not rely upon an electricalsource for initiation. In muddy conditions, however, they can become cloggedand rendered useless. Mine operators must evaluate roadway conditions attheir mine site to determine whether bell alarms would be appropriate.Recent advances in backup alarm technology have resulted in the developmentof discriminating backup alarms, commonly referred to as proximity devices,which are an acceptable compliance alternative under the revised standardprovided that they offer coverage of the entire ``blind area''. These discriminatingbackup alarm systems employ infrared light, ultrasonics or radar and thealarm is activated only when a person or object is detected in the obstructedarea of view. Ultrasonic and radar systems have been found to provide moreeffective coverage of the ``blind area''. One of the advantages of thesenew systems is the fact that the alarm is sounded only when a hazard exists,rather than every time equipment is put in reverse. The constant soundingof a conventional backup alarm system may become an accustomed sound ofthe mining environment and therefore be less noticeable and effective asa warning. Additional information on discriminating backup alarms is availablefrom the Bureau of Mines, 2401 E Street NW., Washington, DC, 20241 (seeTechnology News Bulletin No. 255, August, 1986, and Information CircularNo. 9079, 1986).All audible reverse alarm systems acceptable as complying with this standardmust be sufficiently loud to be heard above the surrounding noise level.MSHA has received numerous petitions for modification of the audible backupalarm requirement from mining operations which are located near residentialareas and operate on multiple shifts. In these instances, mine operatorsrequested that they be allowed to use reverse-activated strobe lights inorder to comply with local noise ordinances. Strobe lights are effectiveas warning devices under darkened conditions. The final rule provides thatthese strobe lights may be used in place of audible alarms during nightoperations only.<T3>Section 57.14160 Mantrip trolley wire hazards underground. </T3>Thisfinal standard appears as proposed. No comments were received. It is derivedfrom existing andSection; 57.9115, and is applicable underground only. Itprovides protection for miners being transported on trolley-powered mantripsby requiring that the mantrip be covered if there is a danger of personscontacting the energized trolley wire.<T3>Section 57.14161 Makeshift couplings.</T3> This final standard appearsas proposed since no comments were received. It is derived from existingandSection; 57.9098, and is applicable underground only. It addresses thehazards which exist when improper devices are used for connecting individualcars or components of a train. Couplings other than those designed forthe specific equipment are permitted only during the movement of disabledrail equipment provided that no hazard to persons is created.<T3>Section 57.14162 Trip lights. </T3>This final standard appears as proposedsince no comments were received. It is derived from existing andSection;57.9112, and is applicable underground only. It provides for a visiblesignal in the darkened underground environment as an indication to minersthat passing trains have cleared their area and that backing trains areapproaching.<ITAG tagnum="81">Safety Practices And Operational Procedures</ITAG><T3>Section 56/57.14200 Warnings prior to starting or moving equipment.</T3>This final standard revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9005.It requires that equipment operators give an effective warning prior tostarting crushers and before moving self-propelled equipment.Commenters were concerned about the scope of the proposed standard sinceit did not specify the types of equipment to which it applied. They alsonoted that some types of equipment would need to be started in order toactuate the warning devices.The final standard specifies that it applies to self-propelled mobile equipmentand crushers. It also clarifies that a warning must be given before startinga crusher and before moving the equipment.<T3>Section 56/57.14201 Conveyor start-up warning. </T3>This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9006. It addresses the concernthat persons be clear of conveyors before they are started. As with theexisting standard, the final standard provides that in situations wherethe conveyor operator can observe the entire lenth of the conveyor fromthe starting switch, a visual check is required to make certain that personsare in the clear. Where the conveyor operator cannot view the entire conveyorlength from the starting switch, a system which provides visible or audiblewarning of the impending conveyor movement is required. The final standardalso requires that the warning must be repeated if conveyor motion doesnot occur within 30 seconds after the warning is given.Commenters questioned how the standard would be applied for multi-conveyorsystems. Whether a single belt or several belts are involved in the conveyorsystem, the deciding factor in determining whether a visual check or awarning device is required is the ability of the conveyor operator to seethe entire length of the conveyor from the starting switch. Where the entirelength cannot be seen, the warning device is required.Some commenters believed the 30-second interval between the warning andthe start of the conveyor is too short and recommended a 60-second intervalbe permitted to allow multiple belt systems sufficient time to start. MSHAhas retained the 30 second interval to assure that the warning will beeffective. Longer intervals may result in a lapse of attention or disregardof the warning. In most instances, belt systems will be able to start within30 seconds after the warning is given. MSHA believes that in the few instanceswhere systems take longer to start, improved safety will be provided byrepeating the warning when motion does not begin within 30 seconds.The standard does not specify the minimum amount of time between the warningand the conveyor start-up. Sufficient time must be allowed, however, foraffected persons to leave the hazardous area.<T3>Section 56/57.14202 Manual cleaning of conveyor pulleys. </T3>Thisfinal standard renumbers, but otherwise does not change, existing andSection;andSection;56/57.14033. Commenters supported the retention of this standard whichprohibits manual cleaning of conveyor pulleys when the conveyor is in motionto prevent entanglement of persons in the pulleys.<T3>Section 56/57.14203 Application of belt dressing.</T3> This final standardreplaces and clarifies existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14034. As withthe existing standard, the final standard prohibits the manual applicationof belt dressing while belts are in motion except where a pressurized-typeapplicator is used that does not require reaching inside the guards.Some commenters believed that any applicator which does not require reachinginside the guard should be permitted. MSHA did not adopt this suggestionbecause only pressurized belt dressing applicators afford protection fromthe risk of persons or the applicator becoming ensnared by belt movement.Because this standard applies only to the manual application of belt dressing,it does nor restrict the use of mechanical means of application, such asdrip-type devices.<T3>Section 56/57.14204 Machinery lubrication. </T3>This final standardreplaces and revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14035. Manual lubricationof machinery while it is in motion often exposes persons to a risk of harm.Serious injuries have occurred when persons have attempted to apply lubricantfrom outside a guard by using a hand-held extension, such as a stick coatedwith lubricant. For these reasons, the final standard continues to prohibitthe manual lubrication of machinery while it is in motion, where applicationof the lubricant may expose persons to injury.The existing standard and the proposed standard specifically allowed forlubrication of operating machinery through the use of extended fittingsand cups. This provision has been removed from the final standard at thesuggestion of commenters because it is unnecessary. The performance-orientedlanguage of the final standard allows for the use of these types of devicessince they do not expose persons to the hazards addressed.<T3>Section 56/57.14205 Machinery, equipment, and tools. </T3>This finalstandard makes editorial changes to existing andSection; 56/57.14036. Some commenters considered the requirement to use machinery, equipment,and tools according to the manufacturer's specifications and instructionsas proposed in andSection; 58.14208, to be unrealistic in some mining situations.They proposed that this standard be deleted. MSHA agrees that the manufacturers'specifications and instructions could go beyond the intent of this regulation.However, MSHA notes that serious mining accidents can occur from the misuseof equipment. For example, haulage trucks can be loaded beyond their designcapacity, and braking and suspension systems can fail. MSHA has therefore,retained the requirement that machinery, equipment, and tools shall notbe used beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer where suchuse may create a hazard to persons. This final standard permits mine operators to modify the machinery, equipment,or tools they purchase from manufacturers to suit their particular miningneeds provided that hazards to persons aren't created. Overloading of equipment,such as haulage vehicles and cranes, that can create a hazard to equipmentoperators and other persons in the area would not be permitted by thisstandard.  Some commenters also considered this standard to be duplicative of andSection;56/57.14200 (defects affecting the safe operation of machinery, equipment,or tools). The focus of this standard is the safe use and modificationof mining equipment while andSection; 56/57.14200 address defective equipment.Defects may exist or develop in equipment even when used within the designcapacity intended by the manufacturers or when it has been modified safely. <T3>Section 56/57.14206 Securing movable parts.</T3> This final standardconsolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9031 and 56/57.9032. Togetherthese standards address safety procedures to be followed to secure movableparts when moving equipment between work areas, and when this type of equipmentis unattended or not in use.  Paragraph (a) addresses the procedures to be used when moving this equipmentbetween workplaces. Commenters believed the standard should recognize thatthe extent to which a movable part needs to be secured depends on the typeof equipment involved. These commenters were concerned that the proposedrules's requirement for movable parts to be secured in a safe travel positioncould imply type of physical or mechanical restraint system in each instance.The final rule clarifies that the movable part is to be positioned in thetravel mode. Mechanical securing would only be necessary when requiredfor safe travel. For example, when a drill mast or boom is mounted on apiece of mobile equipment it would be insufficient to only place the boomin its travel mode. The drill mast would also need to be mechanically securedto prevent it from moving about during travel between workplaces. In contrast,securing a bulldozer blade would require lowering of the blade to the normaltravel position.  Paragraph (b), which addresses the procedures for securing these movableparts when equipment is unattended or not in use, has also been clarifiedin the final rule to reflect that the method of securing depends upon themovable part involved. In each instance the objective is to prevent movementof the movable part when it could create a hazard to persons.  <T3>Section 56/57.14207 Parking procedures for unattended equipment. </T3>Thisfinal standard consolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9036 and56/57.9037 and sets forth the procedures to be followed to prevent mobileequipment from moving when left unattended. Whenever equipment is unattended,the standard requires that the controls be placed in the park positionand the parking brake, if provided on the equipment, be set. In addition,when mobile equipment is parked on a grade, the wheels or tracks must alsobe either chocked or turned into bank or rib. Except for an editorial changedeleting the reference to the underground term ``rib'' in Part 56, thefinal standard adopts the wording of the proposed standard.  Several comments were directed to the proposed standard's requirement forsetting the parking brake. Some commenters stated that they experiencedcontinual maintenance problems with parking brakes because employees chronicallyforget to disengage them before moving equipment. Others stated that maintenanceproblems with parking brakes develop from the failure to use them. Thesecommenters believed that it would be better to save the parking brake foremergency situations. As an alternative, they suggested having the vehiclecut a ditch in the road or be turned into a berm or rib. They also believedthat it was unnecessary to apply the parking brake when the vehicle wason level ground. MSHA has considered each of these viewpoints, but believesthat parking brakes should be fully utilized for their intended purpose.Although a parking brake might be engaged as a last resort to provide anadditional means of slowing a vehicle in an emergency situation, it isnot designed or intended for that purpose. Parking brakes are intendedfor the purpose of keeping stopped equipment stationary. In contrast, manytypes of self-propelled mobile equipment used in mining are designed withan emergency braking system that is distinct from the parking brake. Manufacturersadvise, in their equipment operating instructions, that parking brakesare to be applied any time the equipment is stopped and is to remain stationary.In some instances vehicle manufacturing design prevents starting of theequipment unless the brake is engaged.  The requirement for application of the parking brake applies regardlessof whether a level surface or a grade is involved. In some situations itwould be difficult to accurately detect whether the surface is level oron a grade which may cause a vehicle to overcome its own rolling resistance.Grades as little as one to three percent can cause a vehicle to overcomeits own inertia. In those limited situations where training is ineffectiveto remind employees to disengage the parking brake before moving vehicles,warning lights or an inter-lock system that prevents equipment from movinguntil the brake is released can be installed. Commenters also asked MSHA to explain the standard's requirement to placethe operating controls in the park position. These commenters noted thatplacing the controls in neutral is the park position for some vehicles,while low gear is used for others. Due to these variations, MSHA used theterm ``park position'' to convey that the controls are to be placed inthe position recommended by the manufacturer when equipment is unattended.<T3>Section 56/57.14208 Warning devices. </T3>This final standard consolidatesexisting andSection;andSection; 56/57.9049 and 56/57.9068, The proposed standardaddressed the need for warning devices in three distinct situations involvingmobile equipment. It required warning devices when parked mobile equipmentcreates a hazard to persons in vehicles; when mobile equipment is carryingextended loads; and when restricted clearances create a hazard to personsin mobile equipment. During the realignment of standards within SubpartsH and M, it became apparent that the third situation, restricted clearances,addressed warnings which would be located on roadways, railroads, and loadingand dumping sites rather than warnings affixed to the machinery and equipment.This requirement was, therefore, transferred to Subpart H as andSection;andSection;56/57.9306. Warnings on parked mobile equipment and extended loads beingtransported on equipment are retained within this final standard.Paragraph (a) is derived from existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9068 andrequires that visible warning devices be used when parked mobile equipmentcreates a hazard to persons in vehicles. Warning devices are required whenthe location of a parked vehicle poses a risk that a moving piece of equipmentmay strike it. The warning device alerts the operator of the moving equipmentof the presence and hazardous location of the parked equipment.Paragraph (b) is derived from existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9049. Thefinal standard provides that when mobile equipment has loads that extendbeyond its sides, or more than four feet beyond its rear, warning flags,or where visibility is limited, warning lights, must be at the end of theprojection. Commenters believed the standard should permit the alternativeof allowing persons to walk alongside the extended load, carrying the warningflag or light. MSHA agrees and the final standard permits this procedure.Although some commenters believed the standard should only require warningflags or lights when visibility is limited, MSHA has retained these requirementsfor all instances involving extended loads. Even where visibility is notlimited, the fact that a load is extended may not always be readily recognizable.The warning device serves to alert other persons of this condition andacts as a depth perception aid.Commenters also suggested that the standard permit a vehicle to travelbehind an extended load as an alternative to the flag or light. The requirementto provide a warning flag or light is a standard safety practice regardlessof whether a vehicle with an extended load would be traveling on a minesite or highway. Since the warning flag or light also serves as a perceptionaid, even to a trailing vehicle, MSHA believes that the warning deviceis still needed on the projecting loads in those instances.Commenters also suggested that rail equipment be excluded on the basisthat andSection;andSection; 56/57.9330 address those hazards. Under this finalstandard, rail equipment continues to be covered because the same hazardsto persons exist with regard to the equipment, regardless of the type ofwheels or tracks used.<T3>Section 56/57.14209 Safety procedures for towing. </T3>This final standardreplaces existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9070. It sets forth the safetyprocedures to be followed when a piece of equipment is being towed. Thefinal standard clarifies the requirements of the existing standard by statingthe practices required to ensure that the towed piece of equipment remainsunder control.The standard requires that a tow bar or other effective means of controlbe used for towing. In addition to this primary rigging, a safety chainor wire rope must be used as a secondary control mechanism, unless thereis a person on the towed piece of equipment who has control over its brakingand steering. One commenter asked MSHA to clarify whether the tongue ofa utility trailer would constitute the primary rigging. Primary riggingrefers to the principal means of connection between the towing and towedequipment. For a trailer, this would typically be the tongue. In each instance,the principal consideration is the use of an effective primary means ofcontrol in conjunction with a secondary mechanism to control the towedequipment should the primary connection fail.Commenters also questioned whether this standard would apply when smalltrailers are being towed at slow speeds. These procedures apply whenevermobile equipment is being towed, since the potential for loss of controlalways exists.Procedures for moving rail equipment are contained in andSection;andSection;56/57.14218.<T3>Section 56/57.14210 Movement of dippers, buckets, loading booms, orsuspended loads. </T3>This final standard is derived from existing andSection;andSection;56/57.9025. It prohibits dippers, buckets, loading booms, or suspendedloads from being located over the operators' stations of self-propelledmobile equipment until the equipment operator is out of the station andin a safe location. However, an exception was provided for equipment thatis specifically designed to protect the equipment operator from fallingobjects. Commenters supported the wording of the proposed standard andit is unchanged in this final standard.<T3>Section 56/57.14211 Blocking equipment in a raised position. </T3>Thisfinal standard is derived from existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14030.Because of the realignment of standards, the standard is now retained inSubpart M.When persons work on top of, under, or from mobile equipment in a raisedposition, or a raised portion of that equipment, there is a hazard thatthe raised portion may descend without warning. Miners have been seriouslyinjured or killed when raised equipment or raised components of equipmenthave fallen unexpectedly. This standard sets forth safety requirementsthat are intended to prevent these occurrences.Several aspects of the proposal have been clarified in the final rule.Although commenters recognized that this standard addresses both raisedmobile equipment and raised components of such equipment, they requestedclarification and stated that the standard should separate these differentaspects. The final standard does this by providing separate paragraphs.Paragraph (a) addresses the situation when the mobile equipment itselfhas been raised and persons are working on top of, under, or working fromit to reach objects that are otherwise not accessible. In those situations,the equipment must be blocked or mechanically secured to prevent it fromaccidentally rolling or falling.Paragraph (b) provides the same requirement to block or mechanically securea raised component on a piece of mobile equipment when persons are workingon top of, under, or working from it. In addition, when work on a raisedcomponent is being performed, the mobile equipment itself must be blockedor secured to prevent it from rolling.Commenters asked whether it was necessary to block the raised componentif work is being performed on an entirely separate component. The finalstandard clarifies, in paragraph (c), that securing must be done if personsare exposed to the hazard of accidental lowering of the component.Paragraph (d) provides a compliance alternative for blocking of raisedcomponents. Elevated mobile work platforms and other types of equipmentprovided with functional load-locking devices or devices that prevent freeand uncontrolled descent need not be blocked against falling. As discussedduring the public hearings, load-locking devices work by fixing the raisedcomponent in position to prevent it from an unplanned descent. The devicescan operate mechanically or hydraulically. The final standard also permitsuse of any other device that prevents free and uncontrolled descent shouldthere be a sudden failure of the system that is holding up the raised component.An example of this type of device would be a check valve or flow restrictorwhich provides a controlled drift-down rate.Some commenters stated that ``the standard should permit persons to workfrom the buckets of front-end loaders when performing quick repairs, therebyavoiding the need to use specifically designed mobile work platforms''.MSHA does not believe this use of loader buckets is safe unless the bucketsare provided with a device that controls descent. As noted by other commenters,loaders are designed to handle ore and materials and are not intended tobe used as work platforms. Unstable footing inside the loader bucket andthe potential for accidental unloading by the relatively quick-action dumpingmechanism of the bucket make front-end loaders unsafe as makeshift mobilework platforms, unless a load-locking device, or other device that preventsfree and uncontrolled descent is installed on the equipment. In those instances,the equipment would be effectively modified to be considered a specificallydesigned mobile work platform.Similarly, a forklift truck with an attached work basket and load-lockingdevice would be permitted.Although some commenters favored having the standard only address the hazardsassociated with raised components, MSHA's experience has been that manyaccidents and fatalities have occurred when the mobile equipment itselfis raised and it has not been sufficiently secured to prevent accidentalrolling or falling.A few commenters also questioned the requirement for blocking the mobileequipment when a component is raised if the equipment is on level ground.Even when it is possible to assure that the equipment is on level ground,blocking is a sound precaution. At times, work from the raised componentmay cause the mobile equipment to move due to drive line slack or the shiftingof the elevated weight. There is also a possibility that another vehiclemay bump the equipment. Blocking the mobile equipment provides an elementof additional security for these situations. Editorially, the final standardsubstitutes the words ``on top of'' for ``on'' in referring to work performedon the mobile equipment or its raised component. Commenters suggested thischange to permit persons to perform non-hazardous activities such as changingbits on a lowered boom of a jumbo drill when standing to the side of theboom. Paragraph (c) also recognizes these non-hazardous situations, byrequiring the securing of raised components only when persons are exposedto the hazard of accidental lowering.Another issue raised by commenters was whether cranes would be specificallyexcluded from the scope of this standard. Some commenters favored suchan exclusion, preferring to have a separate rulemaking for cranes. Othersbelieved that while cable systems on cranes should be excluded, hydraulicsystems on cranes should be included. They stated that equipment such asa crane, which uses a hydraulic telescoping boom with a cable on the end,or a cherry picker should have load-locking devices on the hydraulic systemportion when they are used as elevated mobile work platforms.If a crane is modified to be used as a mobile work platform, then it alsomust comply with paragraph (d) of this standard and have either a load-lockingor an anti-free-descent device installed. These devices were also acceptedas compliance with the existing standards.<T3>Section 56/57.14212 Chains, ropes and drive belts. </T3>This finalstandard consolidates and replaces existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14031and 56/57.14032. It addresses the hand and arm injuries which can occurwhen chain, rope, or drive belts are moved onto sprockets, pulleys or drumswhile in motion. The standard requires that these chains, ropes, and drivebelts be guided mechanically unless the equipment has been specificallydesigned for hand feeding. Commenters supported the consolidation of thesestandards.<T3>Section 56/57.14213 Ventilation and shielding for welding. </T3>Thisfinal standard revises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.14045. As withthe existing standard, this final standard requires that welding operationsbe well-ventilated. It also clarifies that shielding must be provided wherearc flash could be hazardous to persons. Without the protection providedby shielding, the intensity of light from arc flash can damage the eyesightof persons exposed. Shielding also provides protection from metals beingprojected during welding.Welding fumes and gases are created as a direct by-product of the workactivity and as a result, unlimited amounts of these harmful fumes andgases are continuously released into the work environment during weldingin a manner which could impair visibility. For these reasons the standardrequires that the welding area be well-ventilated to remove the fumes andgases from the work environment. This is especially important where thewelding is carried out in confined spaces.One commenter suggested that the ventilation requirement be deleted onthe basis that the air quality standards address this hazard. MSHA hasretained the welding ventilation requirement of this standard in the finalrule because of the always present fumes and gases from welding, in areaswhich are not well-ventilated. The accumulation of welding fumes and gasescan present a safety hazard by impairing visibility of the welder and otherworkers in the area if no ventilation is provided. If inhaled, weldingfumes and gases can rapidly lead to disorientation and irreversible physicalharm to the welder.<T3>Section 56/57.14214 Train warnings. </T3>This final standard, revisesexisting andSection;andSection; 56/57.9009 and sets forth situations when trainoperators are required to sound an audible warning.A commenter questioned whether a switch engine would be considered a trainif no railcar were attached. The hazard to persons exists when locomotivesare moved individually as well as when they are coupled to railcars. Thestandard is applicable in both situations.<T3>Section 56/57.14215 Coupling or uncoupling cars. </T3>This final standard,consolidates existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9065 and 57.9097. It setsforth the safety procedures to be followed when coupling or uncouplingrailcars so that persons will not be injured by the movement of the trainor be placed in a hazardous position while performing the coupling or uncoupling.Some commenters suggested that this standard be deleted from Part 56 onthe basis that it was not applicable to surface mining operations. However,the final standard continues to apply to both Part 56 and Part 57 sincesome surface operations use rail haulage.<T3>Section 56/57.14216 Backpoling. </T3>This final standard, prohibitsbackpoling of trolleys except where it is unavoidable due to inadequateclearance to reverse the trolley pole. It retains the substantive requirementsof existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9046. Backpoling is the practice ofmoving a trolley wire-powered train with the trolley pole pointed in thedirection of movement rather than trailing the movement. When backpoling,the pole is more likely to become disengaged from the trolley wire or tocatch an object and break. Miners have been electrocuted from such backpolinghazards. The final rule prohibits this practice except where it is absolutelyunavoidable. Where backpoling is necessary, the standard provides thatit be done only at the minimum tram speed of the trolley.Some commenters believed this standard was not applicable to surface miningoperations. MSHA recognizes that trolleys are more commonly encounteredat underground mines; however, they are used at some surface operations.In either setting, the hazards of backpoling exist. Therefore, the finalstandard continues to apply to surface as well as underground mining operations.<T3>Section 56/57.14217 Securing parked railcars. </T3>This final standardrevises existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9047. It is applicable to surfaceand underground mines and provides protection for miners against unintendedmovement of railcars. No comments were received on this standard and itappears in the final rule as proposed. <T3>Section 56/57.14218 Movement of equipment on adjacent tracks. </T3>Thisfinal standard replaces existing andSection;andSection; 56/57.9066. It is applicableto surface and underground mines and requires that any connective devicesbetween a locomotive on one track and rail equipment on another track beof sufficient strength for the task. When inappropriate connecting devicesare used to move rail equipment, the device can fail during movement andthe uncontrolled rail equipment can pose a hazard to miners in the area.No comments were received on this standard and it appears in the finalrule as proposed. <T3>Section 56/57.14219 Brakeman signals. </T3>This final standard replacesexisting andSection;andSection; 56/57.9052. It is applicable to surface andunderground mines and requires that when communicative signals cannot beclearly understood they shall be interpreted as a stop signal so that theinstructions can be verified and train movement can proceed safely. Nocomments were received on this standard and it appears in the final ruleas proposed.I. Derivation Table. The following derivation table lists the number of each standard in bothsubparts of the final rule, the number of the standard in the applicableproposed rule, and the number of the existing

Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>In accordance with Executive Order 12291, MSHA has prepared an analysisto identify potential costs and benefits associated with the revisionsto the Agency's standards for machinery and equipment and for loading,hauling, and dumping at metal and nonmetal mines. The Agency has incorporatedthis analysis into the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis required by theRegulatory Flexibility Act. The Agency prepared a separate analysis foreach of Subpart H and Subpart M. Because of the interrelationship betweenthese two subparts, however, MSHA has combined these separate analysesin the summary below. MSHA has determined that the final rule will neitherresult in major cost increases nor have a combined effect of $100 millionor more annually on the economy. Because the final rule does not meet thecriteria for a major rule, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary.The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that, in developing regulatoryproposals, agencies evaluate and include, wherever possible, compliancealternatives which minimize any adverse impact on small businesses. Forpurposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, MSHA has defined small businessentities as mining operations with fewer than 20 employees. The final rulecontains several alternatives to the existing regulations, some of whichwill especially benefit small operations. In addition, the final rule clarifiescompliance responsibilities, updates standards to reflect advances in technology,adopts more performance-oriented criteria, and transfers standards to moreappropriate subparts. Performance-oriented standards maximize flexibilityby establishing safety objectives without limiting the means to achievethem.The primary benefit of the final rule, however, is the improved protectionthat the standards will provide to persons who could be endangered by hazardsassociated with loading, hauling, and dumping activities and the use ofmachinery and equipment. During the five year period from January 1983through December 1987, the metal and nonmetal mining industry experienced316 work-related fatalities. Fifty two percent (164) of these fatalitieswere directly related to haulage accidents and mishaps in the use of machineryand equipment. The Health and Safety Analysis Center of the Agency hascategorized these 164 deaths as follows: Powered haulage_104; nonpoweredhaulage_2; machinery_55; and, handtools_3. Twenty five of these incidentsoccurred in underground mines; 139 at surface operations. The Agency anticipatesthat full compliance with these improved standards will prevent between10 and 15 fatalities on an annual basis.In the following summary of the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, MSHA hascompared the costs and benefits associated with the final rule with thecosts of the existing requirements. A copy of the full analysis for SubpartH and for Subpart M is available upon request.In developing cost estimates, the Agency has taken into consideration industry-widesafety practices. Current compliance costs are related to the requirementsfor labor and equipment purchase and maintenance. In calculating the costsof the existing requirements and the final rule, the Agency annualizedcapital expenditures and included annual operating costs.MSHA estimates that the annualized capital costs and operating costs forcompliance with the existing requirements amount to approximately $36.1million, compared to approximately $37.4 million for the final rule. Thefinal rule represents a $1.3 million (3.5%) increase in annual compliancecosts over the existing standards. One final standard contributes new compliancecosts of about $18,590 for the installation of seat belts on surface haulagetrucks. Revision of two existing requirements, for testing brakes and replacingcab windows, increases compliance costs by $1,376,731 under the final rule.Revision of three existing requirements, for makeshift couplings, for recordsof examinations, and for warnings prior to starting equipment, decreasescompliance costs by $114,890 under the final rule. In addition, under thefinal rule, 38 standards do not pose compliance costs and 37 standardsimpose the same compliance costs as under the existing rule.The final rule affects about 11,290 metal and nonmetal mining operationsemploying about 189,101 miners. About 84% of the mines or 9,465 are consideredas small business entities and they employ about 31% or 57,704 of the miners.Annual compliance costs under the final rule average about $1,936 per smallmine which represents a 4.9% increase over that required for compliancewith the existing requirements. Small mines incur about 48% of the totalcompliance cost under the existing standard and about 49% of the totalcompliance cost under the final rule. The final rule does not representa significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businessesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Subpart H does not contain any recordkeeping or retention requirementssubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The retention provisionof the recordkeeping requirement in existing standard 56/57.9001, whichis replaced by standard 56/57.14100, would be modified in the final ruleto require that records of equipment defects affecting the safety of self-propelledmobile equipment be retained from the date they are recorded until thedefects are corrected. The recordkeeping burden itself has been modifiedin that only those defects not corrected immediately are required to berecorded.Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB control number 1219-0089.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Front-endloaders shall be tested with the loader bucket empty. Equipment shall notbe tested when carrying hazardous loads, such as explosives.  (ii) The approach shall be sufficient length to allow the equipment operatorto reach and maintain a constant speed between 10 and 20 miles per hourprior to entering the 100 foot measured area. The constant speed shallbe maintained up to the point when the equipment operator receives thesignal to apply the brakes. The roadway shall be wide enought to accommodatethe size of the equipment being tested. The ground shall be generally level,packed, and dry in the braking portion of the test course. Ground moisturemay be present to the extent that it does not adversely affect the brakingsurface.  (iii) Braking is to be performed using only those braking systems, includingauxiliary retarders, which are designed to bring the equipment to a stopunder normal operating conditions. Parking or emergency (secondary) brakesare not to be actuated during the test.  (iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriatefor the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which isdesigned for the power train to be disengaged during braking.  (v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximumof 20 miles per hour. (vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipmentoperator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stoppedposition.  (4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows:  (i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does notexceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performanceof the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be consideredvalid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateralmotion during the braking portion of the test.  (ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initialtest run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additionaltest runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performanceof the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment doesnot exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additionaltests.  (5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipmentis not capable or traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake testswill not be conducted. In such cases, the inspector will rely upon otheravailable evidence to determine whether the service brake system meetsthe performance requirement of this standard. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 56.14102 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Brakes for rail equipment.  </ITAG>Braking systems on railroad cars and locomotives shall be maintained infunctional condition. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;56.14103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Operators stations.  </ITAG>(a) If windows are provided on operators' stations of self-propelled mobileequipment, the windows shall be made of safety glass or material with equivalentsafety characteristics.

Parking or emergency (secondary) brakesare not to be actuated during the test. (iv) The tests shall be conducted with the transmission in the gear appropriatefor the speed the equipment is traveling except for equipment which isdesigned for the power train to be disengaged during braking. (v) Testing speeds shall be a minimum of 10 miles per hour and a maximumof 20 miles per hour. (vi) Stopping distances shall be measured from the point at which the equipmentoperator receives the signal to apply the service brakes to the final stoppedposition. (4) Test results shall be evaluated as follows: (i) If the initial test run is valid and the stopping distance does notexceed the corresponding stopping distance listed in Table 1, the performanceof the service brakes shall be considered acceptable. For tests to be consideredvalid, the equipment shall not slide sideways or exhibit other lateralmotion during the braking portion of the test. (ii) If the equipment exceeds the maximum stopping distance in the initialtest run, the mine operator may request from the inspector up to four additionaltest runs with two runs to be conducted in each direction. The performanceof the service brakes shall be considered acceptable if the equipment doesnot exceed the maximum stopping distance on at least three of the additionaltests. (5) Where there is not an appropriate test site at the mine or the equipmentis not capable of traveling at least 10 miles per hour, service brake testswill not be conducted.
