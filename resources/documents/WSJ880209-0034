Stocks were mixed in Tokyo and slightly higher in Frankfurt.    London share prices were sharply lower at Monday's close, depressed by fear that British interest rates will rise further and worries about the inflationary effects of industrial action by British workers.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 38.1 points at 1349.0. Volume was a modest 395.7 million shares, down from 483.1 million shares Friday. The 100-share index was off 43.3 points at 1694.5.    The market fell steadily through the morning on fear of a further increase in British base lending rates, following last week's half-point rise in minimum lending rates to 9%.    Economists said there was a growing consensus that the British economy is more likely to suffer from higher inflation than from recession during 1988. That suggests the government will prevent any depreciation of the pound with still-higher interest rates, they added.    Inflationary fears were heightened by news of strike action late Sunday at Ford Motor Co.'s British units, where workers have rejected a three-year wage package. The strike follows recent industrial action by British nurses, seamen and coal miners.    Economists were divided on when an interest rate boost might take place. Tim Congdon, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers International Inc., predicted Monday that base lending rates would rise another three percentage points to 12% by mid-1988.    Other economists said another rise in rates was unlikely before the March 15 budget statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.    The Ford action was especially worrisome because of memories of the last industrial action at Ford during the wave of industrial unrest that affected Britain in the late 1970s, said Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities. But the brokerage doesn't expect a further increase in base lending rates before the March 15 budget statement.    Tokyo share prices were narrowly mixed at the end of the afternoon session, as many investors, lacking any incentive to take new positions, moved to the sidelines ahead of U.S. December trade figures due out Friday.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 140.39 points during Saturday's half-day sesion, fell 19.59 to close at 23771.60. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 0.79 point to 1926.94. First section volume was estimated at a light 430 million shares. Volume Saturday was 300 million shares.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, share prices were lower. The Nikkei index fell 103.50 points to 23668.10 at the end of the morning session.    Dealers said few shares Monday posted significant gains or losses outside of a few speculative issues.    Fuji Denki Reiki gained 940 yen to 6,540 ($50) after being untraded because of an excess of buy orders until a little less than the final hour of the afternoon session. The company, a member of the Fuji Electric group, became free to trade on the Tokyo exchange last Monday.    Some traders saw the issue's popularity as a symptom of the lack of incentive to trade in most of the rest of the market.    Dealers said that with the U.S. trade figures due Friday and the market closed for a holiday in Japan Thursday, investors would stay on the sidelines unless spurred by some major market-affecting news. There wasn't any such news Monday, they said.    &quot;Speculative stocks were much in evidence today,&quot; said one trader. &quot;People got bored with so little going on, so they played these.&quot;    Some dealers said the market appears to be entering a period of consolidation following a run-up of more than 2000 points since starting the year at 21560.00.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed slightly higher in listless trading but ended off their earlier peaks.    Equities rose broadly in the first few minutes of trading, boosted by the dollar's jump above 1.7 marks and the continuing decline in interest rates.    But the market gave up most of its gains as follow-up buy orders dried out and trading came to a near standstill.    Small-scale profit-taking also depressed prices in the second half, and most blue-chip issues were nearly back to their opening levels at the end of the session.    Brokers said market sentiment is still geared toward firming, but the bullishness is damped by extreme caution. Investors are waiting to see whether the release of U.S. trade figures, scheduled for Friday, will confirm or reverse the present dollar strength, they say.    Few shares gained more than 3 marks, and retailing and steel stocks had small losses.    Daimler-Benz paced the automobile sector, climbing 5.5 marks to 577.5 ($340), while Bayerische Motoren Werke firmed 2.5 to 501.5, and Volkswagen edged up 0.7 mark to 209.5.    In other European markets, stocks closed higher in Brussels; mixed in Paris, Zurich and Stockholm; and lower in Amsterdam and Milan.    Trading in Milan was moderate and nervous, as last week's convulsions on the exchange left many investors jittery. The retreat hurt stocks in all sectors and continued in more active after-hours dealings, brokers said. They added that prices fell immediately at the opening bell, as investors unloaded blue-chip issues and stock within the Ferruzzi group. Mutual funds were among the biggest sellers of blue chips, traders said.    Share prices closed mixed in Taipei and were lower in Wellington, Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore and Sydney.
