The Food and Drug Administration quietly blessed the saleof lasers for gum surgery last week, the first time thetechnology has been approved for general dentistry. Laterthis year, the agency is expected to approve lasers fortreating cavities, potentially displacing the dentist'sdrill.   The devices won't come cheap, however: Dental lasers areexpected to cost as much as $50,000 apiece.   The lasers, which have undergone five years of clinicaltests, generate an intense, garnet-red light that coursesthrough a fiberoptic thread and is directed by the dentist tothe trouble spot in a patient's mouth. Researchers saylow-power pulses can clear bacterial buildup, slice gumtissue, desensitize aching teeth and zap cavities -- oftenwithout requiring anesthesia.   &quot;It's quick, it's easy and it dramatically lessensbleeding,&quot; says Dr. Joel M. White, an assistant professor atthe University of California at San Francisco who hasconducted extensive clinical trials of lasers. &quot;Thistechnology can now be offered to nearly every patient in thecountry.&quot;   The dental laser has successfully treated thousands ofpatients in clinical trials, and the device has already wonregulatory approval in Canada, Germany, Mexico and Japan. Dr.Terry D. Myers, a consultant to American Dental Laser,Birmingham, Mich., which holds the patents for dental lasers,says that within a decade, &quot;we hope to send the dentist'sdrill to the Smithsonian.&quot;                                                                                                          Meet a CFCs Substitute   That Smells Good, Too                                                                                                          SEVERAL MAJOR electronics companies have embraced anall-natural alternative to ozone-destroying solvents used inthe manufacture of circuit boards.   Electronics companies are among the largest users ofchlorofluorocarbon solvents (CFCs), chemicals that damage theEarth's protective ozone layer.   The natural solvents, known as terpenes, not only are easyon the environment, they smell good, too. &quot;It smells like anorange grove&quot; inside a factory where the solvent is in use,says Lydia Whitefield, a spokeswoman for American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. She says the solvent is being tried at half ofATandamp;T's plants, replacing CFCs, which the company is committedto phase out within four years.   Leslie Guth, a researcher at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories Inc.,Princeton, N.J., explains that some terpene solvents arederived from orange peels -- accounting for the aroma -- andare so benign that they are used in chewing gum and candy.She says they clean circuits effectively and at less cost,though they must be handled carefully because they can beflammable. Ms. Guth says terpenes also may be used in placeof methyl chloroform, which also is suspected of damaging theozone layer.   Vitronics Corp., Newmarket, N.H., says that sales of aterpenebased board-cleaning machine have been brisk. LockheedCorp., Sandia National Labs and a half-dozen other customers,including companies in South Korea and Japan, have investedin the technology, Vitronics says.                                                                                                          Little-Used Channel   Acts as Eyes for Blind                                                                                                          TELEVISION for the blind?   That's exactly what Boston's WGBH-TV has developed, makinguse of a little-used slice of the broadcast spectrum that canbe picked up as a separate audio channel by most new TV sets.   Using this idle channel, known as a subcarrier, WGBHprovides short narrative descriptions of key visual elementsof a program during pauses in the dialogue. &quot;Now they'rekissing, as the sun sets over the ocean,&quot; the vision-impairedaudience might be told.   The free service, available on a variety of programs, iscarried by 35 Public Broadcasting Service stations. Itreflects renewed interest in the so-called separate-audiochannel, which was designated by federal regulators to carryalternate audio and data. Most stereo TVs and videocassetterecorders are equipped to pick up the channel. Older sets canbe inexpensively converted to get the signal with a decoder.   For now, only a few stations are experimenting withsubcarriers, which also can carry computer data. New York'sWNETTV is working on Spanish translations for some nationalnews programming; a Los Angeles TV station already offerslocal newscasts in both English and Spanish. Maryland PublicTelevision uses subcarriers to transmit educational softwareand data to schools for classroom use.   The Electronic Industries Association says that &quot;stationsare getting quite creative&quot; with the subcarrier technology.The association notes that some stations use it to provideextra commentary during sports events, while others use thechannel to carry uncut soundtracks of R-rated movies.                                                                                                          Some Rolling Payments   For Rolls of Customers                                                                                                          LOTUS Development Corp. has devised an unusual payas-you-go feature to bill customers who use its MarketPlacesoftware, a $695 compact disk that contains names, addressesand demographic information on 80 million households and 7.5million businesses.   The program keeps track of each time it is used, like apostal meter. Customers, who use the disk to create mailinglists or tailor marketing efforts, get the first 5,000 namesfree. After that, users call Lotus-credit card in handand pay$400 for each additional 5,000 names.</TEXT></DOC>
