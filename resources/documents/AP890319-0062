Their actions also ended speculation they might boycott theelections because the provisional government of Gen. AndresRodriquez rejected proposals to postpone the elections and makemajor changes in the electoral laws.   At separate weekend conventions the Christian Democrats nominatedSecundino Nunez, a former Roman Catholic priest, and the Febreristasnamed retired economist Fernando Nunez to run for the presidency.   The elections were called by the government of provisionalPresident Rodriguez who led the Feb. 3 military coup that oustedPresident Alfredo Stroessner, an army general who ruled Paraguay fornearly 35 years.   Rodriguez, 65, is the candidate of the governing Colorado Partyand is virtually certain of winning the election against thesplintered opposition.   The Colorados, in power since 1947, also are expected to retaincontrol of the national legislature in the balloting.   The Christian Democrats, Febreristas and Authentic RadicalLiberal Party formed the National Accord alliance to oppose theColorado Party.   The Authentic Radical Liberal Party is to told its conventionMarch 25-26 and if it decides to participate in the balloting it isexpected to nominate former exile and longtime opposition leaderDomingo Laino for president.   Laino addressed party rallies over the weekend and spoke ofirregularities in voter registration. He also said there was thethreat of a ``great fraud'' by the Colorados.   The National Accord had asked the provisional government topostpone the elections for at least two months, to extend voterregistration, to allow coalitions and not just individual parties toback a single candidate, and to revoke the law that gives two-thirdsof the legislative seats to the party that wins the most votes.   Rodriguez' government rejected the appeals to postpone electionsor extend the voter registration period and ignored the otherrequests.   It did remove restrictions that barred the Christian Democratsand Authentic Radicals from participating and gave all legal partiesaccess to the state-run media. The Communist Party remained banned.   Sedundino Nunez, 68, told his Christian Democrats, ``God hasgiven us the circumstances and the people are urging us to act. Wehave to take advantage of the political opening right now.''   He is a professor of theology and anthropology at CatholicUniversity and compared his party's participation in the electionsto a ``long walk through a swamp after someone has rescued you froma deep well.''   ``But must we wait for an angel to come down and clear the wayfor the Christian Democrats to begin to move forward?'' he asked theparty delegates. ``No!'' they shouted back.   Febrerista candidate Fernando Nunez is 65.</TEXT></DOC>
