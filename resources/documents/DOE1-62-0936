<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0936 </DOCNO><TEXT>An adsorption process using silicalite, a hydrophobic molecular sieve,was investigated for the removal of sulfur dioxide from combustion gases.Silicalite, which is a polymorph of silicon dioxide, was found to removeSO/sub 2/ from simulated stack gases to give SO/sub 2/-free effluents.Silicalite adsorbs sulfur dioxide in the presence of major componentsof stack gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.This process has the potential to reduce the sulfur dioxide content ofhot combustion gases before they enter the turbine in a direct coal-firedpower system. The sulfur dioxide adsorption capacity of silicalite wasdetermined at temperatures from 25 to 800{sup 0}C and pressures from1 to 21.4 atm. The breakthrough curves were modeled based on the equationof Bohart and Adams. The adsorption characteristics were evaluated asa function of various parameters which are necessary for the design ofan adsorber. The adsorption-desorption properties of silicalite werecompared with those of active carbon and a zeolite.</TEXT></DOC>
