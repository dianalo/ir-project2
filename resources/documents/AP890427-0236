But two Agriculture Department analysts say this fear is part ofa ``territorial imperative'' that is a reason for some Europeancountries viewing the migration of people from farming areas as athreat to national existence.   As a result, they say, these countries spend lots of money andtake extraordinary steps to keep people on the farms as long aspossible.   Ken Deavers and Dick Long of the department's Economic ResearchService say the United States and Western Europe have a number ofcommon goals as they seek government policies that will enhancerural development.   ``In spite of agriculture's shrinking share of employment and acorresponding decrease in its share of (total economic output),agricultural policy is as difficult to disentangle from ruraldevelopment policy in Europe as it is in the United States,''Deavers said. ``Agricultural and rural well-being are as closelyidentified in the popular mind and political processes of Europe asthey are in the United States.''   Therefore, he said, governments continue to spend huge amountsof money on farm programs ``because they are uncertain about otherintervention strategies to hold population'' in rural areas.   ``However, in spite of their popular appeal, farm programs dolittle to accomplish that goal,'' Deavers said.   Deavers, an economist, and Long, a political scientist, said inthe May issue of Farmline magazine that Americans might recognizethe situation in Europe as similar to their own.   ``Here, despite record-high government ayments to farmers andrecord-high farm income in the middle 1980s, farm-dependent ruralcommunities continue to lose population to metropolitan areas at ornear record rates,'' Deavers said.   But the reasons behind the heavy spending on farm programs varytremendously between the United States and the European EconomicCommunity, for example.   Deavers described territorial imperative as the commitment to aform of economic development that allows people to continue to livein the countryside, if they choose, and still maintain a livingstandard at least close to the national average.   ``The territorial imperative takes forms in Europe that areunfamiliar to Americans,'' he said. ``Europeans are concerned withthe ecological consequences of depopulation, what they calldesertification. Europe has been more densely settled than theUnited States for over a thousand years, and in this European view,much of the territory must be maintained by man in order to protectthe ecology, the natural and social environments, and the beauty ofthe countryside.''   Deavers added: ``Territorial concerns manifest themselves insome European countries, especially in the less-populated north, asimportant to national defense _ the need to have people in remoteareas to assure that a potential enemy does not encroach unobservedon the borders.''   In the United States, he said, ``territorial imperative is lesstied to the maintenance of the countryside and more to the economicviability of rural communities, and the plight of those who mustmove to make a living.''   Deavers said that when people move from rural areas of theUnited States those left behind see it as a threat to their way oflife. ``Parents are distressed by the prospect of separation fromtheir children and granchildren, and elected officials see theirconstituencies and electoral bases eroding,'' he said.   Politicians have deplored the loss of people from U.S. ruralareas, but ``legislation creating rural development programs hasrarely corresponded to the rhetoric,'' he said. ``There are noprograms specifically helping only places experiencingout-migration.''   For example, he said, laws creating the Economic DevelopmentAdministration in the Commerce Department did not specificallydirect its assistance at such areas.   ``Nor did the laws creating any of the Farmers HomeAdministration rural development programs,'' Deavers added. ``Ourbasic agricultural policies have supported the mechanization andconsolidation of farming, facilitating the rapid loss of farmpopulation and the decline of many farming communities.''   Between 1950 and 1985, he said, the U.S. farm populationdeclined by an estimated 17.7 million people.   ``Nevertheless, until the emergence of serious urban stresses inthe 1960s, especially the riots of that decade, there wassurprisingly little talk about out-migration or rural depopulationas a major problem,'' Deavers said.   In Europe, meanwhile, leaders have matched the rhetoric and haveadded new programs that are designed to keep the rural populationin place.   Long, the political scientist, that if anything, westernEuropean leaders and governments ``are even more articulate aboutthe territorial imperative.''   For example, he said, the 21-nation Council of Europe recentlyconducted a ``campaign for the countryside,'' which included afocus on ``disadvantaged rural areas threatened by depopulation,economic decline and a diminishing quality of life.''   Rural problems sometimes permeate European politics, reflectingagriculture's ``comparatively great'' political muscle, Long said.One reason for such strength is a version of syndicalism practicedin in many European countries which gives quasi-official status tovarious organizations of tradesmen, producers and craftsmen.   In the case of agriculture, Long said, one farmers' organizationin France, for example, is designated as the officialrepresentative for all farmers in that country.   The practice in the United States is for each farm and commodityorganization to speak for itself, although various coalitions havebeen formed from time to time as issues develop.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 30</NOTE></DOC>
