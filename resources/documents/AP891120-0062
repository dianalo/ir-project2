The country's Roman Catholic leader predicted a backlash of``revenge, repression and witch-hunting,'' and was himselfthreatened with assassination.   National Guard troops raided the Episcopal church just afterdawn and arrested several foreigners, said a guard officer whorefused to give his name. A church worker said nine people,including an American and Spanish, French and West German citizens,were picked up. He did not elaborate.   The church, in one of the most affluent neighborhoods of thecapital, is harboring about 200 refugees from the combat.   Churches, especially those that work with the poor, have alwaysbeen suspect in the eyes of Salvadoran rightists. Authoritiesbelieve they harbor or aid guerrillas.   Troops from the elite Belloso battalion today fought guerrillasin the working-class neighborhood of Soyapango on the east side ofthe capital. But guerrillas had pulled out of most of the territorythey seized during the offensive that began Nov. 11, and returnedto mountain strongholds.   There also were reports of scattered combat in the provinces.Telephones were out in San Miguel, a city 86 miles east of thecapital where there was heavy combat Sunday night.   On Sunday, army patrols moved through streets strewn with therubble of fighting. On some vehicles, several burned bodies couldbe seen.   People began returning to their homes, or what was left of them,but thousands remained in shelters. The warfare had forced about40,000 of the capital's 1 million people to evacuate homes innow-ravaged neighborhoods.   About 800 mourners attended the funeral of six Jesuit priests,their cook and her teen-age daughter, who were slain and mutilatedearly Thursday in an attack widely blamed on right-wing deathsquads.   The United States has pressed rightist President AlfredoCristiani for a full investigation. In Washington, Sen. ChristopherDodd, D-Conn., warned Sunday that U.S. aid could be curtailed ifCristiani cannot stop such killings.   But today President Bush said he disagreed with the idea ofcutting aid.   ``There is a freely elected government doing their very besttrying to get protection from these Marxist-led guerrillas,'' Bushsaid in Washington. ``This is not the time to pull away fromPresident Christiani.''   The rebels said they launched the offensive in response to aresurgence of death squad activity and many people think Cristianihas lost control over the military and extremists in his party, theRepublican Nationalist Alliance.   Many opposition politicians, labor leaders, religious and humanrights activists are now in hiding or have left the country becauseof threats or arrests followed by deportation orders.   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas, the Catholic leader, warned inhis homily Sunday that ``a dreadful wave of revenge, repression andwitch hunting may follow'' the guerrilla withdrawal.   Rivera Damas said before Sunday's funeral that ``there existsthe vehement presumption'' that the six Jesuits were killed by``members of the armed forces or people in intimate connivance withthem.''   The archbishop, whose predecessor Oscar Romero was slain in 1980by a right-wing death squad, has been urged to leave the country byAttorney General Mauricio Colorado.   Colorado told a news conference Sunday that the unnamed ``churchdignitaries'' he asked Pope John Paul II to withdraw were RiveraDamas and Auxiliary Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, whom he accused offomenting leftist violence.   He claimed he had information that both have been targeted forassassination.   In attendance at Sunday's funeral were U.S. Ambassador WilliamWalker and Cristiani, who is struggling to maintain the appearanceof control.   The political polarization has raised questions about thesuccess of a U.S. policy that made this nation of 5.2 million thebiggest recipient of Washington's aid in the hemisphere.   Despite the billions, human rights abuses are again on the riseand a rebel force of 7,000 regulars and perhaps twice as manyirregulars was able to bring the decade-old war to the capital forthe first time.   They took about a third of the capital in the first assault andheld onto extensive areas for most of a week, also engaging inheavy combat in the provinces. On Sunday evening, there were stillisolated pockets of fighting in the capital.   The military said nearly 1,000 soldiers and guerrillas werekilled and more than 1,150 wounded in the nationwide rebeloffensive. About 71,000 people have died overall in the war, mostof them civilians.   Radio Venceremos, the rebels' clandestine radio station, claimed827 soldiers were killed or wounded but gave no breakdown.   Neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians, whosuffered heavily in the block-by-block fighting. The Red Cross saidan estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in thestreets.</TEXT></DOC>
