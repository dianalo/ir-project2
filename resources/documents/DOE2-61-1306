<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-1306 </DOCNO><TEXT>A technique developed by Mobil Oil Corporation was used to determine thecurrent estimate of the world's undiscovered, recoverable conventionaloil. The method of assessment includes an economic assessment and isdetermined by basin and play analysis. Results compare to historic valuesfor the entire world along with cumulative production and reserves. Amore detailed breakdown of world values for undiscovered conventionaloil, cumulative production, and total discovered oil is given by continentand, where pertinent, by country. In terms of undiscovered oil, a furtherestimate is made for accessible oil, which is oil located such that currenttechnology may be used. Other oil sources, such as EOR, tar deposits,and oil shales, are reviewed and an estimate for the contribution eachwill make to ultimate world oil recovery is given. These data are frompublished reports. The final analysis details the ultimate recovery ofeach continent or country in terms of conventional oil and oil derivedfrom tar deposits, EOR, and oil shales. Economics is not a considerationin this analysis. The world's estimated ultimate oil recovery, less cumulativeproduction, is divided by current annual consumption to give a time periodfor oil availability.</TEXT></DOC>
