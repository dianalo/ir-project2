Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, the government soonwill begin issuing allowances to emit sulfur dioxide, thepollutant that creates acid rain.</LP><TEXT>   These allowances will strictly limit the quantity ofsulfur dioxide that each utility is allowed to emit, with aninnovative twist: Utilities will be allowed to buy and sellthese allowances as if they were securities. For example, acompany with low-grade sulfur dioxide emissions wouldn't needthe government allowances and could make a profit by sellingthem to a company that did.   In essence, the Board of Trade is seeking to perform thesame function for these allowances that the U.S. TreasuryDepartment performs in selling government bonds. &quot;If we'reselected to do this, we would dole the allowances out to thebest bidder, like the Treasury does with T-Bonds,&quot; said anexchange spokesman.   CBOT directors voted yesterday to approve a 30-pageproposal that outlines how the exchange would run a &quot;spot&quot;market in the allowances, and submit it for EPAconsideration.   The environmental agency has solicited such proposals fromparties interested in running markets in its allowances, witha Feb. 21 deadline for submissions. Among the other financialmarkets said to be interested in running emission-allowancemarkets are the New York Mercantile Exchange and the AmericanStock Exchange.   The CBOT's interest in running a spot market in theallowances derives from an idea hatched by exchange directorRichard L. Sandor, a longtime futures industry innovator, whohas proposed trading futures contracts based on theallowances.   Any futures market in a given commodity, even anunconventional one like permits to pollute, must be based onan underlying spot market. Though it doesn't now run the spotmarket in any commodity, the Board of Trade used to run largespot markets for various kinds of grain.   It remains unclear exactly how the government will issuethe allowances. The Board of Trade's proposal calls forauctioning the allowances on an annual basis and thenadministering a day-to-day market in which utilities couldtrade them.   But it's also possible that the EPA will decide to simplyissue the allowances directly to utilities. In this lattercase, the function of the spot market would be merely toallow polluters to exchange the allowances once thegovernment had issued them.   The allowances probably will be substantially cheaper thaninstalling expensive emissions-control equipment, which cancost a utility millions of dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
