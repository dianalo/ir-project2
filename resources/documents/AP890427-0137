Also on Thursday, an advisory board recommended an overhaul ofpolitical fund-raising regulations to avoid the type of conflict ofinterest and influence-peddling charges that destroyed Takeshita'scareer.   A separate panel urged all lawmakers be banned from stocktrading, make public disclosures of their assets and stoptraditional gifts of money at funeral and weddings.   Under intense political pressure, Takeshita took responsibilityTuesday for a bribery and influence-peddling scandal and said hewill resign after final passage of the budget.   That has prompted the governing Liberal Democrats to rushlegislation through Parliament over an opposition boycott anddespite Japan's traditional emphasis on consensus.   The party-dominated Budget Committee of the lower house rammedthrough approval of the budget in one minute Thursday, and partyleaders are expected to push the issue through the full lower houseon Friday.   That means Takeshita apparently will step down in May. Thebudget automatically goes into effect within 30 days of lower houseapproval if not rejected by the upper house. The governing LiberalDemocrats have a majority in both houses.   Opposition party leaders denounced the rushed committee vote asan act of desperation.   ``This outrage treads parliamentary democracy under foot andcannot be forgiven,'' said lawmaker Shun Oide of the SocialistParty, the leading opposition party.   The budget action ``is the final act of political hari-kari forTakeshita,'' said political analyst and author Asao Yamaguchi. ``Heis offering himself as a sacrifice, but this will just increase thepeople's distrust of the Liberal Democrats.''   The opposition has boycotted budget debate, demanding newparliamentary elections and a broad investigation of the scandalsurrounding the purchase by business and political leaders ofunlisted shares in a subsidiary of the Recruit Co., an informationand publishing conglomerate. The shares soared in value when theywent on the market.   Prosecutors contend at least some of the stock transactionsamounted to bribery by Recruit to try to influence governmentpolicy. Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested onbribery and securities law violation charges.   The company also made huge political donations. Takeshitaacknowledged receiving more than $1 million in donations.   While a panel of the prime minister recommended new rules onfund-raising, another panel of members of the private and academicsectors recommended widespread changes in Japan's big-moneypolitics, including requiring all legislators to disclose theirassets and stop traditional monetary gifts.   Only Cabinet members now must divulge their assets. There are norestrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on stocks, andpoliticians routinely spend huge sums on wedding and funeralofferings to their constituents.   Analysts say Masayoshi Ito, 75, head of the Liberal Democrats'Executive Council and a former foreign minister, will likelyreplace Takeshita and lead a caretaker government.   Ito told reporters Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi _Takeshita's main lieutenant _ asked him early Thursday to acceptTakeshita's job.   Later Thursday, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported Itoreceived the backing of his party faction, headed by former FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa.   Ito has insisted he will not accept the post due to a heartcondition caused by diabetes. Many analysts say his public denialsare a facade.   ``It would be un-Japanese for him to come out and say he'll takethe job,'' said Keiichiro Nakamura, an aide to former PrimeMinister Takeo Miki. Nakamura said Ito will accept once ``theproper atmosphere has been created.''   The party was shocked Wednesday by the suicide of a Takeshitaaide who handled the prime minister's political funds. Stockdealings and a $384,000 loan from Recruit were carried out in thename of the aide, Ihei Aoki.   Aoki was among more than a dozen politicians and political aideswho profited from Recruit stock. More than 150 political, businessand media figures purchased such shares.</TEXT></DOC>
