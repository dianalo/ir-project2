(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 1988 Atlantic hurricane seasonbegan today with the National Weather Service already tracking thefirst tropical depression of the year.   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression's center was just south of thewestern tip of Cuba, or about 150 miles southwest of Havana. Thedepression, drifting toward the northeast, contained winds up to 30mph and was not expected to strengthen.   If the system's maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph, it wouldbe called Tropical Storm Alberto.   In conjunction with the start of the six-month season, theweather service released a study estimating that the death tollfrom a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted.   Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal countiesfrom Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrierislands is virtually impossible, said Bob Sheets, director of theNational Hurricane Center.   Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for theAtlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlierthought must be evacuated under certain conditions, Sheets said.   Sheets said there are not enough shelters to handle the addedload. And there are serious concerns how glass-windowed high-riseswould fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during theevacuations.   ``We've not had a strong category three or category fourhurricane of record strike a ... glass city,'' he said. During aweaker hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flyingeverywhere.''   Hurricanes are rated on a one-to-five scale. Five, the mostsevere, has wind speeds exceeding 150 mph.   The Hurricane Center director refused to make predictions aboutthe 1988 season, saying no one has convinced forecasters they canreliably predict the number and severity of the storms.   A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30,sees 10 named tropical storms with rain and winds exceeding 39 mph.Six become hurricanes with drenching rains and winds over 74 mph,said hurricane specialist Bob Case of the Geo-StationaryEarth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite.   In 1987, there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms inthe Atlantic.</TEXT></DOC>
