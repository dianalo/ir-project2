It was, after all, one of those years -- an election year, when the good times always roll and the merest hint of austerity is a no-no of the naughtiest kind.    But the election is over. And yesterday, from financial markets around the world, urgent signals sounded this message: It's time to get down to business.    Just two months after the weak dollar seemed well on the way to recovery, it has relapsed. It fell sharply again yesterday, and stock prices joined it.    The dollar plunged to 1.7166 marks yesterday from a record post-World War II high of 3.47 marks in February 1985. The dollar fell to 122.2 yen, near a record 40-year low, and continued to fall in trading in Tokyo early Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 38.59 points, bringing its overall decline since mid-October to more than 140 points. &quot;The financial markets are having another attack of nerves,&quot; says Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    To those foreign investors whose cash is desperately needed to finance the budget deficit, confidence in Washington's ability to address its problems is waning. &quot;The new administration should make it clear as soon as possible how they will tackle the budget-deficit problem and propose a credible program about how they'll bring it down,&quot; says Aloys Bischofberger, Zurich-based chief economist of Credit Suisse.    Despite his election-campaign pledges to the contrary, &quot;Bush won't be able to avoid a tax increase as well as cut expenditures,&quot; says Manfred Kunert, manager of foreign-exchange operations for DG Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;Ultimately he'll have to convince people there's no way out; the U.S. will have to tighten its belt.&quot;    The markets' anxiety re-emerged only hours after a relatively benign report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for September, which narrowed to $10.46 billion from $12.27 billion in August. The September figure fell within the range that had been expected. With no other financial or economic bombshells in earshot, the Commerce Department report ordinarily would have struck the markets as neutral if not bullish.    But the resurgent pessimism has broader causes. Since early September, when the dollar reached its 1988 peak, the bullish case for U.S. currency has fallen apart, point by point. President-elect George Bush, surprisingly to some, has clung to his repeated promise not to resort to tax increases to shrink the gap between federal revenue and spending. In the financial markets, this serves only to increase doubts that a Bush administration can make any real headway in reducing the deficit and weaning the U.S. from borrowed foreign capital.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan helped focus the issue, too, in testimony before the National Economic Commission yesterday. He called continued inflows of capital borrowed abroad &quot;questionable.&quot; And he again pooh-poohed the notion that federal revenues created solely by economic growth can resolve the budget deficit. His remarks, though hardly new, were seized on by traders in the financial markets.    Actually, the trade deficit is continuing to shrink -- but not fast enough to make traders want to hold dollars very long. &quot;There's no real improvement in the trade deficit,&quot; complains James Hohorst, a top currency trader at Manufacturers Hanover. &quot;We aren't going to $5 billion, or $2 billion, or surplus.&quot;    The spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates also has narrowed, further damping any residual enthusiasm for the dollar. Last summer, U.S. rates were sufficiently higher than those in Japan and West Germany to continue attracting foreign capital and keep the dollar firm.    Economic policy makers here and in the entire Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., Great Britain, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan and Italy -- have reaffirmed their pledge to support the dollar's stability. But traders believe that the central banks of these nations are prepared to endure a further decline, so long as it is gradual. &quot;The Fed isn't in the market {supporting the dollar} aggressively,&quot; a trader at a top West German bank said yesterday. &quot;And the heavy speculators are into selling the dollar.&quot;    Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said last weekend that &quot;the administration remains committed to exchange-rate stability.&quot; And Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson yesterday said &quot;the dollar doesn't need to adjust lower.&quot; Still, Mr. Johnson gave no indication the Fed would increase interest rates to protect the dollar.    A continuing decline in the dollar would help American manufacturers sell their goods abroad. But it would also contribute to inflation, increasing the cost of imported goods to American consumers and encouraging domestic manufacturers to raise their prices as well.    The main guessing game on Wall Street is how much further the dollar will fall. &quot;We're expecting a 10% drop by the end of next year,&quot; says David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. &quot;I'm quite pessimistic,&quot; adds John Paulus, chief economist at Morgan, Stanley andamp; Co. In fact, of eight economists polled by this newspaper yesterday, all but one saw the dollar at lower levels a year from now.    The prospects for the deficits, which are linked to the dollar's value, seem similarly bleak. &quot;If there is no action to take down the budget deficit and the real {U.S.} economy is doing well, the trade deficit will deteriorate further because of higher imports,&quot; says Mr. Bischofberger. &quot;An increase in exports of 25% to 30% {as the U.S. experienced this summer} is just not sustainable because of capacity constraints&quot; on U.S. industry.    Indeed, Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor and former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has continually argued that the U.S. currency must keep falling if the trade deficit is to be constrained. Just last week, he called for a 20% drop in the dollar.    Senior administration officials have said that Mr. Feldstein doesn't speak for the government. But &quot;foreigners undoubtedly hear what he says,&quot; says Geoffrey Dennis, chief economist in the U.S. for the British brokers, James Capel andamp; Co.    &quot;The dollar will remain vulnerable until {the budget and trade} imbalances are solved,&quot; says Mr. Bischofberger. &quot;In the case of fiscal inaction, a sharp drop in the dollar wouldn't be out of the question.&quot;    That, in turn, could force the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. interest rates sharply &quot;to defend the dollar and combat inflation&quot; associated with a weaker U.S. currency, adds the Swiss banker.    Over the last two years, the U.S. budget deficit has declined from $220.9 billion in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30, 1986, to $155.1 billion in the year ended this September. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-reduction program requires that the deficit fall further to $136 billion in the current fiscal year and even more to $100 billion in the year that ends Sept. 30, 1990.    It is the fiscal 1990 budget that the incoming Bush administration will negotiate with Congress next year. That's the worrisome budget. Many expect strained relations between the Republican administration and an even stronger Democratic House of Representatives and Senate to frustrate the job of dealing with it.    A reduction in the budget deficit to $100 billion &quot;isn't an impossible task, but {President Bush} will have to come up with a very, very faithful set of assumptions or the market won't believe him,&quot; says Mr. Dennis. If the U.S. doesn't make progress on the budget deficit, &quot;the dollar's going to 100 yen is really going to be necessary to make big inroads in the trade deficit.&quot;    From all the turmoil, another fact emerges: Once again, the dollar is driving the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. &quot;With nearly a 10% drop in the dollar in recent weeks, it's become a hot topic again,&quot; says Mr. Paulus.    Yesterday began rather calmly for the world's most widely followed currency. The trade-deficit report caused barely a ripple in the markets, but traders began driving the dollar sharply lower after Mr. Greenspan's remarks were reported later.    The dollar's fall against the yen was tempered by what traders described as minimal yen selling by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. There wasn't any intervention to support the U.S. currency against the mark.    &quot;We're going to continue to sell the dollar until the central banks tell us we can't,&quot; said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations at Chase Manhattan Bank.    The props that held the greenback afloat through much of this year up to late August have failed to hold. These included improved U.S. trade statistics, cooperation among the Group of Seven central banks and higher U.S. interest rates that increased the allure of American fixed-income investments. Market professionals also felt that with the U.S. in the midst of a presidential election, Western central bankers would be motivated to avoid a dollar collapse.    The dollar climbed from its early-January record lows of 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks to 135.55 yen and 1.9210 marks in August. But as the election date crept closer, the dollar's underlying diseases began to become more apparent and the financial markets' confidence began to wane.    In the past few weeks, anxiety over the budget deficit has grown. There had been hopes that the bipartisan National Economic Commission would supply a plan to reduce the budget, after the election. But Mr. Bush has given the commission scant attention.    And the dollar's decline has accelerated since his election; it began to fall again even as the results were announced and it became clear he must work with a solidly Democratic Congress. Since Nov. 8 the greenback has lost 5% of its value in marks and 3% of its value in yen.    &quot;If Reagan had trouble with the trade deficit, then Bush with his pledge of no new taxes is probably going to have trouble, too,&quot; says Manufacturers Hanover's Mr. Kellner.    As traders keep dumping dollars, Reagan administration officials worry that the decline is being driven by the markets' appetite for conspiracy theories and for unfounded rumors.    Some traders and analysts have expressed the belief that the dollar was propped before the election to help Mr. Bush win. There also are rumors that the Group of Seven conspired to permit the dollar to slide sharply after the election to cheapen the dollar value of American goods and encourage their export; that would be in contrast to the group's stated pledge to intervene to prevent any calamitous decline in the U.S. currency.    In support of their views, traders say that even intervention by the U.S. over the past few weeks has been half-hearted at best. They estimate that the Fed spent less than $200 million to support the dollar yesterday, a minimal showing in a nervous and apprehensive market. And traders found a bit puzzling Mr. Greenspan's reference to continued foreign capital inflows as &quot;questionable.&quot;    &quot;That surprised us all. That was a hint that foreigners be careful,&quot; says Mr. Kunert of DG Bank. The remark prompted foreigners to sell U.S. securities as well as dollars, he says. And he asks: &quot;Why in bloody hell does he {Greenspan} do that while having the Fed intervene to support the dollar? It's a contradiction in itself. If they want stability in the market, he should keep his trap shut.&quot;    U.S. officials deny any shred of evidence for such theories and rumors, which, they observe, must have profited some traders who sold dollars to gain from further declines. &quot;I know the currency markets are rational in the long run,&quot; says an official. &quot;But in the short run, they can do some pretty bizarre things.&quot;    U.S. officials also believe that some foreigners fail to understand that new U.S. governments don't take charge immediately after an election and that Mr. Bush hasn't yet become president.    But, says Charles Minnaar, a vice president and trader at Chase Manhattan Bank, &quot;That's precisely the point, why you sell right now, because nothing will be done {with the budget and trade deficits} till the new Bush administration takes office.&quot;    The dollar will rally, perhaps even today, and other rallies will occur from time to time, traders believe. But they think that the trend is still downward. &quot;Fundamentally, the dollar has to go down,&quot; says Robert DeFina, economist at Security Pacific Bank. &quot;The trade deficit at current levels isn't sustainable.&quot; A year from now, he says, the dollar may buy only 110 to 115 yen and 1.55 marks.    ---                    Economists See Dollar                    Falling Further in '89   Here is a sampling of forecasts for dollar exchange rates a year from now. Nearly all economists see the U.S. currency sinking below its current level of 122 yen and 1.72 marks.
