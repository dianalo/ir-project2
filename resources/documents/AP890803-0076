John Hull, 69, a U.S.-born Costa Rican rancher, was identifiedby federal prosecutors and the congressional Iran-Contra committeeas a point man in former National Security Council aide OliverNorth's efforts to funnel aid to Nicaraguan rebels.   A Costa Rican investigation resulted in his indictment thereearlier this year for violating that nation's neutrality and drugtrafficking laws, although an investigating judge dismissed thedrug counts Wendesday.   Hull surfaced in Miami Wednesdsay after jumping $37,500 bail inCosta Rica, saying he was seeking medical treatment for a heartailment.   He acknowledged working with the CIA, accepting bodyguards fromthe agency and taking $10,000 a month from a Contra leader, butstrongly denied the landing strips on his Costa Rican farm wereused by drug traffickers.   ``There have never been drugs on any of my air strips,'' Hulltold The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``At this point I canhonestly say I have never even seen cocaine.''   Five witnesses last year told a Senate investigatorysubcommittee headed by U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that drugswere flown through Hull's farm back to the United States on thesame planes that brought in weapons for the Contras. Hull wassubpoenaed by the committee to testify, but never showed up.   Jonathan Winer, counsel to Kerry, said on learning Hull hadreturned to the United States that the subcommittee wanted to talkto him as soon as possible.   ``Hull is under subpoena and has been for a year, and we willseek to serve him,'' Winer said. ``We've sought to serve himbefore, but he has been in Costa Rica, and, from our point of view,evading the subpoena.''   Hull blames the drug charges on a plot by his enemies todiscredit him and U.S. policy in Central America.   ``It's basically a misinformation campaign carried on by thecommunists and drug traffickers as a smokescreen,'' he said. ``Andthe fact is that the communists have to get people like me out ofthe way to subvert the country.''   Hull acknowledges receiving about $10,000 a month from Contraleader Adolfo Calero to feed and supply the rebels on Nicaragua'ssouthern border. But he denies knowing the money was provided onorders from North.   Hull, from Evanston, Ind., denied working for North or theNational Security Council. He admitted meeting with North's aideRob Owen in Costa Rica, but said Owen was simply an ``old friend''he knew through the office of then-Sen. Dan Quayle.</TEXT></DOC>
