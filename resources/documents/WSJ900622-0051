The letter, from Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Morgan StanleyGroup Inc. to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, takes on alifeblood of Wall Street -- &quot;soft dollars.&quot; A barter form ofpayment, soft dollars are credits that pension funds andmutual funds receive from brokerage firms for tradingcommissions. The funds use those credits instead of cash topay for such things as research, computer services,economists and client referrals.</LP><TEXT>   Backers say they help institutions pick and choose theservices they want and allow star Wall Street analysts toform their own boutique firms. But critics counter that thesoft-dollar business is a quagmire, rife with fraud thatforces pensioners to pay for services that fund managersshould be paying themselves. Moreover, Goldman and Morgancontend that soft dollars hurt overall market liquidity andcreate excess volatility.   The letter from the two firms points up Wall Street's riftover the soft-dollar question. Most other brokerages havereluctantly set up their own soft-dollar units on theassumption that failing to do so would force business toother firms. Morgan and Goldman have steadfastly refused toenter the fray, and now appear to be hoping for regulatoryrelief.   The debate over soft dollars has heated up again in thepast few years as volume since the October 1987 stock-marketcrash has remained at sharply lower levels than during themid-1980s. Because large institutions, such as mutual fundsand pension funds, have to reimburse soft-dollar brokers forservices no matter how much volume they do, Wall Street firmswithout soft-dollar operations are getting a proportionatelysmaller share of the pie.   The two firms asked the Labor Department and theSecurities and Exchange Commission to: require pension plansto disclose the extent of soft-dollar deals; clarify thetypes of soft-dollar accords that fall outside pension rules;and then take enforcement action.   The soft-dollar issue isn't likely to fade soon. &quot;Thisgoes to the very heart of what's going on on Wall Street,&quot;said Lee Pickard, a Washington lawyer who represents manysoft-dollar firms. &quot;It's a competitive turf battle.&quot;   The letter and an accompanying report, copies of whichwere obtained by this newspaper, were sent several months agoby Robert Rubin, Goldman's vice chairman, and Richard Fisher,Morgan Stanley's president. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman saidthe Labor Department hasn't formally responded. She said thatthe letter was a follow-up to an SEC roundtable held lastyear on soft dollars, and that Morgan Stanley wanted toexpress concern about the use of soft-dollar accords infixed-income investing. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.   &quot;It's an area we have been interested in for a number ofyears and an area we continue to have interest in,&quot; saidCharles Lerner, director of enforcement at the LaborDepartment's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. Hedeclined to say what the agency might do.   But the reception from the SEC doesn't appear to beparticularly warm. Robert Colby, chief counsel for marketregulation, said the agency has taken a wait-and-see attitudetoward changing the rules on soft dollars. &quot;There's notimetable for deciding when to move on any of thesecomplaints,&quot; he said.   &quot;Obviously for these firms there are competitive concernsthat mingle with altruism and their concerns for theclients,&quot; Mr. Colby said. &quot;That really calls for caution.&quot;   Goldman and Morgan contend in their report that softdollars are a major problem for the markets. They estimatethat 30% to 50% of the total trades on the New York StockExchange use soft dollars.   &quot;The overall consequence of soft-dollar practices on thesecurities markets is a decrease in market liquidity, whichcan lead to increased market volatility and generaldisruption of trading,&quot; the report said. Moreover, softdollars are hurting the return that pension funds are getting&quot;because investment managers are not obtaining best executionof securities trades in transactions involving soft dollars.&quot;   At the heart of the firms' argument is a securities-lawprovision called Section 28e, which allows money managers touse soft-dollar practices if they receive research in return.If the arrangement meets Section 28e guidelines, practicesthat otherwise would violate Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act laws are protected from Labor Departmentenforcement action.   But Morgan and Goldman said that pension-plan sponsorsaren't being told how soft dollars are being used. Moreover,they added that some soft dollars are being used for futurestransactions, in violation of Section 28e, which covers onlysecurities trades.   Some soft-dollar firms argue that Goldman and Morgan aresimply engaged in a misguided campaign of sour grapes. &quot;It'san attempt to restrict competition by lobbying theregulators,&quot; said Don Potts, president of CapitalInstitutional Services Inc., a large independent soft-dollarfirm based in Dallas. &quot;The real problem we're dealing withhere is the overcapacity of Wall Street.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
