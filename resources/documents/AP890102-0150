The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said that as of Jan. 1 Iraq hadstopped trucking 65,000 barrels a day to Jordan's Red Sea port ofAqaba and another 25,000 barrels a day through Turkey.   Meanwhile, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Monday launched amulti-billion deficit budget for fiscal 1989 with a warning thatSaudi Arabia would not be bound by OPEC-fixed oil production quotasif others violated them.   Iraq currently exports 1.5 million barrels a day through apipeline across Turkey to Mediterranean ports, and another 500,000barrels a day through a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Seaport of Yanbu, the agency said.   Iraq's quota, matching that of Iran, was set by the 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at a cartel meeting inVienna in November.   Previously Iran had a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day, comparedto 1.5 million barrels a day for Iraq, which was heavily exceedingits quota.   The former gulf war enemies badly need increased oil revenues inorder to rebuild economies shattered by 8 years of hostilities.   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the official Saudi Press Agency saidbudget outlays for the world's biggest oil-exporting nation wereapproved at a weekly cabinet session chaired by King Fahd.   Expenditures were set at 141 million riyals, or about $37.6billion, against projected revenues of 116 billion riyals, or $30.9billion.   That left a deficit of 25 billion riyals, or $6.7 billion, downfrom 35.9 billion riyals for 1988, to be covered by publicborrowing, the agency said.   Budget deficits have become a chronic problem in Saudi Arabia andother oil-producing nations since crude prices started slipping inthe early 1980s because of a world glut.   The new restrictive OPEC quota system took effect on Sunday in afresh attempt to remedy the situation.   King Fahd stressed the importance of ``discipline and adherence''to the quotas if prices are to improve.   He warned that although Saudi Arabia is ``the first state toabide by what OPEC agrees to... I don't think that anyone can blamethe kingdom if the contract is broken.''   ``We do not want to see that to happen under any circumstancesand it is hoped that the losses suffered by the OPEC states give anidea of what can result from a chaos, as happened a few years agoand again a year ago,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
