The conciliator, Kenneth Swan, said the two sides are far apart and unwilling to compromise on job security, work rules and wages.    He said a strike or lockout could result in &quot;serious violence&quot; if the government-owned postal service presses to continue operating with managers and temporary workers. He also said an interruption in service could result in bankruptcies and a loss of business to money-losing Canada Post. &quot;The stakes are very, very high,&quot; he said in the report.    Mr. Swan declined to make recommendations on the key issues where the two sides are unwilling to compromise, but he called the Canada Post's proposal for a two-tier wage system &quot;unacceptable.&quot;    The postal workers may begin a strike at 12:01 a.m. EDT next Tuesday. Robert McGarry, president of the Letter Carriers Union, has said the union will begin rotating strikes at various locations if the dispute hasn't been resolved by then.    A Canada Post spokesman said that the two sides had agreed to return to the bargaining table last night.    Canada Post has pledged to continue mail delivery by management and temporary workers if there is a strike or lockout. The spokesman said workers affiliated with other unions who refuse to cross picket lines in a strike could be fired. In the past, postal operations have been halted during strikes.    Some political analysts say the government is taking a hard line because the postal unions are unpopular in Canada, and a show of strength could benefit the Progressive Conservative government, which is trailing the major opposition parties in public opinion polls.    Many companies and business associations have advised customers and shareholders of contingency plans for essential communications should a strike occur.    Canada last had a postal strike in 1981, which lasted 42 days. That strike was called by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers. Recently, contract talks between that union, representing 23,000 mail sorters and other personnel, and Canada Post also were referred to a conciliator. The Letter Carriers union has had one brief strike, in 1978, during the 12 years of its existence.    Canada Post, which had a deficit of 184 million Canadian dollars ($137 million) at March 31, 1986, by law must be in a break-even position by next March. The government's position to date is that the contract negotiations are a matter for Canada Post and union to resolve, but it could ease the pressure on Canada Post by giving it more time to become self-sufficient, helping to avert a strike.    The conciliator's report said the letter carriers are asking for a largely &quot;status quo&quot; contract with Canada Post to replace the one that expired Dec. 31, 1986. The company is asking for &quot;dramatic&quot; concessions in order to cut costs, he said. Mr. Swan said Canada Post's demand that new workers be paid at 25% below the current hourly rate is &quot;incomprehensible&quot; because it conflicts with government programs to enhance job opportunities for women and minorities. </TEXT></DOC>
