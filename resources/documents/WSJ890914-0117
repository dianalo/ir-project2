An estimated 4,951,000 people -- only two of every 100 Americans -- were living on farms in 1988, not significantly different from the previous year's tally of 4,986,000.    &quot;More than one year of data showing stability would be needed to confirm this pattern,&quot; the Census Bureau cautioned. It noted that the decline in the farm population appeared to be over in 1984, but then resumed.    The farm population has dropped steadily over the years, falling by more than 14% since 1983. As recently as 1950, 23 million Americans, more than 15% of the population, lived on farms.    The new census report, done jointly with the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, also found that farm residents tend to be older than Americans who live elsewhere. The median age of people living on farms was 38 years, compared with 32.3 years for the nation as a whole.    The government defines a farm as a place in a rural area that sells at least $1,000 a year of agricultural products. The small number of farms in urban areas aren't included. </TEXT></DOC>
