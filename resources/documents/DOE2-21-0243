Some of the disadvantages of such a testing program are theneed for significant investments in personnel, and test equipment, andadditional radiation exposure to workers. Also, traditional testing doesnot adequately fill the need for frequent performance monitoring andits associated quick detection of slight degradations, which often occurbefore major problems arise. An on-line monitoring system complete withdata storage for trending is an ideal tool to achieve the above purpose.Although such systems exist, they require large amounts of capital andsome sort of plant modification to integrate the system with the plant'sexisting process computer. At the Brunswick plant, a similar system hasbeen developed with a minimal investment, using only a personal computer(PC) combined with spread sheet and communications software. A spreadsheet was chosen in lieu of a data-base manager in order to take advantageof several built-in statistical analysis and plotting functions. A communicationspackage is needed to automate the data collection process. The finalproduct of this system is a spread sheet file in which each column containsa related set of data values. Historical data, in a ready-to-be-usedform, can be maintained with minimum effort on a diskette or hard diskdrive. This is a two-step process for which a brief description is provided.</TEXT></DOC>
