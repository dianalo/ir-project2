The formation of the ``civilian-military commission,'' as thegroup calls itself, came as the Contras and Sandinista governmentopened talks at the United Nations aimed at ending the civil war inNicaragua.   The new Contra leaders include three military commanders andAristides Sanchez, a civilian holdover from the old seven-memberdirectorate.   ``The commission was formed by military commanders ... becauseof the disintegration of the the old directorate,'' Contra militaryspokesman Alejandro Acevedo said.   Three of the seven civilian directors have returned toNicaragua, the U.S. has cut off funds to the old directorate, andmost of the Contra supply and demobilization effort is already inthe hands of the military, he said.   Acevedo added that the Contra's U.N. negotiating team hasrecognized the new commission.   But two of the civilian directors, who were elected by theNicaraguan Resistance's 54-member legislative assembly, qucklydenounced the body as a power grab that violated the Contras'internal rules.   ``The intervention of the military in civilian matters hasalways been a great problem in our country,'' said Adolfo Calero,who was a leader of the resistance since it was formed in the early1980s. ``I want respect for insitutions, and for the military tokeep in their headquarters and do their duty.''   Calero blamed the takeover on the State Department, which hesaid had undercut the directorate to favor military commanders.   ``They have a short memory on how the military has screwed upbefore,'' he said.   The State Department did not immediately return calls from TheAssociated Press.   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Wilfredo Montalvan, another civiliandirector, said the new commission was supposed to work under thedirectorate, not replace it.   ``The disbanding of the directorate would violate the statutesof the assembly, and I consider that a coup which creates a seriousprecedent,'' said Montalvan.   Members of the new commission, however, defended the body andsaid it was necessary because the directorate had ceasedfunctioning.   Commander Franklin, the Contra's military chief of staff and amember of the commission, issued a statement saying the goals ofthe movement had not changed. He and the other two militaryleaders, Commanders Ruben and Dimas, are known only by theirbattlefield psuedonyms.   The new leaders will do ``everything necessary to fulfill thehistoric goals of our organization _ achieving peace and nationalreconciliation through the full democratization of Nicaraguansociety,'' Franklin said.   Asked about the old directors, Acevedo noted that if militarycommanders agree, there is an option to expand the commission toseven members, and it is possible former directors could join.   Calero, however, rejected the possibility.   ``I would be doing a disservice to democracy if I approved, andI will not,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
