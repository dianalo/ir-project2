RUBIN</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's largest organization of lawyers wenton record Monday in favor of legislation to bar discriminationagainst homosexuals.   The American Bar Association, which twice before rejected similarproposals, endorsed a resolution supporting federal, state and locallegislation ``prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation in employment, housing and public accommodations.''   The ABA's House of Delegates, the policy-making body for the350,000-member lawyers' organization, voted 251-121 to adopt theresolution.   Members said the action will have important symbolic andpractical impact in influencing lawmakers to adopt gay-rightmeasures.   The House of Delegates also approved, by voice vote, a proposalcalling for increased federal regulation of the insurance industry.   The proposal urges passage of federal legislation repealing theantitrust exemption the insurance industry was granted by Congressin 1945.   The ABA resolution is a response to the so-called liabilitycrisis in which lawyers and insurance companies have blamed eachother for the skyrocketing costs of liability insurance.   Proponents of the gay-rights resolution noted that many statesand cities already have legislation to protect the rights ofhomosexuals.   Many states and cities already have legislation to protect therights of homosexuals.   Laws banning discrimination in public employment based on sexualorientation have been adopted by California, Illinois, Maryland,Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington state. Many cities haveenacted more sweeping protection.   In a debate that was at times emotional, proponents of thegay-rights measure said the ABA is behind the times in speaking outin behalf of homosexual rights.   ``It's a question of basic human rights,'' said Alexander Forger,a lawyer from New York City. ``What we do here today is simply makea statement in favor of decency and human rights, a compassionatevoice for social justice.''   But opponents of the resolution said the ABA is taking sides with``perversion'' and the corruption of children.   The ABA is ``encouraging a federal statute that will invade therights of every American,'' said Augustine Smythe of Charleston, S.C.   ``We shouldn't ram it down people's throats with a federalstatute,'' he said.   Joe Stamper of Antlers, Okla., said the resolution endorseshomosexual conduct. ``A majority of Americans looks with distaste onperversity that violates our religious precepts,'' he said.   The ABA's House of Delegates rejected a similar proposal by ninevotes in 1985 and by 24 votes in 1983. In 1987, the group approved aresolution condemning crimes of violence based on prejudice againstthe victim's race, religion, sexual orientation or minority status.Supporters of the gay-rights proposal emphasized that homosexualityis not a matter of choice for most.   They also said there is no scientific evidence to showhomosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to molest children.   Alice Richmond of Boston said, ``It's important to me to separateout conduct that would be offensive, whether by heterosexuals orhomosexuals.'' She said that when she was in the sixth grade shesucceeded in getting a male teacher fired for making sexual advancesto her. Endorsing equal treatment for homosexuals does not meancondoning conduct that would be offensive or illegal, she said.   Earlier Monday, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called formeasures to limit the time in which death row inmates may challengein federal court their convictions and death sentences.   Rehnquist said such a limit should be combined with expandedlegal help for those accused of capital crimes to ensure thatconstitutional challenges to death penalty sentences are handledmore efficiently.</TEXT></DOC>
