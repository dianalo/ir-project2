For this purpose, the forecasting and diagnosis ondegradation of the equipments is needed. Useful methods for the degradation-forecastinginclude detection of rubbing or abnormalities of the shafts, and partialfailures of the equipments from the vibration pattern of the equipmentsunder operation, and also, the statistical treatment of the present diagnosticresults and the history of the equipments, i.e., on the corrosion, abrasionand erosion. For estimating the life-time of the equipments, the diagnosison the structure, hardness and strength of the equipment materials isexemplified as a useful method. The diagnosis is carried out under equipmentoperation, or under stop of the equipments for inspection and repairing.It is desired to develop on-line equipment diagnosis/detection systemsutilizing sensors, computers.
