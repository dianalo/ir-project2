These were cis(I) and trans[Pt(Me{sub 2}SO)(L)Cl{sub 2}] (II), and cis[Pt(Me{sub 2}SO){sub2}(L)Cl]Cl(III), where L = N3 or N1 bound C or l derivatives, respectively.cis[Pt(Me{sub 2}SO)(L){sub 2}Cl]Cl(IV) and l are stable products whenr andless; 0.5(Pt/L) or r andgt; 0.5, respectively. The {sup 195}Pt NMR spectra ofI-IV were recorded for 24 different Xpy. For each of four complexes thedependence of chemical shift on ligand pK/sub a/ was linear for 4Xpy.When 2X was -C = OR (R = H, Me phenyl) downfield shifts of ca. 100 ppmfrom the 4Xpy pK/sub a/ line were observed.Large upfield shifts wereobserved when 2X was -NR{sub 2}, R = H or alkyl.</TEXT></DOC>
