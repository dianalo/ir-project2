Director Isaac Zepel Yeshuron pronounces his protagonists _ anIsraeli living in the United States, his Berkeley-educated wife andtheir soldier son _guilty of accepting violence as the only way tohandle the rebellion in which more than 540 Arabs have died.   The level of that violence steadily increases in the film, frombeatings to the chilling climax of murder that left some viewerscrying after this week's premiere.   This is the aim of Yeshuron, who wants to break ``that mechanismof both knowing and ignoring created by people who wish to have abearable life.''   ``This movie was made so that things would become known,'' hesaid in an Israel radio interview this week.   Yeshuron's ``Green Fields'' is one of three new Israeli moviesdevoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were screened atthe Jerusalem Film Festival, where 130 films from 44 countries arebeing screened June 29-July 8.   Yehuda Judd Neeman's action-packed ``Streets of Yesterday''portrays an Israeli named Raz becoming entangled in an internationalintrigue involving Palestinian guerrillas, Israel's Mossadintelligence agency and West Germany's secret service. Raz is anIsraeli peace campaigner who helps an Arab friend belonging to aPalestinian guerrilla group. In the end, his friend is shot to deathand he is on the run as an accomplice.   ``End of the Orange Season,'' by director Lihi Hanoch, takes theviewer on a journey with iconoclastic Israeli rock singer ShalomHanoch and his friends through the tense summer of 1988. It is acompendium of protest music generated when the stone-throwing revoltreached its peak and Israeli politicians campaigned in nationalelections that ended in stalemate.   ``Green Fields'' is the most gripping of the Israeli entries,which include a retrospective on the immigration of Iraqi Jews and acomedy on kibbutz life. It is favored to win the $20,000 award forbest Israeli director and producer and the $10,000 prize for themost promising Israeli filmmaker.   The Braverman family _ grandparents, son Shmulik, on a visit withhis American wife, and soldier Rami _ are on their way to an armyceremony in the occupied West Bank.   Hitching a ride in a Jewish settler's van, the Bravermans end upin a Palestinian village under curfew, where masked stone-throwingyouths rule the streets.   As the first stone hits the car, all taboos come loose, and theBravermans act like Israeli soldiers battling the almost 19-monthrebellion.   They beat up a Palestinian youth, forcing him to remove amakeshift stone barricade. Then they tie him to the hood of theircar to avoid being stoned, almost killing the youth in the process.   Rami erupts in violence after capturing another Palestinian whotried to grab a gun. The Jewish settler then calmly shoots the Arabin the leg.   The Bravermans escape and find themselves in the wilderness ofthe West Bank. Shmulik, armed with his son's rifle, forces two Arabsout of a passing jeep he needs to escape.   ``This is a crime,'' one of the Palestinians keeps repeatinguntil Shmulik, driven mad, shoots and kills him.   In addition to Shmulik's blind violence, Yeshuron condemns thegrandparents for whom ``business was as usual.''   He also attacks the wife who cries, not for the persecution ofthe Arabs, ``but for her husband and her marriage falling apart infront of her eyes.''   Rami, he concludes, ``did not recognize that point in space andtime beyond which the killing starts.''</TEXT></DOC>
