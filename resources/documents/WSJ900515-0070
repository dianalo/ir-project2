The subway is not a domain of the privileged and powerful.Rather, it is the primary means of transportation forliterally millions of people of modest means, includinghard-working men and women, students and elderly pensionerswho live in and around New York City and who are dependent onthe subway for the conduct of their daily affairs. They arethe bulk of the subway's patronage, and the City has anobvious interest in providing them with a reasonably safe,propitious and benign means of public transportation.</LP><TEXT>   With these words, federal appeals judges in New York lastweek renounced the idea that there is a constitutional rightto panhandle in subways. District Court Judge Leonard Sandhad established that right in an earlier ruling. The appealscourt said, in essence, that communities of people haveinterests that must be balanced against rights alleged forindividuals. New York is not about to become the City of GoodManners, but a recognition that government has some right toprotect citizens is a big step toward rediscovering civilizedbehavior.   The court's ruling comes as New York teeters on the edgeof some Hobbesian jungle, where the idea of standards ofacceptable behavior begins to sound like a bad joke. Anxiouscrowds wait outside a Brooklyn courthouse to see if the legalsystem is capable of convicting someone for the brutalkilling of a young black man, Yusuf Hawkins, in the whiteneighborhood of Bensonhurst. Over the weekend, near theneighborhood where some Korean grocers are being boycotted, agroup of blacks mistook three Vietnamese immigrants forKoreans and decided to beat them.   As every visitor knows, the subways are a special case.&quot;Begging in the subway,&quot; Federal Appeals Judge Frank Altimariwrote, &quot;often amounts to nothing less than assault, creatingin the passengers the apprehension of imminent danger.&quot; JudgeAltimari emphasized in the opinion for the Second Circuitthat the issue is not the First Amendment, but what societycan do to protect its members. He referred to TransitAuthority studies that indicate passengers find panhandlersthreatening, harassing and inherently aggressive.   Nor is there any reason to draw the line between freespeech and intimidation only after a panhandler pulls aknife. The appeals court said the ban on begging must not beviewed &quot;from the imaginary heights of Mount Olympus . . .lest a rigid, mechanistic application of some legal doctrinegainsays the common good.&quot; The decision added that the lowercourt had an &quot;exacerbated deference to the alleged individualrights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment ofthe common good.&quot;   These are strong words, and it's hard to miss the appealscourt's tone of impatience with Judge Sand's earlier ruling(though it is nothing compared with what many beleagueredsubway riders said the morning after that decision). We thinkthe appeals judges chose their words carefully and with apurpose. They wanted to send a strong message to the activistJudge Sand, who also has been much in the news for attemptingto engineer the public-housing policies of Yonkers, N.Y.   The appeals court detailed how Judge Sand had essentiallyarranged the subway case so that he could issue a broadruling creating a new right. &quot;Not satisfied with the scope ofthe original controversy,&quot; the appeals court wrote, JudgeSand's court &quot;directed that the complaint be amended onnumerous occasions.&quot; On its own, Judge Sand's court contactedthe New York Attorney General, and after he declined tointervene, the court made him a party to the case so that ananti-loitering law would be at issue. &quot;It instructed thatover a dozen defendants be added, and that the class beenlarged to include all needy persons in New York State.&quot;   The subway begging case raises other questions aboutcourts and the common good. The idea that city authoritieshave no power to ban begging of this type suggests how thecommon life of cities deterioriated the past 30 years.   The courts have all but outlawed vagrancy laws asunconstitutional, crippling the police effort to stop drugsales on the street and in public parks. Courts tilt thebalance away from community interests by excluding evidenceof crimes from trials when a lawyer can find a technicalproblem with a search warrant. Communities now endureconvicts back among them on the streets because judgesdecided that jails were &quot;unreasonably&quot; crowded. In New York,Washington, Detroit, Los Angeles and elsewhere, neighborhoodshave become the criminals' punching bags.   It is true that there will always be some conflict betweencommunity interests and individual rights. There is noreason, however, for the Constitution to become a tool in theservice of anarchy. The Preamble itself declares that onereason We the People ordained and established a Constitutionin the first place is to &quot;insure domestic tranquility.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
