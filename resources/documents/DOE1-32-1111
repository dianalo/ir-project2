It reviewsthe three primary evaluation methods used to project the ability of theseoptions to displace conventional power plant construction. By examiningbasic criteria, all of these methods were shown to have shortcomingswhich prevent them from producing ideally integrated least-cost plans.Some applications of these methods fail to follow least-cost principles,while others are hampered by technical barriers which might be overcomewith further research. The report also suggests that process and ex postevaluation methods, which focus on actual program impacts, could alsohelp improve the least-cost planning process. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
