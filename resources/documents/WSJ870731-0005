Despite Reagan's veto threat, the administration sees benefits from trade legislation now going to conference. For one thing, the bill would continue authority to negotiate a new world-wide trade pact. Officials also hope to strip out retaliation requirements and to gain the president more leeway in taking trade actions. But they vow to oppose proposed plant-closing notices.    Democrats insist the final bill will carry their stamp. The Senate will press the House to accept repeal of the windfall-profits tax to make the overall bill harder for Reagan to veto. The bill's leaders, Sen. Bentsen and Rep. Rostenkowski, promise to work with the White House, but, says Bentsen, &quot;they have to remember that negotiation involves give and take on both sides.&quot;    A poll sponsored by the American Medical Association's PAC shows erosion of the public's trust in Republicans as the party to lead on trade issues.    SHULTZ SEEMS SECURE for now, but faces conservatives' wrath.    His allies say he is determined to stay on, particularly with an arms-control pact in sight. Shultz's candid Iran-Contra testimony strengthens his hand with Congress, but its hurrahs won't translate into more policy support. Hard-liners fume at his policy criticisms. If Shultz slips, one State Department official says, &quot;the White House knives will be out for him.&quot;    Reagan hasn't been critical of Shultz's testimony; &quot;George is doing the best he can,&quot; one staffer quotes the president as saying. But one White House official derides Shultz as &quot;the Congress's secretary of state.&quot; And the Conservative Caucus's Howard Phillips, says, &quot;If I were Ronald Reagan and had an ounce of manhood in me, I would get rid of him at the first opportunity.&quot;    DEMOCRATS LOSE MOMENTUM in Congress on a wide range of issues.    &quot;Wright and Byrd have a crisis,&quot; one top Democratic House staffer says of Congress's two top leaders. The pace slows on issues from arms control to the budget. Democrats also split over how to fix the Gramm-Rudman budget law. Tax proposals run into resistance. The Iran-Contra hearings and political attacks on Bork have hurt Democrats with the public so far.    White House aides are cheered by the Democrats' problems. They say chances improve that Bork will be approved. Reagan's veto threats are seen as helping force changes in such bills as catastrophic health insurance. But stalemate is expected on budget measures, which may be rolled into a single bill this fall. That, says GOP Rep. Lott, would be &quot;a formula for disaster.&quot;    Senate Leader Byrd attacks veto threats, saying Democrats won't play &quot;fall guy&quot; to Reagan's &quot;top gun.&quot;    REAGAN AIDES SPLIT over a strategy on Bork. One camp, led by legislative director Will Ball, wants to stress the Supreme Court nominee's credentials and avoid an ideological battle. White House conservatives want Bork to go toe-to-toe with Democrats on social issues. &quot;Here is another potential Ollie North,&quot; says one hard-liner.    CLINTON SHINES at the national governors' meeting. The Arkansas Democrat stands out in policy meetings, then wows colleagues by playing jazz saxophone with the Four Tops. Gephardt courts Clinton, who recently decided not to run for president, by quoting him extensively at a closed meeting with Democratic governors.    EARLY REVIEWS: When a number of labor groups have polled members before showing an AFL-CIO tape with four-minute statements by all of the presidential candidates, Biden and Gephardt have been the favorites. After the tape has been shown, Dukakis and Simon have moved to the top.    MIXED SIGNALS: New Hampshire Republicans wonder if Gov. Sununu, pledged to Bush, may be hedging his bets. A number of top Sununu political aides turn up on du Pont's presidential-campaign staff. Sununu continues to express support for Bush.    AIR SAFETY gets renewed attention in Congress.    Lawmakers are alarmed by reports of near-collisions and of errors by controllers and pilots. A House subcommittee pushes a bill to speed a requirement that all jetliners be equipped with cockpit collision-avoidance devices. The panel also is expected to block, for safety-control reasons, an industry effort to take more repair work abroad.    The Senate may require that all small airplanes be equipped with altitude-reporting equipment; now only those using certain busy airports have to carry it. The Senate aviation subcommittee will explore whether the FAA should be removed from the Transportation Department. A new presidential panel on airline safety plans to conduct hearings across the country.    More air-safety scrutiny is needed, says New Jersey Sen. Lautenberg, because there isn't any such thing &quot;as a midair fender-bender.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Delaware Gov. Castle says his state won't raise its speed limit because by the time you accelerate to 65 miles an hour you're across the border. . . . A proposed &quot;Star Wars&quot; rule by Sen. Bumpers that people, not computers, trigger attacks on missiles is dubbed &quot;PTL,&quot; for People That Launch. . . . Amid preparations for Reagan's visit to Port Washington, Wis., a local pizzeria posts this sign: &quot;I think the Secret Service ate here.&quot; . . . In a report to the Senate, SEC Chairman-designate Ruder lists under memberships &quot;Cub Scouts, 1937.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
