The techniques involve machines that measure the sensitivity offingers to vibration or to a low-level electrical current, said DanMacLeod, whose Minneapolis consulting firm, ErgoTech Inc., isresearching the devices with funding from the meat industry.   MacLeod said the machines promise earlier detection of the firstsymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, a degenerative nerve and muscledisorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and is oftenattributed to the sort of forceful, repetitive motions demanded ofmeatpackers.   ``In the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome, one of the signsis that you lose your sense of feeling in your fingertips,'' MacLeodsaid Thursday in a telephone interview.   ``These things are good for overview screening of people whoshould be referred for diagnosis,'' he said.   Engineers can also use the devices to determine whetherexperimental changes in working positions or equipment designactually protect workers from injury, MacLeod said.   ``It gives us a technology that we can use to see if we're doingany good,'' he said.   Meat industry leaders say they are testing the machines as partof an effort to reduce repetitive-motion injuries, which occur at ahigher rate in their business than in any other.   The American Meat Institute, an industry trade group, is alsoworking with labor and the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration to develop guidelines for making meatpacking plantssafer, said Manly Molpus, the group's president.   ``Let me assure you that OSHA is not the meat industry's enemy.Workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses are our enemies,''Molpus said in remarks prepared for a news conference on Thursday,the first day of the trade group's four-day meeting in Chicago.   Bob Moore, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics saidcumulative trauma disorders, of which repetitive-motion injuries area majority in the meat industry, occured at a rate of 392.3 per10,000 workers in 1987, more than 10 times the rate for generalmanufacturing and nearly 40 times the rate for all private-sectorbusinesses.   Many meatpackers have jobs requiring rapid repetition of cutting,chopping, pulling or lifting motions.   OSHA has levied heavy fines against several meatpackers in recentyears for violating laws designed to protect workers fromrepetitive-motion injuries and other cumulative trauma disorders.   Two of those cases, involving IBP Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., andChicago-based Sara Lee Corp., owner of the meat processer HillshireFarms, led to settlements requiring the companies to implementsafety-improvement plans within three years.   Earlier this year, OSHA said it planned to make the meat industrya model in the use of ergonomics to enhance worker safety. The meatinstitute described ergonomics in a news release as ``the science offitting the job to the worker rather than making the worker fit thejob.''   As part of its plan, OSHA invited the meat industry and labor tohelp prepare guidelines for improving worker safety. OSHA officialshave said they hope to make the guidelines available to the industryby late fall.</TEXT></DOC>
