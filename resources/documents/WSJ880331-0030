The company said the victims have 90 days to take their appeal of the plan to the U.S. Supreme Court.    The plan was confirmed by a bankruptcy court last December. Another appeal by a building-material distributor was rejected in December.    Manville, a Denver-based building and forest-products concern, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in August 1982, when it faced a flood of asbestos-related lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage from exposure to Manville products containing asbestos.    The company said that if the asbestos victims group doesn't take its case to the high court, Manville can emerge from Chapter 11 this summer.    Manville common stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $2.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
