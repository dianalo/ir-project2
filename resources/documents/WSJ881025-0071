The statements, geared mainly to businesses, come with software that does much of the work of reconciling them with customers' records.    A user simply loads his electronic accounting records into his computer along with the monthly disk from the bank. The computer then reads and compares the two sets of data.    The bank-provided software, called Accurex and published by Intuit Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., asks a series of questions on any items that don't match. The program even looks for possible explanations for discrepancies, such as transposed numbers or unmatched recording dates -- though it leaves any corrections to the customer. At the end, the program generates printouts of cleared and returned items, outstanding checks, deposits in transit, bank interest and service charges.    Accurex runs on International Business Machines Corp.'s desktop computers and their clones. It operates with most types of PC accounting software that use the Lotus Development Corp. 1-2-3 data file format.    The software can handle accounts with up to 2,500 transactions a month. Craig Canfield, vice president of First Interstate's commercial market services, says that should meet the needs of 80% to 90% of California companies. Users of the service pay seven cents for each transaction in their accounts.    A Workstation   For Quadriplegics   JEFF BURNETT, an architecture professor at Washington State University, has developed a system that adapts computer workstations for quadriplegics to use in computer-aided design.    Mr. Burnett, with a $64,000 grant from the Easter Seal Society and a desire to help a quadriplegic friend, incorporated standard mouse, voice-recognition and computer-aided design programs into software he wrote called Mousetrap. Cursor movements are controlled by an infrared beam that originates in a box on top of the computer screen and then bounces off a strip of glass-coated tape fastened to the user's forehead.    The system boots up automatically when a wheelchair approaches and serves as a regular telephone when prompted by certain voice commands. Verbal commands also tell the computer to perform drafting tasks like &quot;curve,&quot; &quot;line&quot; and &quot;circle.&quot;    John Pekruhn, a Pittsburgh architect rendered quadriplegic by a degenerative disease, says he can draw &quot;virtually anything&quot; on the system. Mr. Pekruhn, 45 years old, had to stop working four years ago when he could no longer control his hands. But he got a Mousetrap workstation a year ago and is now a lead designer on a number of projects in the Pittsburgh architectural firm of Williams, Trebilcock andamp; Whitehead. His emerging specialty is handicap-accessibility design projects.    Chip Offers Sound   Of Things to Come   ALTHOUGH the &quot;scholar's workstation&quot; introduced last month by Steven Jobs's Next Inc. may be more noteworthy for its sleek appearance than for its technological breakthroughs, the machine features one element that could be a harbinger of things to come in desktop computing.    Mounted on the machine's main circuit board is a microchip called a digital signal processor. The chip, a standard part from Motorola Inc., handles the Next machine's rapid communications and so-called soundware-software that talks, sings or plays music.    Essentially, the chip is a high-powered data cruncher containing three subprocessors that work simultaneously to sift through the massive amounts of data that represent sound. To generate music, the chip processes a user's input and passes the stream of data through a digital-to-analog converter. The analog signal is then turned into sound by a conventional speaker.    To process speech, voice signals are converted from analog to digital and compressed by the chip. The voice's digital essentials can then be stored, using small enough amounts of memory to make practical verbal software-programs that can incorporate voices.    The digital signal processor also speeds computer-to-computer communications. In the Next machine, it can serve as a high-speed modem, transmitting and receiving data simultaneously at eight times the one-way speed of most desktop-computer modems. Future Next computers are expected to use the chips for complex graphics. A small computer-graphics company in San Rafael, Calif., called Pixar Inc. -- also owned by Mr. Jobs -- already uses the technology to generate in just seconds moving images that other computers need hours to draw.    Odds and Ends   AS PART of its effort to spin off technology developed for the space program, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration says it is researching a wearable microcomputer that can analyze speech and flash simultaneous images on eyeglasses to help deaf people communicate. . . . American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories says it has developed a much cheaper and more practical type of heat-detection device using gallium arsenide. Such devices, used in medical imaging, spy satellites and manufacturing processes, currently are made from a costly, unstable compound called mercury cadmium telluride. </TEXT></DOC>
