Unless you consider that original sofa spud, Rip Van Winkle,snoring away on a fluffy recliner. But you surely couldn't count awide-awake Little Red Riding Hood, who tiptoes through a bedroomset into the clutches of the Big Bad Wolf.   Around a typical Post store, neon lighting, Greek columns andhigh-tech mannequins add to the fun.   Post designs stores for the furniture industry the way somepeople design sets for the theater.   ``I knock the socks off customers when they walk in,'' she said.``I feel like I'm playing a game of seduction. ... I'm creating adesire that they want to buy new furniture more than to buy a newcar or go out of the country.''   The Chicago Tribune called Post ``one of the most sought-afterfurniture store designers in the country.'' She grabbed theindustry's attention three years ago after designing Jordan'sFurniture store in Avon, Mass.   Jordan's customers are greeted near the door by larger-than-lifelikenesses of store owners Barry and Eliot Tatelman in an antiquecar. The real-life Tatelmans have video monitors and microphones intheir offices to make their likenesses move and talk to startledshoppers.   The fun continues with a gorilla at a dining room table, freevideo games and a pool table in a store lounge.   ``It's not a typical boring furniture store,'' Barry Tatelmansaid.   Post said clients are sometimes surprised that she's based inWest Virginia.   ``They think everyone in West Virginia has one leg longer thanthe other, drinks moonshine and lives in the coal fields,'' shesaid. ``I think everyone in America failed geography.''</TEXT></DOC>
