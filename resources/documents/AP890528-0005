March leaders said students from up to 300 schools andinstitutes would join the march at various points around thecapital.   One student from Beijing Normal University said the goal of themarch is ``to have Chinese from throughout the world unite'' indemanding that the government grant greater political freedom.   Many carried signs demanding the resignations of Premier LiPeng, who declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, and seniorleader Deng Xiaoping.   Authorities did not try to stop the marchers as they set out.   Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to a million peopleto sprawling Tiananmen square, including thousands of workers,there appeared to be few people who were not students in Sunday'sprocession.   Student leaders said workers would probably stay away.   ``Factories are now taking economic measures against workers whoparticipate,'' one student leader said. Some, he said, have hadtheir pay docked.   However, thousands of people lined the streets and crowded ontooverpasses to cheer on the marchers.   ``Don't stop,'' some in the crowd yelled. ``We won't let youdown,'' students shouted back.         On Saturday, student leaders proposed that demonstrators hold aclimactic rally Tuesday to ``celebrate our great victory'' and thenend their historic two-week occupation of Tiananmen Square.   The call came as hardliners expanded their purge of moderates,whose sympathy for the students triggered the fiercest powerstruggle since the leftist ideological purges of the CulturalRevolution.   Student leaders said it was time to change tactics in their pushfor greater freedom and an end to official corruption. But theysaid protesters in Tiananmen Square, whose numbers had fallensharply to about 10,000, would have the final say on ending thesit-in.   Top student leaders Wu'er Kaixi, Wang Dan and Chai Ling held anews conference at the square and called for a city-wide marchTuesday to culminate the protest movement that began April 15.   Also Saturday, President Li Xiannian made the first publicacknowledgement that China was experiencing a power struggle,accusing some Communist Party leaders of plotting to createconfusion in the country.   Sources said officials in the media, the party and the armysuspected of participating in the protest movement were being toldto write ``reports'' detailing their activities. The reports couldbe used against them, the sources said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The developments came two days after Communist Party leader ZhaoZiyang was reportedly stripped of power and placed under housearrest. Zhao's fall signaled a victory for the 84-year-old Deng andother leaders who oppose political reform.   Zhao's ouster must be confirmed by a meeting of the CentralCommittee of the Communist Party, which is expected soon. Partyofficials from provinces and cities were gathering in Beijing toprepare for the meeting, sources said.   Sources said Zhao has been accused of heading an anti-partyclique.   One diplomat referred to the clique as a ``new Gang of Four,'' areference to ultra-leftist radicals who ruled China during the lastyears of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. They were purged byDeng when he took power in 1978.   Included with Zhao are Politburo member Hu Qili, Vice PremierTian Jiyun and Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, Chinese sources said.   Chinese and diplomatic sources said Qin used his influence tokeep troops in Beijing from enforcing martial law.   Millions of people have taken to the streets in defiance ofmartial law, and Beijing residents put up blockades to preventtroops from entering the city.   Students waiting Saturday at the Beijing railroad station to gohome said they would bring their message out to the countryside.   ``We have to tell the people to arise, including peasants,workers, intellectuals and others from every walk of life,'' said a24-year-old student from Wuhan who asked not to be identified.   Tens of thousands of students have occupied Tiananmen since May13, when they began a hunger strike. But over the past week,thousands have returned to their schools in Beijing and elsewhereand the capital has returned to normal.   ``We just feel the movement is ready to take a new form,'' saidone student. ``We are ready to print newspapers and conductspeeches.''   The student leaders called for April 27 to be made into aholiday commemorating their movement. On that day, hundreds ofthousands marched in Beijing to protest a People's Daily editorialdenouncing the student movement.   In the first public acknowledgement of a power struggle, formerPresident Li Xiannian accused ``certain people in the leadership ofthe Communist Party'' of creating confusion in China, an apparentreference to Zhao.   ``These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' Li wasquoted as saying on television news. ``If they succeed, China willbe thrown into a deep disaster.''   In another blow to Zhao's faction, state-run media said Wan Li,chairman of the standing committee of the National People'sCongress, had thrown his support to conservatives. During a visitto the United States last week, Wan made statements expressingsympathy for the students.   ``After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted assaying in a letter, ``I realized that a small minority was behind aplot to cause turmoil in society.''</TEXT></DOC>
