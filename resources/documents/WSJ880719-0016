It also sparked speculation that those prices could firm, and that prospect helped precious metal prices recover some of their sharp early losses.    Gold futures for August delivery ended at $438.80 an ounce, a decline of $2.50, but well above the day's low of $435.10. September silver rebounded from $7.17 an ounce at one point in the day to settle at $7.2250, or a decline of 16 1/2 cents from Friday, while October platinum was off $3 an ounce at $551.30. It had traded as low as $543.    The trading day began with precious metals prices under pressure from a strong dollar. However, European banks intervened in currency markets, selling dollars and causing the currency's value to ease. This helped stem the decline in precious metals, said John Norris, director of precious metals trading at Citibank in New York.    He added that plunges in soybean and grain futures prices also hurt the precious metal contract prices. Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York, noted that this was because the drop in grain and soybean prices diminished the prospect of inflation. Many investors turn to precious metals as a hedge against inflation.    However, news of Iran's reaction to the UN cease fire resolution &quot;triggered a turnaround in precious metals,&quot; Mr. Norris said. &quot;A settlement of the Iranian-Iraqi war would allow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to come together and possibly agree more readily on production quotas and prices, which could be inflationary,&quot; he said.    Iran has been a divisive element in OPEC, Mr. Hirsch noted, and other members of the group had been putting economic pressure on the nation by driving oil prices lower, penalizing Iran's foreign exchange realization on its oil sales.    &quot;If Iran has indeed accepted a ceasefire, the OPEC problem with it may be over and they can concentrate on strengthening the oil market,&quot; Gerald Commodities' Mr. Hirsch said.    Jerry Rothman, metals broker for Elders Futures, Inc., New York, contended that the decline in August gold had already been stemmed at around $435 before news of the cease-fire came out. &quot;The precious metals market has performed very well despite the pressures it has had on it, and if any inlationary news develops, it could be primed for a rally,&quot; he said.    Vahid Fahti, analyst for Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., Cleveland, saw Iran itself as a potential price-strengthening factor in oil, and as a further inflationary element. &quot;Iran has suffered severe devastation from the war, and its only income is from oil,&quot; Mr. Fahti observed. &quot;There is a period of enormous reconstruction ahead, and those in power will likely be in favor of stronger oil prices, too.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices fell about two-thirds of a point in response to higher oil prices and a lower dollar. &quot;The possible lowering of tensions between Iran and Iraq in the Persian Gulf led to sharply higher oil prices,&quot; said Karen Gibbs, a futures analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Other analysts noted that the dollar yesterday gave back most of the gains it had scored in overnight trading, adding to bond traders' nervousness. Treasury bonds for September delivery closed 5/8 lower at 85 21/32, after trading between 86 1/2 and 85 5/16.    COTTON: Most futures prices fell in sympathy with the drop in grain and soybean prices. The cotton contract for December delivery declined 0.39 cent a pound to 55.88 cents. According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, futures prices have dropped about 13 cents a pound since June 21, when they were over 68 cents. &quot;It was expected there would be a correction after the severe decline, but it hasn't happened because of the weakness of the soybean market,&quot; Mr. Simon said. However, he noted, the December cotton price is approaching its life of contract low of 53.85 cents and that could serve as a key support level.    COFFEE: Futures prices ended mixed after recent easiness. September delivery coffee ended at $1.3547 a pound for a loss of 0.82 cent. Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. noted that last Wednesday the export quotas of producing member countries of the International Coffee Agreement were cut by a total of 1.5 million bags when the International Coffee Organization's average price dipped below $1.15 a pound. A bag weighs 132 pounds. Quota cuts are aimed at supporting prices, but the September futures price has continued to fall, and has dropped about two cents a pound since the cut, Miss Kaul said. If the ICO average remains below $1.15 on July 27, another reduction of 1.5 million bags may take place, the analyst noted. &quot;The market is caught between two forces, the mild weather in Brazil during the July-August frost-prone season -- which is a price-depressant -- and the fact that quota cuts would further tighten already limited supplies of better grades of coffee,&quot; she said. Robusta coffees are in ample supply, she said. Quota cuts already have reduced total export quotas to 53 million bags from the original 58 million at the beginning of the ICO coffee year on Oct. 1, Miss Kual said. </TEXT></DOC>
