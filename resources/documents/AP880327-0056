The government also announced the resignation of Yosef Harmelin,head of the Shin Bet secret service for more than 11 years.   Shamir accepted Nir's resignation two weeks ago and it will takeeffect on April 1, the government announcement said.   The government gave no reasons for the resignation. Mediareports said the reasons were political and not related to theIran-Contra affair.   Nir, a former journalist, was appointed by Labor Party leaderShimon Peres, who became prime minister after the inconclusiveelections in 1984.   In January 1986, Nir became involved in the Iran operation andtook over from three Israeli middlemen _ Foreign Ministry directorDavid Kimche, businessmen Yakov Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer.   Before Nir's involvement, the three mediated a secret 1985 armsdeal between Iran and the United States in exchange for the freedomof U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalists inLebanon.   Israel then shipped 508 U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles and 18Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. The United States took overthe shipments in February 1986 but continued to use Israel as atransfer point for the arms.   In testimony before congressional investigators last July,former U.S. National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver Northlisted Nir as a main mover behind the weapons deals.   North alleged Nir was one of the first to propose divertingfunds from the arms deals to Nicaragua's anti-government rebels,the Contras.   North recently pleaded innocent in federal court in Washington,D.C. to a series of charges in connection with the Iran-Contraaffair.   Since news of the Iranian deals broke, Israel has mantained thatit only acted in cooperation with the United States and denied anyknowledge of alleged diversion of funds to the Contras.   Nir has been sought for questioning by special U.S. prosecutorLawrence E. Walsh. In exchange, Israel has insisted on an agreementthat Nir be granted immunity from prosecution.   Shamir had planned to dismiss Nir in 1986 under a power-sharingagreement with Peres.   Peres, who is currently foreign minister, served as primeminister from 1984-1986 under the accord with Shamir's right-wingLikud Bloc. Shamir took over as prime minister in October 1986.   News reports said that Shamir could not fire Nir in 1986 becausehe feared his dismissal might be interpreted in the United Statesas punishment for Nir's involvement in the weapons' deals.   Harmelin, 65, joined Israel's secret service soon after theJewish state came into being in 1948.   He held various intelligence posts before becoming chief of thesecret service in 1964.   Harmelin was responsible for building Israel's intelligencenetwork in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after Israel captured theselands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   He left the post in 1974 to become Israel's ambassador in Iranand South Africa. In July 1986 he was called back to the secretservice as a temporary replacement for Avraham Shalom-Ahituv, whoresigned after the so-called Shin Bet Affair.   In the affair, Shin Bet agents were accused of fabricatingevidence to conceal their role in the beating deaths of twoPalestinians who hijacked an Israeli passenger bus in April 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
