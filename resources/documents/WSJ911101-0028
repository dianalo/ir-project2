Pledges from the industry are being sought by the end oftoday. Analysts call the drive the largest and most difficulteffort ever mounted to draw quick pledges of support frominsurance companies.</LP><TEXT>   Even if achieved, however, the extraordinary campaign maynot satisfy California regulatory demands for firm newfinancial footing for Executive Life, a unit of FirstExecutive Corp. That could turn bidding for the nation'ssecond-largest insurance failure back to two earlierfront-runners: a French investor group led by Altus Financeor a group led by San Francisco investment bankers Hellman andamp;Friedman.   The call for the $1 billion in backing is at the center ofan effort by the National Organization of Life and HealthGuaranty Associations to satisfy conditions set by CaliforniaInsurance Commissioner John Garamendi, who a week agoprovisionally approved a bid led by the organization toacquire Executive Life.   In a letter sent privately on Monday to leading U.S.insurance companies by J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., an adviser to thenational organization, the funds asked insurers to provide anirrevocable pledge that if the nation's guaranty funds failto provide capital as needed over the next five years, theinsurers individually will provide it. A copy of the letterwas obtained by The Wall Street Journal.   The national organization initially is asking theindustry's largest companies to commit 3% of their capital,as broadly defined, to what it calls the &quot;syndicatedguaranty&quot; to back the Executive Life bid. Big companies thuswould pledge hundreds of millions of dollars.   Analysts said the chance of success for the effort isuncertain. Many companies are looking for additional capitaland thus may be reluctant to commit. &quot;I really don't knowwhat the propensity of these people is to give up surplus inthe current capital crunch; it comes at a bad time,&quot; saidJames Ramenda, managing director at Northington Partners, aninvestment concern in Avon, Conn., specializing in insurance.   Eden D. Sarfaty, president of the national guarantyorganization, said the group's canvassing is &quot;going prettywell.&quot; He declined to be more specific. Mr. Sarfatyreiterated his belief that Mr. Garamendi's conditions for thebid were &quot;gilding the lily,&quot; but said the organization wasmaking every effort to meet Mr. Garamendi's challenges.   Mr. Garamendi asked for assurances that the nationalorganization and its member state guaranty funds could takeover junk bond-laden Executive Life and make good on promisesto credit all policyholders with 89 cents on the dollar.Though terms vary from state to state, insurance guarantyfunds would also have to make good the remaining 11 cents onthe dollar on policy values up to about $100,000 and deathbenefits up to $300,000.   The national association and its member funds, in effect,want their money to do double duty as they promise to bothrecapitalize a renewed Executive Life, which would be namedGalico, and make good on policyholder shortfalls via theguaranty funds.   Analysts have questioned whether the approximately $950million proposed by the organization is enough to backExecutive Life's large portfolio of junk bonds, whose futurevalue is uncertain. There also are substantial questionsabout the legal authority of the guaranty funds to back anoperating insurance company rather than their conventionalobligation to make good on failed policies.   Mr. Garamendi asked the national organization and itsmembers to get back to him by Monday with satisfactoryanswers to the tangle of technical questions.   Even if the organization amasses the $1 billion inindustry backing, there are questions whether that will meetCalifornia's conditions, thus forcing another turn in thecourt-supervised auction for Executive Life.   According to Mr. Garamendi's schedule, which is likely tobe strictly enforced, if the organization and its membersfail to meet the conditions, their bid will be rejected. Mr.Garamendi would then recommend by next Friday either theFrench investor group led by Altus Finance or the group ledby investment bankers Hellman andamp; Friedman to the state courtoverseeing the bidding.   In Monday's letter to insurers, the organization and itsadvisors said: &quot;We believe that the bulk of {Mr. Garamendi's}concerns can be put to rest by provision of a guaranty, orirrevocable backstop facility, that would provide liquidityto Galico in the face of any delays in the {guaranty funds'}assessment or collection process.&quot;   But it is believed that Mr. Garamendi's negotiators haveasked the organization to request that individual companiesdirectly reinsure Executive Life's obligations or fund withcash an escrow account from which funds could be drawn --suggestions apparently quite different from the guarantiesnow being proposed by the organization.   But Mr. Sarfaty said yesterday that the organization'sguaranty plan was in keeping with California's needs. &quot;Wepresented a proposal to the commissioner, which he acceptedon certain terms. He hasn't said that he wants us to turnthat proposal on its head.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
