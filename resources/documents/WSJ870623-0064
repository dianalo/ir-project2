The pound's drop was especially severe, as it skidded 1.4% against the dollar. Traders said speculators had built up sterling positions in anticipation of a rally after Britain's elections June 11, but dumped their holdings when it became clear such a rally wasn't materializing.    Against other major currencies, the dollar was led by investor moves out of Japanese securities, and possible preparations to buy U.S. notes at the Treasury auction this week, market analysts said. &quot;This is auction week. Miraculously, the dollar seems to stabilize against the (Japanese) yen at least every three months,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    The drop in sterling surprised many market participants because of the comparative strength of Britain's economy in Europe. In addition, the Conservative Party government was re-elected this month, with a strong majority. &quot;Economically, there's no reason to sell sterling. It's all emotional,&quot; Anthony J. Murphy, the senior sterling dealer at Royal Bank of Canada, New York, said of yesterday's plunge.    In late New York trading Monday, the pound stood at $1.5878, down from $1.6105 Friday. The British currency also dropped 0.7% to 2.93 West German marks, from 2.95.    What unnerved sterling speculators yesterday was the continued absence of any rally in the currency following Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's re-election victory. &quot;There were expectations that the Japanese were going to come in buying sterling strong after the election. That never materialized. Now there's a huge rush of funds out of sterling,&quot; Mr. Murphy said. &quot;You would think that Labor won, looking at these rates,&quot; he added.    Against the Japanese yen, the dollar climbed 0.9% to 146.20 yen, from 144.83. The dollar also rose 0.9% to 1.8465 marks, from 1.8296.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 146.32 yen.    Traders said that the cash raised from heavy selling in the Tokyo stock and bond markets in the past two sessions got routed into dollars yesterday, and may ultimately be headed for the three-day Treasury note auction beginning today.    The Japanese bond market slumped Monday, &quot;and their equity market isn't looking good. There should be decent demand at the auction this week,&quot; said John D. Hartman, vice president and general manager of foreign exchange, Security Pacific National Bank, New York.    Mr. Hartman added that &quot;some fund managers are reassessing how much of their portfolios they want in yen vs. dollars, and the potential for the dollar to move up.&quot;    The dollar's rise fueled debate among traders and economists over the currency's long-term prospects after its two-year slump. &quot;The dollar has been pretty well bid for several weeks now and the long-term bearishness in the market is dissipating,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank, New York.    Some economists also maintain that the dollar's long decline is over and that recovery is probable, including Mr. Kellner. He cites as bullish factors the narrowing U.S. trade deficit and models based on the theory of purchasing power parity, which identifies exchange rates at which different currencies would buy an identical basket of goods in their respective countries. According to such a model, the dollar should equal 150 yen and 2.10 marks, Mr. Kellner said.    But the dollar still has a large bearish constituency, and hasn't survived above the 1.85 mark level in several attempts since mid-January. &quot;I would rather be selling dollars at these levels, than buying. We're still in a very constrained trading range for the dollar and this is the top of it,&quot; Varick Martin, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $7.60 an ounce to $437.40 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $446.10 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, June 22, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
