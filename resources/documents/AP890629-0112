McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sales of new homes rose 2.7 percent in May asinterest rates continued to fall, the government reported Thursday.But analysts predicted that sales would remain slow because of theweakening economy.   Declining interest rates should produce increased home sales inthe next few months, said Michael Carliner, vice president of theNational Association of Home Builders.   ``However, while interest rates are more favorable now, theeconomy is weaker ... so the response will be less than it wouldbe,'' he said.   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National MortgageAssociation, said slower overall ecnomic growth is a negative forhousing.   ``We're not looking for a surge'' in sales as rates decline,Berson said. ``The improvement will be slow but steady.''   The slower economic growth and high interest rates have resultedfrom the Federal Reserve campaign against inflation. Althoughinterest rates have begun to fall as the central bank appears toease its grip, the economy continues to moderate.   Richard Peach, a Mortgage Bankers Association economist, alsoblames a satiated market for the slow sales pace.   ``We've had several years of generally favorable conditions forhome purchases,'' Peach said. ``We don't have the pent-up demand, sothings are kind of sluggish.''   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homesrose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613,000 units in May,but still trailed the 676,000 rate in 1988 and the 671,000 rate in1987.   For the first five months of the year, new home sales were down7.1 percent from the same period a year earlier.   The May sales increase followed a 9.1 percent jump in April,although the figure was revised downward from the 10.9 percentincrease reported earlier. Sales in February and March had dropped11.3 percent and 11.9 percent respectively after rising 4.6 percentin January.   John A. Tuccillo, an economist with the National Association ofRealtors, said part of May's increase was due to first-time buyersentering the market because of lower interest rates.   Fixed-interest rates have been dropping since March when theypeaked at 11.22 percent. The rates averaged 10.48 percent the lastweek in May and were 10.19 percent last week, according to theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   ``We anticipate the interest rate drops that occurred in Junewill allow more first-time buyers back in, boosting sales of bothnew homes and existing home,'' Tuccillo said.   May's sales rebound was led by the Northeast, which posted a 12.6percent increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 98,000units after falling 20.9 percent in April.   Other increases occurred in the West, up 7.7 percent to a rate of197,000 units after a 28 percent increase in April, and the South,up 2.6 percent to a rate of 234,000 homes after a 16.3 percentincrease a month earlier.   The Midwest had the only decline in sales, off 15.3 percent to anannual rate of 83,000 units. Sales had been flat in the region inApril after falling 4.9 percent to an annual rate of 98,000 homes inMarch.   The median price of homes sold in May rose $9,000, to $125,000.The median price means half the homes sold for more and half forless.   The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensivehomes, rose $13,000, to $158,000.</TEXT></DOC>
