Both in vitro (organ specimens) and in vivo(dogs) experiments have been conducted to determine its efficacy in anumber of areas. There appears to be promise, in these preliminary experiments,of this US contrast agent being used to visualize vessels and enhancetissue in various organs in a fashion similar to x-ray arteriography.In addition, it appears to increase the sensitivity of Doppler US, allowingfor the detection of flow within smaller vessels as well as within vesselshaving slow blood flow.</TEXT></DOC>
