Background</ITAG>In 1958, at the request of the Economic and Social Council of the UnitedNations, the IAEA undertook the development of international regulationsfor the safe transportation of radioactive materials. The initial regulationspublished by the IAEA in 1961 were recommended to member states as thebasis for national regulations and for application to international transportation.As a result of extensive revision in 1963 and 1964, and further effortin 1966, a version of the IAEA ``Regulations for Safe Transport of RadioactiveMaterials, Safety Series No. 6'' was published in 1967. The IAEA regulationshave since been adopted generally by most nations of the world as a basisfor their own national regulations governing the transportation of radioactivematerials.Since 1966, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) (formerly theAtomic Energy Commission (AEC)) has issued regulations which are substantiallyin conformance with IAEA standards for fissile radioactive materials andlarge quantities of radioactive materials. In October 1968 the HazardousMaterials Regulation Board of DOT published amendments which were alsoin substantial conformance with the 1967 IAEA standards (Docket HM-2, 33FR 14918).In February 1969, recognizing that the international standards should berevised from time to time on the basis of scientific and technical advances,as well as accumulated experience in their application, the IAEA invitedits member states to submit comments and suggested changes to the regulations.Other goals of this IAEA procedure were to remove any ambiguities and tosimplify the presentation of the text of the regulations.Within the U.S., comments and suggested revisions to the IAEA regulationswere collected by DOT from the AEC, the American National Standards Institute(ANSI), the Atomic Industrial Forum and others. As a result of that effort,a compilation of approximately 40 comments was forwarded by DOT to theIAEA in July 1969. Some of those suggested changes were intended to moreclosely align U.S. regulations with the IAEA regulations.In 1970 the IAEA convened a panel of experts to review the regulationsand consider the comments which had been submitted by member states. Asa result of this review panel's efforts and additional revisions, the DirectorGeneral of the IAEA (Director General) transmitted a third revision draftto all IAEA member states and to interested international organizations.In January 1971, the Office of Hazardous Materials of the DOT publisheda public notice (36 FR 1280) in the form of a ``Request for Public Adviceon Revisions of International Regulations.'' Interested persons therebywere informed of the issuance and availability of this third revised draft,identified as IAEA Document No. PL-383, entitled ``Regulations for theSafe Transport of Radioactive Materials, Third Revised Draft, November1970''.In cooperation with the AEC, the DOT solicited comments on this third draft.Copies were distributed to all AEC operating contractors, as well as theAtomic Industrial Forum and ANSI Subcommittee N14 (Transportation of Fissileand Radioactive Materials) for redistribution to their members and otherinterested persons. Formal U.S. comments on the third draft were forwardedby DOT to the IAEA through the Department of State. A final Review Panel of experts was convened by the IAEA in October 1971,to finalize the revisions. As a result of that Panel, the IAEA subsequentlyissued its ``Safety Series No. 6, Regulations for the Safe Transport ofRadioactive Materials 1973 Revised Edition,'' in late 1973. Subsequentto the issuance of the 1973 Edition of IAEA Safety Series No. 6, the IAEAconvened another Review Panel in December 1974. The purpose of this Panelwas to consider any minor inconsistencies, omissions or errors that wererevealed in the course of national and international applications to theIAEA's 1973 Revised Standards, and to recommend, among other things, anychanges in details that should be made in the regulations under the establishedprocedures of the IAEA Board of Governors. As a result of the 1974 Review Panel work, the IAEA developed a list ofminor drafting changes to the 1973 Revised Edition of Safety Series No.6, which became effective in May 1975, as well as a list of substantiveproposed changes under the ``90-day'' amendment procedure. These latterchanges were adopted in 1977 by the IAEA. At its first meeting in October 1978, IAEA's Standing Advisory Group forthe Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials (SAGSTRAM), established bythe Director General in October 1977, reviewed and recommended a smallnumber of additional amendments, some of which slightly modified the changesissued by the IAEA in 1977. The recommendations of SAGSTRAM were subsequentlypublished by the Director General as the ``1973 Revised Edition, As Amended.''On March 10, 1983, RSPA published Docket HM-169 (48 FR 10218), which revisedthe HMR relating to the transportation of radioactive materials. That revision,in combination with a parallel revision of 10 CFR part 71 administeredby the USNRC, brought United States domestic transport safety regulationsat the Federal level in accord with relevant portions of the IAEA designand performance requirements to the extent considered feasible. This actionmade U.S. regulations compatible with the domestic regulations of mostof the international community. At the time of the 1971 Review Panel, a decision was made that periodicreview of Safety Series No. 6 should be carried out at intervals of about10 years to assure that the requirements were kept current. As a result,a review was initiated in 1979 to fulfill this commitment for periodicevaluation. As in the past, the IAEA solicited comments and proposals for changes frommember states and international organizations. Based on more than 200 pagesof comments, the IAEA convened a Review Panel for the comprehensive reviewof Safety Series No. 6 considering changes in transport conditions andmethods used for shipping radioactive materials. The Review Panel was againcomposed of the major countries involved in radioactive material transportation.The Review Panel was asked to strike a balance between keeping the regulationsreasonably the same for continuity and ease of application and making necessarychangs as a result of experience gained in their application. Two additionalpanel meetings produced a draft document that was issued in 1985 by theIAEA as the ``1985 Edition'' of Safety Series No. 6. Minor changes to the1985 edition were made in 1986. Docket HM-169 was written to incorporate,to the extent possible, some of the changes anticipated in the 1985 versionof Safety Series No. 6. At its Fifth Meeting in 1986 SAGSTRAM recommended that Safety Series No.6 undergo revision every ten years for major changes, and that minor changesand changes of detail be made at two-year intervals to ensure that it remainscurrent with technology and needs. Minor changes are promulgated by theDirector General without specific member state acceptance; changes of detailare subject to the ``90 day'' rule in which members states are given theopportunity to submit their acceptance or rejection of individual changesof detail. These recommendations were accepted by the Director General.To initiate the revision process, the IAEA in 1986 again solicited commentsand proposals for changes to the regulations and to its supporting documents.A Technical Committee was convened in 1987 to review the member state submittals,to determine which submittals warranted consideration and to assign eachsubmittal to the appropriate category of change. Given the recommendationsof this Technical Committee, the Director General promulgated the minorchanges and submitted the changes of detail under the ``90 day'' rule.The changes were accepted by the member states and were published as ``Supplement1988'' to the 1985 edition of Safety Series No. 6. This notice proposes to revise the HMR, as it relates to the transportationof radioactive materials, so that it is in essential conformance with the1985 edition of Safety Series No. 6 and the Supplement 1988. These revisionsto the HMR are necessary to allow for the international transportationof radioactive materials to and from the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Changes </ITAG>While this notice proposes an extensive revision of that portion of theregulations dealing with the transportation of radioactive materials, themajority of the changes are not substantive in nature. Many changes involverevision of section and paragraph numbers and their references and theuse of the International System of Units (SI units) for radiological measurementswhere appropriate. In addition, a few sections are proposed to be rewrittento provide clarity without changing their subject matter. Although notall of subpart I of part 173 of 49 CFR, entitled ``Radioactive Materials'',has been proposed to be changed, it has been reprinted in its entiretyfor ease of understanding. Substantive changes are discussed in the followingparagraphs. Radiation Protection On January 27, 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publisheda document titled, ``Radiation Protection Guidance to Federal Agenciesfor Occupational Exposure: Recommendations Approved by the President.''This document updated radiation guidance to Federal agencies. The recommendationsare provided to Federal agencies to enable them to revise or develop detailedstandards and regulations in those areas for which they have regulatoryor administrative jurisdiction. As the lead Federal agency in this area,the EPA will monitor Federal agency compliance with the recommendations,will provide clarification and interpretation, as appropriate, to reflectnew information, and will promote the necessary coordination to achievean effective Federal program of worker protection. Among its recommendations, the EPA specifies that no exposure should occurunless an overall benefit will be derived from the activity causing theexposure; that radiation dose should be maintained as low as it is reasonablyachievable (ALARA); that the annual effective dose equivalent be limitedto 50 milliSieverts (5 rems) to the whole body, 150 milliSieverts (15 rems)to lens of the eye, and 500 milliSieverts (50 rems) to any other organ,tissue or extremity of the body; that occupation exposure for individualsunder the age of 18 not exceed \1/10\ of values recommended for radiationworkers; and that the dose equivalent to an unborn child as a result ofthe occupational exposure of a woman who has declared herself to be pregnantshould not exceed 5 milliSieverts (500 millirems) during the entire gestationperiod. Since this proposal only summarizes EPA's recommendations, thefull text should be obtained from EPA for study. RSPA proposes to incorporate the EPA recommendations into the HMR. TheHMR would incorporate the EPA document by reference, would require thatan ALARA program be established, and would limit radiation exposures tothose specified in the EPA recommendations. The HMR would also providefor a three-tier approach for developing a radiation protection programto monitor the dose to any worker exposed to radiation for meeting therecommendations of the EPA guidance. For annual effective dose equivalentsnot exceeding 5 milliSieverts (500 millirems), a shipper or carrier wouldnot be required to provide any detailed monitoring program for the workers.However, the shipper or carrier would be responsible for periodically evaluatingoperations to ensure that no activity would cause an annual dose to exceed5 milliSieverts (500 millirems). For operations which will cause an annualdose of between 5 milliSieverts (500 millirems) and 15 milliSieverts (1.5rems), the shipper or carrier would be required to perform periodic assessmentsof radiation exposure levels for each worker in this range to determineif controls to limit exposure should be implemented or if constant personnelexposure monitoring is required. For operations which will cause an annualdose of between 15 milliSieverts (1.5 rems) and 50 milliSieverts (5 rems),a radiation exposure monitoring program for each individual would be implemented.Programs would be able to satisfy this latter requirement through the issuanceand monitoring of individual personnel exposure devices on a monthly orquarterly basis. The promulgation of a radiation protection program will bring the HMR inline with other Federal agencies which control the radiation exposure ofoccupationally exposed individuals. For example, under the Atomic EnergyAct of 1954, as amended, the USNRC limits the radiation exposure of individualswho are employed by its licensees. Similarly, the Department of Energyunder this same Act conducts a radiation protection program for its employeesmeeting the requirements of the Federal guidance. General Design Requirements for All PackagesAs proposed, certain packagings used for the transportation of radioactivematerials would be required to have greater integrity. Excepted packagesare currently required to meet the requirements only for a strong, tightpackage. Under the proposal, all packages of radioactive materials, includingexcepted packages, would be required to meet general design requirementsprescribed in andSection; 173.410. These packages would be required to bedesigned for ease of handling and proper restraint during shipment. Theywould be required to be free of protuberances and easily decontaminated.They would be required to be capable of withstanding the effects of vibrationduring transport. They also would be required to meet reduced pressureand temperature requirements. Minimum design requirements for exceptedpackages will increase the overall integrity of the packages. Low Specific Activity Material and Surface Contaminated ObjectsThe IAEA has been working to update its requirements for shipment of lowspecific activity material (LSA) to provide for the transportation of irradiatedand contaminated parts and equipment from decommissioned nuclear plants.The IAEA adopted a new designation for radioactive material called surfacecontaminated object (SCO). Unlike LSA, which requires a uniform distributionof radioactive material within the material, SCO is not inherently radioactivebut is superficially contaminated. Not every conceivable type of radioactivematerial that is removed from a facility during the decommissioning processwill be covered by this proposal. New materials can be added to the SCOdefinition as needed. RSPA and USNRC concur with the IAEA in recognizingthe need to issue regulations for the transportation of this specific typeof material. New LSA and SCO regulations consist of the following: 1. An expansion of the LSA definition to include new types of material;2. A new definition of ``surface contaminated object'' (SCO) which is treatedin a manner similar to LSA material; and 3. An increase of specific activity limits for nondispersible, nonrespirableforms of LSA material while at the same time limiting the quantity of LSAmaterial which can be shipped in other than a Type B package. The packagequantity limit is intended to limit external radiation levels producedas a result of shielding loss in a transportation accident. In the past, overlapping statutory authority between the USNRC and DOTfor regulating the transportation of radioactive material has created someconfusion about which agency had regulatory authority for packages containingLSA. To clarify regulatory authority in this area, the current proposalestablishes RSPA regulatory authority for packages containing LSA and SCOmaterials in amounts not exceeding 2 times the A<T2>1</T2> value (2A<T2>1</T2>) for the specific nuclide being transported. Above that levelthe USNRC will assume regulatory responsibility. Although the proposed regulations establish 2A<T2>1</T2> as the level of contained radioactive material above which theUSNRC regulations become applicable, the corresponding IAEA standard isexpressed as an external radiation level at 3 meters from the unshieldedmaterial or object of 10 milliSievert/hr (1 rem/hr). The value A<T2>1</T2> for any specified radionuclide is the quantity of that radionuclideas a point source which produces a radiation level of 10 milliSieverts/hr(1 rem/hr) at a distance of 3 meters. Considering that LSA and SCO materialsare bulk sources with considerable self-shielding, the value 2A<T2>1</T2> was chosen by RSPA and the USNRC as a close approximation ofthe IAEA standard of 10 milliSieverts/hr (1 rem/hr) at 3 meters. This approachwill make U.S. regulations inconsistent with those of IAEA, but littleimpact in international transportation should be experienced. A new type of package, called the ``industrial package'', is being proposedfor the handling of low specific activity material (LSA) and surface contaminatedobjects (SCO). Three categories of industrial packages (IP) IP-1, IP-2and IP-3 are being proposed; each would have to meet differing packagingrequirements. These packages would replace the modified Type A package,that is currently required for nonexclusive use shipments, and the strong,tight package, that is currently permitted for exclusive use shipments.For nonexclusive use shipments, the packaging requirements for LSA wouldnot be substantially changed. The proposed provision would allow a shipperto determine the acceptable industrial package as based on the type ofLSA or SCO to be shipped. In most cases, existing LSA packages could continueto be used. Certain lower hazard LSA and SCO could be shipped in a packageequivalent to an excepted package. For exclusive use shipments, the industrialpackage would be required to meet minimum design requirements that arecurrently required for all packaging except for excepted packages. However,based on the type of LSA or SCO to be shipped, the shipper would have someflexibility in the design of the package. This proposal is intended to produce an overall increase in the integrityof the packaging used for LSA and SCO. It will also ensure that industrialpackages produced in the U.S. can be used in international commerce witha minimum of delay in shipment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Expansion of Radionuclide List and Changes in Radionuclide Limits</ITAG>Based on numerous proposals for additions to the table of radionuclides,in which limits are listed for the quantity of radioactive material ina single package, IAEA concluded that its table needed to include all radionuclideswhich have the potential for transportation. As a result, the table inandSection; 173.435, which provides A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values, has been expanded from 284 entries to 378 entries. Becausethere now should be few instances where unlisted radionuclides would betransported, the rules for calculating values for unlisted radionuclideswould be simplified. The determination of limits for unlisted radionuclides,except for very conservative values, would be made subject to RSPA approval.The preamble to the 1983 revision of the HMR (48 FR 10218) noted that theIAEA had replaced its concept of transport groups with a system of A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values determining the package type needed to transport radioactivematerials. The A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values are the maximum quantities of a particular radionuclidepermitted in Type A packages in special form and normal form, respectively.Type A packages are those which provide adequate containment, shielding,and criticality control under normal conditions of transport and minoraccidents, but are not designed to survive severe transportation accidents.Accident-resistant packages are identified as Type B. Radioactive materialin special form is either a nondispersible solid or an encapsulated sourceto minimize the dispersibility and, therefore, the radiological hazardof the radioactive material. This system of limiting the radioactive contentof Type A packages to A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values depending on the dispersibility of the contents is theregulatory scheme for limiting the potential radiological hazard of a serioustransportation accident involving packages of radioactive material. The IAEA has since modified the system for determining A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values. Although this system is based on achieving essentiallythe same limitations on potential accident radiological hazards as itspredecessor system, the new system has the following advantages: 1. It states more clearly the radiation protection criteria employed;2. It incorporates the data and conclusions on metabolic pathways providedduring the years 1977-1981 by the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection (ICRP)3. It includes dosimetric routes through human organs not previously considered;and4. It harmonizes IAEA regulations with ICRP recommendations on radiologicalsafety in Publications ICRP26 and ICRP-30.The effect of IAEA's adoption of this new system for calculating A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values, and the subsequent incorporation of the new values inthe HMR, is that most current A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values would be amended. Of the 284 radionuclide entries insection 173.435, A<T2>2</T2> values would be raised in 129 cases and lowered in 95 cases.Of the A<T2>1</T2> values, 144 would be raised and 73 lowered.The new IAEA system for calculating A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values is described in Appendix I, ``The Q System for the Calculationof A and A Values,'' of IAEA Safety Series No. 7, ``Explanatory Materialfor the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material(1985 Edition).''Classification of Fissile MaterialAs a result of the evolution of the fissile material criteria, IAEA recognizedthat the current three fissile classes could be combined and simplifiedinto a single system. The effect of the simplification of the IAEA systemnow being proposed for U.S. regulations is:1. Elimination of the three fissile class designations;2. Establishment of a single set of criteria for all packages of fissilematerials;3. Use of the transport index as the primary control of accumulations ofpackages in transport under nearly all conditions.Review by SectionSection 172.203(d) would be revised to add references to SI units; Referencesto Fissile Class III would be replaced with ``Fissile Material, ControlledShipments''; and for LSA and SCO shipments appropriate group notationswould be required on shipping papers.Section 172.310 would be amended to require the trefoil symbol, as specifiedin Appendix B to part 172, to be marked on packages of radioactive material.Section 172.403 would be amended to add referenece to SI unit.Paragraph (c)(17) of Appendix B to part 172 would be amended to note sizerequirements for the trefoil symbol on package markings labels and placards.A new andSection; 173.402, ``SI units'', would be added to phase in the useof the International System of Units (SI) for radiological measurements;that is, levels currently expressed in the customary units of rems andcuries could be expressed in SI equivalents of Sieverts and Becquerelsor customary units. The proposed revisions to the HMR use SI units followedby the customary units in parentheses. In many cases the limits in customaryunits have been extended to 3 significant figures so they represent a functionalequivalent to the limits expressed in SI units. Limits on length, pressure,weight, and temperature are also expressed in SI units with functionallyequivalent values in customary units following in parentheses. The objectiveof this approach is to maintain consistency with international regulationswhile allowing U.S. shippers to use the units with which they are mostfamiliar. These changes would be made throughout the HMR.Section 173.403 ``Definitions'', would be amended as follows:_Contamination would be defined;_Fissile material would be defined as the listed radionuclides, and thedefinition would delete reference to andSection;173.455;_The definition of low-specific-activity (LSA) material would be extensivelychanged to correspond to that of IAEA. The one remaining significant differencewould be the addition of a provision in the HMR for transportation of contaminatedearth in a closed vehicle in unpackaged form. Extensive removal of contaminatedearth has been found necessary in decommissioning facilities in the UnitedStates;_A new definition for industrial packages (IP) providing for three classifications,IP-1, IP-2, and IP-3, to be used for the transport of LSA and SCO in quantitiesnot to exceed 2A<T2>1</T2>;_The grandfather clause for special form radioactive material encapsulationwould be updated; and_A new definition of Surface Contaminated Object (SCO) would be added tocorrespond to the parallel definition in IAEA regulations. SCO would betreated in the regulations similarly to LSA materials, with industrialpackaging required for most applications.A new andSection;173.404, ``U.S. Competent Authority'', wich specifies theaddress of the U.S. Competent Authority for the transport of radioactivematerials, would be added for ease of reference.A new andSection;173.405, ``General Radiation Protection Principles'', wouldbe added to implement a requirement for the establishment of radiationprotection programs as follows:_Radiation exposures of transport workers would be subject to the recommendationsspecified in EPA's ``Radiation Protection Guidance to Federal Agenciesfor Occupational Exposure'';_Radiation exposures would be maintained as low as is reasonably achievable(ALARA);_Transport workers who are exposed to radiation would have to be givenappropriate training concerning the hazards of radiation. On July 26, 1989,RSPA published in the Federal Register (54 FR 31144) an NPRM, entitled``Training for Hazardous Materials Transportation'', under Docket HM-126Fwhich proposed new training requirements for those persons involved inthe transportation of hazardous materials. If and when this proposal andHM-126F become final rules, RSPA will make the necessary editorial changesto assure regulatory consistency;_The annual effective dose equivalent of transport workers exposed to radiationwould be limited to 50 milliSieverts (5 rems), which additional limitsof 150 milliSieverts (15 rems) for exposure of the lens of the eye and500 milliSieverts (50 rems) for exposure of any other organ, tissue, orextremity of the body;_Effective dose equivalent to an unborn child would be restricted to 5milliSieverts (500 millirems); and_Radiation exposures would be subject to a graded approach for actionsto be used to control radiation. This approach would be determined by themagnitude and likelihood of exposure.Section 173.410, ``General design requirements'', would be amended as follows:_A package would have to be capable of withstanding the effects of acceleration,vibration or vibration resonance during transport;_The materials of the packaging and any components would have to be chemicallyand physically compatible;_All values through which the package contents could escape would haveto be protected; and_A package intended for air transport would have to be designed to withstandreduced temperature and pressure during transport;_A package would be required to have a minimum dimension of 10 cm. (4 inches).A new andSection;173.411, ``Additional design requirements for industrialpackages'', would be added to specify the requirements for IP-1, IP-2,and IP-3 packages. The IP-1 would have to meet the general design requirementsfor all packages designed for the transportation of radioactive material.An IP-2 would have to meet the requirements for an IP-1, as well as beingsubjected to free drop and compression tests specified for a Type A package.An IP-3 would have to meet the requirements for a Type A package for non-liquids.Section 173.412, ``Additional design requirements for Type A packages'',would be amended to permit all packages containing liquids to use a doublecontainment system. This would eliminate the current small package prohibitionof this practice as well as requiring that expansion of liquids duringtemperature changes considered during design. This section would also beamended to include a closure requirement on containment systems that areseparate unit of the packaging.A new andSection;173.414, ``Authorized industrial packages'', would be addedto permit the use of IM 101 and IM 102 portable tanks and freight containersas industrial packages.Section 173.415, ``Authorized Type A packages'', would be amended to eliminatethe reference to DOT Specification 55 packaging, which has not been authorizedsince July 1, 1985. This section would also be amended to permit the useof Type A packaging that also meets the requirements of the USNRC for fissilematerials packaging.Section 173.416, ``Authorized Type B packages'', would be amended to eliminatethe reference to the DOT Specification 55 packaging. This would also eliminatethe use of DOT Specification 55 packaging as an inner container for DOTSpecification 20WC and 21WC overpacks. Section 173.417, ``Authorized packaging_fissile materials'', would be amendedto eliminate references to different fissile classes and to remove a directreference to authorized packaging for 500 grams of Uranium 235 and 320grams of plutonium through a cross-reference to the USNRC regulations.In addition, andSection; 173.417(a)(8) and (b)(5) specify the authorizedpackagings for Type A and Type B, respectively, quantities of fissile radioactivematerial. Section 173.417(b)(5)(iii) limits the amount of uranium hexafluoridein a package to the amount specified in ``Table 6_Authorized QuantitiesOf Uranium Hexafluoride (UF<T2>6</T2>) As Fissile Class II'' (Table 6). In Table 6, however, onlyDOT specifications 20PF-1 and 20PF-2 are authorized to contain a Type Bquantity of uranium hexafluoride. Therefore, andSection; 173.417(b)(5) wouldbe revised to authorize only the DOT specifications 20PF-1 and 20PF-2 forthe transportation of Type B quantities of uranium hexafluoride. Section 173.421-1, ``Excepted packages for limited quantities of radioactivematerial'' would be amended to require compliance with the design requirementsof andSection; 173.410. Section 173.421-1, ``Additional requirements for excepted packages'', wouldbe amended to incorporate new proper shipping names and new UN identificationnumbers for excepted packages. Section 173.422, ``Excepted packages for instruments and articles,'' wouldbe amended to require that the instrument or article be marked with theword ``radioactive''.  Section 173.423, ``Table of activity limits_excepted quantities and articles'',would be amended to remove the direct reference to tritiated water. Section 173.425, ``Transport requirements for low specific activity material(LSA) and surface contaminated objects (SCO)'', would be amended to limitthe activity in any LSA or SCO package to 2A<T2>1</T2>, and to specify the appropriate industrial package for LSA andSCO transport in a new Table 8, ``Industrial package integrity requirementsfor LSA material and SCO.'' Section 173.433, ``Requirements for determination of A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values for radionuclides'', would be completely amended to incorporatea less complex method for calculating the A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values. Section 173.435, ``Table for A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values for radionuclides'', would be amended to incorporatenew A values as specified in the IAEA regulations. Section 173.447, ``Storage incident to transportation_general requirements'',would be amended to delete references to fissile classes. Section 173.448, ``General transportation requirements'', would be amendedto delete references to fissile classes. Section 173.453, ``Fissile materials_exceptions'', would be amended bydeleting the exception for thermal reactor irradiated uranium and for thoriumor uranium with not more than 0.72% fissile material. Section 173.455, ``Classification of fissile materials packages'', wouldbe deleted entirely because of the elimination of fissile classes. Section 173.457, ``Transportation of fissile material, controlled shipment-requirements'',would redefine fissile class III shipments in terms of a new fissile material,controlled shipment.

Additionally, a new subparagraphspecifying the contents of an application for shipment approval under specialarrangement would be addressed. Section 173.478, ``Notification to competent authorities for export shipments'',would be amended to delete references to fissile classes and would requireadditional information to be submitted to other national competent authoritiesfor special arrangement shipments. Specifically, a notification of a specialarrangement shipment will be required to include the name of the radionuclide,a description of the physical and chemical form, and the activity of thematerial. In the modal requirements, parts 174 through 177, those sections involvingradioactive material transportation would be updated to reflect the proposedchanges in parts 171 through 173. Some of these proposed changes includethe addition of metric and SI units and changes in regulatory references.In addition, those proposed changes to part 177, entitled ``Carriage byPublic Highway'', will also be incorporated into a future rulemaking beingdeveloped by RSPA which will propose to recodify part 177. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Administrative Notices </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 The RSPA has determined that this proposed rule (1) is not ``major'' underExecutive Order 12291; (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT's regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034); (3) will not affect not-for-profitenterprises or small governmental jurisdictions; and (4) does not requirean environmental impact statement under the National Environmental PolicyAct (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>). A preliminary regulatory evaluation is available forreview in the Docket. B. Executive Order 12612 This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that theproposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. C. Impact on Small Entities Based on limited information concerning size and nature of entities likelyto be affected, I certify that the proposed regulation will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities undercriteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Each group of packages must be handled and stowed not closer than 6meters (20 feet) (measured edge to edge) to any other group.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><ITAG tagnum="1">None <D>0.0 (0) </D><D>0.0 (0) </D><D>0.0 (0) </D><D>0.0 (0) </D><D>0.0 (0) </D><D>0.0 (0)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">0.1 to 1.0 <D>0.3 (1) </D><D>0.6 (2) </D><D>0.9 (3) </D><D>1.2 (4) </D><D>1.5 (5) </D><D>0.3 (1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1.1 to 5.0 <D>0.9 (3) </D><D>1.2 (4) </D><D>1.8 (6) </D><D>2.4 (8) </D><D>3.4 (11) </D><D>0.6 (2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5.1 to 10.0 <D>1.2 (4) </D><D>1.8 (6) </D><D>2.7 (9) </D><D>3.4 (11) </D><D>4.6 (15) </D><D>0.9 (3)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10.1 to 20.0 <D>1.5 (5) </D><D>2.4 (8) </D><D>3.7 (12) </D><D>4.9 (16) </D><D>6.7 (22) </D><D>1.2 (4)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20.1 to 30.0 <D>2.1 (7) </D><D>3.0 (10) </D><D>4.6 (15) </D><D>6.1 (20) </D><D>8.8 (29) </D><D>1.5 (5)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30.1 to 40.0 <D>2.4 (8) </D><D>3.4 (11) </D><D>5.2 (17) </D><D>6.7 (22) </D><D>10.1 (33) </D><D>1.8 (6)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40.1 to 50.0 <D>2.7 (9) </D><D>3.7 (12) </D><D>5.8 (19) </D><D>7.3 (24) </D><D>11.0 (36) </D><D>2.1 (7)</D><F>Note 1: The distance in the table must be measured from the nearestpoint on the nearest packages of radioactive materials.</F></ITAG></ITAG>(c) Shipments of low specific activity materials and surface contaminatedobjects, as defined in andSection; 173.403 of this subchapter, must be loadedso as to avoid spillage and scattering of loose materials. Loading restrictionsare set forth in andSection; 173.425 of this subchapter.(d) Packages must be so blocked and braced that they cannot change positionduring conditions normally incident to transportation.(e) Persons should not remain unnecessarily in a vehicle containing radioactivematerials.(f) Each fissile material, controlled shipment (as defined in andSection;173.403 of this subchapter) must be transported in accordance with oneof the methods prescribed in andSection; 173.457 of this subchapter. Thetransport controls must be adequate to assure that no fissile material,controlled shipment is transported in the same transport vehicle with anyother fissile radioactive material shipment. In loading and storage areaseach fissile material, controlled shipment must be segregated by a distanceof at least 6 meters (20 feet) from any other package required to bearone of the ``Radioactive'' labels described in andSection; 172.403 of thissubchapter.(g) For shipments transported under exclusive use conditions the radiationdose rate must not exceed 0.02 mSv per hour (2 mrem per hour) in any positionnormally occupied in the motor vehicle. For shipments transported as exclusiveuse under the provisions of andSection; 173.441(b) for packages with externalradiation levels in excess of 2 mSv (200 mrem per hour) at the packagesurface, the motor vehicle must meet the requirements of a closed transportvehicle (andSection; 173.403 of this subchapter). The total transport indexfor packages containing fissile material may not exceed 100.31.

A vehicle may not be returned to service until the radiationdose rate at every accessible surface is 0.005 mSv per hour (0.5 mrem perhour) or less and the removable (non-fixed) radioactive surface contaminationis not greater than the level prescribed in andSection; 173.443(a).(b) This section does not apply to any vehicle used solely for transportingradioactive material if a survey of the interior surface shows that theradiation dose rate does not exceed 0.1 mSv per hour (10 mrem per hour)at the interior surface or 0.02 mSv per hour (2 mrem per hour) at 1 meter(3.3 feet) from any interior surface. These vehicles must be stenciledwith the words ``For Radioactive Materials Use Only'' in lettering at least0.076 meter (3 inches) high in a conspicuous place, on both sides of theexterior of the vehicle. These vehicles must be kept closed at all timesother than loading and unloading.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>32.
