Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. announced Wednesday that employeesand partnerships formed by employees will no longer be permitted topurchase new issues of bonds underwritten by the firm.   The investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee, in hearings last week, released documents showing Drexelemployees reaped huge profits by purchasing bonds underwritten bythe firm and then quickly reselling them, in one case within 17days.   Employees were permitted to buy bonds during initial offeringsof much-sought issues, even when the practice denied bonds topublic customers, the documents showed.   Drexel was instrumental in developing the market for thehigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds, which allow companies without atrack record of earnings to obtain financing based on whether theyhave sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. Junk bonds havebeen frequently used in corporate raiding.   Of the $32 billion in junk bonds issued in 1986, 40 percent wereunderwritten by Drexel, according to a congressional report.   Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph, in a letter to Rep.John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the committee andsubcommittee, stuck by his assertions that the employee purchaseswere proper, but said the firm was worried about appearances.   ``I indicated we supported such purchases; nonetheless publicperception is important to financial institutions such as ours andwe recognize that even the best of motives can be misunderstood,''he said.   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the subcommittee, saidDrexel's letter leaves a number of questions unanswered, includingwhether Drexel will be able to trade for its own accounts and passprofits on to employees in the form of bonuses.   He said he would also like to know if employee accounts will beable to trade in the secondary market, which is heavily influencedby the underwriting firm.   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for Drexel, said the firm had nocomment beyond its brief announcement.   Dingell, in a statement released by an aide, called Drexel'sdecision ``a very good step,'' adding, ``It should lay to restquestions associated with the fairness and legality of thatparticular practice.''   However, the aide, Dennis Fitzgibbons, said Dingell has made nodecision regarding his committee's ongoing investigation of Drexel.   Dingell has been criticized by Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., forsubpoenaing Michael Milken, chief of Drexel's junk bond unit, toappear before the committee even though Milken had indicated inadvance he would refuse to testify based on his constitutionalprotection from self-incrimination.   When he refused to testify, Milken confirmed he is underinvestigation by a federal grand jury in New York, which isreported to be looking into insider trading allegations.   Dingell said the firm's retreat on employee purchases``indicates that the behavior of the committee was correct and fairin bringing these matters to light.''   Junk bonds pay higher interest rates than those issued byestablished companies and are considered riskier investments. Theyhave been used by corporate raiders to finance unfriendly takeoverattempts.</TEXT></DOC>
