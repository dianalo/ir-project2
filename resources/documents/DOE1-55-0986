Uniquedata on the aerosol formation in the photooxidation of toluene, m-xylene,ethyl benzene and 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene were obtained. These data illustratethe aerosol-forming potential of each aromatic compound when irradiatedboth in the absence and presence of pre-existing particles. A theoreticalframework to calculate the aerosol yield from an organic photo-oxidationwas developed. Data on nucleation suppression were obtained. Simulationsof the aerosol behavior in these systems were carried out using a simpleintegral aerosol model. These simulations generally agreed with experimentalobservations, with the exception of several experiments with initialparticles in the toluene system exhibiting nucleation when simulationsdid not predict this behavior. The question still remains to be resolved.</TEXT></DOC>
