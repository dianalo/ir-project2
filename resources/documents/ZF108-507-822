Rowe.andM;Using Gescan, articles can be routed automatically to users via electronicdistribution lists so users can receive relevant articles via electronicmail.andM;Gescan's connection to DowVision differs from Verity's Topic in that Gescanalso offers a stand-alone, hardware-based option, as opposed to Verity'sclient/server software.andP;  In addition, Topic, unlike Gescan, offers gatewaysto relational databases such as Oracle and Sybase, according to Bob Williams,Verity's vice president of marketing.andP;  This enables users to integrateincoming documents with existing databases, he added.andP;  Topic uses anon-Boolean, concept-retrieval method to search and filter information,Williams said.andM;The Gescan DowVision system is available now, priced from $12,000 to $55,000.andO;Prices for a stand-alone system start at $75,000.andM;For additional information, Gescan International Inc. can be contacted atP.O.
