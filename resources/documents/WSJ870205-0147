The oil and gas exploration and production company declined to name the prospective buyer, but said the party had made the best offer of a number of bidders for the properties. The company declined to elaborate on the offers, but said it hopes to complete negotiations for the sale this month.    The unit holds about 13 million barrels of proved oil reserves and 65 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves, which comprise substantially all of Texas International's domestic reserves.    Texas International earlier had sought a buyer for the entire unit, but said it failed to receive an acceptable offer. At that time, the company said it still would seek to sell the unit's reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
