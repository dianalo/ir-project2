Kay Orr said Tuesday night theRepublicans ``took on the tough issues and didn't flinch'' in theirplatform, and she urged skeptics to compare the GOP and Democraticplatforms side-by-side.   Orr, the platform chairwoman, told Republican delegates the40,000-word document they approved earlier in the day was ``far,far superior to the platform the Democrats cobbled together inAtlanta.''   ``The difference is simple: Republicans share their vision withthe American people. Democrats hide from the people,'' Mrs. Orrsaid.   ``The Democrats wanted to hide their views from the Americanpeople, because they knew that if the people ever found out whatthey really believed, they would lose,'' she said. ``They don'twant the people to know that they are still the party that willraise taxes and weaken our defense.''   Holding up a side-by-side comparison of the platforms preparedby her party, she urged the delegates and television viewers towrite the Republican National Committee in Washington to ask for acopy, ``or you can write your local newspaper and ask them to printit.''   Earlier, Orr told reporters the Republicans don't yet know howmuch it would cost to implement all the proposals in the GOPplatform, but they are working on an estimate. Orr has claimed theDemocrats' platform would cost taxpayers $43 billion next yearalone.   The first-term Nebraska chief executive said, ``We took on thetough issues and didn't flinch.''   ``Our platform presents a vision of America that is optimistic,bold and daring. ... The Democrats missed their chance to levelwith the American people. We didn't,'' she said.   She recalled George Bush's recent slap at Michael Dukakis as``the stealth candidate'' and said, ``the Democrats' platformproves it.''   ``You won't find some very basic words in the Democraticplatform _ words like `tax' or `revenue' or `unemployment.' Youwon't find any mention of NATO. You won't find the words `church'or `synagogue,''' she said.   ``We say loud and clear what Vice President Bush has said somany times: we won't raise taxes, period,'' she said.   She singled out planks in the GOP platform favoring a child caretax credit, college savings bonds, an end to ocean dumping andmandatory sentences for drug dealers.   ``On issue after issue, the contrast is clear: Democrats saynothing, or else they cloak their views in empty rhetoric. ButRepublicans tell the American people exactly what we stand for andexactly where we will lead this country,'' she said.   Orr ended her speech by saying that despite the ``tough andpainful times'' farmers have endured recently, ``Republicans areoptimistic about the future of American agriculture.''   She said the party rejects ``the Democrats' idea of mandatoryproduction controls,'' but wants to open markets abroad and ``findnew uses for farm products.''   ``As governor of a farm state, I know that the future ofAmerican farming will be secure with George Bush as president,''she said. ``Michael Dukakis knows so little about agriculture thathe told the farmers of Iowa that they ought to try growing Belgianendive.''</TEXT></DOC>
