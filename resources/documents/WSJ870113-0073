Leading off a series of Senate hearings on defense strategy, Mr. Weinberger made it clear that the administration plans to build up its nuclear forces, as well as develop space-based weapons to intercept and destroy enemy missiles. &quot;Effective strategic defense would bolster, not replace, deterrence, (and) provide protection should deterrence ever fail,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as our adversaries possess nuclear weapons, we must continue to maintain modern, effective nuclear forces.&quot;    The secretary's comments came amid continuing confusion about how Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, would fit into the administration's overall strategy. Earlier administration statements suggested that space-based defenses would replace current strategy, which seeks to maintain the threat of massive retaliation in order to prevent an adversary from launching a nuclear attack against the U.S.    For example, in March 1985, President Reagan said, &quot;We seek to render obsolete the balance of terror -- or mutual assured destruction -- and replace it with a system incapable of initiating armed conflict or causing mass destruction, yet effective in preventing war.&quot;    In the Iceland summit last fall, Mr. Reagan proposed eliminating ballistic missiles, and then deploying Star Wars weapons. Those talks collapsed, however, and since the meeting, many U.S. officials have backed away from the president's far-reaching proposal.    Some administration officials, as part of their early justification for the Star Wars effort, called the current nuclear policy of threatened nuclear retaliation immoral. Following Secretary Weinberger's clarification of the administration's strategy, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) commented, &quot;We're still going to be dependent for some time on what has been labeled an immoral and flawed approach.&quot;    The defense secretary's comments will assure some European allies, who worry that if the U.S. abandons its current nuclear strategy, Europe will be left vulnerable to superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.    Meanwhile, Mr. Weinberger has indicated that he may be open to early deployment of certain space weapons. Originally, the Reagan administration suggested the decision whether to deploy Star Wars should be made in the mid-1990s -- after policy-makers could determine whether such weapons could protect entire populations from attack.    But Sunday, Secretary Weinberger said on ABC News that he &quot;would be delighted to deploy just as soon as we can&quot; a portion of the system that &quot;we might call Phase One of the Strategic Defense Initiative.&quot;    Pressure to begin deploying antimissile systems is mounting among conservative supporters of the Star Wars program. Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.), also speaking Sunday on ABC News, said, &quot;the patience of the Congress is running out. . . . I think we ought to look at deploying SDI.&quot;    In his Senate testimony yesterday, Secretary Weinberger clarified some other aspects of the Reagan administration's strategy. He soft-pedaled indications that the U.S. would widen a U.S.-Soviet conflict by attacking Russian military assets in a second region if war broke out.    Navy officials have argued strenuously for a policy of launching attacks in the Pacific if the Soviets ever started a war in Europe. But Mr. Weinberger said that such a strategy might prove dangerous. &quot;Since the Soviet Union possesses war-widening options at least as effective as those of the U.S., and particularly since geographic and nuclear escalatory considerations may be linked, U.S. interests demand careful attention to the potential benefits and risks of escalation,&quot; he told the committee. </TEXT></DOC>
