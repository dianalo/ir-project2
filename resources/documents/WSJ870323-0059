Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MERSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. court extended an order freezing the assets of an Israeli financier and a former Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. executive charged with a $4 million insider-trading scheme. But the SEC said the financier, David Sofer, has indicated he will fight the SEC over control of his overseas assets.    The SEC also disclosed in a memorandum filed at a court hearing Friday that its charges against Mr. Sofer and Nahum Vaskevitch, the former Merrill official, were filed March 11 in an &quot;emergency&quot; atmosphere because the SEC believed that Mr. Sofer was trying to move some of his allegedly illicit profits out of the U.S. to Switzerland.    The statement that Mr. Sofer may fight the SEC overseas, also made at the hearing, marked the first indication of any response in the case from Mr. Sofer or Mr. Vaskevitch, Merrill Lynch's former head of mergers in London. Both have been unreachable for comment and their lawyers have declined to discuss the case.    The SEC alleged that Mr. Sofer and Mr. Vaskevitch reaped more than $4 million from insider trading over the past three years, based on tips from Mr. Vaskevitch about deals involving Merrill Lynch clients.    The SEC memorandum alleged that Mr. Sofer unsuccessfully tried to transfer to Switzerland about $500,000 from a brokerage account in which he allegedly made insider trades. Earlier this year, Mr. Sofer transferred about $1.9 million from the brokerage account to a Swiss Bank, the SEC charged.    Thomas C. Newkirk, an SEC lawyer, said Mr. Sofer's lawyer in New York has indicated that Mr. Sofer plans to fight for control of his assets overseas, where the U.S. court's freeze order might not be enforceable. Mr. Sofer hasn't decided whether to contest the U.S. court over his U.S. assets, Mr. Newkirk said. The SEC has declined to disclose the amount of Mr. Sofer's and Mr. Vaskevitch's assets.    Mr. Sofer's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, declined to comment.    The SEC is seeking penalties in the insider trading case of as much as three times the alleged illicit profit, or a maximum penalty of more than $12 million. If the defendants' assets in the U.S. are not sufficient, the stage could be set for a fight to seize assets in foreign countries such as Switzerland.    Friday's 10-day extension of the asset freeze was made by Judge Robert W. Sweet. Judge Sweet said the extension would give him time to review the SEC's request for a longer-term preliminary injunction against Mr. Vaskevitch and Mr. Sofer. </TEXT></DOC>
