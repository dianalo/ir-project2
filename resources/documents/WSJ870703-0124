KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A government-commissioned study warned that the U.S. needs to give much more attention to lagging productivity and work skills in the economy's rapidly growing service segments.    The report by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based research group, said the nation's emphasis on shoring up manufacturing productivity, in response to increasing competition in world trade, has obscured major efficiency problems in the service sector, which already makes up 70% of the economy.    Declining productivity in health care and other service industries needs to be reversed and employers must find ways to overcome some inflexibility in older workers, who will comprise a larger share of the work force, the authors said. The nation also has to close an increasing gap between the level of skills new jobs require and the lack of education and training among minority and other persons who are the bulk of new worker prospects, the study concluded.    It suggested consideration of changes in tax laws, unemployment insurance and public education, and more investment in child care, among other ways to solve these problems.    Labor Secretary William Brock, whose department commissioned the study, yesterday created a new Work Force 2000 project office that will try to help achieve the goals of the report. He said the office will work with other Labor agencies, and with labor, industry, government and academic officials in promoting efforts to widen worker skills, increase their flexibility and otherwise improve the work force. Such efforts might include new basic education programs, revamped worker-training projects or new family-care services that could boost productivity of women workers, department officials said.    &quot;If we don't change our ways, we are going to see a greater disparity between the employed and the unemployable,&quot; producing the kind of &quot;class society&quot; that the nation has always tried to avoid, Secretary Brock said.    The study, also called Work Force 2000, was sponsored by the department, and projects major changes in the economy and its employment structure in the next 13 years. While the U.S. will continue to strengthen its manufacturing muscle, the study said, &quot;service industries will create all of the new jobs and most of the new wealth&quot; over the rest of this century.    The report underscored what has become Mr. Brock's major mission -- advocating better education and other steps that could overcome illiteracy and other problems keeping minority youth, many women, disabled persons and others from efficiently filling the new, service-sector jobs. The secretary's &quot;discomfort with the status quo is rapidly becoming legendary,&quot; said his assistant secretary, Roger Semerad.    The $127 billion public educational system must be altered to serve minority youth better, the Hudson Institute report said. &quot;Radical changes&quot; such as turning some schools over to private management and applying performance standards to teachers, students, administrators and schools themselves may be in order, it said.    More investment in child care, pregnancy prevention, welfare reform, &quot;big brother&quot; programs and similar efforts seem appropriate, the study said.    But the study also focused on some other, perhaps less-publicized trends, such as lagging service-industry productivity and the increasing role of aging persons in the work force. Health care, education and other services have escaped the kind of competition from abroad that lately has helped boost U.S. manufacturing productivity, the report said.    The report pointed to some signs that U.S. service-sector productivity may start rising, including investment in health-care diagnostic technology and newly developed computer software for imparting math, reading and science know-how in schools. But the report said considerably more such advances are necessary.    By concentrating the productivity debate on manufacturing competition with Japan, &quot;we are focusing on the wrong industries and the wrong country,&quot; William Johnston, project director for the study, said.    More attention also should be directed toward the nature of the work force itself, which &quot;will grow slowly, becoming older, more female, and more disadvantaged,&quot; the study said. Only 15% of those entering the labor pool by the year 2000 will be American-born white males, compared with 47% today, it said.    &quot;As the average age of American workers climbs toward 40, the nation must insure that its work force does not lose its adaptability and willingness to learn,&quot; the report said. While older workers have greater experience, they're less willing to move, change jobs or be retrained, Mr. Johnston said.    Tax laws, unemployment insurance and retraining programs should be reworked to encourage more switching of pensions from one employer to the next, more relocation, and broader retraining plans, the institute's study said. </TEXT></DOC>
