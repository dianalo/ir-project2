Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX FND </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Welcome to the world of closet arbitragers, a most unlikely class of takeover-stock speculators.    They run America's retirement money, mutual funds and college endowment pools -- big, conservative investors. Yet they are gradually creeping into the domain of Wall Street's fastest money.    Dazzled by the 40% to 60% returns that professional takeover-stock traders have reaped so far this year, the staid old institutions are dabbling ever more aggressively in shares of companies that get acquisition bids.    &quot;We're willing to borrow a leaf from {the arbs'} book,&quot; says Jim Severance, portfolio manager for the Wisconsin Investment Board, which runs the state's pension money.    Some investment managers wonder if the elephants of investing are lumbering into trouble. They think the institutions' increasing speculation means the takeover boom could be nearing a blowout. Institutions are often late in catching investment trends. If takeover stocks suddenly go bust, as they did in last year's crash, institutions could take huge losses.    Other people have a more immediate concern: Speculation by giant institutions might increase volatility in takeover and rumor stocks, exaggerating gains and worsening drops. This could further disillusion small investors, who have been bailing out of the market since the crash.    Institutions have long been passively involved in the takeover game, simply because their holdings are so broad that they own shares of many companies that become takeover targets. Big money managers used to take the money and run once a bid was announced. They would sell out, taking quick profits. The arbs would swoop in to buy the institutions' stock, willing to assume the risk that the deal might collapse in exchange for healthy short-term gains when the accord went through.    Now, however, the institutions have changed their behavior in two ways. They often cling to their holdings in announced takeovers or leveraged buy-outs, waiting for the second and even third offers that these days seem inevitable. More startling, some managers have started buying shares after a takeover bid is announced, looking for the sweetened bid that may or may not come.    &quot;We try to do just what the arbitragers do, and we do talk to people in the arbitrage community,&quot; says Bruce Calvert, research director at Alliance Capital Management, a huge mutual fund group. &quot;We now are more likely, once the deal has been announced, to see what all the possible angles are over the next month or two.&quot;    What's behind the change? You guessed it: money.    In contrast with the arbs, who have profited handsomely from the latest takeover wave, many portfolio managers have been hit by a double whammy. They have underperformed Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, the barometer by which many of them get paid. And money managers' fees have been pressured by competition from index funds, which match the holdings of the Sandamp;P or another index.    So managers are scrutinizing the arb plays to improve their returns. &quot;You can get yourself a pretty nice 12% return on many plays in three months or less&quot; if you hold a stock until the end, says one West Coast manager.    An arb at a major Wall Street firm cites pressure on managers. &quot;Given that the market is basically flat and this is the only game in town, money managers begin to commit,&quot; he says. &quot;These guys have to make money, and it's one of the few places to do it.&quot;    While many money managers say they never buy after the initial bid, Richard Strong, who heads Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management, is less conservative.    Mr. Strong owned only 27,000 shares of Kraft Inc. when Philip Morris Cos. announced its initial bid of $90 a share for the food company. Mr. Strong purchased aggressively: &quot;We bought some the day it was announced, and bought some every day after,&quot; he says. &quot;It's all based on value and having studied these companies. We literally have spent tens of thousands of hours&quot; following food stocks.    But even as they play the takeover game, money managers recognize the perils. &quot;There's certainly more risk now,&quot; Mr. Severance says. &quot;People are more prone to flee when there's bad news. They know there isn't sufficient underlying fundamental support for the stocks.&quot; On Black Monday, he notes, &quot;The market crashed but the arbitrage stocks imploded;&quot; if there were another market collapse, &quot;I have no doubt that would happen again.&quot;    Takeover stocks slumped briefly following Federated Department Stores' recent trouble with a junk bond issue and some cautionary comments about leveraged buy-out debt by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Nervous institutions started selling, the arbs stepped aside and stocks hit an air pocket.    &quot;It's still three points up and 40 points down in a lot of these deals,&quot; says a trader at one Wall Street partnership. Institutions &quot;become huge sellers with no buyers underneath them. There's no safety net.&quot;    Despite the risks, institutional managers often feel they can do a better job for clients by holding on to stocks rather than turning the shares over to arbs. &quot;Whatever percentage {of your holding} you gave them before in the opening round, you give them less now,&quot; says Ernest G. Wiggins Jr., who runs Fidelity's $150 million Value Fund. &quot;You sell some, because you'd feel foolish if the bid was pulled. Then you kind of wait around and see what happens.&quot;    The takeover frenzy has been fueled in part by Wall Street analysts, who are struggling to generate commissions in these low-volume times. &quot;Every stock is mentioned with a buy-out value,&quot; says Gerald Farber, who runs the partners fund at Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer, a New York investment firm. Many Wall Street firms create lists of takeover candidates.    A number of one-person and two-person &quot;valuation services&quot; have emerged to help institutional holders determine a company's breakup value and tell clients whether to hold or sell a stock in certain situations. For example, one institution recently asked a service to value CBS Inc. shares if the media giant sold a business and bought back stock.    The lure of a big payoff is inducing some managers to pay premium prices for stocks they like for fundamental reasons alone. &quot;I'll pay a 10% premium&quot; if a stock is a candidate for a 50% gain, Fidelity's Mr. Wiggins says. &quot;The deals are happening in industry groups that you'd feel comfortable with in troubled times anyway. How badly am I going to get damaged in American Brands?&quot;    With stock market volume lagging, &quot;Money managers are just desperate to perform,&quot; concludes one Wall Street trader. &quot;They'll do anything to try to improve their returns.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   A stronger than expected October employment report sent stock prices tumbling.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.54 points to close at 2145.80 in light trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 143.6 million shares. Declining issues far outpaced gainers, 993 to 472. For the week, the Dow Jones industrials were off 4.97 points.    The government reported that nonfarm payrolls grew 323,000, far above most estimates, while the unemployment rate declined to 5.3% from 5.4%. It had been expected to remain steady.    The strong job creation in October dashed hopes that the Federal Reserve might allow interest rates to fall. Treasury bonds plunged, setting the stage for the stock price drop.    Among blue-chip stocks, Aluminum Co. of America fell 1 1/2 to 54 1/4, Chevron lost 1 to 45, General Motors was off 1 1/4 to 83 3/8, McDonald's slipped 1 to 47, Philip Morris was down 1 to 95 1/4, Sears, Roebuck closed at 44 5/8, off 1 3/8, and Westinghouse Electric ended down 7/8 at 52 3/8. </TEXT></DOC>
