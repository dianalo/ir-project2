But Drexel chief executive Frederick H. Joseph, in 6{ hours oftestimony Thursday before the investigations subcommittee of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee, steadfastly defended thefirm's practice of permitting employees to form privatepartnerships to compete with other investors for bonds underwrittenby Drexel.   Under questioning from Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman ofboth the committee and subcommittee, Joseph acknowledged ``theperception of a conflict is troublesome.''   Still, he said Drexel not only condones the partnerships, butbelieves they benefit corporate bond issuers by making more moneyavailable to buy the bonds.   However, documents released by the subcommittee showed that onseveral occasions Drexel employees purchased bonds from much-soughtissues for their own accounts at the same time the firm's publiccustomers were being turned away.   In the case of Texstyrene Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz., manufacturerof styrofoam products, partnerships owned by Drexel employeespurchased $12 million of an initial $50 million offering inFebruary 1986, according to the subcommittee.   Public customers were allowed to buy only some of the bonds theywanted, and within 17 days Drexel employees made more than $900,000profits by selling the bonds back to Drexel, subcommittee documentsindicate.   In another case, the subcommittee said, Drexel employeespurchased $235 million of a $2.5 billion issue in the April 1986leveraged buyout of Beatrice Cos., a diversified food and consumerproducts company.   Again, other customers were denied the chance to purchase asmany bonds as they had initially ordered. And less than threemonths later, the employees made a $2.8 million profit by selling$61.4 million of the bonds, the subcommittee said.   ``Any way you slice it, the people on the outside aren't gettingthe same deal as the people on the inside,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden,D-Ore.   Rep. Dennis E. Eckart, D-Ohio, said Drexel, in effect, ``elbowedaside'' its own customers and ``cut to the head of the line.'' Hesaid a telephone survey of five top competitors of Drexel, whom hedeclined to identify, showed that none would permit similarpractices.   Joseph said it is quite common that investors will want to buymore bonds than are available and said Drexel used the samecriteria for deciding how many bonds employees could purchase as itdid for its other customers.   He said purchases by Drexel employees are closely monitored forpropriety by the firm's compliance department.   However, Rep. Norman Lent of New York, ranking Republican oncommittee, said the purchases for ``insider accounts'' appear toviolate the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commissionand the National Association of Securities Dealers.   Joseph argued that the rules applied only to sales of stockbecause bond prices are not subject to manipulation in the same wayas are prices of new stock issues.   Lent said high-quality, investment-grade bonds are exempt fromthe rules, but not the risky bonds of the type Drexel issued.   The subcommittee released a list of 35 so-called ``insideraccounts'' owned by employees including Michael Milken, chief ofDrexel's junk bond trading unit in Beverly Hills, Calif., andrelatives of Milken.   Also listed as having participated in the partnerships areDennis Levine, a former investment banker now serving a prison termfor securities law violations, and Martin Siegel, who also haspleaded guilty to violations of securities laws.   Both are former Drexel employees and have cooperated ingovernment probes of Wall Street corruption.   Milken, in a subcommittee appearance Wednesday, cited hisconstitutional protection against self-incrimination in refusing toanswer questions. He confirmed that he has been under investigationfor 18 months by a New York federal grand jury that is reported tobe probing insider trading.   Both Drexel and Milken have denied any wrongdoing.   Milken pioneered use of junk bonds to allow companies without atrack record of earnings to get financing based on whether they hadsufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. The bonds pay higherinterest rates than those of established companies and areconsidered riskier investments.</TEXT></DOC>
