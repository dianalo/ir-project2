<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0965 </DOCNO><TEXT>Integrity of shallow junction devices is dependent on maintaining smoothfilms of constant thickness where metal contacts doped silicon. Localizedsilicon oxide residue can enhance the WF/sub 6//Si reaction used in LPCVDtungsten depositions resulting in unacceptably large amounts of siliconconsumption. The authors investigated phenomena which cause excess WF/sub6//Si interaction that can lead to incursions of tungsten into siliconstructures. In layers between 1.0 nm and 2.0 nm thick, silicon oxideappears to catalyze the WF/sub 6//Si reaction and prevent or delay theself-limiting condition of LPCVD W film formation. Consequences for shallowjunction devices are discussed, and methods to avoid this problem arepresented.</TEXT></DOC>
