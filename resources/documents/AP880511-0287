No meeting has been canceled on such short notice on any of thepope's 36 previous foreign tours, and the incident raised newtensions between the Roman Catholic Church in Paraguay and thegovernment of President Alfredo Stroessner.   John Paul on Wednesday visited Cochabamba on Bolivia's desolatehigh plains, where he listened to the lament of jobless miners andpoverty-ravaged peasants and pledged the church's support.   The meeting next Tuesday was to be held in a government-ownedsports stadium in Paraguay's capital of Asuncion and was intendedto bring the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians.They were to include peasants, lawyers, religious leaders andmembers of opposition parties not recognized by the government.   The invitations to opposition leaders prompted governmentcriticism. Patria, the daily newspaper of Stroessner's rulingColorado Party, on Sunday described the meeting as a ``corruptassembly.''   Patria reported Tuesday that government officials, citing``security reasons,'' notified the pope's local envoy that themeeting had been canceled.   The Permanent Episcopal Council said it would search for anothersite.   John Paul is due to meet Stroessner soon after the pontiffarrives from Peru next Monday. The pope is on a 13-day tour of fourSouth American countries _ Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay.   The Vatican declined comment about the cancellation of themeeting. ``For the moment, I have nothing to say,'' said Vaticanspokesman Joaquin Navarro, traveling with the pope.   The government and Paraguay's bishops were at odds over theplanning of the pope's visit and there was little cooperationbetween them.   The church has criticized the government and its human rightsrecord. The Catholic radio station in Asuncion, Caritas, hasprovided air time to government opponents.   In the mining city of Oruro, Bolivia, Wednesday, an unemployedtin miner, Juan Alborte Cartagna, wailed as he addressed the popeon a stage, ``We are dying of hunger, Father. Help us ... We don'thave even a piece of bread.''   The miner, who has three children, placed a steel mining hat onthe pope's head as tears streamed down the miner's face. Thegesture drew cheers from an audience estimated by the church at160,000, many dressed in old or patched clothing.   Oruro, with an unemployment rate easily double the nationalaverage of 22 percent, is considered the center of misery inBolivia. The country is the poorest in South America.   Later, the pope said a Mass for more than 200,000 people afterreturning to Cochabamba.   In a meeting with priests and seminarians he praised foreignpriests working in Bolivia, saying: ``You are exercising yourministry with sacrifice and generosity in this, your adoptivecountry.''   A group of Bolivian bishops complained to the Vatican last monthabout the appointment of three foreign-born bishops. Of Bolivia's834 priests, 634 are foreigners.   Later, the pope urged 22,000 young people in a Cochabamba sportsstadium to avoid the temptations of drugs, sex and Marxism.   Cochabamba, a cocaine trafficking center in the country'sprincipal coca-growing region, called the Chapare, is plagued byincreasing drug use among the young.   Coca processing is outlawed in Bolivia, but the country's drugindustry supplies an estimated one-third of the cocaine thatarrives in the United States and Europe.   In Oruro, the pope was greeted by brass bands and groups ofdancers in multicolored sequined costumes and garishly paintedmasks with twisting horns.   Under blue skies, the pontiff addressed the crowd from a tallstage that provided a clear view of the state-run San Jose mine,from which most workers have been fired in a government austerityprogram.   ``I know of the many workers who have been displaced from theirjobs,'' John Paul said. ``The deep mines that years ago were thegreat source of national wealth ... are now only mute witnesses toso many lives silently consumed there.''   The Bolivian church has been criticized by the country'sconservative government for backing the social security demands ofjobless miners and peasants.   Because of a collapse in world tin prices, the government ofPresident Victor Paz Estenssoro shut down 14 of the 21 state-ownedmines, leaving 21,500 of 27,000 miners without jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
