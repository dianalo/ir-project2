Thursday reported earnings of nearly$200 million for the first quarter, reflecting the sale of twocable systems and an improvement from the previous year'sfirst-quarter loss.   The communications and entertainment company said the earningsof $199.1 million, or $3.73 a share, in the three months endedMarch 31 compared with a loss of $61.1 million a year earlier.   A pretax gain of $304.8 million on the sale of the Long Islandand Cleveland cable systems boosted earnings in the first quarter,Viacom said. Some of the $545 million of proceeds from the saleswere used to repay a portion of Viacom's bank debt.   First-quarter revenue amounted to $341.1 million, 16.4 percentabove the $293.1 million of revenue in the first three 1988 months.   Viacom, which owns the Showtime movie channel and other cableoperations, said MTV networks were strong in advertising sales andaffiliate fees.   Revenue and profit in the entertainment division benefitedsignificantly from the domestic syndication of the populartelevision program, The Cosby Show, the company said.   Viacom earlier this week filed suit against Time Inc. and Time'sHome Box Office and its other cable TV holdings. Viacom is seeking$2.4 billion in damages because it says Time is engaging in unfairpractices that are undermining competition in the pay-TV business.</TEXT></DOC>
