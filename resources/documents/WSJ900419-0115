Inthe seething, squalid camps of Gaza, Mr. Bocovza's smashwasn't seen as a careless accident, but an act of war; adeliberate killing of Palestinian laborers on their way homefrom work.</LP><TEXT>   Written by Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Ya'ari, two experiencedIsraeli military correspondents, the book offers much new andrevealing detail gleaned from army and security-serviceinsiders. For instance, a survey conducted in Gaza jailsduring the first days of the intifada showed that the riotswere being led by an entirely new type of protester,unfamiliar with even the most rudimentary slogans of thePalestine Liberation Organization or any of the typicalbaggage of politicized Palestinians.   Instead, the 100 or so young men interviewed turned out tobe driven to despair by the routine miseries of scramblingfor the poorly paid work unwanted by an Israeli majority whoregarded them with a mixture of contempt and fear. Many toldof humiliations, such as the wedding convoy stopped at acheckpoint, where the groom was ordered to dismantle thewheels and seats of his car as his anguished bride looked on.   Initially, such findings didn't stop Israeli politicianscalling the intifada the work of outside agitators, nor stopYasser Arafat pathetically trying to claim credit as itspuppet-master. Eventually though, the authors say, theevidence began &quot;tearing through the veil of hypocrisy andself-deceit that what Israel had practiced for over 21 yearswas a `benevolent occupation.'&quot;   Unfortunately, the book's insights are embedded inmechanical prose that clunks along with so many &quot;steamboilers,&quot; &quot;gaskets&quot; and &quot;pistons&quot; pressed into metaphoricalservice that it reads, in part, like a technical manual. Thisis a bloodless book, bereft of human voices. Instead ofallowing us to hear directly from the participants, Messrs.Schiff and Ya'ari distill the fruits of their extensivecontacts into a colorless concoction.   More serious is the book's lack of balance. The authorsdate their foreword October 1989, but the book seems to losetrack of the intifada long before that date. Little light isshed, for instance, on the uprising's sharp turn inward inthe second year: the ghastly murders of Palestinians by theirown activists on charges of collaboration with Israelis.   Perhaps this imbalance also skews the authors'conclusions. Arguing that the intifada has paved the way fora negotiated settlement, Israelis, they say, must askthemselves &quot;what life will be like in a country that ispreoccupied with suppressing a large part of the populationliving within its borders.&quot;   Yet the uprising has ceased to preoccupy Israel. Talkthese days turns excitedly to the influx of Soviet Jews, theneed for electoral reform, the nefarious intentions of Iraq'sSaddam Hussein. By avoiding West Bank roadways, forgoing theconvenience of shopping in cheaper Arab &quot;souqs&quot; and thepleasure of dining in the graceful stone precincts of ArabEast Jerusalem, most Israelis have reduced contact with theintifada to an uncomfortable awareness that part of militaryservice now includes a stint of riot control in the occupiedlands. And short of some visionary leadership on either theIsraeli or the Palestinian side, that isn't enough to compela settlement.   And many don't think it should. Like the government ofIsrael, the Washington D.C.-based authors Neil C. Livingstoneand David Halevy seem to have a policy of refusing to talk tothe PLO. Indeed, accuracy should require that their &quot;Insidethe PLO: Covert Wars, Secret Funds and the War Against Israeland the United States&quot; (William Morrow, 288 pages, $18.95) beretitled. &quot;Outside the PLO&quot; would be a good deal moreappropriate for a book that draws whatever marginal amount ofnew information it offers almost exclusively from unnamed&quot;intelligence officials&quot; -- mostly U.S. and Israeli.Otherwise the authors draw on newspaper articles andpublished works on terrorism.   The authors state that the book initially was envisionedas &quot;a modest monograph&quot; detailing PLO actions against theU.S., and that catalog of horrors remains its centerpiece.But in trying to deal with all the PLO's factions as well asits putative links with Abu Nidal and Hezbollah, the authorstoo often rest their case on cobwebs of thin research.   For example, the chapter on George Habash, leader of thePopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is titled&quot;Yesterday's Man.&quot; But recent conversations with Palestinians-- both inside the Israeli-occupied territories and ininfluential outside communities such as Kuwait's -- indicatethat the soft-spoken doctor, who feels armed struggle is thePalestinian's only long-term hope, is more likely than everto emerge as tomorrow's hero.   So far, Mr. Arafat's strategy strikes many of thedispossessed Palestinian young to have failed bitterly, andit is to an uneasy alliance of Dr. Habash's secular,left-wing faction and the Islamic extremists that more andmore eyes are turning.   ---   Ms. Brooks covers the Middle East for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
