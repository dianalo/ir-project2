The region is one of the most fiercely competitive for supermarket chains, which have seen their margins cut because of frequent, highly promoted price wars in recent years.    In a telephone interview, Roger E. Stangeland, Vons's chairman and chief executive officer, said the purchase of Safeway's four Southern California operating units &quot;will allow us to leverage off our existing base and fully capture the cost efficiencies of a larger, tightly networked chain.&quot;    Jonathan Ziegler, senior supermarket and retailing industry analyst for San Francisco-based Sutro andamp; Co., said the transaction would &quot;put Vons firmly in the No. 1 market spot in Southern California.&quot;    Vons, which currently operates 193 stores in Southern California and southern Nevada, will acquire 172 Safeway stores and certain distribution and processing operations. Vons, which is based in El Monte, Calif., said it expects to close some of the Safeway stores after the acquisition, but added that &quot;closures will be kept to a minimum.&quot;    The announcement came late in the day after the market had closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Vons shares closed at $7.125 a share, up 50 cents.    Under the agreement, Vons will pay Safeway $325 million, including the payment of certain debt, plus 11.7 million newly issued Vons common shares representing a 30% stake in the company. In addition, Safeway may acquire an additional 5% of Vons common shares on the open market.    Oakland, Calif.-based Safeway was taken private last year in a $4.2 billion leveraged buy-out arranged by investment bankers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The transaction was at the time the largest ever leveraged buy-out, and it left Safeway with $5.6 billion of debt. Safeway has since sold off much of its assets to pay down the debt. The company had 2,392 stores before the buy-out and would have 1,510 after the sale to Vons.    For the 36 weeks ended Sept. 12, Safeway had a net loss of $103.1 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $110.1 million. Sales for the period were $13.11 billion, compared with $13.7 billion a year earlier, when the company owned more stores.    Vons said it expects to finance the cash portion of the transaction with bank credit, by issuing new debt, or a combination of both. It added that with the equity from the Safeway operations, its debt level as a percentage of capitalization won't change significantly from the current 78%. Safeway's Southern California operations generated sales of about $1.6 billion in 1986, and Vons's stores generated about $3 billion in sales.    The transaction, which the companies expect to complete by early next summer, is subject to approval by Vons's shareholders and review under federal antitrust law.    Vons may encounter roadblocks in getting the necessary regulatory approval. In August, the Federal Trade Commission voted to block the $114 million sale of 59 Safeway stores in Texas and New Mexico to Lubbock, Texas.-based Supermarket Development Corp. on the ground that it would reduce competition among grocery stores in the two states. Supermarket Development later agreed to sell stores in 12 cities and towns in the two states to win FTC approval.    Vons went public in July after merging with Allied Supermarkets Inc. and then selling Allied's Detroit operations in a management-led buy-out. Vons itself was taken private in a management-led buy-out in January 1986. That buyout included the Bass Investment Limited Partnership, an investment vehicle of the Bass brothers in Fort Worth, Texas.    In a leveraged buy-out, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
