The president caused quite a stink last month when he vetoed the Clean Water Act, passed unanimously on election eve by the 99th Congress, on grounds that the price tag was three times the amount he had requested in his 1987 budget. The chairman of the House Public Works Committee, Rep. James Howard (D., N.J.), vows to reintroduce the water bill &quot;word for word&quot; on the first day of the new session.    The new Senate Environment and Public Works Committee chairman, Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, intends to do the same thing in the upper chamber. If Mr. Reagan vetoes the water bill this time around, observers say Congress will override it.    In his veto message, Mr. Reagan expressed his commitment to &quot;the act's objectives,&quot; particularly its provisions for expanded pollution enforcement in certain areas, and less stringent regulatory and financial burdens on cities dealing with storm-water discharges. The provision the president couldn't abide called for massive expenditures on construction of sewage-treatment plants.    In last year's budget, Mr. Reagan proposed phasing out the Environmental Protection Agency's sewage-treatment construction-grant program by 1990. He asked for $6 billion in new money that, along with $3 billion left over in the construction fund, would have been used to complete projects already under construction. However, the bill that finally crossed his desk would have spent $18 billion on construction, while phasing out the program over 10 years.    The flap over this water bill reveals again how degraded the federal budgeting process has become. Programs that receive authorization for a limited time span develop constituencies that come to see these federal outlays as entitlements in perpetuity. The waste-treatment construction-grant program was created in 1972 as part of the Clean Water Act. Prior to that, state and local governments assumed roughly 90% of construction costs for waste-treatment plants, with the feds providing the remainder.    Since 1972, the federal government has spent roughly $40 billion to help state and local governments construct sewage plants. Until 1984, the government was assuming three-quarters of construction costs; now it's a little more than half. More than 5,500 waste-treatment systems have been built with the help of federal dollars. An additional 350 are on the way. Money to construct secondary sewage-treatment plants has been spread, as a kind of universal right, across districts throughout the country. The bottom line is that the sewage-treatment needs that precipitated the waste-treatment construction-grant program almost 15 years ago are now being met, or would be met by the scheduled phase-out in 1990.    The issue here is not clean water. It is Washington's political patronage. Rep. Howard and his colleagues make hay with the folks back home by directing fat federal grants their way. The water bill is a convenient vehicle. But Ronald Reagan stands in their way. With the prospect of a veto, he has expressed his opposition to waste -- not the kind treated in sewage plants, but the kind treated in congressional appropriations. </TEXT></DOC>
