Afew weeks later, a city councilman was found dead after exposingmembers of a car theft ring.   On the surface, such incidents appear regrettably routine in acity with one of the world's highest crime rates. But in both casesofficials admit the crimes were carried out by police.   Hardly a day passes without newspapers reporting crimes ofviolence in Manila and elsewhere that were carried out by the verypeople charged with protecting society.   During the first seven months of 1988, 67 policemen were firedfor involvement in crimes nationwide. Most were assigned in theManila area. Of the 67 policemen, 18 were charged with murder,according to official figures.   Cicero Campos, chairman of the National Police Commission, saidhis agency receives an average of 1,500 complaints each year ofcriminal activity among the country's 52,000 policemen.   But he admits the figure represents ``the tip of the iceberg''because the majority of crimes committed by police and soldiers arenever reported.   Much of the crime involves petty ``shakedowns.'' For example,traffic policemen extorting motorists for unauthorized, on-the-spot``fines'' are a common sight on Manila's busy thoroughfares.   Last month, Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, told a congressional committee that investigatorsrecently cracked a massive car-theft ring made up mostly ofsoldiers and police.   Montano said the arrests of the corrupt officers contributed toa significant reduction in the number of car thefts in the country.   Poorly paid policemen often moonlight as bouncers for bars andprostitution fronts. Others join crime syndicates involved ingambling, narcotics and prostitution, either by guaranteeing themvirtual immunity from arrest or, in some cases, serving asbodyguards for mob leaders.   Policemen are widely assumed to have been involved in theunsolved slaying of leftist leaders.   Five policemen have been charged with the attempted murder inJune of leftist Nemesio Prudente, president of the PolytechnicUniversity of the Philippines. The officers, who were on duty whenthey allegedly attacked Prudente, are scheduled for arraignmentthis month.   Crimes committed by police rose to unprecedented levels duringthe 20-year rule of President Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted onFeb. 25, 1986, after a civilian-military uprising that propelledCorazon Aquino to the presidency.   Many soldiers and police joined the uprising against Marcos.Once in office, Mrs. Aquino pledged to restore honest governmentand end abuses by police and soldiers. But the police department'simage, as well as the government's own prestige, is now threatenedby a resurgence of corruption.   Julie Yap Daza, a prominent newspaper and broadcast commentator,wrote in the Manila Standard that corruption has reachedunacceptable levels.   ``Police corruption is not unique to us, all right,'' she wrote.``But this is corruption with a different face, the face ofperversion.... It is a dark time for the good cops, if there areany left.''   Campos, a retired Constabulary brigadier general, blames theproblem on low salaries. A patrolman receives a monthly startingsalary of $50, well below the government's poverty line of $120 amonth for a family of five.   ``We do not have a coterie of angels or saints in the policeforce,'' he said in an interview. ``But certainly these people areall humans, and they are up for temptation. Perhaps what we can dois insulate them from temptation.''   He said the commission has recommended that Congress increasepolice salaries as a step toward curbing corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
