By an 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that a 1984 federal lawrequires an Omaha, Neb., high school to accommodate aBible-reading club that students wanted to organize.</LP><TEXT>   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, thecourt said the law treats extracurricular activities as partof a public forum created by the school. The federal law, thecourt said, means the school can't discriminate against useof the public forum based on a club's religious, political orphilosophical views. This approach, Justice O'Connor said,doesn't violate the First Amendment's separation of churchand state.   The eight justices in the majority were split into threeopinions. Six of them, including Justice O'Connor, appearedto believe that the federal law is constitutional in allrespects. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scaliadiffered on how to analyze freedom of religion issues underthe First Amendment, but not on the law's validity.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice WilliamBrennan, agreed that the law was constitutional as applied tothe Omaha school, but they warned that school officials mustbe careful to disassociate themselves from the religiousmessage of the club.   Justice John Stevens dissented.   Officials at the Omaha school refused to allow thereligious club to meet, but a federal appeals court in St.Louis ruled that the federal law required accommodation ofthe club. The high court affirmed the appeals court ruling.(Westside Community Board of Education vs. Mergens)</TEXT></DOC>
