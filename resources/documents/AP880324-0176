The Soviet Union, charging Pakistan with bad faith, had refusedto complete an agreement for withdrawal of an estimated 120,000troops from the war-torn country.   Initially, the United States supported the demand of its ally,which is negotiating terms of a settlement with the Afghangovernment through a United Nations mediator.   But the Reagan administration subsequently back-pedaled _ whilepressing its own demand that the Soviets cease their military aidto the Marxist government.   The U.S. official said Pakistan was now willing to have the RedArmy retreat even while the U.N. mediator, Diego Cordovez,consulted with warring factions on formation of a transitiongovernment.   ``The interim government issue, which has been an obstacle, isnow swiftly soluble,'' he said.   The official, who played a leading role in talks here this weekwith Soviet officials, briefed reporters under rules that gave himanonymity.   Pakistan had contended that the safe return of millions ofAfghan refugees to their homeland would not be possible under thecurrent government in Kabul.   The U.S. official said the only major remaining issue was aU.S.-Soviet dispute on military aid.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Wednesday night ruled outany agreement to end the war in Afghanistan unless the Soviet Unionsuspended military aid to the pro-Moscow government.   He said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had rejected theproposal, which would include a suspension in U.S. support for theAfghan resistance.   The moratorium would be in effect during the Soviet pullout andfor three additional months. The U.S. official said ``it wouldallow the dust to settle'' without prejudice to U.S. and Sovietclaims to back rival factions.   ``They didn't feel they could agree to that,'' Shultz said.   And yet, Shultz said, ``those conditions are needed for us to beable to sign as a guarantor'' of the Geneva agreement to end thewar.   Shevardnadze told reporters before flying home that the SovietUnion had no intention of stopping its aid to the Afghan government.   The aid is required by a Soviet-Afghan treaty, ``those arelegitimate supplies, and we are not going to rescind that treaty,''Shevardnadze said.   Shultz said the Soviets were willing to withdraw the Red Army bythe end of the year, beginning with a 50 percent pullout during thefirst three months in which the agreement was in effect.   The guarantee of a withdrawal filled ``a great big hole'' in thesituation, Shultz said.   But, he said, Soviet military aid to the Marxist government mustcease for stability to return to the war-torn country and for anestimated 5 million refugees to go home.   ``The proposal remains on the table,'' Shultz said. ``If ourthought or something close to it is accepted we would be pleased tosign on as a guarantor.''   The U.S. official who briefed reporters on Thursday said thepullout could be carried out over 7{ months.</TEXT></DOC>
