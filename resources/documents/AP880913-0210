WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis questioned on Tuesdaywhether Republican rival George Bush is up to dealing with Sovietleaders at a time when Soviet economic difficulties offer greatopportunities for the United States.   ``George Bush has been around Washington for a long time, but ifhe couldn't stand up to the ayatollah or say `no' to (PanamanianGen. Manuel) Noriega, how will he measure up to Gorbachev?''Dukakis said.   ``And if he truly believes that J. Danforth Quayle is qualifiedto be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust hisjudgment when America's future is on the line,'' he said.   Dukakis spoke to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations inwhat campaign aides described as a major address outlining his viewof U.S.-Soviet relations. It was part of a week devoted largely tonational security issues by the Democratic presidential nominee,who is trying to counter the Republicans' depiction of him as softon defense.   Dukakis intensified that effort later at a General Dynamics tankfacility in Sterling Heights, Mich., where he donned a helmet androde in a M-1 Abrams tank, the military's top battlefield tank, andpledged to make strengthening conventional weapons among his topdefense priorities.   Dukakis stood through the hatch of the tank, his hand resting ona 7.62 mm machine gun, the tank's turret and cannon spinning, asthe tank was driven at high speed around a grassy field.   He said the Reagan administration had tried to cut tankproduction by one-quarter and asserted that Bush would cutconventional military spending to finance the Star Wars nucleardefense program.   Dukakis planned to address defense and weapons in a speechWednesday in Washington. Aides scheduled a stop in Yellowstonepark, to view fire damage, on his way to California Thursday.   In his Chicago speech, Dukakis said the next president must``seize the intiative'' in dealing with the Soviets. However, hesaid Bush ``has no strategy for testing the limits of what iscalled `new thinking' in the Soviet Union.''   He said the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev has aneconomy facing difficulty in providing for its people and thatGorbachev wants access to Western technology, resources and trade.   ``Mr. Gorbachev wants to make his country part of theinternational economic community,'' Dukakis said. ``What is heprepared to do in return? Will we allow him to pursue that strategyunchallenged, or will we have a strategy of our own to rotectAmerican interests and translate Soviet economic weakness intoimproved Soviet behavior in world affairs?''   Dukakis said he would deal firmly with the Soviets and saidGorbachev is a Leninist who ``has not abandoned Soviet goals.''   He said, ``It would be naive to take Gorbachev at his word, butit would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered.''   Dukakis said he would challenge the Soviets to reduce Europeantroops, cool regional conflicts, end the spread of nuclear andchemical weapons and missiles, reject terrorism and allow theemigration of Jews and other minorities.   ``Mr. Gorbachev must understand that if there is to be afundamental change in the relationship of his country with theWestern world, there must first be a fundamental change in thebalance of forces in central Europe,'' Dukakis said.   He said he wanted to build on the Intermediate-range NuclearForces reduction agreement and would challenge Gorbachev toeliminate a Soviet advantage in tanks and artillery in Europe,``not just by demobilizing those weapons but by destroying them.''He also said he would seek to have the Soviets withdraw troops``back into the Ukraine.''   Dukakis hammered at his theme that Sen. Quayle, Bush's runningmate, was not up to dealing forcefully with the Soviets. He notedthat three vice presidents since 1945 have been propelled suddenlyto the presidency and that all of them later met as president withSoviet leaders.   ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford,'' Dukakis said. ``He's no LyndonJohnson. And he sure ain't Harry Truman. Can we stake our future onthe hope that he is a match for Mikhail Gorbachev?''   Dukakis wrapped up the day in Washington, where in a speech tothe Congressional Hispanic Caucus he said Reagan's appointment of aHispanic, Lauro F. Cavazos, to Secretary of Education, was toolittle too late.   ``For some people it's enough to wake up after eight years andcreate opportunity for one Hispanic,'' he said. ``I want to standwith you and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanics.''</TEXT></DOC>
