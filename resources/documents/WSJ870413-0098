Lawmakers and law enforcement officials said the inquiries began late last week after FBI Director William Webster told a closed meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee about the classified documents found in the agency's criminal files. The committee is considering Mr. Webster's nomination to head the Central Intelligence Agency.    According to these sources, Mr. Webster also told the committee that the material indicates some low-level FBI officials collected information about arms sales to Iran long before the secret policy was publicly disclosed last November.    But the FBI chief told lawmakers that he and other senior bureau managers didn't find out about the documents until last week, according to two members of the committee. Law enforcement officials said the bureau also started a &quot;high-priority&quot; internal inquiry to determine why the documents weren't brought to the attention of senior agency officials months ago. They also want to know whether any agents or supervisors may have tried to cover up their knowledge of the secret arms sales.    Before discovering the documents, FBI officials maintained that only Mr. Webster and one of his senior aides, Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, knew about the Reagan administration's dealings with Iran before they became public.    The FBI and Mr. Walsh declined to comment, and details about the contents of the documents couldn't be learned.    But Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) acknowledged in an interview last week that Mr. Webster turned over &quot;additional documents involving arms sales to Iran.&quot; The new information, he said, &quot;doesn't indicate, in any way, improper knowledge on Mr. Webster's part.&quot;    The committee, in turn, provided the documents to Mr. Walsh and the Senate select committee investigating the Iran-Contra scandal.    Despite the inquiries, Mr. Webster is expected to easily win Senate confirmation as CIA director this month. The new documents, however, raise questions about the bureau's knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair and about its internal search for information relevant to Mr. Walsh's investigation.    During the public portion of his testimony, Mr. Webster told lawmakers, &quot;there is nothing that I have instructed not be made available to you.&quot; And he promised &quot;not to be devious or cute with the committee&quot; in providing information about covert operations.    Last Wednesday, the committee confronted Mr. Webster with an internal FBI memo indicating that former National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North shouldn't receive certain classified information because he could face a criminal investigation for efforts to help Nicaraguan insurgents, or Contras. Mr. Webster confirmed he had read the October memo, but told lawmakers he didn't think it was relevant to the committee's efforts to determine the FBI's role in the Iran-Contra affair.    After the hearings, law enforcement officials and lawmakers said the memo concerned private aid for Eugene Hasenfus, an American who was arrested in Nicaragua after his cargo plane carrying weapons to the Contras was shot down. Intelligence Committee member Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), in an interview, asserted that the memo clearly was relevant and criticized Mr. Webster for failing to turn it over. </TEXT></DOC>
