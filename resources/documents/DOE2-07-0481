That is, the lossincrement after its use under low dose rate for 20 years - 25 years isestimated for the purpose of design of the system. In the optical fiberhaving a Ge doped quartz core without metallic impurities, the loss incrementis known to be dependent on the dose rate similarly to the case of purequartz. The loss increment of this optical fiber was estimated for theextended exposure at low dose rate. The loss increment in the wholly-synthetic,Ge doped core, optical fiber is negligibly small; its initial loss issmall and it is in a high band. The optical fiber is thus widely applicablefor the system under radiation requiring large-capacity transmission.(Mori, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
