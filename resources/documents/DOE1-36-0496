Each patientunderwent perfusion lung scan at diagnosis then 7, 30 and 180 days later;i.v. heparin was systematically administered for one week after diagnosis,followed by oral warfarin for six months. Blood flow impairment was evaluatedby assessing the total number of unperfused lung segments (ULS), as calculatedon both lateral views at each scan. The number of ULS was significantlyreduced at each interval (Pandless;0.001), ranging from 8.4+-3.3 at diagnosisto 3.6+-2.7 six months later; most of the recovery (79%) occurred withinthe first month. No patient had complete restoration of pulmonary bloodflow during the whole follow-up period. No difference was found betweenthe number of ULS in right lung versus that in left lung at each interval.Recovery of blood flow was heavily affected by coexisting cardiac orpulmonary disease. In fact, those patients with underlying cardiopulmonarydisease (49.2% of the total) showed significantly smaller perfusion improvementafter six months (Pandless;0.001). Eight patients (6 with and 2 without cardiopulmonarydisease) had clinical and scintigraphic evidence of recurrent embolismduring the follow-up period.</TEXT></DOC>
