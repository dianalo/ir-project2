(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man's plan to open his ranch to commercialtrout fishing has angered his rural neighbors and led to complaintsabout gunshots, vandalism and the poisoning of two ponds filledwith dozens of large fish.   The neighbors, including ``gonzo'' journalist Hunter S.Thompson, oppose the commercial fishing operation because theyobject to further development in the Woody Creek community outsideAspen.   Floyd Watkins, owner of Beaver Run Ranch, has reported severalincidents in recent days, including obscenities scrawled in hisfresh concrete driveway, shotgun blasts fired near his ranch andthe near-fatal poisoning of his dog.   In addition, he says someone erected a sign on his propertysaying, ``Fat Floyd's Trout Farm _ Public Fishing Welcome,'' andsomeone cut down signs on Watkins' property announcing the BeaverRun Ranch.   There also have been several verbal confrontations, includingthose involving Watkins and Thompson, authorities said.   Then, the dispute escalated Wednesday from the civil complaintlevel to a full criminal investigation with the poisoning of twofish ponds.   ``It's gone beyond the shouting, name-calling thing, even thenoise-making side of it, because now we have fish killed andpoisoning of a waterway,'' said Pitkin County Deputy SheriffMichael Kendrick. ``(It is) now criminal in nature.''   The sheriff's investigation includes a variety of otherincidents that have been reported in the Woody Creek area. A focalpoint of the investigation is the dispute between Watkins and hisneighbors.   People downstream along the creek were being warned againstdrinking the water, eating fish from it or having livestock use thewater _ until the poison that was used can be identified, Kendricksaid.   Mac Myers, deputy district attorney, said prosecutors werereviewing the incidents and allegations to decide whether anycharges would be filed.   Samples of the dead fish and the water were sent for analysis;the results were not immediately available. Pitkin CountyEnvironmental Health Department officials said they suspect thesubstance used was rotenone, an agent designed specifically to killfish by reducing the oxygen content in water.   Watkins reported 80 percent of the fish in two ponds on hisproperty killed, and estimated the loss at 3,000 pounds of fish,worth about $40,000.   ``Those fish (up to 20-pounds each) are worth 500 bucks apiece.These are trophy fish,'' he said.   The substance apparently was put into the creek above Watkins'property sometime late Tuesday, with the fish kill evident onWednesday, Kendrick said.   ``We don't have any physical evidence _ tire tracks or bootprints,'' Kendrick said. ``We'll probably find out what thechemical is (but that won't) necessarily lead us anywhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
