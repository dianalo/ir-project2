Their assessment came Tuesday after House and Senate leaders ofboth parties failed again to unravel their differences over theproposed capital gains tax reduction.   The argument has delayed Senate debate on a related $14 billiondeficit-cutting bill. Unless that legislation is passed by Monday,automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs _ expected tototal about $16 billion _ will take effect.   ``You're not going to avoid'' the cutbacks, Senate MinorityLeader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said after a nearly two-hour privatesession. ``I think we're all pretty much in agreement on that.''   Dole met in the Capitol with Senate Democratic Leader GeorgeMitchell of Maine, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., andHouse Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.   Mitchell said he believed the chances of avoiding theGramm-Rudman reductions are ``extremely remote.''   The air of defeat has arisen because of the complicated disputethat has tied up congressional leaders for the past week.   Republican senators are preparing to force the chamber to voteon a plan to lower the capital gains tax in an effort to honorBush's campaign pledge for a cut in the rate. Bush says a rate cutwill stimulate economic activity and boost federal revenues.   Democratic leaders oppose the idea, arguing it would cost thegovernment billions of dollars in the long run.   But the Democratic leadership is on the defensive, realizingthat most senators favor some capital gains reduction, and so theyare trying to reach an agreement with the GOP that would prevent acapital gains amendment _ and other controversial issues _ frombeing added to the deficit-reduction bill.   Attaching capital gains language to the budget bill _ consideredan urgent, must-pass measure _ would greatly increase prospects fora cut in the tax rate.   Each party has been seeking parliamentary arrangements forvoting that would give them procedural advantages in any floorvotes.   The House also complicated matters last week when it approved an$11 billion deficit-slashing bill of its own. That measure includeda two-year capital gains cut, a shrinkage of Medicare benefits forextremely ill elderly patients, an expansion of federal day careprograms and other initiatives.   Working out a way to pare those items from the legislation _ andfor the House and Senate to agree to a compromise bill _ makes itall but impossible to finish the task by next Monday, leadersconcede.   ``The time to have stripped the bill down ... was before weenacted it,'' Foley told reporters.   The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projecteddeficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, is not below$110 billion.   The Congressional Budget Office projected Tuesday that theshortfall will be $141.3 billion. This would call for cuts of $41.3billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs.   The CBO projections, however, are merely advisory. The WhiteHouse's Office of Management and Budget issues its bindingprojections Monday. They are expected to require about $16 billionin cuts, divided equally between defense and domestic programs.   Congress, as it has done in the past, could undo any cuts withfuture legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
