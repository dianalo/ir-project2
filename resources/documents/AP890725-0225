In the first incident, 300 Shining Path rebels late Mondayattacked a police post in rural Acobamba with dynamite andautomatic weapons fire, police said.   Four of the 30 officers at the post and three rebels werekilled. Police said the survivors abandoned the post after anhour-long battle.   The rebels then blew up the station and the city hall, andransacked stores in the town, located 175 miles southeast of Lima.   The attackers made off with arms, medicine, food and clothing,police said.   Troops were dispatched to Acobamba to pursue the guerrillas,police said.   In a second clash, at least 15 guerrillas from the Tupac AmaruRevolutionary Movement Tuesday attacked a Lima police post withgrenades, dynamite and rifle fire. Five rebels were killed in a gunbattle and the others fled, police reported.   They said there were no casualties among the 15 officers insidethe station, located in the Pueblo Libre working-class section ofLima.   Tupac Amaru rebels advocate Cuban-style Marxism.   Police said the rebels painted slogans on nearby walls and hungTupac Amaru flags near the station.   The guerrillas also set off bombs in three nearby banks and atelephone office, damaging the buildings and breaking windows,according to police.   The movement has been fighting Peru's elected governments since1984. It takes its name from an 18th century hero who led a peasantrevolt against Spanish rule in the Peruvian highlands.   Estimates of the number of activists in the organization rangefrom 500 to 1,500. On April 28, 62 Tupac Amaru guerrillas werekilled when they were surprised by a military patrol near thehighland town of Jauja.   The movement is smaller and considered less violent than theShining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that took up arms againstthe government in 1980.   The Shining Path began its guerrilla war in the city ofAyacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, but has since spread itsinfluence through much of the Andean highlands and into thecoca-producing jungle regions of the northeast.   The government says more than 15,000 people _ many of thempeasants caught in crossfire between guerrillas and troops _ havebeen killed in violence related to the insurgencies.</TEXT></DOC>
