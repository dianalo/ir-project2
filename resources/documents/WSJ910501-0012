Many investors consider buying and selling by a company'sofficers, directors and other insiders to be a valuableindicator of the outlook for the company's business and thedirection of its stock.</LP><TEXT>   Starting today, a company won't be featured in the table's&quot;Companies&quot; section unless three or more insiders have boughtor sold its shares in the past 12 weeks -- and then only ifthe insiders' transactions totaled more than $100,000 amongthem. Routine option-related sales will be eliminated, orlabeled as such. And a footnote will disclose which tardyexecutives missed the federal deadline for filing theirtransactions.   The changes are primarily meant to better highlightsignificant &quot;clusters&quot; of insider trading, in which more thanone officer, director or major shareholder buys or sellsshares in a short period of time. Previously, the tablefeatured companies where as few as two insiders had bought orsold shares.   The data on which the table is based are provided by theinsiders themselves in reports filed with the Securities andExchange Commission. These filings are tracked and analyzedby Invest/Net of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.   Hundreds of thousands of insider transactions are filedevery year, said Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net, andthe changes are aimed at &quot;trying to get down to the core datathat would help investors.&quot; The last several years of insiderdata indicate that stock trades by three or more insidersacting &quot;in a relatively compact period of time offer a betterclue&quot; to investors than trades by just one or two insiders.   The changes in the Insider Trading Spotlight come at thesame time the SEC is making some changes in itsinsider-trading regulations. As a result of the new rules,which go into effect today, many middle-management executivesare now exempt from the filing requirements. With fewerinsiders overall filing their transactions, clusters of threeinsiders will occur less often and, potentially, may be moremeaningful. Also, the window of insider activity highlightedin the table has been lengthened to 12 weeks from eightweeks.   The table now excludes or clearly labels insider stocksales that are related to the exercise of options. That isbecause such sales generally don't involve market-timingdecisions; instead, the insiders involved typically sell thestock as soon as they are permitted to under SEC rules, orshortly thereafter. For purposes of the table, a sale of 90%or more of an insider's option-related shares within ninemonths of the exercise of the options is considered anoption-related transaction.   For instance, consider the example of a company presidentwho exercised options to buy shares in January 1990 and soldthe stock six months later, the earliest point the SEC thenallowed. The sale would be excluded from the table as aroutine option-related sale unless it were one of the top-10individual sales in dollar value reported to the SEC in theprevious week. In that case, the sale would be featured inthe &quot;Individuals&quot; section, but it would be labeled asoption-related.   Under the new SEC rules, the required six-month holdingperiod starts when the options are granted, not when they'reexercised. So executives will be able to sell sharesimmediately after they've acquired them. In six months, whenthe holding period for the last of the shares acquired underthe previous rule expires, the Journal will review its policyof excluding option-related sales.   One additional change in the table relates to thetimeliness of insiders' reports. Insiders must reportpurchases and sales of their companies' shares by the 10th ofthe month following the trade. But more than one-fourth ofthe insiders' filings come in after deadline, according toSEC officials. The SEC has said it will more aggressivelypursue late filers.   Starting today, the Journal's Insider Trading Spotlighttable will identify, with a dagger-shaped footnote, insiderswho file late.   ---   ALL IN THE FAMILY: Several family and charitable truststhat own shares in Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of thisnewspaper, have filed intentions with the Securities andExchange Commission to trim their holdings. According todocuments filed with the federal agency on April 17, 263,070Class A shares will be shortly sold or have already beensold. At the time of the filing, the shares were valued bythe trustees at about $6.5 million at an average share priceof $24.875.   Roger May, spokesman for Dow Jones, said, &quot;It's ourunderstanding that these are routine quarterly sales thetrusts have been making for years.&quot; Roy A. Hammer, anattorney for the Barron-Bancroft family, which has held themajority ownership in Dow Jones since 1902, said &quot;the pace{of selling} is above last year, but it is still at a verymodest level, and the purpose is for market diversification.&quot;   The trusts, which hold stock on behalf of several membersof the Barron-Bancroft family, are selling shares thatrepresent, in aggregate, less than 1% of the family's totalClass A and Class B shares, SEC documents show.   The largest sale was made by the Hugh Bancroft Jr. trust,which is a major shareholder of the company. The sale was of87,131 shares, on top of a sale of 100,001 shares earlierthis year, SEC filings show. In total, the trust has trimmed3% of its holdings in 1991; it retains 6.6 million Class Ashares, the filings show.
