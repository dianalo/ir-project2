Schrempp, the45-year-old chairman of Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche AerospaceAG unit, has spent eight months stitching four disparate WestGerman aerospace companies into a cohesive whole.   Now, his handiwork is on display to the world.</LP><TEXT>   Deutsche Aerospace is here at the big biennial show takingup at least half the space in the German pavilion with itsairplanes and a plush hospitality chalet.   It is a heady time for the four companies involved, eachof which is at least 50%-owned by Deutsche Aerospace, whichwas establshed in May 1989 to embrace Daimler's aerospaceactivities. Placed together, Deutsche Aerospace's productrange is vast and its potential appears enormous.   The four companies involved are: Dornier G.m.b.H., a makerof small aircraft; Motoren andamp; Turbinen-Union G.m.b.H., knownas MTU, which makes engines; defense contractorMesserschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., known as MBB; andTelefunken Systemtechnik G.m.b.H., a maker of defenseelectronics gear.   Deutsche Aerospace is participating in the building ofAirbus Industrie jetliners, engines from United TechnologiesCorp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit in the U.S., a proposedEurofighter project, radar systems, the Tornado fighter,medical systems and helicopters. Besides MBB, AirbusIndustrie's partners are Aerospatiale of France, BritishAerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   &quot;If you're not one who can say, `I can do everything,' youdon't get the juicy piece of the steak,&quot; Mr. Schrempp says.   But the banquet hasn't quite begun. Although mightyDaimler-Benz has made progress in reorganizing its newaerospace acquisitions, the project is far from complete.Until it is, Deutsche Aerospace will find it difficult tobite into the meaty military, airliner and helicopterprojects the world's aerospace concerns are increasinglydoing in partnerships.   Nevertheless, Mr. Schrempp says, the continuing work means&quot;we are bringing much more to the table&quot; than when the fourcompanies were small, lacking in resources and participatingin industrial ventures only on an ad hoc basis.   Today, &quot;there is no company in the world that is going tomake a plane on its own,&quot; he says. &quot;But we want to take alead&quot; in such partnerships. And only as the larger, richerand more-focused Deutsche Aerospace can German industryapproach such ventures as equals of U.S. defense companiesor, closer to home, of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale S.A.and Aeritalia S.p.A.   Hence the announcements at the show that DeutscheAerospace is talking to partners about joint helicopterprojects in Europe and the U.S. and about a European regionaljetliner. The company also reiterated that its wide-rangingdiscussions with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan arecontinuing.   But it is a big job to amalgamate four companies and tostrive for synergies with Daimler-Benz, which itself has beenreorganized. &quot;We have made a good start but we aren'tfinished,&quot; Mr. Schrempp says. &quot;At some levels, we are verythin. Elsewhere, we have to reduce the bureaucracy. We haveto restructure the production side. Dornier and MBB werefierce competitors. Now, they have to be friends.&quot;   On the organizational chart, the plan is to regroupactivities among the four companies by functions. Thus,Dornier's airplanes and MBB's participation in Airbus will begrouped into the aircraft division, while pieces of variouscompanies' satellite and space activities will be funneledinto the space division. The other two divisions are defensesystems and propulsion systems.   The cleanup exercise also means minority holdings in twoDeutsche Aerospace companies must be sorted out. The state ofHamburg recently swapped its 7% stake in MBB for a piece ofDeutsche Aerospace, Mr. Schrempp said. But Bremen and Bavariastill hold 24% of MBB. Bremen has said it wants to sell itsshares, but a sale or swap will have to be organized withBavaria. Likewise, Deutsche Aerospace is in talks withmembers of the Dornier family -- who hold 18% of the votingrights and 46% of equity in Dornier -- to win the freedom tomanage the company.   There are other details to attend to. At the end of 1996,Deutsche Aerospace must buy Bonn's 20% stake in DeutscheAirbus, the MBB unit that participates in Airbus Industrie.But that sale is conditional on a number of things, includingAirbus becoming a corporation instead of a murky grouping ofindustrial interests.</TEXT></DOC>
