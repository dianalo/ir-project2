The heel portion has a rearward side portion      with an aperture therein to permit visual examination of the rearward      portion of a patient's heel when the foot splint is mounted on one of the      patient's feet. A stabilizer bar is pivotally secured by one of its ends      to the leg portion. Ratchet teeth are located on one end of the stabilizer      bar and on the leg portion at the location of its pivotal connection to      the stabilizer bar to permit the stabilizer bar to be selectively held in      a fixed position with respect to the leg portion. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This application is a continuation of co-pending application Ser. No.      07/247,104 filed Sep. 20, 1988, and is now U.S. Pat. No. D317,651. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Therapeutic leg and foot splints are commonly used on bedfast patients to      correct or facilitate the healing of a variety of problems relating to the      patient's feet. The functional aspects of such splints are disclosed and      fully discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,976,059 issued Aug. 24, 1976. The      splint of that patent discloses a curved heel portion that is enlarged      with respect to a patient's foot to permit lateral visible examination of      the patient's heel. That patent also discloses a stabilizer bar which can      extend laterally from the back of the splint to hold the splint, and hence      the patient's foot or leg, in a predetermined desirable position. </PAR><PAR>  However, since the sores on a bedfast patient's heel are commonly on the      rearward surface of the heel, the splint of said patent does not permit      full visibility of the patient's heel. Furthermore, the stabilizer bar of      this patent does not have sufficient interlocking surfaces with the splint      to always prevent the stabilizer bar from becoming disaligned from its      desired predetermined position. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, it is a principal object of this invention to provide a plastic      foot splint which has an aperture in the rearward portion of the heel to      permit visual examination of the rearward portion of a patient's heel who      is wearing the splint. Visibility is gained through the aperture of this      invention, depending on the position of the patient, either by direct      visual contact, or by the use of a mirror held in spaced relation to the      aperture. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to provide interlocking ratchet teeth      between one end of the stabilizer bar and the rearward surface of the leg      portion of the splint to insure that the stabilizer bar will not be      inadvertently moved from its desired position by the weight of the      patient's leg or movement of the patient's leg. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art. </PAR><PAC>  BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention pertains to a plastic foot splint having a horizontal foot      portion, a contoured upstanding leg portion and a heel portion connecting      the foot and leg portions. The heel portion has a rearward side portion      with an aperture therein to permit visual examination of the rearward      portion of a patient's heel when the foot splint is mounted on one of the      patient's feet. </PAR><PAR>  A stabilizer bar is pivotally secured by one of its ends to the leg      portion. Ratchet teeth are located on one end of the stabilizer bar and on      the leg portion at the location of its pivotal connection to the      stabilizer bar to permit the stabilizer bar to be selectively held in a      fixed position with respect to the leg portion. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a top plan view of the foot splint of this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a rear elevational view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a typical side elevational view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a bottom plan view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a front elevational view thereof; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a perspective view thereof. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Foot splint 10 is comprised of a generally horizontal foot portion 12, a      substantially vertical leg portion 14, both of which are interconnected by      a curved heel portion 16. The splint is preferably comprised of a      resilient plastic material and is preferably of integral construction. The      leg portion 14 is contoured to fit the calf of a patient wearing the      splint. The curved heel portion 16 has an enlarged radius so that the heel      portion is typically in spaced relation to the rearward portion of a      patient's heel who is wearing the splint. </PAR><PAR>  A toe plate 18 is adjustably secured to the forward end of foot portion 12      by connector 20. The toe plate does not comprise a part of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  Heel portion 16 has a rearward side 22. An elliptical shaped aperture 24 is      formed in the rear side 22 of heel portion 16 to permit visual access to      the rearward side of a patient's heel who is wearing the splint. Depending      on the position of the patient, the rearward side of the heel can be      viewed directly through aperture 24, or can be seen by placing a mirror in      spaced relation to the aperture so that the rearward portion of the heel      can be seen in the mirror. </PAR><PAR>  A shoulder 26 extends outwardly from the rear side 27 of leg portion 14 as      best shown in FIG. 3. A stabilizer bar 28 is secured by its lower end 30      to shoulder 26 by means of a plurality of ratchet teeth 32 which are      formed both in the shoulder 26 and in the lower end of the stabilizer bar.      The ratchet teeth 32 on the stabilizer bar and the shoulder are held in      any desired position by any conventional connector 34 which typically is a      threaded bushing which holds the stabilizer bar 28 in a fixed position      when tightened, and which permits stabilizer 28 to be moved to an      alternate position when loosened. Typically, the stabilizer bar 28, shown      in its inoperative position in FIG. 3, will be rotated in a lateral      direction to counteract any tendency of the patient's foot to rotate in an      inner or outer direction. The stabilizer bar 28 performs essentially the      same function as the stabilizer bar in said U.S. Pat. No. 3,976,059, with      the invention herein dwelling in the specific ratchet tooth connection      between the stabilizer bar and the leg portion of the splint. </PAR><PAR>  The ratchet teeth 32 make it virtually impossible for the leg or lateral      movement of the patient's leg or foot to alter the predetermined position      of the stabilizer bar with respect to the splint. </PAR><PAR>  Slots 36 are adapted to receive suitable straps or the like for attaching      the splint to the leg of the patient. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, from the foregoing, it is seen that this invention accomplishes at      least its stated objectives. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
