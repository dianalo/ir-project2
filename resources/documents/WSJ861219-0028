The GSA, the U.S.'s purchasing arm, said the one-year contract, which contains two annual renewal clauses, could bring the Rockville, Md., company annual revenue of $50 million to $75 million. The contract sets a $75 million limit on revenue from the stores and guarantees a minimum revenue of $100,000, according to a GSA spokesman.    MBI, which operates a chain of computer stores, had total sales of $117.9 million in the year ended Jan. 31. MBI had operated the stores in GSA offices in three cities until August, when an earlier contract expired. GSA said it renewed the award after receiving nine other proposals.    The stores, known as Office Technology Plus Retail Centers, enable federal agencies to buy personal computers, supplies and related services. The contract requires discounts of between 35% and 38% on hardware, software and supplies. The stores, in Washington, Philadelphia and Atlanta, probably will reopen in mid-February, the GSA spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
