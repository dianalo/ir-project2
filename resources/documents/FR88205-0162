It provides information on (1) what records mustbe kept (2) who must keep them, (3) how long they must be kept, and (4)where the full provisions can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations.The Guide published in 1986 was revised as of January 1, 1986. This Supplementupdates the Guide as of January 1, 1988, and contains all changes to theGuide that have occurred since January 1, 1986. The changes indicated inbrackets occurred in 1987, unless otherwise noted.The Supplement is derived from the regulations published by the variousagencies in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>from January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1987.It was prepared under the direction of Richard L. Claypoole, Gladys QueenRamey was chief editor. Inquiries, telephone 202-523-3187. Suggestionsconcerning this publication may be sent to John E. Byrne, Director, Officeof the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration,Washington, DC 20408.<ITAG tagnum="84">Coverage</ITAG>In preparing both the Guide and the Supplement it was necessary to establishboundaries in order to stay within the intended purpose. The records coveredare those that address categories of activities conducted by individuals,businesses, and organizations for which retention requirements are expresslystated in Federal regulations.In many regulations there is an implied responsibility to keep copies ofreports and other papers furnished to Federal agencies. Such implied requirementshave not been included in the Guide and the Supplement.The following types of requirements also have been excluded:(1) Requirements involving the furnishing of reports to Government agencies,the filing of tax returns, or the submission of supporting evidence withapplications or claims.(2) Requirements involving the display of posters, notices, or other signsin places of business.(3) Requirements contained in individual Government contracts, unless thecontract provisions are incorporated in the Code of Federal Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arrangement</ITAG>The arrangement and numbering system in the Supplement follows the numberingsystem established for the Guide. The numbering in the Guide correspondsto the numbering in the CFR.For example, a record retention requirement relating to agriculture willbe found in the Guide under Title 7, Agriculture, and, further, under theagency which administers and enforces the regulation in which the recordretention requirement appears. The number to the left of the item is thepart and section number in Title 7 of the CFR in which the text of theregulation is printed. Because not all sections of the CFR contain recordretention requirements, the numbering in the Guide has gaps in the numericalsequence.Citation: Citations to the Guide and to the CFR are the same. An exampleis 7 CFR 17.17. The record retention requirement involved can be checkedin digest form in the Guide and in full text in the CFR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice</ITAG>The Guide to Record Retention Requirements and this Supplement do not havethe effect of law, regulation, or ruling. They comprise a guide to legalrequirements that appear to be in effect as of January 1, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,ns,tp9,p0,8/9,s200,r200</C><T4>List of Agencies and CFR Titles Appearing in This Supplement \1\</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p8,8/9,s100,xs48</C><H1>Agency</H1><H1>CFR Title</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Agriculture Department <D>7, 9, 36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Commerce Department <D>15, 48, 50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Commodity Futures Trading Commission <D>17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Defense Department <D>48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Education Department <D>34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Energy Department <D>10, 18, 48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Environmental Protection Agency <D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Farm Credit Administration <D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal Communications Commission <D>47</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal Emergency Management Agency <D>44</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal Home Loan Bank Board <D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal Reserve System <D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Federal Trade Commission <D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">General Services Administration <D>48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Health and Human Services Department <D>21, 42, 45</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Housing and Urban Development Department <D>24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Interior Department <D>30, 43</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Interstate Commerce Commission <D>49</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Justice Department <D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Labor Department <D>20, 29</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">National Aeronautics and Space Administration <D>14, 48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">National Archives and Records Administration <D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nuclear Regulatory Commission <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Postal Service <D>39</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Small Business Administration <D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation Department <D>14, 49</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury Department <D>19, 26, 27, 31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Veterans Administration <D>38</D><F>\1\ Agencies appear in this Supplement in CFR title numerical order.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Office of the Secretary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="82">7 CFR</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">17.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Importers and suppliers involved in sales of agricultural commodities.</ITAG>To maintain a record of all offers received from suppliers as a resultof public tenders or negotiation.Retention period: Until expiration of 3 years after final payment underthe purchase authorization.<ITAG tagnum="80">17.22</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Importers and suppliers involved in sales of agricultural commodities.</ITAG>See 17.6.<ITAG tagnum="52">Food and Nutrition Service</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="82">7 CFR</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">210.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cooperating State agencies, school food authorities, and food servicemanagement companies participating in the National School Lunch Program.</ITAG>To maintain (a) records and accounts pertaining to its school food service;(b) files of currently approved and denied, free and reduced price applications;and (c) individual applications for free and reduced price lunches submittedby families.
