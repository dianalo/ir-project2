Michael Dukakis, the Democraticfront-runner.   Here is some of they had to say recently:</TEXT><HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Daily Telegraph of London (conservative): ``Americans facea choice in November between dull men, but not dangerous ones, in arace that may be too close to call.''</TEXT><HEAD>CANADA</HEAD><TEXT>   _Maclean's (independent weekly news magazine): ``Both arecautious pragmatists who have throughout their careers eschewedsweeping ideological visions and popular stands. ... Both partiesare poised to select standard-bearers with a lack of flamboyanceafter eight years with a crowd-pleasing actor in the White House.''</TEXT><HEAD>CHILE</HEAD><TEXT>   _El Mercurio of Santiago (conservative): ``The presentpresidential campaign in the U.S. is increasingly looking like theone in 1976. That year, the Democratic candidate (Jimmy Carter) ... was a state governor, virtually unknown until shortly before,with no experience in federal politics, who based his politicalappeal on his personal honesty and his difference from the previouspresident (Gerald Ford). ... The man who will probably be thecandidate now is Michael Dukakis, Massachusetts governor, unknownto world opinion until a few months ago, a technocrat withoutcharisma.''</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD><TEXT>   _The South African Broadcasting Corp. (governent-controlled) ina commentary: ``So far, South Africa has not been a high-profileissue in the election campaign, despite the efforts of JesseJackson _ who will nevertheless undoubtedly have a hand in shapingthe Democratic Party's final election manifesto. Both Bush andDukakis believe in applying pressure on South Africa, but for Bush(who opposes sanctions) it should take the form of greaterinvolvement, whereas Dukakis (who supports further sanctions)appears to favor an isolationst approach. ... While Bush hasstrongly endorsed the Reagan policy on opposing Soviet expansionismby proxy _ in Angola, Central America and elsewhere _ Dukakis hascriticized all forms of American intervention in such conflictsituations.''</TEXT><HEAD>PERU</HEAD><TEXT>   _El Diario of Lima (communist): ``Whichever candidate wins, theimperialistic and warlike nature of the United States will notchange nor will its relations with Latin America, which, as weknow, are causing struggles for liberation and people's wars.''</TEXT></DOC>
