Incorporated New York, NY; Proposal to Engagein Placement As Agent of All Types of Securities </ITAG>J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Incorporated, New York, New York, has applied, pursuantto section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Houlding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8))and 225.23(a)), of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)), for permissionfor its subsidiary J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., New York, New York (JPMS''),to engage in the placement, as agent for issuers, of all types of securities.JPMS is currently authorized to underwrite and deal in, to a limited extent,certain securities. <T3>See J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Incorporated, The Chase Manhattan Corporation,Bankers Trust New York Corporation, Citicorp and Security Pacific Corporation,</T3>75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 192 (1989) (``<T3>J.P. Morgan et al.</T3>''); <T3>J.P. Morgan and Co. Incorporated, </T3>73 Federal Reserve Bulletin875 (1987); <T3>Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. Incorporated and Bankers Trust New YorkCorporation,</T3> 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987); and 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16).In addition, JPMS has received authorization to provide securities brokerageand investment advisory services on a combined basis to institutional customers.<T3>J.P. Morgan and Co. Incorporated, </T3>73 Federal Reserve Bulletin810 (1987). J.P. Morgan has applied to engage in the placement, as agent for issuers,of all types of securities within the limitations established by the Boardin <T3>J.P. Morgan et al., </T3>except that: (i) The proposal would involvethe placement of all types of securities, including equities; and (ii)the revenues from the proposed placement activities would be not be subjectto the five percent gross revenue limitation established in prior orderswhich limits JPMS's underwriting and dealing activities. The Board has not previously determined that the proposed activities arepermissible under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Houlding Company Act. Section4(c)(8) of the Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Boardapproval, engage in any activity ``which the Board after due notice andopportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be soclosely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be aproper incident thereto.'' J.P. Morgan contends that the proposed activities are closely related tobanking because banks, including its bank subsidiary, Morgan Guaranty TrustCompany of New York, are currently active participants in the private placementmarket. Under this proposal, J.P. Morgan would transfer the placement activitiescurrently conducted in its bank subsidiary to JPMS. In determining whether an activity is a proper incident to banking, theBoard must consider whether the proposal may ``reasonably be expected toproduce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increasedcompetition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects,such as undue concerntration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' J.P. Morgan maintainsthat permitting bank holding companies to engage in the proposed activitieswould result in greater convenience to customers and increased efficiencyin the provision of J.P. Morgan's placement services. J.P. Morgan contends that the proposed activities would not result in adverseeffects since the proposal would result in the shifting the placement activitiesout of the bank to a nonbank subsidiary. J.P. Morgan states that JPMS isregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is a memberof the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York StockExchange and hence is subject to the full range of state and federal securitieslaws including financial reporting, antifraud and financial responsibilityrules applicable to a broker-dealer. Moreover, J.P. Morgan notes that theframework of prudential limitations required by the Board's prior ordersreinforce the separation between JPMS and its banking affiliates and wouldsubject the proposed activities to restrictions that otherwise would notbe required if such activities continue to be performed in the bank. J.P. Morgan contends that the proposed activities do not raise an issueunder section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), relying on<T3>Securities Industry Ass'n v. Board of Governors,</T3> 807 F.2d 1052(D.C. Cir. 1986), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 107 S.Ct 3228 (1987). Section 20 of the Glass-SteagallAct prohibits the affiliation of a member bank, such as Morgan GuarantyTrust Company of New York, with a firm that is ``engaged principally''in the ``underwriting, public sale or distribution'' of securities. Any request for a hearing on this application must comply with andSection;262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)). The application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governorsor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
