The government and Contra rebels on Wednesday night agreed tothe cease-fire to negotiate an end to their war and signed anine-point accord that promises the rebels a role in Nicaragua'spolitical process.   ``Cease-Fire! Peace Explodes?'' read the eight-column headlinein El Nuevo Diario. Barricada, the official paper of the leftistSandinistas, said: ``The First Step Toward Peace.''   The agreement was the first concrete step toward ending theconflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.   State-run Radio Voice of Nicaragua in broadcasting thecease-fire softened its tones and referred to the rebels as ``theContras,'' instead of ``the mercenaries.''   El Nuevo Diario, in an editorial, offered a sombering note.   ``Is the mercenary directorate really disposed to fulfill theSapoa agreements?'' the editorial said. ``And if they are, are theycapable of maintaing their positions while facing a negativereaction from the president of the United States?''   The cease-fire is to begin April 1, with negotiators meetingagain April 6 in Managua to work out a permanent truce. In theinterim, a truce that took effect Monday is to remain in force.   President Daniel Ortega unexpectedly traveled to this smallvillage on the Costa Rican border for the signing, which followedthree days of talks.   He called the plan ``a great challenge for all Nicaraguans'' andcalled on the United States ``to support this effort and get readyto normalize its relations with Nicaragua.''   ``I think, I hope and I believe that we have made a start, afirm start to end this war that is killing ... sons of the samecountry, sons of the same mothers,'' said Contra leader AdolfoCalero.   Alfredo Cesar, another leader of the U.S.-supported rebels, saidthe nine points in the agreement ``are not solely an opportunity toachieve peace and agreement, but the only opportunity.''   The agreement was made ``among Nicaraguans, full of good willand confidence in the future,'' said Cesar, who was among Contraand Sandinista leaders crowded on a makeshift dais.   Neither the State Department nor the White House had anyimmediate comment on the agreement, which calls for the estimated10,000 rebels to move into specified zones in Nicaragua during thefirst 15 days of April. Delegations from both sides will return toSapoa on Monday to determine the zones.   The Contras also agreed to accept only humanitarian aid from aneutral organization. This would rule out further military aid fromthe United States, which President Reagan has tried in vain tosecure from Congress. U.S. aid ended Feb. 29 and a successfulSandinista military offensive ensued.   Under the agreement, the Sandinistas will on Sunday release 100Contra prisoners and free half the remaining 1,400 such prisonerswhen Contra fighters have moved into the designated zones. Theremaining 700 Contra prisoners will be freed when a permanent truceis in place.   The 1,800 former National Guardsmen in prison since theSandinistas overthrew the late President Anastasio Somoza in July1979 will be released after a final truce is worked out. UnderSomoza, the army was called the National Guard.   The agreement says the Sandinista government will guaranteefreedom of expression without restrictions, in accordance with aregional peace plan signed last August by Ortega and the presidentsof four other Central American countries.   Many press liberties were barred in Nicaragua for almost sixyears under a state-of-emergency decree that has since been lifted.   The agreement says the Sandinista government will grant gradualamnesty and allow all political exiles to return to the countrywithout fear of persecution and be able to participate in thepolitical process.   The government also agreed to discuss the issue of militaryservice in a national dialogue with the internal politicalopposition. The Contras had sought a suspension of conscription.   In Managua, opposition leaders hailed the agreement.   Eric Ramirez, president of the Social Christian Party, said,``It is a positive effort. Hopefully, it will contribute to endingthe war and to the rise of the democratization of Nicaragua.''   Gustavo Tablada of the Socialist Party called the move ``ahistoric step ... a serious and responsible compromise.''   The agreement was signed by Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defenseminister and head of the Sandinista delegation, and Calero. Alsosigning were Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of theOrganization of American States, and Cardinal Miguel Obando yBravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Managua.   The secretary-general and cardinal attended the talks aswitnesses.   The meeting at Sapoa was the first time the Sandinistas andContras had met on Nicaraguan soil.</TEXT></DOC>
