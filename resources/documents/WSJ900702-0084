Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B6</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill that wouldguarantee workers leave from their jobs of as much as 12weeks a year for childbirth, adoption or serious familyillnesses.   Mr. Bush, whose veto was expected, said he opposes thelegislation because of its &quot;rigid, federally imposedrequirements.&quot; Noting that U.S. companies face their&quot;stiffest competition in history,&quot; he said employers needflexibility in offering benefits to workers.</LP><TEXT>   The veto was the president's 13th since he took office,and is likely to be sustained by Congress, as were hisprevious 12 vetoes. But Democrats seem certain to seize onthe veto as a campaign issue. They noted that Mr. Bushpledged in his 1988 election campaign to protect women'sjobs, though he didn't specify whether he favored any federalfamily-leave requirement.   &quot;No working mother should be forced to choose between thechild she loves and the job she needs,&quot; Sen. Edward Kennedy(D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, said.&quot;The president might as well try to veto motherhood.&quot;   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the measure's chiefsponsor, has said the Senate, which approved the bill by avoice vote earlier last month, is within two or three votesof the necessary two-thirds margin to override the veto. Butin the House, &quot;It's going to be a tough road&quot; to win enoughsupport for an override, said an aide to Rep. Curt Weldon(R., Pa.), a leading House sponsor of the bill. The Housepassed the bill in May by a 237-187 margin, 50 votes short ofoverride strength.   &quot;I do not want Republicans to be blamed for killing theFamily and Medical Leave Act,&quot; Mr. Weldon said of the bill.   Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, another Republican whobacked the bill, said in an interview that she was &quot;stunnedand dismayed&quot; by the speed of the veto of a bill offering a&quot;minimum job benefit,&quot; and noted that Mr. Bush declined tomeet with some GOP members of Congress on the issue. Thepresident &quot;has signed mandates before,&quot; she said. &quot;I don'tknow why he has a blind spot on this one.&quot;   While women's and family-oriented organizations decriedthe veto, business groups applauded it.   &quot;Mandated parental leave is not only an anti-businessidea, but . . . it discriminates against those unable to takeadvantage of the leave, discriminates against those forced onovertime because of its requirements, and discriminatesagainst those who would prefer other fringe benefits, whichwould be eliminated if this measure were enacted,&quot; said JohnSloan, president of the National Federation of IndependentBusiness, a small-business group.</TEXT></DOC>
