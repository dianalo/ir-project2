The direction provided in FSM 1920 provides broad planningdirection for line and primary staff officers and establishes specificresponsibility for perparing regional guides and forest plans and implementing,monitoring, and changing forest plans. Forest Service Handbook 1909.12provides detailed procedural direction and technical guidance for carryingout the direction contained in the law, regulations, and the Forest ServiceManual.The major changes being issued to FSM 1920 related to: requiring a monitoringplan and responds to identified issues and legal requirements; reservingauthority to the Chief to approve the schedule for forest plan revision;and establishing specifications for interim management direction for managementof recommended wilderness and wild and scenic river candidates.The most significant changes being made are for forest plan implementationand amenment. Interim Directive No. 15 to Forest Service Manual 1920 datedFebraury 8, 1988, originally published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> January 13, 1986 (15 FR 1476) is incorporatedin this amendment. The Interim Directive (ID) focuses on forest plan amendmentand revision. It reserves authority to the Chief to approve the schedulefor forest plan revision and establishes Regional Forester responsibilityto review and approve significant amendments to a forest plan. It alsoclarifies the distinction between significant and nonsignificant amendmentsof a forest plan. Comments requested and received in early 1986 followingpublication of the ID have been used in amending applicable parts of Chapter1920. Twelve letters were received in response to our request for comments:three from the Forest Service; two from the timber industry; two from theoil industry; two from environmental groups; one from an inter-tribal fishcommission; one from a State forester; and one from an individual.Most respondents stated a need to clarify criteria for distinguishing betweenplan amendment and plan revision. In response, the Agency has expandedto seven the possible reasons for amending a forest plan (FSM 1922.5).Requirements for forest plan revision were unchanged because of the time-certaincharacteristics of revision. These requirements have been incorporatedat FSM 1922.6Most respondents felt there was a need to determine whether a forest planamendment is either significant or not significant. We agree and have addeddirection for making this determination at FSM 1922.5 and 1922.52. Additionalfactors related to significance of amendments, namely timing, location,size of change, goals, objectives, outputs, and the scope of changed managementprescriptions are addressed in the Handbook at section 5.32. In both theManual and Handbook, the langauge addresses the significance of the changerather than the significance of the amendment to more closely follow thewording in 36 CFR 219.10(f).Most respondents indicated the need to define procedural steps for amendingand revising forest plans. Basic direction for preparing, amending, andrevising forest plans is found in the planning regulations at 36 CFR Part219. Procedures for amending forest plans have been added to sections 5.32and 5.4 of FSH 1909.12. The process is specific for either a nonsignificantor significant change to the forest plan with a different process and approvalrequired for each. The procedures to revise a forest plan are the sameas for preparing a new plan and are found throughout the planning regulations,Chapter 1920 of the Manual, and in the Planning Handbook.Chapters 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9 of Forest Service Handbook 1909.12 were issuedin July 1987. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 are now being added to complete theHandbook. Chapter 3 describes the forest planning process and elaborateson the steps involved in developing a forest land and resource managementplan. Chapter 4 provides outlines to be used in preparing and documentingdraft and final environmental impact statements, proposed and final forestplans, and the record of decision. Chapter 5 sets forth the process forforest plan implementation, including the process required to amend theplan. Chapter 6 provides guidance on monitoring levels, monitoring requirements,and the evaluation of monitoring results. Interested persons should reviewthe entire Handbook to fully understand the forest land and resource managementplanning process. Copies of the Handbook are available for review at allNational Forests and Forest Service Regional offices.The text of the final policy contained in Chapter 1920 of the Forest ServiceManual and Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Forest Service Handbook 1909.12,the Land and Resource Management Planning Handbook, is set forth at theconclusion of this document as it will appear in the Agency's directivesystem.If analysis of comments received on the chapters indicates a need to furtheramend the direction, the Agency will give notice of the proposed revisionsin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and request further comments on the Manual andHandbook.<ITAG tagnum="20">Date: July 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George M. Leonard,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Associate Chief, Forest Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Title 1900_Planning</ITAG>Chapter 1920_Land and Resource Management PlanningThis chapter provides for an integrated land and resource management planningeffort at both the regional and local levels. The planning process determinesavailability of land for resource management, predicts levels of resourceuse and output, and provides direction for management of a variety of resourcemanagement practices.<T3>1920.1_Authority. </T3>Planning for the management and use of the NationalForest System must conform to the requirements of the Forest and RangelandRenewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (RPA) as amended by the NationalForest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), implementing regulations found in36 CFR Part 219, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and implementingregulations found in 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508. See FSM 1901 for a summaryof the Acts, FSM 1013 for the text of 36 CFR Part 219, and FSH 1909.15for Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA.<T3>1920.2_Objectives. </T3>The objectives of land and resource managementplanning are:1. To determine the capability of a planning area to supply goods and servicesin an environmentally sound manner.2. To determine the most cost-efficient method of supplying goods and servicesfrom a planning area to maximize net public benefits in response to society'sdemand.3. To develop a fully integrated plan for management of the land and resourceswithin a planning area.4. To display short- and long-term management intent to the public, Federal,State, and local governments, and industrial and other users.5. To serve as a source of information in developing the RPA Assessmentand Program and to provide the means for implementing the National ForestSystem portion of the Renewable Resources Program (FSM 1910).<T3>1920.3_Policy.</T3> The general policy governing Forest Service planningis found in FSM 1903. Specific principles that apply to land and resourcemanagement planning are found in 36 CFR 219.1. In addition, the followingpolicies apply to regional and forest planning processes:1. Prepare and maintain a work plan to guide and manage the planning process.2. Determine and display the most cost efficient method for meeting thegoals and objectives of any alternative developed in the planning process.3. Obtain the most current data available through use of efficient, compatible,and timely resource inventories. National standards, definitions, and specificationsfor resource inventories are found in specific Forest Service Handbooksthat contain data requirements, resource measurements, and inventory planningand implementation instructions. Coordinate inventories to reduce duplicationof data collection at all planning levels.4. Use FSH 1309.16, the National Activity Structure Handbook, to identify,code, and define outputs and management practices (activities) used inthe planning process.5. Organize planning records and make them available for public reviewwhen the draft environmental impact statement is filed.6. Use the management review system as the primary process to ensure evaluationand documentation of the results of forest plan monitoring are accomplished.7. Display planning data and information in a manner that can be easilyunderstood by users and the public.Regional guides and forest plans begun prior to issuance of this directionare exempt from the requirements of this chapter until such time as a significantamendment to the regional guide is prepared or, for forest plans, untilthe next scheduled revision.It is the policy of the Chief that all primary direction necessary fordevelopment of regional guides and forest plans be contained in this chapter,or supplements or handbooks thereto.<T3>1920.4_Responsibility. </T3>General responsibilities for planning arefound in 36 CFR Part 219 and in FSM 1904.

The Director of Land ManagementPlanning chairs the group.<T3>1921.1_Regional Planning Process.</T3><T3>1921.11_Results of Regional Planning. </T3>Regional planning resultsin:1. An analysis of a region's management situation, including an assessmentof current and future supply capability, demand projections for goods andservices, and an assessment of public issues and management concerns withinthe region. Management concerns include achievement of goals and objectivesassigned by the Chief.2. An identification and analysis of the need to adopt new or change existingstandards and guidelines.3. New or revised planning and/or resource direction to forests.4. The region's input and response to RPA alternatives.5. The assignement of RPA Program targets to forests.Document these analyses and findings in the regional guide (FSM 1921.2).<T3>1921.12_Formulation of Alternatives.</T3> Develop a full range of alternativestandards and guidelines, including those specified in 36 CFR 219.9(a)(5),in accordance with CEQ regulations 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508 implementingNEPA. The range of alternatives to be examined depends upon the publicissues, management concerns, and resource opportunities identified throughanalysis of the management situation.<T3>1921.13_Estimated Effects of Alternatives.</T3> Document the estimatedeffects for each alternative. If sound data are not available, use anddocument the best professional judgment available. Environmental consequencesof implementing the alternatives are documented in the environmental impactstatement accompanying the regional guide.<T3>1921.14_Evaluation of Alternatives.</T3> The evaluation of alternativesreflects the net overall physical, biological, economic, and social changesexpected with implementation of each alternative. The Regional Forester,with the concurrence of the Chief, shall designate as the preferred alternativethe alternative that best addresses major regional issues and managementconcerns.<T3>1921.2_Regional Guide Content.</T3> The regional guide contains thoseelements specified in 36 CFR 219.9. The guide and environmental impactstatement document the analysis required by FSM 1921.11.<T3>1921.3_Review and Approval of Regional Guides.</T3><T3>1921.31_Internal Review.</T3> Regional Foresters shall submit draftand final regional guides and accompanying environmental impact statementsto the Chief for review by both the Technical Review Group and the PlanningCoordination Group prior to Chief's approval for regional publication.<T3>1921.32_External Review.</T3> See 36 CFR 219.8(c) for direction onexternal review of draft and final regional guides and accompanying environmentalimpact statements.<T3>1921.33_Amendments.</T3> See 36 CFR 219.8(f) for the process to amendregional guides. In addition, the Regional Forester:1. Approves all nonsignificant amendments to a regional guide.2. Documents approval and determination of nonsignificance in writing.3. Forwards copies of nonsignificant amendments to interested and affectedpublics and to all Forest Service offices that have copies of the regionalguide on file.4. Determines, upon completion of each RPA Program update, whether an amendmentto the regional guide is necessary when the regional share of the RPA Program,regional conditions, or the demands of the public in the region have changedsignificantly.<T3>1921.4_Planning Records.</T3> Planning records documenting the regionalplanning process must meet the requirements of 36 CFR 219.8(g).<T3>1922_FOREST PLANNING.</T3> Planning for units of the National ForestSystem involves two levels of decisions. The first is development of aforest plan that provides direction for all resource management programs,practices, uses, and protection measures. The forest plan consists of bothforest-wide and area specific standards and guidelines that provide forland uses with anticipated resource outputs under the given set of managementconstraints. The outputs are not hard and fast decisions within the plansince all conditions required to produce outputs, such as annual budgetappropriations, are not controlled by the unit. The second level planninginvolves the analysis and implementation of management practices designedto achieve the goals and objectives of the forest plan. This level involvessite-specific analysis to meet NEPA requirements for decisionmaking.<T3>1922.03_Policy.</T3> In addition to complying with the general policiesand principles set forth in FSM 1920.3, the forest planning process must:1. Integrate all resource programs and supporting activities.2. Base resource inventories on sound sampling designs using common definitionsand standards.3. Use FORPLAN as the primary analysis tool to schedule outputs and activitiesin the management areas.4. Use present net value as the indicator of cost efficiency in each alternative(See FSM 1970 and FSH 1909.17).5. Use economic, social, and other environmental analyses to evaluate anddisplay differences associated with producing alternative levels of thevarious renewable resources.6. Evaluate and display the compatibility and conflict between resourcevalues.7. Document and display the economic and social effects and physical andbiological conditions anticipated with implementation of each alternativeas well as the differences between alternatives.8. Systematically construct, analyze, and display the rationale, resourceimplications, and effects of management standards on present net valueand potential production of significant resources.9. Estimate the goods and services, activities, and investments to be implementedor produced by decade and display these outputs for the identified RPAtime periods.10. Prepare a monitoring plan that is responsive to identified issues andsufficient to meet legal requirements for monitoring soil, water, air,wildlife and fish, vegetation, and other resources.<T3>1922.04_Responsibility.</T3> The Chief reserves the authority to approvethe schedule for revising individual forest plans.<T3>1922.04a_Regional Forester.</T3> In addition to the responsibilitiesspecified in FSM 1904 and 36 CFR 219.10(a), each Regional Forester shall:1. Coordinate planning efforts between forests within the region and betweenregions where forests adjoin.2. Maintain quality control of forest plans by ensuring that forest plansmeet the standards of FSM 1922.21.3. Ensure forest plan monitoring standards are consistent among adjoiningunits.4. Review, and approve as appropriate, any amendment that results in asignificant change to a forest plan.5. Propose to the Chief a schedule for revising forest plans.<T3>1922.04b_Forest Supervisor. </T3>In addition to the responsibilitiesspecified in FSM 1904 and 36 CFR 219.10(a), each Forest Supervisor shall:1. Prepare the draft and final forest plan and environmental impact statementto meet the standards in FSM 1922.21 and 1922.31a.2. Ensure that the interdisciplinary team integrates knowledge of the physical,biological, economic and social sciences, and environmental design artsin the planning process.3. Conduct planning activities in a manner fully consistent with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Council on Environmental Quality implementingregulations, the Forest Service's environmental policies and proceduresdescribed in FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15, and the requirements of 36 CFR 219.5.4. Develop and approve amendments that result in a nonsignificant changeto the forest plan.5. Prepare amendments that result in a significant change to the forestplan and recommend them to the Regional Forester for approval.6. Propose revision of the forest plan to meet the requirements of 36 CFR219.10(g) and when directed by the Chief.<T3>1922.1_Forest Planning Process. </T3>The framework for forest planningis a set of 10 actions described in 36 CFR 219.12 (b) through (k). Allthe actions are interdependent but some may occur simultaneously. Of necessity,the process is open-ended, dynamic, and interactive.<T3>1922.11_Forest Planning Results. </T3>Minimum result required of forestplanning are:1. Identification of resource management issues and concerns and managementopportunities.2. Development of a set of criteria to guide the formulation and evaluationof alternatives (36 CFR 219.12(c)).3. Analysis of the management situation including all items required in36 CFR 219.12(e). The analysis determines both the need for and the opportunityto establish or change management direction.4. Formulation of a set of alternatives that reflects a wide range of optionsresponsive to the significant issues described through benchmark analysis(FSM 1922.12).5. Evaluation of alternatives and identification of a preferred alternativein accordance with NEPA, CEQ regulations, and Forest Service environmentalpolicies and procedures (FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15).6. A forest plan that achieves the 14 principles described in 36 CFR 219.1.7. A monitoring program to evaluate progress toward achieving the goals,objectives, and standards of the plan and the validity of assumptions andcoefficients used to estimate outputs and effects.<T3>1922.12_Benchmark Analysis. </T3>Benchmark analysis provides baselinedata necessary to formulate and analyze alternatives. Benchmarks estimatea forest's physical, biological, and technical capabilities to producegoods and services. The development of benchmarks is not limited by ForestService policy or budget, discretionary constraints, or program and staffingrequirements. To carry out the requirements of 36 CFR 219.12(e)(1), allforests shall develop and analyze the following benchmarks:1. Minimum level management.2. Maximum present net value based on established market price.3. Maximum present net value including assigned values.4. Current level management.5. Maximum resource levels. (Where appropriate, develop individual benchmarksthat estimate the maximum capability of the unit to provide significantresource emphasis levels.)6. Maximum wilderness.7. Maximum nonwilderness.Ensure that analysis of wilderness and nonwilderness benchmarks is consistentwith wilderness legislation passed for individual States.<T3>1922.13_Formulation of Alternatives. </T3>Formulate alternatives tomeet the requirements of 36 CFR 219.12(f) and 219.16. Forests must, asa minimum, formulate:1. An alternative that represents the current program (no action).2. An alternative that emphasizes market opportunities.3. An alternative that emphasizes nonmarket opportunities.4. An alternative that emphasizes meeting RPA Program outputs assignedby the regional guide.5. Other alternatives necessary to respond to the full range of publicissues, management concerns, and resource use and development opportunities.6. A preferred alternative resulting from the analysis and evaluation requiredby 36 CFR 219.12 (g) and (h).<T3>1922.14_Estimated Effects of Alternatives. </T3>The estimated effectsof alternatives provide an objective, scientific, and analytic basis forcomparing the alternatives (36 CFR 219.12(g)). The analysis and comparisonmust be sufficient to permit an informed selection of the preferred alternativeas described above.<T3>1922.155_Resource Integration Requirements. </T3>Requirements for integratingindividual forest resources including wilderness and other special areasinto the forest planning process are found in 36 CFR 219.14 through 219.27.Refer to current Service-wide Handbooks for more specific detail on howto incorporate resources. In addition, the forest planning process must:1. Provide management direction for wilderness, wild and scenic rivers,national recreation areas, national trails, national monuments, nationalscenic areas, research natural areas, national management emphasis areas,and other identified special, interest areas.2. Use the recreation opportunity spectrum (ROS) system to determine managementof recreation settings, opportunities, and to provide a broad spectrumof experiences in response to user preference.3. Determine the silvicultural systems and practices to be applied to suitablelands.4. Provide for management of land suitable for timber production for sawtimber-sizecrop trees unless exceptions such as pulpwood crop trees are provided forin the forest plan. Also, provide for management of suitable forest landto provide multiple products including, but not limited to, sawlogs, pulpwood,poles, posts, and fuelwood through appropriate silvicultural practicesto utilize site productivity.5. Determine output levels for fuelwood and other nonindustrial wood productsthat do not require secondary processing where sustained demand is anticipated.6. In addition to the requirements and conditions for a departure fromthe base sale schedule of 36 CFR 219.16(a)(3), analyze a departure in atleast one alternative presented in detail in the EIS for appropriate foreststo include the Clearwater, Idaho Panhandle, Nezperce, Boise, Payette, Lassen,Shasta-Trinity, Six Rivers, and all National Forests in Region 6. Treatthe departure alternative as a discrete alternative; however, it must belinked to an alternative with a base sale schedule exhibiting nondecliningflow.7. Permit a departure sale schedule to temporarily drop below the basetimber sale schedule at or beyond the end of the first decade.8. For those alternatives where the base timber sale schedule in the firstdecade equals the long-term sustained-yield capacity, evaluate the possibilityof departing and subsequently dropping down to, but not below, the basesale schedule at any time in the future.9. Meet the intent of the culmination of mean annual increment (CMAI) requirementby ensuring the total yield from stands at harvest age is equal to or greaterthan 95 percent of the volume production corresponding to CMAI. Base CMAIon cubic measure and on the yield from regeneration harvests and any additionalyields resulting from intermediate harvests.10. Determine the annual net growth on lands suitable for timber productionfor the year 2030 for at least the preferred alternative. If in the preferredalternative, the net growth at 2030 is less than 90% of the long-term sustained-yieldcapacity for that alternative, describe the additional actions and costsalong with the resulting benefits and environmental effects to achievethis level.11. Use cubic foot volume and harvest acres, by harvest method, as a dualcontrol in regulating the amount of timber to be offered and sold as specifiedby the allowable timber sale quantity. Base the control for treatment practicessuch as site preparation, reforestation, and precommercial thinning onacreage measurements.12. Develop a timber sale schedule (See 42.7 of FSH 2409.13) and displayin the forest plan. The schedule should include timber sales for at leastthe first 3 to 5 years, and preferably for the 10 year period; the locationof specific sales by section, township, and range or other appropriatedesignations; the area and volume in each sale; and the miles of road tobe constructed or reconstructed for each sale.13. Ensure that the set of management indicator species includes RPA andregional wildlife and fish indicators and represents all significant forestlevel wildlife and fish diversity and resource production issues, concerns,and opportunities.14. Ensure that management prescriptions will provide for habitat capabilityto meet demand for management indicator species and provide access forrecreational and commercial uses with minimal disturbance to species useof suitable habitats.15. Ensure that planned management prevents the need for Federal or Statelisting of additional plant or animal species.16. Ensure the plan provides for the kinds, amounts, and distribution ofhabitat needed for recovery of threatened or endangered species and neededto maintain viable, well-distributed populations of all existing nativeand desired non-native species.17. Plan for wildfire protection and prescribed fire use appropriate toefficient attainment of land management goals and objectives. Use the NationalFire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) to develop and evaluate potentialprotection alternatives.18. Identify the desired landownership pattern and develop guidelines forlandownership adjustments to include purchase, donations, exchange, right-of-wayacquisition, transfers, interchanges, sales, and boundary adjustments.Guidelines for landownership adjustments should emphasize the followingobjectives:a. Acquisition to meet identified resource management needs.b. Acquisition contributing to consolidation that reduces administrativeproblems and costs and further enhances public use.c. Conveyance of land better suited for non-federal ownership.19. Provide access to energy and mineral resources in the most efficientmanner and encourage industry proposals for resource development on NationalForest System lands, consistent with the rights that individuals or companieshave acquired under the mineral leasing acts and mining laws and consistentwith the objective of the alternatives.20. Identify the specific access requirements and travel management optionsavailable to meet the objectives for each management prescription. Describehow access will be provided and how travel will be managed. Include theforest development road system, off-road travel, and air and water access.Integrate considerations of biological, physical, social, and economicfactors and environmental design criteria. Link access and travel requirementsand opportunities to the full spectrum of resource objectives for eachmanagement area and alternative.21. Plan for the development and maintenance of other physical supportfacilities required to carry out management objectives.22. Provide for consideration of transportation and utility corridor designationand utilization as specified in the regional guide (36 CFR 219.9(a)(5)(iv)).Coordinate activities between Regions and with other Federal and Stateagencies to designate location, alignment, and associated use and occupancystandards for rights-of-way.23. Determine watershed condition class and include objectives or prescriptionsfor improving watershed conditions when necessary.24. Insure municipal watershed requirements (36 CFR 251.9) are incorporatedin forest plan standards and guidelines.25. Identify groundwater aquifers and provide management direction fortheir protection.26. Provide management direction to protect air quality related values,including visibility, in Class I Federal areas as required by the CleanAir Act Amendments of 1977 and FSM 2120.<T3>1922.2_Forest Plan Content. </T3>36 CFR 219.11 establishes minimumrequirements for content of the forest plan.<T3>1922.21_Standards for Forest Plans. </T3>In addition to the other requirementsof this chapter and 36 CFR Part 219, forest plans must meet the followingstandards:1. Resource information and other data are factual and accurate.2. Direction is adequate to guide formulation of individual resource programsand schedules needed to implement the plan.3. Assumptions, analytical approaches, and data are consistently appliedwithin the plan.4. Interdisciplinary planning and resource coordination are clearly evident.5. A map delineating management areas and designating future corridorsis included.<T3>1922.3_Review and Approval of Forest Plans. </T3>36 CFR 219.10 establishesgeneral requirements for review and approval of forest plans.<T3>1922.31_Internal Review. </T3>The Regional Forester reviews forestplans against the standards in section 1922.21.<T3>1922.31a_Standards for Regional Review. </T3>Regional review shallensure that:1. Each forest plan complies with laws, regulations, policy, the regionalguide, and Chief's direction.2. Each forest plan is reviewed against RPA targets and related costs forthe forest and the region as a whole.3. The range of alternatives in each forest plan is reviewed against maximumresource and economic efficiency capabilities. Ensure the alternativespresented adequately span the identified, feasible range.4. The analysis and comparative evaluation, documented in the environmentalimpact statement, is adequate to permit an informed selection of the preferredalternative.5. The completed forest plan and environmental impact statement have receivedan interdisciplinary review.<T3>1922.31b_Internal Review Process</T3>1. The Regional Forester approves and forwards the draft proposed planand environmental impact statement to the Washington Office Land ManagementPlanning (LMP) Staff. The LMP Staff review, coordinated with other WashingtonOffice staffs, focuses on the forum, content, and the ability of thesedocuments to meet national standards for the planning process.2. Following Washington Office technical review and final approval by theRegional Forester, the forest prints and draft forest plan and accompanyingenvironmental impact statement and makes them available for public review.3. The Regional Forester reviews a summary of the public comment receivedon the draft, the forest's response to the comment, and the proposed finalforest plan and final environmental impact statement.4. The Chief requires Washington Office review and approval prior to printingof all final plans and their accompanying environmental impact statement,if the plan makes recommendations that ultimately will require Congressionalaction such as additions to or deletions from the National Wilderness PreservationSystem, National Trails, National Recreation Areas, studies or changesto the National Wild and Scenic River System, and proposed adjustmentsin National Forest boundaries. Otherwise, upon approval of final forestplans by the Regional Forester, the forest may print and release the finaldocuments unless:a. The Region has specifically requested additional Washington Office review.b. The Chief has specified additional Washington Office review becauseof the degree or intensity of controversy, the extent of changes in thepreferred or any other alternative, or if other circumstances warrant.<T3>1922.32_External Review. </T3>External reviews during the forest planningprocess require public participation and coordination with other publicplanning efforts (36 CFR 219.6, 219.7, 219.10, and 40 CFR 1502.9 and 1503).Plan public participation at the earliest stages of the process. Obtainpublic participation in the identification of public issues during theformal scoping process and during review of draft documents. Prepare apublic participation plan and make this plan a part of the planning recordsalong with documented results of participation activities. Document resultsof coordination with other Federal agencies, State and local governments,and Indian tribes.<T3>1922.4_Forest Plan Implementation. </T3>Detailed instructions for implementationof forest plans are found in Chapter 5 of the Land and Resource ManagementPlanning Handbook, FSH 1909.12.<T3>1922.41_Analysis and Evaluation. </T3>Conduct analysis and evaluationto establish a rational basis for making decisions on proposed managementpractices or actions. The analysis must provide the responsible officialwith relevant information necessary to make a decision to select or rejectproposed management practices or actions. The information must be sufficientto establish a determination of consistency, comply with NEPA requirements,document findings, and provide a basis for selecting actions to implement.The following provides specific requirements for analysis and evaluation:1. Confirm and document that the proposed management decisions are consistentwith the management direction in the forest plan. Management practicesshould be consistent with the forest plan before they can be selected forimplementation. If an action cannot be changed to be consistent, the actionmust be rejected or the forest plan must be amended as directed in FSM1922.5. Consistency determinations, including specific required findings,are described in Chapter 5.3 of FSH 1909.12.2. Normally, base economic analysis of proposed management practices oncost effectiveness (least cost analysis). Use cost-efficiency analysis(FSM 1970) where costs or consequences are in question or where cost-efficiencywas not adequately evaluated in the forest plan. Select actions that reducethe overall cost while meeting forest plan direction; and3. Conduct analysis of management practices and alternatives in a mannerthat allows evaluation or the interconnected actions necesssary to achievethe integrated resource objectives envisioned by the forest plan.4. Conduct environmental analysis as necessary to determine direct, indirect,and cumulative effects of various actions proposed within a given area.Analyze cumulative effects when thresholds such as the hydrologic capacityof a watershed, visual quality standards, or wildlife or fisheries habitatmay be exceeded; 5. Complete environmental analysis before deciding upon an action (FSM1952 and FSH 1909.15, Chapter 20); <T3>1922.42_Selected Management Practices. </T3>Upon completion of analysis,the responsible official decides which management practices to select toachieve forest plan direction. Develop an implementation schedule for theseselected management practices. Management practices not identified in theimplementation schedule may be considered, but the forest plan may requireamendment. <T3>1922.5_Amendment. </T3>The need to amend a forest plan may arise fromseveral sources, including the following: 1. Recommendations of the Forest interdisciplinary team based on findingsthat result from monitoring and evaluating implementation of the forestplan (36 CFR 219.12(k) and FSM 1922.7); 2. Findings that existing or proposed permits, contracts, cooperative agreements,and other instruments authorizing occupancy and use are not consistentwith the forest plan but should be approved (36 CFR 219.10(e)); 3. Changes in proposed implementation schedules (36 CFR 219.10(e)) necessaryto reflect differences between funding levels contemplated in the forestplan and funds actually appropriated; 4. Changes necessitated by resolution of administrative appeals; 5. Changes to correct planning errors; 6. Changes necessitated by changed physical, social, or economic conditions;and 7. Implementation of management practices outside the scope of the forestplan. Upon receiving advice of the interdisciplinary team that the plan requireschange, the responsible official shall: 1. Determine whether proposed changes to a forest plan are significantor not significant in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR 219.10(e) and (f), 36 CFR 219.12(k), and sections 1922.51 and 1922.52 that follow;2. Document the determination of whether the change is significant or notsignificant in a decision document; and 3. Provide appropriate public notification of the decision prior to implementingthe changes. Findings of the responsible official regarding the consistency of managementpractices and actions with the forest plan and the determination of thesignificance of an amendment are an integral part of decisions. As such,they are appealable. <T3>1922.51_Changes to the Forest Plan That Are Not Significant. </T3>Changesto the forest plan that are not significant can result from: 1. Actions that do not significantly alter the multiple-use goals and objectivesfor long-term land and resource management; 2. Adjustments of management area boundaries or management prescriptionsresulting from further on-site analysis when the adjustments do not causesignificant changes in the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-termland and resource management; and 3. Minor changes in standards and guidelines. 4. Opportunities for additional management practices that will contributeto achievement of the management prescription. The Forest Supervisor must prepare an amendment to the forest plan to accommodatea change determined not to be significant. Appropriate public notificationis required prior to implementation of the amendment. <T3>1922.52_Changes to the Forest Plan That Are Significant. </T3>The followingexamples are indicative of circumstances that may cause a significant changeto a forest plan:1. Changes that would significantly alter the long-term relationship betweenlevels of multiple-use goods and services originally projected (36 CFR219.10(e)); and 2. Changes that may have an important effect on the entire forest planor affect land and resources throughout a large portion of the planningarea during the planning period. When a significant change needs to be made to the forest plan, the ForestSupervisor must prepare an amendment. Documentation of a significant change, including the necessary analysisand evaluation should focus on the issues that have triggered the needfor the change. In developing and obtaining approval of the amendment forsignificant change to the forest plan, follow the same procedures as arerequired for developing and approving the forest plan (36 CFR 219.10(f)and 36 CFR 219.12).<T3>1922.6_Revision. </T3>The National Forest Management Act requires revisionof forest plans at least every 15 years; however, a plan may be revisedsooner if physical conditions or demands on the land and resources havechanged sufficiently to affect overall goals or uses for the entire forest.To revise a forest plan, follow procedures set forth in 36 CFR 219.12 afterobtaining approval of the Chief to schedule a revision. <T3>1922.7_Monitoring and Evaluation. </T3>Conduct monitoring of the forestland and resource management plan and of the individual management practices,to determine how well objectives have been met and how closely managementstandards and guidelines have been applied. Monitoring and evaluation requirementsfor the forest plan are found at 36 CFR 219.12(k). See Chapter 6, FSH 1909.12for an explanation of monitoring and evaluation of forest plans. 1. Monitoring of the forest plan is conducted at three levels: a. Implementation Monitoring. Implementation monitoring determines if plans,prescriptions, projects, and activities are implemented as designed andin compliance with forest plan objectives, requirements, and standardsand guidelines. Evaluation of implementation monitoring may require adjustmentof prescriptions and targets or changes in plan or project administration.b. Effectiveness Monitoring. Effectiveness monitoring determines if plans,prescriptions, projects, and activities are effective in meeting managementdirection, objectives, and the standards and guidelines. Evaluation ofthe results of effectiveness monitoring is used to adjust forest plan objectives,targets, prescriptions, standards and guidelines, conservation practices,mitigation measures, and other best management practices and could resultin change to or amendment of the forest plan. c. Validating Monitoring. Validation monitoring is designed to ascertainwhether the initial assumptions and coefficients used in development ofthe forest plan are correct or if there is a better way to meet forestplanning regulations, policies, goals, and objectives. Evaluation of thistype of monitoring can result in amendment of forest plans and may be usedto recommend changes in laws, regulations, and policies that affect boththe plan and project implementation. <T3>1922.71_Monitoring Requirements.</T3> 1. Focus monitoring on those activities that affect significant managementsystems such as total silvicultural systems and other monitoring requirementsof the regional guide; those activities that are responsive to stated issues,concerns, and management opportunities; and those activities that affectmajor components of the environment. 2. Coordinate monitoring efforts with resource inventory needs to reduceduplication. 3. Monitor to ensure that: a. The forest plan complies with applicable laws and regulations. b. Cumulative effects of project implementation do not exceed standardsor thresholds stated in the forest plan. c. Planned mitigation actions are implemented and maintained as designed.d. Local, state, and federal air, water, noise, and other legal requirementsare met. <T3>1923_Wilderness Evaluation. </T3>Consideration of wilderness suitabilityis inherent in land and resource management planning. Although the Presidentand the Secretary may recommend that certain areas be designated wilderness,Congress reserves the authority to designate areas as wilderness. In addition,the Congess may direct the study of specific areas and provide other guidanceon wilderness evaluations through specific wilderness legislation. Planningfor potential wilderness designation may occur in development of a forestplan or may require a separate study. <T3>1923.01_Authority. </T3>Specific authority for the study and designationof wilderness is contained in the Wilderness Act of September 3, 1964,and the Eastern Wilderness Act of January 3, 1975. <T3>1923.03_Policy.</T3> 1. Specific policies governing identification and evaluation of roadlessareas in the forest planning process are found in 36 CFR 219.17 and Chapter7 of FSH 1909.12. 2. A roadless area being evaluated and ultimately recommended for wildernessor wilderness study is not available for any use or activity that my reducethe area's wilderness potential. Activities currently permitted may continue,pending designation, if the activities do not compromise wilderness valuesof the roadless area. <T3>1923.04_Responsibility.</T3> <T3>1923.04a_Chief. </T3>The Chief reserves authority to: 1. Review the final environmental impact statement when wilderness is recommendedas a part of the forest planning process. 2. Recommend wilderness proposals to the Secretary. <T3>1923.04b_Regional Forester. </T3>The Regional Forester is assignedresponsibility to: 1. Review, recommend approval of, and forward to the Chief, final wildernessstudy reports for all Congressionally mandated wilderness studies and allother studies that recommend that wilderness be designated or that recommendCongressional wilderness study designation for areas east of the 100thmeridian. 2. Approve final management direction for designated wildeness as providedin 36 CFR 219.18. <T3>1923.04c_Forest Supervisor. </T3>The Forest Supervisor shall conductnecessary wilderness studies and prepare a study report/environmental impactstatement, either as a part of the forest plan or as a separate study.<T3>1923.1_Review and Approval. </T3>In addition to the requirements ofthis section, internal review and approval of wilderness recommendationsmust meet the same requirements as for forest plans (FSM 1922.3). <T3>1923.11_Proposals Resulting From Forest Planning. </T3>Prior to printingthe forest plan's final environmental impact statement, the Regional Forestermust notify the Chief by letter of the tentative recommendations on wildernessstudy areas or other roadless areas evaluated during forest planning. Theenvironmental impact statement accompanying the forest plan must be structuredin such a way as to permit ``lifting'' the wilderness recommendation andevaluation from the parent document to become a legislative EIS. The wildernessdocument must meet NEPA requirements and stand on its own.Forest plans and final environmental impact statements that make recommendationsfor wilderness designation must contain the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation is a preliminary administrative recommendationthat will receive further review and possible modification by the Chiefof the Forest Service, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Presidentof the United States. The Congress has reserved the authority to make finaldecisions on wilderness designation. Therefore, this wilderness recommendationis not appealable under the agency's administrative appeal procedures.</ITAG><T3>1923.12_Proposals Resulting From Special Wilderness Studies Not Incorporatedin Forest Plans. </T3>The Regional Forester shall transmit the combinedstudy document and draft environmental impact statement to the Chief forfiling with the Environmental Protection Agency. Special wilderness studiesfollow essentially the same steps through the public review and commentperiod on the environmental impact statement as studies conducted as partof forest planning. Exceptions are made to meet the requirements of legislativelanguage developed by the Congress.<T3>1924_Wild and Scenic River Evaluation. </T3>Consideration of potentialwild and scenic rivers is an inherent part of the ongoing land and resourcemanagement planning process. A river study assesses the eligibility ofa river for designation as a unit of the National Wild and Scenic RiverSystem and evaluates the potential physical, biological, economic, andsocial effects of adding the river to the National System. See Chapter8 of FSH 1909.12 for eligibility criteria and the river study process.The studies form the basis for reports and recommendations to the Presidentand Congress and for legislative action regarding a river's designation.<T3>1924.01_Authority. </T3>The principle authority for study and designationof wild and scenic rivers is the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of October2, 1968, as amended. The revised USDA-USDI Guidelines for Eligibility,Classification, and Management of River Areas dated September 7, 1982,supplement the Act and provide more specific direction. In addition, theNationwide Rivers Inventory published in January, 1982, by the NationalPark Service identifies some of the potential wild and scenic rivers.<T3>1924.03_Policy.</T3>1. Complete river studies as expeditiously as possible. Give priority tostudying those rivers most threatened by adverse developments and use andthose bordered by the greatest proportion of private lands.2. Conduct studies in close cooperation with affected Federal agenciesand with agencies of the affected State(s) and its political subdivision.The studies include a determination of possible State participation inthe preservation and administration of the river if it is added to theSystem.3. Rivers identified for study are managed to maintain their outstandingvalues. Refer to the USDA-USDI Guidelines for Eligibility, Classification,and Management of River Areas dated September 7, 1982, for specific managementguidance for each of the river classifications and Chapter 8 of FSH 1909.12for additional direction.<T3>1924.04_Responsibility. </T3>The Secretary of Agriculture has designatedthe Forest Service as the lead coordinating agency for the Department inthe studies of rivers that involve National Forest System lands.<T3>1924.04a_Chief. </T3>The Chief reserves the authority to:1. Approving the draft environmental impact statement/study report forCongressionally designated study rivers and to authorize submission ofthe report for interdepartmental and intradepartmental review of the proposalas required in section 4(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.2. Approve the final environmental impact statement/study report for allriver studies and to submit a recommendation for the Secretary of Agriculture'sconsideration.<T3>1924.04b_Deputy Chief for National Forest System. </T3>The Deputy Chiefis responsible for:1. Approve designation of the lead region when a Congressionally designatedstudy river involves more than one region.2. Coordinating the Department's review of other agency and State wildand scenic river proposals that are submitted pursuant to section 2(a)(ii)of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.<T3>1924.04c_Regional Forester. </T3>The Regional Forester:1. Designates the lead forest when a study river involves more than oneNational Forest.2. Invites the concerned State(s) to participate jointly in the study ofpotential wild and scenic rivers where USDA is the lead agency.3. Approves management direction for noncongressionally designated studyrivers that are found eligible during land management planning but awaitcompletion of a suitability analysis.<T3>1924.04d_Forest Supervisor. </T3>The Forest Supervisor:1. Prepares a plan of study for assigned study rivers. The study plan providesfor the completion of all tasks within the time period specified in thelegislation or by other policy.2. Arranges for public meetings to inform the public of the purposes andobjectives of a study and to obtain public views and concerns that shouldbe addressed during a study.3. Assigns an interdisciplinary team to conduct the study. The team shallpossess skills commensurate with the resource values associated with theriver and adjacent lands.4. Prepares the necessary environmental impact statements/study reportseither as part of the forest land management planning process or as requiredfor a Congressionally designated study.5. Ensures that the forest plan contains management direction for riversor segments of rivers that have been recommended for inclusion in the NationalWild and Scenic River System.<T3>1924.1_Report. </T3>The Forest Supervisor must prepare a detailed studyreport to be submitted to the Congress for all Congressionally designatedstudy rivers and those rivers identified through the forest planning processas suitable for wild and scenic river designation. The report describesthe river's eligibility and suitability for designation as a componentof the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.<T3>1924.2_Review and Approval. </T3>FSM 1924.04 prescribes the reviewand approval responsibilities for recommending Congressionally designatedstudy rivers. Review and approval of rivers identified or studied for designationin the course of the forest planning process shall follow the process setforth in FSM 1922.3.<ITAG tagnum="84">Land and Resource Management Planning Handbook</ITAG>Chapter 3_Forest Planning Process<ITAG tagnum="71">Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.1 IDENTIFICATION OF PURPOSE AND NEED</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.2 PREPARATION OF PLANNING CRITERIA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.21 Management Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">33.3 INVENTORY DATA AND INFORMATION COLLECTION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.31 Capability, Analysis, and Management Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.32 Data and FORPLAN Coefficients</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.33 Analytical Tools</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.4 ANALYSIS OF THE MANAGEMENT SITUATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.41 Required Analysis</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.41a Description of Current Management Situation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.41b Benchmark Analysis</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.41c Resource Demand Projections</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.41d Analytical Conclusions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42 Benchmark Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42a Minimum Level Management Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42b Maximum Present Net Value with Assigned Values Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42c Maximum Present Net Value with Market Values Only Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42d Current Level Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42e Maximum Timber Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42f Maximum Range Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42g Maximum Wilderness Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42h Maximum Nonwilderness Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.42i Maximum Present Net Value with Assigned Values_Departure Benchmark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.43 Management Prescriptions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.5 FORMULATION OF ALTERNATIVES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.51 Guiding Principles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.52 Current Direction (No Action) Alternative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.53 Emphasis on Market Opportunities Alternatives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.54 Emphasis on Nonmarket (Amenity) Opportunities Alternative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.55 Emphasis on Meeting Assigned Renewable Resources Program OutputAlternative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.56 Wilderness Emphasis with Capital Investment Emphasis on RemainingLands Alternative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.57 Other Alternatives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.58 Constraints on Alternatives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.6 ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF ALTERNATIVES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.7 EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES AND PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3.8 PLAN APPROVAL</ITAG>This chapter sets forth the minimum procedures for meeting forest planningrequirements in 36 CFR 219.12 and FSM 1922. Subsequent chapters addressdocumentation requirements, procedural requirements for forest plan implementationand amendment, and forest plan monitoring and evaluation. <T3>3.1</T3>_<T3>IDENTIFICATION OF PURPOSE AND NEED. </T3>Forest planning is based onpublic issues, management concerns, and opportunities for resource management.The issue, concerns, and opportunities designated for consideration inthe planning process are used to develop the goals and objectives thatgive purpose to the land and resource management plan. The minimum requirementsfor documenting issues, concerns, and opportunities in the planning recordsare as follows: 1. Keep a dated copy of the initial list of issues and concerns from bothinternal and external sources. 2. Keep a dated copy of criteria used to screen issues, concerns, and opportunities.3. Document the disposition of each issue to indicate how each was evaluatedin the screening process. 4. Describe development of goals and objectives to be used to resolve issuesand concerns. 5. Document the preliminary selection of issues and concerns on which theforest plan is to concentrate. Describe any conflict involved or the competitivenature of the issue or concern and the goals or objectives for resolutionof the issue or concern. <T3>3.2</T3>_<T3>PREPARATION OF PLANNING CRITERIA. </T3>The purpose of preparing planningcriteria is to guide analysis during the planning process. In additionto the requirements of 36 CFR 219.12(c), the following criteria shouldbe applied: 1. Alternatives are technically possible to implement. 2. Alternatives meet management requirements or standards. 3. Various levels of multiple use objectives and outputs are achieved.<T3>3.21</T3>_<T3>Management Requirements. </T3>Minimum specific management requirementsare requirements of law and regulation that must be met while implementingmanagement prescriptions for resource use. Management requirements arespecified in 36 CFR 219.27. Attainment of management requirements shouldimpose the least possible restrictions on the achievement of multiple usegoals and objectives. Management requirements are primarily achieved through application of standardsand guidelines. The standards and guidelines define physical and biologicalconditions that are consistent with the management requirements and specifyhow the conditions are to be met. Estimate opportunity costs of the sets of standards and guidelines thatare proposed to meet management requirements during benchmark analysis.If these standards and guidelines significantly limit achievement of multipleuse goals and objectives, consider alternative standards and guidelinesthat may be less restrictive. Where alternative standards and guidelinesare available, the analysis of the alternatives and the selection and displayof final standards and guidelines is specified in section 4.13(3) of thishandbook. <T3>3.3</T3>_<T3>INVENTORY DATA AND INFORMATION COLLECTION. </T3>Various data are necessaryboth for planning for and managing the National Forest. Collect data forthe forest as a whole and specific to parts of the forest, as appropriate.Coordinate data collection to meet all resource data needs. Document aspart of the planning records the delineation of capability, analysis, andmanagement areas; the criteria used to delineate analysis and managementarea; data sources and coefficients used in the analysis process; the resultsof monitoring the previous land and resource management plan; and otheranalytical tools used in planning. <T3>3.31</T3>_<T3>Capability, Analysis, and Management Areas. </T3>Delineation of capability,analysis, and management areas forms the basis for analysis in the forestplanning process. 1. A capability area is an identifiable, contiguous area of land that,because of its characteristics, responds to management prescriptions relativelythe same throughout its area. Retain maps delineating capability areasas part of the planning records. 2. An analysis area consists of one or more capability areas grouped togetherfor the purpose of conducting analysis. 3. A management area consists of one or more capability or analysis areasor portions thereof. It is an area with specific management goals, objectives,standards, and guidelines that comprise the management prescription forthe land area. <T3>3.32</T3>_<T3>Data and FORPLAN Coefficients </T3>1. The following documentation requirements apply to all resource, economic,social, and budgetary data collected or generated in the planning process.Note that the requirements apply to both qualitative and quantitative datathat are to be maintained as part of the planning records. a. Record the source or method of data collection or generation. For example,if water quality data is collected by sampling certain streams, describethe sampling procedure. Also, describe or cite the timber inventory andyield projection procedure. List and describe simulation models used togenerate certain coefficients and model assumptions and results. Also,state whether the data are based on experience, published documents, and/orprofessional judgment. If the data are based on published information,cite the source. b. Describe the accuracy and precision of the data. c. List assumptions associated with the data collection or generation processes.d. Set forth the methods or basis for projecting future yields or results.2. Describe the structure and components of any data base management systemused. Retain a copy of the final data base used during development of theforest plan until the plan is revised. 3. The FORPLAN Version 2 data only matrix print-out (FORPLAN Users Guide)meets the requirement to document the coefficients associated with eachanalysis area and prescription. Clearly describe the process used to developcoefficients, the individuals responsible for coefficient development,and the assumptions and agreements reached in their development and defineany codes or abbreviations used. <T3>3.33</T3>_<T3>Analytical Tools. </T3>Various analytical models such as FORPLAN, IMPLAN,simulation models, fire analysis models, transportation analysis models,cost-benefit tools, and fish and wildlife habitat capability models mayhave been used during the planning process. If so, record in the planningrecords the: 1. Purpose of the model and the role it played in the planning process.2. Assumptions of the model.3. Details needed to understand the implications of using the model orof interpreting its results.4. Source, version, author, date, and any literature describing the particularmodel or tool.<T3>3.4_ANALYSIS OF THE MANAGEMENT SITUATION.</T3> The analysis of themanagement situation converts inventory data into management informationto determine if it is necessary to change or establish management direction.The analysis provides the basis for a range of alternative ways to solvethe management problem and for development of management prescriptionsto provide management direction. Conduct benchmark analysis to define therange of the alternatives.3.41_<T3>Required Analysis. </T3>Conduct an analysis of the current managementsituation to determine whether there is a need for new management direction.Sections 3.41a through 3.41d specify minimum standards for documentingthis analysis.3.41a_<T3>Description of Current Management Situation. </T3>Describe the currentmanagement situation in the following manner:1. Summarize existing management direction to include current goals andobjectives, standards and guidelines, and land classifications.2. Refer to existing management plans.3. Summarize actual current outputs and activities, including road systemdevelopment and operating strategy.4. Describe projected outputs and activities if current management directionwere to continue into the future. If different than projections shown inthe forest plan, display forest plan projections and explain the differences.5. Describe the expected future condition of the forest if current managementdirection were to continue.6. Describe any known problems with the existing direction or situation.7. Keep a copy of the FORPLAN results of current management (no actionalternative) in the planning records.<T3>3.41b_Benchmark Analysis.</T3> The minimum requirements of benchmarkanalysis are set forth in FSM 1922.12. Document the benchmark analysisas follows:1. Describe the formulation of the benchmarks; include purpose, objectives,assumptions, constraints, and FORPLAN input.2. Maintain a copy of the final FORPLAN analysis of each benchmark.3. Describe the outcome of benchmark analysis to indicate what was learnedabout forest capabilities and limitations, interaction among resources,and the forest's ability to respond to known issues or concerns.<T3>s3.41c_Resource Demand Projections.</T3> In documenting resource demandprojections, include:1. The source of information and methodology for generating demand projections.2. The assumptions pertinent to trends in population size, growth, andcomposition; trends in employment; identification of areas of populationgrowth and decline; a description of the structure of the local and regionaleconomy; and trends in resource utilization and consumption.3. An evaluation of the sensitivity of projected demands to changing conditions.4. Identification of the market area.5. A discussion of price-quantity relationships_past, current, and future_whenthe data are available.6. The relationship of total demand to projected supply from other, adjacentNational Forests and from non-National Forest System lands.7. The projected demand.<T3>3.41d_Analytical Conclusions.</T3> Document the conclusions drawn fromthe analysis of the current situation, the benchmarks, and the demand projections.Include:1. An assessment of the forest's capability to supply (produce) goods andservices, including adequacy of the current transportation system.2. An assessment of the demand for goods and services from the forest.3. The need and opportunities for the forest to establish or change managementdirection.4. An assessment of the ability to resolve issues and concerns throughthe planning process.5. An assessment and display of the range within which it is possible toformulate alternatives.<T3>3.42_Benchmark Requirements. </T3>Benchmarks approximate maximum economicand biological resource production opportunities, are useful in evaluatingthe compatibilities and conflicts between individual resource objectives,and help define the range within which integrated alternatives can be developed.The following principles govern benchmark development:1. Benchmarks display a forest's physical, biological, economic, and technicalcapabilities. They are not to be limited by Forest Service policy or budget,discretionary constraints, or program and staffing requirements. It mustbe physically and technically feasible to implement benchmark managementsituations, but it may not be prudent to do so.2. Benchmarks provide an analytical base for developing alternatives andprovide a reference point for comparison among alternatives.3. The purpose of benchmarks is not only to approximate the resource potentialsbut also to establish the degree of change from current management thatcan occur.4. Each benchmark:a. Must be consistent with the management requirements and must indicatewhether they are met.b. Must comply with a base sale schedule (nondeclining yield) of timberharvest and permit scheduling of the harvest of even-aged stands generallyat or beyond culmination of mean annual increment of growth. Timber-significantforests (FSM 1922.15(6)) shall evaluate relaxation of both the base saleschedule and harvest generally at or beyond culmination of mean annualincrement (FSH 1909.13).c. Must not be constrained by forest budgets. d. Must use maximum present net value (market values) as the objectivefunction in FORPLAN except as noted below for the resource specific benchmarks.<T3>3.42a</T3>_<T3>Minimum Level Management Benchmark. </T3>This benchmark representsthe minimum level of management needed to maintain and protect the unitas part of the National Forest System. Think of minimum level as the levelof management necessary to meet the background outputs and fixed costsassociated with maintaining the National Forest in Federal ownership. Becauseit is only an accounting analysis, ignore the phase-in period that wouldbe necessary if the minimum level were actually implemented.1. <T3>Specifications:</T3>a. The objective function is to minimize cost for the planning horizon.b. The management objectives are:(1) Protect the life, health, and safety of incidental users;(2) Prevent environmental damage to the land or resources of adjoininglands of other ownerships or downstream users;(3) Conserve soil and water resources;(4) Prevent significant or permanent impairment of the productivity ofthe land; and(5) Administer unavoidable non-Forest Service special uses and mineralleases, licenses, permits, contracts, and operating plans.c. Incidental outputs are permissable but there is to be no managementthat would produce timber, range, and developed recreation outputs.d. Vegetation is to follow natural succession.e. Maintenance is only for those facilities needed to support the basicownership activities. Allow all other facilities to deteriorate. Greatlyreduce the fire organization.f. Dispersed recreation use that cannot be discouraged or controlled isto occur.g. Cultural resource management is to be at a minimum level and is primarilyfor identification and protection of the resources in conjunction withany proposed ground disturbing activities.<T3>3.42b_Maximum Present Net Value with Assigned Values Benchmark.</T3>The purpose of establishing this benchmark is to estimate the mix of resourceuses and a schedule of outputs and costs that would maximize the presentnet value of outputs assigned a monetary value. Base dollar values on actualor simulated market prices (willingness to pay) for timber, recreation,range, water, minerals, and wildlife and fish, as appropriate for the forest.Minimum specific management requirements and nondeclining yield requirementsapply to this benchmark.<T3>3.42c_Maximum Present Net Value with Market Values Only Benchmark.</T3>The purpose of establishing this benchmark is to estimate the mix of resourceuses and determine a schedule of outputs and costs that would maximizethe present net value of those outputs that have an established marketprice. Base dollar values on actual market prices for timber, range, commerciallyutilized fish, minerals, and developed recreation.Minimum specific management requirements and nondeclining yield requirementsalso apply to this benchmark.Run the solution through the FORPLAN report writer to price out assignedmarket values. Use the PNV-COST values from the second report to make comparisons.<T3>3.42d_Current Level Benchmark.</T3> This benchmark provides for managementusing the current plan, adjusted to incorporate changes necessary to meetcurrent management direction. The benchmark estimates the capability ofthe planning area to provide for a wide range of goods, services, and otheruses from the present land allocation. This benchmark meets all requirementsspecified in the regulations (36 CFR, Part 219).<T3>3.42e_Maximum Timber Benchmark. </T3>All forests with lands identifiedas tentatively suitable for timber production should establish this benchmarkto define the maximum timber output possible for the first 5 decades ofthe plan under current policies and minimum specific management requirements.To establish this benchmark:1. Perform three FORPLAN model runs. The first run uses an objective functionthat maximizes timber values for the first decade.2. Perform the second run (called a ``rollover'') to ensure that the maximumamount of timber is produced for fifteen decades.3. Perform the third run, constrained by the results of the first two,to maximum PNV for fifteen decades.4. Apply nondeclining yield requirement.5. Apply management requirements.<T3>3.42f_Maximum Range Benchmark.</T3> The purpose of this benchmark isto define the maximum capability of the forest to provide commercial livestockgrazing, subject to minimum management requirements.For this benchmark:1. Perform two model runs. The first must maximize livestock forage productionfor 5 periods.2. Perform the second run to ensure that the maximum amount of forage isproduced in an economically efficient manner by using the maximum productionspecified in the first run as right-hand-site range constraint and by rerunningFORPLAN with a maximum present net value objective function.3. Apply management requirements.<T3>3.42g_Maximum Wilderness Benchmark.</T3> The purpose of this benchmarkis to evaluate the impacts of a maximum wilderness recommendation.The specifications for this benchmark are:1. The objective function maximizes present net value for the planninghorizon.2. All roadless and wilderness study areas have wilderness prescriptions.Do not adjust boundaries; use the largest, unroaded area (see inventorycriteria at section 7.11).3. Apply management requirements.4. Apply nondeclining yield requirement.<T3>3.42h</T3>_<T3>Maximum Nonwilderness Benchmark. </T3>The purpose of this benchmarkis to evaluate the impacts on no additional wilderness designations. The specifications for this benchmark are: 1. The objective function maximizes present net value for the planninghorizon. 2. All roadless and wilderness study areas have nonwilderness prescriptions.Existing wildernesses remain designated. 3. Apply management requirements. 4. Apply nondeclining yield requirement. <T3>3.42i</T3>_<T3>Maximum Present Net Value with Assigned Values_Departure Benchmark.</T3>The purpose of establishing this benchmark is to estimate the mixof resource uses and outputs as identified in section 3.42b without theconstraints of meeting nondeclining yield requirements. This benchmarkis developed only on timber significant forests as described in FSM 1922.15(6).The only specification for this benchmark is that minimum specific managementrequirements apply. <T3>3.43</T3>_<T3>Management Prescriptions. </T3>Document management prescriptions availablefor selection as follows: 1. Describe the process used to develop prescriptions, including stepstaken to ensure all feasible prescriptions were considered. Show how theprocess identified a reasonable range of prescription and included themost economically efficient prescriptions. 2. List the assumptions made while developing prescriptions and the basisfor those assumptions. 3. Identify practices (activities), outputs, and costs associated witheach prescription. 4. Describe the objectives of each prescription. 5. List the critieria used to determine which prescriptions are subitableor possible for each analysis area. These criteria include, but are notlimited to:a. A definition of resource capability; for example, only forest typesthat can be regenerated within 5 years following final harvest removalcutting are suitable for timber production. b. Qualifying/disqualifying attributes; for example, any prescription requiringconstruction of roads is not suitable within existing wildernesses. c. A definition of lands not available for timber, mineral entry, or otherresource management; for example, designated wildernesses are not availablefor timber production. d. A definition of access strategy; for example, low standard, low-densityroads controlled by gates or regulation to protect wildlife habitat. e. A list of criteria for compatibility of management emphasis for eachanalysis area. 6. Describe all suitable prescriptions by analysis area. The FORPLAN matrixfiles can document this. <T3>3.5</T3>_<T3>FORMULATION OF ALTERNATIVES. </T3>Formulate a broad range of reasonablealternatives that address major public issues, management concerns, andresource use and development opportunities. See FSM 1922.13 for the minimumrequirements for formulating alternatives. Document the process used toformulate alternatives in the planning records. For each alternative analyzed,document: 1. The overall management approach and resource emphasis. 2. Management goals and objectives and how they relate and respond to identifiedissues, concerns, and opportunities. 3. Standards and guidelines necessary to achieve the alternative.4. The relationship of the alternative to benchmarks and how it falls withinthe range of management opportunities defined by the benchmarks. 5. The FORPLAN and other constraints imposed. Include the rationale forconstraints, the constraint analysis (that is, an assessment of the costsof the constraint), and an evaluation indicating that the constraints werethe most cost efficient means to achieve the objectives of each alternative.<T3>3.51</T3>_<T3>Guiding Principles. </T3>The following principles govern developmentof alternatives: 1. In any alternative, ensure that a forest is not proposing to producemore of an output than its maximum capability. 2. Management requirements set forth in 36 CFR 219.27 must be met. 3. Alternatives must use the same dollar values and estimated levels ofeconomic demands for priced outputs as those used in the benchmarks. 4. Ensure the alternatives, through their range, respond to stated issuesand concerns. Explain that each alternative responds differently to theissues and concerns, based upon the overall goal of the alternative. 5. Always examine departures from the base sale schedule for the preferredalternative and for any other alternative that satisfies at least one ofthe departure conditions (36 CFR 219.16(a)(3) and section 34 of FSH 2409.13).6. In examining departures, those forests designated by FSM 1922.15(6)to conduct additional analysis must explore the possibility of using rotationlengths less than indicated by culmination of mean annual increment (CMAI).Other forests shall conduct such departure analyses as necessary to addresspublic issues, management concerns, or resource use and development opportunities.7. With two exceptions, do not apply budget constraints to any alternativeconsidered in detail if the constraint results in foregoing economicallyefficient commodity and/or noncommodity production opportunities. The firstexception is a budget constraint that may be applied to the current direction/noaction alternative. The second exception is that budget constraints maybe applied to alternatives specifically designed to define the implicationsof that budget constraint, provided that the environmental impact statement:a. Explicitly states the purpose of the alternative. b. Displays the specific implications of imposing the budget constraint.c. Does not reduce the obligation to discuss a full range of reasonablealternatives that reflect the budgetary authority granted in recent appropriationsand that reflect probable future funding levels.<T3>3.52</T3>_<T3>Current Direction (No Action) Alternative. </T3>Each plan must identifythe current direction (no action) alternative. 1. <T3>Purpose. </T3>The purpose of the no action alternative is to reflectthe existing levels of outputs and to estimate the expected outputs andservices that would be possible to provide in the future if current allocations,direction, policies, and practices were to continue. 2. <T3>Specifications. </T3>a. Use land classification assignments that exist is current plans. b. Meet management requirements and indicate how current direction mayhave changed in response to better timber yield data. c. Reflect the Administration's current recommendations for wilderness,wilderness study, and wild and scenic river designation. Assume that otherroadless areas and wild and scenic rivers would be open to the full rangeof multiple-use prescriptions. 3.53<T3>_</T3>Emphasis of Market Opportunities Alternative. The purpose ofthis required alternative is to emphasize market resources, such as timber,range, minerals, commerical fish, and developed recreation. Managementfor other resources would be economically efficient, environmentally feasible,and consistent with emphasis on market outputs. 3.54<T3>_</T3><T3>Emphasis on Nonmarket (Amenity) Opportunities Alternative. </T3>Thepurpose of this required alternative is to emphasize nonmarket resources,such as fish and wildlife, dispersed recreation, and wilderness, with marketoutputs of economically efficient and environmentally feasible levels.<T3>3.55</T3><T3>_</T3>Emphasis on Meeting Assigned Renewable Resource Program OutputsAlternative. This required alternative determines how best to implementthe most current RPA Program as distributed to a forest through the regionalguide. The assigned program is not to be a constraint in the considerationof other alternatives or in selection of the preferred alternative.<T3>3.56</T3>_<T3>Wilderness Emphasis with Capital Investment Emphases on Remaining LandsAlternative</T3>1. <T3>Purpose. </T3>The purpose of this required alternative is to emphasizewilderness and evaluate the potential for maintaining or increasing marketoutputs on the nonwilderness portions of the forest through intensifiedmanagement. 2. <T3>Specifications</T3>a. This alternative is not necessarily the maximum wilderness alternative.However, be sure that it has a fairly substantial amount of quality roadlessacres recommended for wilderness. b. Assure intensive management of nonwilderness lands in this alternativeto maintain or increase commodity outputs as compared to the current. Ifthis level of output is not feasible, come as close as possible to thecurrent. Accomplish intensive management in an economically efficient manner.<T3>3.57</T3>_<T3>Other Alternatives. </T3>Other alternatives are developed to describea complete range of reasonable choices available to the decisionmaker.Be sure that there are no significant gaps or voids between the upper andlower limits established through benchmark analysis. <T3>3.58</T3>_<T3>Constraints on Alternatives </T3>1. List and describe constraints for every planning alternative analyzedin detail. Separate those that are common to all alternatives, such asconstraints required to honor management requirements, from those thatvary by alternative. 2. Explain in detail why each constraint, or related set of constraints,is necessary. Explain how the constraints meet management requirements,environmental standards, or multiple-use goals and objectives. The identificationof issues, concerns, and opportunities should provide specific reasonsfor having certain constraints; if so, explain.3. To the extent that discretionary constraints common to each alternativeare additional to those required to meet management requirements (and arenot necessary to ensure technically implementable), explain why it is necessaryto include them in every alternative or why they do not vary among alternatives.4. Define the monetary opportunity costs and other resource implicationsof constraints that significantly reduce present net value. Always do thisfor constraints that are common to all alternatives. Make every effortto make these determinations during the systemmatic process of formulatingalternatives. 5. Describe the processes used to test and evaluate all constraints toensure that they are cost efficient in achieving the objectives of eachalternative. <T3>3.6</T3>_<T3>ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF ALTERNATIVES. </T3>Completing this planning actionprovides information for comparing alternatives and their response to publicissues, management concerns, and resource opportunities. Use the resultsto evaluate and recommend selection of a preferred alternative and to preparethe draft environmental impact statement. Document analytical procedures,data sources, and the evaluation process in consideration of the effectson: 1. Outputs of goods and services. 2. Sustained yield and productivity of resources. 3. The physical and biological environment. 4. The social and economic environment. 5. Prime farmlands, wetlands, floodplains, and energy requirements. <T3>3.7</T3>_<T3>EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES AND PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION.</T3>Evaluation of forest plan alternatives leads to the Forest Supervisor'srecommendation of a preferred alternative to be displayed in the draftEIS and as the proposed forest plan. Document the evaluation proceduresin the planning records leading to the draft EIS and proposed plan recommendation,but do not make these available for public review until the record of decisionaccompanying the final plan and environmental impact statement is madeavailable to the public. Adjustments to the draft may be made, based upon public input and otherfactors, in preparation of the final plan and environmental impact statement.During this process, the following is considered predecisional, deliberativeinformation (FSM 6270) and is not be displayed until the record of decisionis prepared: 1. The process used to evaluate the alternatives and to arrive at the preferredalternative. 2. The physical, biological, social, and economic criteria used to evaluatethe alternatives. 3. The results of the evaluation. <T3>3.8</T3>_<T3>PLAN APPROVAL. </T3>Document procedures used in approving the finalforest plan in the record for decision. The decision is made by the RegionalForester, based on the recommendation of the Forest Supervisor, followinganalysis of public comment on the draft plan and EIS.Chapter 4_Forest Planning Documents<ITAG tagnum="81">Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.1 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT OUTLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.11 Summary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.12 Chapter 1_Purpose and Need</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.13 Chapter 2_Alternatives Including the Proposed Action</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.14 Chapter 3_Affected Environment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.15 Chapter 4_Environmental Consequences</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.16 Chapter 5_List of Preparers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.17 Chapter 6_List of Agencies, Organizations, and Persons to WhomCopies of the Statement are Sent</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.18 Index</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.19 Appendices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.19a Appendix A_Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.19b Appendix B_Description of Analysis Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.19c Appendix C_Roadless Area Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.19d Appendix D_Forest Service Response to Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.2 FOREST PLAN OUTLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.21 Chapter 1_Forest Plan Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.22 Chapter 2_Summary of the Analysis of the Management Situation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.23 Chapter 3_Response to Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24 Chapter 4_Forest Management Direction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24a Forest Management Goals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24b Forest Management Objectives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24c Standards and Guidelines</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24d Desired Future Condition of the Forest</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.24e Management Prescriptions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">4.25 Chapter 5_Implementation of the Forest Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.25a Implementation Direction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.25b Monitoring and Evaluation Process</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.25c Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.26 Glossary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.27 Appendices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.3 RECORD OF DECISION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.31 Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.32 The Decision</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.33 Alternatives and Issues Considered</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.34 Rationale for the Decision</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.35 Mitigation and Monitoring</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.36 Implementation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.37 Appeal Rights</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">14.38 Approval</ITAG>This chapter describes the documentation of the planning process by providingan outline for the contents of environmental impact statement accompanyingthe forest plan and for the plan itself.<T3>4.1</T3>_<T3>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT OUTLINE. </T3>Direction for environmentalimpact statement preparation is in 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508, FSM 1950, andFSH 1909.15.

Include the title and addressof the Forest Supervisor as a source of information about the plan. Thepreface should include the following statement: If any particular provision of this proposed action, or the applicationof the action to any person or circumstances, is found to be invalid, theremainder of the proposed action and the application of that provisionto other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. b. <T3>Contents. </T3>Include a standard table of contents and a list of maps,tables, and figures. The standardized arrangement of the table of contentsfollows the order in section 4.21 through section 4.27. <T3>4.21_Chapter 1_Forest Plan Introduction. </T3>This chapter introducesthe general purpose of the forest plan and the plan structure, and explainshow the plan relates to the environmental impact statement and other documents.It also provides a brief description of the forest. 1. <T3>Purpose of the Forest Plan. </T3>The following text is suggested: The Forest Plan guides all natural resource management activities and establishesmanagement standards and guidelines for the <T2>XXXX</T2> National Forest. It describes resource management practices,levels of resource production and management, and the availability andsuitability of lands for resource management. The Forest Plan embodies the provisions of the National Forest ManagementAct, the implementing regulations, and other guiding documents. Land usedeterminations, prescriptions, and standards and guidelines constitutea statement of the plan's management direction; however, the projectedoutputs, services, and rates of implementation are dependent on the annualbudgeting process. 2. <T3>Relationship of the Forest Plan to Other Documents. </T3>The followingtext is suggested: This Forest Plan sets forth the preferred alternative for managing theland and resources of the <T2>XXXX</T2> National Forest. The Plan results from extensive analysisand considerations addressed in the accompanying environmental impact statement(EIS). The planning process and the analysis procedures used to developthis Plan are described or referred to in the EIS. The EIS also describesother alternatives considered in the planning process. Specific activitiesand projects will be planned and implemented to carry out the directionin this plan. The Forest will perform environmental analysis on these projectsand activities. This subsequent environmental analysis will use the dataand evaluations in the Plan and environmental impact statement as its basis.Environmental analysis of projects will be tiered to the EIS accompanyingthis Forest Plan. 3. <T3>Plan Structure. </T3>This section intruduces the reader to the interrelatedpurposes of the plan chapters 2 through 5. 4. <T3>Forest Description. </T3>This section describes the location of theforest. Include forest location maps showing national, regional, and localvicinity of the administrative unit covered by the plan. Place all threemaps on a single page if possible. <T3>4.22_Chapter 2_Summary of the Analysis of the Management Situation.</T3>This chapter of the plan briefly summarizes the supply and demandconditions for significant market and nonmarket goods and services associatedwith the planning area. Briefly describe special conditions affecting supplyor demand.1. <T3>Resource Supply Conditions.</T3> This section includes a summary displayof the constrained maximum physical and biological production potentialsfor significant individual goods and services (maximum resource level benchmarks)identified in the analysis of the management situation (sec. 3.4). Alsoinclude displays of the production levels that are attainable under currentmanagement direction. Guidelines for each of the production levels areas follows:a. Maximum Production Potential. The highest level of a particular outputor use that it would be possible to produce over time considering legaland other requirements.b. Production Under Current Management Direction (No-Action Alternative).The level of goods and services provided under current management direction,as constrained by current forest budgets, and the most likely level ofgoods and services expected to be provided under probable budgets if currentmanagement direction continues.c. Use and Development Opportunities. The opportunities available to permitand promote use and development of the various resources, including landstatus and adjustment situations.2. <T3>Resource Demand Projections.</T3> In this section include a summarydisplay of projected demands for the significant goods and services addressedin the Analysis of the Management Situation. Display both supply and demandconditions for each of the National Recourses Planning Act planning periods.All of the above mentioned supply and demand condition levels may be containedin a single table.3. <T3>Research Needs.</T3> This section addresses the research needs identifiedby the Forest Supervisor. In the proposed plan, they are considered asresearch proposals subject to the approval of the Regional Forester. Pointout in the final plan that the set of research needs may expand if monitoringand evaluation identify additional needs.<T3>4.23_Chapter 3_Response to Issues, Concerns, and Opportunities.</T3>Include this chapter in the forest plan if it is necessary to discuss informationnot included in the environmental impact statement (EIS). If not, incorporatethe discussion in the EIS by reference.<T3>4.24_Chapter 4_Forest Management Direction.</T3> This chapter presentsthe management goals, objectives, standards and guidelines that constitutedirection for resource management covered by the plan. Ensure that appendicesprepared do not include direction, but supplement, clarify, and supportforest management direction.<T3>4.24a_Forest Management Goals.</T3> Present the multiple use and othergoals established in the planning process to develop the preferred alternative.Include any other goals that are part of the definition of management direction.<T3>4.24b_Forest Management Objectives.</T3> In this section, list theoverall objectives in narrative form, explain how the projected outputsalso serve as objectives, and introduce resource summaries.1. <T3>Projected Outputs.</T3> Display the levels of goods and services anticipatedas the plan is implemented. Clarify the fact that outputs are projectionsbased on available inventory data and assumptions, subject to the annualbudget. Display these outputs in a chart that shows how they vary duringfive planning decades. Express outputs on an average annual yield per decadebasis; use NAS codes and definitions whenever possible.2. <T3>Resource Summaries.</T3> Prepare narrative summaries of resource outputsand schedules for attainment. Supplement the narrative statements withcharts and tables as indicated.a. Include timber resource summaries that describe timber productivity,land suitability, allowable sale quantity, vegetation management practices,and planned timber sales. See FSH 2409.13, Timber Resource Planning Handbookfor additional information.b. Present other resource summaries and schedules for activities such aswildlife and fisheries habitat improvement, road construction, range improvements,vegetation burning, and other capital investments. Include the detailedschedules as appendices to the plan. It is suggested that these schedulescover the same timeframe as the planned timber sales schedule.<T3>4.24c_Standards and Guidelines.</T3> Forest-wide standards and guidelinesstate the bounds or constraints within which all practices are to be carriedout in achieving the planned objectives. Standards and guidelines shouldbe measurable to be meaningful. List the forest-wide management standardsand guidelines that are applicable to all management areas. Then list thosethat are applicable only to specific management areas.<T3>4.24d_Desired Future Condition of the Forest.</T3> The future conditionof the forest is as much a part of management goals and objectives as areoutputs and effects. This section on the desired condition describes whatthe forest should be like after implementation of the management directioncontained in the plan. It summarizes the anticipated physical changes thatwould result from carrying out planned management practices. Emphasizewhat the physical structure of the forest would be at the end of 10 years,at the end of 50 years, and beyond, as appropriate, especially when themanagement plan calls for departures from the base timber sale schedule.Examples of the physical structural components include stand compositionand age structure, miles of road, acres of roadless area, numbers and kindsof facilities, acre-feet of water produced, and other dimensions as appropriate.<T3>4.24e_Management Prescriptions.</T3> This section contains the managementprescriptions and the standards and guidelines that apply to each managementarea. Management prescriptions are management practices scheduled for implementationon a defined management area.1. Describe management prescriptions in a standard format and include thealpha-numeric code associated with the prescription in the planning process.2. List the probable management practices constituting each managementprescription. Use NAS codes and definitions of management practices tosimplify the formulation of annual program budgets.3. For prescriptions that involve vegetation manipulation, indicate howand why these prescriptions are associated with the various vegetativetypes manipulated on the forest. State the objectives of the prescriptionor set of prescriptions and the desired results as applied to a given vegetativetype.4. Address access management in each management area and further refineit in the standards and guidelines. Where necessary, establish directionto define the way access is provided and managed to meet access goals.Access direction should include all modes of transportation, timing ofnecessary actions, and the mix of facility management objectives neededto meet forest plan goals.<ITAG tagnum="86"/>5. Write standards and guidelines for each management area to meet therequirements of 36 CFR 219.11(c). In addition, address each of the resourcesdiscussed in 36 CFR Part 219.13 through 219.26 by standards and guidelines,management prescriptions, or other management direction in the plan ifsignificant on the forest. The resource integration requirements are oftensynonymous with the managment standards and guidelines they are to be associatedwith.6. Write direction for any proposed special areas (wilderness, wild andsenic rivers, national trails, research natural areas, national recreationareas, and national forest monuments) as if they are already designatedspecial areas. Existing and proposed special areas may be defined as individualmanagement areas, as parts of other management areas, or as a combinationof several management areas when they are very large and when internalmanagement needs vary significantly from location to location. Directionfor existing special areas may be incorporated by reference, indicatingthe process by which the existing direction was developed.<T3>4.25_Chapter 5_Implementation of the Forest Plan.</T3> This chapterincorporates direction in three sections under the headings of ImplementationDirection, Monitoring and Evaluation Program, and Amendment. Collectively,these sections explain methods of implementing management direction, monitoringand evaluating implementation activities, and of keeping the plan currentin light of changing conditions or other findings. See chapter 5 of thishandbook for further discussion of the process for forest plan implementation.See chapter 6 for a discussion of monitoring and evaluation.<T3>4.25_Implementation Direction.</T3> Explain that implementation ofthe forest plan occurs through identification, selection, scheduling, andexecution of management practices to meet management direction providedin the plan. Implementation also involves responding to proposals by othersfor use and/or occupancy of National Forest System lands. Additional requirementsof this section include a need to show consistency of other plans or instrumentswith the forest plan, formulation of budget proposals, and environmentalanalysis required for implementation of specific management practices.1. <T3>Scheduling.</T3> The identification and selection of management practicesmust meet the requirements of FSM 1922.4 and chapter 5 of this handbook.Scheduling of the practices is in response to the management directionin the forest plan and the near-term management needs and opportunities.Additional requirements for timber sale scheduling is found in FSH 2409.13.Execution is in response to the annual budget.2. <T3>Consistency with Other Instruments.</T3> This section of the forestplan sets a target date for achieving consistency, subject to valid existingrights, for all outstanding and future permits, contracts, cooperativeagreements, and other instruments for occupancy and use of lands includedin the forest plan. In an appendix, list plans that the forest plan supersedesor that must come into compliance with the forest plan.3. <T3>Budget Proposals.</T3> This section of the forest plan translates scheduledpractices into multiyear program budget proposals. Use the schedule forrequesting and allocating the funds needed to carry out the planned managementdirection. The plan should state that, upon approval of a final budget,the forest finalizes and implements the annual program of work. Accomplishmentof the annual program of work results in the incremental implementationof the management direction of the forest plan.4. <T3>Environmental Analysis.</T3> This section of the forest plan indicatesthat management practices proposed within the forest plan are subject toenvironmental analysis as they are planned for implementation. Follow therequirements of 40 CFR 1502.20, FSM 1950, and FSH 1909.15 in determiningsubsequent environmental analysis and documentation. An analysis file and/ora project file must be available for public review, but it is not alwaysnecessary to document the analysis in the form of an environmental assessmentor environmental impact statement.<T3>4.25_Monitoring and Evaluation Process.</T3> This section of the forestplan describes how the forest is to meet monitoring and evaluation requirements.Refer to chapter 6 of this handbook for a discussion of the monitoringand evaluation process.1. <T3>Monitoring</T3>_Identify the monitoring program necessary to meet theminimum requirements of 36 CFR 219.5(a)(7), 219.11(d), and 219.12(d) and(k) as well as any additional monitoring needs. Describe the monitoringactivities and methods that are to satisfy the identified monitoring requirements.State the actions, effects, or resources to be measured and the frequencyof measurement for each of these, including the periodic intervals betweenmeasurements and the sampling schemes. Estimate the procision and reliabilityof the monitoring program. Identify ongoing accomplishment reporting processes,such as PAMARS and annual attainment reports, used to monitor actions,effects, and/or resources.2. <T3>Evaluation.</T3> Identify the evaluation program necessary to meetthe minimum requirements of 36 CFR 219.12(k)(1), (2), (3), and (5); 219.10(e)and (g); and 219.7(f).<T3>4.25c_Amendment.</T3> This part of the forest plan describes the opportunitiesand procedures for amendment of the plan. Refer to chapter 5 of this handbookfor a discussion of the amendment process.<T3>4.26_Glossary.</T3> This section contains forest plan terms that requirecommon understanding or that have special meanings. Include those termsin 36 CFR 219.3 that you use in the plan along with their given definitions.<T3>4.27_Appendices.</T3> This part of the forest plan contains supplementalplan information that is explanatory in nature. Appendices may includemanagement area maps, timber sale schedules, and other activity schedulesand costs as appropriate.<T3>4.3_RECORD OF DECISION.</T3> The Council on Environmental Quality regulationsfor implementing the National Environmental Policy Act require a Federalagency to prepare a concise public record of decision whenever the agencyundertakes an action requiring an environmental impact statement. The purposeof the record of decision is to describe a rational basis for the decision.Because this record is often the first document read by the public, bythe reviewing officer in an administrative appeal under 36 CFR 211.18,or by a judge in a lawsuit, write it in non-technical language. The recordof decision is the primary document that summarizes a basis and need forthe decision; it thereby allows the reader to decide whether the agencymade a reasoned choice among the alternatives.1. Make the record of decision brief. To avoid unnecessary repetition,refer to specific pages of the plan and final environmental impact statementwhenever possible. The record of decision can also serve as an index tothose two documents for particular subjects, facilitating the public'suse and understanding of them.2. Inform the readers of how to get copies of any forthcoming amendmentsand revisions of the plan.Contents of a record of decision are set forth in section 4.31 through4.37. The order in which the contents are listed in these sections canbe changed; topics may also be combined as long as the requirments of 40CFR 1505.2, FSM 1950, and FSH 1009.15 are met.<T3>4.31_Table of Contents.</T3> A table of contents or outline helps thereader locate subjects of particular interest and to understand how therecord of decision is organized. If the record consists of only a few pages,bold headings and subheadings, indentation, and so forth, may suffice.<T3>4.32_The Decision. </T3>State the decision to be made. Describe whatis being decided and what is not being decided. Establish the managementframework of which the plan is a part. Include an explanation of what theplan is and is not, similar to that in exhibit 1. Add specific commentsunique to the particular plan. Exhibit 1 <ITAG tagnum="84">Sample Introductory Paragraphs for the Record of Decision </ITAG>The forest plan is a strategy for managing the forest. It is not a planfor the various administrative activities needed to carry on the ForestService's day-to-day internal operations. For example, the plan does notaddress personnel matters, law enforcement, fleet equipment, or internalorganization changes. However, it is a plan for managing unit of the NationalForest System in an environmentally sound manner to produce goods and servicesin a way that maximizes long-term public benefits. The plan is part of the 50-year framework for long-range resource planningestablished by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act(RPA). As such, it establishes general direction for a period of time,usually between 10 and 15 years. Information regarding outputs and effectsbeyond this period are provided only to broadly indicate the currentlyanticipated consequences of each plan alternative if it is selected tocontinue into the future. However, the plan must be revised at least every15 years. Once adopted, the plan replaces all previous resource managementplans prepared for the forest, subject to existing rights, contracts, andspecific direction for special areas such as wilderness, wild and scenicrivers, national recreation areas, and national trails. The emphasis of the plan is not on site-specific decisions or specificresource outputs. Rather, the emphasis is on applying various general managementpractices at various intensities to areas of land to achieve multiple-usegoals and objectives in the most cost efficient manner. To respond to changingneeds and opportunities, Congressional land designations, catastrophicevents, or major new management or production technologies, the plan mayhave to be amended or revised. If there is a significant change to theplan, it must be altered by a procedure identical to that used in the developmentand approval of the original plan. If the change does not significantlyaffect the plan, the Forest Supervisor may amend it by a less extensiveprocedure to include public notification. It is important to note that all proposals in the plan can be accomplishedfrom a physical, biological, economic, and legal perspective. It is notcertain that these proposals will be accomplished. First, the outputs proposedby the plan are projections or targets. For example, the number of acre-feetof water meeting water quality goals is a target number the forest willstrive to attain. Another example is allowable sale quantity of timber.That is the maximum regulated volume of timber that can be sold over theplanning period, not necessarily the volume that will be sold. Secondly, all activities, many of which are interdependent, may be affectedby annual budgets. The plan is implemented through various site-specificprojects, such as the building of a road, development of a campground,or the sale of timber. If the budget changes for any given year coveredby the plan, the projects scheduled for that year may have to be rescheduled.However, the goals and land activity assignments described in the planwould not change unless the plan itself were changed. If budgets changesignificantly over a period of several years, the plan itself may haveto be amended and, consequently, would reflect different target outputsand environmental conditions. The significance of budget related or otherchanges is determined in the context of the particular circumstances. As a long-range strategy for the forest, this plan and accompanying environmentalimpact statement are programmatic. During implementation, when the variousprojects are designed, more site-specific analyses are performed. Theseanalyses may result in environmental assessments, environmental impactstatements, or categorical exclusions and, possibly, an amendment or revisionof the plan. Any resulting documents are to be tiered to the final environmentalimpact statement for this plan, pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.28. <T3>4.33_Alternatives and Issues Considered. </T3>Describe concisely allmajor issues identified in the draft environmental impact statement andnote new issues identified from public comments on the draft statement.Summarize all alternatives considered, referring to the more detailed descriptionsin the final environmental impact statement when appropriate. In this discussion,it is appropriate to summarize or emphasize public involvement and to describehow any alternatives from the draft environmental impact statement changedbecause of this involvement. Also, note new alternatives developed forthe final environmental impact statement as a result of public input. Referto the comments/response appendix and chapter 2 in the final EIS for detailson responses to alternatives and issues from the draft.<T3>4.34_Rationale for the Decision. </T3>Briefly describe management concernsand all factors (economic, technical, national policy, and so forth), regulations,and laws relevant to the decision. Describe the methods used to considerthe various issues and interests and how they balanced with all other factors,laws, and regulations. Explain that the companion document to the plan,the final environmental impact statement, discloses the environmental effectsof all alternatives considered, including the preferred alternative. Whereappropriate to explain the rationale, refer to specific pages of the EIS.A reviewing court is likely to want to know whether the agency took a ``hardlook'' and made a ``reasoned choice.'' The following elements are mandatoryin this section:1. <T3>Environmentally Preferable Alternatives. </T3>(40 CFR 1505.2(b)). Thissection requires the identification of the environmentally preferable alternativebut does not require its selection. More than one such alternative maybe described. Identify as environmentally preferable the alternative(s)having the least impact on the physical and biological environment; givesecondary consideration to the impact on the economic and social environment.The Council on Environmental Quality has defined ``environmentally preferable''as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The environmentally preferable alternative is the alternative thatwill promote the national environmental policy as expressed in NEPA's section101. Ordinarily, this means the alternative that causes the least damageto the biological and physical environment; it also means the alternativewhich best protects, preserves, and enhances historic, cultural, and naturalresources.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">After identifying the environmentally preferable alternative(s), comparethe selected alternative, which maximizes net public benefits (36 CFR 219.1(a), 219.3 and 219.12 (f)), to any other alternative(s) considered andidentified as environmentally preferable. This comparison is required by36 CFR 219.12 (j)(1). The comparison can be made by summarizing:a. A description of the difference between the environmental effects oroutputs that are likely to occur with implementation of environmentallypreferable alternatives and the environmental effects or outputs anticipatedwith implementation of the selected alternative.b. The objectives of the selected alternative in terms of priced and nonpricedoutputs and/or responses to expressed public issues that would not be likelyto occur with implementation of the environmentally preferable alternative(s).c. A summary of the major tradeoffs or differences between a and b, expressedin economic, environmental, physical, and/or other appropriate quantitativeand qualitative terms.d. An explanation showing why the selected alternative is expected to providegreater overall net public benefits than the environmentally preferablealternatives.Refer to the final environmental impact statement where appropriate. Inthis section of the record of decision, note that all alternatives meetminimum legal and environmental standards, but acknowledge and discussany environmental uncertainties.2. <T3>Alternatives with Higher Present Net Values. </T3>Identify the presentnet value (PNV) of the selected alternative. Then, as provided by 36 CFR219.12 (j)(2), compare the selected alternative to all other alternativeshaving a higher PNV. This requires summarizing:a. A description of the difference between the net value and mix of thepriced outputs that are likely to occur with implementation alternativeshaving a higher PNV and the net value and mix of the priced outputs anticipatedwith implementation of the selected alternative.b. The objective of the selected alternative in terms of priced and nonpricedoutputs and/or responses to expressed public issues that would not be likelyto occur with implementation alternatives having a higher implemented.c. A summary in the record of decision of the major tradeoffs of differencesbetween a and b expressed in economic, environmental, physical, and/orother appropriate quantitative and qualitative terms. d. An explanation showing why the selected alternative is likely to providegreater overall net public benefits than the alternatives with a higherPNV. 3. <T3>Areas of Public Interest. </T3>Identify all areas that have a highdegree of public interest and briefly describe how the plan proposes todeal with them. For example, if management of a wilderness with respectto visitor intensity or any other significant aspect is to be differentfrom management prior to the forest plan, describe these differences. Explainwhy a particular roadless area was or was not recommended for wildernessdesignation, is or is not to be scheduled for timber sales, and so forth.<T3>4.35_Mitigation and Monitoring. </T3>Mitigation measures are an essentialpart of each alternative and, consequently, require detailed descriptionin chapter 4 of the environmental impact statement. Refer to the mitigationmeasures, the minimum management requirements, the standards and guidelinesapplicable to the entire forest, and specific management prescriptionsin the plan. If all practicable measures were not taken, explain why not(40 CFR 1505.2(c)). The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) states inresponse to the 40 most asked questions concerning NEPA regulation (46FR 18026, March 23, 1981):<ITAG tagnum="21">The discussion of mitigation and monitoring in a Record of Decisionmust be more detailed than a general statement that mitigation is beingrequired, but not so detailed as to duplicate discussion of mitigationin the EIS. The Record of Decision should contain a concise summary identificationof the mitigation measures which the agency has committed itself to adopt.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">CEQ continues:<ITAG tagnum="21">To ensure that environmental effects of a proposed action are fairlyassessed, the probability of the mitigation measures being implementedmust also be discussed. Thus the EIS and the Record of Decision shouldindicate the likelihood that such measures will be adopted or enforcedby the responsible agencies.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Briefly describe the monitoring program and its purpose. State thatthe Forest Service uses the data gathered by the program to update itsinventory data, to improve future mitigation measures, and to assess theneed for amending or revising the plan. <T3>4.36_Implementation. </T3>Briefly describe any schedules used to implementthe plan and note how often they are to be updated (FSM 1922.51). Emphasizeany aspects of implementation that received special public attention orthat require clarification. The record of decision affords one more opportunityto speak to the public to clarify issues and eliminate any confusion aboutthe plan or its implementation. Be sure to refer to the most recent regionalor national policy on below-cost timber sales and note the differencesbetween sales policy and suitability determination if applicable. <T3>4.37_Appeal Rights. </T3>State appeal rights and associated time periods.In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2) and 36 CFR 221.18(c)(3), the appealperiod for approval of the land and resource management plan cannot expireprior to the later of the following two dates: 1. Thirty days after publication by the Environmental Protection Agencyof the Notice of Availability of the Final environmental impact statementaccompanying the plan. 2. Forty-five days from the date of decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The discussion of appeal rights is also an appropriate place to clarifyareas of confusion regarding appeals and their consequences. For example,consider addressing the following: 1. An appeal of a plan does not halt its implementation. A stay does. 2. If an individual or group is dissatisfied with a specific project, thatindividual or groups should appeal the plan if the site-specific decisionfor that project is made in the plan. Otherwise, they should appeal thesite-specific decision. 3. If applicable, note the appeal rights of (mineral) operators under 36CFR 228.14 or other avenues of appeal (36 CFR 211.18 (b)). <T3>4.38_Approval. </T3>The Regional Forester signs and dates the recordof decision.Chapter 5_Forest Plan Implementation and Amendment Process<ITAG tagnum="71">Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.1 PURPOSE OF FOREST PLAN IMPLEMENTATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.2 PROPOSED PROJECT AND ACTIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.3 ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.31 Findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.31a National Forest Management Act Findings</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.31b National Environmental Policy Act Compliance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.32 Process to Amend the Forest Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.4 DECISION AND DOCUMENTATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.5 BUDGET DEVELOPMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.6 PROJECT DESIGN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">5.7 PROJECT EXECUTION AND ADMINISTRATION</ITAG>This chapter establishes procedural guidance for implementing the forestplan through selecting and scheduling management practices that meet directionestablished by the forest plan. This chapter describes the process foranalyzing and determining consistency of actions with the forest plan andspecifies the process for amending the forest plan when change is necessary.Overall direction for forest plan implementation isn in FMS 1922.4 whileforest plan amendment is described in FMS 1922.5.<T3>5.1</T3>_<T3>PURPOSE OF FOREST PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. </T3>Forest plan implementation,the activity to accomplish the management direction of a forest plan, isnecessary to meet legal requirements and public expectations of ForestService actions. It is accomplished through identification of managementpractices; analysis and evaluation of proposed actions; deciding upon andappropriate course of action; and budget development, project execution,and administration. Implementation involves analysis of proposed and probablemanagement practices to meet both NFMA and NEPA requirements. The processof implementing the forest plan is shown in exhibit 1. Although the processis depicted as sequential, activities may be simultaneous or iterative.A discussion of the major actions in the forest plan implementation processfollows the exhibit.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 155</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-C </ITAG><T3>5.2</T3>_<T3>PROPOSED ACTIONS. </T3>Management prescriptions, including standardsand guidelines, and the schedule of management practices provide informationand direction needed to achieve the desired future condition of the forestas expressed by the goals and objectives of the forest plan. Proposed managementpractices are identified following review of this management direction.In addition, actions may be proposed by others outside the Forest Service.The following specifies the process for analysis and evaluation to select,approve, or reject proposed actions.<T3>5.3</T3>_<T3>ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION. </T3>The purpose of analysis and evaluationis to make site specific decisions based on Forest Plan direction. Theanalysis process includes an assimilation of management direction, currentissues, and site-specific data to make site specific decisions on landmanagement. Th analysis assists in determining costs, schedules, and direct,indirect, and culmulative effects of related management practices. An interdisciplinaryprocess must be used to address a single practice or multiple practiceswithin a given area. The responsible official determines the scope andgeographic area of analysis required to reach a well-reasoned decisionon proposed actions. Consider the following steps in identifying the scopeand area involved in analysis:1. Review data and information used in development of the forest plan;2. Consider the land management decisions to be made in any given geographicarea for the plan period; 3. Conduct scoping and determine issues, concerns, and other informationabout the area and the possible decisions to be made; 4. Determine the extent of the geographic area requiring analysis basedon identified issues, concerns, and resource opportunities;5. Determine the requirements for NEPA compliance, including the rangeof alternative actions, the potential for cumulative effects, and the possibilityof connected and cumulative actions; and6. Ensure that proposed management practices and actions are analyzed throughan integrated approach to resource management.<T3>5.31</T3>_<T3>Findings. </T3>The analysis provides information to evaluate proposedmanagement practices and actions, whether Forest Service or non-ForestService proposals, to determine findings for NFMA, to ensure compliancewith NEPA, and to meet other appropriate laws and regulations. Review ofthe findings is essential in making a well-reasoned decision.<T3>5.31a</T3>_<T3>National Forest Management Act Findings. </T3>The National Forest ManagementAct and implementing regulations require specific findings to be made whenimplementing the forest plan. In deciding on proposed management practices,the following findings must be made and documented.1. <T3>Consistency. </T3>All resource plans and permits, contracts, and otherinstruments for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands areto be consistent with the forest plan (16 U.S.C. 1604(i)). The forest planguides all natural resource management activities (36 CFR 219.1(b)). Alladministrative activities affecting the National Forest must be based onthe forest plan (36 CFR 219.10(e)). Thus, all management practices andactivities must be consistent with the forest plan. If a proposed projector alternative action is not consistent with the forest plan, there arethree options available for consideration: a. Modify the proposal to make it consistent with the forest plan;b. Reject the proposal; orc. Amend the plan to permit the proposal. Follow the direction in 5.32below to amend the forest plan.2. <T3>Suitability for Timber Production. </T3>No timber harvesting, otherthan salvage sales or sales to protect other multiple-use values, shalloccur on lands not suited for timber production (16 U.S.C. 1604(k) and36 CFR 219.27(c)(1)). When timber harvest is proposed and the land hasbeen determined to be suitable, a finding to that effect must be made.If the land is determined not suited for timber production and timber harvestingis proposed, a finding must ensure that harvesting is necessary to protectother multiple use values or activities. The finding should reference theappropriate management direction found in the forest plan, planning records,or environmental documents.3. <T3>Clearcutting and Even-aged Management. </T3>When a timber is to beharvested using an even-aged management system, a determination that thesystem is appropriate to meet the objectives and requirements of the forestplan must be made (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(F) (i) and (ii)). In addition,where clearcutting is to be used, it must be determined to be the optimummethod. Reference should be made to the discussions of even-aged managementcontained in the forest plan, planning records, or environmental documents.4. <T3>Vegetative Manipulation. </T3>All proposals that involve vegetativemanipulation of tree cover for any purpose must comply with the seven requirementsfound at 36 CFR 219.27(b). Reference the discussion or management directionfound in the forest plan, planning records, or environmental documents.<T3>5.31b_National Environmental Policy Act Compliance. </T3>The analysisof a management practice or action must comply with Forest Service environmentalpolices and procedures (FSM 1950 and SH 1909.15). Insure that adequateconsideration has been given to: 1. Scope of the action (including interconnected actions); 2. A reasonable range of alternative actions (including necessary mitigation);and 3. Site specific environmental effects (including direct, indirect, andcumulative effects). <T3>5.32_Process to Amend the Forest Plan. </T3>The following actions mustbe taken when a proposal is not consistent with the forest plan and theproposal is to be considered further for implementation. 1. Prepare a proposed amendment to the forest plan. 2. Make a determination of the significance of the change to the forestplan under 16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(4), 36 CFR 219.10(f), and FSM 1922.5. It isimportant to distinguish between significance of the change to a forestplan and significance of the environmental impacts of the proposed actionas defined by Council on Environmental Quality regulations found at 40CFR 1500 to 1508. 3. The following factors are to be used when determining whether a proposedchange to a forest plan is significant or not significant, based on NFMAplanning requirements. Other factors may also be considered, dependingon the circumstances. a. <T3>Timing. </T3>Identify when the change is to take place. Determine whetherthe change is necessary during or after the plan period (the first decade)or whether the change is to take place after the next scheduled revisionof the forest plan. In most cases, the later the change, the less likelyit is to be significant for the current forest plan. If the change is totake place outside the plan period, forest plan amendment is not required.b. <T3>Location and Size. </T3>Determine the location and size of the areainvolved in the change. Define the relationship of the affected area tothe overall planning area. In most cases, the smaller the area affected,the less likely the change is to be a significant change in the forestplan. c. <T3>Goals, Objectives, and Outputs. </T3>Determine whether the change alterslong-term relationships between the levels of goods and services projectedby the forest plan. Consider whether an increase in one type of outputwould trigger an increase or decrease in another. Determine whether thereis a demand for goods or services not discussed in the forest plan. Inmost cases, changes in outputs are not likely to be a significant changein the forest plan unless the change would forego the opportunity to achievean output in later years. d. <T3>Management Prescription. </T3>Determine whether the change in a managementprescription is only for a specific situation or whether it would applyto future decisions throughout the planning area. Determine whether ornot the change alters the desired future condition of the land and resourcesor the anticipated goods and services to be produced. 4. If the amendment is determined not to be a significant change to theforest plan, the Forest Supervisor may implement the amendment followingappropriate public notification and satisfactory compliance with ForestService environmental policies and procedures for the project or action.5. If the change to the forest plan is determined to be significant, followthe required 10 step planning process found at 36 CFR 219.12. Preparationof an environmental impact statement (EIS) is mandatory (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(4),36 CFR 219.10(f), and 36 CFR 219.12). The Forest Supervisor shall determinethe issues, concerns, and opportunities to be addressed in the amendmentand will normally concentrate on those issues that have generated the needfor change. <T3>5.4</T3>_<T3>DECISION AND DOCUMENTATION. </T3>The analysis and evaluation of managementpractices and actions provide information and findings for reaching a wellreasoned decision. Decisions made following analysis must be documentedto: provide a public record; facilitate public notification; explain therationale for selection of an action; and document the findings addressedabove at 5.31. The process depicted in exhibit 1 is not precise in eitherthe order or timing of events it predicts. Discretion must be used in determiningconsistency with and the need to change the forest plan. The followingis required. 1. In order to assure the responsible official and the public that allactions are consistent with the forest plan, a finding of consistency mustbe a part of each decision document. The finding must indicate consistencywith the general management requirements of the forest plan (36 CFR 2319.27),as well as indicating consistency with the specific standards and guidelines.This finding need not be lengthy or detailed, but should beiefly statewhy the proposed action is consistent with the particular management directionor requirements of law or regulation. The finding should include appropriatereferences to the pages in the forest plan, planning records, or environmentaldocuments used in making the consistency determination. This finding isan appealable decision (36 CFR 211.18). 2. In the case of a change to the forest plan that is determined not tobe significant, the Forest Supervisor documents the decision in the appropriatedocument and at the same time, if the activity is approved, amends theforest plan and implements the project or activity following appropriatepublic notification. Once the amendment is approved, permanently attacha copy of the amendment to all reference copies (36 CFR 219.6(i)(3)) ofthe forest plan. This finding is an appealable decision (36 CFR 211.18).3. In the case of a change to the forest plan that is determined to besignificant, follow the same procedure required for development of a forestplan (36 CFR 219.10(f)). Prepare a record of decision that accompaniesthe final environmental impact statement and address both the project andthe change to be made to the forest plan. The decision is appeable (36CFR 211.18) once the Regional Forester has signed the record of decision.When 45 days have elapsed since signing the record of decision, the forestplan is amended and the project or activity may be implemented. 4. Instructions for documentation necessary to comply with Forest Serviceenvironmental policies and procedures are found in FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15.<T3>5.5</T3>_<T3>BUDGET DEVELOPMENT. </T3>The selected projects and actions are thebasis for program budget development. Policy contained in FSM 1930.3 requiresthat budget proposals be consistent with long-range direction providedby, among others, the forest plan. Follow procedures established in FSH1909.13, The Program Development and Budgeting Handbook, for budget development.<T3>5.6</T3>_<T3>PROJECT DESIGN. </T3>Project design is a process for developing detailedproject plans, specifications, instructions, and cost estimates for selectedactions. During field work for project design, mitigating measures directedby environmental analysis must be incorporated. <T3>5.7</T3>_<T3>PROJECT EXECUTION AND ADMINISTRATION. </T3>Administer project executionto ensure that projects are completed as designed. Document any changesmade during execution to ensure there is a complete project history. Usemonitoring and evaluation techniques described in chapter 6 to providefeedback on forest plan implementation.

Monitoring collects information, on a sample basis, fromsources specified in the forest plan. Evaluation of monitoring resultsis used to determine the effectiveness of the forest plan and the needto either change the plan through amendment or revision or to continuewith the plan. This chapter establishes procedural guidance for monitoringand evaluating forest plans. Overall direction is found in FSM 1922.7 and36 CFR 219.12(k). <T3>6.02_Objectives.</T3> The overall objective of monitoring and evaluatingforest plans is to determine whether programs and projects are meetingforest plan direction. Within this broad objective, specific goals areto: 1. Ensure that forest plan goals and objectives are being achieved andmanagement prescriptions are being implemented as directed. 2. Determine if the costs of implementing the plan and the management effectsare occurring as predicted. <T3>6.03_Policy</T3> 1. Ensure that the intensity of monitoring is commensurate with the risks,costs, and values involved in meeting plan objectives through resourcemanagement. 2.

These levels are defined in FSM 1922.7. Exhibit 1 providesexamples of each level.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 166</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-C</ITAG><T3>6.11_Implementation Monitoring. </T3>Forest and Ranger District personnelconduct implementation monitoring as part of their routine assignmentsand document the results in project files as part of their management responsibilities.Use implementation monitoring to determine if plans, prescriptions, projects,and activities are implemented as designed and in compliance with forestplan objectives and standards and guidelines. <T3>6.12_Effectiveness Monitoring. </T3>Effectiveness monitoring determinesif plans, prescriptions, projects, and activities are effective in meetingmanagement direction, objectives, and the standards and guidelines. Thislevel of monitoring is conducted by resource and/or technical specialistson a limited basis as determined by resource values and risks, and publicissues. Begin effectiveness monitoring only after determining that theplan, prescription, project, or activity to be monitored has been implementedaccording to the plan's direction. <T3>6.13_Validation Monitoring. </T3>Validation monitoring determines whetherthe initial data, assumptions, and coefficients used in development ofthe plan are correct; or if there is a better way to meet forest planningregulations, policies, goals, and objectives. Conduct validation monitoringwhen effectiveness monitoring results indicate basic assumptions or coefficientsare questionable. Generally, conduct validation monitoring by establishingpermanent plots or studies in close coordination with research personnel.Limit the scope of validation monitoring to those coefficients and standardsthat are not reasonably substantiated by existing research. <T3>6.2_MONITORING REQUIREMENTS </T3><T3>6.21_Monitoring Required by NFMA Regulations. </T3>The planning regulationsat 36 CFR Part 219 require monitoring to: 1. Compare planned versus applied management standards and guidelines todetermine if objectives are achieved (36 CFR 219.12(k)). 2. Quantitatively compare planned versus actual outputs and services (36CFR 219.12(k)(1)). 3. Measure effects of prescriptions, including significant changes in landproductivity (36 CFR 219.12(k)(2)). 4. Determine planned cost versus actual costs associated with carryingout prescriptions (36 CFR 219.12(k)(3)). 5. Determine population trends of the management indicator species andrelationship to habitat changes (36 CFR 219.19(a)(6)). 6. Evaluate effects of National Forest management on adjacent land, resources,and communities (36 CFR 219.7(f)). 7. Identify research needs to support or improve National Forest management36 CFR 219.28). 8. Determine if lands are adequately restocked (36 CFR 219.12(k)(5)(i)).9. Determine, at least every ten years, if lands identified as unsuitablefor timber production have become suitable (36 CFR 219.12(k)(5)(ii). 10. Determine whether maximum size limits for harvest areas should be continued(36 CFR 219.12(k)(5)(iii)). 11. Ensure that destructive insects and disease organisms do not increaseto potentially damaging levels following management activities (36 CFR219.12(k)(5)(iv)). <T3>6.3_EVALUATION OF MONITORING RESULTS. </T3>Monitoring and evaluationare separate, sequential tasks. Monitoring is designed to observe and recordthe results of both natural processes and actions permitted by forest landand resource management plans. Evaluation looks at those results, determineshow well those results meet forest plan direction, and identifies measuresto keep the plan viable. <T3>6.31_Evaluation Techniques. </T3>Use a full spectrum of techniquesand methods to evaluate the results obtained from monitoring. Evaluationtechniques include but are not limited to:1. Site-specific observations by on-site resource specialists. 2. Field assistance trips by other technical specialists. 3. General field observations by Forest Service officials. 4. On-going accomplishment reporting processes such as PAMARS. 5. Formal management reviews on a scheduled basis. 6. Discussions with other agencies and the public users. 7. Management team review of monitoring results. 8. Interdisciplinary team reviews of monitoring results. 9. Involvement with existing research activities. 10. Review and analysis of records documenting monitoring results. <T3>6.32_Evaluation in Relation to the Three Monitoring Levels. </T3> Exhibit1 displays the process for evaluating monitoring results from each monitoringlevel. There is a direct, sequential relationship between the levels. Thisrelationship is designed to focus initial attention at the implementationmonitoring phase. The approved forest plan represents the most appropriate,current management direction; therefore, first ensure that it is implementedas designed. Needless expense and confusion may result by going directlyto effectiveness or validation monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Inser illusitration(s) 3 170</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-C</ITAG><T3>6.32a_Implementation Monitoring Results.</T3> Evaluation of the resultsof implementation monitoring indicate whether implementation of a projector activity is consistent with the forest plan.1.

If compliance is not feasible, either change theactivity or follow the forest plan amendment procedures described in chapter5.2. If implementation is consistent with the plan, determine if the originalplanning issues, concerns, or opportunities (ICO's) are still unresolvedor if new ICO's have developed. If there are no ICO's or they are of minorconsequence, continue implementation monitoring. If ICO's exist, begineffectiveness monitoring. <T3>6.32b_Effectiveness Monitoring Results.</T3> Evaluation of the resultsof effectiveness monitoring indicate whether plans, prescriptions, projects,or activities are effective in meeting management direction, objectives,and the standards and guidelines. 1. If results indicate the initial action implemented was the most effectiveand the ICO's have been resolved; document the evaluation and continueimplementation monitoring.2. Even though ICO's have been resolved, the results of effectiveness monitoringmay identify a different, more effective action that needs to be takenand the plan requires change. Follow the plan amendment procedures in chapter5 and continue implementation monitoring.3. If results indicate the most effective action was not taken or the ICO'shave not been resolved, estimate if the basic assumptions and coefficientsused in development of the plan are reasonable. If they appear reasonable,continue effectiveness monitoring. If the basic assumptions or coefficientsappear questionable, begin validation monitoring.<T3>6.32c_Validation Monitoring Results.</T3> Evaluation of the resultsof validation monitoring indicate whether initial data, assumptions, andcoefficients used in development of the plan are correct, or if there isa better way to meet forest planning regulations, policies, goals, andobjectives.1. If results indicate initial assumptions and coefficients are valid,document the evaluation and continue effectiveness monitoring.2. If ICO's have been resolved but the results of validation monitoringindicate a change in the basic assumptions or coefficients is needed, theplan may require change. Follow the plan amendment procedures in chapter5 and continue implementation monitoring.3. If results indicate assumptions and coefficients are still questionableand the ICO's have not been resolved, continue validation monitoring.<T3>6.33_New Assumptions, Coefficients, or External Changes.</T3> It maybe necessary to initiate monitoring at the effectiveness or validationlevel, rather than at the implementation level, when either a conditiondevelops that is uncontrollable under the current management situationor a change is expressly directed. Examples include:1. Changes in laws, regulations, or direction.2. Major changes in the resource base.3. Major economic changes, both local and regional.4. Fundamental changes in the basic data, assumptions, and coefficientsdue to proven results of research.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-15751 Filed 7-14-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
