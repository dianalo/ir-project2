When it entered Wisconsin in 1984, it went head to head with such popular home-state brewers as Miller and G. Heileman and managed to eke out only a 3% market share. Then last year in Michigan, it faced aggressive boycotts by labor groups that branded the company as anti-union.    But nowhere are the stakes richer and the marketing challenges tougher than in Coors's latest target states of New York and New Jersey. Together, the two states account for 10% of annual U.S. beer sales, enough to fill over 17 million, 31-gallon barrels. &quot;We've waited on New York because of the massive distribution effort involved,&quot; says Gary Truitt, vice president of international marketing. &quot;We wanted to be sure we could do it.&quot; This week, the company's draft beers finally start flowing in taverns, and by April six-packs will be on sale in stores. The New York entry, which coincides with the start-up of a $120 million packaging plant in Virginia, has been planned since fall 1985.    THE BALLYHOOED MOVE into New York seems a bit anti-climactic, though, since Coors has lost some of its cachet with beer drinkers. Back in the 1970s, people who journeyed out West often took the Rocky Mountain brew home as a sort of souvenir. But it hardly qualifies as a rare and coveted commodity now that it's available everywhere except Pennsylvania, Delaware and Indiana. &quot;Some consumers still perceive Coors as lighter and purer than other beers,&quot; says Al Ries, chairman of the Trout andamp; Ries ad agency. &quot;But it no longer has its mystique. Coors looks just like all the other brewers with a regular beer and a light version.&quot;    Shooting for 8% to 10% of the New York-New Jersey market, Coors will barrel in armed with $25 million for advertising, promotions and public relations. For starters, it will air three special introductory TV commercials showing such familiar landmarks as Niagara Falls and the Atlantic City boardwalk. In June, it will switch to its national ad campaigns -- actor Mark Harmon plugging Coors and the Silver Bullet Bar series for Coors Light.    The company has surprised some beer-industry veterans with its distribution strategy for the five New York City boroughs and surrounding counties. Instead of copying its competitors and having several beer wholesalers serve New York, Coors picked only one distributor, and its choice, curiously enough, was a Canada Dry softdrink bottler. &quot;We saw a need for a unified merchandising effort under one house, and Canada Dry has a reputation for being hard-charging,&quot; says Terry Nauslar, director of market expansion.    UNDOUBTEDLY, Coors will move lots of beer its first six months in New York and New Jersey. The hard part comes once the novelty wears off and the marketing blitz subsides.    Competitors have clashed with Coors in other states and are well-versed in defending their market shares. Says Alan Easton, a spokesman for Miller Brewing Co.: &quot;We'll offer our distributors a whole smorgasboard of sweepstakes, refunds and other incentives to hold on to Miller customers who are tempted to try Coors.&quot;    Rival beer marketers aren't Coors's only worry. The company will try to appeal to a large number of blacks, Hispanics and union members, groups with whom it has had stormy relationships. Already, the New York AFL-CIO has called on its members to boycott Coors. It also will pass out leaflets accusing Coors of union-busting and will discourage taverns and stores from carrying the beer. To try to blunt the boycott, Coors is contacting local reporters this week and urging them to include its viewpoint in any stories they write. In addition, the company is warning stores and bars of possible trouble. &quot;Bar owners have become upset in other states and gotten into fights with pickets,&quot; says spokeswoman Cary Baird. &quot;That kind of publicity makes people wonder about Coors.&quot;    Fewer problems are anticipated from blacks and Hispanics. They ended a Coors boycott in 1984, when the company agreed to recruit more black and Hispanic employees and do business with more minority-owned companies. To build a good-neighbor image and woo minority customers in the New York area, Coors will donate money to the Urban League, sponsor a black-cowboy rodeo and lend support to a Puerto Rican theater troupe and program for the homeless.    COORS HAS BEEN ROLLING out its beer a few states at a time since 1981, and sometimes this piecemeal expansion    results in marketing glitches. For example, sales may growmore slowly in southern New Jersey because consumers therewon't see any Coors ads on TV. They watch Philadelphiastations, and Coors has yet to sell its brands inPennsylvania.   But for the most part, the gradual expansion has been a beneficial learning experience. For example, Coors believes sales in the Southeast would be stronger now if it had hired a public-relations firm to keep hyping the beer after the introductory hoopla ended. So this time, not only is it retaining a New York PR agency, it also is moving a member of its corporate PR staff to New Jersey.    Coors also will stress &quot;micro-marketing&quot; in the New York area more than it did elsewhere. It has plotted a half-dozen marketing strategies, custom tailored to different parts of New York and New Jersey. For instance, Coors is counting on rugged competition from the lower-priced Genesee brand in northern New York. &quot;Genesee employs local people in Rochester, so there's a lot of loyalty,&quot; Mr. Nauslar notes. &quot;Price is also very important to upstate consumers, so we'll have to be quite aggressive up there with promotions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
