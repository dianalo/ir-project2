 In the past I've run IV programs and then had to use acrowbar to remove users from the IV workstation, so I know they really canbecome addictive.andM;In essence, IV allows you to combine the interactive nature of computerprograms with the high quality of video images.andP;  Imagine a computer gamewhich allows you to wander around in a castle, choosing which rooms to enterand which objects to pick up.andP;  This is the 'interactive' part.andP;  Now imaginethat you see video quality pictures of a real castle with real rooms, but youcan still wander around, deciding which doors to pass through.andP;  That'sinteractive video.andM;An important part of IV is the video disc player.andP;  Attaching such a player toa micro allows rapid access to 55,000 high-quality, full-colour images.andP;  Allframes have unique addresses, so they can be accessed in any order orsequence.andM;These frames can be likened to a huge datastore, and a suitable databasepackage on the micro can draw still images from that store.andP;  However, IV ismuch more powerful than that.andP;  The micro can call up these video frames atthe rate of 25 per second, so moving images can be presented to users.andM;Changing the endingandM;Not only that, but suppose you're watching a drama filmed with twoalternative endings.andP;  At a crucial point in the action you could be asked todecide what a particular character should do.andP;  Depending on your choice,you'd then see one of the two possible endings.andP;  In practice, there's no needto limit users' interaction to a single decision.andP;  Instead, viewers can makemultiple decisions and effectively control the drama which then unfolds.andM;It's important to realize that it's the micro-computer attached to the videodisc player which provides the 'interactive' part of IV.andP;  A computer programmight cause the words:andM;'Should John accept Melissa's apparently innocent invitation to a quick gameof indoor-underwater-powerboat-snooker?'andM;to appear on the screen.andP;  If users select Yes, then it's the computer programwhich looks after the fact that frames 25,453 to 28,342 are to be played,rather than frames 28,343 to 29,444.andM;The output from the computer and the video player is normally mixed on to onescreen.andP;  It's possible to mix computer-generated and video images, overlayingone on another.andM;The Doomsday disc is a good example of IV.andP;  Another example is less wellknown, but remains a classic example of well-designed IV, exploiting the fullpotential of the medium.andP;  Called 'Night Call', it was produced by AdvancedMedical Communication for ICI and is designed to teach medical students howto diagnose and treat heart attacks.andM;Medical 'interaction'andM;Night Call opens with you, a GP, receiving a telephone call in the middle ofnight.andP;  On the other end of the phone is the wife of a man who has chestpains.andP;  You must ask her the correct questions in order to make thediagnosis.andP;  If you decide to visit the patient, you need to pack your bagwith the correct equipment.andP;  If you leave out anything vital, it won't bethere when you need it.andM;At the patient's house you can examine him, take his blood pressure, listento his heart and so on.andP;  Eventually you should have enough information tomake a final diagnosis and begin treatment.andP;  A nice touch is that the programexecution is timed, so you can't afford to be tardy - just like real life.andM;The program was written in BBC Basic and makes use of Basic's excellentstring handling capabilities to analyse text input.andP;  This means that it canaccept rather vague instructions like 'Take the blood pressure' and show thevideo sequence of the blood pressure being taken.andM;Not all heart attacks are the same, and by making use of random numbergeneration the program is able to present users with seven or eight broadlydifferent scenarios.andP;  Within each of those, the patient's generalphysiological condition can vary, so the response to the same drug can differeach time the program is run.andP;  In effect, a physiological model of thepatient has been constructed within the computer program, and this modelchanges slightly each time it's used.andM;Like all good tools, the uses for IV keep increasing as you learn more of itsstrengths.andP;  IV is a solution for which multiple problems already exist.andM;For instance, imagine selling a car by letting your customers choose all thecolour, upholstery, engine and trim options, gradually building the car oftheir dreams on screen.andM;In the travel agent's you can visit several holiday locations.andP;  Since you cancontrol the direction in which the 'walkabout' proceeds, you can go and seeif your hotel has actually been built!andM;In addition, the possibilities for games are mind-blowing, especially whencombined with the other facets of multi-media.andM;Staff training has already proved very cost-effective with IV.andP;  Theinteractive nature of the material allows trainees to proceed through thematerial at their own pace, and repeat sections they find difficult.andP;  Shellhas about 50 IV stations around the world and, in conjunction with severaloutside firms, develops its own in-house training IVs.andM;HardwareandM;Interactive video hardware consists of a video disc player, a genlock board,a monitor and a microcomputer to control the whole lot.andM;The video disc player is like a grown-up CD player, playing 30cm discs.andP;  Aswell as 55,000 video frames, there's enough room left on the disc to providea full-stereo soundtrack as well.andP;  (It's also possible to store thecontrolling computer program on the video disc, but this is by no meansobligatory.)andM;The access time to find a given frame is slow in computing terms (maximumseek time of about 3 seconds), but then it's seeking across more than 50Gb ofdata.andP;  Clearly, frames placed close together have a much more rapid accesstime - so rapid that you can't see the join.andP;  CD-sized players are on theway, but at present most systems use the 30cm discs.andM;A genlock board is a card which fits into one of the slots of the micro.andP;  Thevideo output from the video player and the VGA (or EGA and so on) output fromthe micro are both fed into the card.andP;  Here they're mixed and the combinedsignal is sent to the monitor.andM;The micro can put text and graphics on the screen.andP;  In addition, it cancontrol access to the images on the video disc, calling them up in anyrequired sequence.andP;  A well-written computer program can mix computer graphicson top of video disc images, a process which can produce astonishing effects.andM;A touch screen can also be very useful in situations where prospective userslack keyboard skills.andP;  In addition, it provides an intuitive interface towhat is essentially a very visual medium.andP;  It allows user interactions like:'Touch the model of car that you'd like to own, and we can have a look at itin more detail.'andM;IV workstationsandM;Several companies market complete IV workstations, notably Microvitec, whichhas just announced the 'Insight Low Profile Video System'.andP;  In the early daysI cobbled together all the parts necessary to make an IV station, but unlessyou're an enthusiast it's almost certainly better to buy a pre-built system.andM;Once you have the hardware, you only need a video disc with the right imageson it, and the software which can control that disc and interact with users.andO;Bear in mind that the video disc can be thought of just as a huge store ofinformation which is accessed by the software.andP;  Given a single video disc andseveral different pieces of software, it's perfectly possible to produceseveral totally different IV programs.andP;  The IV programs wouldn't even have tobe on the same subject.andP;  It all depends which frames from the video disc areaccessed by the software, and in which order.andM;Buying or hiringandM;It's possible to buy or hire a complete package of disc, software andsupporting material from one of several different companies.andP;  The advantageof this is that you can get the material quickly and cheaply.andP;  Thedisadvantage is that the package may not be exactly what you want.andP;  Thepeople who produce material of this type tend to make it as general aspossible; that is, they produce IVs on topics like 'Develop a good telephonemanner' or 'Close that sale'.andP;  If this is what you want, it's probably muchbetter to hire the IV package, and quite possibly the hardware as well.andM;If you really do need a custom-made piece of IV, you can still make use of acommercially produced video disc.andP;  If, for example, you're a travel agentwishing to promote travel to Greece, then any video disc with panoramic shotsof Greece might serve your purposes.andM;The big advantage of using an existing disc is cost.andP;  A commercially producedvideo disc can cost as little as 50 pound sterling; video discs can often behired at reasonable daily rates.andM;The disadvantage is that discs like this may not have all of the materialthat you really want on them.andP;  It's here that the power of IV comes to youraid.andP;  Suppose that most of the disc is irrelevant to your needs, but frames23422 to 28445 and 43222 to 47334 are exactly what you need.andP;  As long as thecomputer program accesses only these frames, all is well: users see only thematerial you want them to see.andP;  Some discs are simply huge stores of slidesand short clips of related information.andP;  There's a whole video disc devotedto the knee!andP;  A disc like this can be used by several different computerprograms to produce several different IV programs.andM;If all else fails, you can consider having your own material put on disc, butthis is where the expense starts to mount up.andM;Producing your own disc means that the material you want will be firstcollected on another medium (usually video tape), edited, and the finalresult transferred to video disc.andP;  In principle there's nothing to stop youtaping the scenes you require on home video equipment.andP;  In practice, thequality may be such that the results are unimpressive.andP;  If your firm has anin-house video team, consider using it.andM;Commercial companies exist which will look after some or all of the aspectsof producing a video disc for you, but they tend to be expensive.andM;Once the material for the disc is assembled, the video disc must be cut.andO;Again, there are several ways of proceeding.andM;You can have a one-off disc cut at a cost of between 395 pound sterling and595 pound sterling.andP;  Glass gives better quality, but acrylic is fine forchecking the contents of the disc.andP;  With either medium, subsequent copieswill cost about the same as the first, although a discount system usuallyoperates.andP;  If you're considering a batch, then producing a master disc is agood alternative.andP;  This will cost somewhere between 2,750 pound sterling and4,000 pound sterling, but each copy of the disc then costs only about 44pound sterling.andP;  If you intend running off more than about 15 discs, thenit's probably worth mastering.andM;Given that you have the hardware and a suitable video disc, you still need acomputer program to control the video player and the user interface.andP;  Thiscan be developed in either a conventional language (such as Pascal or C) orby using a so-called authoring language or authoring system.andM;Authoring systemsandM;Authoring systems are advertised as easy to use, but can lack the ability toallow fine control of the IV program.andP;  For example, the physiologicalmodelling in Night Call, easy in Basic, would be impossible to reproduce withmost authoring systems.andM;The majority of firms producing IV software for a living use conventionallanguages.andP;  There are so-called 'toolboxes' available which make it mucheasier to use conventional languages for IV work.andM;Using a conventional language is much easier than it used to be.andP;  Just howeasy was brought home to me last year when I watched a group ofschoolchildren at the North Bradford Commonwealth Enterprise Centre.andP;  In asingle day they learnt enough Pascal to enable them to plan, write and debuga piece of IV software using a Pascal toolbox.andP;  The IV piece was then used asa demonstration piece for the opening of the Centre that evening.andM;The total costs of producing IV can very enormously.andP;  If you film ityourself, make a single glass disc and write the software yourself, the totalbudget can be under 1,000 pound sterling.andP;  If you have it made byprofessionals, a custom-made, totally interactive video for staff trainingmight cost in the order of 120,000 pound sterling to 200,000 pound sterling.andO;The time to produce it will vary between 3 months and a year.andM;It may be that, unlike a video, IV allows users to see only the things thatthey ask to see; by definition this should be less boring.andP;  In addition, theconstant interaction in which they must participate also tends to keep theuser's attention focused in a manner that straight video cannot.andM;A second reason may be that people are used to watching video images; theyalso tend to believe what they see on the screen.andP;  If medical studentsadminister an inappropriate treatment in Night Call, the patient dies infront of their very eyes.andP;  Watching a person die as a result of your mistaketends to ram the message home more forcefully than simply losing 5 marks in atest.andM;In the same way, IV can be used to convince your target audience that yourmessage is right.andP;  'It's true, car X is better.andP;  I set up the raceconditions, I even gave the opposition bigger engines and I still saw car Xcross the finishing line first.'andM;If anything, I believe that well-written IV is almost too powerful as a tool.andO;Sometimes, in my darker moments, I see the shadow of George Orwell over myshoulder.andP;  In my lighter moments, I think it's a gas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
