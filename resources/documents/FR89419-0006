This amendmentrequires additional maintenance actions and changes to some of the repetitiveinspection intervals, and would provide an alternate means of compliancewhich terminates the need for the repetitive inspection. This amendmentis prompted by further assessment of components associated with the mainlanding gear support beams, which identified the need for additional maintenancerequirements. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to collapseof the main landing gear.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom British Aerospace PLC, Librarian for Service Bulletin, P.O.

Due consideration has been given to the singlecomment received.The commenter supported the proposal.After careful review of the available data, including the comment notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule as proposed.It is estimated that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by thisAD, that it will take approximately 60 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $4,800. (the cost for the optional new main supportbeam is estimated to be $90,000 per airplane.)The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities, becausefew, if any, Model BAC 1-11 series airplanes are operated by small entities.A final evaluation has been prepared for this regulation and has been placedin the Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection;39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
