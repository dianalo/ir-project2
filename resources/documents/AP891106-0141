(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four inmates filed a lawsuit Monday overthe use of handcuffs and shackles at the riot-torn Camp Hill stateprison, contending that inmates there are being inhumanely treated.   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court by the AmericanCivil Liberties Union on behalf of the inmates whose families hadasked the ACLU for for help. Named as defendant was David S. OwensJr., commissioner of the state Corrections Department.   Judge Sylvia Rambo scheduled a hearing for Tuesday and orderedthe state to bring the four inmates to the federal building in themorning so they can meet with their lawyer and be called aswitnesses in the hearing.   ACLU legal director Stefan Presser asked the court for arestraining order that would force the department to removehandcuffs and shackles from inmates and would allow the prisonersto meet with their lawyers.   In his petition, Presser said more than 1,000 inmates, some cladonly in underwear, remained shackled in pairs inside cells. Many ofthe inmates have been held that way since two nights of rioting atthe prison ended Oct. 27.   ``I think it's torture. We do not treat animals this way,''Presser said.   The fiery rioting left more than a dozen buildings destroyed atthe prison five miles west of Harrisburg. Thirteen prison staffersls repeatedlyabout the wisdom of using contractlabor.   ``We are dealing with complexes of enormous potential danger ...and instead of trying to build a stable workforce under onemanagement, providing them with uniform procedures of training,evacuation, safety, etc., you're sort of pulling in people throughcontracting outfits at a dollar savings, but potentially at a veryhigh cost in human lives,'' Lantos said.   ``You're not dealing here with a catering operation. We aredealing with life-threatening materials in enormous quantities.''   Glenn A. Cox, president and chief operating officer of theBartlesville, Okla.-based company, said the facts of the accident``speak very clearly'' to the question of how Phillips staffs itsplants.   ``One of the key questions we have to address is how, in fact,work is assigned _ who does work _ to make certain there is not acompromise in safety in these facilities,'' Cox said.   In addition to 19 confirmed dead, four people are missing andsix remain hospitalized. More than 100 others were injured in theexplosion that hurtled debris up to six miles.</TEXT></DOC>
