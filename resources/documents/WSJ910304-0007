In this case, it is very beautiful music too. &quot;Katya&quot;dates to those feverish winter years when Janacek composed somany of his greatest works. A young water sprite he met at aMoravian spa in 1918, Kamila Stoessl, had cast a spell onhim. His wife-blighted life became sunny, his music radiant.There is something quite amazing and wonderful about thesudden burst of creativity that added three splendid musicdramas to our repertoire: &quot;The Makropolos Affair,&quot; &quot;TheCunning Little Vixen,&quot; and, perhaps most importantly,&quot;Katya,&quot; which he wrote while thinking of Kamila, who was 40years his junior.</LP><TEXT>   For all that, &quot;Katya&quot; is quite a dark work, only brieflyilluminated by the hopeless passion Katya conceives for aneighbor who is only marginally more appealing than herhusband. Janacek based his opera on a play by the Russianrealist, Alexander Ostrovsky, which chronicles a stiflinghousehold ruled like a serf colony by a terrifyingmother-in-law.   &quot;Down, down]&quot; Kabanicha sings sternly to her son, pointingto the ground as he nervously bids her goodbye to go shoppingin Kazan. &quot;Don't kiss him like a lover]&quot; she yells at Katyaafter she has dutifully embraced her husband as she wasordered to do. Though intended as a picture of generationalconflicts in the mid-19th century, the piece plays prettywell nowadays. Pathological behavior never dates.   &quot;Thanks a lot for your kind services,&quot; Kabanicha says tosome neighbors who fish Katya's corpse out of the Volga. Allthrough the opera, we hear the mighty river flowing in thebackground, personified in the last scene by an offstagehumming chorus that beckons the distraught Katya into itsdepths.   There were times when I wished that it were flowing morevisibly through the production, too. Katya throws herselfinto a dark ditch very far upstage. This is meant to be theVolga, but it makes for a very understated symbol ofpurification-through-drowning. But then, I imagined the sameriver teeming with little boats and lofty bridges, its bankslined with strollers, ballbouncing boys and a cartwheelingtroupe of clowns in the manner of Harry Kupfer, FrancoZeffirelli or the DREAD Piero Faggioni, and I decided I couldlive with the ditch.   In other ways, the production goes far to convey thefeeling of oppression that only lifts with the happinessKatya finds in her garden trysts with Boris. And even thathappiness is an illusion, very much so, in fact, in thisproduction, which also dispenses with the garden. Not even abirch tree] Did Messrs. Israel and Miller purposefully setout to wean us from the highcal fare of the big-bucks boys?   The first scene is the exterior of the Kabanov house, awhite clapboard structure very stark and faintly Vermont infeel. In the background are two strange, toylike buildings, ared tower and a green Palladian mansion seen across a vast,empty space. Black and white are the dominant colors allevening and an eerie loneliness the dominant mood. I must saythat I would never have thought there was much connectionbetween the surrealist streetscapes of Giorgio de Chirico orAndy Wyeth's cottages and some lost souls in rural Russia,but in a considerable leap of the imagination, Mr. Israeldoes make it seem so.   Claustrophobia becomes palpable in the tiny living roomwhere Katya sings of her shackled life. The cold, bleak rainfalling silently on the house where Katya suddenly collapsesfrom the strain and confesses publicly to adultery extendsits chill into the audience.   Never does Mr. Miller inflate the story beyond itsdomestic scale into the epic tragedy it is not. His directionis finely tuned to the talents of his excellent cast, led byGabriela Benackova, who was also making her belated Metdebut. What an appealing performer she is, a soprano whobrings such fervid commitment to her role that she actuallyseemed to glow in the dark. (Even so, could there not be alittle more light on the stage now and again?) I cannot thinkof anyone who sings with such a seamlessly opulent soprano.This is the most ravishing voice in the world. Her name, bythe way, does not appear on next year's Met roster. The Metis a mysterious place.   That her lover was played by Wieslaw Ochman, a short tenornot quite in the first flush of youth, added pathos to theromance. He was affecting saying goodbye to Katya, shuffling,sheepish, holding on to the bowler hat that hid his stringyhair.   Hypnotic not only in these poignant pages of leavetaking,the music requires a conductor both ardent and precise, andwe had such a man in Charles Mackerras. Not always do we hearsuch gorgeous playing from the orchestra -- or such cheersfrom an audience even before the downbeat. &quot;Katya&quot; is onlysome 90 minutes long, but Mr. Mackerras gave it pace andspace to unfold.   Short as it may be, &quot;Katya&quot; is nevertheless filled withsharp vignettes and (for opera) roundly rendered characters.There is Dikoj, Kabanicha's match in greed and nastiness, towhich the hulking Aage Haugland, in a marvelous cameo, addeda few layers of booze-soaked blubber. There is also a secondset of lovers, Varvara and Kudrjas, who slip out fromunderneath Kabanicha's claws singing Chekovian paeans toMoscow. Susan Quittmeyer and Peter Straka, in his verypromising Met debut, turned them into lively characters. Andit was nice to see Allan Glassman singing strongly as hefussed with his glasses as the hopeless husband, Tichon.   In such fine company, Leonie Rysanek nearly walked awaywith the show. Kabanicha is one of her signature roles now asshe speeds cheerfully into her seventh decade, and she fairlythrobbed from the pentup venom pulsing through her veins.Fuming underneath a huge black hat embellished with a bowthat looked like bat wings, she was magnificent in herghastliness.</TEXT></DOC>
