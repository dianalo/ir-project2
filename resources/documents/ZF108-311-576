 This product line will include caller number ID and digitalmessaging devices for the upscale consumer.andM;As usual, the CEO wants these products developed fast, and he wants themcheap.andP;  He is willing to add some engineers to the staff, but the MIS managerknows from experience that the CEO will not spend a lot of money on support.andM;Chipskate's MIS manager turns to DEC, his usual supplier, for the 20additional workstations he will need.andP;  The total price for 20 VAXstation3100s comes to $450,000.andM;Chipskate's MIS manager realizes that if he were willing to go to a Uniximplementation, he could get extra power by purchasing RISC/Unixworkstations.andP;  By purchasing DECstation 2100s instead of VAXstations, hefigures he will spend the same amount for hardware but the DECstations willprovide about three times the speed of the VAXstations.andM;But Chipskate still runs a VMS shop, and the switch to Unix will entail someadditional costs.andP;  First of all, the MIS manager must purchase software toenable the VMS and Unix computers to coexist, and he does this by purchasingVAX software that will provide TCP/IP connectivity for $14,000, NFScompatibility for $4,000 and data translation capability for $2,000.andP;  Inaddition, he will need Unix-based CAE software.andP;  All told, this comes to$100,000 in software expenditures.andP;  Fortunately, Chipskate's networks arerunning well within capacity and will not require changes to keep up with theincreased demand.andM;So the difference between staying with VMS and moving to Unix is the cost ofthe additional software that Unix will require.andP;  But the gains in processingspeed provided by the DECstations will result in productivity savings aswell.andP;  The MIS manager realizes that by moving to the DECstation the companycan reduce its manpower requirements by two engineers, saving both the costof their workstations and their $45,000 salaries.andP;  This amounts to a $560,880savings over a five-year period.andM;His total after-tax income on the deal comes to $370,181, with a positivecash flow by the third year.andP;  So, after discounting his cumulative cash flowby a standard 11 percent, the MIS manager determines that the switch to Unixwill amount to a $88,069 savings for Chipskate.andM;In addition, the initial step to Unix today will provide the foundation forincreasing Unix use throughout the company tomorrow, a trend the MIS managerwants to encourage.andM;Unix, the operating system created on a PDP-7, is riding a wave of popularitythat MIS managers can ignore only at their own peril.andP;  In many camps, usersare clamoring for the blindingly fast compute speed of RISC/Unix computersand the superior graphics capabilities of RISC/Unix workstations.andM;These users' demands are easy to cost-justify because RISC/Unix platformsprovide greater horsepower at a lower cost than their CISC-based VMScounterparts.andP;  But there are some serious hurdles to be overcome whenintegrating a VAX/VMS shop with a Unix environment.andM;The huge existing investment in VMS-based software is not likely to roll overinto a Unix environment on a wholesale scale.andP;  The millions of dollars andyears of manpower needed to accomplish a complete conversion would beprohibitively expensive for most companies.andP;  In fact, according to someanalysts, it's probably more cost-effective for a VMS shop to migrate to thenew VAX 9000, the mainframe-class VAX, than to transfer a company's entiresoftware base from VMS to Unix.andM;The move to Unix can be successful only if Unix is integrated with existinghardware and software investments through tools that enable the two operatingsystems to share one network.andP;  This is the approach that many users areplanning to follow: A user study by Strategic Focus, a market researchcompany in Milpitas, Calif., found that in two years, 74 percent of the DECusers surveyed will have multivendor integrated networks compared with the 30percent who have such networks now.andM;The most fiscally appealing strategy is to begin integrating Unix intomainstream operations through networking and integration software that spansthe two systems' data-format and user-interface barriers.andP;  Thus, a companycan start exploiting the greater price/performance ratio of a RISC/Unixplatform without losing any existing investment in VMS software.andM;For starters, cost-justifying an approach that integrates Unix is as simpleas comparing hardware prices.andP;  With RISC/Unix MicroVAX II units of processing(MVUPs) running as low as $250 each, the exponentially more expensive VAXCISC MVUPs--jumping to near $25,000 per MVUP--have, on paper at least, becomeless attractive.andP;  RISC/Unix workstations also offer an average of 20 timesthe raw performance of PCs for about twice the price.andM;Within DEC's own product line, the price/performance difference between CISCand RISC is clear.andP;  Take the VAX 6000 Model 440, for example.andP;  The basesystem, with 35 to 40 MVUPs, is about $665,000.andP;  The same amount of CPU powercan be had from a DECsystem 5820, which shares a common XMI architecture, forroughly $215,000.andP;  At the workstation level, users can buy a fully configuredVAXstation 3100 Model 30 with eight-plane graphics and a 19-inch colormonitor for about $22,800.andP;  The same amount of money can buy a comparableDECstation 2100 with about three times the CPU power.andM;Among the advantages of the RISC/Unix purchase are the clear performanceimprovements that can translate into productivity gains.andP;  The increasedprocessing power of these systems, for example, results in faster codecompilation for software developers and more rapid data analysis and graphicsscreen generation for engineers.andP;  The extra power can also provide fastersearches and retrievals for database packages.andM;BEGINNING THE JOURNEYandM;An important element in the cost-effective implementation of a VMS-to-Unixstrategy is linking the platforms.andP;  This link lets data traverse the twooperating systems, eliminating the &quot;islands of automation&quot; that plagued MISsoon after the PC revolution a decade ago.andM;Simply increasing the available bandwidth is not sufficient for a successfulVMS-to-Unix migration.andP;  More attention to network planning will help toeliminate the bottlenecks that Unix workstations can create on a network.andP;  ARISC/Unix machine often increases network traffic: Because of the higherspeeds with which it processes data, it moves more data across the network ina shorter time frame.andM;Whereas DECnet and Local Area Transport are the lifeline of a VAX network,TCP/IP is the lifeline of a Unix network.andP;  To link the two operating systems,an MIS manager could put DECnet and LAT on the Unix boxes, or run TCP/IP onthe VAX.andM;To support both DEC's LAT and TCP/IP's Telnet requires LAT/Telnet servers forall the users who need to access VMS and Unix.andP;  As an alternative, all theLAT servers could be routed through a translating terminal server to connectthem to Telnet and Unix.andP;  But this approach can be expensive and causebottlenecks.andM;On the VAX/VMS side, the networking products that allow VMS to communicatevia the TCP/IP protocols and the de facto standard Network File System (NFS)range from $8,000 to $30,000; the NFS products vary from $3,000 to $9,000,depending on the size of the system and the number of users.andM;On the Unix side, connectivity with the LAT protocol can be had by Sun users,for example, at $1,195 for a 16-session license (not includingdocumentation).andP;  LAT host services can also be purchased for $750 to $2,500for 16-session to 64-session licenses.andP;  The LAT products are also availablefor many other Unix systems.andP;  Moreover, Unix systems in general have more CPUpower available to support the Telnet and LAT protocols.andM;Another connectivity option is an end-node implementation of DECnet for theUnix environment.andP;  It offers client and server remote-command terminalsupport and remote file access.andP;  A single-user version is priced at $1,200.andO;A high-end, multiuser version for minisupercomputers is $40,000.andM;Even though many of these connectivity products aren't expensive, usersshould be aware of hidden costs incurred by the larger amount of memory andprocessing power needed to support them.andM;Trouble caused by a network that can't handle the load due to the extraprocessing power can destroy any return on investment that might haveresulted from those extra CPU cycles.andP;  That was the case for an engineeringgroup of a large chip manufacturer, which incorporated Unix into its VMSshop.andM;The group chose Unix platforms because the faster processing power increasedproductivity by providing faster analyses and screen generation of designs.andO;The productivity bonus for these engineers alone added up to a 25 percentannual return on investment.andM;Nonetheless, because of the increased load that the Unix workstations put onthe network, the group discovered the machines were bogging down networkperformance.andP;  To keep up with the workstations' demands, the engineeringgroup was forced to expand its Ethernet network, at an extra cost of $750 pernode.andM;In spite of the higher networking costs of Unix, the chip manufacturerdetermined that ignoring the needs of its design engineers would have leftthe company at a distinct disadvantage.andP;  Its competition would probably scoopup as many cheap RISC/Unix boxes as it could, integrate them into itsenvironment and push chip designs out the door sooner.andM;CROSSING THE BORDERandM;It isn't only network bandwidth that can limit the integration of Unix into aVMS shop.andP;  In spite of an installation's ability to use TCP/IP, NFS or DECnetto cross the operating system borders, the differing data formats between thetwo can cause problems as well.andM;Unix has a simplified file structure of byte streams, whereas the RMS filesof VAX/VMS can arrive in any of several file types.andP;  Problems can abound, asthe Unix system is likely to interpret the RMS file header as part of thefile's data and not as a definition of the file's structure.andP;  The addition ofsoftware to provide data translation can streamline the process.andO;Furthermore, extra utilities can provide emulations for the DCL, EDT andsystem libraries of VMS.andM;Data translation packages move text and binary files over Ethernet,converting data, replicating file organization and smoothing over thedifferences in byte ordering and floating-point representations between thetwo operating systems, usually for a price between $1,000 and $5,000.andM;VMS emulation for the Unix environment can provide DCL commands as well asEDT and utilities emulation for about the same price as data translationpackages.andP;  Other software can also emulate the VAX/VMS system libraries for$3,500 to about $15,000.andM;VMS-like mail interfaces and backup products for Unix can also add to thecost of a VMS-to-Unix migration.andP;  For example, a backup package on a Sunmachine can vary from $1,495 for a Sun 386i to $4,995 for a Sparcserver 390.andO;On these same systems, a mail translation product can run anywhere from about$400 to $3,000.andM;For sites not choosing to use emulation tools, integrating Unix may requireretraining users.andP;  But this is not always the case, especially if the usersare scientifically or technically oriented.andP;  A Midwestern university reportedthat its users in the physics and engineering departments adjusted quickly toUnix, even though the central lab offered VMS emulation packages.andP;  Sometechnical users want the Unix-based applications so badly that they'll teachthemselves, asking only for minimal assistance from management.andM;It's likely that users who do need retraining are those who have becomeaccustomed to VMS and have no great desire to switch.andP;  But ways can be foundaround retraining.andP;  An X-windowing system or VMS emulation tools couldprovide a mask for a casual Unix user for whom extensive retraining would notbe cost effective.andM;Incorporating Unix may also require hiring a Unix systems administrator at asalary of $35,000 to $45,000.andP;  His or her job would likely involveinstallating Unix, managing the upgrades and networking, and trainingpersonnel.andP;  The position would probably not require a heavy-duty programmer.andM;For programming, management would have to consider hiring a Unix developmentmanager who would oversee applications development.andP;  The price tag for such aposition could range from $55,000 to $85,000.andM;ONCE-SACRED TURFandM;Few would question that Unix has had an impact on VAX/VMS.andP;  RISC-basedplatforms are sprouting up at VAX sites and are encroaching on once-sacredturf.andP;  The raw power and the relative openness of Unix is, for many, toocompelling to ignore.andM;In spite of the initial problems with incorporating Unix into a VMS world,there are advantages to be gained besides processing power.andP;  Unix users haveconsistently reported that they are more productive when they have access tofaster RISC/Unix systems.andP;  Design engineers, in particular, are happy to getas fast a response time as possible for their graphics-oriented applications.andM;Unix confers other benefits as well.andP;  Its prominence in colleges anduniversities has turned out many programmers and systems analysts who arefamiliar and comfortable with the operating system and its accompanyingprogramming environment.andP;  In the case of new employees for a company's MISshop, these entry-level people would require little retraining.andM;Along with the RISC/Unix boxes' increase in processing power per dollar comesan increasing number of applications.andP;  Unix databases, usually much lessexpensive than their VMS equivalents, are now commonplace.andP;  And though Unixstill has the best support in the technical and engineering fields, more andmore commercial word processing, spreadsheet and related applications arebeing ported to the Unix environment.andM;Unix's biggest drawback still is that software for it is not as portable asmany proponents claim.andP;  A recent study by the Aberdeen Group, a Boston marketresearch company, maintains that Unix-based applications are not likely toattain the binary compatibility common in the MS-DOS world within the nexttwo years.andP;  The study cites drawbacks such as the existence of many versionsof Unix and hardware architectures, and many size classes that run Unix.andM;Also, the VAX will have a continued presence because not all applicationswill need the horsepower of RISC systems.andP;  Large, centralized applicationssuch as accounting will continue to use the resources of VAX/VMS, forexample.andP;  Nor will every VMS user take to Unix like a duck to water.andP;  Theobvious trepidations about Unix are legion.andP;  It has a less-robust filesystem, for example; an unfriendly user interface; non-intuitive,less-than-mnemonic commands; data translation and binary conversion problems;and numerous Unix versions that cause application portability delays of twoto six months.andM;On the other hand, Unix offers a path to freedom to those under the tutelageof proprietary hardware and software.andP;  Because Unix is written in ahigh-level language, it is readily portable to the latest and greatesthardware architecture.andP;  And as Unix moves, so may the applications that runon the operating system.andP;  Having lasted for 20 years already, Unix in theoryprovides software with an application binary interface that will last for theforeseeable future.andM;In the meantime, a gradual move toward Unix makes more sense than a radicalmove that may result in a Pyrrhic victory.andP;  A quick move might be technicallycorrect, but it could be a financial disaster, running up expenses anddepleting resources that eventually could sink a business.andP;  In short, it isbetter to wade into Unix slowly than it is to run aground on an operatingsystem sandbar.andM;Migration to Unix is not always an easy moveandM;As the cost of RISC-based processing power continues to drop, Unix is gainingground outside of its traditional stronghold of engineering, research andprogramming.andP;  Some sites have made the move to Unix out of desperation formore power; others have grasped the benefits in spite of a hurdle or twoalong the way.andP;  In fact, one director of system services described his firstgo-around with Unix-based workstations as positively painful.andM;Nonetheless, the financial benefits of RISC/Unix and the improvedconnectivity options that have become available mean that the Unix option issaid Michael Jensen, director of system services at Sundstrand Power Systemsof San Diego.andP;  Sundstrand manufactures gas turbine auxiliary power units andaircraft environmental-control systems.andM;The first set of workstations--three Apollo 3500 systems running Aegis, aUnix derivative--was purchased to run Intercap illustration software fromIntercard Graphics Systems of Annapolis, Md.andM;The workstations were plagued by network-integration and file-transferproblems.andP;  The VAX would not import files from the NFS-based Apolloworkstations, which complicated merging files from the CAD and publishingsystems on the VAX with the illustration program on the Apollos.andP;  The Apolloworkstations received data from the VAX and processed it, but couldn't sandit back.andP;  Ultimately, the solution was to send data between the systems inthe form of ASCII files.andP;  This format was far easier to get across theoperating system border than were binary files, Jensen said.andM;The data representation formats of DEC's VAX architecture also complicatedmatters.andP;  The VAX's little-endian format--where byte 0 is the leastsignificant byte--and its floating-point representation caused problems forVMS files that needed to be read by the Appollo systems, Jensen said.andM;Installation was also a problem, because it took much longer than expected,he said.andM;Jensen went to Apollo and Excelan for a TCP/IP hardware and software solutionto his networking problems.andP;  The tab for the fix came to about $10,000.andO;Eventually, a data exchange rate of 20KB per second between the twoenvironments was achieved.andM;The total price for the workstations plus application software came to$160,000.andP;  Jensen said the original goal for the return on investment was 18months, but it actually took 24 months.andM;&quot;I think we came close.andP;  I think if we had had better connectivity [tools],we would have beat it,&quot; he said.andP;  The X windowing standard, for instance, wasnot readily available, Jensen said.andM;Even so, Jensen is moving ahead with plans to buy as many as five newRISC/Unix workstations because of the enticing price/performance advantages.andO;He intends to evaluate systems from Sun, Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix, Apolloand DEC.andP;  Jensen estimates his entire investment will be $250,000.andM;Incorporating the Unix workstations will require networking adjustments thatwill include connections to DECnet, TCP/IP and Local Area Transport.andP;  Therealso will be storage-backup issues to contend with; Jensen said he needs amethod to interchange media between VMS and Unix.andM;UNIX ON TRAILandM;A MicroVAX II that ran out of gas provided the incentive for the Denver lawfirm of Davis, Graham and Stubbs to move to Unix.andM;The 180 lawyers at the firm had a MicroVAX II running VMS, an Oracle RDBMSand a scheduling application written in-house.andP;  But it seemed that theMicroVAX just didn't have enough juice to handle the firm's applicationrequirements and the demands of the 50 employees using the MicroVAX.andP;  TheVAX/VMS system simply became overloaded, said George LaFramboise, aprogrammer/analyst for Davis, Graham and Stubbs.andM;Employees used the Oracle product for easy tasks that, because of theMicroVAX II's slow speed, sometimes took as long as two hours to complete:The MicroVAX lacked the necessary processing power to do the job.andM;The RDBMS performance improvements would have to come from a system thatcould work much faster and was much cheaper, according to LaFramboise and hisboss, John Schlue, the manager of information systems.andM;Schlue learned from the firm's management that the MicroVAX II replacementwould be his first mandate.andP;  At about that time, he also learned that theprogrammer who had installed the RDBMS on the MicroVAX II had resigned totake a position with another company.andP;  In short, Schlue was left with acomputer that was too slow and no staff members who were intimate with theapplications.andP;  &quot;We had to be creative about how we solved the problem,&quot; hesaid.andM;The only thing for certain, Schlue and LaFramboise said, was that thesolution had to combine Unix and RISC because of the price/performanceadvantages.andP;  LaFramboise also said he preferred programming with Unix becauseof the many available utilities and the ease of programming in C.andM;As part of his search, Schlue met with officials from DEC, Oracle, Accelr8Technology of Denver and Mips Computer Systems.andM;From DEC, he wanted a DECsystem 5400 and got a quote for $179,000 thatincluded hardware, software and networking.andM;The quoted price from Mips was $73,900 for the M/120 system.andP;  The totalhardware and software cost of the Mips system would be less than half thecost of DEC's 5400 offering, Schlue said.andP;  The new Unix-based Mips machinealso would offer 10 times the CPU power, twice the memory, much more diskspace and more MIPS than the MicroVAX II, Schlue said.andM;In addition, choosing the Unix platform signified a move toward consolidationthat would end the hodgepodge acquisition of different operating systems andapplications that were potentially incompatible, Schlue said.andP;  The M/120acquisition was not accompanied by a cost-justification analysis or by anyofficial, formalized return on investment calculation, because &quot;it was asystem we needed to replace,&quot; he said.andM;Ninety percent of the RDBMS-based applications conversions were completed injust 10 days, Schlue said.andP;  Other advantages included database-administrationimprovements such as a huge drop in the time needed to export and reimportthe database.andP;  The exporting procedure took four hours on the MicroVAX and 30minutes on the M/120.andP;  Reimporting the database on the M/120 took only anhour instead of the usual 10 hours, according to LaFramboise.andM;WOLVERINE-STYLE UNIXandM;While the lawyers bought a new computer to get rid of the old one, theVAX/VMS users at Michigan State University (MSU) in Lansing, Mich., aremaking a transition to Unix-based supercomputing that may end up extendingthe lives of their department VAXEs by as much as two years.andM;Researchers in the physics and engineering departments have moved theircomputational-intensive experiments from VAX/VMS platforms and rented time ona a Convex C220 minisupercomputer, which the university's central computerlaboratory acquired in April 1989 for $ 1.5 million.andP;  The central computerlaboratory is charged with overseeing a campus that has a full range ofcomputing needs.andP;  The laboratory's main mission is to keep the system and allits parts functioning at peak levels.andM;Because the C220 is located in the computer laboratory, the move signals ashift back toward centralized computing.andP;  But because of Unix'subiquitousness, this perhaps will be the last time the researchers will haveto experience a operating system port, according to Charles Severance, MSU'sproject leader for system quality and Unix.andM;A major impetus for the switch over was the contention that the cost ofmaintaining an old system was greater than the cost of purchasing a newsystem with more CPU cycles.andP;  In addition, th e MSU researchers have aninsatiable appetite for CPU cycles, he said.andM;For each department, it came down to a choice between returning to thecomputer center or purchasing a VAX upgrade.andP;  In terms of price/performance,Severance said he got more processing power by moving to the Convex than byupgrading the VAXes.andM;Once the Convex was operational, the load on the departmental and centralVAXes eased, Severance said.andP;  The VAXes will be used for general-purposecomputing such as word processing.andP;  He estimated that this move has extendedthe usefulness of each departmental VAX by two years.andM;Some of the VMS users complained about the move to Unix, but many made theadjustment in spite of themselves, Severance said.andP;  &quot;People are not using theVMS emulation tools&quot; provided by Convex, he said.andP;  Instead, they are usingvi, one of Unix's standard editors.andM;&quot;They see the writing on the wall.andP;  They say, 'I guess it's time for me touse Unix,'&quot; he said.andM;Many of these experimenters are much more willing to port to whatever systemsuits them at the moment, Severance added.andP;  For example, many users portedapplications to the CMS operating system of the laboratory's IBM 3090mainframe to take advantage of the extra CPU cycles.andM;&quot;If they're willing to convert to IBM CMS, they'll convert to anything,&quot; hesaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
