SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> APPLCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> CUPERTINO, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Apple Computer Inc. today plans to introduce five products that let groups of users of its Macintosh computers share common data and communicate more directly with other types of computers.    The products include a long-awaited &quot;AppleShare&quot; file server, which handles the data-sharing chores for a network of as many as 25 personal computers. The products are part of Apple's efforts to create a market for what it calls &quot;desktop communications.&quot; The company applied the same &quot;system solution&quot; strategy in 1985 and 1986 to develop a market for automated typesetting and document production using personal computers and laser printers that it called &quot;desktop publishing.&quot;    &quot;In 1987, we want to demonstrate that desktop publishing is just the threshold,&quot; John Sculley, chairman and president, said in an interview. &quot;Now, with desktop communications, we want to show how individuals can use Apple computers and networking products to work together in a group&quot; by sharing documents and data and communicating directly through their personal computers.    Other companies have provided network equipment and software programs for both Apple personal computers and International Business Machines Corp. PC and IBM-compatible computers. But none has gained wide acceptance or has set standards for others to follow in tying the two computer architectures together, as Apple hopes its products will.    &quot;Apple is bringing to bear a new standard for personal computer networks that makes sharing files almost transparent,&quot; said Tim Bajarin, analyst for Creative Strategies Inc. of San Jose, Calif. &quot;It may not be the most powerful network product, but it is the cleanest and easiest to use.&quot;    The key to the communications network is AppleShare, a $799 software program that converts a conventional Macintosh equipped with a hard-disk drive into a file server. Other Macintosh computers, as well as mainframe computers and IBM-compatible personal computers, also will be able to connect to the network through the file server. Certain non-Apple computers won't be able to fully manipulate data drawn from the file server, and Apple is relying on third-party software developers to provide programs for this purpose.    Apple first promised the file server nearly two years ago and had been criticized for the long lag before it was delivered. According to Peter Friedman, Apple's marketing manager for the desktop communications products, the file server program was much more difficult to design than expected because &quot;it weaves through everything and has to be robust enough and well-enough thought-out to tie printers and various computers together. That's not easy.&quot;    &quot;What's interesting is that the Apple file server isn't a box, it's software,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, publisher of PC Letter, a newsletter covering the personal computer industry. &quot;They must have had to go through some strategic redesign.&quot;    But Mr. Sculley said the file server is a good example of how Apple, in many ways, is becoming &quot;more of a systems software driven company. The large majority of the new technical hirees in recent months have been software engineers.&quot;    Three of the other communications products to be introduced today also are software. Two are programs that convert data from IBM 3270 mainframe computers and from IBM PC and IBM-compatible word-processing programs into a form that Apple's MacWrite word-processing software can use. The software converting data from IBM PC word-processing programs, called Apple DCA Filter Software, will be free. The AppleLine 3270 program will cost $99. Both will be available sometime in 1987's second quarter.    Apple also is offering a plug-in card that enables IBM PC and IBM-compatible personal computers to print out documents on Apple's laser printer, or eventually to tap into an AppleShare network. The AppleTalk PC card will cost $399 and will require other programs, as yet unavailable, to enable a non-Apple computer to manipulate and share data in the network. Apple dealers will begin selling the card immediately.    The final product is the LaserShare &quot;print spooler&quot; program that will make it easier for several personal computers to share a common printer. Costing $299, the program will be available in the second quarter.    Mr. Alsop called the AppleShare file server &quot;a great Macintosh-only file server,&quot; but he added that it falls short of truly allowing other brands and types of computers to share and manipulate data. &quot;There are still some other things they have to do&quot; to make Apple files more useful to other machines &quot;before it's as transparent with other computers as customers would like.&quot;    The new products are the first of a flurry of new products Apple plans to introduce in 1987. In March or April, the company is expected to unveil the first of several new versions of the Macintosh, and many analysts predict that by year's end, Apple will introduce new printers and an engineering workstation.    &quot;This is a new-product-driven industry, and we have our new products on track,&quot; Mr. Sculley said at the annual meeting yesterday. While Mr. Sculley stopped short of making firm predictions for the company for fiscal 1987, he said the new products will make possible &quot;a much better year than 1986, especially the second half.&quot; He didn't mention the new products specifically at the meeting.    For fiscal 1986 ended Sept. 26, Apple earned $154 million, or $2.39 a share, on sales of $1.92 billion. In the fiscal 1987 first quarter, Apple's net income rose about 2.8% to $58.5 million, or 91 cents a share, from the year-earlier period's $56.9 million, or 91 cents a share. Sales jumped 20% to $662.3 million from $553.9 million.    Mr. Sculley said that the stream of new products will continue even after 1987. &quot;Where Apple got in trouble in 1984 and 1985, we got behind the power curve of new products,&quot; he said. &quot;Our goal is never to let that happen again.&quot;    Apple's shares rose $2.625, to $55.375, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
