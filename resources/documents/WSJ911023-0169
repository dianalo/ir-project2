For the entire industry, oil prices were $4 to $6 a barrellower than the summer of 1990, when the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait drove prices sharply higher. In addition, natural gasprices this year have been depressed.   Texaco said the third quarter was the eighth consecutiveperiod in which profit margins for many petrochemicalproducts were depressed because of oversupply and weakdemand. However, gasoline refining and marketing profitsvaried from company to company. Companies with internationaloperations like Mobil and Texaco tended to fare better.   Mobil's stock was the only one of the five companies torise yesterday. It gained 87.5 cents a share to $72.625 ashare in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Texacoshares fell $1.125 to $64.875, Phillips slid 37.5 cents to$26.875, Ashland Oil was off 62.5 cents to $28.125, andOccidental dropped 75 cents to $22.625.                                                                                                          Mobil                                                                                                          The Fairfax, Va., company's net fell 3.7% to $365 million,or 87 cents a share, from $379 million, or 89 cents a share.But stripping away a $30 million charge for a litigationsettlement in the latest quarter and a $111 million gain ayear earlier, operating profit rose 47%.   Revenue fell 7.5% to $15.03 billion from $16.25 billion.   Mobil said its refining and marketing profit surged to$173 million from $5 million. Year-earlier profit wasdepressed because Mobil didn't fully pass along the rapidrise in crude prices quickly to consumers.   The company said that higher crude and natural gas pricescurrently are boosting its exploration and productionearnings but that refining margins have slipped because ofcontinued weak demand.                                                                                                          Texaco                                                                                                          Net plunged 25% to $286 million, or $1.01 a share, from$381 million, or $1.38 a share. Revenue slid 15% to $9.36billion from $10.95 billion.   The White Plains, N.Y., company said exploration andproduction operating profit fell to $218 million from $346million as oil prices were as much as $6 a barrel lower.Chemical profit slid to $3 million from an already-depressed$12 million.   The only bright spot for Texaco was its internationalrefining and marketing operations. Profit nearly doubled to$118 million from $61 million because of higher margins,particularly in Europe.                                                                                                          Phillips Petroleum                                                                                                          Net dropped 68% to $56 million, or 21 cents a share, from$178 million, or 72 cents a share. Not counting one-timegains totaling $43 million in the latest quarter and gains of$20 million a year earlier, operating profit fell 92% to $13million from $158 million.   Revenue fell 9.3% to $3.11 billion from $3.43 billion.   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said operatingprofits in all lines of its business declined.                                                                                                          Ashland Oil                                                                                                          Hurt by a one-time $10 million charge, the Ashland, Ky.,company reported a profit of $62.5 million, or $1.07 a share,for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares withyear-ago net of $59.1 million, or $1.06 a share.   Revenue increased 2.7% to $2.76 billion from $2.69billion.   Ashland said improvements in its chemical, coal and oilexploration operations were offset by lower refining marginsand losses at its 50%-owned Arch Mineral unit.
