<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0801 </DOCNO><TEXT>The offshore segment of the oil and gas industry that operates in theGulf of Mexico has undergone significant restructuring in the recentpast. This restructuring was brought on by the decline in the price ofoil and natural gas that occurred during this period. Figure 1 depictstrends in the price of selected benchmark crude oils for the past 7 yearsand helps illustrate this point. During this time, however, oil and gascontinued to comprise a significant portion of the energy feedstocksof the Nation. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) currently provides approximately12 percent of the Nation's oil and 25 percent of its natural gas. TheGulf of Mexico accounts for over 90 percent of domestic production ofboth oil and natural gas from the OCS. These statistics help to explainthe continued interest in the OCS of the Gulf of Mexico during a periodof declining prices. Though many unknowns remain, operators have compiledextensive knowledge of the geologic structure of the Gulf of Mexico OCS.This knowledge helps them to minimize losses often associated with drillingin frontier areas. Accordingly, interest in OCS lease sales remains strongas does exploratory and development activity. Reflecting this interest,OCS Lease Sale 113 set a new record for the number of blocks receivingbids. 12 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
