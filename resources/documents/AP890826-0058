Of Michigan Ban on Racial Harassment</HEAD><DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A University of Michigan policy aimed atcutting discriminatory harassment on campus is unconstitutional, afederal judge ruled.   University officials proposed the policy last year after assortedracist acts, including a widely publicized incident in which astudent disc jockey on a campus radio show allowed a caller to tellanti-black jokes.   U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled Friday that the policyviolates freedom of speech and was so vague that ``persons of commonintelligence must guess at its meaning.''   The ruling likely will have national significance, said HowardSimon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union inMichigan, which challenged the policy on behalf of an unidentifiedMichigan student.   ``Universities from Duke to Stanford and Wisconsin and in betweenare faced with these same kinds of problems and are consideringsimilar policies to the University of Michigan,'' Simon said.   The policy barred harassment or discrimination based on race,ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, nationalorigin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteranstatus. The ACLU did not challenge a part of the policy that barsphysical acts of harassment.   ``The policy is clearly well-intentioned _ the university needsto address problems of harmful racism on campus _ but the method bywhich they chose to do so assaults the principles of free speech andfreedom of expression,'' Simon said.   ``The judge has forced them to go back to the drawing board anddevelop a policy that doesn't violate free speech but protectsstudents from harassment,'' he said. ``The judge performed a publicservice.''   The university's general counsel, Elsa Kircher Cole, said she wasdisappointed by the ruling.   ``We had very carefully crafted a policy that would recognizeFirst Amendment rights of students while addressing the very seriousproblems of racial and sexual harassment on campus,'' Cole said.   Cole said the university had begun reviewing the policy beforeCohn held a hearing on it Friday, and now will decide whether torewrite it or appeal the judge's ruling.   A majority of Michigan Board of Regents had favored the policy,but Regent Deane Baker said he glad it was struck down.   ``My own belief is that people on campus should be completelyfree to speak as they wish,'' Baker said. ``One might not agree withwhat is said, but if there is any place where we should have freespeech it is our universities, where we seek to find truth.''</TEXT></DOC>
