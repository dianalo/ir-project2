Description of the Proposal</ITAG>NSCC's proposal would amend Rules 50 and 52 in order to provide a uniformprocedure for member transfers of customer positions in mutual funds associatedwith NSCC's Fund/SERV \3\<NOTE/> through the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATService'' or ``ACATS'').\4\<NOTE/> Under NSCC's proposal, if an eligible fund asset \5\<NOTE/> is held in book share form and all asset details are submittedin automated format, the transfer will be processed automatically throughNSCC's Fund/SERV.\6\<NOTE/> In order to transfer Fund/SERV eligible assets in a client'saccount, through the ACAT Service, from one brokerage firm to another,the firm to whom a customer's securities account is to be transferred (``receivingmember'') will submit to NSCC, in physical or automated format, a TransferInitiation Form (``TIF'') for a particular customer account, indicatingwhether the account includes mutual fund assets. NSCC will then performa preliminary edit of the data.\7\<NOTE/> If any data is missing, NSCC will reject the TIF and returnit to the receiving member for correction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ On November 20, 1987, the Commission approved NSCC's proposalto amend its rules and procedures in order to offer Fund/SERV as a centralized,automated processing system for the purchase and redemption of mutual funds.<T3>See</T3> NSCC Rules, R. 51 andamp; 52.

Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 22481 (September 30, 1985), 50 FR 41,274 (October 9, 1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A Fund/SERV eligible asset consists of mutual fund sharesin book-entry format that are associated with mutual funds which have beenadmitted to NSCC for the purpose of receiving purchase and redemption orders.NSCC Rules, R. 3, andSection; 7.<ITAG tagnum="28">NSCC's Fund/SERV allows participants to transmit information pertainingto purchase and redemption orders as of a specific date, including tradesnot submitted on trade date or trades previously rejected from the system.These orders are denominated ``as-of'' orders and a participant may submitthese orders at any time within six months after trade date. NSCC's proposedenhancement to the ACAT Service does not envision the transfer of ``as-of''orders, because these positions do not represent current positions withinthe transferred account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Presently, the ACAT Service can be used to facilitatethe transfer of accounts that have mutual fund assets. The broker-dealerto whom an account is being transferred, however, must initiate separatere-registration proceedings for the mutual fund assets and delivery andpayment, if any, occurs outside ACATS. <T3>See</T3> Letter from Allison N. Hoffman, Associate Counsel NSCC, toJulius R. Leiman-Carbia, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation,Securities and Exchange Commission (October 5, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A TIF must contain the following information: (a) Receivingmember's clearing number; (b) delivering member's clearing number; (c)customer's account number at the delivering member; (d) customer's accounttitle. <T3>See</T3> NSCC, ACATS PROCEDURES MANUAL, at A-1 (January 1986).NSCC will forward a copy of the TIF to the member carrying the customeraccount (``delivering member''). The delivering member must either acceptor reject the transfer request. A delivering member may reject a transferrequest if it does not know the account, if the TIF has errors, or if additionaldocumentation is required.\8\<NOTE/> NSCC will then issue a Control Report for receiving and deliveringmembers that will be available to the participating members by 8:00 a.m.\9\<NOTE/> of the day after the TIF has been submitted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Id.</T3> at C-1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ All times in this Order are referenced in terms of easterntime.The Control Report will reflect the status of the account relative to thedata submitted by the participating members.

If the deliverer rejects thetransfer request the rejected account will appear in the Control Reportwith the status ``Reject'' plus the Reject Code.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ NSCC will issue Control Reports on a daily basis, accountingfor all transfers performed through the ACAT Service. NSCC will notifya receiving member of transfer requests that have been rejected by thedelivering member and will delete such transfer requests from the ACATService. A receiving member resubmitting a rejected transfer request mustreinstate the request as if one had never been previously submitted.A delivering member accepting a transfer request must submit, in an automatedfashion, data regarding the customer account's assets within five businessdays of the receipt of the TIF.\11\<NOTE/> NSCC will attempt to provide any missing information (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a missing CUSIP number) or correct any format errors inorder to validate the data submitted by the delivering member.\12\<NOTE/> If the data submitted by the delivering member fails to havethe necessary information or contains one or more format errors, NSCC willnotify the receiving member that it has received the customer account databut that it contains errors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ NSCC, <T3>supra</T3> note 7, at D-1. NSCC's proposed Rule 50, andSection; 6 requiresdelivering members to submit asset details in an automated format. A deliveringmember will input this data through the Customer Account Asset Input/AdjustmentForm. The specific instructions for the automated input of this data willbe similar to the automated interface procedures currently in use for theACAT Service. Under NSCC's proposed ACAT-Fund/SERV Service, however, theCustomer Account Asset Input/Adjustment Form will contain additional ``fields''for the submission of the following asset information regarding the accountbeing transferred: (a) Customer's account number at the mutual fund andwhether the number was assigned by the delivering member or the mutualfund, (b) networking control indicator (if the account is a NetworkingAccount), (c) whether the account is held in customer or street name, (d)whether the transferred funds are Fund/SERV eligible, and (e) the registeredrepresentative's identity, if any.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ NSCC Rules, Proposed R. 50, section 8. A format errorconsists of a failure to supply information as required by NSCC's instructionsfor automated input.By 8 a.m. of the day after the delivering member submits data regardingthe customer account's assets, NSCC will make available to both the receivingand the delivering members an Asset Detail Report setting forth the mutualfund assets, along with the other account assets (<T3>e.g.</T3>, corporate common stock or corporate bonds). Eligible mutualfund shares which are held in book share form, will be set forth in a separatecategory on the Asset Detail Report. If mutual fund shares are held inphysical form or if the shares are not Fund/SERV eligible shares, the receivingand delivering members must arrange transfers outside the ACAT Servicebetween themselves.Within two business days of receipt of the Asset Detail Report, a receivingmember must accept or reject the account, or request the delivering memberto make adjustments.\13\<NOTE/> Within the same time frame, a receiving member acceptingan account will be required to submit transfer instructions for those mutualfund shares to be processed through Fund/SERV.\14\<NOTE/> If a delivering member makes an adjustment to the account,NSCC will generate a new Asset Detail Report and the receiving member willbe allowed two business days to submit the transfer information.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ NSCC Rules, R. 50, section 9.

Pursuant toNSCC's proposal a member's failure to deliver will be subject to the rulesof the member's DEA, rather than NSCC's rules.NSCC's proposed enhancement to the ACAT Service will occur in two phases.Under Phase I, access to this service will be voluntary. To be eligibleto participate, delivering members must be able to transmit data to NSCCin an automated format. In Phase II, all NSCC members will become eligibleparticipants, but to be eligible delivering members, must continue to haveautomated input capabilities.\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ NSCC expects to implement Phase II sixty days after theimplementation of Phase I.During Phase I of the proposed enhancement, standing instructions for thetransfer of assets will be derived by NSCC.

NSCC's Rationale</ITAG>NSCC believes the proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act \35\<NOTE/> because it promotes the prompt settlement of mutual fundtransactions by providing for the automated transfer of Fund/SERV eligiblebook shares as part of a transfer of a customer account from one brokeragefirm to another.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1 (1982).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>As discussed below the Commission believes that NSCC's proposed enhancementof the ACAT Service is consistent with the Act. Currently, NSCC comparescustomers' mutual fund transfer data submitted by broker-dealers, throughthe ACAT Service. The actual re-registration, delivery and money payment,if any, however, occurs outside the ACAT Service and remains the responsibilityof the participating members. NSCC's proposal to allow ACATS participantsthe use of Fund/SERV in order to facilitate the transfer of eligible mutualfund assets will inject specific duties and performance time frames intothe transfer procedure. This, in turn, will prevent unnecessary delaysin the processing of these transfers and, as required by the Act, willpromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of customer accounttransfers involving eligible mutual fund assets.\36\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>See</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(3)(F) (1982).NSCC's proposal combines the advantages of the Fund/SERV and ACAT Services,thus allowing for a greater participant control over the transfer of Fund/SERVeligible assets. As the Commission has stated before, Fund/SERV achievessignificant efficiencies for broker-dealers and mutual funds by offeringa centralized automated facility with standard formats for processing mutualfund information.\37\<NOTE/> The Commission also believes that the ACAT Service promotesthe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities by ``foster[ing]disciplined broker-to-broker communication related to cumbersome accounttransfers.'' \38\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24088 (February 10, 1987)52 FR 5,228 (February 19, 1987);<T3> See also</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26506 (January 31,1989) 54 FR 6,051, 6,052 (February 7, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22481,<T3> supra</T3> note 4, at 41,275.NSCC's proposal will allow for an efficient information sharing processregarding the transfer of eligible mutual fund shares through the ACATSsystem. At each stage of the transfer, the system will provide participantswith information concerning the status of the transferred assets in relationnot only to their counterpart, but also to the participating Fund members.NSCC will achieve this constant flow of information by issuing multiplereports that will enable participants to compare information regardingthe value of transferred assets and check the accuracy of re-registrationinstructions within specific time frames. In addition, the ACATS communicationsystem will also serve to remind participants, including Fund members,of those transfers over which no action has been taken. For this reason,the Commission believes that the effective communication system associatedwith ACATS will improve the information sharing process among participantsand therefore expedite the transfer of eligible mutual fund shares.Participating members' ability to transmit data through Fund/SERV's automatedenvironment will centralize the processing of re-registration informationfor eligible mutual fund shares. NSCC will transmit transfer instructionsderived by either NSCC or the receiving member. In either case, however,the information must be established in a standardized format before theinitiation of a transfer. This procedure will minimize delays associatedwith participant's failure to submit complete information on time.At the same time, the processing of transfers involving mutual fund assetsthrough Fund/SERV's automated system also will foster cooperation and coordinationwith ``persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions,''eliminating multiple communications and settlement arrangements betweenbroker-dealers and Fund members.\39\<NOTE/> This simplification will reduce the risks of failed deliveries,inadequate transaction records, operational errors and, ultimately, financialinsolvency.\40\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24088, <T3>supra </T3>note 37, at 5,230.NSCC's proposal allowing participants to use Fund/SERV as part of the ACATService will encourage the use of new data processing and communicationstechniques to promote more efficient, effective and safe procedures forthe transfer of mutual fund assets. This fostering of efficient means ofcommunication should provide for a faster transfer of mutual fund assetswhich will, in turn, give investors more timely control over their transferredassets. For these reasons the Commission believes that NSCC's proposalpromotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transfersinvolving eligible mutual fund assets and is consistent with the safetygoals embodied in section 17A of the Act.\41\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(1)(C) (1982) where, with regards to theclearance and settlement of securities, the 94th Congress found that ``[n]ewdata processing and communications techniques create the opportunity formore efficient, effective, and <T3>safe </T3>procedures for clearance and settlement'' (emphasis added).The Commission believes that the proposed rule change, as required by theAct, gives NSCC an increased capacity to safeguard funds in its custodyor control, or for which it is responsible.\42\<NOTE/> While NSCC will not guarantee the delivery of Fund/SERV eligibleassets, it will collect from the deliverer the value of the Fund/SERV eligibleassets being transferred and credit the receiver's settlement account.This procedure will encourage participants to expedite the transfer ofcustomer's mutual fund assets. In the event of a pending or rejected transfer,moreover, this procedure will provide receiving members with the valueof the transferred assets until the delivering member can obtain re-registrationof the assets and make subsequent delivery.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(3)(A) (1982).NSCC's proposal to collect the value of the transferred assets from deliveringmembers, offers protection to customers by ensuring constant control overthe value of the assets being transferred. At the same time, however, theproposal also protects the delivering member's interests because it retainsthe safeguards in place for the protection of Fund/SERV participants. Assuch, NSCC can require the return of any monies credited to a receivingmember's account through the ACAT-Fund/SERV Services.\43\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ NSCC Rules, Addendum D, at 2, <T3>see also </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24227 (March 17,1987), 52 FR 9,603, 9,604 (March 25, 1987).Finally, the Commission believes that NSCC's proposed rule change furthersthe development of a National Clearance and Settlement System (``NationalSystem'').\44\<NOTE/> The proposal encourages settlement of transfers among broker-dealersin a clearing agency environment, thus contributing to reduce physicalmovements of certificates in connection with transfer settlements amongbroker-dealers.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Section 17A(a)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2), directs theCommission to use its authority to facilitate the establishment of a NationalSystem in order to not only ``bolster sagging investor confidence but alsoto assure that the country maintains a strong, effective and efficientcapital raising and capital allocating system in the years ahead.''
