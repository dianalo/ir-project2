They want Boston TV weather forecasters to stop predictingon Monday and Tuesday bad weather for the weekend ahead.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I understand their side. There is a demand for it,&quot; saysThomas Larson, owner of the Pillar House Restaurant in Newtonand chairman of the Massachusetts Restaurant AssociationWeather Task Force. &quot;But if the {long-range} forecast doesn'tlook so good, hey, keep it a secret because it's so harmfulto business.&quot;   To that end, the association has solicited complaints andforwarded packets of its members' letters to the weathermen.   Mr. Larson says the problem is that long-range forecastsaren't very accurate. He doesn't object to three-dayforecasts, which he concedes are usually right.   Restaurateurs are bitter about predictions that keeptourists away from Cape Cod or the Berkshires. &quot;BeforeMemorial Day weekend, weathermen forecast terrible weather onthe Cape,&quot; recalls Cindy Eid, public-affairs coordinator forthe Massachusetts Restaurant Association. &quot;They told peopleif they wanted a peek of sun to head north. But it turned outto be one of the best weekends of the summer.&quot;   Frank Cardullo, owner of the Wursthaus Restaurant, sayshis Hyannis branch suffered $75,000 in lost revenue lastsummer on good weekends after rain had been predicted.   Other restaurant owners say winter-storm warnings are evenworse.   M.S.M. Management Co., Danvers, says that two years agoinaccurate predictions of a big storm for Feb. 24 cost itsrestaurants $100,000 in lost revenue. That same weekend, theHarvard Club of Boston says, &quot;the irresponsibility of theweather forecasters&quot; led to the cancellation of a dinnerparty for 250.   Some weathermen are sympathetic. Dick Albert, of WCVB-TVin Boston, says the letters have sensitized him to theproblem, but he adds that he has avoided five-day forecastsfor many years.   But most stations say it's more important to give thepublic what it wants. &quot;Whenever we don't have time to do it,the public complains,&quot; says Barry Burbank, of WBZ-TV. He sayshe makes it clear that the long-range view is less reliablethan the short-range picture: &quot;We don't call it a forecast.We call it an outlook,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
