For the first 30 minutes outside the capitol, the curves are hairpin, causing speeding buses and trucks to tilt around turns into oncoming traffic. If you are still conscious, the road straightens out near the academy, where the only thing to distract you is seeing the head of a cow on one side of the road and the rest of the carcass on the other.    But for Mexico's best young ballplayers the trip is worth it, because if they survive the Toluca Highway and make the grade at the academy, the next stop could be a shot at big-league baseball.    Out here, amid vast stretches of ranch and farmland, boys from 16 to 21 years old are put through a training regimen designed to turn them into professionals. And for virtually all of them, the ultimate goal is not Mexico's Triple A league, but the Major Leagues in the States. Ask any student where he will be in a few years and he'll quickly respond with the name of his favorite Major League team.    Eighteen-year-old first baseman Braulio Neri liked watching the New York Mets on satellite TV at home, and now his dream is to play first base at Shea Stadium. &quot;I try to pattern myself after Keith Hernandez,&quot; Neri said. &quot;He's the best.&quot; Because of Fernando Valenzuela, 19-year-old Salvador Guerra's loyalty is squarely with the Los Angeles Dodgers, easily the students' most popular team. &quot;We call them the Dodgers of Valenzuela,&quot; he said.    The academy, commonly called Pasteje after a nearby ranch once used to raise bulls for the bullfights, encourages students to dream big. &quot;Most of these kids grew up in a world so far removed from Major League ball in the States that it's an unbelievable dream,&quot; said Charles Whyles, a physical-education instructor. &quot;But we tell them if they work hard, they don't have to dream.&quot; As if to drive that home, dorm and rec-room walls are decorated with color posters of such notables as Steve Garvey, Willie Randolph, George Brett, Cesar Cedeno, and, side by side, two other greats, Valenzuela and Pope John Paul II.    No academy graduate has made it to the American Major Leagues. But several are on Minor League rosters, and some scouts believe it is only a matter of time before the barrier is broken. &quot;The kids coming out of Pasteje get better all the time,&quot; said Angel Figueroa, a scout who works Mexico for the Pittsburgh Pirates. &quot;They've had their eyes opened by Valenzuela, and they realize they can play in the Majors.&quot;    But students first must pass the academy's course. From April to August, as many as 600 prospects are evaluated by instructors, with cuts made continuously along the way. By September the Pasteje team is set. The playing season, which runs through January, involves games against teams from local semipro leagues. A typical day begins at 6:15 with a long run, a shower, then breakfast. At 9:30 students are driven down the dirt road from the dorms to the playing field to run wind sprints, shag flies and take batting practice. At 2 they return to the dorms for lunch, and at 3:55 a bell signals the start of the academic side of academy training. Teachers are brought in to help the students complete their high school educations and college preparation work.    Classes end at 7, after which students can write letters home, play pingpong, clean their spikes or rest. If there is a Major League game on TV, they spend the evening crowded around the big screen in the rec room. &quot;If the Yankees or Dodgers are playing the room is packed,&quot; said the academy's director, Jose Cruz. &quot;But it doesn't matter if Valenzuela is pitching or not, everyone must be in bed at 10 p.m.&quot; The only free time is Saturday night. Most students use the 5,000 peso allowance (about $3) they get every two weeks to go into the nearby town of San Pedro to relax. On return they're checked for alcohol, and if they've been drinking they're expelled. Several students even have been kicked out for smoking cigarettes, another serious offense.    The academy was started seven years ago by Alejo Peralta, a prominent businessman and owner of the Mexico City Tigers, who wanted to provide the Mexican League with a steady source of native talent to fill its rosters. But the focus is broader than just hitting and fielding. Instructors believe all aspects of a student's life must come together to mold a professional ballplayer, including broadening cultural horizons with the mandatory study of English, teaching proper table manners, and encouraging attendance at mass.    But the real work is baseball. Braulio Neri has been at the academy twice, first as a pitcher, then he was invited back as a first baseman. He sees the return invitation as a good omen. &quot;I think it will take a few years of seasoning in the Mexican League before I can move up,&quot; Neri said. &quot;I'm not worried about how long it takes because this is my job.&quot;    Salvador Guerra, who was one of five remaining prospects out of 300 who were cut in their first 90 days at the academy, said his priority now is learning to hit a curve. &quot;We play every day here and I'm learning,&quot; Guerra said. &quot;I have confidence because I've outlasted so many others.&quot;    His goal, like that of most academy students, is playing for the Dodgers. &quot;They told me I have the talent, and if I develop it's possible to make it,&quot; Guerra said. &quot;I've played baseball all my life, but only now do I feel good enough to be a professional.&quot;    ---   Mr. Banks is a free-lance writer living in Tucson, Ariz. </TEXT></DOC>
