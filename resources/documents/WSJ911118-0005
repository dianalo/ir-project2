Though Mr. Duke, a rogue Republican, was battered inSaturday's gubernatorial runoff in Louisiana -- losing toDemocratic former Gov. Edwin Edwards by 61% to 39% -- hardlyanyone believes this is the end of his political story.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's one guarantee about David Duke,&quot; says Rep. JimmyHayes, a Louisiana Democrat. &quot;He won't go away.&quot;   Mr. Duke could cause trouble for Mr. Bush and his party ina variety of ways. He could simply turn up at the Republicannational convention in Houston in July and set offhigh-visibility disruptions. He could challenge Mr. Bush inthe GOP primaries, and appear at the convention with somedelegates in his pocket. But the worst Bush scenario of allwould be a full-blown third-party presidential candidacy byMr. Duke that might actually benefit the Democrats.   Almost everyone believes Mr. Duke, who glories in thespotlight, will appear, in one guise or another, at theconvention. &quot;He's going to show up in Houston,&quot; saysDemocratic strategist James Carville, a Louisiana native.&quot;And if you think we've had trouble at our conventions withJesse Jackson, just wait until David Duke arrives at theirconvention.&quot;   He adds: &quot;That's not all, either. First the TV cameraswill focus on Duke; then they'll pick up all those niceJunior League Republican ladies trying to change the party'santi-abortion position. What a show. I'm going to enjoy it.&quot;   If he wanted to, Mr. Duke could even become a Republicandelegate himself, and conceivably watch from the floor as hisname was placed in nomination. &quot;Sure he could do it,&quot;concedes William A. &quot;Billy&quot; Nungesser, the Louisiana GOPchairman. &quot;I got 400,000 Republicans here in what's mostly awhite party, and when they vote, they're likely to vote forDuke.&quot;   Gary Koops, spokesman for the Republican NationalCommittee, says party researchers already are looking intoLouisiana's delegate-selection rules, though they won't bemade final until the GOP state central committee meets Dec.14. &quot;We will do what we can to exclude him from beingselected as a delegate to our convention and fromparticipating in that convention,&quot; says Mr. Koops.   Beyond disrupting the GOP national convention, Mr. Dukehas several inviting options.   The first is to run against Mr. Bush in the GOP primaries.Republican officials are convinced that's what he has inmind, and he indicated over the weekend that he wasconsidering such a move.   &quot;I believe this guy is going to run for president,&quot; saysGOP strategist Charles Black, who has close connections withthe White House. &quot;He's a press hog. He loves publicity. We'lltake him on and we'll beat the hell out of him.&quot;   Democratic strategists can hardly contain themselves inanticipation of a GOP primary contest between Mr. Duke, withhis Ku Klux Klan and Nazi-sympathizer background, and Mr.Bush. The possible addition of conservative columnist PatrickBuchanan to the GOP contest transports them to ecstacies theyhadn't dared think about a few weeks ago. Mr. Buchanan istaking the next two weeks off to make his decision.   But Mr. Duke, a Louisiana state legislator, also gets afree ride of sorts. He could run for president in theprimaries and still run either for a seat in the House ofRepresentatives or for Democrat John Breaux's seat in theSenate. That's because he can wait until July, when thepresidential primaries are all over, to file for races foreither of those federal offices.   Or, after he's run in the presidential primaries and lost,he could forgo the House and Senate options and start puttingtogether a campaign as a third-party candidate for president.He knows a little about that; he ran an almost clandestinepresidential campaign in 1988, picking up 47,000 votes in ahandful of states.   Mr. Duke has now lost two highly publicized races inLouisiana, first last year to U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston,when he got 43.5% of the vote, and now to Mr. Edwards, in thegubernatorial election. If he wants to win -- and manyobservers aren't sure he cares that much about winning -- hisbest chance would appear to be a congressional challenge inLouisiana's fifth district, which covers the ruralnortheastern part of the state and which remains a Dukestronghold.   The fifth district seat, now held by Democrat JerryHuckaby, faces redistricting early next year; most of itsblack precincts are supposed to be taken away to help form anew, mostly black district. &quot;Imagine what David Duke could dothere without all those black voters,&quot; says Rep. Hayes.   But Mr. Hayes, along with many other observers, doubtsthat Mr. Duke is much interested in becoming a member ofCongress: &quot;He might think that he's got too big for acongressional seat.&quot; It is even more unlikely he would careto take on Sen. Breaux, a much more formidable figure thanMr. Edwards.   Most observers think Mr. Duke's most likely course is torun for president in the primaries as a Republican and in thegeneral election as an independent. &quot;We have a nationalmovement at this time,&quot; Mr. Duke told the Associated PressSunday, in a signal of his intentions. &quot;Millions of Americansare supporting me . . . I feel this is only the beginning.&quot;   No one seriously doubts that George Bush will win hisparty's nomination for a second term. But Mr. Duke, in tandemwith Mr. Buchanan, could cause aggravating problems for thepresident in the GOP primaries. Mr. Buchanan might be able towin some votes in New Hampshire; Mr. Duke probably couldperform well in a number of southern primaries, especiallythose that permit cross-over voting by Democrats -- Georgiaand Texas, for example.   If both Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Duke run, Democraticstrategist Frank Greer expects the president would be forcedto move to the right to hold his conservative supporters inline. &quot;That leaves more of the middle open to us,&quot; says Mr.Greer.   Kevin Phillips, a GOP political theorist, sees Mr.Buchanan scoring points in New Hampshire and then beingknocked around by Mr. Duke in the south. &quot;It would be theultimate irony,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, &quot;if Pat Buchanan managedto get outflanked on the right by David Duke.&quot;   Where the speculation gets interestingand a lot lesscertain -- is if Mr. Duke runs as a third-party candidate.That's the prospect that most unnerves the Republicans.   It brings to mind George Wallace's third-party campaign in1968, when he carried Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi,Alabama and Georgia and collected 46 electoral votes. Mr.Wallace made the difference in a nip-and-tuck vote betweenDemocrat Hubert Humphrey and the ultimate winner, RepublicanRichard Nixon.   The bulk of Mr. Wallace's voters, most politicalscientists now concede, were in transition as far aspresidential voting was concerned from the Democratic to theRepublican parties. About 80% of them, or their ideologicalheirs, have now completed that political voyage, according toMr. Phillips, who wrote a widely read book tracing themigration.   Though Mr. Duke, with his neo-Nazi past, is a moresinister figure than Mr. Wallace, he appeals to the samekinds of voters. Mr. Duke, Republicans fear, could take awayenough of these white conservative votes to allow theDemocratic presidential candidate to capture several keystates. That would be an unanticpated advantage for theDemocrats and a serious setback for Mr. Bush. &quot;These KmartRepublicans,&quot; notes Merle Black, a political scientist at theUniversity of South Carolina, &quot;are precisely the voters whohave given the Republicans all their big majorities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
