The 13 nations that comprise OPEC agreed in November to slashproduction as of Jan. 1 in an effort to raise prices to their targetof $18 a barrel.   The agreement sparked a rally that has lifted the average priceof a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC to about $16 a barrel, up asmuch as $5 from late November.   OPEC officials want nations outside the cartel to join them intrimming output to spur another price pickup.   Representatives of a group of independent countries were meetingTuesday in London to discuss cuts. They met last month with OPECrepresentatives.   ``There is definitely a positive sign that, not only for ourinterest but for their own interest, they will do something inreducing the supply,'' Subroto, a former Indonesian oil minister,said in an interview.   ``The more they cut from their production, of course, the soonerwe can see it in dollars a barrel,'' he said.   He declined to speculate on the level of cuts the non-OPECnations might put in place. But he said it was likely they wouldmake an offer to OPEC, possibly next month.   One participant at the non-OPEC meeting said in London Monday hewas ``fairly optimistic about this meeting because we're all veryfriendly.''   Subroto predicted crude prices would definitely reach $18 in thesecond half of 1989.   New OPEC figures, he said, show member nations complied inJanuary with the new output accord. The agreedment set an overallceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13 nationsin the first six months of this year.   According to OPEC figures, 12 countries supplied a total of 17.42million barrels a day in January, just under the quota of 17.51million barrels.   The cartel said figures from the United Arab Emirates had not yetbeen received. That nation, however, has persistently overshot itstarget in the past, according to private analysts. Its current quotais 988,000 barrels a day.   Subroto said the supply figures were ``a sign that we are abiding(by) our quota.''   Private analysts estimated OPEC exceeded its ceiling in Januaryby about a million barrels a day.   OPEC said, however, it measures the quota by figuring crudeproduction and the amount of oil put into, or taken out of, stock.Production, which it defines as the amount of crude measured atstorage facilities, was 18.13 million barrels a day in January forthe 12 reporting countries.   It was the first time the cartel released monthly productionfigures.   Non-OPEC nations sending representatives to Tuesday's meetingwere Oman, Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia, China, Angola and Colombia. TheSoviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic, the Canadian provinceof Alberta and the American state of Alaska were expected to sendobservers.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
