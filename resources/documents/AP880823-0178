Iraq, in turn, accused Iran of moving a regiment into what waspreviously a no man's land between the opposing forces in thecentral front. It said the Iranians withdrew after Iraq adopted the``necessary measures.''   In Tehran, Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeiniappeared at a ceremony to commemorate the death of a Shiite Moslemsaint in the 7th century. It was his first public appearance sincethe Persian Gulf truce went into effect Saturday. Khomeini,however, made no remarks.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said ForeignMinister Ali Akbar Velayati sent an urgent message to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar advising him of ``theIraqi regime's intentions to launch military operations againstIran.''   IRNA reported Velayati said Iraqis have massed troops facingFakkeh on the central sector of the border.   It also quoted Brig Gen. Asghar Jamali, deputy commander ofIran's ground forces, as saying that United Nations observerswatched an Iraqi armored brigade move up to the western bank of theNahr Anbar river.   The agency reported Jamali said the Iraqis dug in and werefacing Iranian forces on the other bank of the river in thesouthern sector.   IRNA quoted Jamali as saying that at the request of the commandof the U.N. military observer group he ordered his troops not tofire or react in any way to the Iraqi movements.   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq open Thursday in Geneva andclaims by both sides of cease-fire violations could be an effort toseek an advantage in advance of the negotiations.   Iran's state-run television, monitored in Cyprus, showed the88-year-old Khomeini at the ceremony of mourning for Imam Hussein,who was killed in the year 680 by rival Moslems in a leaderwhipdispute.   Khomeini repeatedly covered his face with a hankerchief andnodded his head as if crying _ a traditional manner of showingmourning.   The patriach, who said last month that accepting the cease-firewas ``worse than drinking poison,'' stood up and walked from theroom unaided at the end of the ceremony.</TEXT></DOC>
