The investors will acquire all of the troubled thrift's assets and liabilities as of Nov. 13, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said. The acquired assets and liabilities will be held by a newly created federal stock association, Gulf Federal Bank, to which the eight-member investor group will contribute $400,000 in capital.    Gulf Federal was a federally chartered mutual association with $6.5 million in assets and $6.9 million in liabilities.
