Glenn Gardner, Chrysler Corp.'s topproduct-development engineer, is a man on a mission: tooverhaul the way Chrysler develops new cars. He's adoptingJapanese ideas wholesale.   That's ironic considering that Mr. Gardner's ultimateboss, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, traipsed through Tokyothis week blaming his company's ailments largely on Japan.But Mr. Iacocca isn't the only guy at Chrysler.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are times when you have to pull your head out ofthe sand,&quot; declares Mr. Gardner. &quot;You can't wake up in themorning and shave without looking at the problem. A lot ofour problems were of our own making. We can solve themourselves.&quot;   That's exactly what the Big Three car companies will haveto do in the wake of an extraordinary month in the MotorCity. It began with General Motors Corp. announcing, a weekbefore Christmas, that it will close 21 North Americanfactories and shed 74,000 workers by 1995. And yesterday Mr.Iacocca and his Big Three colleagues -- Robert C. Stempel ofGM and Harold A. Poling of Ford Motor Co. -- sat down withthe chiefs of Japan's Big Five auto makers to beg for mercy.The Japanese agreed to buy more U.S.-made auto parts and tosell more Big Three cars in Japan, but they won't sharplyreduce their sales in America.   So now the Detroiters are returning home, bruised by atrip that highlighted their weaknesses, and thus became a PRwashout. Today Mr. Iacocca will address the Economic Club ofDetroit, and tonight all three chairmen will attend ablack-tie gala preview at the North American InternationalAuto Show here.   But after the party's over, the Big Three chairmen willhave to face an unpleasant fact: For all their considerableimprovements during the past decade, their companies stilldon't consistently turn out cars as appealing -- in cost,quality and technology -- as the Japanese. Detroit remainsbound to the mass manufacturing methods of Henry Ford and themass marketing methods of Alfred Sloan, which the Japanesehave left behind.   To fix this, the Big Three may have to do things that theyonce would have considered unthinkable. One possibility iseliminating such long-cherished nameplates as Plymouth orOldsmobile. Higher on the list is overhaulingproduct-development methods to use Japanese-style task forcesinstead of traditional Detroit &quot;chimneys.&quot; Chrysler leads theothers in doing this, thanks in large part to Mr. Gardner,but all three U.S. makers still have much more to do.   Other steps could prove even more daunting. The Big Threeare still shackled by a United Auto Workers plant patronagesystem that pads extra dollars into the cost of each car. AndDetroit will be under pressure to hold some highly paidexecutives accountable for failures.   Here's a close look at all three issues, which have a lotto do with why Detroit is on the ropes.                                                                                                          Product Development                                                                                                          Detroit has closed its quality gap with Japan from acanyon to a gully. But, by the acknowledgement of many of itsleaders, it has to overhaul its product-development methodsto use teams instead of &quot;chimneys&quot; -- so called because theorganizations resemble side-by-side vertical structures thatdon't interact.   Just ask Mr. Gardner, the man in charge of developing thecrucial &quot;LH&quot; line of midsized cars that Chrysler will launchlater this year.   At age 56, Mr. Gardner is a 33-year veteran of Chrysler,and he spent most of those years developing cars the wrongway. But in 1985 Chrysler sent him to Illinois as chairman ofDiamond-Star Motors, then a joint venture between Chryslerand Mitsubishi Motors Corp. There he saw the Japanese systemin action, and returned to Chrysler determined to preach itsmerits.   &quot;There's no question that I'm a missionary,&quot; says Mr.Gardner, who reports to Chrysler's vice president ofengineering. &quot;Some people say I'm a zealot.&quot;   When Japanese companies decide to develop a new car, thefirst thing they do is appoint a task-force leader -- one whohas real power. The team includes people from all differentdepartments and disciplines: body engineering, interiordesign, purchasing, power-train, manufacturing, marketing,finance and more. The members all work in the same place andall report to the team leader, no matter what department theycome from.   The system does much to reduce something that's the baneof any big corporation, whether it makes cars or computers:time-consuming and costly turf battles among departments.   Take the power-train people, responsible for engines andtransmissions. If the task force decides a new model reallyneeds a new engine, they carry the message back to theirdepartment and make sure the team gets the engineers to dothe job. Top management sets broad parameters, but then staysout of the way.   That isn't the case in Detroit. Here, departments functionas separate chimneys. Traditionally, Detroit's product-teamleaders are mere coordinators among departments withoutauthority over anyone. So if a car needs something that anyparticular department decides is too troublesome or costly toprovide, it's tough luck.   &quot;Strong chimneys drive decisions without regard for thecustomer,&quot; Mr. Gardner explains. The classic example is GM'sfinance staff, whose decisions in the early 1980s led toCadillacs that looked like Chevies that looked like Pontiacs.The finance staff got what it wanted -- cars that werecheaper to build -- but customers didn't.   Or consider the compromises in the new Pontiac Grand Amand sister compact cars recently launched by GM. The cars gethigh marks for styling and other attributes, but they useoutmoded three-speed automatic transmissions instead of thepeppy, fuel-efficient four-speeds now standard on competingJapanese cars.   When Mr. Gardner took over Chrysler's LH project in 1989,his bosses made him a team leader with power. That's whyChrysler, despite a late start, is developing the LH cars inrecord time.   The first LH prototypes were ready 95 weeks before &quot;jobone,&quot; the scheduled launch of production this summer.Ordinarily, Chrysler wouldn't have its first models readyuntil 65 weeks before job one. The extra 30 weeks allows formore testing to catch flaws.   Moreover, Chrysler is developing the LH cars with about740 people. That's still more than the 650 people on thetypical Mitsubishi new-product team, but it's far fewer thanthe 1,400 employees Chrysler used to need to bring new modelsto market.   The cost savings and streamlined decision-making allowChrysler to give the cars features that otherwise might berejected as too costly. The LH task force, for example, chosea new cruise-control device that drivers can operate withouttaking their hands off the steering wheel, a feature somecompetitors already offer.   &quot;Those kinds of decisions would have been turned aroundtwo or three times in the past,&quot; says Mr. Gardner. &quot;Theproduct planners would have recommended the change, but thesteering wheel guys would have said, `Why move it? It costsmoney, and it's trouble.'&quot;   And by cutting the cost of developing new models, theJapanese system makes it feasible to do it more often. TheJapanese revamp most of their cars every four years. Bycontrast, the Big Three often go a decade without redoingmodels. Chrysler hasn't introduced any truly new models sincethe K-cars in the early 1980s.   The Japanese approach to product development is spreadingaround Detroit. At GM, such a team created the new CadillacSeville. Ford has formed a team to bring out the new (andlong overdue) Mustang. It has another team revamping theTaurus and Sable sedans for 1995.   But the reforms go only so far. Ford's finance staff, forexample, retains control of all of its members, even thoseassigned to a product team. The finance staff is jealous ofits prerogatives, and fears that its members might getco-opted by the engineers they're assigned to work with.Finance staffers who show signs of this are derided as &quot;goingnative.&quot;                                                                                                          Confronting The Union                                                                                                          The companies have come to regret their 1990 mastercontract with the UAW. It forces them to pay hourly workerseven if there's no work. The big loser is the company thatnegotiated it: GM.   By agreeing to a $4 billion job and income security fund,Chairman Stempel hoped to get in return more cooperation fromthe UAW and its top GM negotiator, Stephen P. Yokich. Butnow, Mr. Stempel complains that Mr. Yokich won't even agreeto have union members take vacations during a two-week Julyshutdown rather than spread them throughout the year. Mr.Yokich made just such a money-saving concession when he wasthe UAW's top bargainer at Ford.   Mr. Stempel also says he's asked the UAW repeatedly torenegotiate terms of the current contract to ease the drainon GM's cash. (So have Ford and Chrysler.) But aides to Mr.Yokich say he won't give an inch. That tough line reflectsthe fact that this is an election year -- for the UAW.   Mr. Yokich and UAW President Owen Bieber face re-electionthis spring. The union also is fighting a bruising battlewith Caterpillar Inc. to defend its pattern contract in thefarm and heavy-equipment industry. Giving in to GM wouldweaken its stand there and dismay GM members who see thecontract as their safety net in case of layoffs, unionofficials say.   But UAW politics are imposing a high tariff on GM cars.   Agreements between the company and the union call for GMto pay local union officials overtime whenever even a handfulof union members are working overtime in a plant. The resultis that some UAW shop chairmen make more than $100,000 ayear. Al Alli, the shop chairman at GM's Lordstown, Ohio,facility, turned down a $60,000 a year job at UAWheadquarters. &quot;I can't afford it,&quot; says Mr. Alli, who drivesa $60,000 red Cadillac Allante.   UAW leaders also pack plants with loyalists assigned tonon-production jobs created under the umbrella of GM's jointlabor-management cooperation effort. At GM, a plant with4,000 workers must have at least 16 full-time &quot;joint program&quot;representatives -- one for every 250 workers.   GM's Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., has some 400non-production posts under the UAW-GM &quot;jointness&quot; programs.One recent appointment was a full-time &quot;industrial hygienist&quot;whose job is to work with management to improve air qualityinside the plant.   Mr. Yokich says these health and safety operatives doimportant work. And he contends the UAW isn't to blame forDetroit's big losses in money and market share. The realproblem, he says, is management.                                                                                                          Accountability                                                                                                          Who's responsible for the record losses in Detroit? Thisquestion points to broad issues about managementaccountability that dogged the Big Three chairmen across thePacific this week.   Some of the big U.S. industrial companies going throughpainful downsizings also are demoting or dismissingexecutives whose operations have performed poorly. But itrarely happens in Detroit.   Chrysler's Mr. Iacocca has confessed to squanderingbillions on &quot;grandiose&quot; diversification schemes and anawkward holding-company structure in the late 1980s. But he'sstill on the job, earning $4.65 million last year and with alucrative contract for this year that grants him 62,500shares of Chrysler stock each quarter.   GM Chairman Stempel has said repeatedly that he plans nochanges in his top management team. But some top GM officersstill wonder aloud about the future of President Lloyd E.Reuss, the 33-year company veteran who has run GM's coreNorth American vehicle business since 1986. When Mr. Reuss,55, was named president in 1990, the board didn't give himthe title of chief operating officer, as it usually does forthe president. Now, outside directors are increasing pressureon Mr. Reuss to turn his operations around, some GMexecutives say.   GM's North American track record is dismal. Despite GM'sowning the largest market share, analysts estimate itsvehicle operations have lost a staggering $6 billion a yearfor the past two years. And they earned only marginal profitsin the late 1980s, when U.S. car sales hit record highs. Bycontrast, GM's European car business earned $1.9 billion in1990 on less than a quarter of North America's $113 billionin revenue.   GM's biggest money-loser, the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canadagroup, has strong ties to Mr. Reuss. When this hugemanufacturing and marketing operation was created in a 1984reorganization, Mr. Reuss was the vice president in charge.He organized it along a traditional, functional chimneymatrix. Manufacturing managers reported to one boss,engineers to another.   In addition, the group's key assembly plants werededicated to building just one model. The plant in Doraville,Ga., for instance, builds only the Oldsmobile CutlassSupreme. It's running at half capacity, however, because ofslow sales.   Most Japanese plants build several different models on avariety of rear-drive or front-drive chassis. If sales of onemodel flag, the factory builds more of another. Such plantsalso are better able to build low-volume niche models thatare becoming more critical to market success. Few Big Threefactories are this flexible. One of the closest is Ford's inWixom, Mich. It builds two rear-drive and one front-driveluxury models on the same line.   Now, the manufacturing and car development strategies thathe installed at the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada group are beingdismantled in the face of huge losses. Last year, the groupsaid it will reorganize its engineers intoproduct-development teams similar to those established in themid-1980s by Mr. Stempel when he ran theBuick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group. And by 1995, GM will squeezesix midsized models built at five Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canadafacilities into four or fewer plants.   But downsizing won't be enough without eliminating costlyduplication of effort and micro-management in functionsranging from purchasing to warranty service. For example, oneparts-supplier executive says he had to convene more than adozen GM engineers in his office to settle squabbles among GMdivisions over a detail in product-performance. &quot;Ford sendstwo people,&quot; he adds. The Japanese send none; they simplyhand responsibility for design and testing of parts tosuppliers.   Mr. Stempel and others praise Mr. Reuss's efforts tochampion initiatives to improve quality and make factoriesmore efficient. Among them are redesigning vehicles to reducethe number of parts, and adopting Japanese-stylemanufacturing systems. GM's cars have improved substantiallyin quality in recent years, although they still don't equalthe best Japanese models.   Mr. Reuss himself appears hurt and exasperated by thepersistent rumors that his job is on the line. At a pressconference during the North American International Auto Showhere this week, Mr. Reuss was asked directly if he fearedlosing his job.   &quot;We tried to put that to bed,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought wehad.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
