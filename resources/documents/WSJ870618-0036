Paul J. Powers, chairman and chief executive officer, said sales should rise about 13% to more than $310 million.    In the year ended Oct. 31, the company earned $10.6 million, or 97 cents a share, on sales of $274.5 million.    The projected 1987 earnings and sales gains follow seven years of volatility for the maker of hydraulic parts, specialty metal products and filters and separation products.    Reeling from effects of a strong dollar, increased foreign competition, a shrinking capital goods market and product lines with little room to grow, the company saw sales fall to $168.7 million in 1983 from $247.5 million in 1979. During the same period, net income slipped to $3.3 million, or 31 cents a share, from $18.1 million, or $1.68 a share. Sales and earnings rose in 1984, only to fall again in 1985.    But company officials consider fiscal 1987 the comeback year. The turnaround &quot;is primarily the result of a restructuring program that is beginning to pay off,&quot; Mr. Powers said in an interview. The executive, who was previously president and chief operating officer, assumed the top posts June 1.    The revamping, which began in mid-1985, was designed to reduce administrative costs, to redeploy assets to products promising stronger profit growth, and to diversify into new high-growth businesses. The company cut its white-collar work force 27% and closed several plants in the U.S. and Europe. About 45% of the company's operating earnings are generated by its foreign operations. </TEXT></DOC>
