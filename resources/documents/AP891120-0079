It'll be a few weeks before they start trickling in.''   About 30 lawyers attended a training seminar on handlingpolitical asylum litigation over the weekend at Southern MethodistUniversity.   The seminar, sponsored by Proyecto Adelante, the State Bar ofTexas, Catholic Charities and the South Texas Pro Bono AsylumRepresentation Project, was aimed at relieving what officials sayis a critical shortage of lawyers willing to assist politicalrefugees.   ``I think this is probably the greatest area of need in thiscountry that is not being met,'' said Steve Anderson, a businessattorney in Dallas. ``I think a lot of the people would be facing adeath sentence if they had to go back.''   Ms. Stifler is the only full-time worker for Proyecto Adelante,where the majority of the clients are Salvadoran. She and avolunteer handle about 1,300 cases a year.   ``We haven't had to turn anyone away so far, but we're not goingto be able to continue if we don't get some help,'' Ms. Stiflersaid.   Thousands of immigrants still are being held in detentioncenters in southern Texas and are in dire need of legal assistance,said Karen Keltz Haring, director of Political Asylum Projects forSouthern Methodist University.   Ms. Haring said detained refugees must be prepared so they caneffectively convince judges and immigration officials that theirlives would be in jeopardy if they were not allowed to stay in thiscountry.   ``Many don't speak English, or understand the workings of thecourt,'' Ms. Haring said. ``It's hard enough for someone with alegal degree and who speaks English fluently to do it.''</TEXT></DOC>
