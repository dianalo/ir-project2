Stanley Tulchin, chairman of Reprise Capital, was named chairman of the portrait photography concern, succeeding Clinton L. Byrnes, who resigned in June, the company said. PCA also said John Grosso, former president and chief executive officer of Nimslo International Ltd., was named president and chief executive officer, succeeding Ronald A. Norrelli, a management consultant who had been serving as interim president since Mr. Byrnes and two other top PCA officers resigned in June.    As reported earlier, Reprise Capital agreed to provide PCA with a secured loan under certain conditions, including designating a majority of the company's directors and its chief executive. Terms included a $3.5 million promissory note and a $1.5 million debenture, convertible into the equivalent of 47% of PCA's common shares outstanding. PCA also said it completed refinancing debt owed to institutional creditors, as required by the agreement with Reprise Capital.    PCA shares were quoted yesterday at $1.50 bid, unchanged, in over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
