Loss of wetland and riparian vegetation, wildlife habitat,and endangered species and their special habitat could occur. Potentiallysignificant cultural resources and their research potential could bepermanently destroyed. Construction and operation of the pipeline facilitieswould result in the loss of pristine visual environment and degradationof established visual resources. The probability of significant winderosion would be high, with significant intensive surface runoff increasingsediment load and decreasing water quality in many areas.</TEXT></DOC>
