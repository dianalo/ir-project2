 The NCR 3445 33-MHz 486 is the first available unit;it features up to four CPUs, up to 64MB RAM, 3.3GB fixed disk array, andseven MCA slots.andP;  This unit will be upgradable to a 50-MHz 486.andM;A ProgrammingandM;Language in a TSRandM;Portable Computer Systems offers a simple way to create applications.andP;  VIA isa full-featured memory-resident programming language designed both fortechnical and non-technical users.andP;  VIA provides the tools to gain keyboardcontrol over third-party applications, letting users retrofit any applicationwith features that may have been omitted by the original designers.andP;  VIA isuseful for creating online help, security, and menuing systems, and containsspecial commands that facilitate file I/O between applications that have beenlocked up by their proprietary file structures.andP;  In other words, users canretrofit applications with new features.andP;  VIA's syntax structure is similarto BASIC, and users can create it by using any ASCII text editor or wordprocessor.andM;RPlot Represents DataandM;GraphicallyandM;RSoft's utility for plotting scientific data lets users view experimental andtheoretical results.andP;  With RPlot, users simply type &quot;plot&quot; followed by one ormore data file names, and the program graphs the data.andP;  RPlot lets you tailorthe graph with error bars, logarithmic axes, flexible labeling, multiplefonts, superscripts and subscripts, scientific symbols, arrows, arbitrarylines and text, and the full Greek alphabet.andP;  Users even have control overfont sizes and colors.andP;  The user can save customized graphs as templates.andO;RPlot uses ASCII data files created by data acquisition systems andrecognizes multiple data sets and textual comments.andM;ProLine Lets UsersandM;BackUp from WhereandM;They WorkandM;Tecmar unveils a line of network backup subsystems optimized for NovellNetWare.andP;  The ProLine is a family of server-based tape and optical diskbackup drives.andP;  Tape backup ProLines let users back up from any workstation.andO;They range from 250MB to 2.2GB of storage area, and are available for the ISAor MCA bus.andP;

 Requiring no add-in boards nor adedicated PC, the ChainLink software connects PCs via standard telephone wire(connected to serial ports with a special adapter) and a central modem-sizedswitching unit.andP;  The ChainLink software is loaded in RAM on each PC and sendscommands to the switching unit, which in turn acts as the hub for thenetwork.andP;  Operating at speeds up to 115 kilobits per second, ChainLink allowsusers to share files with any disk on the network, send and receive e-mailmessages, share peripherals, view directories, and manipulate any file on thenetwork.andM;High-End ForecastingandM;Business Forecast Systems bolsters the high end of its forecasting productline with Forecast Pro Batch, a complete forecasting system designed toforecast thousands of items automatically.andM;Using a variety of univariate methods, FCB, interfaces directly intocorporate databases, including SQL databases.andP;  To operate FCB the usercreates a script file containing a list of the data to be forecasted and anydesired forecast settings.andP;  FCB then prepares forecasts and places them intoLotus .WK1, .UNI, .KEY, or .MLT files.andM;When analyzing data, FCB determines which univariate method will be the mostaccurate, then uses it to forecast the model.andP;  For users who don't trust thisarrangement, they can manually select which methods are to be employed.andO;Other features include exception reporting, monitoring for forecast bias, anda built-in forecast evaluation option that will withhold data from the end ofeach series and will check the forecasts against the actual value--allowingusers to fine-tune the model for accuracy.andM;DFI's Color ScannerandM;DFI's CHS-4000 Color Handy Scanner has a scan width of 4.13 inches atresolutions from 100 to 400 dots per inch.andP;
