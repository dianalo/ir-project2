James (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> INVN SKB </CO><IN> TNM PHA </IN><TEXT>   SmithKline Beckman Corp. said it agreed to pay $15 million to buy at least 9.6% of Invitron Corp.'s common shares. Invitron in turn will manufacture SmithKline's version of a bioengineered drug that is being hotly pursued as a potential therapy against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Philadelphia-based SmithKline said it reached a preliminary agreement with Invitron whereby the St. Louis company will make soluble T4. Soluble T4 is SmithKline's designation for a compound known generically as CD4, a protein that researchers hope will block or impede the progress of the AIDS virus in an infected individual.    Martin Rosenberg, SmithKline's vice president of biopharmaceutical research and development, said Invitron, a small biotech firm, was chosen to produce soluble T4 for SmithKline because &quot;they had the manufacturing capacity in these kind of mammalian cells. They had the scale.&quot;    SmithKline, like other major pharmaceutical companies, lacks the in-house expertise to make the more complicated molecules through recombinant DNA methods. So it had to turn to a smaller concern specializing in such work. SmithKline plans to have a pilot bioengineering plant up and running next year, said Mr. Rosenberg.    But SmithKline needs to produce reliable and large amounts of the protein sooner than next year if it is to begin clinical trials late this year or in early 1989 as scheduled. Genentech Inc., of South San Francisco, Calif., has already begun clinically testing a CD4 product in humans. Other competing groups, including Biogen Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, are attempting to develop CD4 as well.    Invitron is able to get relatively higher yields from gene-spliced mammalian cells than other biotech concerns because it has perfected a process called continuous perfusion, which allows it to grow more cells for each processing chamber. Invitron's patented process allows that larger number of bioengineered cells to produce more substances at relatively low operating costs. Its product is also purer than that produced by other methods of cell culturing, such as the batch technique.    The CD4 protein is found in high levels on the surface of T-4 cells, the white blood cells that trigger the immune system's disease-fighting response. The T-4 cells are infected and destroyed by the AIDS virus, resulting in the collapse of the immune system.    Researchers hope that if the body is flooded with synthetic CD4 through intravenous infusion, the AIDS virus could be tricked into binding with the impostors, rendering the virus harmless to healthy cells.    As part of the SmithKline agreement with Invitron, SmithKline would buy about 1.5 million Invitron shares and warrants to buy about 217,000 shares at $10.35 a share. If the warrants were exercised, SmithKline's investment in Invitron could go as high as 10.9%.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Invitron closed at $7.25, down 50 cents.    The companies said the agreement also gives SmithKline rights to Invitron's proprietary technology in exchange for an undisclosed cash payment and additional license payments as well as manufacturing revenue guarantees or royalty considerations. The transaction thus has a value of about $21 million. </TEXT></DOC>
