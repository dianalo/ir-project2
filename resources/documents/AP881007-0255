The realignment prompted the firing of 300 headquartersemployees announced Thursday.   The supermarket giant said its board of directors unanimouslyrejected both of the latest unsolicited proposals made by the NewYork City-based Kohlberg Kravis in an Oct. 4 letter to Kroger.   In New York, spokeswoman Ruth Pachman said Kohlberg Kravis hadno comment on Kroger's response.   Kohlberg's more lucrative buyout offer of $5.03 billion, or$64-per-share, represented a sweetened offer from a$58.50-per-share pitch KKR made after entering the bidding lastmonth.   Dart Group Inc., of Landover, Md., started the bidding Sept. 19with a $4.32 billion, $55-per-share offer. Dart has not madeanother buyout offer.   Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham said the board again decidedthat Kroger's restructuring is preferable to selling the companybecause it gives shareholders immediate cash dividends along withequity in a continuing company, although it would be smaller andmore highly leveraged. As envisioned, the restructuring would leaveKroger independent and publicly owned.   ``Our program will permit shareholders to realize substantialimmediate values on their common stock, while retaining thecontrolling equity interest in a company with a bright future,''Everingham said.   Kroger shareholders have filed at least four lawsuitschallenging management's decision not to sell Kroger.   Kohlberg Kravis' latest proposals included the $5.03 billionbuyout offer and a separate proposal to buy Kroger even after itcompletes the restructuring. Kroger has said its restructuringwould require the layoffs announced Thursday and selling some realestate, supermarkets and convenience stores, as well asdistribution and food-processing centers.   ``Kroger's board concluded that both these latest KKR proposalswere inadequate and not in the best interests of the company, itsshareholders and other constituents,'' Kroger said in a statement.``In making its determination, Kroger's board considered variousfactors, including the opinion of the company's financial adviser,Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., that both KKR proposals are inadequate.''   The Kroger board said it also was concerned about possibleregulatory antitrust problems and whether Kohlberg Kravis couldobtain the necessary financing. Kohlberg Kravis owns other foodretailing companies, including Stop andamp; Shop Cos., Safeway Stores andBeatrice Cos.   Kroger said Thursday's mass firing, which gives employees up tonine months' salary and other benefits for up to a year, will savethe company at least $13 million annually. The firing does notaffect supermarket employees.   Some analysts say Kroger's staff reductions which leave 500employees at it headquarters, still isn't likely to discouragetakeover-minded outsiders.   ``This is throwing bleeding hunks of meat over the bow of theboat, hoping the shark will slow down,'' said Ryan Mathews, seniorassociate editor of Grocery Marketing, a trade publication. ``Theshark wants a whole dinner, not just an appetizer.''</TEXT></DOC>
