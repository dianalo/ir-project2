On August 24, 1989, we presented a questionnaireto the Government of Canada in Washington, DC, concerning petitioner'sallegations. On September 25, 1989, we received responses to our questionnairefrom the Government of Canada (GOC), the Provincial Government of Ontario,A.H.A. Manufacturing Limited (AHA), and Stretch Sales, Inc. (Stretch Sales).On October 4, 1989, we delivered supplemental/deficiency questionnairesto the GOC and the other respondents. On October 12, 1989, we receivedresponses to the supplemental/deficiency questionnaires.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms pruposes. The written description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is limousines, which is definedas extended wheelbase and expanded seating capacity motor vehicles principallydesigned for the transport of persons, of a cylinder capacity exceeding1,500 cubic centimeters, and having spark-ignition internal combustionreciprocating piston engines of six or more cylinders (gasoline-enginepowered). The vehicles are built on Lincoln Town Car, Mercury Grant Marquis,Cadillac Brougham or any other six or eight cylinder gasoline engine poweredchassis. The vehicle is cut in half and the wheelbase is extended, therebyproviding additional rear seating capacity, area and comforts. The sheetmetal work is formed to complement the original design of the base care.The vehicles are used by private individuals, corporations and limousineservices. Limousines are currently provided for under the following HTSsub-headings: 8703.23.00.75, 8703.24.00.75 and 9802.00.50.40.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which weare measuring subsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1988.This review period corresponds to AHA's fiscal year. According to its response,Stretch Sales made no sales for export to the United States during thereview period.Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a responseto an allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefitsunder a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program,and the Department has no persuasive evidence showing that the responseis incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary determination.All such reponses, however, are subject to verification. If the responsecannot be supported at verification, and a program is otherwise countervailable,the program will be considered a subsidy in the final determination. Basedon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaire,we preliminarily determine the following:<ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Used</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that manufacturers, producers or exporters inCanada of limousines did not receive benefits during the review periodfor exports of the subject merchandise to the United States under the followingprograms:A. Federal Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) and Promotional ProjectsProgram (PPP)</ITAG>The PEMD was consolidated and restructured in 1987 and now includes theformer PPP. Support provided under the new program is either industry-initiated(former PEMD) or government-initiated (former PPP). Under the industry-initiatedcomponent, interest-free loans are provided to industries requesting assistancein export market development. Under the government-initiated component,the GOC organizes and sponsors international trade fairs and missions.The interest-free PEMD loans are repaid over a period of years from salesrevenues on sales to the export market that was the object of the promotionalactivities sponsored by PEMD. If no sales or insufficient sales are madeto the export market in question within a given number of years, the outstandingloan is forgiven.In 1982 AHA received PEMD loans for a trade fair and a market survey toenhance sales of limousines for export to the United States. The outstandingbalances on these loans were subsequently forgiven in 1986. Consistentwith past practice, we are considering the forgiven PEMD loans to be grantsto AHA in the year in which the loans were forgiven. Because the purposeof these loans is to encourage the development and expansion of exports,we preliminarily determine that benefits under this program are exportsubsidies.It is our practice to expense very small grant amounts (less than 0.50percent of the value of export sales or total sales, as appropriate) entirelyin the year of receipt. (See, for example, <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Oil Country TubularGoods from Canada</T3>, 51 FR 15037, April 22, 1986 (<T3>OCTG</T3>).) Since the amount of the forgiven loans was less than 0.50percent of total exports of AHA to the United States in the year the loanswere forgiven, we expensed these grants entirely in that year.Because the benefit of these grants was expensed prior to the review periodand since no PEMD loans were forgiven or outstanding during the reviewperiod, we have concluded for purposes of this investigation that AHA didnot use this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Certain Investment Tax Credits (ITCs)</ITAG>There are several categories of ITCs in Canada, some of which include differentlevels of ITC rates depending on the size of the business and the locationof the investment. Based on our previous examination of ITCs in Canada(See <T3>OCTG</T3> and <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada</T3>, 51 FR 10041, March 24, 1986), weinitiated an investigation on the following four types of ITCs: (1) Taxcredits of three and 13 percent above the basic seven percent rate whichwe have previously found non-specific, for investment in ``qualified property''located in certain regions of Canada; (2) tax credits for investment in``certified property''; (3) tax credits for large companies of 10 percentabove the basic twenty percent for investment in capital equipment usedfor scientific research; and (4) tax credits for investment in transportationand construction equipment.Canadian tax law provides that ITCs may be subtracted from taxes owed andif no taxes are owed (either because a company is initially in a tax lossposition or because only some of the ITCs were used to satisfy all taxliability), those excess ITCs earned after April 19, 1983, have a refundable,one-time cash value equal to 20 percent of the initial, face value of theITC (40 percent for small businesses).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Regional Development Incentive Program (RDIP)</ITAG>The RDIP was established in 1969 for the purpose of creating stable employmentopportunities in areas of Canada where employment and economic opportunitiesare chronically low, namely the Atlantic provinces. The RDIP was administeredby the Department of Regional Economic Expansion (DREE) until 1983 whenit was replaced by the Industrial Regional Development Program (IRDP).The DREE offered incentives based on a case-by-case evaluation of capitalinvestment projects. Projects that could proceed without RDIP assistancewere ineligible. Assistance was provided in the form of grants or loanguarantees.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Industrial and Regional Development Program (IRDP)</ITAG>The IRDP was established in 1983, replacing the RDIP. The program was designedto promote industrial development in all regions of Canada through financialsupport in the form of grants, loans and loan guarantees. To accomplishthis goal, assistance was provided for four major purposes: (1) to encouragethe development of new products and new processes and to increase industrialproductivity and competitiveness; (2) to assist in the establishment ofnew production facilities; (3) to increase industrial productivity throughthe improvement, modernization and expansion of existing manufacturingand processing operations; and (4) to improve marketing. The level of benefitreceived under the IRDP depended upon the census district in which a projectwas located. Census districts were classified into one of four tiers basedon economic development. The main factors considered in measuring economicdevelopment were employment, per capita income, and tax revenue receipts.The most economically deprived districts received the greatest IRDP assistance.The IRDP program was terminated on June 30, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Export Credit Financing</ITAG>The Export Development Council (EDC) was created to facilitate and developCanada's export trade within the framework of the Canadian Export DevelopmentAct. The EDC, a self-sustaining Crown Corporation, pursues its purposeby providing insurance, guarantees, and financing. EDC provides exportfinancing to foreign buyers of Canadian goods and services. Funds are disburseddirectly by EDC to Canadian exporters on behalf of the foreign buyer, ineffect providing the exporter with a cash sale.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Loans under the Enterprise Development Program (EDP)</ITAG>The EDP was established in 1977 to promote the growth of the manufacturingand processing sectors of the Canadian economy by fostering innovationin the design and development of new or improved production processes andby assisting adjustment to changing competitive circumstances. Individuals,firms, or corporations in Canada engaged in manufacturing or processingwere eligible for assistance.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Community-Based Industrial Adjustment Program (CIAP) Grants</ITAG>CIAP was established in 1981 as part of the Industrial and Labor AdjustmentProgram. It was terminated in 1984. Assistance under the CIAP was providedfor capital projects to commercial enterprises located in areas affectedby serious industrial dislocations. Assistance was provided in the formof non-repayable contributions to cover up to 75 percent of consultingcosts for capital projects and repayable contributions to cover up to 50percent of capital costs. Commercial enterprises throughout Canada wereeligible for assistance, provided the project was located in a designatedarea.B. Joint Federal-Provincial Programs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Development Agreements (GDA)</ITAG>GDAs provided the legal basis for various departments of the federal andprovincial governments to cooperate in the establishment of economic developmentprograms. The GDAs were umbrella agreements which stated general economicdevelopment goals. Ten-year GDAs were signed with most provinces in 1974.Subsidiary agreements were signed pursuant to the GDAs. The subsidiaryagreements were generally between particular federal and provincial governmentdepartments and addressed economic development and infrastructure needs.These agreements established various individual types of economic developmentprograms, delineated administrative procedures and set out the relativefunding commitments of the federal and provincial governments. Subsidiaryagreements were typically directed at establishing traditional governmenteconomic assistance programs, developing infrastructure, providing foreconomic development assistance for certain regions within the province,and providing financial assistance to specific regions, industries or enterprises.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Economic and Regional Development Agreements (ERDA) </ITAG>ERDAs are essentially a continuation of the GDAs. ERDAs were signed withevery province and territory in the early 1980's. Similar to GDA subsidiaryagreements, ERDA subsidiary agreements establish programs, delineate administrativeprocedures and set up the relative funding commitments of the federal andprovincial governments. Assistance is aimed at projects designed to upgradeinfrastructure, such as transportation and convention centers, and to enhanceproductivity, particularly for small businesses. C. Provincial Programs <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Ontario Development Corporation (ODC) Export Support Loans, OtherLoans and Loan Guarantees </ITAG>This program was established to assist in the development and diversificationof industries in Ontario. Assistance is provided in the form of loans,loan guarantees, and grants. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the informationused in making our final determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 703(f) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination.
