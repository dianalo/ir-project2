One disturbing, though unsurprising, note in the report was an acceleration in inflation. According to a broad measure known as the deflator, prices during the period rose at a 4.1% annual rate, the fastest pace since the 4.2% rate in the first quarter of 1984. The pace in the first quarter was 1.7%.    Many economists, citing the expanding economy and the relatively low rate of unemployment and high rate of capacity utilization, contend that prices may accelerate in the second half. Government economists, however, played down the second-quarter rise, contending it partly reflected higher, drought-related food prices that don't indicate a general jump in inflation. They predicted that any further pick-up in overall prices would be modest.    The rise in economic growth, as measured by the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services -- followed a revised 3.4% rate in the first quarter, previously reported as 3.6%. The department said the reduction in farm output caused so far by the drought lowered growth by about half a percentage point.    With the latest report, the department also released its annual revision of the GNP figures for the past three years. Growth in 1987 was raised substantially, to 5% from 4%, measured from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter.    The growth of nonfarm inventory investment eased again in the latest quarter, which should further allay concerns of an excessive buildup. Also, the growth of consumer spending slowed, a change that was welcomed by policy makers as an indication that the economy is shifting from a consumer-driven expansion to one led by exports. Much of the slowdown was due to reduced new-car sales.    &quot;I think this is a perfect report&quot; on the second quarter, said Robert Wescott, a vice president at Alphametrics Corp. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. He cited lean inventories, slower consumption, strong business investment and the narrower trade deficit. &quot;And the past three years have been stronger than we thought, to boot,&quot; he added.    Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner told a news conference that &quot;the economy is on the right track&quot; toward slowing domestic demand so that more resources can go for business investment and exports.    The quarterly figures bring the first-half growth rate to a 3.3% pace, meaning the economy would have to grow at a 2.7% pace in the second half to meet the administration's forecast of 3% growth for 1988. Most economists contend the economy will do so easily; some, in fact, fear growth could be considerably stronger, leading to a further acceleration in inflation. Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., said, &quot;There's nothing in the report to suggest we won't see more good growth ahead, and that's dangerous.&quot;    The stepped-up inflation rate in the second quarter was due to higher prices for consumer goods and services. At a meeting with reporters, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said that the acceleration has been due to temporarily higher prices for food and imported goods and services.    &quot;I'm pretty confident we're not on the verge of an inflationary surge,&quot; he said, contending that the Federal Reserve has been pursuing a monetary policy &quot;that brings neither a recession on one hand nor an acceleration in inflation on the other.&quot; Moreover, he predicted that growth might slow a bit further in the second half; many policy makers are hoping for a modest slowdown to help curb inflation.    The trade gains in the second quarter reflected a rise in exports and a decline in imports, the first drop since the first quarter of 1986. The slower consumer spending growth included a decline in purchases of nondurable items. Home building picked up a bit after a drop in the first quarter; many analysts expect growth in the industry to remain sluggish, reflecting higher mortgage rates.    In its revisions, the department said the increase in growth in 1987 reflects stronger business spending, nonfarm inventory accumulation and consumer spending. The personal savings rate was reduced.    The increase in GNP was lowered to 2% from 2.2% in 1986 and raised to 3.6% from 3.3% in 1985. The second quarter of 1986 was revised to a decline of 0.8% at an annual rate from a rise of 0.6%, largely as a result of weaker nonfarm inventory investment. Officials said such a drop isn't unusual in a long expansion.    The GNP figures are adjusted for seasonal variation as well as for inflation. The revisions update the seasonal adjustment factors and incorporate new data. Before inflation adjustment, second-quarter GNP ran at an annual rate of $4.807 trillion, up from a $4.725 trillion pace in the first quarter.    Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:                                   2nd Qtr.     1st Qtr.                                     1988         1988    GNP ........................   3,986.3       3,956.1    less: inventory chng .......      45.0          66.0    equals: final sales ........   3,941.3       3,890.1                Components of Final Sales    Personal Consumption .......   2,574.2       2,559.8    Nonresidential Invest.......     489.2         473.4    Residential Invest..........     190.8         189.5    Net Exports ................     -90.1        -109.0    Gov't Purchases ............     777.2         776.4   In the second quarter, the implicit price deflator rose to 123.2% of the 1982 average, from 121.8% in the previous quarter.
