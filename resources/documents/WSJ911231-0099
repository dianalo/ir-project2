Oil industry critics say the companies should develop WestSak before moving on to such pristine areas as the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge and other spots along the NorthSlope.</LP><TEXT>   But West Sak, even though it's right next door to Prudhoe,isn't seen as very desirable to the oil industry. Although itmay contain as much as 25 billion barrels of oil -- more thanthe amount it has taken 30 years to bring forth from Prudhoe-- there's doubt about how much of it can be produced atreasonable cost. West Sak's oil is heavy and viscous becauseof its proximity to Arctic permafrost, industry officialssay.   Atlantic Richfield Co., which controls the bulk of WestSak, says little of the area's oil can be squeezed out. ButU.S. government and Alaska state officials, as well asenvironmentalists, say billions can be pumped and that itcould be produced economically at oil prices ranging from $21to $25 a barrel. That's not much higher than current pricesof about $19.   &quot;From a technical standpoint, as much as half a billion toone billion barrels could potentially be recovered, saidWilliam Van Dyke, an official with Alaska's Department ofNatural Resources who focuses on reserve estimates for thestate. Added G.D. Sharma, who spearheaded a study for theU.S. Energy Department regarding West Sak: &quot;At least 25%, or6.25 billion barrels, of the 25 billion figure can bewithdrawn.&quot;   Mr. Sharma's estimate is drawing close to the slightlymore than eight billion barrels that have been produced fromPrudhoe since it began flowing in 1977.   But Atlantic Richfield challenges the official estimatesand argues that production from West Sak won't happen anytimesoon. Arco officials say that field contains about 10 billionbarrels of which only 5%, or 500 million, can be retrieved.   And so the dispute goes. West Sak is called the &quot;hiddenoil field&quot; by environmentalists and industry critics. Theyclaim oil companies in Alaska have been downplaying itsexistence to prop up their argument that they need to drillin the Wildlife Refuge in order to fend off dependence onimported oil.   The industry for years has been in pursuit of permissionto drill in the Refuge, considered the hottest oilexploration prospect in North America. Geological datasuggests that the oil men have a good shot at striking oilthere but no one knows for sure. Although an energy bill thatincluded a provision calling for drilling in the Refuge diedlast month before it even made it to the Senate floor,industry efforts to revive the issue of drilling there willpick up once congress reconvenes.   The North Slope of Alaska provides 25% of the oil used inthe U.S. And although the amount of oil being pumped has beenslipping, except for a temporary surge following the PersianGulf War, the amount of recoverable reserves in existingfields has actually been increasing as new technology makesit easier to squeeze oil from the reservoirs. For instance,original estimates pegged the amount of recoverable oil fromPrudhoe Bay's 23 billion barrels at nine billion. That numberhas climbed to anywhere from 12 billion to 14.25 billionbarrels in recent years. &quot;There is more oil in the existingfields than is generally recognized and that's one of thereasons I'm opposed to drilling {in the refuge},&quot; saidRichard Fineberg, who prepared a study on the issue for theAlaskan legislature. And indeed, &quot;West Sak is the wild cardin the deck.&quot;   More than 10 oil and gas fields have been identified alongthe North Slope of Alaska, of which five -- Prudhoe, Kuparak,Endicott, Lisburne and Milne Point -- are in production. ButWest Sak, which isn't being produced to a great extent, byfar overshadows all of them except for Prudhoe in terms ofreserves.   Arco officials say they haven't yet determined how the oilcan best be retrieved despite years of testing. HoweverConoco Inc., a unit of DuPont Co. that controls a smallcorner of the field, appears to have one answer. Just lastyear, Conoco began pumping oil from its piece of West Sak ata location it has dubbed Shrader's Bluff.   Getting the oil from the reserve is tricky; the oilworkers had to devise a technique to keep the sand that isheavily interspersed throughout the oil from being pumped upthe casing, or well piping, with the crude. Producing from&quot;West Sak is certainly do-able on our property,&quot; AlanHastings, a Conoco executive in Anchorage, said.   Arco officials say they have examined Conoco's techniquebut claim it's an uneconomical method for them -- its pieceof West Sak is closer to the permafrost and therefore moreviscous, they say. They claim Conoco can hold down its costby moving the oil, once it's pumped to the surface, throughfacilities it is already using for another field where thereis additional capacity. Arco also says that the strata thatcontains its piece of West Sak oil overlies its prolificKuparak oil field where there is no extra capacity. And asKuparak production declines, West Sak will hopefully bephased in. Arco also points out the daily flow rate at WestSak won't replace Prudhoe or Kuparak production and is not analternative to a large oil discovery in the refuge oranyplace else.   However, Jim Clark, oil analyst for First Boston Corp.,believes that Arco's refusal to pump from West Sak is thecompany's way of telling the state that a change in tax lawsseveral years ago was unacceptable. Mr. Clark said the taxchange dictated that any oil produced from the West Sakformation would be considered part of the Kuparak oil fieldrather than be considered separately. As a result, the taxrate for Kuparak production would have jumped to 12.5% or 13%from 8.5%.</TEXT></DOC>
