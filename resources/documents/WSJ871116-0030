But the foreigners are taking a beating in doing so.    So far this year, central banks have spent about $90 billion trying to stem the currency's 14.3% fall against the Japanese yen and 12.1% decline against the West German mark, traders and analysts estimate. The central banks may have succeeded in softening the dollar's drop a little. But their growing pool of dollar holdings has been dwindling in value relative to their own currencies.    &quot;Buying dollars isn't profitable for the national treasury, that's for sure,&quot; a Japanese official says.    The main goal of this massive intervention is to influence exchange rates and, over the longer term, trade patterns. But it also can have a direct impact on the national budgets of West Germany, Japan and some other major U.S. allies. That's because central banks generally turn over a large chunk of their annual surpluses to their governments, and some of those surpluses are expected to be a lot thinner this year.    For instance, the West German Bundesbank last year had a surplus of 7.80 billion marks ($4.06 billion at year-end 1986 exchange rates), of which 7.34 billion marks was transfered to the federal treasury. Similarly, the Bank of Japan added 94% of its surplus of 1.066 trillion yen ($7.31 billion at then prevailing rates) to Japan's budget revenue for the year ended March 31.    Analysts predict that the Bank of Japan's and particularly the Bundesbank's contributions this year will be smaller, mainly because of the huge growth of their foreign currency reserves and the falling value of those largely dollar-denominated reserves.    From Jan. 1 through the end of August, the latest date for which data are available, Japan's foreign currency reserves rose by $27.64 billion and West Germany's by $10.19 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund. And as of Oct. 31, Britain's reserves had climbed $26.51 billion. Economists say almost all of this growth can be attributed to central banks buying dollars and selling their own currencies.    Another problem for foreign governments is that &quot;if you're buying dollars, you're expanding your domestic monetary base if you can't offset (the intervention) by selling domestic securities,&quot; says Stephen H. Axilrod, who is vice chairman of the U.S. unit of Japan's Nikko Securities Co. and a former senior official of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Such a rise in money supply is generally viewed as undesirable because of its inflationary implications.    In fact, a surging money supply in Japan and West Germany this year has prompted the central banks of both nations at times to push interest rates higher to damp the inflationary pressure. Such a move by the Bundesbank in late September and early October led to Bonn's acrimonious debate with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that some analysts have said helped bring on the global stock market crash.    If the world monetary system could function without central bank intervention, vast amounts of foreign currency reserves could be liquidated and the funds put back in circulation, economists say.    &quot;In other circumstances, those are resources that could be put to other uses,&quot; John Lipsky, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., says. However, he says: &quot;These holdings aren't there as an investment. They're there for policy purposes, to guarantee the ability to ensure orderly markets.&quot;    And in the view of one central banker, &quot;The effects of the exchange rate on the home economy and world economy so dominate any considerations of your reserves portfolio&quot; that the value of the reserves themselves is of comparatively little importance.    The major central banks keep their dollar holdings almost exclusively in U.S. Treasury bills, mainly because security and liquidity are &quot;of paramount concern&quot; to the banks, Mr. Lipsky says. In addition, when dollar holdings are large, as they are now, foreign banks sometimes buy specially issued, non-marketable Treasury securities.    Part of the recent decline in Treasury bill yields may reflect central banks' currency intervention efforts, some economists say. In trying to support the dollar, central banks have been such active buyers of Treasury bills that they have helped to push up prices and thus reduce yields to about 6% on three-month bills.    The central banks have little chance to protect themselves from the dollar's fall. When possible, they try to reduce their U.S. currency portfolios by selling dollars back into calmer markets. Traders say the Bundesbank did this when the dollar strengthened in late July and early August.    There also have been reports that the Bank of England at times has switched some of its dollar holdings into marks. Such a move could reflect Britain's concern about the sterling-mark exchange rate, which affects its trade with its European partners. But it probably doesn't hurt that the mark has been holding up better than the dollar lately.    Such modest switching, though, is &quot;about all you can do,&quot; a former Fed official says. &quot;Basically, they (the central banks) are stuck,&quot; he says. &quot;They're almost entirely exposed to the dollar's decline.&quot;    The question of profiting on currency activities is a touchy one for central banks. Many don't disclose either the returns on their foreign currency holdings or their trading activities.    The Fed is an exception. As of July 31, the Fed's foreign currency reserve portfolio and the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund were valued at a total of $3 billion more than when the currencies were acquired.    For the three months ended July 31, the two funds showed a $212.9 million profit from the Fed's own intervention and trading activity. The Fed's foreign currency reserves are mainly in strengthening currencies such as the mark and the yen.    &quot;Profit shouldn't be the overwhelming motivation of central banks in trying to manage the markets,&quot; Stefan Schoenberg, the Bundesbank's representative in New York, says.    &quot;Policy is the key thing,&quot; Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of the U.S. unit of Yamaichi Securities Co. and a former New York Fed official, says. &quot;The main problem for central banks and governments is the broader one: the effect of the dollar on their trade positions and finance, not on the balance sheet of central banks.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Pardee says, &quot;You have to be able to show you operate efficiently, that you're not being taken to the cleaners every time.&quot;    The dollar's three-day rally took a rest, leaving the U.S. currency little changed in dull trading.    Strong resistance at the 1.70 West German mark level and uncertainty about whether the U.S. will act soon to reduce its budget deficit combined to put a lid on gains for the dollar.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 135.81 Japanese yen, off slightly from 135.84 late Thursday, and 1.6888 marks, up marginally from 1.6878.    In early trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 136.45 yen.    The dollar reached intraday highs Friday of 1.6970 marks and 136.27 yen, capping a rally that began with President Reagan's remark Tuesday that he doesn't want to see the dollar drop further and was given a boost by Thursday's news of a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit for September.    Many of its gains were undone, however, as the week ended without an agreement between White House and congressional negotiators on cutting the deficit. The market seemed largely unimpressed by assurances coming out of Washington that progress was being made.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.10 an ounce to $464.60 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $463.55 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, Nov. 13, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
