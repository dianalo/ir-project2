ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oil prices closed little changed Friday in aquiet yet volatile session Friday. Traders saw evidence thatPresident Bush's attempt to calm the energy markets was having someeffect.   The November contract for delivery of light, sweet crude fell 3cents to $39.51 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York MercantileExchange after trading as high as $39.95 a barrel and falling aslow as $38.65. Later contract months closed narrowly higher.   There was no news directly from the Middle East to influencetrading, but the House voted during the afternoon to triple to 15million barrels the amount of oil the government can remove fromthe nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The vote was expected bythe market, but still had a sobering effect on trading.   Also putting a damper on prices was speculation that the NewYork Merc would increase its margin requirements to limit theamount of money traders could borrow to purchase oil contracts.   Such a move would drive speculative traders out, reduce thevolatility in the market and force prices down, said NaumanBarakat, a senior trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.   Despite such bearish news, prices did not fall sharply Fridaybecause they were supported by buying from traders afraid eventsover the weekend might send prices down further, said Jim Fiedler,an energy market analyst with E. D. andamp; F. Man International FuturesInc.   Bush's decision Wednesday to tap 5 million barrels from the 590million-barrel oil reserve was having some of the calming effect onthe market that the president sought, analysts said.   Prices responded only briefly on Thursday to his decision, butanalysts saw more of a reaction Friday.   Although the president cannot control what happens in a freemarket, ``there's a general feeling that Bush is putting quite abit of political pressure on the industry to keep the price below$40,'' said Fiedler, noting that Bush has pressured oil companiesin the past to keep prices down.   ``Bush is saying, `Read my lips, I want crude to stay below$40,''' Fiedler said.   Oil prices did cross the $40-a-barrel mark briefly Thursday butfell back. The October contracts for refined petroleum productsexpired Friday, causing some volatility, but as in the market forcrude, trading was dominated by concerns about the Middle East.   Home heating oil for October delivery rose 0.61 cent to $1.0498a gallon, and subsequent months also advanced. Seasonal factorsalso contributed to heating oil's gains, as demand for oil rises inthe fall.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline futures declined, also influenced byseasonal factors - the end of the summer driving season. Octobergasoline dropped 0.93 cent to $1.0176 a gallon. Later months alsodeclined.   In natural gas trading, the November contract fell to $1.935 per1,000 cubic feet from $1.940 on Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
