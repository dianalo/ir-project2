It is a fixed-price meal: $12,000 per couple.    Rep. Kemp is also delivering a less expensive menu of conservative tidbits directly to hundreds of thousands of homes. The New York congressman's letters promise steadfast opposition to tax increases, to liberal Democrats and to &quot;Communist tyranny.&quot; Requested donation: $100 or less.    Rep. Kemp is searching for dollars both high and low. For years he has courted a relatively few millionaire backers for huge donations, skirting a tattered and laxly enforced federal election law in ways that got him into political trouble more than once. Now he is also wooing checks of $50 and $100 from thousands of hard-line conservatives, some of the same donors who give to Ronald Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina.    Mr. Kemp's tactics are born of necessity. His campaign is running on empty; at one point he even was $200,000 in debt. Among the reasons for these financial woes: He spent $2.6 million in his congressional reelection last year, depriving him of any campaign surplus to help the presidential bid; he had a bigger-than-expected paid staff, and many traditional Republican donors have been giving to Vice President George Bush or Sen. Robert Dole.    As a result, as Rep. Kemp says in a recent fund-raising letter, &quot;If I can't raise enough money now to meet early expenses, I won't have a chance.&quot;    His relatively small stable of wealthy donors generally isn't part of the boardroom set. They tend to be entrepreneurs like William F. Gorog, retiring president of the Magazine Publishers Association and founder of the company that developed the widely used Nexis and Lexis electronic information-retrieval systems.    To collect as many dollars from them as possible, Mr. Kemp has used a seemingly endless array of political committees. Federal law prohibits donors from giving more than $1,000 per election to any federal candidate, or more than $5,000 per year to any political-action committee. But Mr. Gorog is listed as giving $12,000 on Feb. 18, apparently intended to be half from him and half from his wife, Gretchen. The money went to a joint fund-raising committee called &quot;Victory '88,&quot; which was to divide it into legal-size gifts to &quot;Jack Kemp for President Committee&quot;; &quot;Citizens for Jack Kemp,&quot; his debt-ridden 1986 House reelection committee; and &quot;Campaign for Prosperity,&quot; his cash-strapped PAC.    The same arrangement will be used to portion out $12,000 gifts from next week's dinner, preceded by cocktails at Mr. Gorog's home in McLean, Va. The invitation includes 15 lines of fine print explaining, &quot;in accordance with Federal Election Regulations, 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(3),&quot; how the money will flow.    Mr. Kemp's limit-skirting tactics repeatedly caused him political embarrassment in the past. He accepted corporate donations including $15,000 each from Dow Chemical Co. and PepsiCo Inc., and gifts from individuals as large as $50,000, using a tax-exempt foundation called the &quot;Fund for the American Renaissance.&quot; It took in more than $500,000 in tax-deductible donations between 1981 and the middle of last year, promoting Mr. Kemp's free-enterprise ideas and paying for polling and travel.    But during his House reelection campaign last year his Democratic opponent, James Keane, filed a lawsuit claiming it was a thinly disguised political committee and not a charitable, educational endeavor at all. The suit was tossed out after the election, but not before a red-faced Mr. Kemp resigned from the board and released a list of donors that he had previously insisted on keeping secret. The foundation is now &quot;in mothballs,&quot; says Charles Black, the campaign manager.    Mr. Kemp's House foe also sought an official investigation of a supposedly homegrown political committee called the &quot;Michigan Opportunity Society&quot; used by Kemp backers during early Republican delegate-selection contests in that state last year. Mr. Keane claimed it was an illegal dodge to get around reporting requirements and limits. Only one of the Federal Election Commission's six members favored investigating, so the case was closed and it still isn't known how much the committee spent or where the money came from.    More Kemp committees popped up, one in Iowa and another in New Hampshire, states with early presidential contests. Another surfaced in South Dakota. All three are subsidiaries of Mr. Kemp's PAC but they don't report to federal election authorities and, by giving only to state-level candidates, may escape federal limits. But the New Hampshire committee attracted unfavorable publicity, and Kemp spokesman John Buckley says all are inactive now. The main PAC itself, which used to pay for much of Rep. Kemp's political staff, travel and mailing expense, has only a single employee left, his aides say.    Last month, the Kemp campaign asked the election commission for advice on how far it can go in authorizing and assisting &quot;delegate committees&quot; to raise money for pro-Kemp slates of convention delegates, without having the money count against the campaign's limits.    But the candidate's handlers insist they won't repeat the kind of legal end-run with delegate committees that brought Democrat Walter Mondale a lot of criticism and a large fine in the 1984 election. &quot;We've been extremely careful since Jack filed the (presidential) exploratory committee not to use these other entities in a way that would advance the presidential campaign,&quot; says Mr. Black, the campaign manager.    The various Kemp committees served their purpose while they lasted. One donor, Florida-based computer software developer Bruce Barrington, is listed as giving, since 1980, $50,000 to the Kemp foundation, $15,000 to the Kemp PAC and $2,500 to the joint fund-raising committee. His wife is listed for $15,000 to the PAC and $2,500 to the joint committee, for a family total of $85,000. Robert Krieble, chairman of Loctite Corp., gave along with his wife $20,000 to the Kemp foundation and $34,000 more to various Kemp political committees, also since 1980. Several other large donors gave again and again to Mr. Kemp's various entities.    Now Rep. Kemp is turning his eye to smaller donations, which can add up to big money. His chief fund-raiser is Rodney Smith, who headed fund raising for Sen. Helms's $16 million reelection campaign in 1984, the most expensive Senate race to date. Mr. Smith then raised roughly $90 million for the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 1985-86, the most ever for such a party committee. </TEXT></DOC>
