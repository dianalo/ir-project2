Despite the lack of knowledge about the safety technology,however, 62 percent of the adult licensed drivers who had heard ofair bags approved of their use, according to the survey releasedThursday by the American Coalition for Traffic Safety.   Among the misconceptions about air bags widely held by Americandrivers were these:   _Seventy-one percent were moderately or very concerned that theair bag might not inflate.   _Sixty-six percent thought the air bag might inflate when itshouldn't.   _Fifty-seven percent were worried the air bag might block vision.   _Forty-eight percent thought the air bag might pin them in theircar.   _Twenty-two percent believed that kicking a car bumper couldmake an air bag inflate.   ``These myths and misconceptions reflect a knowledge gap thatmust be filled,'' said Philip Haseltine, executive director of thecoalition, a lobbying group supported by the major automakers.   The study, based on 1,500 interviews, found that only 11 percentwho knew what air bags were disapproved of them, and 22 percent hadno opinion. Five percent had never heard of air bags.   ``I think it's difficult to educate the public about atechnology that's not available in large numbers,'' Haseltine said.``I think it's not so much a matter of somebody falling down on thejob.''   The public's knowledge of the passive restraints _ a termunfamiliar to 49 percent of the people surveyed _ likely willincrease as such systems become more common in cars, Haseltine said.   Cars sold in the United States beginning with the 1990 modelyear must be equipped either with air bags, which inflate during afrontal collision, or seat belts that automatically hook up whenthe door is closed or the engine started.   The nation's largest automaker, General Motors Corp., said thisweek it will install driver-side air bags as standard equipment on13 of its 1990 models.   Ford Motor Co. plans to equip 11 of its 1990 models with airbags, and Chrysler Corp., all of next year's models.   Eighty-two percent of the people surveyed said they would keepwearing safety belts even though their cars had air bags, and 65percent said they believed auto insurers should reduce rates onair-bag equipped vehicles.   The American Coalition for Traffic Safety's survey was conductedby telephone between March 20 and March 28, and had a 2.6 percentmargin of error.   The organization's members include the Big Three U.S. automakersand American Honda Motor Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
