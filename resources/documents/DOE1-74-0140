We inquired, whether anatomical stomach-shape,found at Turkish foreign workers, played a role in rising gastric complaints.Because of morphometrical evaluation of 188 stomach-X-rays taken fromTurkish patients it was possible to show, that an unusual high percentageof Turks had a gastric-curvatur-angle under 110 grade, meanwhile thegastric-curvatur-angle of native population, used in comparison, as arule was more than 130 grade. The found cascade-stomach of examinatedTurks seems to be a constant stomach-shape of this population-group andpossibly favours, apart from other factors, the development of gastricaffections.
