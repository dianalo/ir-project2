(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Medical students should be taught toavoid performing unnecessary coronary bypass surgery, says theauthor of a study that found unneeded operations may be more commonthan thought in the United States.   The study, published today in the British medical journalLancet, also found British doctors may perform coronary bypasssurgeries too infrequently, said Dr. Robert H. Brook, a Rand Corp.researcher and internist-geriatrician at the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles.   Brook said the findings suggest the United States could cuthealth care costs without having to ration needed cardiac care,while Britain already is rationing such care.   Brook and American and British colleagues conducted their studyby organizing two panels of doctors, one with nine U.S. physiciansand the other with nine from Britain. Each panel then rated the``appropriateness,'' or necessity, of two procedures for a seriesof hypothetical heart patients.   One procedure was coronary bypass, in which doctors try toprevent heart attacks and heart pain by surgically attaching newblood vessels to the heart to replace clogged arteries. The secondprocedure was coronary angiography, in which doctors search forblockages in coronary arteries by injecting dye into them and thenX-raying them.   The panels' review of hypothetical patients produced criteriafor determining when bypass surgery and angiography are necessaryor unnecessary. The researchers defined a procedure as appropriateif its benefit to health exceeeded its risks by a sufficiently widemargin. Cost was not a factor.   The researchers then applied those criteria to 386 coronarybypass operations performed on real Medicare patients in Washingtonstate. The British doctors' criteria deemed 35 percent of theoperations were unnecessary, while the U.S. doctors' criteriadeemed only 13 percent unnecessary.   More than 200,000 Americans undergo coronary bypass surgery eachyear, and some American studies suggest at least 25,000 of them, orabout 13 percent, are unnecessary, the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association reported last year.   Unnecessary bypass operations could be reduced if ``guidelinessuch as the ones we developed are promulgated and become anintegral part of education in medical school,'' Brook said Thursday.   Brook and his co-authors also found that Britain's 1985 rate of210 coronary bypass operations per million residents was only halfwhat it should have been if British doctors followed the Britishpanel's criteria.   The criteria developed by the British and U.S. doctors also wereapplied to 1,677 coronary angiographies performed on Medicarepatients throughout the United States and 376 performed on Medicarepatients in Washington state.   Under the British criteria, 42 percent of the angiographiesperformed nationally and 60 percent in Washington state were deemedunnecessary, while under the U.S. criteria, only 17 percent ofthose performed nationally and 27 percent of those in Washingtonstate were considered unnecessary.   About 680,000 coronary angiographies are performed annually inthe United States, according to the American Heart Association.   The study said British doctors apparently require morescientific evidence before determining if bypass surgery orangiography is necessary.   Brook said if American doctors followed their British colleaguesin emphasizing greater use of medicine and less bypass surgery totreat blocked coronary arteries, U.S. health care costs could bereduced without having to ration funds to provide bypass surgeryand angiography.   On the other hand, ``the findings imply effective care alreadyis being rationed'' in Britain, he said, adding that if furtherstudy confirms the results, Britain should seriously considermaking bypass surgery and angiography more widely available.   Brook's co-authors were Dr. J.R. Hampton, a cardiologist atBritain's University Hospital Nottingham; Jacqueline Kosecoff, aprivate consultant to Rand; Rand economist R.E. Park; and Drs. MarkChassin and Constance Winslow, both of whom work at Rand and UCLA.</TEXT></DOC>
