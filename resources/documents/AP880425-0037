The problems cited by the Communist Party daily were similar tothose the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the planton April 26, 1986.   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during theaccident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10years in a labor camp.   Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineeringjobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers,veterinarians and people without any higher education.   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve atany cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance ofextremely intricate equipment.''   ``Judging from all this, the leadership ... has not learned alesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as though there hasn'tbeen an accident.''   The explosion at the plant 80 miles north of the Ukrainiancapital of Kiev killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the worldand forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living nearby.   The scathing attack in Pravda was a departure from the numerousarticles appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary.   Previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipmentinstalled at Chernobyl, improved worker training, the decrease tosafe levels of radiation and the return of people to surroundingareas.   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant andthe production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity theresince the accident.   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region'sCommunist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organizationsupervising the plant and cleanup around it.   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors andwas not tested before being put into service despite seriousdefects, the newspaper said.   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plantwere not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed inconcrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports havestressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminalrecords, who had been excluded from the party or had receivedstrict party penalties,'' Pravda said.   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the businessthey were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians andpeople not having any higher education were working in engineeringposts,'' Pravda said.   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery andviolations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat'shead, and indicated he had been fired.   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity inthe evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations oforganizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.   The article indicated that plant managers tolerated theshortcomings because of a widespread problem in Soviet industry:pressure to fulfill a production plan.   The government has said it must increase the production ofnuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. TheChernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, hasbeen ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town forplant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-upcommission, denied at a Moscow news conference on Wednesday thatany major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
