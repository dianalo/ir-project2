We agreed ... that the job is not done,'' Bushsaid of the Afghan rebels' struggle to topple the Marxist regime inKabul.   The two leaders met for an hour with the Afghan situation thecenterpiece of their discussions.   Although many U.S. officials had expected the Soviet-backedKabul regime to fall shortly after the withdrawl of Red Army troopsin February, the rebel forces have been unable to topple the regimeof Najibullah. That has forced the administration to reconsider itsstrategy in the troubled region.   Pakistan, the third largest recipient of U.S. aid, hascooperated closely with the United States in aiding the Afghanrebel effort to topple the Kabul government.   Bush said he and Mrs. Bhutto had ``discussed ways to encourage apolitical solution in Afghanistan that will lead to a non-aligned,representative government ... to replace the illegitimate regime inKabul.   ``The United States and Pakistan will continue to explore anyserious avenue towards this end.''   Mrs. Bhutto, in her departure remarks, called her talks withBush ``instructive and fruitful,'' adding in regards to the Afghansituation, ``we are in complete accord with future policies.''   ``Pakistan remains fully committed ot a politcal solution'' inAfghanistan, she said.   Earlier, the two leaders exchanged warm remarks during theformal welcoming ceremony, held under leaden grey skies on theSouth Lawn of the White House.   Bush pledged to ``chart new ways to strengthen old bonds'' withPakistan, greeting Mrs. Bhutto as the living symbol of the renewalof democracy in her strategic nation.   ``The day of the dictator is over,'' declared Mrs. Bhutto.   The president noted that they are both new in their posts.   ``Let us craft new ideas, new initiative to meet the challegesof a changing world,'' Bush said.   He described Mrs. Bhutto as ``a living symmbol of those who riskall and sacrifice much so that others might know democracy andfreedom.''   Attired in a traditional white shawl, tunic and pants, the primeminister replied that she came to Washington to begin ``discussionsof a new relationship'' as both nations work to meet the ``newchallenges (that) confront us in the closing but complex phase ofthe Afghan war.''   The Washington Post reported today that the Bush administrationis considering the sale of 60 F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan at acost of $1.4 billion, but the two leaders made no mention of anysuch agreement in their welcoming remarks.   While Bush did not mention the ongoing Afghan rebel effort inhis initial remarks, he repeatedly praised Mrs. Bhutto's battle toreturn her nation to democratic rule. She assumed her duties sixmonths ago following her party's victory in national elections.   Mrs. Bhutto said the two nations have ``stood together aspartners'' in the attempt to restore freedom and independence toAfghanistan.   ``Our countries have developed a vital security relationship anda major program of economic cooperation. This has enabled Pakkistanto work with confidence for peace in our region,'' she said.   ``It was not so long ago that Pakistan was a dictatorship and Iwas in prison. But, as you said Mr. President, giving heart to allthose living under tyrany, the day of the dictator is over,'' shesaid.   After the welcoming ceremony and a meeting in the Oval Office,Mrs. Bhutto was to be the guest of honor at a State Departmentluncheon hosted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.   A White House state dinner was planned this evening followingmeetings Mrs. Bhutto had scheduled at the World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund.   During her two-day stay, agreements in the areas of narcoticscontrol, housing and education are to be signed. Also on the agendais the U.S. aid program for Pakistan, for which the administrationhas requested $380 million in economic assistance and $240 millionin military transfers for the next fiscal year. Pakistan is thethird largest recipient of U.S. aid.   But the principal focus of attention of her visit will be theunending civil war in Afghanistan, a conflict in which the UnitedStates and Pakistan have cooperated for years.   Although the Soviet Union completed the withdrawal of its forcesin February, Pakistan is still bearing the burden of 3 millionAfghan refugees as fighting continues between the Marxistgovernment in Kabul and the Afghan rebels. The insurgents have beenusing Pakistan as a launching pad for attacks inside Afghanistan.   In recent interviews, Mrs. Bhutto has indicated a desire for apolitical settlement. But she accepts the U.S. view that any suchagreement should not include Afghanistan's current leader,Najibullah, whose forces have proved remarkably resilient in theface of predictions his government would collapse following theSoviet withdrawal.
