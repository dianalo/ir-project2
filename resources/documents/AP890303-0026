While still in its formative stages, the new policy is outlinedin a secret 10-page document Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIshowed to House and Senate leaders Thursday during a hastilyarranged visit to Capitol Hill.   Baker made clear to lawmakers that he does not intend to abandonthe anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, who now are subsisting on U.S.supplies in Honduran jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border.   He told congressional officials he would seek to renew the U.S.``humanitarian'' aid, which runs out at the end of this month, for ayear, according to some present at the meetings. Aid would continueto flow at current rates _ about $4 million a month _ and would keepthe rebels available as a standby fighting force until afterNicaragua's national elections, which are being moved up to early1990.   But some participants said it was clear that the one-yearextension would be objectionable to congressional Democrats whooppose the Contra policy, and that it might be negotiable. Baker'stop objective for Central America remains to achieve a bipartisanconsensus on how to achieve democracy and peace in the region, theparticipants said.   ``They're trying to put something together that everybody canagree on, that both Democrats and Republicans can support,'' saidSen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who attended one meeting in the officeof Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   At the same time Baker was making the rounds, GuatemalanPresident Vinicio Cerezo also was calling on some of the samecongressional leaders to ask stronger U.S. support for last month'sregional peace agreement reached in El Salvador among the fiveCentral American presidents.   The pact calls for drafting a plan by mid-May that would disbandthe 11,000-man Contra force and provide for them to be assimilatedinto Nicaragua as the Sandinistas open up and democratize theirpolitical process, free political prisoners and hold new elections.   Bush has been cool to the plan, saying it is similar to pastSandinista promises which have not been kept and contains noenforcement mechanism to make sure the reforms are achieved. Bushreiterated his skepticism to Cerezo in a meeting on Thursday, saidWhite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the United Statesshould support the plan and seek to propel it forward. ``We ought tobe positive and supportive, and not pour cold water on it,'' Wrightsaid before a meeting with Cerezo.   But Wright, in a statement that seemed to fit in with Baker'sproposal, added: ``We have some leverage we can apply at the propermoment to reinforce the agreement and help make it work.''   Wright said that leverage could include lifting the current U.S.trade embargo on Nicaragua.   Sources in the administration and on Capitol Hill, all speakingon condition of anonymity, said Baker was considering lifting thatembargo as well as offering small economic incentives to helpNicaragua's failing economy if the Sandinistas live up to theirpledges of democratization.   Baker is also considering a range of possible U.S. actions thatcould include resumption of normalized relations on visas, airtravel, foreign aid and exchange of diplomats, said oneadministration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   While current aid to the Contras officially runs out March 31,supplies that have been bought by that date could continue to flowto the rebels and keep them supplied at least through April,congressional sources said. While the adinistration may propose itsnew aid package before Congress leaves town March 23 for a 10-dayEaster break, it is unlikely action will come before April.   Baker's discussions on Capitol Hill were seen in part as aneffort to get moving on Central America amid accusations that Bushhas been slow to get his foreign policy machinery off the ground.The administration apparently was taken by surprise by the agreementreached Feb. 14 by the five presidents in Costa del Sol, ElSalvador, and is scrambling to catch up.   The five countries are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,Honduras and Nicaragua.   ``Part of what's driving them (the Central American presidents)is our own policy vacuum,'' said an administration source who spokeon condition of anonymity. ``They had no idea what our policy waswhen they met.''   Baker's discussions with Congress were ``to get us out of thisvacuum,'' the source said.   Some congressional critics noted as well that the policyproposals apparently had not yet been cleared with the Contras orthe Central American presidents. ``This is a Washington plan, not aCentral American plan,'' said one Republican source.</TEXT></DOC>
