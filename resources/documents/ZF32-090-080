 Of the leading technologies, rewritable andWORM (Write Once, Read Many) are the two most suited for day-to-day onlineuse.andM;If you want both WORM and rewritable drives, you need to buy both.andP;  Not onlyis this expensive and space inefficient, it also means contending withmultiple SCSI host adapters and device drivers.andP;  In the case of a jukebox (aseries of 10 or so drives attended by a robotic arm), the problems multiplyuntil they are nearly unmanageable.andM;Pioneer brings users one step closer to a single optical-device solution withits DES7001 Multifunctional Drive, which operates in either WORM orrewritable mode.andM;Write Once, Write ManyandM;The key difference between rewritable and WORM is that the former technologyoffers the same functionality of a hard disk--reading, writing, and erasingfiles.andP;  WORM is essentially a permanent media--once a file is written, it'sthere to stay.andM;Although technologically similar, WORM and rewritable devices are suited tovery different applications.andP;  WORM is useful for long-term archival storage,for keeping multiple versions of the same files, and for use indocument-imaging systems in which an unchangeable copy of a document must bestored.andM;Rewritable devices, on the other hand, are well-suited to managing vastamounts of data which need to be changed.andP;  Desktop publishing, databasestorage, data acquisition, and CAD/CAM are some applications which greatlybenefit from rewritable optical-storage devices.andM;Offsetting the problem of speed--these technologies are far slower thanconventional magnetic hard disks--is their ability to handle high-capacityinterchangeable media.andP;  An average cartridge holds between 300-600Mb of dataper side, and costs approximately $100.andP;  When you begin to deal with multiplegigabytes of data, the cost per byte for optical storage becomes far cheaperthan the cost of conventional magnetic storage.andM;Magnets and LightsandM;To understand how the Pioneer works, it would help to know a little bit aboutoptical technology.andM;There are two technologies currently in use for rewritable technology:phase-change and magneto-optical (MO).andP;  MO, used in Pioneer drives, is themost stable and mature.andM;An MO drive writes data to the disk in a two-pass process.andP;  A laser heats anarea of the recording layer until it becomes susceptible to magnetization,and a magnet then changes the area's polarity.andP;  Because the magnet can onlychange the polarity one direction at a time (e.g., north to south), the firstpass resores the area to be written to a null state, and the second actuallyencodes the data.andM;To read data, the drive bounces a polarized beam off the media, takingadvantage of something called the Kerr effect.andP;  It turns out that thereflectivity of a material differs depending on its magnetic orientation, andthe drive's sensors can differentiate the zeros from the ones.andM;WORM is a lot simpler than MO.andP;  Essentially, a laser burns a pit into thesurface of the disk, and the change in the strength of the reflected beambouncing off the pit is what the drive reads as data.andM;One of the problems with WORM technology is that there is very littlestandardization, to the point that in some drives, a pit means a zero and inothers it means a one.andP;  As a result, you can't expect to read a disk writtenin one manufacturer's drive in anybody else's.andP;  The main reason for thedisparity, which is less prevalent for MO disks, is that the applicable ISOstandard was not finalized until after many devices had been produced.andM;PerformanceandM;The Pioneer DE-S7001 is a front-loading WORM/MO drive that can be placedeither vertically or horizontally.andP;  Based on a SCSI-1 (ANSI X 3.131-1986)interface, the drive claims an average seek time of 53ms, a burst-mode datatransfer rate of 1.5Mb per second, and a suned transfer rate of 491K persecond; it also has a 256K look-head buffer.andP;  Both WORM and rewritablecartridges have a capacity of 327Mb per side.andM;Pioneer's WORM uses an organic dye polymer-based media.andP;  On these disks,relatively cheap to manufacture, the laser heats the dye, which theninteracts with the substrate to form a pit.andM;In order to combine both WORM and MO functions in a single drive, the Pioneerunit uses a sampled servo format in which the data-servo areas are separated.andO;Each disk is preformatted and contains, among other things, informationtelling the drive which type of disk it is.andM;The review drive was installed and tested on a Gateway 2000 386/33, runningMS-DOS 4.01 with 8Mb of memory.andP;  The default settings on the host adapter anddrive did not conflict with any of the other devices in the system, whichincluded an Intel SatisFAXtion and a Future Domain SCSI adapter connected toa Pioneer 6 Disk Mini-Changer.andM;Setting up the drive involves the installation and configuration of the SCSIhost adapter, configuration of the drive, installing Correl DRIVER software,and high-level formatting the disk.andM;The 8-bit Corel SCSI card provides bus termination, and has both internal andexternal SCSI connectors.andP;  The card takes up 16K of UMB space (the areabetween 640K and 1,024K), and can be configured to any of eight baseaddresses.andP;  If you're using a memory manager which makes &quot;high memory&quot;available, you'll need to be sure to exclude the adapter's ROM.andM;The drive has two Centronics-style SCSI connectors.andP;  The unit can bedaisy-chained to other SCSI devices supported by Corel.andP;  A set of DIPswitches on the back allow you to select SCSI ID, set up the defaultoperating mode, turn the look-ahead buffer on or off, and enable or disabledparity checking.andM;Interrupt-DrivenandM;Installing Corel DRIVER is greatly simplified by an easy-to-use setupprogram, fairly complete online help screens, and a thorough set ofdocumentation.andP;  Corel DRIVER lets you run under DOS, OS/2, and NetWare, andallows you to format with a variety of sector and partition-size options.andP;  Apatch is supplied to create volumes larger than 32Mb, under DOS 3.3 andearlier.andM;Corel DRIVER operates through interrupt 21, so you'll have to use thesupplied CHKDSK and FORMAT analogues.andM;The utilities bundled with the driver allow you to format, check media,perform SCSI commands, test the unit, and change the driver parameters.andO;Additionally, a history program allows you to track multiple versions of thesame file when using the WORM functions of the drive.andM;Driving TasksandM;The drive performed well on a number of tasks, including: the PC MagazineDisk Performance benchmarks on the MO; creating, deleting and recreating a25Mb directory structure; and for the WORM, copying multiple versions of afile and using the history functions to step through the revisions.andM;The Corel DRIVER pack is an excellent kit and is essentially transparent tothe operating system.andP;  Despite the fact that it mediates through interrupt21, it does not require a TSR--unlike many other WORM device drivers.andM;The downside of that approach is the loss of some functionality that'snormally part of dedicated WORM file system, such as N/Hance Inc.'s WOFSDOS.andO;A dedicated WORM file system provides you with portability between operatingsystems, enhanced maintenance of revision tracking, and other WORM-specificutilities.andM;ConclusionsandM;The Pioneer LaserMemory DES7001 Multifunction Optical Drive is recommended.andO;A multifunction drive might mean that you can use the MO to keep temporarystorage, and clean them up before transferring them to WORM archives.andP;  Itcould let you maintain large amounts, both of changing data andrevision-tracked data, simply by changing cartridges.andP;  For a document-imagingsystem, you would have both the ability to perform forms processing and toarchive within the same jukebox system.andM;At $4,495 for an external drive or $4,495 for an internal, the Pioneer unitcosts half of what it would to have both a WORM and an MO.andM;In addition, by combining the two technologies into one drive, you don't haveto contend with two devices and their inevitable clutter andincompatibilities.andM;David A. Harvey is a journalist specializing in optical and multimediatechnologies and implementations.andP;  He can be reached on CampuServe at72007,2313 and a daharvey on both MCI Mail and BIX.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
