The authors now describe observations on proteolysis of human{alpha}{sub 2}M without concomitant hydrolysis of the internal thiolestersor conformational change. This proteolysis was obtained with a novelbacterial proteinase they recently used to isolate the receptor-bindingdomain from {alpha}{sub 2}M. This proteinase is not inhibited by {alpha}{sub2}M, and therefore it was possible to study its effect on native {alpha}{sub2}M at pH 4.5, conditions used previously to produce the receptor-bindingdomain. The major observations are that despite extensive proteolysis,{alpha}{sub 2}M largely retained its native conformation as shown byrate electrophoresis, the absence of binding of monoclonal antibody F2B2,and the incorporation of [{sup 14}C]methylamine into a 145-kDa fragmentof {alpha}{sub 2}M. These results demonstrate indirectly the particularrelation of the bait region to the internal thiolesters and illustratefurther the domain-structure of {alpha}{sub 2}M and the expression ofthe receptor-recognition site by activation of the internal thiolesters.</TEXT></DOC>
