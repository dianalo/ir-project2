The Proposed Rule sought toforeclose the use of so-called ``pocket rates'' by prescribing an effectivedate for rating purposes which is uniform and consistent with the dateon which the carrier assumes its contractual and regulatory obligationswith regard to the shipment.\1\<NOTE/> Interested persons were asked to comment on the ProposedRule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Pocket rates are described by one commenter as a tariffpractice whereby the carrier negotiates a rate, receives the cargo fromthe shipper, but only publishes the agreed rate in its tariff after thetransportation has begun. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Twenty-six comments were received by the Commission to the Proposed Rule.The two comments received from shipper organizations,\2\<NOTE/> and the four comments filed by the non-vessel  operatingcommon carrier (``NVOCC'') industry,\3\<NOTE/> argue that the Proposed Rule is unnecessary and anticompetitive,in that it would impair carrier ``flexibility'' to respond to shippersor changing market conditions. These shipper and NVOCC interests opposeany change in the tariff regulations in 46 CFR 580.5(d). One shipper group,Chemical Manufacturers Association, suggests that should an effective daterule be required, the ``bill of lading date'' be established as the relevantdate for rating purposes under the carriers' tariffs. The bill of ladingdate is said to be commercially significant, easily accessible to bothshipper and carrier, and easily verifiable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ These shipper groups are identified in Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ These NVOCC commenters are identified in Appendix B. Seven comments were filed on behalf of individual vessel operators (``VOCCs'').\4\<NOTE/> The VOCCs assert that the Proposed Rule, if implemented,would act to deprive shippers of rate flexibility and deprive carriersof the ability to compete by offering the lowest available rate to theirshippers. These commenters believe that the proposed Commission actionwould result in an increase in rate malpractices; an unmanageable risein tariff filings of all carrier rate quotations; and a reduction in theuse of intermodal services because of the later ``receipt'' date inherentin port-to-port services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Comments filed by VOCCs are identified in Appendix C.  Those VOCCs supporting a rule to prescribe an effective date for tariffrates and rules \5\<NOTE/> generally suggest that the relevant date for tariff ratingpurposes should be the sailing date of the vessel from the loading port.\6\<NOTE/> They assert that carriers are often unable to determine thedate of receipt of cargo by their agents and participating inland carriers;that carriers often find that they have received cargo <T3>prior </T3>to the publication of a negotiated rate due to failingsin the cargo booking process; and that the carriers have not experiencedproblems in application of the current rate effectiveness rule and do notperceive any discrimination or malpractice arising therefrom.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Pandamp;O Containers (TFL) Ltd.

Certain VOCCs expressed a preference for tariff alternativesbased on date of receipt or date of sailing/loading, whichever benefitsthe cargo.   The largest group of comments received were from conferences. Thirteencomments were filed on behalf of twenty-two conferences and ratemakingagreements.\7\<NOTE/> These comments reflect a diversity of positions with threecomments filed in opposition to the Proposed Rule, seven voicing theirapparent support for the concept and need for an effective date rule (butnot necessarily the Proposed Rule) and three comments favoring both theProposed Rule and its underlying rationale. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Comments filed by conference organizations are identifiedin Appendix D. Conferences opposing the Proposed Rule assert that there exists ``no demonstratedneed for'' the rule,\8\<NOTE/> that an effective date rule would burden conference carriersdisproportionately vis-a-vis independent lines, and that such a rule wouldbe inappropriate to particular trades or particular services.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Comments of Inter-America Freight Conference, at 2. Other conferences endorse the concept of an effective date rule as an appropriateremedy to retroactive ratemaking and pocket rate practices. These conferencesnonetheless assert that the Proposed Rule would create administrative difficultiesand could result in similarly situated shippers being treated differently.They differ, however, on what date should be prescribed for the effectivenessof tariff rates, rules or charges.\9\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>comments filed by the Australian and New Zealand Conferences;and by the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf/Western Mediterranean Rate Agreement,South Europe/U.S.A. Freight Conference, and Greece Westbound Conference.In virtually identical comments, these conferences conclude with mutuallyexclusive alternatives to the Proposed Rule, <T3>viz: </T3>date of sailing from <T3>last port </T3>of loading vs. date of sailing from <T3>port </T3>of loading, respectively. Three comments filed by conferences support the Proposed Rule. These includecomments by conferences in two of the most active U.S. trades: the NorthEurope-U.S. Gulf Freight Conference and North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conferenceand the Trans-Pacific Westbound Rate Agreement.\10\<NOTE/> Conferences supporting the Proposed Rule argue that it isnecessary to eliminate a ``loophole'' in the tariff publication requirementsby which carriers engage in practices which are discriminatory as betweenshippers, and competitively unfair as between carriers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Supporting comments also were filed by the MediterraneanNorth Pacific Coast Freight Conference. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>The Commission has determined to publish a Final Rule specifying the dateof receipt by the carrier (or its agent) as the effective date for tariffrating purposes. As set forth in greater detail below, the promulgationof a Final Rule is found to be appropriate and necessary (1) to prescribean effective date which is uniform and consistent with the date on whichthe carrier assumes its other contractual and regulatory obligations withrespect to the transportation, (2) to foreclose a potential avenue fordiscriminatory ratemaking, and (3) to maintain the integrity of the tarifffiling system. Maintenance of the regulatory <T3>status quo, </T3>or adoption of any of the several tariff rule formulationssuggested by the commenters as alternatives to the Proposed Rule, wouldhave the effect of sanctioning carrier rate practices which embody retroactiveratemaking and inadequate notice to the public of rates statutorily requiredto be set forth in the carrier's or conference's tariff.The Commission regulations at 46 CFR 580.5(d)\11\<NOTE/> currently allow a carrier or conference unilaterally to provideone or more effective dates for rating and compliance purposes, which datesmay differ from the time at which the transportation process commences.Tariff Rule 3 thus may operate to establish two rates applicable at thesame time to the same commodity_one being the rate currently publishedand made effective in the tariff at the time of tender of the goods, andthe second being an unpublished rate actually applied to the cargo. Consistentwith the tariff filing requirements of section 8(a) of the Shipping Actof 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707 (``1984 Act''), the Proposed Rule seeks toaddress this situation by prescribing a uniform effective date for ratingpurposes, based on the date of delivery to the carrier (or its agent) forpurposes of transport.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ This regulation requires each carrier to publish tariffrules governing its practices on specified subjects. As relevant, the regulationrequires tariff notice of the following: <ITAG tagnum="28">(3) Rate applicability rule. A clear and definite statement of thetime at which a rate becomes applicable to any given shipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">46 CFR 580.5(d)(3) (1988) (hereinafter referred to as ``Tariff Rule3''). Commission requirements in this regard have remained virtually unchangedsince 1975. </ITAG>With the enactment of the 1984 Act, Congress defined the boundaries ofthe Commission's jurisdiction as to matters such as through rates. Theprovisions of section 8(a) of the 1984 Act give    the Commission jurisdictionover ``through transportation''\12\<NOTE/> for tariff rate purposes from port or point of receipt toport or point of destination so long as the carrier ``assumes responsibility''\13\<NOTE/> for transportation between such ports or points. The Commission'sjurisdictional authority over the provision of through transportation thusbegins at the port or point of receipt, whether the cargo is tendered directlyto the ocean carrier or to another carrier under arrangement for throughtransport to destination.\14\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Defined in section 3(26) of the 1984 Act to mean: <ITAG tagnum="28">* * * continuous transportation between origin and destination forwhich a through rate is assessed and which is offered or performed by oneor more carriers, at least one of which is a common carrier, between aUnited States point or port and a foreign point or port. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See </T3>definition of ``common carrier'' set forth in section 3(6)of the 1984 Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The Commission was not, however, given jurisdiction overthe underlying inland carriers.The date transportation commences is the primary date on which federalregulation may begin pursuant to the commerce clause of the United StatesConstitution, U.S. CONST. art. 1, section 8, cl. 3. <T3>See Joy Oil Co. </T3>v. <T3>State Tax Comm., </T3>337 U.S. 286 (1949); <T3>Champlain Realty Co. </T3>v. <T3>Brattleboro, </T3>260 U.S. 366 (1922); <T3>Coe </T3>v. <T3>Errol, </T3>116 U.S. 517 (1886) (tax cases). <T3>See also Baltimore andamp; O.S.W.R.

Co. </T3>v. <T3>Sabine Tram Co., </T3>227 U.S. 111 (1913) (transportation cases). Thisoccurs when the goods have been delivered or tendered to a common carrierfor transportation beyond the state, or for transportation to another carrierfor export. <T3>Hammer </T3>v. <T3>Dagenhart, </T3>247 U.S. 251 (1918), <T3>overruled on other grounds, United States </T3>v. <T3>Darby </T3>312 U.S. 100 (1941); <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Freeman, </T3>239 U.S. 117 (1915); <T3>Southern Railroad Co. </T3>v. <T3>Reid, </T3>222 U.S. 424 (1912). In today's intermodal environment, the carrier's obligation is viewed ascommencing upon receipt of the shipper's cargo, whether that event occursat a port or at an inland point. It is at the point of receipt that a billof lading generally issues, representing the contract of carriage. Themutual obligations of the carrier to perform the transportation requestedand of the shipper to pay the freight costs thereof, accrue on the former'sacceptance of the goods. It is also at this point that insurance coveragemay begin, and title to the goods may pass between shipper and consignee.Adoption of the Proposed Rule would therefore conform carrier practicesas to rate effectiveness with the many commercial and regulatory incidentsof the carrier's undertaking, which begin upon the receipt of the goodsfor transportation.\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Additional precedent for the action taken here can befound in the Commission's domestic offshore tariff requirements, 46 CFRPart 550. The Commission requires that the rates applicable to joint throughmovements in the domestic offshore trades be the rates published and ineffect on the day the initiating carrier takes possession of the shipment,46 CFR 550.5(b)(8)(ii). These provisions were implemented without significantcontroversy, or subsequent problems in their enforcement.  As currently structured, Tariff Rule 3 may render uncertain the shipper'scharges under its contract with the carrier because   one or more ``effectivedates'' may be established as the points of reference for calculating theapplicable freight rate.\16\<NOTE/> In such cases, the actual amount of the shipper's financialobligation for the freight is effectively unknown at time of tender, asit remains subject to (1) the transportation operations or exigencies ofthe carrier in moving any given shipment from port or point of receiptto the vessel for loading; and (2) the carrier's tariff activities in theinterim period between the date of receipt by carrier (or originating carrier)and the date of loading aboard vessel. <T3>See. e.g., </T3>Comments of Forest Lines, Inc., at 2 (carrier's standardpractice is to make tariff rate effective on date of loading on ocean-goingvessel); Comments of Ocean Star Container Line, A.G., at 4 (carrier proposesuniform rule that date of rate effectiveness be fixed as date vessel sailsfrom port of loading).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Tropical Shipping and Construction Co. Ltd.'s tariffprovides an exemplar of the effective date rule as implemented by numerousocean common carriers under the current regulation: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Effective date of rate changes. </T3>Rates and charges herein are thosein effect on the date the vessel sails from the port of loading or thedate the cargo is received at carrier's terminal, whichever benefits thecargo. <ITAG tagnum="28">Tropical Shipping andamp; Construction Co. Ltd. Comments, attachmentat 1.</ITAG>In these instances, the absence of a clear and definite statement of therate applicable to the shipment at the time the transportation commencesmay render doubtful the validity of the contract. 17 Am. Jur. 2d <T3>Contracts </T3>section 82 (agreement which leaves price for futuredetermination or agreement by parties is not binding); <T3>Id. Contracts </T3>section 83 (reservation to one party of future rightto determine price renders contract too indefinite to be enforceable).Rates made applicable to cargo after transportation has already commencedappear to be a form of retroactive ratemaking which is prohibited by section8 of the 1984 Act. As the Commission's jurisdiction over the transportationbegins on the date the transportation commences, its jurisdiction overthe <T3>rate </T3>for such transportation also attaches from the date of tenderto the carrier. Tariff Rule 3, however, currently permits the carrier toestablish a date for rating purposes which may, but need not, be the samedate on which the carrier assumes its contractual obligations to the shipperand its regulatory obligations to the Commission. This is no longer acceptable.The Commission's jurisdiction should be construed in a manner that is uniformand consistent for all purposes, and not be subject to variance as to timein the matter of rate applicability. Further, section 8(a) of the 1984 Act obligates the carrier to show inits tariffs ``all'' its rates, charges and practices applicable to cargotendered thereunder. We do not believe that this obligation is met wherea carrier, already in the process of transporting cargo subject to a rateagreed to with a shipper, does not actually file that rate in an FMC tariffuntil some later point in the cargo's journey, <T3>e.g</T3>., immediately prior to vessel loading. The carrier thus mayhave two rates applicable to the same commodity_one being the rate currentlypublished in the carrier's tariff at the time of tender; and the secondbeing an unpublished rate, which in fact will ultimately be applied tothe cargo. The carrier's tariff operates to permit a future act of tariffpublication to ``relate back'' to shipments already in transit, imposinga new rate over the rate then applicable.''\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ By analogy, Commission tariff regulations prohibit thepublication of any rate which would ``duplicate or conflict with'' existingrates in the same tariff on the same commodity, 46 CFR 580.6(k)(1). Several commenters assert that tariff policy should be to permit the ``immediate''effectiveness of all rate reductions to shippers.\18\<NOTE/> Nothing in the statute or its legislative history, however,even suggests that rate reductions were intended to apply retroactively.In fact, the contrary is true.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>See, e.g</T3>., Opposition of International Association of NVOCCs,at 1-3; and Comments of National Industrial Transportation League, at 6-7,<T3>citing </T3>Informal Docket No. 1601(F), <T3>3M Company </T3>v. <T3>Inter-American Freight Conference </T3>24 SRR 728 (ALJ, 1987). Section 18(b) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (``1916 Act''), <T3>formerly </T3>46 U.S.C. 817, is the predecessor to the tariff filingprovisions of section 8(a) of the 1984 Act.\19\<NOTE/> The original version of section  18(b), which was the subjectof lengthy hearings,\20\<NOTE/> prescribed a 30-day notice for all rate changes, whetherincreases or decreases. In response to shipper and carrier testimony, thebill was amended to delete the 30-day notice for rate decreases. The primaryconcern appears to have been that requiring such notice in U.S. exporttrades would give an unfair advantage to foreign competitors of U.S. manufacturerswho were not constrained by a similar requirement.\21\<NOTE/> It was made clear during this testimony however, that ratereductions were intended to be prospective from the date of filing.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Prior to the 1961 amendments to the 1916 Act, requiringtariff filing by carriers and conferences operating in U.S. internationaltrades, the Commission's predecessors had, by rule, required the filingof tariffs of export rates pursuant to the authority of section 19 of theMerchant Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. app. 876). Changes in those rateswere required to be filed within 30 days <T3>after </T3>their effective date.

Certain precedents established under section 8(e) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C.app. section 1707(e), as to the Commission's remedial authority over clericaland administrative tariff filing errors, underscore the legislative purposein requiring adequate notice of available freight rates through tariffpublication.

In the cited decision, the AdministrativeLaw Judge remarked upon the conflict between Commission precedent in thearea of section 8(e) ``special docket'' proceedings and Tariff Rule 3 asimplemented by the carrier. The Commission believes that either maintenance of the tariff status quoor adoption of a rule permitting rate changes to become effective as ofthe date of sailing would defeat the underlying Congressional purposesfor the filing of tariffs. A tariff rule based on any of the several alternativeformulations offered by the commenters would continue retroactive ratemakingpractices and sanction inadequate notice to the shipping public of therates at which the carrier is holding out, to some, to provide transportation.During the period between agreement upon the commodity rate and its subsequentpublication, the unpublished (but agreed to) rate remains for all intentsa secret rate between that shipper and carrier.

We believe there is a clear potential for discriminationbetween shippers in situations where one shipper has access to rates notyet filed in any tariff, while a second shipper does not. Any such discriminationwould be no less real for the fact that the second shipper remains unawareof the rate arrangement, and thus cannot complain. The fact is similarshippers would not be receiving like treatment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Comments of National Industrial Transportation League,at 5; Comments of Chemical Manufacturers Association, at 4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Letter comments of Israel Eastbound Conference, at 2;Comments of Waterman Steamship Corp., at 1. One of the principal arguments asserted in opposition to a ``date of receipt''rule is that any change in the tariff subsequent to receipt of some cargomay result in two shippers paying different rates for the same commodityon the same vessel. This argument is raised in nine of the twenty-six comments,and generally assumes that the earlier shipper will be prejudiced becauseit would not obtain the benefit of a subsequent rate reduction. These commentersgenerally favor an alternative to the Proposed Rule based on the date ofvessel loading or of sailing. A rule of the type suggested by these commenters, permitting rate changesto apply to all cargo on the same voyage, is itself subject to shipperdiscrimination. For example, a rule establishing the date of sailing asthe effective date would permit rate reductions to apply retroactivelyto cargo already received by the carrier and in the process of being transported.\28\<NOTE/> Likewise, rate increases which become effective as of thedate of sailing would apply retroactively to cargo already received bythe carrier and in transit. This result would appear to be inconsistentwith the spirit, if not the language, of the statute's 30-day notice requirementfor rate increases. We also expect it would not be any better receivedby the shipper community in general.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ One commenter, the International Association of NVOCCs(IANVOCC), asserts that shippers are ``entitled'' to benefit from any ratereductions filed by the carrier subsequent to shipment, notwithstandingtheir retroactive effect. Opposition of IANVOCC, at 1. The competitive consequences of pocket rate practices directly affect thecarrier industry as well. A carrier cannot market its services effectivelyon a rate basis when the cargo is already moving at the time a competingcarrier publishes the applicable new rate. Competition is therefore diminished(or alternatively, the carriers may respond in kind through undisclosedrate arrangements with other shippers, in a rapidly proliferating carrierpractice). Similarly, a carrier who is approached for a rate reductionbased  on a competitor's rate quote is left without a basis to gauge thereal or apparent accuracy of the quoted rate, or to assess the true competitiveneed for equal (or greater) rate reductions. Rate flexibility alone is not a reason to forgo regulation of this aspectof carrier ratemaking, given its potential for rate instability and discrimination.The rule which the Commission is adopting is intended to restrict thosetariff practices which may give rise to unlawful methods of competition.<T3>See e.g.</T3>, sections 10(b) (6), (10), (11) and (12) of the 1984Act. <T3>See also</T3>, <T3>Rates</T3>, <T3>Charges and Practices of L. andamp; A. Garcia andamp; Co.</T3>, 2 U.S.M.C.615, 617-19 (1941) (discounting of tariff rate pursuant to ``confidential''arrangement with shipper held violation of sections 16 and 17 of ShippingAct, 1916); <T3>Section 19 Investigation, 1935, supra</T3>, 1 U.S.S.B.B. at 502 (statutoryprohibitions against undue and unreasonable preferences give rise to obligationon every common carrier to make all its rates public and available on equalterms). Upon consideration of the comments, the 1984 Act and its legislative history,and existing case law, the Commission has determined to adopt the ProposedRule as a Final Rule,\29\<NOTE/> so as to prescribe an effective date for rating purposeswhich is uniform and consistent with the date on which the carrier assumesits   contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to the transportation.\30\<NOTE/> This Final Rule is intended to foreclose a potential avenuefor <T3>post hoc </T3>ratemaking and to avoid the potential discriminatoryand detrimental effects of such rates and practices both as to shippersand carriers. The Final Rule should also serve to provide a fairer, moreopen and informed competitive environment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ One language clarification has been made in the FinalRule. The reference in the Proposed Rule to ``ocean carrier'' has beenchanged to ``common carrier.'' Use of the term ``common carrier,'' whichis defined earlier in Part 580, makes it abundantly clear that the requirementsof the rule apply equally to NVOCCs and VOCCs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Comments not specifically addressed herein were nonethelessconsidered by the Commission and found to be either irrelevant, withoutmerit or subsumed within other comments expressly addressed. The Commission has determined that this regulation is not a ``major rule''as defined in Executive Order l2291, dated February 27, 1981, because itwill not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovations, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Commission finds that the Final Rule is exempt from the requirementsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601. Section 601(2) of thatAct excepts from its coverage any ``rule of particular applicability torates or practices relating to such rates * * *'' As the Final Rule relatesto particular applications   of rates and rate practices, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act requirements are inapplicable. The collection of information requirements contained in this regulationhave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, and have been assignedOMB control number 3072-0009.Public reporting burden for complying with this amendment regarding theeffective date of tariff changes is estimated to average 20 minutes perresponse, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding this burdenestimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, includingsuggestions for reducing this burden, should be sent to Federal MaritimeCommission, Bureau of Domestic Regulation; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 580 </ITAG>Maritime carriers; Rates and fares; Reporting and record keeping requirements.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553; secs. 8, 9, 10 and 17 of the ShippingAct of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707, 1708, 1709, and 1716, the Federal MaritimeCommission amends Part 580 of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulationsas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 580_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
