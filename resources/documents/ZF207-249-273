(Data TranslationInc.)(image processing)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Curran, Lawrence.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Data Translation Inc, an add-in board vendor, is venturing intothe semiconductor business and already has three CMOS devicesready for commercial use.andP;  Two of the chips are used forcolor-image processing because they are capable of converting red,green, and blue signals into hue, saturation, and intensityvalues.andP;  The chips cost $63 each in lots of 1,000.andP;  The third chipis the interface for IBM's Micro Channel bus, containing much ofthe circuitry needed for IBM PS-2 Micro Channel boards andcontrollers, and is sold in lots of 1,000 for $31 each.andP;  There areno known chips that offer the same conversion algorithms as DataTranslation's color-image processing chips, but its bus interfacechip will have plenty of competition.andP;  Data Translation plans along-term invasion of the chip market with more to come.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Data Translation Inc.
