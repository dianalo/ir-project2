The investigation,designed to complement a previous organic geochemical evaluation of sourcerocks, has provided information on clay mineral suites and the influenceof burial diagenesis. Six types of clay identified in the sequence areillite, kaolinite, chlorite, smectite, illite-smectite, and a clay mineralfrom the serpentine group. Illite and chlorite, present in varying proportionsthroughout the sequence, are considered to have detrital origins. Kaoliniteis confined to the late Permian and Trassic part of the sequence andreflects a change in source area and climate. Illite-smectite mixed layerclay has a more restricted and irregular distribution than other claytypes and is mainly associated with lacustrine facies. Burial diagenesisappears to have played a minor role in controlling clay mineral distribution.In the illite-smectite mixed-layer clay, no correlation exists betweenincrease in illite interlayers and increasing depth; furthermore, fora given percentage of illite interlayers, corresponding temperaturesare too low compared with published data. However, through lack of adequatesampling, it has not been possible to assess properly the role of smectite-illitediagenesis in the sequence. Nevertheless, available evidence suggeststhat detrital controls of clay mineral distribution have been more importantthan clay diagenesis. Therefore, it appears that clay mineral suitesin the northern Galilee Basin are unsuitable as indicators of level oforganic maturation. Most organic matter is concentrated in late Permiancoal-forming facies and is closely associated with illite clay. 21 refs.,4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
