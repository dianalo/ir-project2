The once-prominent Washington defense lawyer will serve his timeat the Federal Correctional Institution at Petersburg, Va.,according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Washington.   Borders surrendered quietly, going through a back entrance to theU.S. courthouse without speaking to reporters.   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Bordersincarcerated Tuesday after holding the lawyer in civil contempt ofcourt at the Senate's request.   Borders can free himself by answering a Senate impeachmentcommittee's questions, or he can wait for release until the Senatevotes on impeaching Hastings, probably not before mid-October.   Borders refused to answer 10 questions from Sen. Arlen Specter,R-Pa., about impeachment charges against Hastings, a 52-year-oldU.S. district judge from Florida.   Granted immunity from prosecution for what he might tell thecommittee, Borders was ordered by the court to testify but refused.He argued that the questions violated his constitutional rights,including the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.   Hastings is accused of plotting with Borders in 1981 to obtain a$150,000 payoff and of lying about it to a jury that acquitted himin 1981. Borders was convicted in a separate trial, disbarred andserved 33 months in prison.   Despite the acquittal, the House in August 1988 approved 17articles of impeachment against Hastings, charging him with thepayoff conspiracy, perjury and improper disclosure of informationobtained from a court-approved wiretap.   The committee will produce a report on the evidence againstHastings, and the Senate then will vote on whether to remove himfrom the bench.   The questions posed by Specter on Tuesday ranged from whetherHastings received any payoff money to the alleged relationshipbetween Borders and the late Florida organized crime boss SantoTrafficante.   Borders replied to each question by citing a statement he madeJuly 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee. Thestatement said the questions violated his rights.   Borders also objected on the grounds that since Specter was theonly senator on hand for the session, a quorum of the committee wasnot present.   Specter, however, reminded him of a resolution providing that onesenator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony fromBorders.</TEXT></DOC>
