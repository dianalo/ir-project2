Government warplanes and helicopters pounded rebel positionsnear the armed forces headquarters, but troops had held their firein the country's financial center, saying they didn't want toendanger Christmas shoppers.   The government said it had defeated the coup attempt that nearlyousted Mrs. Aquino on Friday and described today's fighting asmopping up operations. At least 42 people have been killed and morethan 200 wounded.   Mutineers were reported, however, to still hold an air base inthe central Philippines.   Hundreds of rebels swarmed over the financial center of Makati,where many foreign diplomats and businessmen live, and roamedthrough affluent shopping centers. Rebels also entered theIntercontinental Hotel and barred non-guests. At about 11 p.m.gunfire broke out near the hotel, with snipers firing towardloyalist troops.   Witnesses said pro-government units of the Capital Command weremoving toward the Intercontinental and the nearby, Japanese-ownedManila Garden Hotel with armored vehicles.   Earlier, gunmen fired at the home of Foreign Secretary RaulManglapus, but he was not there. Gunmen also killed 14 soldiers anda bystander, but police said the assailants may have been Communistinsurgents unconnected to the coup.   The military said it captured a coup leader early today, andanother renegade officer believed to be behind the coup issued astatement urging citizens to support the military mutiny.   A radio station broadcast what it said was a statement by thesuspected leaders of Friday's coup attempt demanding Mrs. Aquinoresign to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government.   Sporadic fighting continued near Camp Aguinaldo, headquarters ofthe armed forces near Manila. Jets and helicopter gunships strafedand rocketed suspected rebel positions, forcing thousands ofcivilians to flee their homes.   Air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000 pro-governmenttroopers near Camp Aguinaldo, mistaking them for mutineers. Atleast six of the loyalist soldiers were killed and 20 wounded.   Manila's international airport remained closed for a second day,and all domestic flights from the capital were canceled.   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who was fired as defenseminister after a failed coup in 1986, said the situation showed thegovernment had lost control of most of its 160,000-member military.   Friday's assault by rebellious members of the army and marineswas the sixth attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino since she was swept topower in the 1986 civilian-military uprising that ousted FerdinandMarcos.   The rebels attacked the presidential palace, military garrisonsand television stations, prompting Mrs. Aquino to ask for U.S. F-4Phantom fighters to provide air cover for her counterattackingforces. President Bush authorized the aid, and the rebels abandonedmost of the bases they had overrun.   The opposition Nacionalista Party of Vice President SalvadorLaurel condemned the decision to call for U.S. help as a ``brazenviolation and insult'' to national sovereignty.   A statement issued in the name of renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan also denounced Mrs. Aquino for requesting U.S.support. The statement, delivered to news organzations and writtenin ink, urged citizens to support mutineers for ``the attainment ofa genuine Filipino government.''   The government has never publicly identified Honasan as a leaderof the latest coup attempt. But rebel sources said he was among thekey planners. Honasan, who backed a movement to reform themilitary, led an August 1987 coup attempt that also nearly toppledthe government. He remains at large.   Meanwhile, Maj. Jose Gutierrez said one of the coup leaders, Lt.Col. Tito Legazpi, was arrested after taking part in an attack onthe Sangley Point naval air station outside Manila, which therebels briefly held. It was one of the sites U.S. warplanes flewover to provide air cover to pro-government forces. U.S.authorities said the American warplanes fired no shots.   Legazpi was a Honasan associate wanted for the August 1987 coupattempt. Gutierrez said four other people were captured withLegazpi.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital RegionDefense Command, said he expected government forces to ``finishoff'' the rebels by the end of the day. But attacks by thegovernment's helicopter gunships continued near sunset.   In the working-class district of Navotas, gunmen in a passengerjeep fired at a Capital Command station, killing 14 soldiers and acivilian, and fleeing with the victims' pistols. Police said thekillers may have been Communist rebels taking advantage of thechaos caused by the coup attempt.   During a nationally televised news conference, Mrs. Aquino said:   ``We shall not entertain any offer to negotiate from those whohave shamelessly betrayed the solemn oath of a soldier to defendthe Constitution. We leave them two choices: surrender or die.''   She identified 12 officers, whom she promised would be hunteddown for their role in the coup attempt.   They included Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, commander of theMactan Air Base in Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila. The baseremained under rebel control.   In Legazpi, 220 miles southeast of Manila, mutineers agreed toevacuate the city airport after talks with local officials andpriests. They surrendered their vehicles but were allowed to returnto their barracks with their weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
