Maybe they'll get used to it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev issued adecree setting April 2 as the effective date for along-anticipated package of price increases that will doubleand triple the cost of nearly half of consumer products --and raise tenfold the price of some scarce goods, such ascars. Transportation and communication prices will also goup.   But for months now, prices in state shops all over Moscowhave been rising with little official explanation.   The de facto increases, which are only partly authorized,suggest that the new government program could beanti-climactic. Already, many products are being sold atnegotiated prices, independent of the state, which hastraditionally kept prices low.   So far, the government has headed off the public outcryand panic buying seen last year when price increases werefirst mentioned, partly by promising to compensate consumersfor 85% of the hikes. It is expected to announce specificincreases in salaries and pensions today. Prime MinisterValentin Pavlov indicated that compensation would averageabout 60 rubles ($36 at the commercial exchange rate) perperson per month.   It could be that consumers are already used to risingprices. &quot;The general public is ready to accept price reform,which wasn't the case a year ago,&quot; says Andrei Zdravomyslov,president of the Soviet Sociological Association. &quot;People noweven want to have the new prices,&quot; in hopes of greatersupplies for the goods and services they need, he said.   Valentina Sherokova, a housewife, was purchasing sausagethis week at 19 rubles a kilogram ($5 a pound), more thantriple the price set by the state. &quot;It's insanely expensive,&quot;she complains, but takes comfort in the fact that she hassomething in the refrigerator for guests.   &quot;It's quite normal. If you want eggs, you pay for them,&quot;says Dmitri Kuznetsov, a student at Moscow State University.   State officials say the increases are the result of acomplicated cycle of shortages and higher raw-material coststhat left stores empty last year. In order to have anythingto sell at all, some state stores are negotiating withwholesalers to get supplies, and passing on the higher coststo customers. These so-called contract prices are toleratedby the government, but only for some food products andhigh-quality consumer goods.   Higher prices are the result of &quot;the insufficiency ofstate resources,&quot; says Ivan Gorbachev, deputy chairman of thestate committee on pricing.   Eggs sold at state prices disappeared from Mrs.Kuzmenichka's store last year. She has a good supply nowbecause local authorities recently permitted her to offerhigher prices to the farm association, and charge more toconsumers.   Such haphazard increases are a new phenomenon in theSoviet Union. Until recently, the state price committeestrictly regulated the sales price of all goods. The onlyexceptions were at small, private markets where farmers cansell food in excess of their state-planned production quotas,charging whatever consumers will pay.   Low prices in state stores were long considered one of themain benefits of socialism, and the government willingly paidout huge subsidies. As a result, some prices haven't changedin decades. The Moscow subway, for example, costs only fivekopecks (officially less than three U.S. cents) a ride; aloaf of bread costs only 20 kopecks.   The government is still trying to maintain some priceregulation, but the current situation makes regulation moredifficult. State stores that negotiate prices directly withfactories, for example, aren't supposed to charge consumersmore than 30% above the state-set prices. But retailers suchas Mrs. Kuzmenichka ignore the restrictions. She sells eggsfor 60% more than the state price, a practice Mr. Gorbachevof the state pricing committee says is &quot;technically illegal.&quot;   Naturally, some consumers agree. Bewildered by the&quot;technically illegal&quot; price increases, many refuse to paythem. But the alternative is grim: Buying produce at regularstate-set prices means having to stand in lines, frequentlyfor lower-quality products. Tanya Antonova, a hairdresserwaiting to buy meat at a state store, says her salary isn'tbig enough to pay more than the subsidized state price. Butafter standing for 15 minutes in a long line that barelymoved, she walked away emptyhanded.   Illegal or not, Mrs. Kuzmenichka's high-priced eggs wereselling briskly this week. Klavdia Galavina, a pensioner,walked out with 10 eggs in a bright orange net bag. Shewonders, &quot;How can we live with these prices?&quot;   A woman who would only identify herself as Ludmillacarefully placed 40 eggs into her shoddy canvas bag. Theywere for her husband's birthday celebration, she said. Atelephone operator for an ambulance station, she seemedunbothered by the price.   &quot;I'm not worried,&quot; she said. &quot;They will raise oursalaries.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
