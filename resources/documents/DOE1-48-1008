From detailed p-{gamma},p-e{sup -}, and p-{gamma}-{gamma} coincidence measurements, a level schemethat includes 16 excited states has been established. A 14.3-ns isomeris observed and is believed to correspond to the 7{sup -} isomers prevalentin the lighter even-mass platinum nuclei. Limited comparisons are madewith the U(5) and O(6) symmetries of the interacting boson model.</TEXT></DOC>
