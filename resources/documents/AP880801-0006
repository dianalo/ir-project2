The television spot, paid for by the Canadian government, is theonly state-sponsored message of its kind ever used to fightapartheid.   It's being broadcast in Toronto as part of a ``Rekindle theLight'' festival surrounding a meeting of eight Commonwealthforeign ministers that starts today and will examine ways to combatwhite rule in South Africa.   There's a public forum, film premiere and exhibition of photosand posters banned in South Africa. Tonight, during a jazz concerton the shores of Lake Ontario, thousands will be asked to light ananti-apartheid candle. Those at home are invited to put a candle intheir window.   ``We think we can make a difference,'' said Foreign Minister JoeClark, referring to the dominance Canada gives to the South Africanissue in its foreign policy.   The two-day meeting of the special committee of foreignministers will consider:   _Canadian proposals for countering South African censorship andpropaganda through measures including the beaming of short-waveradio broadcasts into the country from neighboring states.   _A review of the effectiveness of economic sanctions againstSouth Africa and ways to broaden them.   _A study of Pretoria's international financial links, includinggold sales, continued access to loans and the effects of corporatedivestment from South Africa.   _And a report by Nigeria's former head of state, Maj. Gen.Olusegun Obasanjo, on the military needs of black front-line states.   ``There will not be dramatic progress on any question here _it's not that kind of a meeting,'' Clark said Monday, explainingthat any recommendations must go to the entire 49-nationCommonwealth, which meets again in Malaysia next year.   The foreign ministers' committee was established at the lastCommonwealth summit in Vancouver in October 1987, and envoys takingpart come from Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania,Zambia and Zimbabwe.   Britain, whose colonial past links all member countries, isconspicuously absent because Prime Minister Margaret Thatcheropposes sanctions against South Africa.   The British are on board, however, when it comes to militarytraining to neighboring Mozambique and Zimbabwe, noted CommonwealthSecretary General Shridath Ramphal.   Ramphal said he hoped the meeting establishes ``the machinery''for more military training. Canada ruled out anything but``non-lethal'' aid.   Ramphal had reservations about Canadian proposals for counteringSouth African news censorship. He said it was ``tooone-dimensional'' to beam more news into the country, when gettingnews out is more urgent.   ``We have not been as energetic in getting the truth out bynon-conventional means and sources as the Western media has been inAfghanistan,'' he said.   South African state-of-emergency regulations in effect since1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions,treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range ofstatements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of theregulations has not been comprehensive.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control theeconomy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks,who have no vote in national affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
