People concerned with the issue said it now may be impossible forCongress to get an increase unless the Constitution is amended totake the decision away from Congress.   And they say it may be impossible to get a constitutionalamendment through state legislatures unsympathetic to Washington'swants.   In fact, said political scientist R. Kent Weaver of the BrookingsInstitution, the only state legislators likely to support aconstitutional amendment are ``those who want to go to Congress, andthen it would be used against them.''   The constitutional change most often discussed would create anindependent body to fix the government's top salaries, with Congressbarred from playing any role.   ``But the talk show hosts of American would have a field day withthat, too,'' says former Rep. William Ratchford, D-Conn., who was amember of the presidential commission that recommended the 51percent raise roundly rejected Tuesday in the Capitol.   Radio talk show hosts mounted an anti-raise campaign that helpedmotivate Congress to abandon plans to let the pay boost take quiet,automatic effect at midnight.   ``The first time a constitutional amendment worked,'' saidRatchford, ``there would be an effort to repeal the amendment.''   Nonetheless, argued William M. Agee, another commission member,``we need to take it out of the political arena. There has to be away this issue is depoliticized.'' Agee is chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, Idaho, a bigshipbuilding, engineering and construction outfit.   An amendment appears necessary because the constitution seems tosay that fixing its pay is a congressional responsibility. It saysmembers ``shall receive a compensation for their services, to beascertained by law.''   Former Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee onceproposed altering the Constitution to let the Supreme Court fixcongressional pay. He has said Congress ``is institutionallyincapable of setting its own salary.''   Critics asked who would set the court's pay, and when Baker saidCongress would the idea was rejected as a classic case ofbackscratching.   ``Well, it leaves the country with a problem,'' said former Sen.Charles McC. Mathias, R-Md., also a member of the commission. ``Theproblem is that we postponed it (a pay raise for the top levels ingovernment) for too many years and postponing it further is simplygoing to aggravate the problem.''   ``The reason we recommended 50 percent is because the smallpercentage increases were not taken year by year, and thatdifficulty will only grow bigger as long as we wait,'' he added.   One idea afloat in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote called forletting Congress vote for a pay raise for the new Congress, the onethat will be elected in November 1990.   ``It wouldn't work,'' said Weaver. ``Opponents would have twoyears to knock it down. They could attach a repeal to every billthat came along.''   Another solution _ mentioned by Mathias, Agee and Weaver _ is tobreak the custom by which congressional salaries rise in lockstepwith executive and judicial salaries.   They suggested that Congress could give judges and governmentofficials a raise without taking one itself. That solution alwayshas been rejected by congressmen who felt their worth was no lessthan a judge's or a bureaucrat's.   ``If they could delink themselves, and say, OK, we will not votefor a raise for ourselves but we will allow one for the executivebranch and the juduciary to go through, it seems to me that would bea great act of statesmanship,'' said Agee. ``Then they could try topass, say, a 20 percent increase for themselves.''</TEXT></DOC>
