He also saw damage to the United States and other industrialcountries.   ``Various sources estimated that the drop in imports by LatinAmerica cost the United States more than 900,000 jobs between 1980and 1987, including both the jobs that disappeared and those whichcould have been created if Latin America and the Caribbean had nothad to curb their imports,'' he said.   The organization's general assembly meets in Washington for aweek beginning Monday, with 32 governments represented. Brazil willhave its first popular election for president in 29 years on Nov.15.   ``For many groups of people, the reduction of income and thelack of jobs have been added to previous frustrations, so thatthere is a serious lack of basic necessities,'' he told theexecutive committee that was preparing the Washington session.   ``This situation is certainly a threat to the stability of thedemocracies that are in the process of consolidating themselves.''   He said that in 1988, in the worst crisis since the 1930s,average income was down 1.6 percent _ bringing it to the level of1978. All except five countries saw incomes decline, and in ninecountries the level was down to that of 20 years before.   In Venezuela, the average income was calculated at $4,543 lastyear, the same as in 1964.   Soares noted there had been serious disturbances this yearbecause of the economic situation. He did not name countries butwas clearly referring to last February's riots in Venezuela inwhich hundreds of people were killed, and the agitation inArgentina that brought the resignation of President Raul Alfonsinbefore the end of his term.   The committee calculated the outflow of cash as totalling $204billion since 1980, peaking at $35 billion in 1985, then decliningfor two years but rising again to $31.5 billion in 1988.   It laid the blame on a marked reduction in the flow of capitalfrom abroad, the high level of Latin American payments on foreigndebt and the flight of capital from Latin America to ``safehavens'' abroad.   It quoted figures to show Argentina, for example, spent 20percent of its budget on education in 1972 but only 6 percent in1986. Mexico spent 5.1 percent on health in 1972 and only 1.4percent in 1986.   ``The lack of government spending on things like education andhealth have disproportionately severe effect on the lowest incomegroups in the member states,'' the report said.   ``The poor do not have the means for private health care andeducation when public services are no longer available.''</TEXT></DOC>
