Bowier told a news conference seven plotters were still atlarge, including an army captain and two sergeants.   He said those arrested included Gabriel Kpolleh, leader of thebanned Liberia Unification Party, party lawyer Cephar Mbandi andfour soldiers, .   The minister said the plot was uncovered on March 16. He said itwas a conspiracy ``to destabilize the government, create internalstrife and overthrow the government by assassinating the presidentof Liberia.''   Bowier said arms, ammunition and military uniforms were found ina building in the Sinkor district of Monrovia.   Investigations continued but the situation was under control, hesaid.   Bowier read from a prepared statement and declined to answerquestions. Journalists were warned not to run editorial comments orcartoons on the plot before the defendants go on trial. Theminister gave no court date.   The Unification party on Monday released a statement expressingconcern over the arrests of Kpolleh and Mbandi. It said severalproperties owned by Kpolleh and his family were destroyed duringinvestigations by security forces and that his wife narrowlyescaped being raped. It did not elaborate.   Bowier advised reporters not to believe any press releasesissued by the Unification party, saying it was banned and itsstatements had no credibility.   Doe, who came to power in a bloody April 1980 coup, has been thetarget of several assassination attempts. An attempted coup on Nov.12, 1985, resulted in more than 600 deaths and the destruction ofthe village of the ringleader, former Brig. Gen Thomas Quiwonkpa,who was killed in the attempt.   Quiwonkpa, who had been living in exile, led the attemptfollowing elections that opposition leaders and independentobservers said were rigged.   Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, was founded in 1847 by freedAmerican slaves. Descendents of the slaves, who were a minority,controlled the government until Doe, from the Krahn ethnic group,stormed the presidential mansion in April 1980, killingthen-President William Tolbert.   The economy declined under the rule of the former army mastersergeant. Major Western creditors suspended aid to Liberia pendingpayment of debts. Last year the United States sent 17 financialexperts to Monrovia to oversee operations of the Finance Ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
