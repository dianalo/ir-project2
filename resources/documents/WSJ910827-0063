With Labor Day approaching, 71% of 5,700 employees,representing a wide range of jobs and industries, say theyare satisfied with their jobs, according to a survey by theWyatt Co. Benefits were rated favorably by 60%, pay by 53%and training by 40%. Some 56% of unionized workers and 48% ofnonunion employees are satisfied with their pay.</LP><TEXT>   But only 30%-32% of union workers, compared with 45%-48%of unorganized ones, said management cares about workerwell-being, treats them with respect or applies personnelpolicies fairly. And only 22%-38% of union workers, comparedwith 34%-57% of nonunion workers, felt managers make gooddecisions, can be believed or operate ethically.   Worker confidence in management fell sharply in recentyears, the survey shows.                                                                                                          HEALTH WORKER PINCH remains tight, despite the recession.   Hospitals and medical laboratories report a growing needfor occupational therapists, X-ray technicians, cytologists(who do Pap smears and other cell analyses) and phlebotomists(who draw blood, especially critical in the AIDS crisis).Pittsburgh Nursing Specialists needs 100 nurses. Greaterdemand and lack of awareness that jobs exist worsen theshortage, says the Summit on Manpower, composed of 18health-care groups.   It says over 45,000 yearly training-program enrollmentswould fill a radiology-technician gap. Last year'senrollments were only 18,693. Up to 21% of hospitaltechnician jobs are vacant. Eileen Connally of the NationalUnion of Hospital and Health Care Workers, sees &quot;no singlecategory of health-care workers for whom demand has evenleveled&quot; in the economic slump.                                                                                                          MEDICAL GROUPS use pay boosts, other means to find moreworkers.   The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texasgives employees a $500 bonus if they refer applicants whotake hard-to-fill jobs. The Texas Heart Institute in Houstonrecruits nurses partly by showcasing promotion prospects andtouting its heart surgery pioneer, Dr. Denton Cooley.Med-Chek Laboratories in Pittsburgh increases technician pay10%.   The University of Pittsburgh medical center starts an&quot;adopt-a-high-school&quot; program to encourage students to seekhealth-care jobs, and it plans a similar grade-schoolprogram. It also reimburses employees' tuition fees forskills-building study.   Pay rises may have worsened the nurse shortage inMassachusetts by enabling nurses to work fewer hours, theAmerican Hospital Association says.                                                                                                          TEAMSTERS UNION vice president and Midwest chief, DanielLigurotis, told police he shot and killed his son in anargument at the Local 705 office in Chicago, where DanielLigurotis Jr. was an official. No charges have been filed sofar against Mr. Ligurotis, a candidate for Teamsters nationalsecretary-treasurer.                                                                                                          RE-EVALUATING GICS: In a poll by the InternationalFoundation of Employee Benefit Plans, half of 71 corporatebenefit executives whose organizations offer guaranteedinvestment contracts said they have taken a special look atthe pension savings instruments since May. After the failureof a few insurers that sold the contracts, 23% of respondentsare changing GIC policies.                                                                                                          RECESSIONS ARE GOOD for hospitality firms; they ease laborshortages and spur new ventures by laid-off managers flushwith severance payments, says Francis Domoy, of RochesterInstitute of Technology's School of Food, Hotel and TravelManagement. Jobless people also have more leisure time, headds.                                                                                                          IT'S EVEN WORSE: Over 70% of 155 large law firms surveyedby Hildebrandt Inc., Somerville, N.J., have unfundedretirement plans, up from 50% in 1989. The consultant saysthis could cripple firms when current 30-to-45-year-oldsretire because young lawyers will balk at financing retireebenefits. The only alternative is to reduce pensions.                                                                                                          WHITE COLLAR PAY: Raises will narrow slightly in 1992.   That's what two more surveys report. Among more than 3,000employers polled by consultant William M. Mercer, salarieswill rise an average 5.2% next year, after a 5.5% gain in1990 and a 5.3% rise this year. Mercer says some employeesmay see 1992 pay freezes again; 1991 salaries were frozen ordeferred at one in 15 firms.   A poll of more than 1,100 organizations by accountantsCoopers andamp; Lybrand shows an average 1992 merit raise of 5.5%for executives, after a 5.7% rise this year. Twice as manyfirms will trim merit-increase budgets as will raise them.But while salaries of 11% of employees are currently frozen,fewer than 2% expect 1992 freezes.   A consultant Hay Group 1991 survey of 40 large firms showschief-executive bonuses dipping 19% where profits fell anaverage 20%, but rising 19% when earnings gained 20%.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Pope John Paul's new encyclical, CentesimusAnnus, endorsing a market economy, &quot;will do more to help thepoor . . . than any previous encyclical,&quot; say conservativesWilliam Simon and Michael Novak in the National CatholicReporter. . . .
