Haploid cells are more sensitive to /sup 89/Srdisintegration than diploid and tetraploid ones. A radiosensitive mutantXRS2, that is particularly sensitive to the transmutation effect of radionuclides,has proved to be sensitive to /sup 89/Sr transmutation as well. At thesame time, another radiosensitive mutant, rad 54, does not virtuallydiffer from the wild-type strain by its sensitivity to /sup 89/Sr decay.</TEXT></DOC>
