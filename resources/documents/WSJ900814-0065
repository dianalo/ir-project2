The employer-financed funds pay for research, training andworker-disease screening to improve fitness and avoid injury.Construction trades are keen on the idea; they had laggedbehind industrial unions, and most of those have only smallhealth and safety offices. The Laborers Union's two-year-oldfund will double its staff of 15. It &quot;has moved from the 16thcentury to the 23rd,&quot; says Sandra Tillett of the AFL-CIO.</LP><TEXT>   The Sheet Metal Workers have a health and safety instituteand a trust; the institute has done 15,000 asbestos clinicalstudies. The Carpenters and Ironworkers unions recently haveset up funds. Joint Auto Workers funds with auto makers offerhealth and safety training.   Construction has 6% of U.S. jobs, but over 20% of workdeaths; it has the highest injury rate of any industry.                                                                                                          LEAD LOOMS as the newest big work place health hazard.   With potential plans for stripping lead-based paint from43 million housing units, and growing bridge, building andstorage-tank replacement or renovation, workers face majorexposure to toxic lead, unions warn. HUD guidelines, dilutedby the White House budget office, are stalled. OSHA excludedconstruction work from more-stringent 1978 generallead-exposure limits, but it mulls tougher rules.   &quot;We already have a lot of workers exposed to lead, and ifthis work is done poorly, we're going to have a lot more,&quot;says John Moran, of the Laborers' health and safety fund.Plumbers, Painters, Carpenters and Ironworkers unions alsopush for protection from lead.                                                                                                          WORKSITE SCHOOLS: A new way to aid working parents.   Dayton Hudson's Target unit will open a school forkindergarten through second grade next month in Minneapolis.The company spent &quot;several hundred thousand dollars&quot; to fixup a storefront space. The school district supplies teachersand equipment. St. Paul has a 25-pupil kindergarten at FirstBank System, which forgoes $48,000 monthly rent.   Employers cite less absenteeism and stress; schooldistricts save money and space. Dade County (Fla.) schoolspioneered the idea in 1987; they share programs with MiamiInternational Airport, American Bankers Insurance Group and acommunity college. The district, saving $1 million fromemployer-provided buildings, talks to six more employersabout such projects.   A Honeywell Inc. engineer refused a job offer, to stay athis Clearwater, Fla., facility, where his son is startingkindergarten.                                                                                                          A DIFFERENT TACK: A federal appeals court in Detroit rulesthat a GM policy barring fertile women from jobs that exposethem to lead is discriminatory. A decision by another appealscourt upholding battery maker Johnson Controls' narrowerexclusion of women of child-bearing age will get SupremeCourt review.                                                                                                          WHO WORKS LONGER? Female chief executives toil an average56.2 hours a week, male counterparts 54.9 hours, a survey bythe Executive Committee shows. The San Diego firm polled 515chiefs. In all, 40% of CEOs work 50 to 59 hours a week and32% labor 60 to 69 hours.                                                                                                          THE `COMPENSATION PARTY' seems to be over, says consultantTowers Perrin, reporting 1990 increases of about 7.6% in 13,500 managers' salaries and bonuses, after rises of about 11%in 1989. Gains had widened in recent years. ConsultantKorn/Ferry says the average draw of 689 polled executives was$289,000 in 1989, up from $116,000 in a similar 1979 survey.                                                                                                          WHY WOMEN LEAVE: About two-thirds of employees who resignfrom the federal government are women, says the Merit SystemsProtection Board. Women often depart for reasons unrelated towork, many for family reasons. &quot;More than a few&quot; would havestayed, if they'd had part-time work, the Board says.                                                                                                          SEND MORE IMMIGRANTS. The message is gaining legislativesteam.   A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee would let840,000 immigrants annually into the U.S. for two years, upfrom 540,000 now, then level off at 775,000. Visas forpermanent workers would be boosted to 75,000, or 188,000including families, from a 54,000 total now. Employers wouldpay a fee for use of immigrants; they'd have to attest thatthey tried to recruit U.S. workers, rather than getting afederal certificate for each immigrant.   A narrower bill passed last year by the Senate would allowup to 150,000 employment visas a year, including families,with 30,000 earmarked for professionals and skilled workersand their kin. Bigger quotas are needed to update a 1965 law,says Rep. Bruce Morrison (D., Conn.) chairman of the Houseimmigration subcommittee, the House bill's author. Some jobsare going unfilled for lack of U.S. workers, he says.   The Bush administration opposes the House bill, as openingimmigration too much, but backs the Senate version.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: The AFL-CIO will urge a national health-carepolicy in commercials starting Sept. 24 on such TV shows as&quot;Murphy Brown&quot; and the &quot;Cosby Show.&quot; . . . Fines assessed bythe Labor Department from child-labor-law raids in March andJune have reached $7.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
