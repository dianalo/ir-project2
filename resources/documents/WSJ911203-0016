On Monday, the first day of trading this month, the Nikkeiindex of 225 stocks tumbled 3.1% to 21992.29, down 695.06points, after shedding 93.07 points Friday. Volume wasslightly less than 200 million shares, a dismal figure anddown from 259.9 million shares in the previous session.Decliners outnumbered gainers 894-90, with 118 issuesunchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst section issues, which fell 2.88 points Friday, skidded38.9, or 2.25%, to 1692.40.</LP><TEXT>   The market began a strong turnaround during Tuesdaymorning's trading with the Nikkei index spurting 265.82points to close the session at 22258.11.   Tokyo wasn't alone, as big bourses sputtered world-wide.In London, share prices finished weaker, though at the day'sbest levels. In Frankfurt, stocks fell on bearishness relatedto weakness in Tokyo and other world markets, and to jittersabout Soviet central authority giving way to republicanpower, after the Ukrainian independence vote.   The Tokyo market's plunge was a cruel continuation ofNovember trends, in which the Nikkei showed gains in justthree out of 20 trading days. Overall, the Nikkei fell 9.4%last month, and average daily volume was a mere 241.2 millionshares.   During the late-1980s boom years, the Tokyo exchange oftensaw daily volume of more than 2 billion shares, much of itthrough active trading in once-popular tokkin fund trusts.Analysts estimated the Tokyo market needs a daily tradingvolume of 400 million to 500 million shares for moststockbrokers to profit from trading commissions.   The Tokyo market needs a return to higher trading volumesto stage a lasting recovery in its own right, said ShigeruAkiba, head of yen equity trading at UBS Phillips andamp; DrewInternational. Otherwise, he said, stocks will continue tosuccumb to selling pressure from arbitrage players, who movequickly between the stock and stock-index futures markets toprofit on price discrepancies between the two.   &quot;Without a recovery to 400 million&quot; shares a day, &quot;there'sno power to absorb all that selling,&quot; Mr. Akiba said. &quot;It'sbecome a structural problem. If the situation continues,there's no chance to see a recovery in the Nikkei.&quot;   The effect of Tokyo's low level of trading is mostseverely felt by midsized Japanese brokerage houses. Theyhave high-cost sales networks catering to individualinvestors, and expensive computer systems, but insufficientcapital to carry their business by trading strictly for theirown accounts. Foreign securities firms, most of which confinetheir business to institutional clients, are less affected.   Japanese brokerage firms &quot;estimate their income based onannual volume,&quot; and with lower volume, &quot;there will be a lossof commission income,&quot; said Brian Tobin, deputy generalmanager of equity sales at S.G. Warburg (Japan).   The low volume also means Japanese small investors havetrouble moving out of some stocks; larger investors can moreeasily abide holding stocks for the long term.   The Tokyo stock market has been falling in reaction topoor earnings reports from many large Japanese corporations,a move out of stocks by Japanese institutional investors, andconcerns about the health of the U.S. economy.   A long-anticipated cut in Japan's official discount rateof one-half percentage point to 5% in early November didn'tstir investors. On Monday, Bank of Japan Governor YasushiMieno said he wasn't yet thinking of another discount ratecut, an announcement some traders said contributed to marketbearishness.   A Bank of Japan quarterly survey on the economy, to bereleased next week, is expected to confirm current pessimismabout the outlook for Japanese business.   The Nikkei index's finish below 22000 on Monday left sometraders expecting additional losses, for psychological andtechnical trading reasons. &quot;This could lead to a drop down tobetween 20000 and 21000,&quot; said Ross Rowbury, a trader withSanyo Securities Co.   &quot;When things get this bad, people just get negative,&quot; hesaid, adding that &quot;there's a general feeling that we have tosell everything quickly.&quot;   The Tokyo stock market has been dominated by a bearishmarket for Nikkei stock-index futures. Japanese institutionalinvestors prefer the futures market for its lower commissioncosts, and because it allows them to trade on their bearishmarket sentiments without offending specific companies withwhich they might have business ties by selling their shares.   Traders said what little sales volume there was on thestock market itself Monday came from arbitrage players. &quot;Thismarket totally depends on how the futures market moves,&quot; saidMr. Akiba of UBS Phillips andamp; Drew.   A major rebound in trading volume will only come, traderssaid, when Japanese institutional investors decide to load upagain on stocks, either because of another cut in thediscount rate or an improvement in the outlook for corporateprofitability.   Tokyo's plunge Monday also pulled stock prices down inHong Kong, Australia, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Taipei. TheNikkei's finish was the lowest level since Aug. 28, when itclosed at 21621.63; the low for this year was 21456.76 onAug. 19.   In London, a host of bearish factors drove the marketlower. Stocks were under pressure from Tokyo's steep loss,early weakness on Wall Street, bearish weekend news reportson Britain's economy, and a new opinion poll that showed theopposition Labor Party with a two-point lead over the rulingConservatives. But prices bounced up from the day's worstlevels on bottom-fishing and bargain-hunting. The FinancialTimes-Stock Exchange 100-share index lost 5.3 points to2414.9, also the intraday high, after marking a session lowof 2387.7, off 32.5. The FT 30-stock index fell 8.6 points to1831.5. Volume was 400.6 million shares, compared with 517million shares on Friday.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index slumped 21.13 points,or 1.3%, to 1545.44. The market's weakness was attributed toTokyo's plunge, fear of an imminent collapse in New Yorkstock prices, and worries about Soviet credit-worthiness.Most German blue chips shed more than 1% and some lost asmuch as 3%.   In Paris, a weak start on Wall Street compounded theFrench bourse's earlier losses, which came on Tokyo's slumpand on French domestic bonds' floundering, and left shareprices sharply lower. Among Pacific and Asian markets, onlyManila gained. Sydney shares lost 0.9%, continuing athree-week downward trend exacerbated by Wall Street's slideand by mixed Australian domestic trade and building data thatcaused uncertainty about economic recovery. Hong Kong stocks'sharp drop came as local and overseas investors, alreadyworried about increasingly tense Sino-U.S. trade relations,sold heavily.   Among corporate developments, in London, fears of a forcedbreakup of the late Robert Maxwell's communications empiregathered steam as trading in shares of Maxwell Communicationand its sister company Mirror Group Newspapers was suspended,respectively, at 35 pence (61.9 cents) and 125 pence.   In Paris, Elf Aquitaine declined 1.6 French francs to381.90 francs ($68.88). The government will offer for sale tothe public 2.3% of the state-controlled oil company on Dec.11-13 and the price will be announced Dec. 10. The 5,780,000shares will be split into three parts, with 1 million offeredin the U.S., 1.4 million in other international markets, andmore than 3.3 million on the Paris bourse; 210,000 sharescould be withdrawn from the foreign offerings to augment theFrench part to satisfy any strong demand there.   In Amsterdam, Ahold fell 1.60 guilders, or 2%, to 78.70guilders ($42.98). The grocer posted a third-quarter profitrise of 11% to 62.9 million guilders ($34.3 million), despitea sharp increase in its interest payments stemming fromrecent acquisitions, but the results were below marketexpectations.   Fokker finished at 26.80, up 0.40, or 1.5%. The aerospacegroup said it expects to receive &quot;several new orders&quot; for itsF50 turboprop plane before year end, but didn't elaboratebeyond predicting the orders would boost the company's marketshare in the 50-seat plane market.   In Milan, where the market's mood was blackened bysuspension of the November trading account and the failedaccord between Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy and Continental ofGermany, Pirelli shares plunged 401 lire, or 23%, to 1,309lire. Pirelli, a tire and cable maker, said over the weekendthat it had broken off 14 months of merger talks with theGerman tire concern and that it expects to post aconsolidated loss of 670 billion lire ($547.7 million) for1991. Pirelli andamp; C., the holding company that indirectlycontrols the Pirelli S.p.A., plummeted 1,270 lire, or 22%, to4,450 lire. In Frankfurt, Continental shares dropped 7.6marks, or 3.7%, to 198 marks ($121.85).
