BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Stockholders have rejected investor HaroldSimmons' plan to win control of Lockheed Corp.'s board, but theDallas billionaire says he was pleased with victories onshareholders' rights issues.   ``It appears we achieved a clean sweep on the issues ofconfidential voting, opting out of the Delaware anti-takeover law,abolition of the poison pill and anti-greenmail,'' said Simmons,who controls about 19 percent of Lockheed stock.   ``The shareholders have spoken clearly on these issues and wewill expect Lockheed's board of directors to take prompt action toimplement the shareholders' wishes,'' he said.   Simmons, who owns 18.9 percent of Lockheed's common stock, hadsought to replace company directors with his own nominees after hisrequest for representation had been turned down.   Citing preliminary tallies, Simmons said the four shareholders'rights proposals each received 57 percent to 97 percent of thevotes cast at last month's annual shareholders meeting. IncumbentLockheed directors were re-elected with between 58 percent and 61percent of the votes each, he said.   Lockheed, maker of the stealth fighter and other militaryhardware, said its directors won with 62 percent of the overallvote and 78 percent of the vote of shareholders not controlled bySimmons. The company also confirmed the outcome of theshareholders' rights provisions, but did not reveal specifics.   The election was conducted at the company's March 29 annualmeeting in Burbank, Calif. The results announced Tuesday arepreliminary and final figures won't be available until Monday.   Of the four proposals, only the one requiring the company to optout of Delaware's strict takeover statute is binding.   The three others are all advisory, although Lockheed ChairmanDaniel Tellep said during the annual meeting that he would work toimplement the confidentiality proposals if supported by a``significant'' minority of voters.   Despite the binding nature of the proposal, Tellep said Tuesdaythe board would have to review the ``poison pill'' provisions. Hesaid he is concerned abandoning the pill would leave the companyvulnerable to hostile takeovers.   Lockheed's ``poison pill'' kicks in once an investor acquires 20percent of the company's stock. It allows other shareholders topurchase additional stock at lower prices, diluting the largeinvestor's holdings.   Under the takeover law in Delaware, where Lockheed isincorporated, companies can chose to adopt other provisions thatmake hostile takeovers more difficult and expensive, includinglimits on sales and mergers involving the company.   The anti-greenmail proposal would prohibit Lockheed from buyingback its own stock at a premium from selected investors. Instead,all shareholders must be able to cash in on the higher prices.   Simmons had undertaken the proxy fight after accumulating theLockheed shares, and watching his $530 million investment drop $100million in value.   Tellep and the company fought Simmons, claiming he had noexperience running a defense or aerospace company.   Simmons insisted the company could be managed better and urgedLockheed to improve profits at non-core business or sell them.   Simmons, who won some large institutional investors to his side,attributed the loss in the directors' races to Lockheed's employeestock ownership plan. The ESOP holds 19 percent of the company'sstock, 90 percent of which was cast for company nominees, he said.   The ESOP was created last year after Simmons began buyingLockheed stock through his Houston-based NL Industries Inc.   ``We feel we did very well for our first try,'' Simmons said.``Last year, for example, confidential voting received 35 percentof the votes and this year it received about 60 percent support.Last year, 27 percent of the votes were cast in favor of opting outof the Delaware anti-takeover statute. This year the proposalgarnered over 60 percent.''</TEXT></DOC>
