<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0805 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention relates to a process for manufacturing an inner tube elementmade of synthetic resin for a double tube coring apparatus provided fordeep drilling. The said element comprises a double tube made of syntheticresin reinforced with fibers and provided at its ends with connectingnipples, is entirely made of synthetic resin and overlaps, at each ofits ends, a part of the nipples having a rough surface gripped by saidfibers, preferably in the form of webs of glass fibers. The inner tubeelement is manufactured by a process in which two nipples or couplingsare placed onto a cylindrical mandrel having a constant section and rotatingabout its longitudinal axis, at a predetermined distance correspondingto the tube element to be manufactured, a part of said nipples havingan inner diameter substantially identical to the diameter of the mandreland having a rough surface, and fibers coated with a synthetic resinare wound helically onto said cylindrical mandrel, so as to overlap therough part of said nipples. 6 drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
