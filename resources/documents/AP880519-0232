Crocker made the remarks in the Portuguese capital a day aftermeeting with Anatoly Adamishin, Soviet deputy foreign minister, todiscuss progress towards a comprehensive peace agreement amongAngola, Cuba and South Africa.   ``The United States and the Soviet Union are trying reach anagreement that will provide a political framework for the countriesin conflict to resolve their own problems, '' Adamishin told aseparate news conference.   Their talks were aimed at supporting efforts by the countriesinvolved to end Angola's 13-year civil war and bring independenceto the neighboring South African-ruled territory of South-WestAfrica, also known as Namibia.   Crocker spoke on Thursday with Jose Manuel Durao Barroso,Portuguese deputy foreign minister. Angola is a former Portuguesecolony.   Angola's war pits the Soviet- and Cuban-backed Angolangovernment against the UNITA rebel movement supported by the UnitedStates and South Africa.   South Africa, backed by the United States, is calling for anestimated 40,000 Cuban soldiers to withdraw from Angola before itagrees to implement a United Nations Security Council resolutiongranting independence to Namibia.   A South African newspaper said Thursday that Cuban troops inAngola are less than 50 miles from the border with Namibia.Business Day cited South African intelligence sources it did notidentify.   Angola says 9,000 South African soldiers, using warplanes,long-range artillery and armored cars have been operating up to 185miles inside Angola since last year.   Both Crocker and Adamishin said their governments rejected theidea of partitioning Angola into two territories, dominatedrespectively by the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation ofAngola government in Luanda and UNITA, or the National Union forthe Total Independence of Angola.
