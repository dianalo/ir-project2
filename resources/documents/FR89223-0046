This decision was basedon a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which analyzed variousconstruction techniques for saving energy and mitigating decreased indoorair quality (IAQ). BPA has determined that four different constructiontechniques or ``pathways'' are acceptable methods of building homes underits program to provide adequate ventilation and substantial energy savings.In reaching its decision, BPA analyzed a total of 11 different pathwayscomparing each of them to a Baseline (1983 building practice). BPA hasdecided to offer Pathways 3, 5, 8, and 10, or an equivalent technology,from among those contained in the Preferred Action Alternative in the FinalEIS. The selection of these four different construction pathways was basedon consideration of five major decision factors: environmental, economic,technical, public concerns, and legal. The factors were carefully balancedfor each a decision that provides the best alternative for BPA's programs.The advantages of the chosen pathways include, health effects that wereclose enough to those in the Baseline to be within its range of uncertainty,substantial energy savings, and maximum program flexibility at reasonablecost.The decision reflects a modified Preferred Action Alternative from thatin the EIS. Pathway 6 has been dropped from consideration, at this time,due to the economics associated with implementation.The Environmentally Preferred Alternative, Pathway 8, results in the greatestoverall decrease in the lifetime cancer rate relative to the Baseline,and provides reasonable energy savings.A mitigation package forms an integral part of the new energy-efficienthomes programs. The four pathways selected have the following environmentalmitigation requirements: exhaust fans for kitchens and bathrooms; designatedair supplies for combustion appliances; information on indoor air quality;Housing and Urban Development (HUD) product standards for formaldehydeemissions from structural board materials; and the offer of radon monitoringand radon source control, known as the radon package.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For information and for additionalcopies of the Record of Decision or the Final Environmental Impact Statement,contact Anthony Morrell, Assistant to the Administrator for Environment_AJ,Bonneville Power Administration, P.O.

Introduction and Background</ITAG>The BPA pursuant to sections 6(a)(1)(A)-(D) of the Pacific Northwest ElectricPower Planning and Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 839d(a)(1)(A)-(D), promotesthe Construction of energy-efficient homes. The new energy-efficient homesprograms include such features as marketing and incentive homes, financialassistance to jurisdictions that incorporate Model Conservation Standards(MCS) into building codes, and implementation of a surcharge policy. TheMCS are energy-efficient performance standards, which were developed bythe Northwest Power Planning Council, for electrically heated buildings.The primary environmental issue for new energy-efficient homes is whethertighter construction increases indoor air pollution, which may in turnadversely affect the health of the occupants. To date, BPA has preventedor reduced this possible effect in energy-efficient homes built under itsprograms by either (1) using mechanical ventilation (MV) systems to maintainventilation rates at levels generally found in homes built when the MCSwere first adopted (1983 building practice), or (2) requiring monitoringand mitigation of formaldehyde and radon levels above 0.1 parts per million(ppm) or 5 picoCuries per liter (pCi/1), respectively.BPA published its Final New Energy-Efficient Homes Programs EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) (DOE/EIS-0127F) in August 1988. The Final EIS tookinto consideration the comments received on the Draft EIS which was publishedin March 1987. BPA prepared this EIS to explore whether other approacheswould control indoor air quality (IAQ) and still maintain cost-effectiveenergy savings. Its purpose was to provide builders and consumers withmore flexibility in how they control IAQ in energy-efficient homes. Differentbuilding techniques and mitigation measures were analyzed for their abilityto maintain IAQ comparable to that found in 1983 building practices, orto even improve it.The Final EIS was distributed to the public in early September and it wasfiled with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on September 30, 1988.EPA's notice of availability of the EIS was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 39516), Friday October 7, 1988. Subsequentto these actions, BPA has decided on the approach to take for its new energy-efficienthomes programs and is issuing this Record of Decision to inform the publicof that decision.In BPA's effort to try to increase builder and consumer flexibility inits new energy-efficient homes programs, 4 program alternatives developedfrom 11 different construction ``pathways'' were examined in the finalEIS. The pathways combined practical, commercially available methods forcontrolling IAQ with common construction techniques. The pathways and thebasis upon which they were developed are illustrated in the figure below.<G/><ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Decision</ITAG>BPA has decided to select Pathways 3, 5, 8, and 10 from the proposed action,or an equivalent to these pathways, to implement its new energy-efficienthomes programs. These pathways are identified in the Preferred Action Alternativedescribed in the Final EIS. Pathway 6, which is also part of the PreferredAction Alternative in the Final EIS has been dropped from consideration,at this time, due to the economics associated with implementation.This selection recognizes the need not only to maintain IAQ, but also toenhance it to ensure that new energy-efficient homes have fewer healthrisks than those potentially occurring in current building practice homes.To accomplish this at an acceptable cost without sacrificing flexibility,BPA is using a strategy that includes indoor air quality enhancement featuresin all of the pathways, a menu of technical ventilation options, and informationto program participants regarding pollutants which they can recognize andcontrol themselves if they choose. Subsequently, this reduces BPA's intrusioninto decisions normally left to individuals. A mitigation package formsan integral part of the new energy-efficient homes programs. All practicablemeans to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the selected alternativehave been adopted.The selection of the modified Preferred Action Alternative used five keydecision factors: environmental, economic, technical, public concern, andlegal impacts. In reaching a decision, the thrust was to develop an appropriaterisk management strategy. In balancing the factors, the uncertain incrementalrisk of ill health from lower air infiltration resulting from new homeenergy-saving construction techniques was compared to a baseline of 1983standard building practices. Another consideration was the uncertain incrementalbenefit of indoor air quality enhancement measures and mechanical ventilationoptions. Lastly, the costs of reducing the health risk while obtainingmost of the energy-efficient new home construction was reviewed. The selectionof the modified Preferred Action Alternative was considered the best alternativefor meeting these factors with the fewest health impacts, least costs,greatest energy savings, and greatest builder flexibility.The Administrator is reserving his right, at this time, to add the remainingseven pathways to the options available in BPA's programs.The Environmentally Preferred Action Alternative is to proceed only withPathway 8. It results in the greatest relative decrease in health effectswith satisfactory energy savings. This alternative is included in the pathwaysselected in the decision. By itself, it does not permit enough flexibilityfor implementing BPA's new energy-efficient residential construction programs,and results in a higher overall regional cost when compared to the Baseline.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Alternatives</ITAG>Four alternatives were considered for use in BPA's new energy-efficienthomes programs. These alternatives were based on the 11 pathways. The fouralternatives were analyzed and compared to a Baseline in reaching the decision.The Baseline was derived from BPA's 1986 medium housing forecast, and assumedno energy-efficient new homes programs were underway. In the Baseline itwas estimated that, from 1986 through 2006, the region would experience335 radon-induced lifetime cancers per 100,000 persons and 10 formaldehyde-inducedlifetime cancers per 100,000 persons.A description of each of the four alternatives follows:(1) <T3>The No Additional Action Alternative: </T3>The No Additional ActionAlternative represents the programs BPA has been pursuing since 1985 topromote new energy-efficient home construction. The analysis is based oncontinuing a regional marketing-based program from 1985 through 2006, butproviding financial incentives only through 1988.It is estimated that by the year 2006 about 1.3 million people will beresiding in 436,600 new single-family, electrically heated homes, of which270,800 will be energy-efficient homes; some 568,800 living in 354,000multifamily homes, of which 228,160 are energy-efficient; and 570,400 livingin 247,300 manufactured homes, of which 59,700 are energy-efficient.The health effects of this alternative as compared to the Baseline arezero because the ventilation rates are assumed to be identical. The energysavings range from 155 to 171 average megawatts at a regional cost of $233million. (2) <T3>The Proposed Action Alternative: </T3>The Proposed Action Alternativeis identical to the No Additional Alternative with regard to programs,number of participants, and number of current practice and energy-efficienthomes built. However, unlike the other alternatives, this one includesthe broader menu of 11 building pathways, including mitigation measures,from which builders and consumers may choose to maintain IAQ. The health effects of this alternative as compared to the Baseline, varyfrom ^58 to +266 for single-family and ^98 to +293 for multifamily radon-inducedlifetime cancers per 100,000 persons, and from ^1 to +5 for single-familyand from ^3 to +15 for formaldehyde-induced lifetime cancers per 100,000persons. Energy savings in average megawatts vary from 54 to 135 for single-familyand from 10 to 37 in multifamily homes. Costs range from 256 to 576 (1986million $) for single-family homes. (3) <T3>The Preferred Action Alternative: </T3>The Preferred Action Alternativeconsists of a combination of 5 of the 11 construction pathways. The Administratoris currently making a decision to implement four of the pathways: 3, 5,8, and 10. Pathway 6 was dropped from consideration, at this time, dueto the economics associated with implementation. These pathways were chosenbecause the health effects were close enough to those in the Baseline tobe within the range of uncertainty and they had substantial energy savingswith maximum flexibility for builders at a reasonable cost. For this alternative, the total number of energy-efficient site-built homesprojected through 2006 is 270,808, with total electric additions projectedat 436,630. The affected population is 1,305,409; some 568,800 living in354,000 multifamily homes, of which 228,160 are energy-efficient; and 570,410living in 247,290 manufactured homes, of which 59,690 are energy-efficient.Radon-induced lifetime cancers per 100,000 persons range from 260 for multifamilyto 419 for manufactured homes, or from 2 to 42 below the Baseline. Formaldehyde-induced lifetime cancers per 100,000 persons range from 10to 12, or up to 2 below the Baseline. Energy savings in average megawattsis projected to be from 158 to 176. The average pathway cost per 1986 dollarsis estimated at 379 million dollars. (4) <T3>The Environmentally Preferred Alternative: </T3>The EnvironmentallyPreferred Alternative results in the greatest overall decrease in the lifetimelcancer rate relative to the Baseline with reasonable energy savings. Pathway2 results in a greater decrease in the lifetime cancer rate, but does nothave adequate energy savings which would increase the adverse environmentalimpact of energy generation. Thus, Pathway 8 was chosen as the EnvironmentallyPreferred Alternative. The total number of energy-efficient site-built homes projected through2006 is 270,808, with total electric additions projected at 436,630. Theaffected population is 1,305,409. The estimated number of lifetime cancers is lower than estimates for theBaseline, with radon ranging from 295 to 328 for single-family, 218 to268 for multifamily, and from 401 to 408 for manufactured homes. Formaldehyderanges from 9 to 12 induced lifetime cancers per 100,000 persons and islower than the Baseline in all homes. This is consistent with the Pathway'shigher ventilation rates. For this alternative, estimated regional energysavings (average megawatts) range from 114 to 130 for single-family, 27to 36 for multifamily, and 40 to 41 for manufactured homes, all in averagemegawatts, depending on whether the upper or lower bound of the ventilationestimate is used. The regional cost would be $619 million. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. The Decision Factors </ITAG>The selection of the modified Preferred Action Alternative was based onthe evaluation of the five major decision factors (environmental, economic,technical, public concerns, and legal) as follows: 1. <T3>Environmental: </T3>With regard to environmental considerations, thePreferred Action Alternative is compared with 1983 building practices (Baseline).It recognizes the increment of risk to human health from lower infiltrationrates of new home energy-saving construction techniques. However, it alsorecognizes the benefits of the mechanical ventilation options and indoorair quality enhancement measures of each pathway. The Preferred ActionAlternative is also sensitive to the protection and enhancement of thequality of the human environment. It takes into account the effectivenessof alternative means for reducing risks of ill-health, and the possibleneed of acquiring electric generating plants, in lieu of conservation,which would consume land and water resources. 2. <T3>Economic: </T3>The Preferred Action Alternative considers the energysavings (the amount of electric power acquired under each alternative).It acknowledges the price of each alternative which includes operationand maintenance cost as well as initial cost to the residents individually,and to the Region, as a whole. Employment, or the ability to provide jobs,is also weighed. The combination of pathways chosen from the PreferredAction Alternative in this decision constitutes a maximization of the benefitsfrom the above considerations in light of the other four major decisionfactors.3. <T3>Technical: </T3>The Preferred Action Alternative provides flexibilityin the variety of choices for building homes. The uncertainty of ventilationrate estimates of 1983 building practices based on new measurement technologies,and the lack of conclusive information on the health effects of the indoorair pollution problem are acknowledged. It recognizes home variability(indoor air pollution varies across dwellings because they differ in constructionpractices, structure, air infiltration rates, volume, pollutant sourcesand emission rates of these sources); and, behavioral variability (differencesin residents' ways of life or habits as they contribute to differencesin indoor air pollution). It is also sensitive to administrative practicalityor the ease and fairness of administering a regional program in cooperationwith Pacific Northwest utilities, States, and other entities.4. <T3>Public Concerns: </T3>The Preferred Action Alternative is sensitiveto the public's concerns regarding consistency in the support of mechanicalventilation. The views of those responding to the Draft EIS were consideredand the changes in the Final EIS reflect their concerns. Allowances weremade for the voluntary nature of participation in programs by residentsand the effect of their actions on indoor air pollution concentrationsin their dwellings. This includes the ability of occupants to reduce indoorair pollution by avoiding known pollutant sources or exercising other optionsbased on information received and the need to allow for consumer choice.It also reflects a minimization of conflict over differences in conservationprograms with Federal, State, and local agencies.5. <T3>Legal: </T3>The Preferred Action Alternative responds to BPA's statutorymission to fulfill obligations under the Pacific Northwest Electric PowerPlanning and Conservation Act including the obligation to give first priorityto energy conservation. It is consistent with the Northwest Conservationand Electric Power Plan prepared by the Northwest Power Planning Council,and it recognizes BPA's limited ability to regulate individual behaviorin private homes.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Mitigation Package</ITAG>A mitigation package forms an integral part of the new energy-efficienthomes programs. The four pathways being selected have the following environmentalmitigation requirements: exhaust fans for kitchen and bathrooms; designatedoutside air supplies for combustion appliances; information on indoor airquality; HUD product standards for formaldehyde emissions from structuralbuilding materials; the offer of radon monitoring and radon source control,known as the radon package.The radon package allows a builder one of two basic approaches. Eitherthe builder constructs the house to include certain foundation treatments(i.e., a ventilated crawlspace or a layer of gravel under the concreteslab), or the builder foregoes those measures and is responsible for requiringradon monitoring in the house after construction. If the monitoring showsthat radon levels exceed 5 picoCuries per liter (pCi/1), then the builderis required to retrofit the house with the appropriate mitigation measureand activate the measure. These actions can reduce radon concentrationsby 70%, on average.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Portland, Oregon, on February 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack Robertson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Deputy Administrator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-4212 Filed 2-22-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
