BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's second-largest city, with itspromised-land image of youth and opportunity, is starting to showits age. The effects of too many years of too much growth areincreasingly evident in Los Angeles' streets and freeways, sewersand landfills.   While in many U.S. cities the challenge is just to replacepublic works as they wear out, Los Angeles faces the addedpressures of California-style growth.   The stress has occasionally popped the city's overworked sewersystem, causing raw sewage discharges into the Pacific Ocean andprompting Mayor Tom Bradley last fall to propose restrictions onthe number of new sewer hookups.   On the region's streets and freeways, daily trips will increase42 percent by the year 2010, according to a local planning agency.Motorists' average speed of 31 mph systemwide today is expected todrop to 11 mph.   And without more landfills, city and county officials say LosAngeles will produce thousands of tons more garbage daily than itcan properly dispose.   ``Our infrastructure has reached the point that it requiresmassive infusions of resources to maintain, or to increase itscapacity to deal with the population growth,'' said Edward J.Avila, president of the city's Board of Public Works.   ``I think Los Angeles has been lulled into a false sense ofsecurity,'' said Delwin A. Biagi, an engineer who joined the city'spublic works department 17 years ago and who now heads the bureauof sanitation.   The city population is expected to swell 16 percent, to 3.6million, by 2010, according to the Southern California Associationof Governments. In the surrounding six-county area, the predictedgrowth is 47 percent, to 18.3 million people in 22 years.   ``Over the next 25 years, we see a 50 percent increase inhousing and jobs in the Los Angeles area,'' said Roger Riga, a SCAGtransportation planner. ``That means it's going to cause some bigproblems with our transportation system. It's already overburdened.We know that. The question is what are we going to do about it?''   Riga's agency, which predicted the growth in traffic, alsoprepared a study in February that sets out three alternatives,ranging in cost from $42 million to $110 million, to alleviatecongestion: by locating jobs nearer to housing through growthmanagement, or changing driving patterns by carpooling orre-scheduling office hours, or constructing new highways and otherfacilities.   However, California Department of Transportation officials saythe problems are so intractable that doubling the number offreeways would not appreciably reduce traffic.   Moreover, a statewide study done by the Governor'sInfrastructure Review Task Force indicates the pricetag would bebillions _ not millions _ of dollars. The task force estimated thestate's public works needs at $78 billion _ and projected a revenueshortfall of $50 billion to meet the demand.   Increasing traffic and other effects of growth have stoked thepolitical fires of Los Angeles' anti-growth movement, said LauraLake, an adjunct faculty member at UCLA's School of Public Health,who heads a group called Not Yet New York.   ``All the people who support slow-growth want to make sure thatthe infrastructure will still be there,'' Ms. Lake said. ``Thesystem is hemorrhaging and they're coming up with very expensiveBand-Aids.''   Her group supported City Council candidate Ruth Galanter lastyear, and the growth-control advocate was elected. Ms. Lake herselfplans to run for a council seat in 1989.   Local concerns reflect a nationwide problem.   Last August, a study of public works funding done for the U.S.Senate concluded: ``As the federal government shifted prioritiesaway from infrastructure financing, new federal laws have mandatedstate and local compliance with new requirements for waterpollution control, clean drinking water and the cleanup ofhazardous wastes.''   Another federal study concluded that as much as $90 billion ayear is needed to pay for all types of public works repairsnationwide.   The problems it identified _ neglected and dilapidated bridges,water systems, highways, mass transit systems and other facilities_ are consistent with what is happening in Los Angeles County,Supervisor Mike Antonovich said recently.   Yet Los Angeles leaders postponed capital improvements to thesewer system for more than a decade while arguing over compliancewith federal clean water standards.   ``The city was running away from its responsibilities,'' saidDorothy Green, president of an environmental group called Heal theBay.   The dispute ended when the city agreed to stop dumping itstreated sewage sludge offshore and to build a secondary wastewatertreatment facility. The primary wastewater plant was built in 1950.   The cost of compliance will be more than $2.3 billion over thenext 10 years, officials said.   Los Angeles also faces a looming crisis over its garbage, whichis thrown away at the rate of 45,000 tons per day in themetropolitan area, said Mike Miller, manager of the city's solidwaste task force.   The city itself, which generates 18,000 tons per day of thattotal, already trucks 5,400 tons per day to outlying countylandfills, Miller said.   ``We have to find additional landfill space and we have to startrecycling efforts,'' Miller said. ``That's all we've got.''   If no landfills are established, the excess garbage will amountto 6,400 tons per day by 1992, and 50,000 tons per day by the year2000, Miller said. By 1997, there will be no landfills remainingwithin the city.   ``We haven't been able to site a new landfill since 1974,''Miller said, listing five ill-fated proposals, includingtrash-to-energy incineration plants.   ``The City Council is very aware of the situation. They justhave no clear-cut plan as to what they're going to do.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, March 28</NOTE></DOC>
