In 1986, Denver-based Apache Petroleum had a loss of $182.8 million after a $153.5 million write-down of oil and gas properties. Revenue was $189.9 million.    Under the original agreements, the oil and gas concern's natural gas was contractually committed to pipeline companies that refused to take or to pay for the gas because it was priced above competitive rates. The company said the settlements release the pipelines from further purchases under the old contracts; they also provide Apache Petroleum with sizable cash payments, improved markets and transportation for its gas, and the opportunity to sell larger volumes at competitive prices.    The company said the actual amount of the write-down will be reported when it releases its annual results Thursday. </TEXT></DOC>
