Enriched elements include osmium, iridium, platinum, chromium,most chalcophiles, rare earths, and uranium. The anomalies are more intense(e.g., Os = 4 ppb, Ir = 0.38 ppb, Pt = 6 ppb, Cr = 12,000 ppm, U = 380ppm) and persist through a thicker interval at the south-central Texaslocality than in Oklahoma, and in both locations the anomalies are associatedwith an increase in phosphate content of the rocks. There is no tangibleevidence of an asteroid or comet impact source for the excess Pt-groupelements and faunal crisis. The cause of the elemental enrichments andthe biological disturbance may possibly be related to a change in theocean chemistry of the Paleozoic seaway, such as increased upwelling,stagnation, or nearby submarine volcanism.</TEXT></DOC>
