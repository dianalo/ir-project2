The system will then generate an automaticreply to every message with the specified subject criteria.andO;Writing and editing messages on-line, while, always tedious, canalso be rather expensive.andP;  Circumvention of the on-line surchargecan be accomplished by creating messages off-line with AT and TMail Access Plus, the company's $100 proprietary communicationsprogram.andP;  AT and T was the first public E-mail carrier to go livewith an X.400 link.andP;  It also supports electronic documentinterchange (EDI).andP;  AT and T Mail's weakest feature is also itsmost important.andP;  The service shows only 40,000 active mailboxes.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   American Telephone and Telegraph Co.

401-7,500 characters, $.80;each additional 7,500 characters, $.80.andM;Requires: Modem-equipped IBM-compatible computer with communicationssoftware.andM;In Short: Special options, like ATandamp;T Talk and on-line folder storage, are theextras that distinguish ATandamp;T from the competition.andP;  Its commitment to X.400link (there is a current link to Dialcom) and high-volume discounts placeATandamp;T Mail in a prime position to serve large companies.andM;ATandamp;T Mail's command structure has much in common with that of competitor MCIMail.andP;  ATandamp;T Mail (available for a $30 annual fee) can Show you the messagesyou have received or sent; MCI lets you Scan you in-box or out-box.andP;  ATandamp;T'sRead, Send, Answer, and Forward commands do as they suggest, just as in MCIMail.andM;ATandamp;T Mail, however, provides some unique options for these basic functions.andO;For example, you can write a standard text reply, keep it on file with ATandamp;T,and have the system generate automatic answers to every piece of mail youreceive that matches a specified Subject criteria.andP;  This is a great featureif you feel that acknowledging every message is important but don't want thetedium of composing each reply.andM;ADDED CHARGESandM;Writing and editing messages on-line with any e-mail service is alwaystedious, but ATandamp;T also makes these activities somewhat expensive.andP;  Inaddition to transmission charges, there is a surcharge for on-line creation.andO;The only way to circumvent it is to create messages off-line with ATandamp;T MailAccess Plus.andP;  ATandamp;T's $100 proprietary communications program.andP;  Even messagesuploaded from your text editor incur a penalty of $.20 or $.45.andM;If you must create messages on-line, you'll appreciate that ATandamp;T augments theusual editing commands.andP;  In addition to the likes of Delete, Copy, andChange, you will find Locate and Undo.andP;  Locate lets you search for a specifictext string; Undo gets you back to where you were a minute ago so that youwon't have to rekey in deleted or altered text.andM;The Directory and Profile commands are particularly useful.andP;  Directory letsyou query the database to find a subscriber's ID.andP;  The Profile command letsyou choose the menuing level (full menus, brief menus, or commands), changedisplay defaults for things such as line length, list logos for paperdeliveries, and automatically forward your mail.andP;  In a reversal of thecurrent attempts to have faxes delivered electronically to your PC, Profilelets you have your e-mail forwarded to your fax machine.andP;  Profile also letsyou change from 1 day up to 6 days the default on-line storage period fore-mail you have read--at no extra change.andM;FORMS/FILES OPTIONSandM;ATandamp;T can extend on-line storage time past 6 days, but only for an additionalfee.andP;  If you opt for Forms/Files status, you'll be able to store messageson-line indefinitely.andP;  A monthly fee of $10 gives you 30 storage units (eachunit consists of a message between 1 and 7,500 characters).andM;Users who subscribe to Forms/Files are allowed to generate simple formson-line and then store them for later use; colons are used to indicate fieldsto be filled in later.andP;  This is a simple and convenient method that can beused for creating standard business forms, including order forms andquestionnaires.andM;Forms/Files users can share folders and create mailing lists.andP;  Mailing listscan contain separate handling instructions for each addressee.andP;  A five-namemailing list could make use of every delivery option:  electronic delivery,U.S.andP;  Mail, courier delivery of hard copy, telex, and fax.andP;  On a par with MCIMail and EasyLink, ATandamp;T Mail offers priority handling that includes receiptsand CODs on e-mail, and overnight or urgent handling for paper mail.andP;  ATandamp;TMail has a unique delivery option that lets subscribers temporarily withoutaccess to a modem retrieve messages via voice mail (ATandamp;T Talk, at $.50 perminute) from any Touch-tone phone.andM;ENHANCED ACCESSandM;ATandamp;T Mail Access Plus delivers all the functionality of the ATandamp;T Mail serviceand more.andP;  The big improvements over an on-line session are obvious: you getfull-screen instead of line editing, commands mapped to function keys, and,as mentioned, no message-creation charge.andP;  A single keystroke gets you backon-line.andM;Access Plus runs in foreground or background mode, or as a TSR.andP;  Version 2.04takes advantage of LIM 4.0 to the extent that the TSR portion of the programand the accompanying Personal Directory can reside in expanded memory andrequire only 25K of conventional RAM.andP;  The Personal Directory is a realbonus, enabling you to paste e-mail IDs, postal addresses, telex, and faxnumbers into your ATandamp;T document.andP;  You can also use the auto-dialer to placevoice calls.andM;With Access Plus, sending binary files is easy.andP;  While you can directlytransmit binary files with the ATandamp;T Mail service alone, Plus can send them inbackground mode, so you don't have to waste time watching control charactersscroll by.andM;SUPPORTING THE STANDARDSandM;The ATandamp;T Mail service also supports EDI (Electronic Document Interchange).andO;EDI is an umbrella term that covers a variety of standards (like X.12) thatenable highly structured information (such as order entry forms) to beprocessed automatically on the receiving end.andM;ATandamp;T has distinguished itself as the first public e-mail carrier to go livewith an X.400 link; currently Dialcom, Telecom Canada, and severalinternational systems are communicating with ATandamp;T Mail using this standard.andO;ATandamp;T's continuing support of X.400 is reflected in its recently announcedATandamp;T Mail Gateway400 service, which promises a transparent link to MHS X.400systems.andM;It is unfortunate that features rank as only the second reason to subscribeto an e-mail service, connections to your business associates being thefirst.andP;  While ATandamp;T Mail offers a host of valuable options, as of 1988 itshowed only 40,000 active mailboxes.andP;  In the long run, unless ATandamp;T Mail candeliver a large enough general subscriber base, it is more useful as anintra-company wide-area e-mail system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
