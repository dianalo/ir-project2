The three officials _ Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, EducationSecretary William J. Bennett and Commerce Secretary C. WilliamVerity _ all agreed that bolstering the basic skills of workers isessentially to maintaining a strong economy.   The Education and Labor departments published the 50-pageguidebook, ``The Bottom Line, Basic Skills in the Workplace.''   It was Verity who provided the most gripping example of problemswhich companies face with illiteracy in the workforce.   ``Basic workplace literacy is an absolute necessity if we are toincrease our productivity, remain competitive in the globalmarketplace and continue to be a world leader,'' Verity said.   He said he had learned of one company that wanted to hire 100people for two shifts at a new, state-of-the-art plant, but hadtrouble finding workers capable of performing fifth-grade math andseventh-grade in English.   Verity, who declined to identify the company, said, ``A test wasgiven to 480 people who applied, and only 49 of them passed.'' Thecompany offered to send those who flunked to an eight-week remedialcourse at a community college, and 50 of the 100 people who tookthe course passed the company's test on a second try.   Verity said the real problem is that schools should be improvedso that all high school graduates ``at least have the equivalent ofa seventh-grade education in English and a fifth-grade education inmath, which is sort of the norm for getting a job in industry.Hopefully, as time goes on, those levels will rise and we'll have amuch better workforce coming out of the school system.''   ``The Bottom Line'' guidebook outlines how to identifyemployees' basic skills and how to improve them. It spells out howto conduct a ``literacy audit'' to determine what skills a workerneeds to carry out a given task, and offers suggestions of actualprograms that have proven successful.   McLaughlin said 75 percent of the U.S. workforce for the year2000 are already out of school. ``Many of these workers areill-prepared to deal with rapidly changing technology because theylack adequate basic skills,'' she said. ``Clearly, business musttake a lead role in remedying the basic skills gap for theseworkers.''   She cited estimates that up to 23 million American adults lackthe basic skills needed to hold a job.   Bennett said, ``Unfortunately, there are still too many peoplewho graduate from our high schools with a diploma, but without thenecessary skills.''   ``Our job doesn't stop with the schools. And that's where thisbook comes in,'' said Bennett.   McLaughlin said it was ``an interesting liaison'' between thethree Cabinet officers. But noting that it was their first jointappearance, she said, ``Maybe we're not quite getting the acttogether.''   Bennett quipped, ``It's our first, but not our last. Peter, Pauland Mary, look out.''
