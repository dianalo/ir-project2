Akin, Staff Veterinarian,Import-Export and Emergency Planning Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, Room 805,Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 301-436-8499.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The regulations in 9 CFR Part 94 (referred to below as the regulations)regulate, among other things, the importation into the United States ofcertain animals, meat, and animal products. These regulations are designed,among other things, to prevent the introduction into the United Statesof rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, hog cholera,swine vesicular disease, and viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease.Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or foot-and-mouthdisease exists in all countries of the world, except those listed in andSection;94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of these diseases. We are proposingto add Papua New Guinea to this list.Rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease have never been reported in PapuaNew Guinea, and there are adequate controls to prevent the introductionand spread of these diseases. We declare a country to be free of rinderpestand foot-and-mouth disease if there has been no case of the disease reportedthere for the previous one-year period. Based on all pertinent informationsubmitted by its animal health authorities, Papua New Guinea qualifiesfor listing in andSection; 94.1(a)(2) of the regulations as a country declaredto be free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease.We are also adding Papua New Guinea to the list in andSection; 94.11(a) ofcountries free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease that are subjectto special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animalproducts into the United States if they: (1) Supplement their nationalmeat supply by importing fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants orswine from countries designated in andSection; 94.1(a) as infected with rinderpestor foot-and-mouth disease; (2) or have a common land border with countriesdesignated as infected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease; (3) orimport ruminants or swine from countries designated as infected with rinderpestor foot-and-mouth disease under conditions less restrictive than wouldbe acceptable for importation into the United States.Papua New Guinea has a common land border with Indonesia, which is designatedin andSection; 94.1(a)(1) as a country in which rinderpest or foot-and-mouthdisease exists. Even though we propose to designate Papua New Guinea asfree of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, the meat and other animalproducts produced in Papua New Guinea may be commingled with meat and otheranimal products from an infected country, resulting in an undue risk ofintroducing rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease into the United States.Therefore, we are proposing that meat of ruminants and swine and otheranimal products, and ship stores, airplane meals, and baggage containingthese meat or animal products, from Papua New Guinea be imported into theUnited States only under the restrictions specified in andSection; 94.11of the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. This change would not result in the importation of significant numbersof ruminants, swine, animal or meat products. We anticipate an increasein the importation of water buffalo since Papua New Guinea would be oneof the few water-buffalo-exporting countries in the world that would berecognized as being free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. At present,we are aware of only one individual in the United States who has indicateda desire to import water buffalo. This individual is now involved in aproject to import these animals from another source, Trinidad. We believeit is unlikely that he would alter his plans in order to import water buffalofrom Papua New Guinea, which is farther from the United States than isTrinidad, because of the increased cost of doing so. Since there are onlyabout 700 water buffalo in Papua New Guinea, the number that could be importedfrom that country would not be great. We do not anticipate that any meator meat products would be imported. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this proposal contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
