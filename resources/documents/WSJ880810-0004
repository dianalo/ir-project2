Prices of some actively traded 30-year government issues fell nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount, after the Fed unexpectedly raised the lending fee it charges banks to 6 1/2% from 6%. Corporate, mortgage-backed and municipal bonds also slipped, while many major foreign bond markets faltered in response to the Fed's action.    Yields on intermediate and long-term Treasurys rose to just under 9.20% from about 9.10% Monday. Coupon-equivalent yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to their highest level since last Oct. 14, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    The Fed &quot;really caught the market by surprise,&quot; said William Wallace, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Despite the rise in (market) rates, I'm not sure anything is undervalued.&quot; E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. who was bullish on bonds less than a week ago, said: &quot;Why buy bonds today if there's a possibility that more rate increases loom? Thank God I'm a trader who can change his mind,&quot; and Salomon's trading positions.    While the Fed steadily has tightened credit since March, &quot;This is the most significant move yet,&quot; said F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The rate on Federal funds, or reserves banks lend one another overnight, could climb above 8% by tomorrow from just under 7 3/4%, he said.    &quot;We might end up with long-term rates above 9 1/2% in the months ahead,&quot; said William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;The Fed is in a tough spot because on one hand the strong economy is forcing it to tighten credit, while on the other the strengthening dollar would suggest scope for lower rates. But the Fed's got to do what's right for the domestic economy,&quot; he added. &quot;That means there's a good chance of tightening moves in Japan and West Germany to keep the dollar stable.&quot;    The rise in the discount rate caused a spurt in the government's borrowing costs as the Treasury auctioned $11.1 billion of three-year notes yesterday at an average yield of 8.77%. That's the highest rate since Aug. 6, 1985, when the average yield on comparable notes was 9.53%. The yield at the previous three-year note auction May 10 was 8.23%.    The Fed's discount rate boost was a message that &quot;we're not going to tolerate inflation, and we'll act to calm it down,&quot; said John P. LaWare, the new appointee to the Fed. He said his future colleagues &quot;figured they had to send a stronger signal than just tightening&quot; credit. Mr. LaWare stressed that his views are those of an outsider not yet on the Fed board.    He told Dow Jones Capital Markets Report that an increase in the discount rate can be &quot;more symbolic than substantive,&quot; because the amount of borrowings by banks from the Fed tend to be minuscule when compared with the level of borrowings done in the money markets.    Mr. LaWare received Senate approval and expects to be sworn in as one of seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board early next week. The 60-year-old chairman of Shawmut National Corp., a Boston-based bank holding company, will be filling the Fed governorship that has been vacant since Henry Wallich resigned for health reasons late in 1986. With the appointment of Mr. LaWare, all seven Fed governors will have been appointed by President Reagan. Federal Reserve governors are appointed for 13-year terms.    In order to keep inflation from growing, the rate of economic growth needs to slow, Mr. LaWare said. &quot;I'm bullish on the economy, but there's more danger of it being too good than of it cooling down too much,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to keep an eye on those things that can cause inflationary pressures,&quot; such as increasing capacity utilization and a tightening labor market.    Gross national product growth &quot;in excess of 3% is probably unsustainable without a pickup in inflation,&quot; he said. GNP grew at a 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter after expanding at a 3.4% pace in the first quarter. While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact level of &quot;full employment,&quot; Mr. LaWare said, &quot;the big burst of employment {recently} indicated we have to keep an eye on developing wage pressures. We're getting to the point where it could be close&quot; to full employment.    Currently, according to Mr. LaWare, inflation is near 4.5%, &quot;about the maximum we ought to feel comfortable with. I would like to see it lower. It should be lower.&quot; -   Treasury Securities   In yesterday's activity, the price of the Treasury's latest 30-year bond fell to 99 9/32 from 100 1/8. The yield increased to 9.195% from 9.11% Monday. The government's 10-year notes fell to 98 25/32 from 99 10/32. The yield rose to 9.19% from 9.11%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 9.46 points to 1217.46. The index ranged between 1214.18 and 1229.26.    Among short-term interest rates, the discount yield on new three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.06% from an auction average of 6.94%. On six-month bills, the discount yield rose to 7.40% from an auction average of 7.26%.    The rate on Fed funds averaged 7.73%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). That would be down from an effective rate of 7.78% Monday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Here are additional details on the Treasury's sale of three-year notes yesterday:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                       3-Year Notes   Applications ................... $32,819,195,000   Accepted bids .................. $11,097,095,000   Accepted at low price ...................... 95%   Accepted noncompetitively ....... $1,186,000,000   Average price (Rate) ............ 99.948 (8.77%)   High price (Rate) ............... 99.974 (8.76%)   Low price (Rate) ................ 99.948 (8.77%)   Interest rate ........................... 8 3/4%   The notes are dated Aug. 15 and mature Aug. 15, 1991.   Mortgage-Backed Issues   Ginnie Maes were down 1/4 to 1/2 point after fairly heavy trading.   Traders said there was unusually heavy selling pressure in the mortgage market. Some investors, apparently fearing that the Fed's discount rate move signals further declines in the bond market, took the opportunity to sell mortgage issues, which have been strong performers in recent months.   August Ginnie Mae 9% securities ended at 93 22/32, down 14/32; 10% securities ended at 99 5/8, down 10/32. The relatively strong performance of the 10% issue reflected two big real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic, offerings totaling $600 million from Residential Resources Inc.   Residential Resources offered two separate $300 million Remics backed by Ginnie Mae 10% bonds, one underwritten by a group led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., and the other led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   The offerings featured floating-rate classes tied to indexes that haven't been used before as the basis for a floating rate in Remic or collateralized mortgage obligations.   One issue had two classes pegged to the one-year Treasury index published weekly by the Federal Reserve, and the other had two that reset off the Fed's index of one-month certificates of deposit. The one-year Treasury index is the basis for a very popular adjustable-rate mortgage.   The Ginnie Mae 10% securities were yielding 10.19% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the when-issued 10-year note narrowed three basis points to 103 basis points. The yield margin now stands at its narrowest point since March 1987.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds showed declines of as much as 1/4 point for actively traded issues. Traders said the Fed's discount rate increase failed to upset some large offerings.   Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs had settled on the preliminary pricing for $500 million of New York City fiscal 1989 Series A general obligation bonds when the Fed raised the discount rate. Even so, the offering was oversubscribed in all but a few serial maturities by yesterday afternoon, Goldman said.   The preliminary pricing of the city's offering left serial bonds yielding between 5.75% in 1989 and about 8.07% in 2010/2018.   Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch, meantime, lowered the yield on California's $3.2 billion of revenue anticipation notes. The notes, due June 30, 1989, initially were priced to yield 6.10%. But after 5 p.m. EDT, the offering was repriced to yield 6%, indicating substantial investor demand, Merrill said.   Among active dollar bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 fell to 91 1/4 from 91 3/8. The yield rose to 7.97% from 7.96%.   Foreign Bonds   The Fed's increase in the discount rate and the prospect that U.S. interest rates will continue to rise in the months ahead helped drive British, Canadian and West German government bond prices lower. Japanese government issues closed with gains before the Fed's action.   The discount rate increase was particularly surprising to traders in West Germany because they said they saw both the Fed and the Bundesbank sell dollars heavily Monday to shore up the mark. The dollar's rally against the mark yesterday more than offset any gains resulting from the central banks' intervention earlier, traders said.   Prices of some government issues fell 0.35 percentage point. The government's 6 1/2% bonds due 1998 fell to 98.20 bid from 98.30 bid Monday. The yield rose to 6.75% from 6.74%.   British government bonds, or gilts, fell as much as 1/4 point, reversing a rally of as much as 1/4 point after the discount rate increase. Although the U.S. move followed only a day after a half-point increase in British short-term rates, analysts said both moves likely were made for domestic reasons and weren't coordinated.   The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007, which had risen to 116 11/32 earlier in the day, fell 1/4 point to 115 27/32 to yield 9.68%.   Canadian government bonds, which fell sharply earlier in the week, declined as much as 3/8 point. The government's notes due in 10 years fell 1/8 point to 96 1/2. The yield rose to 10.06% from 10.04%. The rate on Treasury bills due in one year, meanwhile, surged to 10.20% from 10.13%.   Prices of Japanese government bonds closed slightly higher several hours before the U.S. rate move. Program trading led brokerage firms to cover short positions in the futures market, which pushed cash prices higher. The benchmark 5% No. 105 bonds due 1997 closed up 0.19 point at 99.90 to yield 5.015%, down three basis points from Monday.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices were 1/8 to 3/4 point lower following the Fed move.   The action by the Fed combined with the Treasury's note sale to keep a lid on any new corporate bond issuance.   One privately placed deal was announced. Public Service Co. of Indiana said it placed $50 million of first mortgage bonds due Aug. 1, 1996.   The bonds were priced at par to yield 9.75%. Proceeds will be used to retire the company's $50 million of three-year first mortgage bonds that come due Aug. 15. Those bonds carried a coupon of 12.15% and were also a private placement.   PS Indiana Treasurer Steve Harkness said the utility has gone the private placement route in the past few years because it has allowed the utility faster access to the credit markets than if it sold the bonds publicly.</TEXT></DOC>
