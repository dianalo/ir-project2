Because of this, many institutions would stillcatheterize the majority of patients who have intracardiac left-to-rightshunts. As is demonstrated by this initial experience with the firstdigital subtraction angiographic unit commercially available at out institution,the information that can be gained regarding quantification of shuntsize is similar to nuclear studies and those derived from intracardiacoximetry; however, unlike nuclear studies and to a large extent echocardiographicstudies, digital subtraction angiography provides images of cardiac structuresand anomalies with a much higher spatial resolution comparable to theimages generated from standard catheterization. Although the authors'method of quantifying pulmonary to systemic flow ratios is not completelyautomated as were the nuclear studies, there is a significant correlationbetween the two techniques. Not only does this provide a potentiallyimportant application to the management of patients with left-to-rightshunts, but it helps define the accuracy of digital numbers generatedfrom digital subtraction angiographic fluoroscopy in reflecting physiologicalevents. There has been some debate as to the accuracy of pixel valuesreflecting flow in cardiovascular imaging.</TEXT></DOC>
