The decision was the latest twist in the two-year battle over the$100 million route that has involved United, Continental andAmerican airlines.   ``This is our final decision,'' said Hal Paris, a TransportationDepartment spokesman, adding that the White House already hasapproved the selection of United.   The department, in making its decision, found that theChicago-based United would ``offer more convenient service and wouldcarry more passengers than would Continental or American.''   In addition, the department found that United's extensiveconnecting service from Tokyo to other Far Eastern cities gave it a``substantial edge'' over the other two airlines seeking the route.   ``In large part because of these advantages, United would bebetter able to compete with the other carriers now providing nonstopSeattle-Japan service,'' the department said in a statement releasedwith the 15-page decision.   Both Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines also fly nonstopbetween Seattle and Tokyo.   While airline deregulation gave air carriers the freedom to flywherever they want within the United States, entry into overseasroutes is still subject to government approval and limited bytreaties with the other countries involved.   At various times over the past two years, administrative lawjudges and top department officials have awarded the route toUnited, Continental and American.   Most recently, the Transportation Department said in lateSeptember that it would comply with a U.S. Appeals Court decisionawarding the route to Continental.   But a month later, the department anounced that it wasreconsidering that decision.   Besides United and American, all 10 members of the Washingtonstate congressional delegation had urged the department toreconsider with most of the lawmakers urging that United retain theroute.   United assumed the route in 1986 when it purchased Pan AmericanWorld Airways' Pacific Division, but the department approved thepurchase only on the condition that the Seattle-Tokyo route be dealtwith in a separate proceeding.   United had warned that it might drop its Seattle-Hong Kong routeand lay off many of its 2,000 employees at Seattle-TacomaInternational Airport if it didn't retain the Seattle-Tokyo route. A$20 million expansion of United facilities at Seattle-Tacoma was puton hold pending a decision.   American officials had said their airline was prepared to build anew $100 million to $150 million hub at Seattle-Tacoma if itreceived the route.   American officials also said United wanted to retain the routejust to block other airlines from gaining a foothold in the FarEastern market. United already flies between Los Angeles and Tokyoand San Francisco and Tokyo.   Continental officials had said their airline was prepared toslash fares to the Far East if it received the route, includingone-way Seattle-Tokyo fares as low as $299.</TEXT></DOC>
