Chairman Stephen M. Wolf says heis willing to work without a ``golden parachute'' and a year'ssalary.   In an interview published in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Wolfdefended the estimated $76.7 million he stands to reap from UALstock and options he holds if the proposed takeover of UAL, parentof United Airlines, is completed.   Under the $6.75 billion buyout proposal, United pilots wouldmake pay and benefits concessions worth $250 million a year overseven years in exchange for a 75 percent stake in UAL.   In his first interview since the UAL board of directors approvedthe pilot-management buyout earlier this month, Wolf told theJournal that he plans to forgo his $575,000 annual salary for thefirst year after the takeover.   He also said he was willing to work indefinitely without acontract, which would prevent him from receiving his substantial``golden parachute'' severance pay should he leave UAL.   Wolf said he has asked other senior managers to follow his leadand work without contracts. He also said he plans to donate $1million from his profits to educational charities.   Wolf, 48, is guaranteed to benefit financially from the$300-a-share proposed buyout by senior managers, the pilots unionand British Airways PLC. He said, though, that he would doeverything in his power to make sure the employees make a profit ontheir own investment in the takeover.   While Wolf warned there is no way to guarantee thatrank-and-file employees will benefit from the takeover, he added,``It is my objective to return to employees 100 percent of theirinvestment and a significant profit margin on top of that.''   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissiondisclosed Friday how much Wolf is guaranteed to make once thebuyout is completed, as well as the information that John C. Pope,UAL's chief financial officer, would receive $37.7 million from hisUAL stock and options.   Wolf would get $22.5 million for his 75,000 UAL shares and$54.17 million for his options to buy another 250,000 shares. Popestands to make $3 million on his 10,000 shares and $34.65 millionon his options. The two would continue to run the company under thebuyout plan.   The SEC disclosures came while Wolf and other senior managerswere trying to persuade all UAL employees to make wage concessionsand productivity improvements to help facilitate the takeover.   So far, only the Air Line Pilots Association, a party to thetakeover, has agreed to participate. In addition to the $250million a year in concessions, the pilots have pledged $200 millionfrom pension funds toward the buyout.   The sharpest criticism of Wolf and the other senior executiveshas come from the Machinists union, which is not participating inthe buyout.   A Machinist spokesman said the union finds the Wolf windfall``offensive,'' and also objects to the fact that UAL's outsidedirectors recently voted themselves $20,000-a-year salaries forlife and unlimited free travel privileges on the airline.   The employees would own 75 percent of UAL under the proposal,making it the largest employee-owned company in the nation. Amanagement group headed by Wolf would hold 10 percent, and BritishAirways would hold the remaining 15 percent in exchange for a $750million investment.</TEXT></DOC>
