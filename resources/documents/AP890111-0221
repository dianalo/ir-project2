Another general resignedand said the violence is making soldiers malicious.   Troops shot and wounded nine Arabs on Wednesday in clashes thathave occurred almost daily since the 13-month-old revolt began toprotest Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.   Also, the army said Israeli warplanes bombed a base north of theLebanese port of Sidon belonging to an extremist Palestinianguerrilla faction led by Abu Nidal.   The Fatah Revolutionary Council, led by Abu Nidal, has beenblamed for numerous attacks against Israel and Western Europeancountries. The army said the raid was part of an ongoing attempt topre-empt attacks against Israel.   Meanwhile, debate continues to heat up over the army's role inthe occupied lands. Fifteen Israelis have been killed in theuprising that began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 349 Palestinians havebeen killed, most by army gunfire.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, was quotedWednesday as saying that troops have been unable to halt therebellion and that a political solution was needed.   ``There is no such thing as eradicating the uprising because inessence it expresses the struggle of nationalism,'' the JerusalemPost quoted Shomron as telling a closed session of Parliament'sdefense and foreign affairs committee on Tuesday.   Shomron also said that since November, Fatah and other factionsunder the control of PLO chief Yasser Arafat had halted hostileoperations against Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, thenewspaper reported.   The remarks sparked loud debate among committee members, the Postsaid.   Former army Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan said ``collectivepunishment'' _ punishing a group of Palestinians for an act by anindividual or smaller group _ still was appropriate, the Postreported.   ``Collective punishment merely prompts more civilians to join theranks of the protesters,'' countered Micha Harish of theleft-leaning Labor Party.   Also Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Menachem Einan, who is leaving his jobas the army's logistics chief, was quoted in the daily Maariv assaying he was ``very worried about the level of morality of Israel'ssoldiers in the territories.   ``We are making them face provocations that inspire maliciousnessall too quickly,'' he said.   An army spokesman said Einan had been scheduled to retire Fridayfor a civilian job and that his resignation was unrelated to thecriticism.   The military command refused an Associated Press requestWednesday to interview Einan. It did not immediately respond to hispublished remarks.   In the interview, Einan traced his misgivings about theterritories to the Israeli government's handling of the 1982 Lebanoninvasion, which escalated into a three-year conflict instead of alimited campaign as initially planned.   ``My big lesson is that perhaps there are times when the fightingmilitary echelons cannot accept to the last letter the instructionsgiven by the political echelons,'' he said.   In another development, a senior army officer in the Gaza Stripheld a first-ever meeting with the head of the Moslem extremistgroup Hamas, the daily Haaretz reported.   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin reportedly discussed political and economictopics affecting Gaza with Brig. Gen. Aryeh Shiffman, who headsIsrael's military administration of Gaza, the newspaper said.   Most of the nine Palestinians wounded in Wednesday's clashes werein the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat refugee camp, where troops shot andwounded five Palestinian youths during confrontations withstone-throwers, Arab doctors said.   The army said it was checking the reported casualties.   Israeli newspapers reported that the army indicted threePalestinians on murder charges for allegedly throwing threefirebombs at an Israeli passenger bus Oct. 30 in the West Bank cityof Jericho.   Five Israelis, including a soldier, a woman and her three smallchildren, were killed in the attack. The Palestinians wereidentified as being in their early 20s.   In another development, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir saidWednesday that the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency wasbeing replaced as part of a scheduled rotation, and not because ofmedia criticism of the service.   In an unprecedented decision Tuesday, the Supreme Court overruledthe military censor and gave a Tel Aviv newspaper permission toprint an article that suggests the Mossad chief was responsible forseveral recent failures of the agency.   All articles concerning Israel's security must be submitted tothe censor. The Mossad chief's name and details of his activitiestraditionally are banned from publication.</TEXT></DOC>
