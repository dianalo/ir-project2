Falling oil prices have greatly improved the outlook for lower inflation and interest rates, analysts said. Oil is watched especially closely as a symbol of inflationary pressures, and its recent price declines have easily overshadowed worries about the dollar's prolonged weakness.    Hopes for even lower oil prices this winter have spread because of continued friction within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Earlier this week, OPEC members announced what many oil specialists consider to be a weak price and production agreement for 1988.    The U.S. government's latest 30-year bonds surged yesterday by more than 1 1/2 points, or over $15 for each $1,000 face amount. That followed Monday's advance of about seven-eighths of a point.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. registered its biggest one-day increase since Oct. 26. The Treasury's 30-year bonds were quoted late yesterday at a yield of 9.21%, down from 9 3/8% Monday and nearly 9 1/2% last Friday. Corporate and municipal bond yields also fell, and a large volume of new debt issues was offered to investors.    The bond rally came &quot;largely because of the reduced fear of inflation as embodied in the decline in oil and commodity prices,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, a managing director of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. Lower oil prices provide &quot;a significant offset to any risk of inflation as a result of the weaker dollar&quot; and give the Federal Reserve &quot;more leeway in conducting monetary policy,&quot; he said.    The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee met yesterday and will meet again today to review its credit strategy. Most economists expect the Fed committee to leave policy unchanged. But some also say the committee probably will authorize additional credit-easing moves, to be implemented over the next month or so if commodity prices remain soft and if the economy weakens.    Business leaders say the economy appears healthy but fragile in the wake of the stock market crash, and that business could easily be undermined by any significant increases in borrowing costs.    &quot;If rates go up much more, this country will go into a funk,&quot; warns Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler Corp. He said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &quot;will keep his hand&quot; on rates to prevent any sizable increases.    Despite the latest wave of euphoria to sweep through the bond markets, Mr. Iacocca said he remains uneasy about the financial markets. Frederick W. Zuckerman, Chrysler's treasurer, said he is &quot;especially queasy&quot; about the bond markets because of the dollar's lengthy slump in the foreign-exchange markets.    Chrysler's pension fund, which has more than $3 billion, is keeping an unusually high percentage of its assets in cash, Mr. Zuckerman said. &quot;We have about 36% in cash,&quot; he said, with about 33% in stocks, 25% in bonds and the rest in real estate and other investments.    Some analysts say the economy is heading for a recession and that there is little the government can do to prevent it. But Fred Levin, chief money market economist at Citicorp Investment Bank, disagrees. He predicts continued economic growth next year and higher interest rates.    &quot;We think the economy is holding up fine,&quot; Mr. Levin says. &quot;The jury is still out on consumer spending. But we see rates rising further over the long term.&quot;    The government's latest 30-year bonds rose yesterday to a price of 96 18/32 from 94 29/32. At one stage yesterday, the issue jumped to 96 24/32.    The Treasury's latest 10-year notes rose to 98 26/32 from 97 28/32. The yield fell to 9.05% from 9.20%.    Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds jumped nearly 21 points to 1224.76. The high was 1227.84, while the low was 1210.63. On Oct. 26, the index soared 22.60 points.    In the corporate debt market, the largest new issue was $500 million of notes by General Electric Capital Corp. The &quot;remarketed reset&quot; notes carry a rate of 8 3/4%, priced at par. The notes have a final maturity of Dec. 15, 2007, but the company has the option to redeem the notes in three years at par. If the company doesn't call the notes, holders have the option to put the notes back to the remarketing agent at par. If the notes aren't called, a new rate will be set for a period of either two, three, four or five years.    Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said the notes were priced at 0.60 of a percentage point above the rate on the Treasury's three-year notes. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Several other corporate issues were offered, including:    --A $200 million issue of Chase Manhattan Corp. notes, due Dec. 15, 1990. These 9 1/4% notes, which are noncallable, were priced at par.

Brown andamp; Sons Inc. heads the underwriters.    In the municipal arena, underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. tentatively priced $358.1 million of revenue refunding bonds by the Intermountain Power Agency.
