Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, was instructedto take the matter up immediately with PLO officials. It would behis fourth meeting with Arafat's representatives since the Reaganadministration broke a 13-year ban last December on U.S. talks withthe PLO.   The attempted raid Saturday, in which four Palestinians and oneLebanese were killed, was the first against Israel since Arafat, atU.S. urging, publicly renounced terrorism in all forms. He alsoaccepted Israel's right to exist and U.N. Security Councilresolutions calling for secure borders for all countries in theMiddle East.   Former Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy and othersenior U.S. officials cautioned the PLO at the time that thedialogue would be suspended if Arafat broke his pledge to eschewterrorism in his dispute with Israel.   Moshe Arens, the foreign minister of Israel, said Monday the raidviolated the pledge, while Deputy Israeli ambassador Oded Eran urgedthe State Department to break off the talks with the PLO.   Under a barrage of questions, Redman said Arafat's renunciationof terrorism was supposed to be applied everywhere, not just inIsrael itself. But he declined to say whether the raid by tworadical wings of the PLO violated the PLO chairman's promise.   Identification found on the bodies of the five slain guerrillasindicated they belonged to Dr. George Habash's Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Front headed byMohammed Abbas.   Redman said the incident and any others that might occur would beexamined on a ``case-by-case basis'' to see if they were acts ofterrorism by the PLO. He did not say what Pelletreau would tell thePLO representatives in Tunisia or how long it would take the StateDepartment to complete its investigation.   Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, spokesman fo the PLO, said the guerrillaswere fighting the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon anddefending Palestinian camps.   ``What are the Israelis doing in south Lebanon?'' he told TheAssociated Press in Paris by telephone from PLO headquarters inTunis. ``Is that aggression or not? We have been facing this Israeliaggression since 1982. We have the right to self-defense. We havethe right to defend our people and our camps.''   Asked if he was specifically denying that the five were en routeto Israel, Abdul-Rahman said: ``In fact, I don't know. We are in adefensive attitude against the Israelis in south Lebanon.''</TEXT></DOC>
