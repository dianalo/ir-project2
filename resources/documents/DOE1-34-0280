A series of experimentswere conducted to evaluate the effects of wood species, moisture content,and wood feed rate on gasifier performance. Wood feed rates of up to2000 lb/h were obtained using the system. A 100-h continuous test wasalso conducted to evaluate long-term effects on gasifier operations.</TEXT></DOC>
