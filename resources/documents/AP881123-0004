(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Every day is Thanksgiving Day at theRainbow Kitchen, one of hundreds of American soup kitchens wherehunger never takes a holiday.   ``These people need help year-round, not just during theholidays,'' Kevin Amos said as he stocked the Rainbow Kitchen'spantry with canned goods.   ``This is one of those thousand points of light (President-electGeorge) Bush talks about,'' said Bob Anderson, a former steelworker. ``But there's no reason this kind of charity should have toexist. We just keep going because we don't want to see people turnedaway.''   Anderson opened the Rainbow Kitchen in 1984 after the sharpdecline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless inHomestead, a historic steel town adjacent to Pittsburgh.   The Rainbow Kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines, foodbanks, churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make upan ever-growing, mostly volunteer and imperfect machine thatdistributes millions of pounds of free food every year.   ``We never thought we'd be in operation this long,'' Andersonsaid. ``The number of people we serve just keeps growing andgrowing.''   Homestead's Eighth Avenue bustled when U.S. Steel's sprawlingHomestead Works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early1980s. But the mill is cold and shuttered now, and business on theavenue is slower.   At noon each day, a quiet line forms outside the Rainbow Kitchen,where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people.   ``We get a mixture of people,'' Anderson said. ``It used to be alot more unemployed people. I think now it's more underemployedpeople. I see more children than I'd like to see here. We get wholefamilies.''   One recent chilly afternoon, Sharon Fischer, 25, expressedgratitude as she and two of her three young children munched onhamburger patties, pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates.   ``I'm not ashamed. I'm not rich,'' she said. ``This is decent.They make sure you're full when you leave.''   Ms. Fischer, single and unemployed, said she has looked for work,but ``they aren't hiring.'' She said she can't get by on foodstamps, so she eats at the kitchen several times a week.   Anderson operates the Rainbow Kitchen on $125,000 a year. Most ofthe money comes from small donations, although rock star BruceSpringstein donated $10,000 in 1985.   ``Sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line,''Anderson said. ``We open up some big cans of beans or something andjust start making sandwiches like crazy.''   Every Thursday, the Rainbow Kitchen opens its pantry to about 700families who are given a bag or two of groceries.   Since 1980, changes by Congress and the Reagan administrationhave narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced theamount going out. Last year, the federal government spent $10.59billion for food stamps, compared with $11.98 billion in 1980,according to Census Bureau figures adjusted for inflation. In thattime, the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about900,000, the Census Bureau said.   In roughly the same period, from 1979 to the present, the numberof people living below the poverty line of $11,600 annual income fora family of four has grown by 6 million, the government reports.   Many people eligible for food stamps either don't apply or arewrongly rejected, according to Robert Fersh, executive director ofthe non-profit Food Research and Action Center in Washington, D.C.   On average, food stamp recipients each month get stamps worthabout 54 cents per meal, although Fersh said some elderlyindividuals get as little as $10 a month. It's therefore no surprisemany run out of money at month's end and turn to pantries and soupkitchens for help, he said.   ``The number of people needing food by the end of the month hasrisen,'' Fersh said. ``The people who rely on the safety net notonly have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medicalcare and utilities.''   Annual surveys by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reveal a steadyincrease in the need for emergency food, said Laura Waxman,assistant executive director of the group.   A survey of 26 cities found two-thirds of those who needed foodin 1987 were families with children, she said.   ``You think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the singleman or the single woman, but we know there are more and morefamilies,'' Ms. Waxman said.   The heart of the nation's grassroots food distribution is theSecond Harvest National Food Bank Network, which began in 1979 inPhoenix.   Last year, Second Harvest, now based in Chicago, distributedabout 387 million pounds of food. Its 205 affiliated food banksserved 38,000 local charities, including pantries, soup kitchens,shelters, and day-care and senior citizen centers.   Yet the need for more food is constant.   ``What I generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is sostrapped for food and money that it is only able to supply threedays' supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth ofthe family's need,'' said John Arnold, public policy manager forSecond Harvest.   Many of the nation's food banks started in church basements withone vehicle to haul food, but the average food bank today hasseveral trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food ayear, Arnold said.   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank boasts a160,000-square-foot warehouse in nearby McKeesport that was boughtafter a fund-raising drive led by two local banks. In 1987, the foodbank distributed about 7.3 million pounds of food to about 300affiliates, including the Rainbow Kitchen, said Executive DirectorJoyce Rothermal.   More than half the food bank's supplies are donated by SecondHarvest, grocery stores and individuals. Some are bought with statemoney, a small portion with federal money and the remainder withfood bank money.   ``There's a group of people who are really bad off,'' Ms.Rothermal said. ``It's falling to the private sector to help them.''   Harry and MariAn Halt of Homestead, who have a teen-age son anddaughter, were among those crowded into the Rainbow Kitchen on arecent Thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slabof butter, a carton of eggs and other groceries.   ``We usually make the food stretch, but we sometimes get a littleclose,'' said Halt, 47. He said heart problems forced him in 1986 toquit his job as a caseworker for the state Department of Welfare.   ``I don't know what we'd do without these food banks,'' Halt said.</TEXT></DOC>
