Earlier yesterday, a Delaware Chancery Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing KKR from completing its tender offer for Macmillan until Maxwell Communication Corp. could file its appeal. Macmillan has agreed to be acquired by KKR for $90.05 a share, but Maxwell has bid $90.25 a share for the publishing and information services company.    Maxwell's legal challenge centers on the lockup agreement that Macmillan granted to KKR, as well as the fairness of an auction held for the company Sept. 26. The lockup gives KKR the right to buy four of Macmillan's most valuable businesses for $865 million should the merger agreement between Macmillan and KKR fall through. Maxwell could proceed with its tender offer despite the lockup, but would immediately incur some $250 million, or $8 a share, in taxes. Maxwell has said that it won't proceed with its tender offer if the lockup isn't enjoined.    Oral arguments are set for Nov. 2.    On Monday, Vice Chancellor Jack Jacobs of the Delaware Chancery Court declined to enjoin the lockup, despite his criticism of the way the auction had been conducted. He also decided not to enjoin the estimated $69.3 million in fees and expenses that KKR will collect from Macmillan whether or not its merger is consummated. However, Macmillan's poison-pill plan, which Maxwell also had challenged, was conditionally enjoined by Judge Jacobs. </TEXT></DOC>
