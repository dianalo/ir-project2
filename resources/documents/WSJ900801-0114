However, thesupport for Mr. Vincent's decision to deprive Mr.Steinbrenner of his majority ownership in the team seems tohave little connection to the issue at hand -- the Yankeeowner's dealings with a reputed gambler. Instead, the fansappear to feel that George is being &quot;sentenced&quot; with exilefor the crime of turning the team into a 17-year-long soapopera. If the world of politics was as closed and private asbaseball, Mr. Vincent would now go to Capitol Hill toinvestigate and ban from public life the perpetrators of theSandamp;L mess.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
