The measure, sent to the House on a 62-28 vote Wednesday, alsowould restructure the government-owned industry, which preparesuranium ore for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.   The legislation has prompted concern over the trade agreementbecause it would impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclearutilities that load their reactors with more than 37.5 percentforeign uranium.   Opponents, including Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and DanielEvans, R-Wash., argued that the provision would violate the recentfree trade pact signed with Canada, a leading exporter of uraniumthat is cheaper and of higher grade than the ore produced by U.S.mills.   An attempt by Bradley and Evans to strike the import penaltieslost 47-45.   In arguing for the bill, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.,complained that President Reagan's treaty negotiators let theCanadians say, in effect, that ``We not only want your (uranium)market, we want to wipe you out.''   Reagan has vowed to veto any bill that violates the trade pact.   The legislation would convert the Department of Energy's uraniumenrichment program, a multibillion-dollar loser since themid-1970s, into a corporation owned by the government. If theenterprise begins turning profits, the treasury could sell thestock in a bid to recover previous investments.   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who guided the measure throughhis Energy Committee, said it is ``the culmination of six years oflegislative effort to fashion a sound, sensible, and well-balancedprogram to address the challenges we face today in the uraniumindustry and the nuclear fuel cycle.''   He estimated the bill would restore 20,000 jobs in the uraniummining industry, which has dwindled to just 2,000 workers in thisdecade. And he estimated the uranium enrichment workforce, cut byhalf since 1980, could be restored to at least 12,000 jobs.   The United States was once the world's only supplier of enricheduranium, and the domestic nuclear power industry has grown at a farslower rate than originally projected.   The number of domestic uranium mines dropped from 362 in 1979 to3 in 1986; net earnings for the industry were negative the lastthree years; and imports accounted for an increasing share ofdomestic requirements.   Opponents say a provision settling the industry's debt to thegovernment for enrichment costs in exchange for $364 million infuture payments is a bailout for the industry. Their estimates ofthe real cost range from $3 billion to $8.8 billion.   The 1954 Atomic Energy Act required the government to be fullycompensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercialutilities. The process is performed at three DOE facilities, at OakRidge, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky.; and Portsmouth, Ohio.   Enrichment involves increasing the percentage of fissionablematerial in natural uranium from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent,the amount necessary for use in light-water reactors.   Although the legislation would impose import fees on utilitiesusing more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium, the utilities wouldbe able to buy up to half their uranium from foreign supplierswithout penalty starting in 1995.   Another section of the bill would create a $1 billion fund toclean up or stablize large, mildly radioactive piles of uraniumtailings at 26 sites in Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas,Utah, Washington state and Wyoming. The cost would be sharedequally by uranium mill owners, nuclear utilities and thegovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
