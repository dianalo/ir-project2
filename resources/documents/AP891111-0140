Godoy, candidate of the 14-party United National Opposition,spoke to a cheering crowd of 2,500 in the provincial town 38 milesnortheast of Managua.   ``We don't want weapons, we want food!'' supporters yelled.   Abolition of the draft, in effect for youths 18 to 25 years old,and release of political prisoners, are included in the coalition'sofficial platform.   The leftist Sandinista government has said it will declare anamnesty for political prisoners after Contra rebels demobilizeunder a five-nation peace agreement.

As Godoy entered the town, a small group of youths threw rotteneggs at his caravan. In his speech, he said the group of youngpeople had been corrupted by the Sandinista government.   He called President Daniel Ortega's administration ``agovernment of gangs that has brought the country only destruction,pain, anguish and death.''   About 1,000 people attended rallies for Godoy in each of threeother towns in the province of Boaco before he visited theprovincial capital.
