Tomorrow, the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of theHouse Banking Committee will begin voting on a bill tobolster the deposit-insurance fund, impose stiffer accountingstandards on banks, force regulators to deal more promptlyand aggressively with weak banks, and limit depositinsurancecoverage on big accounts.</LP><TEXT>   Parts of the bill -- the first step this year in an effortto overhaul U.S. banking laws -- have broad support in theHouse and Senate Banking committees. But bankers andregulators are beginning to worry that the bill proposessweeping changes that could accelerate bank closures byreducing regulatory discretion to help troubled banks throughproblem times.   The Fed is particularly concerned about a provision thatwould limit the central bank's ability to extend credit topoorly capitalized banks through its discount window.&quot;Removing from these institutions the liquidity supportprovided by the Federal Reserve would force premature andunnecessary closure, increase the potential costs to thedeposit insurance fund, unnecessarily interfere with ongoingcredit relationships with adverse effects on borrowers, andraise the potential for systemic disruption,&quot; Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan said in a letter to House Banking CommitteeChairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas).   The provision the Fed dislikes would prevent the centralbank from lending to an undercapitalized bank for more thanfive days in any three-month period. The idea is to stop theFed from pumping money into banks just before they fail, asthe Fed did in an unsuccessful effort to save National Bankof Washington.   Mr. Greenspan said the provision &quot;seems based on themistaken premise that every undercapitalized institution isnonviable.&quot; In fact, he wrote Rep. Gonzalez, &quot;Our experienceindicates that many institutions suffering a capital setbackcan be expected to recover.&quot;   Rep. Gonzalez and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairmanof the Financial Institutions Subcommittee, introduced thebill with two purposes: to enable the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. to borrow the money needed to meet the costof the current wave of bank failures that has nearly depletedthe Bank Insurance Fund and to tighten bank regulations sothat fewer banks will fail in the future.   Everybody agrees with the goals of the bill, but manybankers worry about the cost and rigidity of proposalsdesigned to prevent bank failures. The bill urges regulatorsto impose new accounting standards, including market-valueaccounting of assets. Many bankers contend that this changewould lead to volatile swings in asset values. It also wouldimpose new auditing standards, including a requirement toreview the bank's procedures for complying with laws andregulations to insure safe and sound practices. Thisrequirement could lead to increasingly complex and costlyaudits by accountants who want to insulate themselves fromany liability if the bank fails, bankers say.   The bill would also require regulators to move swiftly tocorrect problems at weak banks by halting dividend payments,requiring management changes and forcing the bank to restrictgrowth and raise more capital. It would also requireregulators to set capital high enough to protect the FDICfrom loss if a bank fails. This could force &quot;banks to holdastronomical amounts of capital,&quot; warned Ken Clayton, alobbyist for the American Bankers Association.   In a compromise last week, the Banking Committee agreed topush the Gonzalez-Annunzio bill quickly through thesubcommittee before taking up the administration's proposalfor allowing banks to branch nationwide, affiliate withsecurities and other financial-service companies and be ownedby industrial corporations.   It was only after last week's agreement to move quickly onthe Gonzalez-Annunzio bill that bankers began learning of thebreadth of the proposal. Officials at the Treasury and atbank trade associations worked through the weekend to devisestrategies for trying to win changes in the bill.</TEXT></DOC>
