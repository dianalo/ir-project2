The Labor Department report provided additional data suggestingthe rate of wage gains was picking up and placing inflationarypressures on the economy.   The 3.1 percent annual increase in wages won in contractssettled in the first quarter of 1989 contrasted with a 2.5 percentaverage for the 12 months ended March 31, indicating wage inflationhas accelerated in the past three months.   The first-quarter settlements covered 199,000 workers, about 11percent of the approximately 1.8 million workers whose contractswere settled through collective bargaining in the past year.   Although the report showed signs of recent wage acceleration,the rate of average wage gains during the life of the contracts wasdown for both those contracts settled in the past three months andthose settled in the past year.   The 3.1 percent average annual wage gains negotiated in thefirst quarter compared with a 3.5 percent average annual increasesthe last time parties to those contracts negotiated, the governmentsaid.   For 12-month period, the 2.5 percent average annual wage gainsduring the life of new contracts compared to 2.7 percent in theprior contracts.   Eleven percent of the workers whose contracts were settled inthe past three months have a cost-of-living adjustment included inthe pacts, but those workers generally received lower actual wageincreases to offset expected COLA payments later.   Workers in non-manufacturing jobs fared better than those inmanufacturing in the first quarter, winning average annual raisesof 3.3 percent compared with 2.3 percent in manufacturing.</TEXT></DOC>
