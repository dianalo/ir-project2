Family background, he says, has a major influence on students, asdoes the skill of their teachers.   ``There is no substitute for good teachers,'' he says, but``differences in teacher skill are not strongly related toeducational backgrounds, amount of teaching experience, or teachingin small classes.''   Hanushek says schools should direct their attention to the actualperformance of teachers through such incentives as merit pay.   Hanushek, former deputy director of the Congressional BudgetOffice, analyzed 187 separate studies of students' performance atprimary and secondary schools during the past 20 years.</TEXT></DOC>
