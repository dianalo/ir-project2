It is that ofAtlanta's best-known adopted son, mustering troops for a waragainst the city's rampant poverty.   Jimmy Carter, who has made it his mission in recent yearsto wrestle with problems of war and health around the globe,is now pouring his considerable energies into his ownbackyard. His &quot;Atlanta Project,&quot; first conceived last fall,is an all-out assault on the crushing poverty, shabbyhousing, substandard schools and violence that bedevil thenation's 12th-largest metropolitan area.</LP><TEXT>   Already, the former president has met with more than 1,500civic, religious and business leaders, urging them to bandtogether to cure Atlanta's ills. With a planned budget ofabout $4 million a year, Mr. Carter and his aides plan firstto sit down with residents in 20 of the city's poorestneighborhoods, identify their most pressing needs, thenmarshal the money and people needed to answer those needs.The first of what he hopes will be tens of thousands ofvolunteers are supposed to hit the streets this spring.   &quot;The greatest problem in the nation is that rich, powerfuland secure people like us don't help poor people,&quot; he says.&quot;Somewhere in God's world there needs to be one major urbancommunity that can successfully address these problems.&quot;   Whether that community is Atlanta remains to be seen.While most civic leaders strongly support the project, a feware sniping at the makeup of Mr. Carter's team. Hiswell-heeled advisers, both black and white, and the expectedlegions of volunteers &quot;historically have no understanding atall of people in trouble,&quot; says the Rev. Timothy McDonald,executive director of Concerned Black Clergy of Atlanta. Someurban experts also question whether the Atlanta Project,without significant federal funding and fundamental changesin the distribution of wealth, will make a lasting dent onpoverty.   &quot;It will be painfully apparent that economic problems arenot going to be solved on a local level,&quot; says Donald Rae,professor of urban politics at Yale University.   Still, if nothing else, Mr. Carter's calls for change andsacrifice are whipping up debate over problems that for 20years and more have been festering in Atlanta, a city thatwould much prefer to speak of its baseball team or its newdomed athletic stadium.   Mr. Carter, says Micheal Giles, political scienceprofessor at Emory University, &quot;brings attention that hasn'tbeen there since the riots of the 1960s.&quot;   Indeed, political and business leaders in cities acrossthe country appear more willing to confront the problems thatplague their communities than at any other time in the pasttwo decades. During the 1980s in particular, with many citiesriding the crest of the longest economic expansion in thenation's history, officials calmly assured the disadvantagedthat they, too, would benefit from the boom. Meanwhile,federal dollars were growing increasingly scarce.   &quot;The Reagan Administration put the federal government outof the business of dealing with domestic problems,&quot; saysClarence Stone, professor of political science at theUniversity of Maryland. Now, with a recession firmly inplace, &quot;cities throughout the country face extremely seriousproblems.&quot;   Few more serious than Atlanta. On its face, the city isstill the proud capital of the South. Its population in thepast decade swelled by nearly 600,000. From 1982 to 1987,Atlanta led all major metropolitan areas in job growth rate.In 1990, in what seemed the ultimate prize, the city wasnamed as the host of the 1996 Summer Olympics.   But most of Atlanta's well-publicized growth actuallyoccurred a half-hour bus ride from downtown. One of thearea's biggest industries is now crime: nearly 29,000robberies, murders, rapes and aggravated assaults in 1990.Violent crime among Atlanta juveniles tripled in the pastfive years; drug cases increased 17 times. &quot;It's a communityunder siege,&quot; says Malkia M'buzi Moore, educationalcoordinator at the Nexus Contemporary Art Center. &quot;There's afeeling of violence, that things have gotten out of control.There's a loss of humanity.&quot;   More than one-third of Atlanta's families survive on lessthan $15,000 a year. In the 1980 census, Atlanta rankedsecond to Newark, N.J., in having the nation's highestpoverty rate. When the 1990 census figures come out laterthis year, Mr. Carter says, &quot;It's likely we'll find thatAtlanta is the poorest city in the nation.&quot;   One thing the community won't get much of from Mr. Carteris cash. He has already put civic leaders on notice that hehas no intention of creating another cumbersome bureaucracy.He wants to go after federal dollars not being used and getlocal programs to work more effectively with existing funds.Besides, he says, &quot;There's a feeling it's like pouring moneydown a rat hole: No matter how much money you pour, you'renot going to do anything&quot; about the problems.   In fact, Mr. Carter's major weapons in this battle are hisown good name and moral suasion. That has accounted for quitea bit since the former president left office. From his CarterCenter in Atlanta, a non-profit base for global activism, hehas been a catalyst for conflict resolution. He has workedwith world health groups to boost the immunization ofchildren in the Third World to 80% from 20% and he hasmonitored elections in Zambia, Nicaragua and Haiti.   Already, Mr. Carter has begun twisting arms amongAtlanta's elite. Dan Sweat, who for 15 years spoke for localbusiness interests as head of the influential Central AtlantaProgress, has agreed to head the Atlanta Project. RonaldAllen, chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines, basedin Atlanta, will head a group of executives who are scouringthe city for still more corporate donations.   Mr. Carter is also calling in his political chits. He hastalked to President Bush about the plan. He will work withJack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, tosimplify applications for federal aid.   A six-person secretariat to oversee the Atlanta Project,along with an 18-member advisory board, were selected lastNovember. The secretariat will try to match community needswith existing programs. Any gaps will be filled byvolunteers.   In recent months, Mr. Carter himself has begun what hehopes will be continuing talks with residents of the 20neighborhoods targeted for assistance. Two residents fromeach of those neighborhoods will be paid liaisons to theProject. At the same time, the volunteers that Mr. Carterbelieves are essential to the program's success will start toassemble.   For instance, he wants successful mothers to coachpregnant teens on taking care of babies and even to drivethem to doctor appointments. He is asking churches to adoptpublic housing projects -- to get to know residents, cleanyards, and repair boarded-up units. He is calling oncorporations to donate computers and to lend executives to dopaperwork for overburdened schools. There are few LittleLeague teams at the projects; he wants sponsors to buyuniforms. School health clinics are rarely open; he hopesnurses will volunteer to keep them open.   Even before it officially starts in March, the AtlantaProject is being scrutinized nation-wide. If it works, othercities are sure to hold it up as a model, says Prof. MichaelPreston, chairman of the political science department at theUniversity of Southern California. But if it fails, saysMichael Lomax, chairman of Fulton County's commission, &quot;It'snot only a poor harbinger for Atlanta, it's a tragicharbinger for urban America.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
