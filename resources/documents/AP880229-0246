Mulligan decided he'd better go see theworld's longest river before it's too late. Here's his journal of arecent cruise 1,200 miles up the Amazon on a small passenger ship.</TEXT><BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ABOARD THE MV BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``Aaaah-Yeeee-Haaaaa.'' Tarzan criesupstage the incessant caw of birds, the chatter of monkeys andpeeping of frogs in the vine-tangled rain forest.   In the morning mist on the Amazon River, dozens of dugout canoesdart out from a thatched village hugging the muddy bank, where ascrawny pig and a few frazzled chickens scurry beneath the bananatrees.   The cries of the canoeists, paddling furiously toward us withwhat seemed to be long-handled, gaily painted pingpong paddles,brought out more boats from houses on stilts farther upstream andin the side creeks.   ``They come to greet us but also to keep their boats from beingsmashed against those little wooden docks by our bow wave,'' saysCapt. Harry Biehl, looking down from the bridge wing of the10,000-ton MV Berlin, a small West German passenger ship.   Most of the 270 passengers desert morning bouillon on the Lidodeck to hug the rails with their cameras and shower down chocolatebars, fruit from the dining room, soap from their cabins,cigarettes and ball point pens in plastic bags on the Indianfamilies, from toothless grandmothers down to the tiniest infants,bobbing about in the mini-armada that soon slid by in our churningwake.   Around the next bend, where a generator throbs and a TV antennarises improbably above the flame and rubber trees, the excitedyells of a small boy out on the landing empties out the clapboardCasa de Sao Jeronimo mission, leaving the preacher waiting at thealtar on a steamy Sunday morning, as his parishoners took to theirboats.   What next?   First came the conquistadors, dropouts from Francisco Pizarro'sexpedition against the Incas. Then the bandeirantes, the slavetraders, followed by the diamond hunters and the garimpeiros, thegold prospectors. Next the rubber barons, who were crueler andgreedier than the slavers, then the loggers and ranchers, soonjoined by the industrialists and power dam builders, chewing up therain forest with their voracious machines at the rate of 80,000square miles a year.   And now tourists.   The amazing Amazon, the widest, wettest and, so NationalGeographic now affirms, the longest river in the world (4,007miles, 51 longer than the Nile), boasts the longest snake, the mostvenomous viper, the biggest rat, beetle and ant, along withrazor-toothed piranhas that can reduce a Brahman steer to raw bonesin minutes and electric eels delivering 640 volts, enough to drivea Metro-North commuter train. This surging, swarming stream, veinedby 1,000 tributaries, that on its majestic march from the Andes tothe Atlantic carries one-fifth of the fresh water discharged intothe sea by all rivers of the world, now has seen it all.   Tourists, yet. No wonder the crocodiles stared with jaws agapefrom the seclusion of gigantic Victoria Regia lily pads, and thepumas and jaguars fled into the forest fastness.   The strange thing is that our mini-liner, small enough tonavigate the Amazon's side channels, avoiding the freighter andbarge traffic in the broad mainstream, was as much a novelty to thenatives unencumbered by cameras as they were to us.   Smiling and wide-eyed, they swarmed about with blowguns,javelins, bows and arrows to sell for only a few dollars or barterfor the clothes off your back. Mask makers, a declining skill,offered replicas of the palm fiber Yagua headdress, framed withshoulder-length blonde braids, that erroneously gave the Amazon itsname. Gaspar de Caravaj, a Dominican friar who accompanied theconquistadores in 1541, mistook the local tribesmen in theirshoulder-length headdresses for women warriors. In his journal hegave the name Amazon to the river, after the lady legionnaires ofGreek legend, writing of ``battling warrior women who fought as 10Indian men.''   The tourist incentive is to see it all before it is too late.   ``The forest is all gone south of here. Who knows what will beleft by the end of the century?'' lamented Serafim Bastedo, a dockcrane operator at Belem, 90 miles from the mouth, the largest cityon the Amazon.   Now a city of l.2 million, with 24-story high-rise apartments, ahuge manganese plant, open-pit iron mines, modern hospitals and asix-lane highway to Brasilia 1,000 miles to the south, Belem is aboom town of jarring contrasts.   The luxurious Hilton Hotel is flanked by side streets of narrowPortuguese houses, a door and two windows wide, out of the l7thcentury. Its shopping district pulsates to a samba beat broadcastat top volume from municipal loudspeakers.   ``Brazilians can't live without noise,'' Serafim shouts over thedin.   The yacht club shares the riverfront with a rickety fishingfleet out of another century, jungle medicine stalls selling driedsnakeskins filled with herbs, bones and feathers, and a sprawlingoutdoor market with hundreds of tarpaulin-covered restaurantsredolent of roasting cassava and pato no tucupi, duck stewed in atangy yellow soup. On the far shore lies Marajo Island, bigger thanDenmark, rangeland for 400,000 Brahman cattle.   Belem's excellent Goeldi nature preserve keeps alive in a junglesetting the Amazon's more bizarre residents: the 38-foot-longanaconda, the deadly bushmaster, the endangered manatee, the4-foot-long rat called the capybara, exotically plumed and beakedparrots and toucans, long-tailed squirrel monkeys and lumbering,leathery tapirs, the Brazilian mammal that looks like the lovechild of Dumbo and Miss Piggie.   A few miles upstream the street lights vanish and the rainforest resumes.   Two Brazilian pilots, sharing four-hour shifts, keep watch forshifting sandbars, sudden current shifts where tributaries enterand the writhing limbs of partially submerged trees toppled fromthe eroding red clay banks as we negotiate the narrowBreves-Macacos channel.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
