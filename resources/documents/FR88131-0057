The discussion assumesa basic familiarity with the high yield bond market. Additional informationabout the high yield bond market can be found in the references shown inAppendix I.Until 1977 the high yield bond market consisted primarily of ``fallen angels''_bondsof large companies, primarily conglomerates, railroads, and utility companies_whosecredit had been downgraded for various reasons. However, beginning around1977 the high yield bond market changed significantly. Companies with belowinvestment grade ratings, which traditionally obtained their long termcapital from private sources, commercial banks, or equity markets, beganissuing below investment grade, high interest rate bonds, commonly referredto as ``junk bonds'', to raise capital. After growing from about $8.5 billion in 1977 to $29.2 billion \1\<NOTE/> in 1983, the high yield bond market evolved further in 1984as financiers and companies began to use funds raised from issuing highyield bonds to launch both friendly and hostile corporate takeover bidseither through tender offers or through leveraged buyouts. Another phaseof the market that has developed is the use of high yield bonds to financeeither corporate reorganizations or to resist takeover attempts. As a result,many corporations have issued increasing amounts of debt. As of June 1987,total high yield bond issues outstanding were estimated at about $150 billion.This is about 20% of the total corporate straight (non-convertible) debtmarket, up from 3.5% in 1977. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Average total outstanding low rated straight (non-convertible)public corporate debt. As high yield bonds became a source of financing for corporate takeovers,especially hostile takeovers, the Congress became concerned about the implicationsfor American business. Since 1985, the Congress has held numerous hearingson the subject of hostile takeovers and the use of high yield bonds asa mechanism to finance them. A number of issues were discussed in thesehearings including 1. Concerns about the risks to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation(FSLIC) represented by those federally insured savings institutions whichinvest extensively in high yield bonds; 2. Whether investing in takeover related high yield bonds is an appropriaterole for a federally insured home mortgage lending institution; 3. Whether tax policy should be changed to restrict the use of high yieldbonds as a tool to finance corporate takeovers; and 4. The effect of increased debt, either as a result of a takeover situationor from using bonds rather than equity as a source of corporate financing,on the long term financial stability and growth prospects of American business.Several legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress to limitthe use of high yield bonds to finance takeovers by imposing a moratorium,using tax code provisions to disallow interest deductions to the issuers,applying credit margin requirements to investors, or prohibiting outrightthe holding of high yield bonds by federally insured institutions. Thislegislative focus has been twofold, involving concern over the relationshipof high yield bonds to takeover activity as well as concern over the inherent``riskiness'' of these bonds as investment vehicles for federally insuredinstitutions. None of these proposals have been enacted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Objectives, Scope and Methodology of GAO Study </ITAG>Section 1201 of the Competitive Equality Banking Act specifically requiresGAO to include in its study:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The identity and rating (as determined by Moody's, Standard and Poor'sor other nationally recognized bond rating house) of the issuers of thesebonds; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The identity of the major purchasers of these bonds, including butnot limited to federally insured depository institutions; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The percentage of the total amount of high yield, non-investmentgrade bonds that are issued as a method of financing corporate takeovers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The identity of the purchasers, including but not limited to federallyinsured depository institutions, that invest in high yield, non-investmentgrade bonds that are issued as a method of financing corporate takeovers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The purposes for which high yield, non-investment grade bonds areissued other than for financing corporate takeovers; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A summary and analysis of the adequacy of current state and federallaws that regulate investment in high yield, non-investment grade bondsby investors, including but not limited to federally insured depositoryinstitutions and pension funds; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A review of the impact of the issuance of and investment in highyield, non-investment grade bonds upon corporate debt as it relates tofederal monetary policy.</ITAG>The Act further requires that GAO examine all other types of direct investmentsmade by federally insured institutions and the effect these investmentshave had on federal deposit insurance funds. The principal tasks of GAO's study are to provide the Congress with accuratedata and information on the nature of the high yield, non-investment gradebond market and to assess public policy considerations relating to themarket. In addressing these topics, the study will be concerned with theuse of these bonds in corporate takeovers, especially hostile takeovers,and with the possible risks to the safety and soundness of federally insuredinstitutions which invest in the bonds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Topics on Which GAO Is Seeking Comment </ITAG>GAO is soliciting information which would clarify the Congress' understandingof the high yield bond market and identify current problems, if any, inthe high yield bond market. We are interested in receiving any suggestedfederal regulatory or legislative changes. To guide comments, the questionsbelow are organized around the topics the Act has directed GAO to includein its study. Those commenting are urged to be specific, citing whereverpossible quantitative information in support of their positions. Respondentsare also encouraged to bring to GAO's attention any matter pertinent tothe inquiry that is not specifically addressed in the following sections.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issuers of High Yield Bonds </ITAG>GAO has found that much information is available on publicly traded highyield bonds, but little information is available on the role and significanceof privately placed high yield bonds. Questions 1. How large, in terms of dollar volume and number of issues, is the privateplacement high yield bond market? 2. To what extent in the past five years has the private placement marketbeen affected by the growth of the publicly traded high yield bond market?Is the growth of publicly traded low grade bond offerings mostly a rechannelingof corporate borrowing away from individually negotiated loans toward publicsecurities, as some commentators suggest? 3. To what extent are privately placed bonds used to finance corporatetakeovers? Investors In High Yield Bonds According to investment bankers, the major investors in high yield bondsare mutual funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and federally insuredthrift institutions. Other categories of investors include individuals,foreign investors and corporations. Commercial banks do not invest in highyield bonds because of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Comptrollerof Currency and Federal Reserve Board restrictions. Federally insured and federally chartered thrifts may invest up to 11 percentof their assets in these bonds. Federally insured, state chartered thriftsmay invest more than 11 percent of their assets in high yield bonds, dependingon individual state laws and regulations. Data maintained by the Bank Boardshows that 80% of the $10 billion in high yield bonds held by all thriftsare owned by only 10 institutions. Some of these institutions hold morethan 11 percent of their assets in high yield bonds. At congressional hearings Federal Home Loan Bank Board witnesses have testifiedas to their concerns about federally insured thrift institution investmentsin high yield bonds. The Board's concerns fall into two areas: (1) Theissue of risk to the FSLIC presented by extensive involvement of thriftsin the junk bond markets, and (2) whether federally insured lenders whoare subsidized to provide a commitment to housing finance should be investingin high yield bonds which have been issued to finance corporate takeovers.Questions1. How does the riskiness of high yield bonds compare to other investmentsand activities, such as commercial loans, that thrift institutions mayenter into? In evaluating risk, what factors should be considered and arethere ways to quantify these risk factors? 2. Two studies indicate that compared to Treasury bonds and investmentgrade corporate bonds, historically the return of high yield bonds hasmore than compensated high yield bond holders for additional risks of default(See Appendix I: Studies). What are the analytical strengths and weaknessesof these studies? Given the growth and change in the composition of thehigh yield bond market in the past several years, are historical risk andreturn factors necessarily a guide to the future? 3. How adequate are state laws and regulations governing investments byfederally insured institutions in high yield bonds? Should state charteredinstitutions be subject to the same limitation of assets (11 percent) asfederally chartered institutions? 4. What is the best way to protect FSLIC from unreasonable risk as a resultof thrift investments in high yield bonds? Some suggestions that have beenmade include restrictions or prohibitions on bond purchases, increasedcapital requirements, risk-based insurance premiums, additional regulationto require an appropriate credit analysis before purchase, and diversificationof bond holdings. 5. From a public policy viewpoint, should federally insured institutionsbe restricted from purchasing high yield bonds which were issued in connectionwith the financing of a hostile takeover or a leveraged buyout? 6. Many bonds that are issued to finance takeovers and leveraged buyoutsare likely to be repaid in whole or in part from the sale of assets ratherthan from future earnings. As an investment, are asset backed bonds riskierthan bonds whose repayment is based on expected earnings? To what extent,if any, has the stock market turmoil of October 1987 increased the riskinessof bonds issued in connection with takeovers and leveraged buyouts? 7. Some investors actively trade high yield bonds in the secondary market.How large is the secondary market for these bonds? Can this market be maintainedin the event of an economic downturn? To what extent was trading (priceand volume) in the secondary market affected by the October 1987 stockmarket decline? 8. Private pension plans, the benefits of which are federally insured,are permitted to invest in high yield bonds. However, there are no requirementsthat such investments be especially reported to the Department of Labor.Should there be any special reporting requirement for high yield bonds?Is there any indication that pension funds may be investing too heavilyin high yield bonds either directly or indirectly through insurance companyannuities or mutual funds? Role of High Yield Bonds in Increased Corporate Leverage In the past several years significant concern has been expressed in Congressionalhearings and elsewhere that the level of debt being assumed by some non-financialcorporations is excessive. Citing Federal Reserve Board statistics, someof which indicate that debt to equity ratios have reached historicallyhigh levels, some observers warn that in the event of a business downturnor a substantial rise in interest rates, corporations with high debt burdensmay not be able to meet their debt obligations and a high level of defaultsmay occur. This could pose significant risks for the financial system andthe economy as a whole. The extent to which high yield bonds have contributed to the growth ofdebt and an increased leveraging of corporations is unclear. Some observersbelieve that the growth of the high yield bond market, particularly theuse of high yield bonds to finance corporate takeovers, corporate financialrestructuring and leveraged buyouts, together with associated retirementsof equity, has been a significant factor leading to increased leveragingand risk to the economy. Others have discounted the significance of thehigh yield bond market, pointing out that although this segment of thebond market has grown significantly, it still represents less than 25 percentof total new bond issues. Also, proponents of the high yield bond marketquestion whether there is a leveraging problem at all. They argue thateven though the amount of new debt assumed has been large in absolute terms,at market value the ratio of debt to equity has actually declined sincethe mid-1970's because of the rising equity value of domestic corporations.Questions 1. The Federal Reserve Board reports the relationship of total debt tototal equity of nonfinancial corporations in two ways, as shown by thefollowing table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Debt-to-Equity Ratios for Nonfinancial Corporations </T4><H1>End of period </H1><H1>Debt (par) \1\ </H1><H2>Equity (current) (percent) </H2><H1>Debt (market) \2\ </H1><H2>Equity (market) (percent)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">1962 <D>38.2 </D><D>42.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1964 <D>40.4 </D><D>37.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1966 <D>42.8 </D><D>43.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1968 <D>45.4 </D><D>35.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1970 <D>46.4 </D><D>48.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1971 <D>45.5 </D><D>46.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1972 <D>45.4 </D><D>45.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1973 <D>45.1 </D><D>61.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1974 <D>40.8 </D><D>91.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1975 <D>37.8 </D><D>72.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1976 <D>37.0 </D><D>72.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1977 <D>37.6 </D><D>84.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1978 <D>36.9 </D><D>87.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1979 <D>36.7 </D><D>79.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1980 <D>35.1 </D><D>60.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1981 <D>35.3 </D><D>70.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1982 <D>36.6 </D><D>71.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1983 <D>37.1 </D><D>63.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984 <D>42.4 </D><D>75.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985 <D>47.3 </D><D>70.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1986 <D>53.0 </D><D>69.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1987 (2nd quarter, estimated) <D>55.4 </D><D>57.1 </D><F>\1\ Debt is valued at par, and equity is balance sheet net worth withtangible assets valued at replacement cost. </F><F>\2\ The market value of debt is a staff estimate based on par valueand ratios of market to par values of NYSE bonds; equity is market valueof outstanding shares.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Which of these ratios most appropriately measures the significance of corporatedebt? Is there another measure that is more meaningful such as earningsor cash flow coverage of debt services?  2. The publicly traded high yield bond market has grown from less than$3 billion in new issues in 1982 to about $34 billion in 1986. One reasonfor this growth appears to be a shift in corporate financing from additionalstock, private placement bonds or bank loans to publicly traded bonds.What implications, if any, does this change in the source of corporatecapital have on monetary policy? 3. It has been alleged that much of the increased corporate leverage isthe result of using high yield bonds to finance takeovers, takeover defensesand leveraged buyouts. The outcome is often highly leveraged corporationswhich must sell assets and restrict spending to meet debt obligations.Should regulatory and tax policy be changed to make the use of high yieldbonds in takeovers and leveraged buyouts less attractive? 4. Others allege that the preference for debt over equity financing arisesfrom the double taxation of dividends and the deductibility of interestfor tax purposes. What effect will the lower tax rate have on financingdecisions? What would be the merits of eliminating double taxation of dividends?5. How can it be determined if corporate debt to equity ratios are toohigh or too low? If they are believed to be too high or low, what, if anything,should the Government do about it? <ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix I </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Hearings </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Congress, House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs,Subcommittee on General Oversight and Investigations.
