Sensible pricing isn't what some financial people say it is. Itisn't, for example, a hunch, a feeling or an expectation. It isn'tsomething from a guru's imagination. It isn't always what yourbroker says it is.   Instead, the market itself is probably the best measure ofsensible prices. It has a long record, and when prices depart fromthe long-term trends the market is usually saying something youshould listen to.   It did that in late 1987, when it indicated tremendousoverpricing. Those who heeded the warning escaped the crash. Thosewho believed in ever-higher prices took their licks when the marketcorrected to sensible levels.   Here are some of the measures, as calculated by Wright Investors'Service, an international research and portfolio management companybased in Bridgeport, Conn.:   _Price-earnings ratios.   On the basis of reported earnings, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500stock average is now priced about 11.5 times estimated 1989earnings. That compares with an average PE of 13 for the past fiveyears, and 11.5 for the past 20 years. It is slightly below themarket's average of 12.7 since World War II.   _Price-cash flow.   The Sandamp;P industrials are now priced about 6.8 times estimated 1989corporate cash flow. The average of the past five years is 6.5. Theaverage for the past 20 years is 6.4.   _Price-equity.   The Sandamp;P 500's current 2.0 price-equity multiple is a good dealhigher than the 1.8 average of the past five years, the 1.5 averageof the past 20 years and the 1.7 multiple of the past 40 years.   However, says Wright, ``adjusting reported equity values forretained earnings to account for the stock buybacks and buyoutswhich have diluted equity since 1983 brings the price-equity ratioto 1.77.''   _Price-sales.   The Sandamp;P industrials today are priced at about 63 percent ofestimated 1989 sales. The average price-sales ratio of the past fiveyears is 58 percent. For the past 20-years the average is 57 percent.   _Price-operating profits.   After-tax profits from current production rose sharply for U.S.corporations from 1982 through 1986. From midyear 1982 to midyear1986 they jumped 125 percent, providing the basis for a 129 percentrise in the Sandamp;P 500.   After the 1986 peak, operating profits retreated and have beenfairly flat recently. Currently, they are 10 percent below their1986 peak, while the Sandamp;P 500 is up more than 14 percent over thesame period.   The Sandamp;P 500 is now about 206 percent of its 1969-1988 averageprice; operating profits are 172 percent of the 1969-1988 average,leading Wright to comment that ``in relation to operating profits,stock prices have gotten somewhat ahead of themselves.''   This is Wright's overall conclusion: ``If the valuations of thepast 20 years are any guide, the stock market is currently a littleon the high side.''   Wright researchers acknowledge one current activity thatconceivably could change measurements. ``If corporate takeovers arehere to stay, a new norm and higher valuations may be appropriate,''they say. But they add a caveat:   ``WIS is skeptical that a `new era' of stock valuation has begun.The heightened takeover activity of the past five years has no doubtinflated the asking price of many stocks, but it has also raised theoverall ... risk.''   Wright's forecast: The stock market may be expected to move intobetter line with earnings over the course of 1989. At best, this maymean more of the same essentially sidewards price trend of the pastsix months.   ``A new bull market in equities may have to wait until 1990. Bondreturns are likely to exceed equity returns during 1989.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon., Jan. 30.</NOTE></DOC>
