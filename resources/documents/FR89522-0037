Statutorv Provisions In December 1975, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act(EPCA) in response to the energy crisis created by the oil embargo of 1973-74,and to the level of oil imports (35.8 percent of the nation's oil needsin 1975) and of oil imports from OPEC sources (22.0 percent of the nation'soil needs and 61.6 percent of all imports in 1975). Based on the relativelylow average fuel economy of cars at that time (14 mpg for model year (MY)1974 cars) and on a Congressionally mandated report by the Department ofTransportation and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the potentialfor improving that average, Congress included a provision in that Act establishingan automotive fuel economy regulatory program. That provision added a newtitle, Title V, to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.Title V specified corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passengerautomobiles of l8, 19 and 20 mpg for model years (MY) 1978, 1979 and 1980,respectively, and 27.5 mpg for MY 1985 and thereafter. Congress selectedthose standards after careful consideration of the DOT/EPA report submittedto Congress pursuant to section 10 of the Energy Supply and EnvironmentalCoordination Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-319). The Secretary of Transportation, as delegated to the Administrator of NHTSA,was required to establish standards for MY 1981-84. Section 502(a)(3) requiredthat the standards for each of those model years be set at a level which(1) was the maximum feasible average fuel economy level and (2) would resultin steady progress toward meeting the 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1985. Indetermining the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level,'' the agencyis required by section 503(e) to consider the following four factors: (1)Technological feasibility, (2) economic practicability, (3) the effectof other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and (4) the needof the nation to conserve energy. Section 502(a)(4) authorizes, but does not require, NHTSA to amend thestandard of 27.5 mpg for MY 1985 or any subsequent model year. If the standardfor a particular model year is amended, it must be set at the maximum feasibleaverage fuel economy level for that year. While Title V provides no expressguidance concerning the appropriate circumstances for the exercise of itsdiscretion to amend, the agency is guided by the purposes of EPCA and bythe statutory scheme of Title V. As the agency has explained in severalnotices in the past, it believes that the exercise of its discretion consistentwith those factors is required by the provision in the Administrative ProcedureAct stating that an agency's discretionary decision will be set aside ifit is ``arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise notin accordance with law.'' 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). While compliance with fuel economy standards is determined by averagingthe fuel economy ratings of the various models produced by each manufacturer,enabling them to produce vehicles with fuel economy below the level ofthe standard if they produce sufficient numbers of vehicles with fuel economyabove the level of the standard, manufacturers may not average their importedcars together with their domestically manufactured cars. Instead, a manufacturer'simported and domestically manufactured fleets each must separately meetfuel economy standards. (See section 503(b) of the Act.) Cars are consideredto be domestically manufactured if they have at least 75 percent domesticcontent. Conversely, cars are considered to be imports, or as the statutecharacterizes them, ``not  domestically manufactured,'' if they have lessthan 75 percent domestic content. While a separate fuel economy standard is set for each model year, TitleV does not require absolute achievement of the standard by manufacturersfor each particular model year. Instead, it allows a shortfall in one year(or years) to be offset if a manufacturer exceeds the standard for anotheryear (or years). Under the Act, as amended by the Automobile Fuel EfficiencyAct of 1980, manufacturers earn credits for exceeding average fuel economystandards which may be carried back for three model years or carried forwardfor three model years. If a manufacturer still does not meet the standard,after taking credits into account, it has committed ``unlawful conduct''under section 507 of the Act, and is liable to the Federal government forcivil penalties under section 508. I-B. Setting and Implementing the MY 1981-84 Standards On June 30, 1977, NHTSA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (42 FR 33534) a final rule establishing theMY 1981-1984 passenger automobile CAFE standards. The selected standardswere 22.0 mpg for 198l, 24.0 mpg for 1982, 26.0 mpg for MY 1983 and 27.0mpg for MY 1984. For a description of the analysis underlying those standards,see the August 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 53 FR 33080,August 29, 1988. Between January and May of 1979, NHTSA received a number of submissionsfrom Ford and General Motors (GM) on the MYs 1981-1984 fuel economy standardsfor passenger automobiles asserting that those standards should be reduced.In response to these submissions, the agency published a document entitled``Report on Requests by General Motors and Ford to Reduce Fuel EconomyStandards for MY 1981-85 Passenger  Automobiles,'' DOT HS-804 731, June1979. The report concluded that the standards were technologically feasibleand economically practicable and noted that both companies had submittedproduct plans for meeting the standards. Report, p. 14. One year later, the nation was in the midst of another energy crisis, broughton by events in Iran. Gasoline prices were rising rapidly  creating significantlyincreased consumer demand for small cars. The U.S. city average retailprice for gasoline rose from 88 cents per gallon in 1979 to $1.22 in 1980.(In 1988 dollars, this increase was from $1.37 in 1979 to $1.74 in 1980.)In light of these changed conditions, the industry announced plans to significantlyexceed the 27.5 mpg standard for 1985. Both Ford and GM, as well as Chryslerand American Motors (now a part of Chrysler), indicated that they expectedto achieve average fuel economy levels in excess of 30 mpg for that modelyear. Product plans submitted to NHTSA by those companies indicated thatthe projections assumed significant mix shifts toward smaller cars andsmaller engines, as well as rapid introductions of new technology. Conditions affecting fuel economy changed dramatically in the early 1980's,following completion of decontrol of domestic oil and other external factorsthat increased available supplies. Gasoline prices did not continue torise but instead declined over time. This, combined with economic recovery,caused consumer demand to shift back toward larger cars and larger engines.Data submitted to the agency by GM and Ford in mid-1983 indicated thatinstead of achieving fuel economy well in excess of the 27.5 mpg standardfor MY 1985, they would be unable to meet the level prescribed by the standard.I-C. Rulemakings to Amend the MY 1986-1988 Standards In March 1985, both GM and Ford submitted petitions for rulemaking requestingthat NHTSA reduce the passenger automobile average fuel economy standardfor the 1986 model year and beyond from 27.5 mpg to 26.0 mpg. The petitionersstated that factors beyond their control, including lower gasoline pricesand resultant greater consumer demand for larger cars and engines, hadreduced their fuel economy capability. NHTSA granted the GM and Ford petitionsin a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 12344) on March 28, 1985. In conducting rulemaking in response to the GM and Ford petitions, NHTSAproceeded from the premise that because the Cost Savings Act had imposeda long-term obligation on manufacturers to achieve a 27.5 mpg fuel economylevel, it would be inappropriate to exercise its discretion to reduce thestandard if a current inability to meet the standard simply resulted fromthe manufacturers previously declining to take appropriate steps to improvetheir average fuel economy as required by the Act. The agency thereforeevaluated the manufacturers' past efforts to achieve higher levels of fueleconomy as well as their immediate capabilities. On September 30, 1985, NHTSA issued a final rule which reduced the MY 1986standard from 27.5 mpg to 26.0 mpg (50 FR 40528, October 4, 1985). Theagency concluded that GM and Ford, constituting a substantial share ofthe industry, had taken or planned reasonable steps to meet the 27.5 mpgstandard in MY 1986 and made significant progress toward doing so, butwere prevented from fully implementing those steps by unforeseen events.The decline in gasoline prices, which began in 1982, had been expectedto be temporary and quickly reverse, but instead continued. The agencyconcluded that, among other things, there had been a substantial shiftin expected consumer demand toward larger cars and engines, and away fromthe more fuel-efficient sales mixes previously anticipated by GM and Ford.The agency's analysis indicated that this shift was largely attributableto the continuing decline in gasoline prices and that the only actionsavailable to those manufacturers to improve their fuel economy in the remainingtime for MY 1986 would have involved product restrictions likely resultingin significant adverse economic impacts, including sales losses well intothe hundreds of thousands of cars and job losses well into the tens ofthousands, and unreasonable restrictions on consumer choice. The reductionof the MY 1986 standard based on that analysis was subsequently upheldby the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals as consistent with the provisionsof the Act and within the agency's discretion. <T3>Public Citizen</T3> v. <T3>NHTSA,</T3> 848 F.2d 256, 264 (D.C. Cir. 1988).On October 1, 1986, NHTSA issued a final rule which reduced the MY 1987-88standards from 27.5 mpg to 26.0 mpg (51 FR 35594, October 6, 1986). Theagency again concluded that manufacturers had made reasonable efforts atcompliance, but that these efforts had been overtaken by unforeseen events,whose effects could not be overcome by available means within the timeavailable. NHTSA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[B]oth GM and Ford have continued to make significant technologicalimprovements in their fleets and have had reasonable plans to meet CAFEstandards. In a situation where unforeseen events, including changes inconsumer demand or changes in the competition's product offerings, overtakea manufacturer's reasonable product plan, the agency does not considerit consistent with the Act to ``hold'' the manufacturer to carrying outa product plan that has become economically impracticable. (51 FR 35611)</ITAG>In evaluating the reasons for GM's and Ford's declining MY 1987-88 CAFEprojections, the agency noted that the companies appeared to be applyingthe same technologies as planned in late 1983. In the case of GM, NHTSAstated that the two major reasons for the decline in GM's CAFE projectionswere net engine and model mix shifts and engine and transmission improvementprograms not yielding projected gains. The great majority of the factorsreducing Ford's CAFE projections were due to net shifts in projected salesfor models and engines, engine efficiency improvements not yielding projectedgains, and new models not meeting initial weight targets. The agency thusconcluded that the major reasons for the decline in both GM's and Ford'sMYs 1987-88 CAFE projections were largely beyond those companies' control.(51 FR 35610) NHTSA's analysis further indicated that the only actions then availableto those manufacturers to raise the fuel economy of their domestic fleetsto 27.5 mpg in MYs 1987-88 would involve a combination of (1) product restrictionslikely resulting in significant adverse economic impacts, including substantialjob and sales losses and unreasonable restrictions on consumer choice,and (2) transfer of the production of large cars outside of the UnitedStates, thereby costing American jobs, while having no energy conservationbenefits. (51 FR 35594) I-D. Petitions to Amend the MY 1989-90 Standards The agency received five petitions to amend the passenger car CAFE standardsfor MY 1989-90. The petitioners included GM, the Automobile Importers ofAmerica, Inc. (AIA), Mercedes-Benz, Austin Rover, and the Competitive EnterpriseInstitute (CEI). All of the petitioners sought rulemaking to set thoseCAFE standards below 27.5 mpg, with four of them basing their request onthe reported prospective inability of automobile manufacturers to meetthe statutorily set standard of 27.5 mpg. The basis for the fifth petition(CEI) was the contention that the CAFE program has caused an increase inmotor vehicle fatalities. I-E. NPRM for MY 1989-90 On August 29, 1988, NHTSA published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 33080) an NPRM concerning the MY 1989-90passenger automobile average fuel economy standards. The agency statedthat it was seeking public comment on whether to reduce the standards forMY 1989, MY 1990, or both, within a range of 26.5 mpg to 27.5 mpg. NHTSAstated that it was taking this action to determine whether retaining the27.5 mpg standard would have a significant, adverse effect on U.S. employmentor on the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry. The agency invitedand received both written and oral comments on the proposal. A public meetingwas held on September 14, 1988, in Washington, DC, to receive the oralcomments. The comment period for the proposed MY 1989 standard closed on September15, 1988, and the comment period for the proposed MY 1990 standard closedon October 28, 1988.I-F. Final Rule for MY 1989  On September 30, 1988, NHTSA issued a final rule which reduced the MY 1989standard from 27.5 mpg to 26.5 mpg (53 FR 39275, October 6, 1988). Theagency determined that 26.5 mpg was the ``maximum feasible average fueleconomy level,'' after balancing the statutory criteria of economic practicability,technological feasibility, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards,and the need of the nation to conserve energy. While the 26.5 mpg standard for MY 1989 represented a lowering of the statutorystandard, it also represented an increase from the standards for MY 1986-88.NHTSA noted that its action was thus consistent with the fact that thenation's conservation needs are greater now than they were in 1985, whenthe agency first set the standard at 26.0 mpg. The agency stated that ``(b)alancingthe agency's view about what level of standard is economically practicablefor MY 1989 against the nation's conservation needs, NHTSA believes thata proper balance between these factors can be reached by increasing thestandard to 26.5 mpg, a 0.5 mpg increase over the 1988 level.'' 53 FR 39302. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Comments for MY 1990 </ITAG>Comments concerning the MY 1990 CAFE standard were received in severalstages. Many of the comments submitted by September 15, 1988, the commentdue date for MY 1989, addressed the CAFE levels for both MY 1989 and 1990.These comments were summarized and addressed in detail in the final rulefor the MY 1989 passenger vehicle CAFE standards, published on October6, 1988, and are incorporated by reference into this document (see 53 FR39275, 39280). The agency received additional comments by October 28, 1988,the separate closing date for MY 1990, as well as additional comments afterthat date. In most cases, these comments supplemented previously submittedcomments, but several individuals commented for the first time. It is theseadditional comments received by the agency that are summarized below. NHTSA considered the information and views in all comments that are relevantto the MY 1990 standard, and did not exclude from its consideration anymaterial because it was submitted in the context of the MY 1989 rulemaking.The agency will repeat summaries of comments contained in the October 6,1988 final rule to the extent this information is needed for the readabilityof this document.  The additional comments came from individuals, trade and special interestgroups, vehicle manufacturers, Members of Congress and State legislatures,as well as one State agency and one Governor. Some parties strongly supporteda reduction in the MY 1990 CAFE standard, while others strongly opposedsuch action.  The comments included follow-up submissions from three vehicle manufacturers:GM, Ford, and Volvo. GM provided additional information concerning itssurveys of intended purchasers regarding increased preferences for ``powerand pickup'', larger, more fully equipped cars, four door styling and decreasedconcern about fuel economy. GM stated that it believed the circumstanceshave not changed since NHTSA made its determination to set the MY 1989standard at 26.5 mpg, and it should make the same determination for MY1990 as well. GM believes that the core findings NHTSA made in determining the 26.5 mpglevel for MY 1989 still pertain: that is, GM has made reasonable effortsto achieve 27.5 mpg; a reduction to 26.5 mpg would have no appreciableeffect on real energy consumption; CAFE distorts the market and trade balanceby conferring an unearned competitive advantage on foreign manufacturers;and the risks of adverse effects on employment and our nation's economyaccompanying a failure to adjust the standard to the maximum feasible levelfar outweigh the benefit to any other interest that Congress expressedin the statute. Ford also supported the agency's decision to set the MY 1989 CAFE standardat 26.5 mpg, and stated its belief that the same conditions apply for MY1990. Ford supplemented its previous comments with a further discussionof estimates of the fuel economy benefits of specific technologies andan explanation of the vehicle weight penalty associated with the installationof automatic restraints. Ford discussed specific CAFE enhancing technologies, and estimated thepercent of penetration for these features within the MY 1990 timeframe.Generally, ``Ford fleet penetration for model years 1989-1990 of the majorityof these actions is between 70 and 100 percent.'' Ford believes that theagency's estimates, as presented in the MY 1989 Final Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (FRIA), are optimistic and do not clearly indicate what the agencyis using as a baseline. Ford acknowledges that some of its own estimateshave not been met, and this has been due to ``compromises necessary tosatisfy customer demands and competitive product pressures which arosesince our original estimates were made.'' Ford also explained its beliefs regarding the vehicle weight penalty associatedwith the installation of automatic restraints. The increase in weight dueto the added automatic restraint systems in the Tempo/Topaz and the Escortare 27 and 26 pounds respectively. However, Ford notes that, due to commonizationof parts, the actual difference between the manual restraint system offeredin Canada and automatic restraint systems offered in the United Stateswill be between 13-15 pounds. Ford provided detailed parts lists to demonstratethe estimated weight penalty. Volvo noted that certain of the safety features it provides its purchasers,which are in addition to those installed pursuant to any Federal requirements,include a laminated rear window, 3-point seat belts in rear outboard positions,dual front seat belt retractors, anti-submarining protection and rear seathead restraints. The weight range of the Volvo is 3250-3750 pounds. (Theoverall fleet average for MY 1988 was 3103 pounds.) Volvo projects a MY1990 CAFE level of 25.7 mpg, and does not believe that it can attain betterfuel economy by this model year without compromising Volvo's reputationfor safety and reliability. The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) submitted additional commentsfor MY 1990. While CEI argued that the agency's setting the standard at26.5 mpg would be better than the statutory 27.5 mpg, it believes thateven that is too high, because any standard which constrains large carsales will increase traffic deaths. CEI alleges that NHTSA, while agreeingthat the safety issue should be addressed_in a long-term context_hidesbehind the yearly standard-setting schedules as a way of not dealing withthe safety issue. CEI disputed NHTSA's responses to the safety issues in the MY 1989 finalrule. First, CEI takes issue with NHTSA's statement that ``not all CAFEgains come at the price of reducing weight'' as a way of ameliorating theeffects of a higher standard. CEI acknowledges that not all CAFE gainsinvolve weight reduction; however, it says that safety will be loweredif only some CAFE gains involve weight loss. Second, CEI disagrees withNHTSA's position that CAFE will affect which car makers produce these cars,but not the types of cars purchased by consumers. The agency has statedthat vehicle drivers will attempt to buy big cars if that is what theywant. They will buy from foreign competitors, buy minivans or keep theirold cars. CEI finds this potential consumer response to CAFE standardsto be undesirable because that organization does not consider minivansor old cars a safe option_minivans since they are not subject to the samesafety standards as passenger vehicles, and old cars since many of themwere not subject to certain Federal motor vehicle safety standards at thetime of their manufacture. The Energy Conservation Coalition (ECC) submitted additional comments.ECC has four basic criticisms of the agency's decision to adopt a standardof 26.5 mpg for MY 1989, which it believes would apply to any similar decisionfor MY 1990 as well. First, ECC argues that both GM and NHTSA consistentlyunderestimate the actual achievable CAFE level for GM, and that GM is notmaking use of all available technology. Second, ECC questions some of GM'sarguments concerning market-driven changes. Third, ECC notes the increasingshare of the trade deficit consisting of imported cars, trucks, parts,and fuel. And fourth, ECC states that the transportation sector is usingone million barrels more oil each day than in 1973, and that automobilesand light trucks account for 26 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, amajor greenhouse gas. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) submitted additional commentsto the docket. NRDC's basic argument is that the agency must undertakean environmental impact statement before any rollback in the MY 1990 standardcan occur. NRDC states that the agency is rushing this rulemaking and thatthis course of action produces poor results and violates the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. NRDC suggests that the agency is required by NEPA to consideralternatives and that its responsibility to consider raising the CAFE levelabove the 27.5 mpg level is as great as its responsibility to considerlowering the standard. Subsequent to the October 28, 1988 comment closing date, NHTSA receivedadditional comments. The agency received a November 22, 1988 letter fromthe Environmental Protection Agency regarding the MY 1990 standard. EPAnoted the recent increase in interest in ``the greenhouse effect'' andindicated that it was reviewing several government rulemakings to see ifany proposed actions would contribute to global warming. EPA agrees withNHTSA that action on one model year will not have a significant effecton the environment. EPA did indicate, however, it viewed a reduction inCAFE as ``directionally wrong'' as a general matter and said that vehicleenergy efficiency improvements are likely to be a major component in anyfuture domestic or international response to concerns about carbon dioxideemissions. In March 1989, EPA Administrator Reilly wrote to Secretary ofTransportation Skinner to raise similar concerns. In addition, to supplement the record for this proceeding, TransportationSecretary Skinner met with a broad spectrum of interested parties in February1989. The meetings were held with representatives of General Motors, Ford,the United Auto Workers, the Center for Auto Safety, the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute.<ITAG tagnum="84">III Decision for MY 1990 </ITAG>III-A. Summary After carefully considering the comments and other available information,NHTSA has decided not to amend the statutorily set 27.5 mpg CAFE standardfor MY 1990. This decision is based largely on the increasing need of thenation to conserve energy and a conclusion by the agency that retentionof the 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1990 will not have a significant adverseeffect on U.S. employment or on the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry.III-B. The Need of the Nation to Conserve Energy The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The importshare had reached 35.8 percent by 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and peakedat 46.5 percent in 1977, at a cost of $74 billion (stated in 1988 dollars).While the import share of total petroleum supply declined after that year,the cost continued to rise to a 1980 peak of $102 billion (1988 dollars).While the import share of petroleum supply declined through 1985, it hasbeen increasing since that time. In 1985, the import share was 27.3 percentat a cost of $50 billion (1988 dollars). For 1988, net imports were 37.0percent of total supply. Due to sharply lower petroleum prices, however,the value of imports declined from 1985 to 1988, from $50 billion to $37billion (1988 dollars). Imports from OPEC also declined through 1985 buthave been rising since that time. The nation's dependence on petroleum net imports since 1975 is summarizedin the following table: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1,tp0,i1,s50,10,10</C> <H1>Year</H1><H1>Net imports as percent of U.S. petroleum products supplied</H1><H2>From OPEC</H2><H2>From all countries</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">1975 average<D>22.0</D><D>35.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1977 average<D>33.6</D><D>46.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">*    *    *    *    * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985 average<D>11.6</D><D>27.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 1988<D>18.0</D><D>34.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1988 average<D>19.9</D><D>37.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 1989<D>N/A</D><D>41.0</D></ITAG></ITAG> The current energy situation and emerging trends point to the continuedimportance of oil conservation. The United States now imports a slightlyhigher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCAwas passed, and the percentage of its oil supplied by OPEC is similar tothat of 1975. Oil continues to account for well over 40 percent of U.S.energy use, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportationsector. While the U.S. is the second-largest oil producer, it containsonly three percent of the world's proved oil reserves. Moreover, provedreserves have declined from a peak of 39 billion barrels in 1970 to 27billion barrels in 1987. According to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) 1989 AnnualEnergy Outlook, domestic production for its ``base case'' projection isexpected to decline from 10.5 MMB/D in 1988 to 8.6 MMB/D in 1995, and 8.5MMB/D in 2000. Net imports are projected to increase from 6.3 MMB/D in1988 to 9.3 MMB/D in 1995 and 10.2 MMB/D in 2000. Thus, as a percentageof total U.S. petroleum use, EIA expects imports to rise from a 1988 levelof 37 percent to 52 percent of total supply in 1995 (exceeding the previous1977 high of 46.5 percent) and 55 percent in 2000. In its comment to the docket, the Department of Energy (DOE) emphasizedseveral points about transportation's role in U.S. oil use and the importanceof rising fuel efficiency. DOE noted that the 11 MMB/D used by the transportationsector in 1986 is almost 80% of total U.S. fuel use of oil and over 90%of the critical light product use. Thus, DOE wanted NHTSA to consider thatany significant moderation in growing oil demand will require large transportationefficiency improvements. DOE also emphasized that the 1987 EIA oil demandforecasts (cited in the NPRM) assume that average new car efficiency willcontinue to improve, which DOE said does not seem likely given fuel economytrends (at least to the levels assumed by EIA), and that even with theseprojected increases in fuel efficiency, U.S. oil demand is projected toincrease over 1.5 MMB/D by 2000. The level of petroleum imports is only one aspect of the total energy conservationpicture. Under EPCA and NEPA, for example, national security, energy independence,resource conservation, and environmental protection must all be considered.In March 1987, the Department of Energy submitted a report to the Presidententitled ``Energy Security.'' NHTSA believes that the following quotationfrom that report represents a useful summary of the national security andenergy independence aspects of the current energy situation: Although dependenceon insecure oil supplies is * * * projected to grow, energy security dependsin part on the ability of importing nations to respond to oil supply disruptions;and this is improving. The decontrol of oil prices in the United States,as well as similar moves in other countries, has made economies more adaptableto changing situations. Furthermore, the large strategic oil reserves thathave been established in the United States (and to a lesser extent, inother major oil-importing nations) will make it possible to respond farmore effectively to any future disruptions than has been the case in thepast. The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future includeboth opportunities and risks. The oil price drop of 1986 showed how consumerscan be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies ofoil and other energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices,this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the same time, the projectedincrease in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risksfor the United States and the free world. These risks can be summarizedas follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate theworld's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (orjust sharp upward and downward price swings), which would necessitate difficulteconomic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers.Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupta large volume of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf, inflicting severedamage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil priceincreases precipitated by the 1978-79 Iranian revolution contributed tothe largest recession since the 1930's. Similar or larger events in thefuture could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even militaryimplications. As to the environmental aspects of the energy problem, there has recentlybeen increasing awareness of the greenhouse effect and the role of oilconservation in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide, whichis one of the products of burning fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), isa major greenhouse gas. Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a substantial, and relativeto the mid-1980's, increasing, need for the nation to conserve energy.III-C. Analysis of Alleged Adverse Impacts of Retaining the 27.5 mpg StandardAs discussed above, NHTSA is provided full discretion by section 502 concerningwhether to amend CAFE standards. If the agency does amend the statutorilyset 27.5 mpg standard, it must set the new standard at the ``maximum feasibleaverage fuel economy level.'' If NHTSA decides to exercise its discretionnot to amend the statutory standard, it need not make a determination ofthe ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.'' Instead, the standardsimply remains at the Congressionally set level. While Title V providesno express guidance concerning the appropriate circumstances for the exerciseof its discretion to amend, the agency is guided by the purposes of EPCAand by the statutory scheme of Title V. NHTSA has previously identified two situations in which it would not exerciseits discretion to amend the statutorily set 27.5 mpg standard, even ifthe ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level'' was below 27.5 mpg.First, in all of its rulemakings to reduce the standard, NHTSA has emphasizedthat it would not consider it appropriate to reduce the standard if a currentinability to meet the standard simply resulted from manufacturers decliningto take sufficient steps to improve their average fuel economy as requiredby the Act. This approach was cited approvingly by the D.C. Circuit Courtof Appeals in upholding the agency's decision for MY 1986. The court stated:Lowering the statutory standard whenever the larger manufacturers assertcurrent inability to meet that standard would, without doubt, completelyvitiate the statutory scheme; recognizing this, NHTSA stressed its determinationthat the inability of GM and Ford to meet the higher standard did not resultfrom their ``previously declining to take appropriate steps to improvetheir average fuel economy as required by the Act.''<T3> Public Citizen</T3> v.<T3> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</T3>, 848 F.2d 256,264 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Second, NHTSA has stated that it will not retroactively amend a generallyapplicable standard for a particular model year, since such action wouldbe inconsistent with the statutory scheme. See 53 FR 15241, April 28, 1988;53 FR 39115, October 5, 1988.As suggested by those two examples, the decision whether to amend the statutory27.5 mpg standard for a particular model year involves broader considerationsthan a determination of the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.''An important distinction that should be made with respect to NHTSA's decisionconcerning whether to amend the MY 1990 standard is between the actualimpacts on manufacturers of retaining the 27.5 mpg standard and the theoreticalimpacts that would occur if manufacturers in fact achieved a CAFE of 27.5mpg for MY 1990. Once the agency has decided to exercise its discretionto amend and endeavored to determine the ``maximum feasible average fueleconomy level,'' NHTSA has followed a consistent approach of analyzingthe ability of manufacturers to meet the standard. It has not includedas part of its calculation of the standard the ability to pay penaltiesfor not meeting the standard, or the availability of, or need for, credits.(For a discussion of the reasoning behind that approach, particularly asto credits, see 51 FR 27224, July 30, 1986.) However, these latter factorsare crucial to the actual impacts of the agency's decision. The availability of carryforward credits to GM and Ford is of particularsignificance to the actual impacts of retaining the 27.5 mpg standard forMY 1990. Ford projects achieving a MY 1990 CAFE level of 26.6 mpg for its domesticfleet. By way of comparison, Ford's mid-model year report for 1988 indicatedthat its MY 19B8 CAFE will be 26.4 mpg, and its December 21, 1988 pre-modelyear report for 1989 indicated that it expects to achieve a MY 1989 CAFEof 26.6 mpg. While Ford projects a MY 1990 CAFE that is 0.9 mpg below thestatutory standard, it stated at the September 14 public hearing that itwould not do anything different (i.e., increase its efforts to improveits CAFE) if the standard remained at 27.5 mpg than if it were reduced,since it has a compliance plan using available carryforward credits earnedduring MY 1987-88. The MY 1987 credits will expire if they are not usedduring MY 1990. GM projects achieving a MY 1990 CAFE level of 27.0 mpg for its domesticfleet. By way of comparison, GM's mid-model year report for 1988 indicatedthat its MY 1988 CAFE will be 27.6 mpg and its December 30, 1988 pre-modelyear report for 1989 indicated that it expects to achieve a MY 1989 CAFEof 27.2 mpg. The issue of whether GM would have any carryforward creditsavailable for MY 1990 was dependent throughout much of this proceedingon the outcome of a case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit, <T3>Center for Auto Safety </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, which was decided on September 16, 1988. Now that the<T3>en banc </T3>court has vacated its earlier ruling and reinstated EPA'saction, it is clear that GM will have carryforward credits earned in MY1988 that could be applied against a MY 1990 shortfall. In addition, GM'sDecember 1988 pre-model year report for MY 1989 indicates that companyis likely to earn additional credits during MY 1989. GM's MY 1988 creditsalone are more than sufficient to offset its projected MY 1990 shortfallagainst the existing 27.5 mpg standard. NHTSA believes that, when manufacturers have substantial carryforward creditsavailable for a particular year, neither the statute nor the legislativehistory contemplated that the agency should necessarily reduce the statutory27.5 mpg standard for that year, even if the manufacturers have made reasonableefforts to comply and the ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level''might be below 27.5 mpg. This is particularly true when the need of thenation to conserve energy is steadily increasing. The three-year carryforward/carrybackcredit provisions were established in the Automotive Fuel Efficiency Actof 1980. The House report states that ``the Committee believes these changeswill act as an incentive to manufacturers to exceed the standards now setwhenever they can in order to build up credits to act as safeguards againstshortfalls that might occur in the future.'' House Report 96-1026, p. 20.If NHTSA always reduced a standard in the event that the major domesticmanufacturers expected a shortfall, there would be no incentive for thosemanufacturers to try to build up credits against future shortfalls, andcarryforward credits would never in fact be used against such shortfalls.Because of the availability of MY 1987 and/or MY 1988 carryforward creditsthat have already been earned by GM and Ford, and the likely availabilityof credits from MY 1989, NHTSA concludes that retention of the 27.5 mpgstandard for MY 1990 will not have any significant adverse effects on thosemanufacturers. This conclusion takes account of risks to those manufacturers'projections. Even if GM and Ford achieve MY 1990 CAFE levels somewhat belowtheir projections, they will still have sufficient credits to offset theshortfall. (NHTSA is not providing specific calculations of how far GMand Ford could go below their projections and still have available credits,because such calculations would reveal volume projections that are subjectto claims of confidentiality.) Assuming that GM and Ford used carryforward credits to offset a MY 1990shortfall, the expended credits would not be available for future modelyears. For Ford, which has MY 1987 and 1988 credits and expects a smallamount of MY 1989 credits as well, the MY 1987 credits would in any eventexpire if they are not used in MY 1990. GM would need to use most of itsMY 1988 credits for MY 1990, although a small portion of the MY 1988 creditsand all of its expected MY 1989 credits would be available for MY 1991.NHTSA now turns its attention to the potential impacts on other manufacturersof retaining the 27.5 mpg standard. A number of manufacturers are expectedto easily meet the standard. Chrysler projected in April 1988 that it wouldachieve a MY 1990 CAFE of 27.9 mpg. As NHTSA has discussed in prior rulemakings,Chrysler's CAFE has been higher than that of GM or Ford in recent yearsprimarily because it does not compete, or compete as heavily, in all themarket segments in which GM and Ford sell cars, particularly the largecar market. The Japanese and other Asian manufacturers are expected to easily exceedthe 27.5 mpg standard, in light of their traditional strength in smallercars. Nissan projects a MY 1990 CAFE level of 28.1 mpg to 28.6 mpg. Whilethe agency does not have MY 1990 CAFE projections for the other Asian manufacturers,their expected MY 1989 CAFE levels, as reported in their pre-model yearreports, are well above 27.5 mpg. Daihatsu anticipates achieving a MY 1989CAFE of about 45.3 mpg, Honda 31.5 mpg, Hyundai 32.9 mpg, Isuzu 37.3 mpg,Mazda 29.3 mpg, Mitsubishi 30.6 mpg, Subaru 31.9 mpg, Suzuki 38.5 mpg,and Toyota 31.7 mpg. The import fleets of GM, Ford and Chrysler also are expected to easilyexceed 27.5 mpg for MY 1990. GM projects a MY 1990 CAFE level of 38.3 mpgfor its import fleet, and Ford projects a CAFE level of 30.6 mpg. Whilethe agency does not have a MY 1990 CAFE projection for Chrysler's importfleet, that company's pre-model year report indicated that its import fleetwill achieve a CAFE level of 29.9 mpg for MY 1989. Most of the European manufacturers are expected to be below the 27.5 mpglevel for MY 1990. Austin Rover projects a MY 1989 CAFE level of 23.5 mpg,but did not project a figure for MY 1990. BMH projects a MY 1990 CAFE levelof 21.9 mpg, Jaguar 21.5 mpg, Mercedes-Benz 21.7 mpg, Peugeot 24.6 mpg,Porsche 23.0 mpg, Saab 26.6 mpg, and Volvo 25.7 mpg. The agency does nothave MY 1990 projections for Alfa-Romeo, Volkswagen or Yugo. Those companies'pre-model year reports indicated that their MY 1989 CAFE levels will be25.3 mpg, 30.1 mpg, and 34.2 mpg, respectively. Most European manufacturers would face two options: (1) Paying the statutorypenalties associated with failure to comply with fuel economy standards,or (2) drastic product actions which, in the case of some, could requireradical changes in the mix of cars they import. Several of the Europeancompanies have faced a similar choice during the past several model yearsand have in each instance chosen to pay the penalties. Thus, the actualimpact on the European manufacturers of retaining the 27.5 mpg standardwould be, for the most part, the paying of penalties. One of the petitioners requesting a reduction in the 27.5 mpg standard,the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), argued that retention of thestandard would have an adverse impact on safety. After the agency's NPRMwas published, CEI and several other commenters again asked the agencyto conclude that CAFE standards result in vehicle downsizing, and thatdownsizing, in turn, degrades safety. CEI and the other commenters advocatea CAFE standard around 24.0 mpg, which they believe would be the CAFE levelof the fleet in the absence of CAFE standards.CEI's argument is based on its claim of finding a direct relationship betweenvehicle weight and vehicle safety and on its conclusion that the CAFE programhas caused manufacturers to reduce vehicle size. CEI relies on the premisethat heavier cars are generally safer for vehicle occupants than smallercars, other things being equal. CEI then notes that downsizing (reducingvehicle weight and exterior dimensions) has been used extensively by themanufacturers as a means of improving CAFE. CEI states that these reductionsin car size and weight have resulted in less protection for occupants ofthese cars. CEI concludes that the CAFE standards are responsible for currentcar sizes and weights and thus, the CAFE standards also are responsiblefor a reduction in the level of safety otherwise available to the vehicleoccupants. CEI further asserts that if there were no CAFE standards, orif the standard were set so low as to be the essential equivalent of nostandard, the size and weight of current cars would be significantly greater.In support of these assertions, CEI attached a copy of a paper entitled``The Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on Automobile Safety'' by RobertW. Crandall and John D. Graham (1988). For convenience, this paper is referredto as ``Crandall/Graham'' throughout the remainder of this discussion.Crandall/Graham estimated that a 27.5 mpg standard for the 1990 model yearwould result in 2,200 to 3,900 additional occupant fatalities and 11,000to 19,500 additional serious injuries to occupants, as compared to expectedfatalities and serious injuries absent any CAFE standard. CEI concluded its argument with the following statement of its position:<ITAG tagnum="21">Neither Congress nor this agency has made any express determinationthat energy conservation under CAFE should require the loss of human life.It is CEI's position that, absent such a determination, a CAFE standardwhich<T3> does</T3> result in the loss of life is impracticable and is beyondthe ``need of the Nation to conserve energy'' under [15 U.S.C.] subsection2002(e). In short, such a standard has no statutory authorization. (Emphasisin original).</ITAG>Other commenters also addressed the question of whether there would besafety impacts associated with the 1990 model year CAFE standards. Mostof the other commenters that addressed the safety issue associated themselveswith the Crandall/Graham theory. These commenters included Consumer Alert,the Heritage Foundation, and the Council of Economic Advisors under then-PresidentReagan. However, none of these commenters offered any independent assessmentof the issue. Making a similar point, but based on different information, was the InsuranceInstitute for Highway Safety (IIHS). IIHS claimed that car size (definedas wheelbase length), as opposed to weight, is an important factor in theprotection afforded to vehicle occupants, because large cars, due to theirlarger crush space, offer greater occupant protection than small cars.IIHS asked the agency to carefully evaluate the effects of the CAFE standardfor the 1990 model year, to ensure that the CAFE standard will not degradethe level of occupant protection offered in 1990 cars by forcing manufacturersto decrease the size of those cars. The IIHS testimony at the public hearingstated:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * There is a point beyond which weight cannot be reduced withoutmaking vehicles smaller and thereby compromising safety. Furthermore, itseems probable that much of the potential weight reduction possible fromthe use of lighter weight materials has already been accomplished. Therefore,NHTSA must carefully evaluate the regulatory effects of the fuel economystandards to ensure that they do not degrade safety by forcing decreasesin car size. At this time, it seems certain that any toughening of theCAFE requirements would lead to smaller and therefore less safe cars.</ITAG>Conversely, IIHS suggested that safety could be affected negatively bya lower CAFE standard for MY 1990, if a lower standard results in largernumbers of larger displacement, high performance engines. IIHS suggestedthat larger engines would lead to greater performance, and that increasesin performance increase the chances of a car being in a crash and the chancesof the occupants being killed or injured. The National Safety Council filedcomments making points similar to those raised by IIHS. The Center for Auto Safety (CFAS), on the other hand, stated at the publicmeeting that there is no evidence that CAFE standards have a negative impacton the safety of vehicle occupants. CFAS stated that, in 1975, when theaverage fuel economy of the new car fleet was about 14 mpg, there were3.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. In 1988, when theaverage fuel economy of the new car fleet was about 28.7 mpg, fatalitiesper 100 million vehicle miles traveled had decreased to 2.4. Accordingto CFAS, these statistics suggest that manufacturers can improve both safetyand fuel economy at the same time. CEI's comments on the MY 1989-1990 NPRM made two additional points aboutthe safety implications of CAFE standards. First, CEI alleged that smallercars are less compatible with roadside objects, such as guardrails andbreak-away light poles, that were designed for a heavier vehicle population.CEI suggested that this poses additional hazards to occupants of smallercars. Second, CEI stated that it knows of no evidence to suggest that carswith higher performance, because of larger engines, negatively affect thesafety of occupants. Moreover, CEI argued that even if high performancecars present a real safety hazard in their own right, such cars would havelittle impact on overall safety because of their small market share. Infollow-up comments submitted in October 1988. CEI took issue with NHTSA'sreliance on the fact that not <T3>all</T3> CAFE improvements come at the price of weight reduction, becauseCEI contends that any weight reduction will result in lower safety levels.In its comments on the NPRM, CFAS stated that it disagreed with CEI's basicthesis that CAFE standards have a negative impact on safety by forcingmanufacturers to sell less safe, smaller cars. According to CFAS, fuel-efficientlarge cars can be and have been built, while small cars with very effectiveoccupant protection can be and have been built. Further, CFAS suggestedthat any reduction of the CAFE standard for the 1990 model year would resultonly in higher performance and bigger engines in existing car designs,which would negatively affect occupant safety, instead of resulting inlarger vehicles. NHTSA notes that it considered and rejected a similar contention by CEIwith respect to the safety consequences of the CAFE standards for the 1987-1988model year CAFE standards.<T3> See</T3> 51 FR 35612-35613. In commenting on the NPRM for MY 1989-90,CEI made arguments similar to those made previously, but also relied onthe Crandall/Graham analysis discussed above. The Crandall/Graham study relies on the assumption that the CAFE programhas forced the downsizing of the fleet and is responsible for the factthat the current fleet of new cars is lighter than it would have been inthe absence of CAFE. The agency agrees that cars in the new car fleet are,on average, about 1000 pounds lighter now than they were in 1975. But,as the agency has noted several times in the past, the reasons for thisdownsizing is unclear; i.e., whether it was the result of consumer demandfor more fuel-efficient models or a result of the CAFE standards. See,e.g., the preamble to the final rule for MY 1987-1988, 51 FR 35613. And,most downsizing occurred in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when manufacturerswere exceeding the applicable CAFE standards. The agency also observesthat the average vehicle weight of the new car fleet has not changed appreciablysince the early 198O's, although the average fuel economy of the fleethas steadily improved. Thus, the agency does not agree that the CAFE programis the primary reason for the fact that the average new car is lighterthan it was a decade ago, or in fact that there is a necessary relationshipbetween the CAFE program and vehicle weight. While the agency has indicatedin the past that weight reduction is a method to be used to improve CAFE,the statistics just cited do not tend to show a direct relationship betweenmanufacturer weight reduction activity and improved CAFE. With regard to this proceeding, NHTSA concludes, for the reasons discussedbelow, that there is no evidence demonstrating adverse safety consequencesthat would be associated with retaining the 27.5 mpg standard in MY 1990.First, it is clear that there is not a direct relationship between a manufacturer'sCAFE and the average weight of its fleet. For example, in MY 1988, theaverage weight of the GM fleet was 3329 pounds, at a CAFE of 27.6 mpg,while the Ford fleet weighed an average of 3276 pounds, with a CAFE of26.4 mpg. Thus, GM's fleet was both heavier and more fuel efficient thanFord's. This example illustrates the point that not all CAFE gains comeby reducing weight. Further, the new car fleet as a whole illustrates the same point. The overallnew car fleet (all domestics and imports combined) had an average fueleconomy of 28.2 mpg in MY 1987; yet, the average inertia weight of a newcar in MY 1987 was 3100 pounds, a two pound <T3>increase </T3>in weight over the average weight of a 1982 new car,when the overall fleet average fuel economy was only 26.6 mpg. Even more specifically, GM and Ford, the two manufacturers most affectedby this rulemaking, have been increasing their CAFE and fleet weight. Forexample, GM's estimated MY 1990 fleet weight is nearly 100 pounds higherthan that for MY 1986, but its CAFE is also higher by 0.4 mpg. Similarly,Ford's MY 1990 fleet weighs nearly 150 pounds more on average than thatfor MY 1983, but its CAFE is nearly 1 mpg higher in MY 1990. Clearly, thereare methods of improving fuel economy that do not depend on downsizingor weight reduction. Second, based on the record of this proceeding, NHTSA concludes that thelarge manufacturers are unlikely to take any actions to add weight to themodels already planned for sale during MY 1990, regardless of whether theagency were to reduce the standard. This conclusion is supported in therecord by the testimony of GM and Ford, both of which testified at thehearing that they would not make design changes (such as adding or deletingweight) to their MY 1990 models as a result of this rulemaking. The manufacturersalso believe that consumers who intend to purchase a larger vehicle willdo so; they will not be ``forced'' into a smaller vehicle than wanted.GM and Ford stated that, if they cannot produce such a vehicle, due toCAFE constraints, then the consumer will buy a large car from another manufacturer,or will buy a minivan, or will keep his or her older, large car. As previouslynoted, the agency does not believe GM and Ford will in fact encounter CAFEconstraints in MY 1990, due to the availability of carryforward credits.However, in a situation where such constraints would occur, the agencyagrees with the manufacturers that any one of those alternative consumeroutcomes is far more likely than the possibility that the consumer willbuy a smaller car than he or she wanted to buy. CEI commented anew in October 1988 that this rationale is not a viableoption for safety problems, since CEI believes that owners opting for avan or keeping their older cars is not <T3>safe, </T3>since mini-vans are not subject to the same safety standardsas passenger vehicles, and old cars were not subject to certain Federalmotor vehicle safety standards at the time of their manufacture. NHTSA strongly disagrees with CEI's characterization of the safety of mini-vans.As the agency noted in its ``Safety Programs for Light Trucks and MultipurposePassenger Vehicles'' report to Congress (April 1988). ``The fatality ratefor all light trucks is not appreciably different from the fatality ratefor passenger cars'' and ``The fatality rate for vans, including minivans,is less than average; in fact, it is close to that of large cars * * *[and superior to that of smaller cars]'' (See p. 3) More specifically,the fatality rates per million registered vehicles for 1986, the latestyear for which data were available for the report, were 211.2 for carsand 211.6 for all light trucks (pickups, vans, and utility vehicles). Moreover,the rate for vans, the vehicle type most likely to be a substitute forpassenger cars, has a lower than average fatality rate, 140, which is two-thirdsthat for the average passenger car. As the agency has often stated, theabsence of specific standards for specific vehicle types does not necessarilyindicate a lack of safety for such vehicles. While it is technically true that mini-vans are not subject to some ofthe Federal safety standards applicable to passenger cars (e.g., FMVSS216, <T3>Roof Crush Resistance</T3>), that factor has little if any bearingon the overall levels of safety provided by mini-vans. That important ``bottom-line''finding is aptly demonstrated by the statistic noted above, and can easilybe explained when one remembers that ``Federal standards'' are not thesole (or even primary) determinant of vehicle safety. First, most passenger-carsafety standards do in fact apply to mini-vans. Second, many mini-vansoffer safety performance (provided by manufacturers on a voluntary basis)at a level similar or equal to that required by a passenger-car standard,so that the non-applicability of the standard has little or no real-worldeffect. (For example, NHTSA understands that most mini-vans which havebeen tested do, in fact, meet FMVSS 216 performance levels.) Third, NHTSAhas in fact been extending passenger-car standards to mini-vans and otherlight vehicles where appropriate. See, e.g., extension of FMVSS 208 dynamictesting requirements (52 FR 44898, November 23, 1987), NPRM to requirehead restraints (53 FR 50047, December 13, 1988). NPRM to require rear-seatlap/shoulder belts (53 FR 47982, November 29, 1988), and discussion inApril 1988 light truck/multipurpose passenger vehicle report (pp. 22-30).Finally, mini-vans may in fact offer inherent superior crashworthinessprotection to occupants as compared to passenger cars, due their largersize and weight. Of course, for reasons previously discussed, NHTSA does not agree thata 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1990 is likely to have a constraining effecton the domestic manufacturers, and thus little if any consumer diversionfrom cars to mini-vans would be expected as a result of the CAFE standards(as opposed to natural market forces). But assuming arguendo that sucha CAFE-induced diversion did take place, the agency has no reason to believethat safety would be adversely affected as a result.While the agency generally agrees with the principle that, in multi-vehiclecrashes, heavier cars are safer than lighter cars, other things being equal,it does not believe that principle has any significant implications fora decision whether to retain the 27.5 mpg statutory standard. In response to the CEI comment that neither this agency nor Congress hasconsidered the potential safety consequences of the CAFE standards, theagency notes that it has considered the safety impacts of CAFE standardsin its rulemaking actions since the beginning of that program. The agency'sfirst final rule on CAFE establishing passenger car standards for the 1981-1984model years included a discussion of the safety impact of the standards.<T3>See </T3>42 FR 33534, 33551, June 30, 1977. The relationship betweensafety and CAFE standards was also discussed in the final rule amendingthe MY 1986 passenger car fuel economy standard (50 FR 40547-40548, October4, 1985), the final rule amending the 1987-88 passenger car fuel economystandards (51 FR 35612-35613, October 6, 1986), the NPRM for the MY 1989-90standards (53 FR 33094-95, August 29, 1988), the MY 1989 final rule (53FR 39292, October 6, 1988), and in this notice. Hence, the agency doesnot agree with the contention that it has not considered the safety issuein administering the CAFE program. As to Congressional consideration of the safety consequences of CAFE, theagency points to the 1974 report to Congress from the Department of Transportationand the Environmental Protection Agency entitled ``Potential for MotorVehicle Fuel Economy Improvements: Report to the Congress'', October 24,1974. This report was mandated by Congress and expressly considered byit during its deliberations on the legislation to establish the CAFE program.The report contained a discussion of the possible trade-offs in the areasof improved fuel economy, lower emissions, and increased occupant safety.The report summary noted that a sustained or increased shift to small cars,without a concurrent upgrading of their occupant protection capability,would likely lead to an increase in the rate of highway deaths and seriousinjuries. Thus, the agency cannot agree that Congress was unaware of thepotential safety consequences of a downsized fleet of cars. Since then,there has been a significant upgrading of the safety of new cars of allsizes. As a result of a 1984 rulemaking action amending FMVSS 208, at least40 percent of the MY 1989 cars are being equipped with automatic frontalcrash protection (e.g., air bags or automatic belts), and beginning inMY 1990 all new cars will be so equipped. Further, NHTSA has issued proposalsto upgrade the side impact protection of new cars (see 53 FR 2239, January27, 1988, proposing to amend FMVSS 214) and to require rear-seat lap/shoulderbelts in cars and light trucks (see 53 FR 47982, November 29, 1988, proposingto amend FMVSS 208). And there have been voluntary improvements by manufacturerstoo, as evidenced by improving scores on New Car Assessment Program testsand growing availability of safety features such as anti-lock brakes. In sum, the agency agrees with the commenters that the possibility of tradeoffsbetween the various types of vehicle performance (fuel economy, safety,emissions, etc.) should be considered in fuel economy rulemaking proceedings.Just as EPA attempts to determine whether the potential adverse fuel economyeffects of its emissions standards can be offset by technological means,NHTSA considers the extent to which there might be adverse effects on safetyof a CAFE standard that forced manufacturers to do substantial additionaldownsizing and the extent to which those effects might be offset throughdesign changes. Since GM and Ford have stated that they are unlikely toalter their product plans or reduce vehicle weight in response to a decisionto retain the 27.5 mpg standard, the agency concludes that there will notbe any adverse safety consequences associated with this decision. Consistentwith its past regulatory practices, the agency would carefully evaluatewhether there would be any such adverse effects in future CAFE rulemakings.III-D. Potential Impacts of Retaining the 27.5 mpg Standard on Energy ConservationAs NHTSA recognized in the rulemakings for MY 1986-89, a single year decisionto either retain the 27.5 mpg statutory standard or to make a slight reductionin that standard will, at most, have a small, unquantifiable impact onenergy conservation. NHTSA notes the following additional points with respectto MY 1990. First, manufacturers have long since completed their productplans for MY 1990 and do not have time to make any significant technologicalchanges that would either increase or decrease fuel economy. Second, therange of standards proposed by NHTSA, 26.5 mpg to 27.5 mpg, was narrow.Third, the decision for MY 1990 covers only one model year. Fourth, giventheir credit banks, both GM and Ford can easily comply with the MY 1990standard of 27.5 mpg by use of carryforward credits, i.e., ones that havealready been earned. While the recent decisions to slightly reduce the statutory standard havenot had a quantifiable impact on energy conservation, NHTSA recognizesthat the impacts of reductions could become significant if the reductionshad continued for a large enough number of model years. Similarly, NHTSAbelieves that the potential actual impacts on energy conservation thatresult from a decision to retain the 27.5 mpg statutory standard for MY1990 are largely related to multi-year considerations. If NHTSA retainsthe statutory standard for MY 1990, the MY 1988 credits used by GM or Fordfor MY 1990 would not be available for MY 1991, although there would besome credits available to be carried forward to that model year. Conversely,a decision to reduce the MY 1990 standard would result in larger creditbanks for GM and Ford. As discussed above, the agency believes that the actual impact on mostEuropean manufacturers of retaining the 27.5 mpg standard would be thepaying of penalties. A reduced standard, in the 26.5 to 27.5 mpg range,would also result in payment of penalties, but to a lesser degree. Thepenalties provide at least some incentive for those manufacturers to makefurther improvements in fuel economy. The decision should have little,if any, impact on Asian manufacturers, which substantially exceed the 27.5mpg standard.Some commenters stated that retention of the 27.5 mpg statutory standardfor MY 1990 would not result in any energy conservation benefits on thebasis that if higher standards require GM and Ford to limit productionof large cars and engines, consumers will find other ways to meet theirneeds. For example, consumers might keep their existing large cars longeror purchase a large truck or large imported car. NHTSA believes that twopoints should be made about this argument. First, both GM and Ford willhave sufficient credits to offset projected MY 1990 shortfalls withoutlimiting production of large cars and engines. Second, the 27.5 mpg statutorystandard was never intended to require product restrictions. The standardwas set years in advance by Congress for the purpose of creating an incentivefor manufacturers to increase their fuel economy by technological means.III-E. Rationale for Decision In establishing the fuel economy regulatory program, Congress had one basicpurpose: reducing U.S. consumption of petroleum by automobiles. Congressrecognized the need for flexibility in achieving that purpose, however,and sought to provide that flexibility in a number of ways. These includeapproximately a decade of leadtime for the 27.5 mpg statutory standard,the averaging approach inherent in CAFE standards, the credit provisions,and NHTSA's amendment authority. For the past four years, NHTSA has exercised its authority to reduce the27.5 mpg standard, consistent with the flexibility provided by Congress.The records for those rulemakings demonstrated that while GM and Ford,constituting a substantial share of the industry had made plans to achievethe 27.5 mpg standard for those model years, those plans had been overtakenby unforeseen events. In particular, while gasoline prices had been expectedto rise throughout the 1980's. they instead fell dramatically. Between198l and 1985, real gasoline prices dropped a total of 25 percent, from$1.76 per gallon to $1.31 (1988 dollars). During 1986, gasoline pricesunexpectedly dropped another 24 percent. to $0.99 (1988 dollars), and haveremained at a low level. With lower gasoline prices, consumer demand differedfrom that expected by GM and Ford in developing their MY 1986-89 productplans, with consumers demanding larger and more powerful cars. While NHTSA reduced the statutory standards for MY 1986-89, it also emphasizedthat manufacturers had a continuing obligation to attempt to meet the 27.5mpg standard for future model years. The agency also emphasized that ifa particular product plan becomes infeasible, manufacturers must pursueadditional compliance plans to the extent possible within available time.NHTSA is now faced with the decision of whether it should exercise itsdiscretion to reduce the 27.5 mpg statutory standard for a fifth consecutiveyear. After carefully considering the comments and other available information,NHTSA has decided not to reduce the statutory standard. There are severalreasons for this decision, some of which have been discussed in greaterdetail above. First, in light of the increasing need for energy conservation, discussedat length above, NHTSA does not believe that the statutory standard shouldbe reduced absent very strong reasons to do so. In 1985, when NHTSA firstbegan reducing the statutory standard, the agency was strongly influencedby the fact that, at least in the near term, there appeared to be a lessenedneed to conserve energy from a national security and energy independencestandpoint. Both the overall import share of the nation's oil supply andthe share from OPEC were substantially below the levels when Congress enactedEPCA. But in just the past four years, those two shares have now risento levels similar to those of 1975 and are continuing to rise. This increasein imports is reason enough by itself to conclude that the need to conserveenergy is significantly increasing. While the existence of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the absenceof petroleum price controls strengthen the nation's energy position ascompared to 1975, and the fuel efficiency of the new-car fleet has improvedsubstantially, it is nonetheless clear that the nation's overall need toconserve energy_and specifically, to control petroleum imports and consumption_issubstantial, and again on the rise. Moreover, forecasts by EIA regardingpetroleum consumption, supplies and imports, and information from EPA andothers, indicate that this trend is likely to continue. Second, the manufacturers have now been on notice for several years thatthey need to develop compliance plans that compensate for the effects oflow gasoline prices. While both the drop in gasoline prices during theearly 1980's and the second drop during 1986 were unanticipated and initiallyexpected to be temporary, the extended period of low gasoline prices duringthe 1980's has made it clear that gasoline prices may remain low over thelonger term. Since low gasoline prices contribute to greater consumer demandfor larger cars and engines, this has made it more difficult for some manufacturersto meet higher CAFE standards. The agency recognized this difficulty andprovided relief from the 27.5 mpg standard for several years. However,as the agency has previously noted, manufacturers need to find (and havea statutory duty to strive for) practicable ways of offsetting the effectsof that demand. Under the circumstances, however, the agency need not reachthe issue of whether either GM or Ford made ``reasonable efforts'' to complywith the statutory standard. In other words, even if it could be determinedthat GM and/or Ford had made ``reasonable efforts'' to achieve a 27.5 mpgCAFE in MY 1990, this alone would not justify reducing the statutory standard.NHTSA does not believe that the record, on balance, warrants reductionin the MY 1990 statutory standard. As discussed above, retention of theMY 1990 27.5 mpg standard need not result in any adverse impacts (e.g.,product restrictions or reduced vehicle sales) for GM or Ford, since thosemanufacturers have already earned more than sufficient carryforward creditsto offset expected shortfalls. The use of those credits will prevent thevarious adverse impacts on GM and Ford, and their employees, that werecited by commenters. Where one part of the statutory scheme (i.e., credits)provides sufficient flexibility, it is less appropriate for the agencyto exercise its discretion to provide the same flexibility by another means(i.e., standard-setting). NHTSA also is not persuaded that the potential impacts on several limited-lineEuropean manufacturers constitute sufficient cause, especially under presentcircumstances, for the agency to reduce the standard. The statutory schemechosen by Congress involves a single standard for all manufacturers otherthan certain low volume manufacturers. In previous rulemaking notices,in the context of setting CAFE standards, NHTSA has concluded that settingthe standards at the level achievable by the least capable of the manufacturers(or group of manufacturers) with a substantial share of the market, insteadof the  lower CAFE levels of limited line manufacturers of larger, luxurycars, is most consistent with the goals of EPCA. See 53 FR 39298-99, October6, 1988. NHTSA believes that this same approach is appropriate with respectto a decision whether to exercise its discretion to reduce the statutory27.5 mpg standard. The combined market share of the approximately nine limited-line Europeanmanufacturers which cannot meet the 27.5 mpg statutory standard is about3.5 percent of all cars sold in this country. As discussed in the MY 1989final rule, setting the standards at the capabilities of some of thesemanufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz, would vitiate the fuel economy programand require NHTSA to disregard Congress' judgment regarding CAFE standards.While the 27.5 mpg standard is above the capabilities of those nine Europeanmanufacturers, a 26.5 mpg standard is still above the capabilities of eightof those manufacturers. The one manufacturer (Saab) that could likely meetthe 26.5 mpg standard may have credits available from MY 1988 to offsetpart or all of any shortfall. Thus. regardless of whether the standardremained at the 27.5 mpg level or was reduced to as low as 26.5 mpg, severalEuropean manufacturers would face the two options cited above: (1) Payingthe statutory penalties associated with failure to comply with fuel economystandards, or (2) drastic product actions which, in the case of some, couldrequire radical changes in the mix of cars they import. The actual impacton the European limited-line manufacturers of retaining the 27.5 mpg standardas opposed to reducing the standard to as low as 26.5 mpg would likelybe the number of companies which faced paying penalties, eight or nine,and the amount of the penalties. On a per-car basis, the maximum differencein penalties between a 27.5 mpg standard and a 26.5 mpg standard wouldbe $50. NHTSA does not believe that the impacts on the limited-line European manufacturers,which have a combined 3.5 percent market share, justify reducing the statutory27.5 mpg standard that applies to almost 100 percent of the industry. Sucha reduction would essentially eliminate any role of the fuel economy standardsas an incentive for the industry as a whole to improve fuel economy. Theagency appreciates that the problems of these manufacturers are largelycaused by the market segments they serve. However, since Congress madethe decision to regulate fuel economy by means of a single standard whichapplies to all manufacturers (other than certain low-volume manufacturers),the agency believes that it would be inconsistent with the statute notto take industrywide considerations into account in the manner contemplatedby the statute and its legislative history. With respect to NRDC's comment that the agency should consider raisingthe CAFE standard above 27.5 mpg, NHTSA notes that a CAFE standard above27.5 mpg was not within the scope of the NPRM and that, in any event, thestatute requires that any amendment that has the effect of making a CAFEstandard more stringent must be promulgated at least l8 months prior tothe beginning of the model year to which it applies. MY 1990 begins inthe fall of this year. Since the agency is taking a different action for MY 1990 than it did forMY 1989, despite a number of similarities between the records for the twoyears, it believes that it should highlight the differences in those records.NHTSA views the rulemakings for MY 1986-89 as providing appropriate flexibilityto the manufacturers to account for and adjust to unexpected changes inmarket conditions, especially lower gasoline prices, and time for themto respond to those changes. Throughout these rulemakings, the agency emphasizedthe need for manufacturers to continue to make efforts to comply with thestatutory 27.5 mpg standard for future model years. While the MY 1989 standardrepresented a reduction from the statutory level, it also represented anincrease from the levels established by NHTSA for MY 1986-88. By exercisingits discretion not to amend the MY 1990 standard, the agency is takingthe next step of returning to the long-term statutory level. NHTSA believesthat the record indicates that there is less of a need to provide flexibilityto the manufacturers for MY 1990 than MY 1989, in part because the MY 1989standard itself provided an additional year of flexibility. In addition,MY 1990 is one year later and is one year farther removed from the gasolineprice declines of the early 1980's and 1986. A reduction in the MY 1990standard would also represent an additional year of not retaining the 27.5mpg statutory standard as an incentive to manufacturers to achieve CAFE'sof 27.5 mpg. While NHTSA's decision for MY 1990 in part reflects the current creditbanks of GM and Ford, the agency notes that factor is not the sole reasonfor the agency's decision. Also, the agency again emphasizes that manufacturershave a continuing statutory obligation to meet the 27.5 mpg standard. AsNHTSA observed in the MY 1986 proceeding:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the agency believes that [certain] product plan changes * ** are consistent with statutory criteria, since they reflect changes inwhat is economically practicable, manufacturers continue to have an obligationto make all necessary efforts consistent with those statutory criteriato meet CAFE standards. To the extent that changes in product plans resultin manufacturers not being able to meet a standard, the manufacturers mustpursue additional means consistent with the factors of section 502(e) tomeet the standard. 50 FR 40542, October 4, 1985.</ITAG>The agency made similar statements in the MY 1987-88 and MY 1989 proceedings.The rulemaking record of this and prior CAFE rulemaking proceedings indicatethat while GM and Ford have made considerable improvement in the fuel economyof their passenger cars, there are still a number of fuel-efficiency enhancingmethods that are not fully utilized throughout their fleets. These includefurther use of front-wheel drive; four-speed automatic transmissions; engineimprovements such as four-valve designs, reduced friction, lean-burn fast-burncombustion, and electronic control; reduction of parasitic losses; aerodynamicand rolling resistance reductions; and material substitution. All of thesemethods are partially used by the GM and Ford fleets, as well as by othermanufacturers. NHTSA believes that the domestic manufacturers should beable to improve their fuel economy in the future by these and/or othertechnological means, without outsourcing their larger cars, without furtherdownsizing or mix shifts toward smaller cars, and without sacrificing accelerationor performance. The agency recognizes that such technological changes requireleadtime. However, the manufacturers have been on notice for several yearsthat their plans for complying with the 27.5 mpg standard must be adjustedto take into account the possibility that gasoline prices will remain low.The agency also notes that, as a general matter, in seeking a reductionof a CAFE standard because of an event such as the 1986 drop in fuel prices,meeting the reasonable efforts test becomes increasingly more difficultas time passes, and leadtime increases. This point is implicit in the agency'srulemaking notices concerning the MY 1986-89 standards. While NHTSA has concluded that the 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1990 will notcause adverse impacts on GM or Ford other than reducing their pool of creditswhich can be used after MY 1990 in place of fuel economy improvements,the agency continues to be concerned about the competitive disadvantagesand perverse effects that can result from the current statutory scheme.These include, among others, the relative benefit enjoyed by most Japaneseand other Asian manufacturers under the law by virtue of their sales mixalone, and the lack of corresponding incentive for those companies to improvetheir fuel economy; and the perverse incentive for the domestic manufacturersto shift the production of their larger, less fuel-efficient cars abroad,so that those cars can be averaged together with their small imports. Fora fuller discussion of these disadvantages and effects, see the final rulereducing the MY 19B9 standard. The Department of Transportation plans totake account of these concerns in developing a legislative strategy concerningthe future of the fuel economy program. As discussed above, several commenters raised various environmental issuesrelating to the effect of a reduction of the 27.5 mpg standard on the amountof gasoline consumed, and thus on energy conservation and on impacts onthe environment. Because NHTSA is not amending the statutory 27.5 mpg standardfor MY 1990, it is not taking any major Federal action that will have asignificant impact on the quality of the human environment. However, NHTSAhas decided to undertake a comprehensive, programmatic Environmental ImpactStatement to examine any potential environmental impacts related to possiblefuture agency actions in the CAFE program.<ITAG tagnum="20">(15 U.S.C. 2002; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on May 16, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey R.
