Long prized as a magnet for attracting industry campaigncontributions, a seat on the Banking Committee has turnedinto a nasty political liability to be avoided if at allpossible. That's a major reason why it now seems likely thatabout one-third of the 51 lawmakers on the panel at the endof the last Congress won't be on it this year.</LP><TEXT>   That's an extraordinary turnover for a House committee,and one that could have a major impact on the panel's workthis year. Among other things, observers say, it could makeit tougher for the administration to sell Congress on broad,complex legislation to overhaul the deposit-insurance fundsand restructure the entire financial-regulation system.   &quot;The Banking Committee is more important now than it'sever been,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), one of thepanel's senior members who is likely to exert even greaterinfluence in the vacuum. &quot;It's really a loss to be losing somany good members now.&quot;   Those who are departing voluntarily -- as opposed to thosewho retired or lost re-election races -- deny they arerunning away from a crisis. Rather, they insist they aresimply taking other, more desirable committee assignments.&quot;If it wasn't for {getting a seat on} Energy and Commerce, Iwould have stayed there,&quot; insists California Democrat RichardLehman.   At the same time, however, he and others acknowledge anumber of frustrations with serving on the committee. One ishaving to deal with the panel's combative and sometimesirascible chairman, Democrat Henry Gonzalez of Texas.   &quot;Henry can be difficult to work with,&quot; says Mr. Lehman. &quot;Ididn't really have a policy disagreement with him, but therewasn't much communication with other committee members.&quot; Thetwo fought over such issues as a coinage bill that Mr. Lehmansaid should have been debated in his subcommittee, but whichMr. Gonzalez assigned to a different one.   Still another drawback, one that panel members don't liketo discuss publicly, is the political fallout from acceptingcampaign contributions from the banking industry.   Once upon a time, the committee had to add an extra tierof desks to its hearing room in the Rayburn Office Buildingto accommodate members eager to serve on a panel that drewsuch heavy special-interest money. But the savings-and-loanscandal, and particularly the still-unfolding saga of theKeating Five senators, has left such contributionspolitically tainted. One sign that the members now see dangerin the Banking Committee work: It now seems likely that theHouse leadership will actually reduce the size of the panelby three or four seats, after allowing it to grow for years.   The issues the Banking Committee must grapple with thisyear surely aren't appetizing. Congress hasn't even completedorganizing itself yet, and the panel's agenda is alreadycrowded with divisive problems. &quot;It's a no-win year forthem,&quot; says Peggy Miller, a lobbyist for the ConsumerFederation of America. &quot;They can't do things to please theindustry any more, because there is such a strong public eyewatching.&quot;   Members expect a bitter battle later this month over morefunding for the savings-and-loan cleanup; a number oflawmakers who approved a previous doubling of Sandamp;L cleanupfunds say they won't do so again unless the administrationstreamlines and speeds up the messy Sandamp;L work.   The administration also needs legislation to shore up thedwindling reserves of the Bank Insurance Fund, which took yetanother huge hit with the weekend failure of the three bankscontrolled by Bank of New England Corp.: Bank of New England,Connecticut Bank andamp; Trust Co. and Maine National Bank.   Finally, and perhaps most crucially, the administrationwants to overhaul how banks and thrifts are regulated. Itwill seek to grant banks the authority to engage in riskieractivities, including underwriting insurance and securities.   For current and potential committee members, that all addsup to a recipe for political pain. &quot;You sort of have to be amasochist here,&quot; says GOP Rep. Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania,who nonetheless plans to remain on the committee. He says heand fellow Republican Steve Bartlett of Texas developed alittle joke between them, as they watched their colleaguesabandon the trenches of the banking wars. &quot;We're looking fora few good men and women,&quot; he says with mock severity.   So far, few of the lawmakers who have answered the callare likely to bring much comfort to the Bush administration.They include freshman Reps. Maxine Waters of California, aDemocrat who once worked for Jesse Jackson, and BernardSanders, the former Socialist mayor of Burlington, Vt. Mr.Sanders, says a spokesman, wanted a seat on the banking panel&quot;for the same reason everyone else wants off it -- there's acrisis in the banking system.&quot;   Even among holdover members, the Bush administration willface a far more-combative committee than two years ago, whenit pushed through the Sandamp;L cleanup bill. &quot;There will bebroader areas of disagreement,&quot; predicts Rep. Ridge.&quot;I thinkit will be more contentious. It just isn't going to receivethe initial broad bipartisan support that {the Sandamp;L cleanup}did.&quot;   One reason is that for many members, their vote on theexpensive Sandamp;L bailout has proven to be their toughestcampaign issue. That was the case with North Carolina Rep.Stephen Neal, now the committee's third-ranking Democrat. &quot;Iwould rather not have to deal with these problems,&quot; he says.&quot;But we have to.&quot; He can't even consider another assignment:&quot;This is where my seniority is.&quot;   The turmoil on the House banking panel contrasts sharplywith the situation on its Senate counterpart. There, few ifany changes are expected in the makeup of the committee --for the moment anyway. But the committee chairman, DonaldRiegle (D., Mich.), remains under scrutiny by the SenateEthics Committee for his ties to thrift executive CharlesKeating -- as does California Democrat Alan Cranston, who hasalready announced he won't run for re-election next year.   Despite the departures from his committee, Mr. Gonzalez,the House chairman, says he doesn't plan to change his ways.As in the last Congress, he has scheduled hearings before heeven knows who will be on his panel; tomorrow, he will hold ahearing on the the Bank of New England failure.   In fact, he says, he's looking forward to the departuresand the cut in his panel's size. It will make for amore-streamlined panel, he says, and besides, &quot;You're notlosing any members of standing.&quot;   ---                    Farewell to Banking                                                                                                          Members of the House Banking Committee in the 101stCongress who won't be on the committee in the 102nd Congress                                                                                                        MEMBER                      REASON FOR LEAVING                                                                                                        Jim Bunning (R., Ky.)
