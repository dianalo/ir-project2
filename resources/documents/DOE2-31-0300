Municipalsolid waste (MSW) has a nationwide potential of 1.2 to 1.6 quad per year;sewage and related solids would add about 5% to this potential. Biodegradableindustrial waste is a limited and largely rural resource; the availabilityof crop and logging residues as well as manures is severely limited foran urban conversion facility. Energy crops have by far the largest potentialof all biogas resources. The availability of these different resourcesto major cities was assessed, using the concept of a surrounding ruralhinterland. This analysis was performed on metropolitan areas of threedifferent sizes and the percent of urban energy demand that could besatisfied by the community waste facility was quantified. Since mostof the feedstock to a community waste facility will be MSW, an economiccomparison was performed of anaerobic digestion of trash versus massburning, the most likely competing technology. Three possible uses forthe biogas were considered, as well as three possible disposal strategiesfor the digested effluent. A spreadsheet mathematical model of a communitywaste facility is being designed. It includes modules for MSW preprocessing,sewage treatment with water hyacinths, feed input, kinetics calculation,low and high solids anaerobic digestion, gas and digested residue processing,energy balance and levelized gas cost calculation. Various residue processingoptions are considered, including land filling, composting, incineration(without power recovery), combustion with power recovery, gasification,and wet oxidation.</TEXT></DOC>
