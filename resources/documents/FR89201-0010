No comments were received in response to the notices of filing. After further evaluation, the Agency has determined that tolerances shouldbe established for the combined residues of tefluthrin, parent, and itsmetabolite Ia on corn, grain, field and pop, at 0.06 ppm and corn, forageand fodder, field and pop at 0.06 ppm. In January 1989, the Agency issued a conditional registration for tefluthrinwith a final expiration date of July 31, 1993. The registration was madeconditional since certain data were lacking. In order to: (1) Evaluatethe effects of tefluthrin on fish and aquatic organisms, (2) establisha permanent acceptable daily intake (ADI) and, (3) establish a crop rotationinterval, several data requirements must be fulfilled during the periodof conditional registration. Such requirements include an aquatic invertebratelife-cycle test (72-4) which is due by August 1989; a fish life-cycle study(72-5) which must be submitted to the Agency by August 1990; an aquaticresidue monitoring study which must be submitted by March 1991; and a rotationalcrop study, field (165-2) which must be submitted by March 1993. In addition,unfulfilled data requirements in the area of toxicology comprise a 21-dayfeeding study and a 21-day dermal study, both in the rat and both designedto investigate serum electrolytes, including magnesium. These studies mustbe submitted to the Agency by April 1989. Without the results of the 21-dayfeeding study, a permanent ADI cannot be determined. Owing to the lackof these studies, the Agency is establishing the tolerances for this pesticideon corn, grain, field and pop, and corn forage and fodder, field and popwith an expiration date of July 31, 1994, to cover residues expected tobe present during the period of conditional registration. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance includea 12-month oral toxicity study in dogs with a no-observed-effect level(NOEL) of 0.5 mg/kg/day; 24-month rat and mouse chronic feeding/oncogenicitystudies with systemic NOELs of 1.1 mg/kg/day and 3.4 mg/kg/day with nooncogenic effects observed at dose levels up to and including 18.2 mg/kg/dayand 54.4 mg/kg/day, the highest dose levels tested for rats and mice, respectively.In a teratology study with rats at dose levels of 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day,no teratogenic effects were observed in the test animals at dose levelsup to and including 5.0 mg/kg/day, which is the level of significant maternaltoxicity.All of the six genotoxicity studies submitted were negative, includingreverse mutation (Ames), TK locus, bone marrow cytogenetics, and unscheduledDNA synthesis. In the multigeneration study the rats were fed tefluthrin at dietary levelsequivalent to 0.75, 2.5, and 12.50 mg/kg/day during 3 months through premating,pregnancy, lactation, and weaning of two litters per generation for twogenerations. Dams showed lower body weight gains at the highest dose duringpregnancy. At both the mid- and high-dose levels the parents of both generationsdisplayed neurotoxic effects (abnormal gaits). Pup weight at the highestdose was reduced, and litter size was reduced. The provisional acceptable daily intake (PADI), based on a NOEL of 0.75mg/kg/day from a multigeneration reproduction study and a safety factorof 1,000, is 0.00075 mg/kg/body weight (bwt) day. The theoretical maximumresidue contribution from the proposed tolerances is 0.00001 mg/kg/bwt/day:This is equivalent to about 1.4 percent of the PADI. The metabolism of the chemical in plants for this corn use is adequatelyunderstood. An analytical method (gas liquid chromatography with an electroncapture detector) is available for enforcement. Prior to its publicationin the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual</T3>, Vol. II, the enforcement methodologyis being made available in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticideenforcement when requested from:<ITAG tagnum="15">By mail: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section (TS-757C),Field Operations Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office location and telephone number: Rm. 246, CM andplusmin;2, 1921Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-3262.</ITAG>The tolerances established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will be adequateto cover residues in or on corn, grain, field, and pop; and corn forageand fodder, field and pop. There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thisproduct. This pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe tolerances are sought. Based on the above information and data considered, the Agency concludesthat the tolerances would protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerancesare established as set forth below with an expiration date of July 31,1994. After receipt and evaluation of the data required to support theconditional registration of tefluthrin, the Agency will consider establishingpermanent tolerances without an expiration date for residues of tefluthrin.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk(address above). Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate andspecify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the groundsfor the objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must statethe issues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objectionsare legally sufficient to justify the relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612)), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from the tolerance requirements do not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A certification statement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Susan H.
