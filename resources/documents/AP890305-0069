Hundreds of Tibetans demanding freedom from Chinese rule smashedwindows, looted shops, restaurants and hotels and vandalized policecars in the capital of the disputed region, the official Xinhua NewsAgency said.   Xinhua said protesters began the shooting by firing on police.Foreign travelers in Lhasa interviewed by telephone said they sawTibetans throwing stones and looting, but saw no Tibetans withweapons.   They said police used tear gas to try to break up the crowdsbefore opening fire.   The violence came on the first anniversary of anotheranti-Chinese demonstration in which 24 people were reported killed.   It also came five days before the 30th anniversary of a faileduprising against Chinese rule that led to the exile of Tibet'sspiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.   Xinhua, reporting from the Lhasa, said early Monday that onepoliceman and 10 other people were killed in the riots. Among theinjured were 40 policemen and more than 60 rioters.   It said ``separatists'' fired at policemen and ``the police wereforced to fire shots as no other means could stop the rioters.''   The report said the disturbance began at noon when 13 Buddhistmonks and nuns began an illegal parade in the Barkhor marketplacearea of central Lhasa. It said they waved banners and shouted``independence for Tibet.''   They were joined by several hundred people who began throwingstones at a police station in Barkhor, Xinhua said.   About 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EST), about 600 rioters emerged on EastBeijing Street, smashing windows, robbing more than 20 restaurants,hotels and shops.   Xinhua said the rioters made four attacks on government andCommunist Party office buildings, smashed traffic control posts andlights and damaged more than 20 police vehicles.   A Canadian tourist, Roch Berphiaume, 33, of Quebec, said policefirst used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds and fired into theair before aiming their weapons at the crowds.   Berphiaume said that before seeking safety he saw groups ofTibetan women and young men singing. Others threw rocks, he said,and ransacked Chinese-owned stores and restaurants. He did not seeTibetans with guns.   ``There was a lot of firing,'' he said. He said he saw securityforces ``running with machine guns and rifles.'' A stray bullet hithis third floor hotel window, he said.   Berphiaume said the firing stopped around 7 p.m., then resumedabout 30 minutes later when rioting broke out again for about anhour.   No more shooting could be heard Monday morning, he said. ``It'spretty calm now.''   There were no reports of foreigners injured in the clashes,although one Swedish tourist, Ceijo Iskojaanta, said severalforeigners had had their cameras confiscated.   Iskojaanta said he had seen a few demonstrators waving protestbanners, but the protest quickly broke down into stone-throwing. Heestimated the crowd at about 1,000 at its peak.   A Japanese student, Yuichiro Tanaka, said he saw Tibetansdemonstrating in front of the government building across the street.   Tanaka said he saw police beating Tibetan demonstrators.   The riots were the worst since March 5, 1988, when Buddhist monkssparked fighting at the end of a prayer festival that killed 24,according to Western travelers.   At least 14 people died in rioting in September and October 1987.The most recent violent protest occurred Dec. 10, when Chinesesecurity forces killed at least one Buddhist monk and one child.   Armed police have been patrolling the city in a show of force andthe annual prayer festival that touched off last year's disturbancewas canceled this year.   Xinhua said there have been four illegal parades in Lhasa sinceFeb. 13. On Feb. 22, several Buddhist nuns were detained by policeafter staging a demonstration against Chinese rule.   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of it for sevencenturies. Many Tibetans say the Communists usurped control when theRed Army moved into Tibet in 1950, and call for independence undertheir former god-king the Dalai Lama, who now lives in exile inIndia.   The pro-independence uprisings have been led by Buddhist monksloyal to the Dalai Lama. Although China now claims to guaranteereligious freedom in the remote mountain region, devout Buddhists inthis former theocracy hold bitter memories of Communist China's pastefforts to suppress their religion and destroy their places ofworship.</TEXT></DOC>
