 The battle plan has been drawn up in anextraordinary document called the &quot;Third Generation Data Base SystemManifesto&quot;, written by Michael Stonebraker, developer of Ingres.andP;  Themanifesto has been endo rsed by Larry Rowe, Professor of Computer Science atBerkeley University and a fellow Ingres colleague; Bruce Lindsay, architectof IBM's DB2; Jim Gray, author of Tandem's NonStop SQL; Mike Carey (describedas an object-oriented afficionado); Michael Brodie, director of databaseresearch for GTE; Phil Bernstein, director of DEC's Cambridge, MassachusettsDBMS lab; and David Beech, technical advisor within Oracle.andP;  These seniorstatesmen of database management systems have decided that as the 1970s wasthe decade of the first generation, hierarchical database, and the 1980s werethe years of relational database dominance, one thing the 1990s are not goingto be is the era of the object-oriented database.andP;  Rather the thirdgeneration database, nameless at present, will be an extension of relationalmethods.andM;&quot;Persistent C++&quot;andM;The third generation database embraces three philosophical tenets.andP;  The firstof these states that data management, object management and rule or knowledgemanagement must all be addressed in the next generation of databases.andP;  In thedata management stakes Stonebraker says that databases must be able to manage100 transactions per second from 1,000 terminals; as for object managementthey must be able to store non-traditional data elements such as images andarrays; while in terms of rule management they must be able to apply rulesabout the data for integrity constraints and business processes.andP;  Therelational heavyweights have decreed that systems that don't address allthree requirements will win only small niche markets - this is a reference toobject-oriented databases, whose forte is object management, and whichStonebraker andamp; co refer to as &quot;persistent C++&quot;, the vendors themselves beingdescribed as the &quot;O Companies&quot;.andP;  The second tenet of the Manifesto decreesthat non-procedural access and data independence - both features of currentrelational databases - must be retained.andP;  Stonebraker refutes claims by theobject-oriented vendors that computer-aided design users, which comprise thenatural constituency for object- oriented databases (CI No 1,449), do notneed query language.andP;  He argued that managers of the designers using CADapplications want to run queries.andP;  The point here being that if the mightyrelationals decree that SQL is necessary, object-oriented databases writtenin C++, will have to offer SQL, which slows their performance.andP;  The thirdtenet is interoperability: databases must interoperate with distributeddatabase management systems, C programs, Fortran programs, businessapplications like Lotus 1-2- 3, or software engineering tools.andP;  Therefore,database systems should not be bound too tightly with any specific language -are you paying attention &quot;persistent C++&quot; vendors?andM;By Katy RingandM;In addition to these three tenets,the manifesto offers 13 detailedpropositions - the first collection of these refines object and rulemanagement where the big relationals are most vulnerable: according to themanifesto, users can look forward to rich type systems moving beyondcharacter string or integer types to x,y co-ordinate type points (so that adatabase will know, say, the geographical relation between addresses), andfloating point number systems capable of dealing with an array as a data type(useful for records of employees whose salaries vary from month to month asthe database could then manage an array of integers).andP;  Multiple inheritance,the core of object-oriented databases, will appear in relational systems sothat a create statement can be extended to cope with inheriting data fromprevious fields arranged hierarchically.andP;  Functions will be installed on thedatabase, accessed by SQL, enabling code to be shared among applications sothat whole records can be taken as an argument, not merely two integers.andO;Rule management or, as the big relationals call it, referential integrity,will be installed on the database and will be universally applied by thedatabase system.andP;  According to Stonebraker the successful database companieswill be those that meet the propositions laid down in the manifesto and therace to get to the finishing line first is on.andP;  As might be expected he istipping Ingres to win by 1993 or 1994, saying that Oracle and DB2 satisfynone of the manifesto's propositions at the moment, nor do SQL2 or SQL3.andP;  Hestated categorically that successful vendors will overrun the standardsprocess because it is not aggressive enough.andP;  The vendors do have their workcut out, however, since such sweeping changes, implemented via proprietarySQL extensions, mean that they must, for example, rip out the hard- codedtype system in the heart of the database and rewrite it from scratch.andP;  Thechanges that these vendors make in their internal execution engine will lockobject-oriented databases out from accessing relational third gel also storefunctions.andP;  Cognoother unstructured data, two-phase commit support and aclient-server implementation offering data placement anywhere in the network;by year end it wto as the best marketing opportunity since ChrStarBaseHowever, with their sights so firmly trained on companies likeOntologic and Versant Technology, the relational guns have overlookedInterbase Software Corp's database management system marketed by Cognos Incas StarBase.andP;  For Cognos now has an application development environment (CINo 1,436) which already addresses the manifesto's three tenets, and appearsto be closer than any other vendor to meeting to as the best marketingopportunity since Christmas.andP;  Please go for it, Cognos!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
