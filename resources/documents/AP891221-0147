U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin scheduled a new trialo begin Jan. 8 in the criminal case of Keith Jackson, who isaccused of selling cocaine to an undercover agent in Lafayette Parkacross the street from the White House. Jackson, 18, also isaccused of distributing crack at a mall and twice near a highschool.   The transactions allegedly took place starting last April 24 andending Sept. 1 with the sale in Lafayette Park,   ``We the jury cannot agree on any of the charges,'' the 12jurors said in a note to Sporkin after four days of deliberations.   In preparing for Bush's Sept. 5 speech about the war on drugs,White House aides decided to have the president hold up a bag ofcrack and arrangements were made to have a drug purchase near theWhite House.   At Jackson's trial, his attorney, Charles Stow, brought out thata Drug Enforcement Administration agent at the scene of theLafayette Park transaction wore a body microphone that didn't work.   A camerman who was supposed to videotape the deal was unable todo so because he was assaulted by a homeless person, a fact whichelicited laughter from the jurors.   During the courtroom testimony, Sporkin observed that ``this islike a Keystone Kops thing.''   DEA officials have said they had difficulty getting Jackson tocome to Lafayette Park because he didn't know where the White Housewas.   In closing arguments, assistant U.S. attorney Mark Carroll saidStow ``has tried to nit-pick'' and said the four crack sales forwhich Jackson is accused did take place.</TEXT></DOC>
