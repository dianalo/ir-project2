Although the administration has been considering such actions at a lower level for several months, according to one senior official, there still isn't a consensus on what steps, if any, to take against Tehran in response to its continued assaults on shipping in the Persian Gulf.    Some officials worry that any form of trade embargo is difficult to enforce, may hurt the U.S. more than Iran, and could detract from American efforts at the United Nations to arrange an international arms embargo against Iran, which has refused to accept a UN cease-fire in its war with Iraq.    Separately, U.S. officials said China and the Soviet Union have expressed some support for a U.S. proposal to impose a world-wide arms embargo against Iran if a last-ditch effort to negotiate a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war fails. The Chinese and the Soviets, along with other members of the United Nations Security Council, have agreed that U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar should be given a &quot;last chance&quot; to arrange a cease-fire before an attempt is made to impose an embargo, one official said.    Secretary of State George Shultz asked foreign ministers from the Security Council countries to support a resolution that would impose an arms embargo on Iran if it fails to accept a cease-fire. But the Chinese and Soviet representatives said they saw some positive steps by Iran toward accepting a cease-fire, and they urged that the Iranians be given more time, officials said. It is likely that the Security Council countries will allow the secretary general &quot;a couple of weeks&quot; more for diplomatic efforts before pushing for the embargo, a U.S. official said.    Chinese and Soviet representatives, who have balked in the past at the idea of an arms embargo because they are eager to maintain good relations with Iran, voiced some support for a new resolution putting an embargo into effect if the cease-fire efforts fail, the official said.    The administration's discussions about possible economic sanctions were spurred by this week's 98-0 Senate vote to shut off all U.S. imports from Iran. The Senate vote, in turn, was a reaction to the recent sharp rise in U.S. purchases of crude oil from Iran.    There is growing anger that the U.S. and its allies are, in effect, financing Tehran's purchases of weapons to continue the war and its continued mine-laying in defiance of their efforts to protect commercial shipping in the gulf.    &quot;We still don't have a position on (the Senate amendment). . . except to say we are in general agreement with the thrust of it, and the general principles,&quot; said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. &quot;But we do want to make sure we fully understand these other impacts,&quot; he added, reflecting the administration's uncertainty over whether to proceed with economic sanctions.    One problem officials are considering is how to enforce an embargo on oil, which represents by far the bulk of Iranian exports. Oil often is difficult to trace to a particular source, and officials fear that even if the U.S. were to impose an embargo it unknowingly could continue to purchase Iranian crude oil by buying from third countries refined petroleum products made from Iranian crude. One possible solution, according to a U.S. official, would be to require suppliers of refined products to certify that their refineries aren't using Iranian crude.    Some White House officials say they also are concerned that an embargo might end up hurting the U.S. more than Iran. Although a U.S. embargo would pose some difficulties for Tehran, the Iranians probably could find other buyers for their oil. But they could use protests over a U.S. embargo to stall negotiations at the Hague involving claims by American businesses and individuals against the Iranian government.    When Iran released American hostages seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, the U.S. agreed to lift a complete trade embargo it had imposed on Iran. American officials say that the earlier agreement wasn't meant to cover future actions, but they believe Iran might portray it that way.    Nevertheless, advocates of a new embargo argue that the administration is being inconsistent by applying harsh sanctions under emergency executive authority against such nations as Nicaragua, Cuba and Libya but not applying the same standard to Iran. </TEXT></DOC>
