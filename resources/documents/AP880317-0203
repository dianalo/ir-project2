Dole called for U.S. military help for the Nicaraguan Contrarebels, who he said were being ``slaughtered by the hundreds.''   But Jesse Jackson, campaigning in Michigan, said, ``We are beingtold we have to be saved from the Sandinistas. There are noSandinistas in Detroit.''   Jackson also included Vice President George Bush, the GOPpresidential front-runner, in his verbal attack. Commenting one dayafter former White House aide Oliver North and three other men wereindicted for their roles in the Iran-Contra money diversion,Jackson said, ``In a real sense, the mailmen have taken the rap forthe postmaster.''   ``North and the others are fall guys in the process. ... Thisinvestigation must conclude the fact that this is PresidentReagan's policy and the fact that Mr. Bush knew about the scheme,''he said.   Sen. Paul Simon said of the troop deployment, ``I'm skepticallike a lot of my colleagues. I don't know what I can trust from theadministration.''   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis not only criticized theadministration's Central American moves but also laid into Bush forrefusing to break with Reagan over a civil rights bill thepresident vetoed on Wednesday.   Reagan has complained the bill would expand federal power, andhe has offered a substitute. But Dukakis said, ``There's a verybasic principle involved here. That is that institutions whichreceive money from the government should not discriminate.''   Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said the vice president has notpublicly discussed his views of the issue, and he said, ``We're notgoing to respond to Dukakis.''   Dukakis, meanwhile, made the rounds on Capitol Hill on Thursday,picking up the endorsements of several lawmakers _ Sen. BarbaraMikulski of Maryland, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Sen. DonaldRiegle and Rep. Howard Wolpe, both of Michigan.   Pat Robertson, still in the GOP race but apparently making onlya token effort the rest of the way, was hoping to bring in neededcash at a California fund-raiser.   Bush and Dukakis had fund-raising events on their schedules,too, and so did Illinois Democratic primary winner Simon, as thecandidates took advantage of a primary season lull to catch theirbreath and pick up campaign money for the series of big-stateprimaries next month.   Dukakis praised Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk and NewYork Gov. Mario Cuomo for their recent comments against decidingthe party's nominee at a brokered convention _ as Simon has said isinevitable _ and in favor of settling the matter beforehand.Dukakis paraded new endorsements from two senators whose stateshave already voted _ Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Patrick Leahyof Maine _ and sought support from two others _ Bill Bradley of NewJersey and Donald Riegle of Michigan.   The Massachusetts governor also compared himself to former VicePresident Walter Mondale, who lost the general election in alandslide to Reagan after a tough fight to win the nomination in1984.   ``This is a long process,'' Dukakis said of his wins and lossesin primaries so far. ``Mondale in '84 lost a whole string ofprimaries and pulled it out, numerically, with New Jersey. Ifthere's one campaign that's doing it primary by primary, caucus bycaucus, it's this campaign.''   Gephardt was campaigning hard in Michigan ahead of March 26caucuses there. The Missouri congressman, who fell far behindDukakis, Sen. Albert Gore and Simon on Super Tuesday, is travelingthe state in a bus while his 80-year-old mother, Loreen, has beenmaking the rounds of radio talk shows in Detroit.   Gore was on the campaign trail, too, but was having weatherproblems in Kansas, where Democratic caucuses will be held Saturday.   The Tennessee senator, who bypassed the year's lead-off contestsin Iowa and New Hampshire, got a taste Thursday of the cold, snowycampaigning he missed in those states. He greeted workers arrivingat a Boeing plant in Wichita, which had been hit by late-wintersnow. And his next stop in Pittsburg, Kan., was canceled becausethe airport there had no de-icing equipment.   Gore, in a news conference later in Topeka, was less criticalthan several of his Democratic rivals of the Reaganadministration's sending of troops to Honduras. But he did say, ``Ithink it was wrong to mislead the Congress and fail to provide theinformation about what led up to the decision.''   He also said, ``I think the president erred in not virgorouslypursuing'' a peace plan offered by the president of Costa Rica.   Dole, in a speech on the Senate floor, declared that theNicaraguan Contra rebels were being overrun and ``slaughtered bythe hundreds,'' and he said Reagan should immediately resubmit arequest for military aid.   ``Does it make sense, even as thousands of communist troopscross the border of a free country in this hemisphere, for membersof Congress to make excuses for (Nicaragua's) aggression, whileaccusing the president of the United States of fueling the fires ofwar in Central America?'' Dole asked.   Gephardt, however, in a statement released by his office inWashington, strongly criticized Reagan for sending troops toHonduras.   ``Now we have this overreaction that puts American troops inharm's way,'' he said. ``This `exercise' serves no purpose but todraw us into a war that the American people oppose.''   Gephardt said, ``In pursuit of its failed policy of support forthe Contras, the administration has lost its sense of direction,abandoned the rule of law and failed to protect American nationalinterests in a troubled region.''   Dukakis said to reporters in Boston that the decision to sendtroops was ``very regrettable.''</TEXT></DOC>
