That is the grim medical picture painted by a group of Kuwaitiexiles gathering reports about life in their Iraqi-occupied country.   ``There are no medical services except for scattered Kuwaitidoctors running clinics from their homes,'' says Dr. Fawziaal-Sayegh, a pediatrician who used to split her time between Londonand Kuwait.   ``If you have an emergency, you die,'' she said, adding thatIraqi troops control the hospitals and have denied access toKuwaitis.   Information received by the exiles comes from people fleeingKuwait and from short-wave or satellite radio transmissions fromthe country.   The information could not be independently verified because allregular telephone and mail communication has been cut off by theestimated 170,000 Iraqi troops who have occupied the country in thewake of the Aug. 2 invasion.   Up to 1 million people are estimated trapped in Kuwait.   The exiles, some of them members of Kuwait's ruling al-Sabahclan, relayed chilling tales of food shortages, killings, andhospital patients dying after being deprived of life-sustainingequipment.   Some of the stories deal with medical care, the pride of Kuwaituntil a month ago. Free care used to be given to citizens athospitals boasting some of the most advanced equipment in the world.   Among the claims made by the Kuwaitis, gathered from numerousinterviews as well as from statements by Mohammed Abulhasan,Kuwait's U.N. ambassador:   _Twenty-two premature babies died shortly after the Iraqiinvasion when troops took away their oxygen supplies. Abulhasanmentioned this is a letter to the U.N. Security Council. The deathswere said to occur six days after the invasion.   _Bodies of dead Kuwaitis are being stored in what used to be anice-skating rink, according Sheika Merian Al-Sabah, daughter ofKuwait's crown prince.   _Four cases of cholera, an often fatal disease that breeds inunsanitary conditions, have been reported, Dr. al-Sayegh said.Cholera is transmitted through contaminated food and water.   _Iraqi troops have pillaged five regular hospitals, stealingequipment and transferring plasma deposits from blood banks toBaghdad. The hospitals were emptied of regular patients, some ofwhom died, exiles said.   ``They want to prepare the hospitals for Iraqi war injuries,''Dr. al-Sayegh said.   _Two Kuwaiti and one Egyptian woman were left to care for 130handicapped and mentally disturbed children after the invasion.Many of the former caregivers _ mostly expatriate Asians _ fled thecountry after the invasion, Dr. al-Sayegh said.   _Mental patients were let out of the psychiatric hospital toroam the streets without medication or care. ``They don't know whatis happening. They are sick,'' the pediatrician said. It was herunderstanding that most of the patients have been taken in toprivate homes.   _Ambulances no longer function because Iraqi troops shot out thetires of many vehicles, Dr. al-Sayegh said.</TEXT></DOC>
