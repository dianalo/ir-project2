The report is the latest study into wild price movements blamedfor scaring off small investors. It was written by a blue-ribbonpanel formed after the market plunged last October in a near-repeatof the 1987 crash.   The panel's conclusion that the most popular program tradingstrategy, index arbitrage, is a ``natural feature'' in stock andstock-index futures markets is likely to reignite a simmeringdebate.   The NYSE group was composed primarily of representatives of WallStreet, large corporations and big insitutional money managers _which largely have opposed placing restrictions on program trading.   ``It's simply an affirmation of the fact that the NYSE hassurrendered all of their hopes and dreams to the institutions,''said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel Corp. and a programtrading opponent.   In its main proposal, the panel supported coordinated ``circuitbreakers'' in the cash, futures and options markets that would stoptrading during wide market fluctuations.   The system would place a 400-point cap on the possible dailyrise or fall in the Dow Jones industrial average and allow for thestock market to close for nearly a full day in the case of rapidprice movements. The average plummeted 508 points in the recordcrash of Oct. 19, 1987.   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith, who led the 19-memberpanel, said the circuit breakers would provide ``a breathing spellin the market'' in chaotic times.   The panel proposed halting trading for one hour if the Dow Jonesaverage moves up or down 100 points from the previous day's close;another 90 minutes if it moves 200 points; and two hours each if itmoves 300 points and 400 points. Stoppages would be coordinatedwith the nation's futures markets.   But opponents have said such a measure, a less restrictive formof which already exists, would limit individual investors' abilityto get out of the market during a downturn. There were no circuitbreakers in effect at the time of the 1987 crash.   The Big Board panel took the view that index arbitrage and otherforms of program trading are here to stay. Index arbitrage involvesrapid trading of stocks in New York and stock-index futures inChicago to profit from momentary price discrepancies between thetwo markets.   Critics blamed the practice for worsening the market's freefallduring the 1987 crash and again last Oct. 13, when the Dow Jonesindustrial average fell 190 points. Many large Wall Streetbrokerages pulled back on program trading after last year'smini-crash, but their customers did not.   In February, the NYSE proposed restricting stock-index arbitragewhen the Dow Jones average is up or down 50 points or more. Thatproposal still is pending before the Securities and ExchangeCommission and wasn't affected by the new report.   At the time, the NYSE said program trading strategies ``maycreate excess volatility that undermines investor confidence in thefairness and orderliness of the securities markets, and may in factconstitute a threat to the viability of America's capital markets.''   But the blue-ribbon panel report, endorsed by NYSE Chairman JohnJ. Phelan Jr., concludes that ``there is little evidence that indexarbitrage causes an increase in volatility as usually measured.''   The closest the report comes to criticizing the practice is astatement that ``it is possible that program trading and indexarbitrage exacerbate short-term volatility.''   The panel also called for creating a single agency to regulatethe nation's stock and stock-index futures markets. That findingrankled the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which would be likely tolose authority under a super-regulator, and is sure to deepen thedebate.   The Bush administration already has endorsed legislation thatwould give the Securities and Exchange Commission control over themarkets.   SEC Chairman Richard S. Breeden said he was ``extremelypleased'' with the NYSE panel's recommendation. He said it ``inessence fully confirms'' the proposed legislation.   But Chicago Merc Chairman Leo Melamed, a panel member, attacheda dissent to the report. ``A majority of the panel simply mirroreda popular perception that consolidation of regulation seemsdesirable,'' it said.   Some of the conclusions in the latest report overlap findings inmore than a dozen studies undertaken following the 1987 crash,including the government's Brady Commission report that endorsedcircuit breakers. The Brady Commission, however, placed more blameon program trading as a source of volatility.   Phelan said the report would be voted on by the exchange's boardand its recommendations discussed with other financial markets.</TEXT></DOC>
