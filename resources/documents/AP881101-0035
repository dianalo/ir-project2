President Daniel Ortega on Monday extended the 7-month-oldcease-fire ``with the objective of enabling Contra (rebel) groupsto put down their arms, take advantage of the amnesty and enter thenormal life of the country,'' according to a statement released byhis office.   The cease-fire, yet another unilateral extension of a 30-dayformal truce that took effect April 1, would have expired Nov. 1.   The rebels have said the cease-fire is indefinite.   The Sandinistas and rebels agreed on March 21 to halt offensivemilitary operations. Two days later, they signed a pact tonegotiate a lasting peace in the 8-year civil war.   But talks on a definitive cease-fire stalemated in September.Each side has accused the other of violating the truce.   The government newspaper Barricada on Monday urged Nicaraguansto prepare for a U.S. invasion.   Under the headline ``Rising Threat,'' an editorial said Hondurantroops on Sunday harassed a Nicaraguan border village and accusedHonduras of what it called a recent series of cross-border attacks.   The government claims the attacks are part of U.S. plan toprovoke a border war with Honduras and American troops then wouldinvade to back Honduras.   Most Contra fighters are at base camps just across the border insouthern Honduras.</TEXT></DOC>
