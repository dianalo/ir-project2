Members of President F.W. de Klerk's cabinet say he isbound by a campaign promise to allow whites, who make up lessthan 15% of the population, to kill proposals that could leadto majority rule.</LP><TEXT>   This issue looms as a major stumbling block in thenegotiations between the government and anti-apartheidorganizations. The African National Congress, the country'sprimary pro-democracy force, rejects what is called the&quot;white veto.&quot;   The ANC and the government are leaders of the Conventionfor a Democratic South Africa, or Codesa, a continuing,multiparty negotiating process that will establish guidelinesfor writing a new constitution. Drafting of the documentcould begin later this year.   Mr. de Klerk has said that all South African adults,including blacks who currently are excluded by apartheid lawfrom the electorate, could vote on a new constitution. Butthe votes would be counted separately by race. Rejection bywhites would mean the process would have to start over, inthe government's view.   &quot;I believe we will get the {white} majority and if wedon't we'll be in trouble,&quot; Foreign Minister Roelof &quot;Pik&quot;Botha told reporters. White rejection of a new constitutionwould mean &quot;the majority of whites have a death wish and areprepared to destroy themselves,&quot; he added.   Given that whites now hold political power in SouthAfrica, a referendum with racially counted votes is necessary&quot;in terms of political realism,&quot; said Gerrit Viljoen,minister of constitutional development. Mr. Viljoen believesa &quot;demonstration of public acceptance&quot; would diffuseopposition to the development of a nonracial South Africafrom right-wing supporters of apartheid.   After a racially based referendum approved a newconstitution, it would still have to be adopted byparliament, which now excludes the black majority. &quot;I alsowish to emphasize,&quot; Mr. de Klerk said as he opened thecurrent session of parliament on Friday, &quot;that onlyparliament as constituted at present has the power to amendthe present constitution.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
