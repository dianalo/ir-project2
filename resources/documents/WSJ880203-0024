Winter </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CMZ CTCO LIT MMO GLE </CO><IN> IND STK HRD </IN><TEXT>   The outlook for machine tool builders is brightening, but not fast enough to make the stocks attractive to some analysts who follow the badly battered industry.    &quot;It's not that the industry hasn't hit bottom -- it probably has and will improve in 1988,&quot; says Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber. &quot;But the market valuation already assumes the benefits to be gained from the lower-valued dollar.&quot; That leaves risks if the economy in 1988 and 1989 isn't as good as expected, he says.    Machine tools include lathes, machining centers and metal-forming presses that are used to shape most metal parts. They are highly sophisticated devices, often with computerized controls. Periodically over the past two decades, machine tool stocks have come into vogue as high-tech investments expected to pay off as the U.S. automates to meet foreign competition.    However, with several leading machine tool makers incurring losses, the stocks currently are far from glamorous. Cincinnati Milacron, Cross andamp; Trecker, Monarch Machine Tool and Gleason Corp. stocks all collapsed to below half their 1987 highs following the Oct. 19 crash. They have recovered less than half of the lost ground.    Tool builders are beginning to benefit from the dollar's decline. The U.S. industry's worst problem over the past five years has been a deluge of imported machine tools, particularly from Japan. The National Machine Tool Builders' Association estimates that foreign-made machines captured nearly half the U.S. market last year, double their share five years earlier. What's more, overall U.S. demand for machine tools was weak, because of a downturn in many manufacturing industries.    The dollar's decline is changing that -- but not overnight. Export orders of U.S. machine tool plants in the 1987 fourth quarter jumped 44% from the dismal level of a year earlier. Japanese producers finally are raising prices in the U.S. on some machines, but they remain tough competitors.    In addition, contends Richard T. Lindgren, Cross andamp; Trecker's president and chief executive officer, &quot;The U.S. is definitely back at the top of the list as a place to manufacture, which improves the domestic machine tool outlook.&quot;    For those reasons, analyst Ron Petrie of McDonald andamp; Co. recently recommended Cross andamp; Trecker and Milacron, the industry's largest producers. &quot;Companies will be increasing or upgrading capacity to meet demand,&quot; he says. Also, although auto sales are weak, car makers and their suppliers will buy more machine tools this year than in 1987 to make engines and drive trains for 1990 models, he notes. And, he adds, foreign tool penetration will be declining.    Christine Chien, who follows the machine tool industry for Prudential-Bache Securities, is waiting for those fundamentals to produce higher orders before recommending the stocks. &quot;The economic signs are favorable, but the industry really hasn't turned yet,&quot; she maintains.    Domestic orders placed with U.S. machine tool plants last year totaled $1.83 billion, down 2.7% from an already puny $1.88 billion in 1986, the industry's trade group says. Domestic orders in the fourth quarter climbed to a $2.24 billion annual pace because of several large auto company bookings. But it's unclear whether that order rate will be sustained.    The Japanese continue to export aggressively in spite of higher production costs when translated into dollars. &quot;Voluntary restraint agreements&quot; limiting machine tool exports to the U.S. -- negotiated after intense industry lobbying -- have had little effect so far, partly because U.S. inventories of foreign-made machines were large when the limits took effect early last year.    In addition, Mr. Lustgarten says nine foreign machine tool producers have opened or are about to open plants in the U.S. While domestic builders may enjoy a brief respite from foreign competition in the next year or so, he says, those transplant facilities will eventually reclaim much of the U.S. market share that their foreign-based parents lost.    Mr. Lustgarten sees another risk with Milacron. He's recommending sale of the stock because he thinks directors in mid-February may reduce the dividend, currently 18 cents quarterly.    But, says Mr. Petrie, &quot;The Milacron dividend has been paid through far worse conditions.&quot; In fact, he's hopeful that Cross andamp; Trecker will reinstate its dividend late this year. Cross andamp; Trecker, which has posted losses, halted its 20-cent quarterly dividend more than a year ago.    Cross andamp; Trecker may have another problem. Its Cross Co. unit has lost several large automotive orders to Ingersoll Milling Machine Co., a closely held Rockford, Ill., concern, and Lamb Technicon Corp., which was acquired last year by Litton Industries Inc. Cross has won major orders for these high-volume production lines in Europe but hasn't fared well in Detroit. Some analysts say Cross may merely have been more prudent, refusing to reach for marginal or unprofitable business.    Mr. Lindgren says Cross andamp; Trecker has cut costs, introduced new machines and strengthened its competitive position enough to &quot;operate profitably whether or not the market (for machine tools) improves.&quot; The company had a $24.5 million loss for the year ended last Sept. 30, including $9.7 million in after-tax restructuring charges and a $4.4 million loss from a discontinued grinding machine business. </TEXT></DOC>
