(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker will pleadinnocent Tuesday to all charges in indictments accusing him ofdiverting millions of dollars of his followers' money to his ownuse, an attorney said Monday.   ``Mr. Bakker will have a long prepared statement'' followingarraignment, said Harold Bender, one of Bakker's attorneys.   Bakker did not mention his court date on Monday's ``Jim and TammyShow,'' which the couple tapes at their leased home just south ofCharlotte.   The Bakkers recently returned to television after nearly twoyears off the air. During that time, Bakker was forced from hisministry when it was disclosed that he had had a sexual liaison witha church secretary and then paid her to remain quiet.   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the PTL televisionministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted on Dec. 5 after a16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation underBakker's leadership.   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy at PTL,each were charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud andconspiracy. They were accused of conspiring to defraud PTLcontributors and of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money fortheir personal use.   Last week, Dortch waived his right to appear at Tuesday'sarraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor is expected to set a trial date atthe hearing. Bender said he's heard speculation that Dortch may seeka separate trial.   ``Otherwise, he'll bear the burden of all of the pre-trialpublicity Mr. Bakker is getting in the case,'' Bender said.   Also indicted last month were David and James Taggart. Thebrothers entered innocent pleas to charges of tax evasion andconspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection at a Dec. 15 hearingbefore Taylor, who scheduled their trial for the U.S. DistrictCourt's February term.   David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and James Taggart,PTL's former interior decorator, were accused in a separateindictment Dec. 5 of using more than $1.1 million of PTL funds forpersonal expenses.   Taylor released Bakker and the other three defendants on $50,000unsecured bond on Dec. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
