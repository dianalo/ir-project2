The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses Christopher P.Drogoul, former manager of the Atlanta office, and Paul Von Wedel,a suspended vice president at the office, of concealing thetransactions and causing the bank several million dollars in losses.   BNL, Italy's largest bank, said in the suit that the actualamount of the losses has not been determined, though bank officialspreviously said more than $1.7 billion worth of unauthorizedtransactions were made. The suit does not seek specific damages.   The suit also says others were involved in the alleged scheme,though it does not identify additional participants.   The suit says the alleged activities include racketeering, mailfraud and wire fraud.   John R. Martin, an attorney for Drogoul and Von Wedel, said lateThursday afternoon he had not yet seen the suit but was aware ithad been filed. Martin would not respond to specific charges in thesuit but denied that any actions by the two men caused the bank tolose money.   ``I understand they have charged Drogoul and Von Wedel withunauthorized transactions that have caused the bank a loss,''Martin said. ``Our side is, whatever happened did not harm thebank.''   He said he would file a response to the suit within 20 days.   BNL announced in August it had uncovered transactions by itsAtlanta branch that were neither authorized by the bank's NorthAmerican management nor its Rome headquarters.   The developing scandal has caused shock waves both in the UnitedStates and in Italy, where the bank is 74 percent owned by thenational treasury.   Drogoul was fired in early September, and nine of the 15employees in the Atlanta office later were suspended. In Italy, thegovernment replaced the two top officials of BNL after word of theinvestigation broke.   The suit says the time the alleged activities began has not beendetermined. Drogoul and Von Wedel began working for BNL in 1984.   The suit alleges that the unauthorized credits and loanagreements were made to various commercial banks in Iraq, the IraqiMinistries of Trade, the Central Bank of Iraq and facilities inother countries including the United States.   ``The loan agreements and credit facilities purported toobligate BNL to extend credit ... at interest rates, fees and othercompensation below the prevailing market rates fore such loans,''the suit said.   The defendants ``engaged in a conscious, deliberate andwidespread effort to conceal the existence of the agreements andfacilities and the actions'' to bank officials as well asregulatory agencies, according to the suit.   By doing so, the suit said, the two men violated their duties asofficials of the bank and caused the institution harm that willcontinue into the foreseeable future.</TEXT></DOC>
