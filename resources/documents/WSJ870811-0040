Iraq, at war with Iran, knows that the ayatollah's prime military objective is the head of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. Destabilizing Kuwait-like Iraq, led by members of Islam's Sunni majority -- is evidently another goal of Iran as its seeks to spread its fundamentalist revolution. And following the deadly Mecca riot, Iran has publicly resolved to uproot the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia.    For the nervous leaders of these and other regimes in the Persian Gulf, where 60% of the world's proven oil reserves lie, the example of another neighbor of Iran might be instructive. It is Bahrain.    Bahrain's population is 70% Shiite, a higher proportion than any other Moslem nation outside Iran. Many of its people feel a spiritual tie to the Islamic clerics who reign in Tehran. Iran also is a land to which a considerable number trace their ethnic roots.    And just beneath the horizon of the Persian Gulf waters lie Iran's air bases. &quot;An F-4 from Iran can get here in five minutes,&quot; says the U.S. ambassador, Sam Zakham. In 1981, the ayatollah's intelligence services tried to foment a Bahrainian Shiite coup d'etat.    Yet this tiny emirate hangs tough, resolute in maintaining a relatively liberal society open to the outside world. It has a large community of Western and Japanese bankers and businessmen, who contribute to its prosperity. Its hotels, restaurants and nightclubs offer liquor and shows. And its policies don't appear to be arousing any dangerous resentment among its Shiites.    &quot;Are we going to make it?&quot; asks Ali Fakhrou, a senior member of the Bahraini cabinet, education minister and resident sage. &quot;Yes, because we don't believe in rejectionist Islam. We emphasize to our people the unity of Islam and its compatibility with modern times. It will work because people see our system is good for all.&quot;    Behind this confidence lies a risky but deliberate political and economic policy carried out by a durable leadership. Although no one calls it an anti-fundamentalist scheme, it is.    It rests on three legs: A comprehensive social-welfare system so designed as to create a sense of belonging; a generous level of religious and political freedom for Shiites, coupled with explicit respect for their traditions; and an effective security force that balances firmness with civility to avoid the appearance of a police state.    &quot;Our philosophy is to build a very big middle class through free education, free medical care, subsidized housing and a largely free enterprise system,&quot; says Tarek Almoayed, the minister of information and tourism and a senior adviser to Bahrain's ruler. &quot;The idea is to give the greatest number of Bahrainis a real stake in the stability of this country.&quot;    Nowhere is the benevolent state more evident than in the Bahraini public housing developments known as Issa Town and Hammad Town. Shimmering in the bright sunshine that bathes this 243-square-mile island year round, thousands of neat white houses, their edges colored in pastels of orange, blue, and green, stand out against the stark desert landscape. There are schools, hospitals, mosques, child-care centers and supermarkets. Entrances to the towns are adorned with Arabesque sculptures and gardens.    None of it resembles subsidized housing. The accent is on privacy and plenty of space, features much desired by Arab families. Houses range from four to seven rooms. The architecture is a pleasing Arabic style of arches and domes. Each house has front and back yards and a garage.    Ownership, on generous terms, is accessible to fully 40% of Bahrain's mostly Shiite poor. Basically, a Bahraini man pays 25% of his income, whatever it is, to own a house that is commensurate with the size of his family. Payments are spread out over 25 years. The waiting period is anywhere from one to five years.    &quot;Everyone who needed a house has benefited,&quot; says Abdul Latif Kanoo, the housing undersecretary. &quot;We have achieved our objective. Now we are building for a second generation.&quot;    In a country with a population of only 417,000, Mr. Kanoo estimates that $1.5 billion has been spent on the housing program since it was formalized in 1975. The policy obviously isn't one easily copied by nations without the kind of wealth Bahrain earns from its oil, service and tourist economy. But such wealth isn't lacking in neighboring Moslem regimes threatened by fundamentalist fervor.    Bahrain's housing program predates the Iranian revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini's crusade. After he took over in 1979, Bahrain was quick to recognize that Iran was seeking to exploit the discontent of other Shiite communities, which are minorities in all Arab countries except Bahrain and Iraq. Iranian radio broadcasts in Arabic are addressed to &quot;al Mustazaafin,&quot; a code for oppressed Moslems. Bahrain's Shiites, though, feel less oppressed than most.    In Iraq, leading Shiite religious figures have been jailed, tortured and executed. Saudi Arabia has begun treating its 700,000 or so Shiites in the oil-producing provinces somewhat better lately, but by no means as equals; the Saudis deny the Shiites advancement and the freedom to hold processions and observe other religious rites. In Kuwait, after repeated terrorist acts sponsored by Iran, Shiites are increasingly shunned as a fifth column.    By contrast, Bahrain's ruling family has long sought to impart a message of equality. It is the only Arab government that makes Shiite religious feasts national holidays. Though the highest political offices go to the Emir Sheik Issa bin Salman al-Khalifa and his immediate Sunni Moslem family, which has ruled for two centuries, Bahrain names Shiites to senior government portfolios.    Shiite families can engage freely in trade and commerce, Bahrain's main economic activities. They control some of the country's largest trading companies.    And their voices can be heard. Twice a week, the emir, a diminutive man with lively eyes, a keen sense of humor and a quick mind, holds a majlis, or open house, in his palace. Anyone can come and speak with him.    Bahrain's small size helps greatly here. &quot;This is more like one big family instead of a small country,&quot; says Abdelkarim Ismail, an editor of a weekly paper called Gulf Mirror. &quot;I have access to the government, to the ruler. It makes a difference.&quot;    There is more to the ruler's personality than a kindly smile. &quot;He probably is the shrewdest tactician and smartest ruler of the gulf region,&quot; says Steven Abdulkader, an American who converted to Islam and lives in Bahrain.    A senior Arab ambassador who knows the region intimately says the emir's principal achievement is to have clearly comprehended what he calls the &quot;psychology of the oppressed&quot; that many say marks the Shiite psyche. As a majority ruled by a minority, the Shiites easily detect signs of arrogance or neglect that feed their long-standing persecution complex.    The emir avoids the high-handed behavior that so damaged the shah, who gave the impression he considered Shiite rites, beliefs and traditions embarrassingly backward. The emir &quot;attends every important wedding or burial whether Shiite or Sunni,&quot; says the ambassador. &quot;He is generous with his money. It is hard to pin a corruption charge on him. He doesn't own any obscenely grandiose palaces here or overseas -- the ammunition of fundamentalists. These, after all, are the lessons of Iran.&quot; But the emir didn't adopt such policies only after seeing the shah fall. A Shiite neighborhood leader (who, like all ordinary Bahrainis interviewed, asked not to be identified) relates an example dating to 1969. When people began to move into the Issa Town housing development, the Shiites there installed loudspeakers over their house of prayer, known as a maatam. Sunnis, who are snobbish about such things, complained to the emir about the noise.    The emir responded by granting a piece of land to the Shiites to build an even bigger maatam and inviting the Sunnis to move out. &quot;It cost him little, but it created a bit of a legend, and a rope of amity with the community,&quot; says the Shiite leader.    Along with the carrot, however, goes the stick.    Here it is called the Criminal Investigation Directory, or CID. Housed in a modern complex bristling with antennas in the part of town where mostly expatriates live, it has woven a legend of its own.    It is a large force of plainclothes security police commanded by Col. Ian Henderson, a shadowy British officer who fought against the Mau Mau in Kenya before settling here.    In contrast to the shah's Savak security force, which was brutal and indiscriminate, the CID is subtle and precise. Bahrainis say one doesn't get in trouble with the CID unless one deserves it. Says one Arab ambassador, &quot;When you insult the authorities publicly, they don't care. {But} when you start acting on it, they don't waste time. They aren't very visible, but they are very effective.&quot;    Bahraini officials just smile when asked about the CID. Others say it is a multinational force of Bahrainis, British, Jordanians and Pakistanis to cope with the equally multinational mixture that makes up Bahrain. It is said to number as many as 5,000, which, comments one Western envoy, is like the &quot;FBI at three million strong.&quot;    Nowadays, those most likely to get in trouble are Shiite militants looking to Iran. The CID keeps a sharp eye on any communications with its big neighbor across the gulf. Bahrain has one of the world's most sophisticated phone systems, but there is one country that can't be dialed directly: Iran. Calls to Iran must go by way of an operator -- and, almost certainly, CID eavesdroppers.    Traveling to Iran isn't easy, either: There are no direct flights from Bahrain. Travelers must go through Dubai, and when they return, they are questioned by the CID, often repeatedly.    These policies combine to blunt Iran's propaganda and its emotional appeal to Shiite brethren here. By all accounts, there is only modest opposition to the regime. Sources say 50 to 70 young Bahrainis at most may have joined the ranks of expatriate revolutionary recruits in Iran.    The Shiite community leader guesses there are about 100 political detainees in Bahrain. Amnesty International says it has unconfirmed reports of torture and one death. Such reports don't seem to worry people here, nor to muzzle the free-wheeling political debate.    Even those Shiites who think they should get more from the government aren't overwhelmingly bitter. They agree that their community hasn't been swept by admiration for the Ayatollah Khomeini's regime. A constantly rising living standard has kept such sentiments under control.    &quot;At first, from 1979 to 1982, there was much enthusiasm for Khomeini in the community,&quot; says the local Shiite leader. &quot;But after the {Iraq-Iran} war dragged on, and after the bloody practices and economic chaos there, feelings are mixed. Many think they are better off here the way things are.&quot;    ---   Shiite Moslems in the Gulf                           PERCENTAGE                        OF POPULATION Iran                             92% Bahrain                          70 Iraq                             60 Kuwait                           24 U.A.E.                           18 Qatar                            16 Saudi Arabia                      8 Oman                              4   Source: James A.
