The Palestine Liberation Organization offensive to oust AbuNidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council from south Lebanon spread toareas around Sidon, a coastal city about 25 miles south of Beirut.   Police report at least 163 people have been wounded since thelatest battles began Friday.   Abu Nidal's spokesman, Walid Khaled, said in a statement fromBeirut that the group was ``ready to accept a cease-fire.'' PrimeMinister Salim Hoss and leaders of Moslem factions also urged for ahalt to the fighting.   But loyalists of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat ignored the pleasand raided houses where Abu Nidal's men were believed to be hiding.Mortar shells and rocket-propelled grenades exploded on othersuspected Abu Nidal strongholds.   Police said shells fell at the rate of 20 a minute during someperiods.   An estimated 100 Abu Nidal guerrillas were entrenched in theirlast bastion about five miles east of Sidon.   Also, pockets of Abu Nidal gunmen were still holding out inseveral parts of the sprawling Ein el-Hilweh shantytown, where anestimated 32,000 refugees live.   PLO officers with bullhorns called on the rivals to, ``Surrenderor die. There's no way out. Surrender if you want to survive.''   The response was volleys of automatic weapons fire.   ``Abu Nidal's men are putting up tough resistance in the fewplaces they still hold in the camp,'' said a police spokesman, whocannot be identified under briefing regulations.   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away fromthe PLO in 1973 and was sentenced to death in absentia by a PLOtribunal for killing Arafat aides.   He has been based in Iraq, Syria and Libya. His currentheadquarters are near Tripoli, Libya's capital.   Abu Nidal is sought by the United States and some WesternEuropean nations for terrorist attacks over the last 15 years,including massacres at Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985that killed at total of 20 people.   He is also wanted in connection with the hijacking of a PanAmerican World Airways jet in Karachi, Pakistan, in September 1986.In that operation, 20 passengers were killed and 120 wounded.   Security sources say Abu Nidal's faction has increasingly beenallied with the Syrians, which has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon.   Arafat, with about 5,000 guerrillas in south Lebanon, is seekingundisputed control over the Sidon region and ordered his forces toeliminate Abu Nidal loyalists.   In June, Arafat's guerrillas crushed a 200-man Abu Nidal forcein the Rashadiyeh refugee camp near Tyre, about 50 miles south ofSidon.</TEXT></DOC>
