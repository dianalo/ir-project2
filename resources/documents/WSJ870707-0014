The plan to tax premiums caught insurance companies by surprise. But trade associations, in letters and radio ads, are urging customers to call Texas legislators to lobby against the tax. &quot;We think there's going to be a groundswell against this,&quot; said Jerry Johns, president of Southwestern Insurance Information Services Inc., an insurance group based here.    The proposal to extend the state's sales tax to insurance premiums is part of a revenue-raising package passed by the Texas House late last week. Texas Senate hearings on the plan are scheduled to begin today.    Legislators have turned to the insurance tax after dropping a more complex proposal to tax most services. The service tax would have brought in about $2 billion in the next two-year budget cycle, which begins Sept. 1. The House has passed a $38.4 billion budget, which will require $5.7 billion in new taxes if the state is to meet its constitutional mandate for a balanced budget.    The insurance industry argues that the tax is particularly unfair because insurance companies already pay a state tax of 1.1% to 3.5% on the total dollar amount of premiums that they collect.    Under the bill passed by the House, the state sales tax would be increased to 6% from 5.25%, and a 5-cent-a-gallon temporary tax on gasoline would be made permanent. The 6% sales tax wouldn't apply to insurance bought by people over 65 years old, Medicare benefits, and insurance bought by local governments and school districts.    The bill's fate is hard to handicap. Texas has traditionally shied away from new taxes such as a personal or corporate income tax. Gov. Bill Clements has vowed to veto any tax that brings in more revenues than the current tax system does, even though budget bills passed by both the House and Senate would require tax increases in order to keep the budget balanced. </TEXT></DOC>
