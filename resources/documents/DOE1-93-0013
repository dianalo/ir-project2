The scheme uses fin and tubetype evacuated tube collectors having a total effective absorption areaof 50 m{sup 2} supplying water directly to a 2500 litre pre-heat storagetankWater is taken from the storage tank to calorifiers where, if necessary,auxiliary heat is supplied to achieve the final use temperature of 60{degree}C.The mean water demand of the system is some 3750 litres/day. The systemhas been in operation since June 1984 and a detailed monitoring exercisewas carried out from September 1984 to June 1986. It was found that thecanteen water demand had a good match to the solar radiation profileand a solar system yearly average efficiency of 38% was achieved. Theassociated solar contribution was around 24% of system demand, againon a yearly average basis. In practical terms the system performed wellexperiencing only minor difficulties. Some 1.6% of the tubes failed dueto loss of vacuum during the life of the project. A comprehensive economicanalysis is presented. This indicates that the present ``retrofit'' systemcannot be considered an economic proposition against existing site energycost. However, energy cost structures on other sites may be more favourable.Also, marked improvements to the unit energy cost emerge if the systemis specified at the early stage of a new building. Non-UK areas, suchas Southern France and Italy, benefit from significantly greater availabilityof solar energy which can have the unit energy costs. 7 refs., 26 figs.,7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
