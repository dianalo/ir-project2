When the Democratic Legislature and GOP GovernorPete Wilson deadlocked on redrawing the state's politicalboundaries, the state Supreme Court gave a panel of retiredjudges the job. Their handiwork is a model of geographiccommon sense that creates a free market in politics in thenation's most populous state.   The current gerrymander was designed by the lateDemocratic Congressman Phil Burton, who called it his&quot;contribution to modern art.&quot; One district was an incredible385-sided figure. Another, which had the jagged and contortedcontours of a Chinese dragon, included a floating &quot;community&quot;of boats in Los Angeles Harbor that was disconnected from therest of the district. The court's new plan smooths out thelines of that district to make it more compact anddemographically coherent.</LP><TEXT>   The &quot;Burtonmander&quot; worked as its creator had hoped. In 225elections for the U.S. House during the 1980s, only fiveraces saw the defeat of an incumbent; three were in theanti-incumbent year of 1990.   The judges charged with redoing Phil Burton's twistedlines first decided that the California Constitution reallymeant something when it required that in drawing districts&quot;the geographical integrity of any city, county or regionshall be respected&quot; wherever possible. Unlike Phil Burton's,the new districts don't resemble splattered inkblots.   The panel also decided that the state needed a healthydose of political competition, and it ignored the desires ofsome incumbents for the kind of safe seats that make merepoliticians start acting like petty barons. The plan is asclose to a level political playing field as one could hopefor. California's 52 House districts -- nearly one out ofeight in the nation -- line up roughly as follows: 19 largelyRepublican seats, 19 largely Democratic seats, four leaningto the GOP, four leaning Democratic and six up for grabs.   The judges' plan proves it's possible to draw districtsthat follow the congressional mandates in the Voting RightsAct (maximize the strength of minorities) and yet not violateprinciples of common sense. The plan protects the state'sfour black House incumbents and creates seven seats withHispanic majorities. But other incumbents have had theirartificial political castles reduced to rubble.   Rep. Henry Waxman, the de facto dictator of much ofAmerica's healthcare policy, will have to run against AnthonyBeilenson, another Democratic Congressman. Rep. Vic Fazio,the chairman of the Democratic Congressional CampaignCommittee, now represents new rural territory, which willrequire that he spend more time on his district's concernsand less on national politics.   Democrats complain that the new district lines have donethe most damage to their incumbents. But given the partisanextremism of the Burton gerrymander, this outcome wasinevitable. Democrats can still elect a majority ofCalifornia's House Members and control the state Legislature,but now they'll really have to compete for it. Even JerryBrown, who in 1982 signed the &quot;Burtonmander&quot; into law in hislast days as Governor, admits that the lines helped make bothCalifornia politics and the state's Democratic Partystagnant.   California's geography-based redistricting stands in sharpcontrast to other states, where state legislators met in backrooms to rejigger the lines. New computer software allowedlegislators in such states as Texas and Virginia to drawtruly serpentine districts. If they decided they liked thedemographics of people on one side of a street more than onthe other they could -- and did -- draw the district linebetween them.   Political analyst Michael Barone, co-author of the widelyused &quot;Almanac of American Politics,&quot; says thatcomputer-driven gerrymandering carries with it the dangerthat districts will no longer represent communities butrather &quot;a mailing list of like-minded people stitchedtogether by geography.&quot;   By restoring the original idea that districts should bedrawn for the convenience of voters and not incumbents,California's Supreme Court has performed a public service.Other states should now follow California's example and takeredistricting out of the hands of a class of self-entrenchingpoliticians who have managed to discredit themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
