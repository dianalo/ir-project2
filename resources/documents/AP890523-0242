McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   The dollar showed just enough weakness early Tuesday to give aboost to gold and silver futures prices on New York's CommodityExchange, but platinum prices retreated as demand for the metalebbs.   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly lower,livestock prices were higher and pork futures mixed, and energyprices climbed.   The dollar continues to exert its influence on precious metals,but in a positive manner as gold and silver prices gained for thefirst time in days.   Gold settled 50 cents to $1.10 higher with the contract fordelivery in June at $364.30 a troy ounce; silver was 6.7 cents to 7cents higher with May at $5.173 a troy ounce.   ``Buying interest reflected a weaker dollar early in the day andindications the administration may want to put a lid on thedollar,'' said Stephen Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter ReynoldsInc. in Chicago. ``The dollar's comeback to be higher on the daytouched off some profit taking.''   Platinum, particularly weak because of pressure from overseasselling, was $8.30 to $9.10 lower with July at $489.20 a troy ounce.   Platt said investors were disappointed the Japanese were notdoing aggressive buying of the metal, primarily used in themanufacture of automobile pollution control devices.   Copper prices were forced lower on the Comex on technicaltrading, as prices broke through several price support levels,triggering additional selling.   News that Comex-approved copper warehouses increased theirstocks by 1,278 tons added to bearish sentiments on the market.   Copper was 1.65 cents to 2.05 cents lower at $1.09 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in subdued tradingon the Chicago Board of Trade as the market continues to beinfluenced by the weather and the strong dollar.   ``Whether the connection with the dollar is real orpsychological, it is having an effect,'' said Rich Feltes, ananalyst with Rifco Inc. in Chicago. ``But the weather continues tohave the most influence on prices.''   The dollar's rally of the past few weeks sparked a selloff ofall commodities Monday, amid concerns overseas sales of grain willbe choked off by the dollar's rise in value.   Wheat settled 3 cents lower to } cent higher with July at $3.95a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with July at $2.65 abushel; oats were a { cent to } cent lower with July at $1.75 abushel; and soybeans were 6 cents lower to 6\ cents higher withJuly at $6.99{ a bushel.   Livestock prices were higher and pork futures were mixed on theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Livestock prices climbed because of the belief the market wasoversold, said Tom Morgan, an analyst for Sterling Research Corp.in Arlington Heights.   Pork futures received some support from Monday's AgricultureDepartment monthly cold storage report that placed on-hand suppliesof frozen pork bellies at 145.3 million pounds.
