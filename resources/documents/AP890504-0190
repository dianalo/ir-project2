KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The jury's verdict against Oliver North onThursday left supporters claiming he had been all but vindicatedand detractors asserting that it reaffirmed the findings of thecongressional Iran-Contra committees that North displayed disdainfor both law and Constitution.   North was described by his defenders as ``absolutely elated''that the jury had acquitted him guilty on nine counts, convictinghim on only three.   Several members of Congress, all Republicans, called onPresident Bush to quickly pardon the former Marine Corps lieutenantcolonel.   Former President Reagan, on whose watch North took the actionsthat resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal and his trial by jury,declined comment. A spokesman said it would not be appropriate forReagan to do so ``because of the likelihood of further legalproceedings.'' President Bush also had no comment on the verdict.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's president pro tem,read off the three guilty verdicts on the chamber's floor, thencongratulated the jury for its diligence.   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, the chairman of the SenateIran-Contra Committee, issued a statement quoting the panel'sfinding that North and the others involved in the Iran-Contraaffair ``showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system ofgovernment.''   The report concluded that: ``They ran a government outside thegovernment. They conducted a secret foreign policy and concealed itthrough a concerted campaign of dishonesty and deception. And whenthe affair began to unravel, they attempted to cover it up withtheir deeds.''   ``The verdict issued today ... reaffirms the conclusions of thecommittee,'' Inouye said.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contracommittee, said he was neither elated nor disappointed at theverdict. ``Col. North had a fair trial ... The system has worked,''he said.   ``I have had a good deal of sympathy for Col. North and theposition he was in,'' Hamilton added. ``The fact that Col. Northwas in a difficult position does not absolve him of hisresponsibility, but it may go toward mitigation of his punishment.''   ``We certainly didn't find out all the truth in the Iran-Contrahearings,'' Hamilton said. ``We'll be learning bits and piecesabout Iran-Contra for years to come, and after the statute oflimitations runs out we'll probably find more.''   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice chairman of the Senate panel,said he believed justice was served in the North verdict.   ``North had to pay a price for his zealotry. ... I found him avery tragic figure. He did some things that in America today youhave to be held accountable for.''   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who used his position as a memberof the Iran-Contra panel to defend President Reagan and North,sharply disagreed.   ``There have been nine acquittals,'' he said. ``If you look atthis objectively, Oliver North has been largely acquitted.''   ``The jury did not think he was as guilty as did the manymembers of Congress who have been ready to hang him,'' Hatch said.   Hatch added: ``I think George Bush should pardon him. Thepresident's problem is that if he does, there will be screaming andshouting by the same partisans.''   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who also served on the Iran-Contracommittee, said he felt ``sorrow, disappointment'' with theverdict, ``but not surprise.''   ``I'm not sure Oliver North got a fair trial. The jury claimedthey never had heard of Iran-Contra but it had consumed all of themedia in Washington. I wonder if it was jury of his peers,'' Hydesaid.   The Illinois Republican said if Reagan, the late CIA directorBill Casey and former national security adviser John Poindexter hadbeen available to assist North, it ``would have been of greathelp.''   ``Colonel North was left twisting in the wind by anadministration he served with all his heart and soul,'' said Hyde,who believes that Reagan should have pardoned North or testified inhis behalf.   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., a member of the Iran-Contracommittee, told reporters: ``I have said from the beginning thatCol. North was acting on orders, expressed or implied. An operationof the magnitude of the Iran-Contra affair is not one that can berun solely by one lieutenant colonel out of the basement of theWhite House without the knowledge of his superiors.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a former judge,said only that ``I respect the jury's verdict in the North case.''   Outside the federal courthouse here, Rep. Robert Dornan,R-Calif., an ardent North supporter, said the former Marine's wife,Betsy, was ``all smiles'' at the verdict.   He said North smiled as the verdict came in, then turned to kisshis wife.   Dornan said North and his wife ``looked like 900 pounds of a1,200-pound weight had been lifted from their backs.''   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a former White House aide forwhom North campaigned last year, described the defendant as``absolutely elated.''   He said that as far as he was concerned the jury found Northguilty ``of only cutting corners and not breaking the law.''   ``I think George Bush should end this travesty and give him apardon,'' said Rohrabacher.   John W. Keker, the lead prosecutor in the case, told reportersNorth was convicted of ``three very serious felony charges.''   ``The principle that no man is above the law has beenvindicated,'' said Keker who refused to answer questions about theverdict.   In a statement, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said, ``Ithas been a well-conducted, hard-fought trial. The rule of law hasbeen discharged.''   But Richard A. Viguerie, chiarman of the United Conservatives ofAmerica, said: ``Oliver North deserves a medal, not a prisonsentence.'' He predicted `` an avalanche of conservative outcry forPresident Bush to pardon Ollie.''   But Arthur J. Kropp, of the liberal People for the American Way,said the central lession of the Iran-Contra episode ``is thatgovernmental deception and excessive secrecy are invitations toscandal.''   ``I hope the events of the past few weeks will lay to rest thequestion of whether Oliver North is ``a national hero.'''</TEXT></DOC>
