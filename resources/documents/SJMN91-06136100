Usually my doctor would recommend bedrest until the pain cleared up, and I'd more or less follow his advice.;   The last time this happened to me, I was visiting my daughter in anotherstate, and she had me see a sports medicine specialist. He said nothing aboutbed rest, but encouraged me to remain active as long as I didn't do anythingto aggravate my back. Has there been a change in the way patients withlower-back pain are being treated?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BED REST NOT ALWAYS BEST FOR THOSE WITH BACKPAIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Health andamp; FitnessFamily PracticeNeil Solomon is a Maryland author and practicing physician with specialexpertise in diet and weight control.  </MEMO><TEXT>     -- C.C., Laurel, Md.; A For some patients, complete bed rest can becounterproductive. Anyone who has ever had to spend several days in bedbecause of an illness knows how weak he or she felt at the end of that time.;   Some patients with severe back pain may have to remain in bed for relief.Others, however, can continue to participate in a number of activities. Forexample, a person who cannot run because of back pain may still be able toswim or walk; this is preferable to simply lying in bed. As the conditionimproves, other activities, eventually including weightlifting, may be added.;   Rather than bed rest, strengthening and stretching back muscles arerecommended. Many physicians now consider bed rest to be an outdated form oftreatment. But patients need to be aware of their symptoms and make thenecessary adjustments so as not to aggravate their condition.;    Q I used tothink of caffeine only in relation to coffee, but as a regular reader of yourcolumn I know that it's found in a lot of other things. Could you give me someidea of the amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee, and then compare it withother products?;    -- Pearl, Rapid City, S.D.; A Five ounces of instantcoffee contain from 50 to 75 milligrams of caffeine. The same amount of dripcoffee contains about twice as much. By comparison, five ounces of hot tea or12 ounces of a cola drink contain about 40 milligrams.;    Over-the-countermedications also contain caffeine. One tablet of NoDoz, which is designed tokeep the user alert, has 100 milligrams, and one tablet of Dexatrim has 200milligrams. Even Excedrin provides as much caffeine in one tablet as in a cupof instant coffee.;    The general recommendation is to limit the daily intakeof caffeine to 200 milligrams. While three to four cups of instant coffeewould keep you within this limit, use of a non-prescription medication couldcause you to exceed it.;    Q If a depressed patient is being treated withdrugs, about how long would it take before family and friends could reasonablyexpect to see some improvement?;    -- Katherine, Hilton Head; Island, S.C.; AIf a depressed patient responds to drug therapy, some improvement should beapparent about 10 days after the start of treatment, with complete improvementpossible after about eight weeks.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Neil Solomon column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910515  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  521  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 15, 199100136100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
