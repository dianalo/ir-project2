In the West, as usual, they rushed the figures straight onto the airwaves and into the press.    Hungary has pollsters, too, and after the summit they ran a snap survey of their own. The figures, as usual, went straight to the Communist Party and stayed there.    &quot;It's like the Gallup Poll,&quot; says a man who helps process questionnaires, &quot;only it's secret here.&quot;    The authorities may let the results out yet. Unlike others in the East Bloc, they often do, though rarely in full, seldom for mass consumption, and never soon. In Hungary, public opinion remains one of officialdom's more private concerns.    Politicians unfettered by free elections, it might seem, have a limited need for opinion polls. But what else, in a country like this, will tell them when a sudden price increase -- or the Soviet line in Reykjavik -- has the public in a snit? Planners unencumbered by a free market might not seem to have much call for market research. But how else will they know when demand for Tomi laundry soap or Swedish disposable diapers falls out of step with supply?    Communists, like kings, have always wanted to know what is on the public mind. In the black days of the 1950s, finding out was largely a job for informers. &quot;They were absolutely paranoic about knowing what the people thought and did,&quot; says Elemer Hankiss, a sociologist at the Academy of Sciences. &quot;But informers didn't give you statistics and percentages.&quot; Pollsters do.    Thanks to them, Hungary's rulers now know that 70% of Hungarians think the Americans already have weapons in space -- and that 60% are sure the Soviets do, too.    The &quot;satisfaction index&quot; tells them that a good income comes fourth on the list of things Hungarians feel are necessary for the good life but 10th on the list of the things they actually have.    And on the roster of public fears, as the rulers must have been happy to learn, a change in regime finishes seventh in seriousness (after things like rampant alcoholism, inflation and the spread of neurosis) but a distant 30th in probability.    With Western techniques and Western computers, the pollsters of Hungary have become just as speedy and proficient as those of the West, if not yet quite so influential. Informers are probably still at work here, but the pollsters have pushed them deeper than ever into the shadows.    Hungary's pollster-in-chief is Adam Levendel, the deputy director of the Institute of Mass Communications. He has just turned 40, has a long black beard, and comes to work in a quilted vest and corduroys. A good number of the 40 experts who work for him dress the same way.    &quot;You may think public-opinion research belongs to a multi-party system where there is no official line,&quot; he says, drinking coffee at his desk one afternoon in a building that once was party headquarters. &quot;But here it is not so meaningless. We need all the time more and more information. Feedback is important now. We never get enough feedback.&quot;    With 300 interviewers, the institute runs 40 big surveys a year, 50 flash polls, and a TV-audience canvass every week. It is the East Bloc's most active polling setup and a model for its partners. Poland has had a similar enterprise since 1981, the only one besides Hungary's that lets results seep out. The East Germans and the Soviets are taking polls, too. The Soviets may be interested in taking more.    &quot;It's a very new thing in Eastern Europe,&quot; Mr. Levendel says. He leaves the room for a few minutes to take a phone call, and when he comes back he says, &quot;Somebody from Russia. We find ourselves in an interesting situation with this Gorbachev.&quot;    The institute began 19 years ago as a minor arm of state radio and television. Until then, Mr. Levendel says, asking people's opinions was deemed &quot;a bourgeois thing.&quot; But 1968 was the year Hungary brought in economic reforms that made the bottom line nearly as important as the party line. Polling slowly gained respect as a way to keep tabs on managers.    &quot;It's a means of checking on the middle levels,&quot; Mr. Levendel says. &quot;You have to know how decisions others make are working.&quot;    In 1985, the institute came into its own as an independent body, with a direct link to the Information Ministry. Any agency can ask it to run a poll, from the Central Committee on down. It still has handicaps: Telephone surveys can't be that representative in a country where a phone means status; and lingering distrust makes for high numbers of &quot;don't knows.&quot;    &quot;But the answers often refute your suspicions that people won't be honest,&quot; says Robin Cheeseman, a Danish academic who has studied Hungarian communications. &quot;When they ask how often people listen to Radio Free Europe, they get astonishingly high figures.&quot;    Surprise is none too rare. When the pollsters asked who was to blame for worsening East-West relations, 37% of those interested in foreign affairs didn't hesitate to blame both sides. The luckiest countries, said 41% in another poll, are the ones that have kept their distance from the arms race and stayed neutral.    Two-thirds of Hungary's college graduates agreed in 1986 that economic life in socialist states was &quot;characterized mostly by problems.&quot; In a similar poll, one-third said the East's main economic woe was &quot;the economy itself.&quot; Still, 31% of Hungarians think the smidgen of free enterprise they have is just a scam to help wheeler-dealers get rich. That could give Soviet reformers pause.    Hungary's own higher-ups might have done a double take at this item: Only 46% of the people knew of a much-touted election law that permits a choice among candidates; only 38% of those who did know could see a difference between the old law and the new one.    And on a campaign to increase the population, the population's opinion was resolute: 83% thought &quot;the number of children in the family is a private matter and not the concern of the state.&quot;    A knock on the door in the middle of the morning strikes no fear in the young family that occupies a cold-water flat in a Budapest tenement. An interviewer with a list of names in her knapsack has dropped by to ask the woman of the house 203 questions about the economy. A reporter isn't allowed in on the two-hour session, but when it is over, the respondent gladly responds all over again.    Her name is Erzsebet; her last name isn't recorded here, or on the official questionnaire. She is a 29-year-old Protestant, a Radio Free Europe listener and a mother of three who reads an economic weekly, owns a washing machine, an iron and a freezer, and doesn't own a car, a telephone or a video camera.    In a blue track suit, she sits on a low bed under a bookshelf in her back room. Children underfoot, she endures the barrage:    &quot;Are you better off here than in other socialist countries?&quot;    &quot;Better off here.&quot;    &quot;In your opinion, should Hungary resemble more the capitalist countries or the socialist countries?&quot;    &quot;It should resemble more the capitalist countries.&quot;    &quot;In the Hungarian economy, what changes are needed?&quot;    &quot;Fundamental.&quot;    &quot;Agree or disagree: Only prices of luxury goods should be determined by market forces.&quot;    &quot;Disagree.&quot;    &quot;Do you want little differences in earnings or big gaps?&quot;    &quot;Big gaps.&quot;    &quot;What layers of society get bigger-than-average earnings now?&quot;    &quot;Those with the biggest mouths.&quot;    Erzsebet smiles, and wraps her arms around her knees.    Some of these questions may tell more about what's eating the leaders than the led: &quot;Will there be unemployment in coming years?&quot; &quot;Does unemployment go with the principles of socialism?&quot; &quot;For those who are sacked, should benefits be provided?&quot; But hardly anybody in Hungary, least of all the pollsters, would know much about the ultimate impact of the answers.    Even in the less secretive field of market research, polls can pop like a laundrysoap bubble when they float within range of a factory manager. The Institute for Market Research runs 150 surveys a year, quizzing consumers about advertising, packaging, brand names. The latest feedback shows that huge majorities are fed up with scarcities of deep freezers and color television sets, while 48% of Hungarian men have trouble finding underpants when they shop. Without competition to speak of, though, does the underpants commissar care?    &quot;This is a way of bringing supply and demand into some kind of balance,&quot; says Laszlo Szabo, the marketing institute's director. &quot;Men want white, and maybe only pink is available.&quot; But an article in a slick magazine that the institute itself puts out may come nearer to reality: &quot;Marketing has been created and forced into existence by the market,&quot; it says. &quot;In the absence of a market, its existence is meaningless.&quot;    And in the absence of elections, what are polls to politicians?    &quot;My strong impression,&quot; says someone familiar with the system, &quot;is that the results never get to anyone who really needs to understand what the people think. I imagine some specialists in the Politburo know the truth. They are eager to get the information and hold it for themselves. It's a symbol of power.&quot;    But nobody takes political popularity polls in Hungary. Some questions -- should Soviet troops pull out? -- are too delicate to ask. And some questions that do get asked still don't get answered.    For two hours now, Erzsebet has answered with ease. She has already said she thinks Hungary's economy needs fundamental reform. Now comes the last page of the thick questionnaire.    &quot;It is impossible to make socialism and radical reforms go together: agree or disagree?&quot;    She lifts a child from her lap and sets him on the floor. There is a long silence. At last she replies, &quot;Partly agree.&quot;    &quot;For economic reforms to be successful, political reforms are necessary: agree or disagree?&quot;    Erzsebet fidgets. In the midst of a longer silence, her husband edges into the room carrying a tray of cookies and glasses of grape juice. As he lowers the tray to the coffee table, the kids mob him. A glass gets knocked over. Somebody gets slapped. Somebody cries. Erzsebet rushes out to find a sponge.    The question goes unanswered. </TEXT></DOC>
