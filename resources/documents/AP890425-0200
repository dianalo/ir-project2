The soldiers and the police counterinsurgency units of the SouthAfrican-controlled territory, also known as South-West Africa, areto remain on base from Wednesday evening through Saturday morning.   Since Monday night, radio stations, aircraft and police vehicleshave been broadcasting recorded messages from the South-WestAfrican People's Organization, telling guerrillas in the northernNamibian bush that from 6 p.m. Wednesday, only U.N. forces will bewatching the border.   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said morethan half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into the territoryApril 1 have gone back. Only a dozen have appeared atU.N.-monitored assembly points and churches because of theproximity of South African military and South-West African policeforces.   A week and a half of fighting after the incursion cost more than300 lives and endangered the United Nations independence planintended to lead to elections in November, which SWAPO is favoredto win.   South African officials said Tuesday that the 60-hour safepassage period this week will be SWAPO's last chance to get itsfighters out of the territory and into U.N.-monitored bases inAngola, from where they will return, unarmed, to participate in theelections.   SWAPO guerrillas have fought since 1966 to end South Africa's74-year rule over Namibia. SWAPO officials have said theirguerrillas were trying to go to U.N.-supervised bases in Namibia onApril 1, when South African forces were already confined to base.There was no arrangement for U.N.-supervised bases for SWAPO, whichhas fought a guerrilla war from bases in Angola.   U.N. spokesman Cedric Thornberry said 185 of the 231 U.N. policemonitors in the country would be in place in northern Namibia byWednesday and some would be accompanying the South-West Africanpolice on their normal patrols.   He said 3,723 of the 4,500 allocated military monitors are inthe country, and he expected the rest of the 500 police monitors tobe on hand by May 6.</TEXT></DOC>
