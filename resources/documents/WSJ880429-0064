The wide-ranging bill was passed 87-4, after a day of sometimes acrimonious debate. The most heated dispute came over an amendment sponsored by Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) that would outlaw any federally funded informational material that could be read to &quot;encourage&quot; homosexuality and require the material to &quot;encourage&quot; monogamy. The amendment was adopted but was superseded by more lenient language.    Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) characterized the original amendment as unnecessary, and said it could have crippled the legislation, which he co-sponsored with Orrin Hatch (R., Utah). In the end, Mr. Kennedy hailed the bill, saying, &quot;Finally, we have declared war on the virus rather than the victims of AIDS.&quot; Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) called it &quot;a landmark piece of legislation.&quot; The measure now goes to the House, which is expected to adopt similar legislation soon.    The Senate bill would declare acquired immune deficiency syndrome a &quot;public health emergency&quot; and require the Department of Health and Human Services to submit an annual plan of action to fight the disease.    &quot;This bill sets out a direction for how AIDS money is to be spent in this country,&quot; said Peri Jude Radecic, a lobbyist for the Gay and Lesbian Task Force. &quot;Right now we don't have that direction.&quot;    About $590 million would be spent on care, treatment and prevention efforts and about $450 million on research, including: national and state information programs, such as clearinghouses, hotlines and advertising; state programs for home and community based care; programs to combat AIDS among drug abusers; and additional researchers at federal facilities.    The legislation would overturn a District of Columbia law prohibiting insurance companies from requiring prospective clients to take an AIDS test. The provision may discourage other states from passing such laws, although it wouldn't prohibit it.    Unanimous approval was given to an amendment that would require mandatory AIDS testing for people convicted of sex crimes or crimes involving intravenous drug use. The results of the test would be kept confidential. But the Senate rejected a second Helms amendment that would have banned federal funds for programs that provide clean needles for drug addicts. </TEXT></DOC>
