About $700 million of debt is affected. The rating concern also downgraded Avon's $160 million of commercial paper outstanding to A-3 from A-2. Sandamp;P cited an &quot;aggressive&quot; acquisitions strategy, which it said increases the company's financial risks, and what it called Avon's &quot;poor track record with acquisitions in recent years.&quot; Avon officials hadn't any comment.    ---   YANKEE COS. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on senior secured notes of this Cohasset, Mass.-based natural-gas marketing and commercial banking concern to Caa from single-B-2 and on convertible Eurobonds issued by a unit to Caa from single-B-3. The rating concern cited &quot;substantial operating losses,&quot; primarily at the Yankee Bank unit. About $60 million of securities is affected. Yankee's debt-to-equity ratio exceeds the 3-to-1 level set in its indenture agreements, Moody's said. As a result, Yankee must make quarterly principal repayments of $2,250,000. Moody's said Yankee expects to make the payment for the current quarter but said there &quot;isn't any assurance&quot; that it will be able to do so in the next quarter. Yankee officials didn't have any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
