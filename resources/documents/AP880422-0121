(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oscar-winning screenwriter I.A.L.Diamond, who collaborated with director Billy Wilder on some ofHollywood's most popular films, has died at age 67.   Diamond, who won an Oscar in 1960 for the screenplay ``TheApartment,'' died Thursday at his Beverly Hills home of cancer. Hislongtime agent, Irving Lazar, said Diamond had been ailing forseveral months.   Lazar said he introduced Diamond to Wilder, launching a 30-yearpartnership that produced some of Hollywood's most memorablemovies, starting in 1957 with ``Love in the Afternoon,'' whichstarred Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.   Diamond's work with Wilder also included ``Some Like It Hot,''with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe; ``The Apartment''which featured Lemmon; and ``The Fortune Cookie,'' which teamedLemmon with Walter Matthau.   Diamond and Wilder collaborated on the 1974 remake of BenHecht's classic Chicago newspaper tale, ``The Front Page,'' whichagain teamed Lemmon and Matthau.   Besides his Academy Award for ``The Apartment,'' Diamond alsoreceived Oscar nominations for ``Some Like it Hot'' and ``TheFortune Cookie.''   He also wrote the 1969 screen adaptation of ``Cactus Flower''under the name Abe Burrows.   Wilder once remarked of his longtime collaborator, ``If I everlost this guy, I'd feel like Abercrombie without Fitch.''   Born Itek Dommnici in Ungheni, Romania, on June 27, 1920,Diamond came to the United States at age 9. He adopted the pen nameI.A.L. Diamond _ the initials stood for Interscholastic AlgebraLeague in reference to his early interest in mathematics.   As a youth, he won a three-state math competition that sent himto Columbia University, where he majored in math.   At Columbia, he wrote four annual student revues and edited theuniversity paper, said his wife, Barbara.   Paramount Studios brought Diamond to Hollywood in 1940. Hisfirst screen credit came four years later for ``Murder in the BlueRoom.''   In later years, Diamond was critical of writers he said onlyused the profession as a stepping stone to the director's chair.   ``There are no writers left in this business,'' he told Peoplemagazine last year. ``There are only would-be directors (who) havelearned that the best way to get a crack at directing ... is towrite a script. But most don't have the vaguest talent as writers.   ``They see writing as a phase they have to pass through, likeadolescent acne.''   In addition to his wife, Diamond is survived by a son, adaughter and one grandchild.</TEXT></DOC>
