The government announced late Tuesday that an investment group, headed by Mexicans but including Chase Manhattan Corp., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and British investor Sir James Goldsmith, will provide $140 million in fresh capital to a new airline holding company to be formed from Mexicana. The government will gradually eliminate its stake in the airline over the next three years, after which foreigners would be allowed to take a majority position if they elect to do so.    The Mexicana deal is one of the first fruits of a liberalization of Mexico's foreign investment law unveiled in May. The new investment regulations allow foreign participation in some previously closed sectors, such as airlines, and provide for automatic approval of projects of as much as $100 million in industries not reserved for public and national companies.    Before the Mexicana deal, the regulatory change had received mixed reviews. Adherents said that the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari made the best of the bad situation it encountered when it took office last December without the congressional support to repeal the old nationalistic investment law. &quot;They stretched the existing law as far as they could, a good job under severe constraints,&quot; says Miguel Jauregui, an investment lawyer whose clients include many top foreign companies.    But critics have called for a more unconditional opening. They note that Mexico's need for foreign capital has taken on far greater urgency since the recently announced Bush administration debt relief plan provided Mexico with less economic aid than was originally hoped.    By allowing significant foreign participation in Mexicana, which handles about half of Mexico's air traffic, the government is hoping to quiet those who doubt its openness. &quot;This deal shows that we are very serious about attracting foreign investment,&quot; says Carlos Camacho Gaos, the Commerce Ministry's director general of foreign investment. &quot;Under the old regulations, this wouldn't have been possible.&quot;    In the Mexicana agreement, the government's stake in the airline will be diluted to 40%, the current private shareholders will hold 35%, and the new Mexican and U.S. investment group will hold 25%. A group of Mexicans, led by the hotel and sugar mill conglomerate Grupo Xabre, will provide 52% of the new $140 million in equity. Chase Manhattan will provide 35%, a Drexel unit 7%, and a company controlled by Mr. Goldsmith, 6%.    The new investors have pledged to provide Mexicana $3 billion in new capital over the next decade. The investment is badly needed at a time when the Mexican airline industry is becoming increasingly competitive because of President Salinas's program of deregulation and privatization.    Chase's $50 million investment in Mexicana is part of an overall effort by Chase to become deeply involved in transactions that require a high degree of financial engineering -- and profit. Last year, Chase scored big in a similar U.S. deal: it reported an $11 million pretax gain on the sale of a stake in Cain Chemical Co.    Before the Mexicana restructuring, the effect of the new regulations had yet to make itself felt in a big way. Through July of this year, the Mexican Commerce Ministry approved $1.2 billion in new foreign investment, about one-quarter of which arrived through the new mechanism for automatic approval. In the previous administration, the annual average for approved foreign investment was $2.2 billion. But Mexican officials say they've seen a sharp increase in inquiries.    Companies with experience in dealing with Mexico's previous closed investment regime are the ones most impressed by the new attitude. &quot;Mexico's opening up much, much faster than I would ever have imagined,&quot; says George Kise, an executive for a Seattle-based fishing and seafood processing company. Mr. Kise was rebuffed in an effort to establish an operation in Mexico before the introduction of the new regulations, but he's been encouraged to try again.    Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the new investment policy. Highly conservative Japanese investors are put off by some of the creative mechanisms the government designed to circumvent the old law's restrictions, such as special 20-year trusts that allow foreigners to enter some once-closed industries. &quot;Why must I take this circuitous route, when what I really want is clarity and certainty?&quot; said Masato Kuwahara, general manger of Sumitomo Corp. in Mexico. Adds Seiroku Ochi, commercial director of Nissan Motor Co.'s Mexican operations: &quot;I don't think these regulations alone are going to make a great difference.&quot;    To convince doubters, the government may be unveiling another blockbuster foreign investment project soon. Government officials say they're studying several proposals from foreign investors for projects involving the government's 51%-owned Telefonos de Mexico, the huge but notoriously inefficient telephone monopoly. Analysts said the government might grant foreigners concessions in some auxiliary telephone services, such as cellular phones, that have been opened up to 100% foreign participation under the new regulations. </TEXT></DOC>
