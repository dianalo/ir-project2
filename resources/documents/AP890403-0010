Fourteen young caribou will be taken to an undisclosed areawithin the 200,000-acre Baxter State Park in northern Maine, undera 2-year-old campaign to restore the animal to the state.   Seven males and seven females, born to a herd that originated inNewfoundland, will be tranquilized and trucked to the area onTuesday and Wednesday.   The caribou will spend several weeks in a 3-acre enclosure,feasting on pellets they have lived on while in captivity. Then,they will be released.   Officials are keeping the location of the enclosure a secret,fearing that people would disturb the herd.   ``Essentially, I think the caribou could be loved to death,''said biologist Mark McCollough, director of the privately fundedMaine Caribou Reintroduction Project. ``Too many people out therecould drive them away from the best habitat.''   The reindeer-like animals were pushed to extinction in the stateby over-eager hunters, disease and development. The last Mainecaribou was seen in 1908 on the mile-high Mount Katahdin in what isnow Baxter park.   State officials have talked about bringing back the caribousince the 1920s. An attempt was made in 1963, but the two dozenCanadian caribou released in Baxter park soon vanished, a result ofpoaching and natural predators.   Biologists and wildlife officials see the latest project as anexperiment, but are resolved to try a more sophisticated, phased-inapproach.   In December 1986, more than two dozen caribou destined to becomethe state's ``nursery herd'' were captured in Newfoundland andtrucked 1,200 miles to Maine. The animals to be released are theoffspring of those caribou.   Even after the 14 caribou are released, 27 others will remainprotected in an enclosure at the University of Maine in Orono,where the oldest will continue producing calves for futurereleases. Up to 14 calves are expected to be born next month.   Between 80 and 100 young caribou are expected to be released inMaine's wilds during the next four years, said McCollough.   Biologists plan to keep close tabs on the released caribou byattaching radio collars that send a signal when the animals die.   Two other research projects at the university are investigatinga potential threat to the caribou _ the ``brainworm'' parasite,which also affects deer.   Coordinators of the reintroduction project have hired abiologist to monitor and protect the caribou at the park untiltheir final release this spring. After that, poaching remains athreat, but the Legislature has imposed maximum fines of $10,000and three years in prison for illegally killing a caribou.</TEXT></DOC>
