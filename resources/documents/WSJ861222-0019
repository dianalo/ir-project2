The 28-year-old Mr. David, a former lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, admitted to SEC civil charges Dec. 10 that he disclosed nonpublic information from the New York law firm about corporate transactions that would affect stock prices.    Mr. David is awaiting sentencing on separate criminal charges related to the scheme. Mr. David agreed in the SEC settlement to pay, over 11 years, $50,000 representing profits he was to have received from the scheme, and a separate civil penalty of as much as $100,000 that depends on his income over that period of time.    U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein had delayed approving the plan. He explained to the SEC at a hearing last week that he wouldn't &quot;sign any decree that is empty and devoid of real significance.&quot; The original consent decree, the judge said, didn't have any sanctions in the event Mr. David misses a payment over the 11 years, and that he wanted Mr. David subject to a default judgment in such a situation.    &quot;I think the SEC ought to give very careful consideration to these decrees so that there is always a provision for sanctions and not to leave that open,&quot; the judge added. The settlement approved Friday will put Mr. David in default if he misses a payment, requiring him immediately to pay the $50,000, as well as any amount he owes at that time toward the income-based civil penalty. </TEXT></DOC>
