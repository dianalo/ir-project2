SullivanandM;Connecting local and wide area networks of workstations and terminals is thegoal of the LC100 Series 2000 Universal Smart Hub, which Luxcom Inc.andO;announced last week.andM;The intelligent hub is based on Luxcom's Universal Premises Networkarchitecture, a proprietary fiber backbone that supports 100M-bps datatransmissions, said Staffan Fredricsson, Luxcom's president and CEO.andP;  Insteadof using a separate bus for each networking protocol, the Luxcom backboneprovides a single, wider bus to connect any protocol in a network, he said.andM;The eight-slot hub can house Ethernet, Token-Ring, RS-232C, IBM 3270, IBM5080, IBM 5250, Integrated Services Digital Network and, by year's end, T-1modules for linking workstations and terminals across a variety of LANs andWANs.andM;&quot;Luxcom is defining a new niche market -- IBM shops that now want tointegrate terminal traffic and LAN traffic through a hub,&quot; said MichaelHoward, president of Infonetics Research Institute Inc., a market-researchfirm in San Jose, Calif.andM;Fibermux Corp., of Chatsworth, Calif., provides a similar solution with itsMagnum100 fiber-optic backbone, Howard said.andP;  The Magnum100 supportsAppleTalk, ARCnet, AS/400, Ethernet, IBM 3270, RS-232C, T-1, Token-Ring, Wangand other protocols.andM;The Luxcom LC100 Series 2000 hub includes built-in management software thatis accessed with LC100 Network Manager software.andP;  The OS/2-based LC100software, priced at $795, supports the Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP) for managing SNMP-compliant devices in Ethernet, Token-Ring, terminaland wide area networks, said Fredricsson.andM;Ethernet connections are provided through the 12-port, 10BaseT EthernetAccess Module, priced at $2,495; the four-port, 10Base2 Ethernet AccessModule, priced at $1,495; and the single-port, 10Base5 Ethernet AccessModule, priced at $995.andP;  Token-Ring modules include the 16-port Token-RingMAU Access Module, priced at $1,995, and the Token-Ring Repeater AccessModule, which is priced at $1,995 and provides four Token-Ring connections.andM;Based in Hayward, Calif., privately held Luxcom has marketing and technologydevelopment ties to Ericsson Business Communications of Sweden.andP;  Its 1990revenues were $4.4 million, primarily from sales of its LAN hub products.andM;Luxcom sells its products directly.andP;  The firm can be reached at (415)786-1200.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
