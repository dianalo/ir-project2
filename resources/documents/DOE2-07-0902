Unfortunately, these high strengthalloys tend to exhibit poor fracture toughness, and the effects of neutronirradiation on the fracture properties of the material are of concern.Compact tension specimens of alloy D21 were irradiated in the ExperimentalBreeder Reactor II to a fluence of 2.7 x 10/sup 22/ neutrons (n)/cm/sup2/ (E andgt; 0.1 MeV) at 425, 500, 550, and 600{sup 0}C. Fracture toughnesstests on these specimens were performed using electric potential techniquesat temperatures ranging from 205 to 425{sup 0}C. The material exhibitedlow post-irradiation fracture toughness which increased with either increasingtest or irradiation temperature. The tearing modulus, however, increasedwith increasing irradiation temperature but decreased with increasingtest temperature. Results were analyzed using the J-integral approach.The fracture toughness of irradiated D21 was evaluated essentially followingthe procedure recommended in ASTM Test Method E813. It was found thatthe data elimination limits illustrated in E813 were too large for thespecimens tested, although the thickness criterion was satisfied. Theprecautions needed to determine J/sub Ic/ based on a reduced data qualificationrange were discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
