Cor Boer, a mine overseer, breaks off a piece of the rock wall and points to the reason: hundreds of sparkling specks. &quot;Of course, not everything that glitters is gold,&quot; he says, grinning broadly. &quot;But enough of it is.&quot;    The glitter in Shaft 6 has become even brighter in recent days, as the price of gold has soared to a four-year high. For the South African economy, which lives and dies by the price of gold, the rise couldn't have come at a better time.    The surge is rejuvenating the sputtering economic recovery and reinvigorating business confidence, which had sunk to rock bottom following the wave of international economic sanctions and corporate disinvestments. What's more, coming two weeks before the national parliamentary elections, gold's climb is enhancing the feeling of defiance and invincibility of the ruling National Party.    &quot;Gold is coming to the aid of the South African economy again,&quot; says Tony Twine of Econometrix, an independent economic consulting firm in Johannesburg.    Economists here figure that for every $10 increase in the price of an ounce of gold, South Africa rakes in another $200 million in annual export earnings. In the past four weeks, gold has risen from about $405 an ounce to yesterday's London fixing price of $445.50. This means that within a month, projected 1987 South African export earnings have increased by $800 million -- 10 times more than the value of all the goods exported in one year by neighboring Mozambique.    For a country facing tight credit restrictions from international lenders, this is quite a luxury. &quot;Growth in South Africa is highly geared to imports,&quot; says Mr. Twine. &quot;With the squeeze on foreign capital, we have to pay for all imports through current accounts. So every dollar that comes in from gold helps to pay for imports.&quot;    Ever since gold was discovered in Johannesburg 100 years ago, it has been the savior of South Africa. At the moment, it is the country's ace in the hole against economic sanctions. Gold and South Africa's other precious metals, which are found so abundantly in few other places in the world, bring in about 75% of South Africa's foreign-exchange earnings and contribute nearly 20% to the gross domestic product. And the fact that South Africa possesses 65% of the West's gold reserves makes the metal an unlikely target of sanctions.    &quot;Very simply, gold is the elixir of life for South Africa,&quot; says a top official of one of the country's biggest mining houses. &quot;Our history has been one of political mistakes and economic good fortune.&quot;    Indeed, it is one of the great ironies of South Africa that as the political crisis worsens, the country actually grows richer. It is also one of the great tragedies, for it contributes to a false sense of security in much of South Africa's white community. At the same time, it increases the frustration of blacks because little of the gold-generated wealth ends up in their pockets.    At the moment, tensions in the black townships and among black workers are increasing as strikes become more common. Meanwhile, the economy is expected to grow by 3% this year, the trade surplus is at record levels and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is booming. And gold analysts predict the price will reach $500 an ounce by the end of the year.    Part of the reason for this dichotomy is that gold investors fear the political turmoil in South Africa will spread to the mines and hurt production. While the main factors behind the recent gold surge seem to be uncertainties in the U.S. economy and international trade tensions, analysts here also say the unrest in South Africa is playing a role.    The potential for a political showdown on the mines has increased in the past couple of years as the National Union of Mineworkers has emerged as a powerful force in the black community. So far, the union has concentrated on using its influence (it claims it has organized half of the 650,000 black miners) to negotiate higher wages and better work and living conditions on the mines.    But the pressures on the union to score political points are growing. At the national convention this year, delegates frequently mentioned the notion of shutting down the mining industry, and thus the entire economy, with a well-timed strike.    But, says Marcel Golding, a union official, &quot;We still have a long way to go to consolidate the industry. South Africa's political economy is based on mining, it's the strategic center, and it gives us a power. But the balance of forces in the mining industry is still uneven.&quot;    Down in Shaft 6 at the Hartebeestfontein mine, where there's enough gold to keep miners busy for the next 25 years, Mr. Boer, the overseer, reflects on those forces, and that balance, but particularly on that commodity.    &quot;Every country has something, and we've got gold,&quot; he says. &quot;Without it, we'd be a poor country. We would really be in trouble.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
