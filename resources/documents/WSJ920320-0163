Regulators have never closed the entire Pacific salmonseason, nor limited it as severely as is now contemplated.Most salmon for the U.S. market comes from Alaska, BritishColumbia and South American countries, much of it from fishfarms, but closing the Pacific season could idle tens ofthousands of fishermen, cannery workers, sports fishingguides and others.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed drastic action reflects regulators' concernover a rapid collapse in salmon populations in the lastseveral years all up and down the Pacific coast, from theMexican border to Canada.   Though drought and unusually warm waters stirred up by ElNino currents are partly to blame, the main culprits areman-made: Logging, population growth and pollution have wipedout hundreds of miles of salmon habitat throughout the West,and overfishing has further depleted salmon numbers.   &quot;This is a very grim moment,&quot; said Bill Baake, resourcedirector for Oregon Trout, a fish advocacy group. &quot;All theactivities that have been depleting salmon runs for decadesseem to have culminated in a situation where there are nofish.&quot;   Today, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, aquasi-governmental agency that sets U.S. fishing policies inthe Pacific, will issue a plan proposing options ranging frombanning salmon fishing this year to limiting the salmon catchto only 60% of last year's haul. The council will make afinal decision on how severe the limits will be in mid-April.In most areas in the West, the salmon fishing season beginsin early summer.   Curtailing fishing would hammer the commercial andsport-fishing industries on the West Coast, which generate anestimated $1 billion a year in economic output for theregion. That industry has been in decline for years, alongwith salmon populations. Fishery biologists estimate thatsalmon catches in Pacific coastal waters have plunged by 80%from historic peaks in the early years of this century.   Moreover, U.S. commercial fishermen have been hurt bycompetition from the burgeoning salmon farming industry,particularly in Norway, Japan and Chile. Salmon farmers raisehundreds of millions of fish annually in enclosed pens andcan deliver them to market more quickly and cheaply than mostsalmon boat operators.   &quot;This will be the death knell for a lot of Pacific coastfishermen, their families and their way of life,&quot; said TryggSletteland, a fisheries consultant in Redding, Calif.   Salmon consumers aren't likely to find prices rising orfish scarce, however.   Fisheries biologists believe the limits could helpstabilize the dwindling salmon stocks. Once the drought nowaffecting much of the West Coast and the warm ocean currentsassociated with El Nino end, salmon survival and reproductionshould improve. But barring a halt to habitat destruction,biologists don't see much hope for a significant rebound insalmon numbers. &quot;Unless habitat loss is reversed, in 30 or 40years, there won't be enough salmon left to justify anycommercial fishing,&quot; said Mr. Baake, the Oregon Troutresource director.   Indeed, the proposed regulatory limits underscore thedesperate plight of the salmon, which remains a powerfulsymbol of the Pacific Coast's wild past. The AmericanFisheries Society, an association of professional fisheriesbiologists, estimates that 214 separate populations of salmonor trout on the West Coast are in jeopardy; more than 100 ofthose are near extinction, the group says. Federal regulatorsrecently placed two once-huge salmon runs on the EndangeredSpecies List, and have recommended others for protection.   But restoring habitat would require costly sacrifices bycities and industries whose water and land-use practices havedestroyed salmon spawning grounds. The conflict is mostintense along the Columbia River, where federal dams,irrigation, logging and other activities have decimatedsalmon runs that once numbered in the tens of millions offish. Federal agencies are trying to work out a plan to savesome of the endangered salmon along the Columbia, but waterusers fear any substantial fish-restoration efforts couldcost the Pacific Northwest's economy billions of dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
