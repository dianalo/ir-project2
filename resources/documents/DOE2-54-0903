<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0903 </DOCNO><TEXT>The purpose of this handbook is to provide a comprehensive guide to sampling,analytical, and physical test methods essential to the operation, maintenance,and understanding of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system chemistry.EPRI sponsored the first edition of this three-volume report in responseto the needs of electric utility personnel responsible for establishingand operating commercial FGD analytical laboratories. The second, revisededitions of Volumes 1 and 2 were prompted by the results of researchinto various non-standard aspects of FGD system chemistry. Volume 1 ofthe handbook explains FGD system chemistry in the detail necessary tounderstand how the processes operate and how process performance indicatorscan be used to optimize system operation. Volume 2 includes 63 physical-testingand chemical-analysis methods for reagents, slurries, and solids andinformation on the applicability of individual methods to specific FGDsystems. Volume 3 contains instructions for an FGD solution chemistrycomputer program designed by EPRI as FGDLIQEQ. Executable on IBM-compatiblepersonal computers, this program calculates the concentrations (activities)of chemical species (ions) in scrubber liquor and can calculate drivingforces for important chemical reactions such as SO{sub 2} absorptionand calcium sulfite and surface precipitation. This program and selectedchemical analyses will help an FGD system operator optimize system performance,prevent many potential process problems, and define solutions to existingproblems.</TEXT></DOC>
