<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-0792 </DOCNO><TEXT>The study of tetragonal ZrO/sub 2/ is of great technological importancebecause of the 9 per cent volume increase accompanying the t -andgt; m transformation.This paper discusses the effect of processing parameters on the tetragonalphase formation in and stability of a 2 mol per cent yttria stabilizedzirconia. The quenching process yields large amounts of transformabletetragonal particles and a part/most of it transforms to monoclinic formon subsequent annealing treatments. The results of X-ray diffractionphase analyses and bend strength studies are reported and analysed. (author).3 tables, 7 figures, 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
