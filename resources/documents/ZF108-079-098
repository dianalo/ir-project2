Richey Jr.andM;PHS surveyors recently changed from an older UNIX computer-aided designsystem to networked AutoCAD from Autodesk Inc., Sausalito, Calif., andAutomated Facilities Manager software from Kandl Data Products/Cadserver,Beltsville, Md.andM;The facilities management system runs on 20-MHz micros from NEC America Inc.,andO;Melville, N.Y., on a Novell Inc. Netware 2.12 SFT Ethernet network.andM;&quot;By 1985 the old system was buggy, difficult to work with and obsolete.&quot; saidprogrammer-analyst Jon angel.andP;  &quot;In reality, most people were interested intwo things: managing renovations and tracking space utilization.&quot;andM;Angel said PHS chose AutoCAD because it is an open product.andM;&quot;We can customize not only the menus and the way you work with it, but alsothe essential work it does,&quot; he said.andM;Heather Ransom, chief of the Real Property Management Branch, said PHS now isable to isolate more structural layers such as ceiling grids.andM;&quot;We hope to do electrical surveys,&quot; Ransom said.andP;  &quot;Up to now, it's been basedon memory and whatever files you can find.&quot;andM;Maintaining data integrity is crucial, Angel said.andM;&quot;If you have drawings wandering all over the place on floppy, you havechaos,&quot; he said.andM;The new system maintains a well-protected set of master drawings, Angel said.andM;The networked stations have 19-inch NEC color multisync monitors, driven byRenaissance I cards from Renaissance GRX Inc., Bellevue, Wash.andP;  A masterstation has an Artist 10 high-resolution display card from Control SystemsInc., St. Paul, Minn., and a Superscan monitor from Hitachi America Ltd.,andO;Tarrytown, N.Y.andM;The group's original Hewlett-Packard Co. 7586 plotter still makes largedrawings.andP;  A NEC LC 890 PostScript laser printer produces standard-sizecopies.andM;Work is backed up on floppy disks, removable cartridges and 60M tape.andP;  Anuninterruptible power source guards against electrical problems.andM;&quot;Productivity at this point is close to a wash, because the surveyors startedout pretty much from ground zero in September,&quot; Ransom said.andP;  &quot;But accuracyis [improved] tenfold.&quot;andM;She said being able to measure the equipment and materials used inrenovations will reduce costs.andM;&quot;We have to negotiate with the building's owner once a year,&quot; Ransom added.andO;&quot;Now we have some real tracking data.andP;  We might be able to say, 'Look, thisis a fairly extensve project.andP;  We use a lot of outlets here, we ought to geta cut rate on this.'&quot;andM;Although the system has replaced templates, paper, white-out and copies,Ransom said it still is people-oriented: &quot;Even though you can physically dothe mechanics and wire the various locations, unless you have an operator whois tuned in, it doesn't work.&quot;andM;The conversion cost $250,000.andP;  within two months, the surveyors wereproducing usable AutoCAD drawings.andP;  within four months, they were linkingwith space management databases.andM;&quot;In the original system, operators had to make changes in two places,&quot; Angelsaid.andP;  &quot;An operator would document a renovation and measure the square feetwithin the drawing.andP;  Then separately, often from handwritten notes, theoperator would change the database.&quot;andM;The surveyors now use a structured query language-based database fromInformix Software, Menlo Park, Calif., with fourth-generation languagemodules.andM;&quot;One thing we see for the future is improving the database by writing it in a4GL and making it interactive with the drawing,&quot; Angel said.andM;Other changes include adding the floor plans of additional buildings PHS isplanning in the Rockville area.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
