BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Debt-ridden Fruehauf Corp. is selling its trucktrailer business, but the familiar name still will be on the road,the buyer says.   ``We plan to continue in the trailer business. We plan tocontinue the Fruehauf name,'' said Marvin Rosenberg, secretary ofGreen Bay, Wis.-based Terex Corp., said Tuesday.   Detroit-based Fruehauf said it will sell its trailer operation,two shipping dry docks in Florida and one in Maryland, and its 80percent interest in CEMCO, a maker of ship loading cranes, to aTerex subsidiary for $232.5 million.   The subsidiary, FRH Acquisition, will pay $169.4 million in cashand assume about $63.1 million in long-term debt in a transactionexpected to be closed May 15, Fruehauf said.   Fruehauf, still battling debt from a 1986 leveraged buyout, alsowill be entertaining offers for its major remaining business,Kelsey-Hayes Co., a maker of aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakingsystems and other auto components, Fruehauf spokesman David A.Hladik said.   Anthony G. Viscogliosi, a securities analyst at Roney andamp; Co. inDetroit, said Kelsey-Hayes will be an attractive acquisition target.   Suitors could include German, Japanese or other foreigncompanies that want a foothold in the U.S. automobile equipmentmarket and currently enjoy a currency-exchange advantage,Viscogliosi said.   Rosenberg declined to comment on what changes Terex plans forFruehauf employees and plants.   Elsewhere, efficiency has ruled when the maker of heavy-duty,off-road earth-moving equipment has acquired troubled companies andbrought them to profitability, he said.   ``We have focused on manufacturing efficiencies, looking attheir strengths, where their profits lie, and making sure they arenot overburdened with large overcapacity,'' he said.   Other Terex units such as Northwest Engineering Co. in GreenBay, Unit Rig Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., and Koehring Cranes andExcavators Inc. in Iowa were in financial trouble when acquired,Rosenberg said. ``They are all now profitable.''   Viscogliosi said shocks and adjustments are likely but predicteda favorable outcome.   ``I would think it would be a plus in terms of morale for theemployees. They're finally going to get out from under,'' he said.   Fruehauf had been reviewing several acquisition proposals,including one from Varity Corp., a Toronto farm equipment makerthat used to be called Massey-Ferguson, that was withdrawn Feb. 27,Hladik said.   Negotiations between Terex and Fruehauf intensified in the pastweek and were concluded Monday night, Rosenberg said.   Fruehauf has sold off divisions and recently proposed arecapitalization plan in the wake of the 1986 leveraged buyout thatcreated more than $1 billion in debt.   Fruehauf managers arranged the buyout with the financial help ofMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., which obtained a 31 percent voting interest,to avoid a takeover bid by New York investor Asher Edelman. Edelmansold his Fruehauf stock at a profit and also received a $21 millionpayment from the company.   Fruehauf, which employs about 15,800 people, reported losses of$41.5 million on revenue of $1.96 billion in 1987 and losses of$56.5 million on revenue of $2.09 billion in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
