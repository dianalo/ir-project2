But three years ago the head of research at the AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. lab, Arno Penzias, ordered him togive up and work on something else. Furious and defiant, Mr.Mollenauer instead continued to tinker at his 12-by-4-footlab table covered with lasers and loops of fiber-optic cable.</LP><TEXT>   Subsequent progress led Mr. Penzias to apologize for hisdoubts and praise Mr. Mollenauer's persistence in a talk toBell Labs's top researchers. Last year in his lab Mr.Mollenauer sent his special pulses 6,000 miles through aglass cable without regeneration, 10 times the commercialdistance record.   But now the 54-year-old scientist is struggling against adeadline. By autumn, he must persuade designers of ATandamp;T'snext undersea cables to use a system carrying his lightpulses, called solitons. &quot;We're almost there; I know we cando it,&quot; he says softly.   Immediately at stake is technology that could give ATandamp;T abig edge in what is anticipated to be a $750 billion a yearglobal market for optic transmission of telephone, data andtelevision signals. If Mr. Mollenauer fails, hisscientifically elegant solitons may never be used, and allhis toil and defiance may come to naught. Or British andJapanese rivals, also chasing solitons, may commercializethem first. Just last week, Japan's Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone Corp. claimed a research breakthrough in opticalamplification that could cut production costs of sometransmission systems to 10% of current levels.   But the larger issue concerns the changing role ofindustrial science. For Messrs. Mollenauer and Penzias andcorporate laboratories throughout America, mere genius is nolonger enough. Increasingly, they are pressured to produceinnovations that pay off quickly. &quot;The costs of Randamp;D keepgoing up,&quot; says Jan H. Suwinski, head of Corning Inc.'sOpto-Electronics Group. &quot;Every company is trying to improveits hit rate {and} one of the hardest things is figuring outwhat {research} to stop.&quot;   Charles V. Shank, director of Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratories in Berkeley, Calif., who once supervised Mr.Mollenauer at Bell Labs, says he is &quot;very concerned that{such pressures} will mean that work like Mollenauer did maynever be done again at Bell Labs.&quot;   Mr. Penzias responds, &quot;My motto is research for fun andprofit. If you just have fun you doom the organization toirrelevance . . . and who'd want to work here?&quot;   Mr. Penzias, who won a Nobel prize in physics for studiesof cosmic radiation, acknowledges that trying to halt Mr.Mollenauer's work was a mistake. &quot;We allocate our resourcesas best we can,&quot; he says. &quot;Occasionally I allow researchersto overrule me when I'm wrong and people in the organizationconvinced me my call wasn't right.&quot;   Mr. Mollenauer's technology tackles a problem analogous tothat faced by sailors who communicate at sea by blinkingsignal lights &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot; The faster a sailor can blinkthe shutter, the more information he can transmit per second.But if he goes too fast the &quot;on&quot; pulses of light begin toobscure the &quot;off&quot; patches of dark and the message is lost.   Telephone companies transmit their fastest information byblinking a laser beam on and off and sending the lightthrough glass fibers about the thickness of human hair. Butwhile a navy signalman might send two or three blinks persecond, telephone engineers transmit billions of blinks, or&quot;bits,&quot; per second. They are constantly trying to load moreinformation on the laser beam by increasing the blink or&quot;bit&quot; rate. These efforts are now running into a blurringproblem -- particularly over long distances.   The problem is that different light frequencies travel atdifferent speeds through optical fiber. As a pulse of laserlight zips down a fiber, some of its frequencies move fasterthan others, and the pulse starts to spread out. Over a longdistance -- say, across the Atlantic or Pacific ocean -- thespreading pulses begin running into each other, smearing themessage.   A solution was first proposed in 1973 when Akira Hasegawa,a theoretical physicist at Bell Labs, wrote that it might bepossible to generate a pulse of light that shot down anoptical fiber without changing its wave-like shape. The ideaactually originated with a 19th-century Scottish shipbuilderand engineer named John Russell. As he followed on horsebacka wave's progress through the Union Canal outside Edinburgh,Mr. Russell noted that the wave rolled on without losing itsshape.   By the 1960s scientists were calling these waves solitons,coined from &quot;solitary&quot; and the suffix &quot;-on,&quot; denoting a unitor a quantum. Since the mid-1970s satellites have spottedthese strange waves in the oceans, sometimes a half-milebeneath the surface. Some scientists theorize that a solitoncaused the mysterious sinking of the U.S. nuclear submarineThresher with its crew of 129 men off the Massachusetts coastin 1963.   It wasn't until the early 1980s that Mr. Hasegawa's theorycould be tested in the lab. Mr. Mollenauer invented a laserthat emitted light of sufficient intensity in the rightfrequency range to produce soliton pulses. And manufacturersdeveloped optical fiber with a core small enough to keep thesoliton pulses from breaking up and sufficiently pure tocarry them long distances.   By the mid-1980s, Mr. Mollenauer was using the new fiberand soliton lasers to test a later theory of Mr. Hasegawa'son preventing light loss in fiber. Mr. Hasegawa proposed thatlight sent through fiber at very short wavelengths wouldactually turn the fiber into its own amplifier, keeping thelight pulses alive. This could let ATandamp;T eliminate much of theslow and costly regenerating gear it must now string likebeads every 100 kilometers along an undersea cable to detect,retime and recreate optical pulses.   In February 1988, Mr. Mollenauer and a team of researchersmanaged in a lab to transmit light pulses 4,000 kilometersthrough optical fiber without regeneration, about thedistance between New York and Los Angeles. (In the test, thelight traveled around a 100-kilometer loop of glass fiberwound on a spool.) &quot;It was spectacular,&quot; says Mr. Mollenauer,who invited the team home for dinner and wine that night tocelebrate.   But since he still had to use laser amplifiers, BellLabs's developers felt the soliton system wouldn't befeasible for an undersea cable. That's when Mr. Shank &quot;gaveme a pat on the back and handed me a bonus check for doingsuch a good job,&quot; says Mr. Mollenauer. Then &quot;he said Arnothinks perhaps you've done enough on soliton. We'll give yousix months to look for something new to work on.&quot;   &quot;I was infuriated,&quot; says Mr. Mollenauer. So much so thathe &quot;went ahead and did my experiments anyway, thinkingmanagement would back down, which they did. . . .I just knewI was right if I could get the proof to change their minds,&quot;he says.   Mr. Mollenauer's self-confidence stemmed from a lifetimeof conducting scientific experiments. He was introduced tolasers when, as a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford, his thesisadviser was Arthur Schawlow, who had co-invented the laser atBell Labs. In 1972, after seven years of teaching physics atBerkeley, Mr. Mollenauer joined Bell Labs. His title is&quot;distinguished member of the technical staff.&quot; His salary is&quot;in the neighborhood&quot; of $100,000, excluding bonus, placinghim among the top-paid researchers at ATandamp;T.   A technical breakthrough in 1989 gave Mr. Mollenauer theopening he sought. By coating glass with the rare elementerbium, scientists produced an optical fiber that could actas its own amplifier when light was shined on it. Thetechnique, developed separately at Bell Labs, NipponTelegraph and Britain's University of Southampton, eliminatedthe need for pulse regeneration and slashed the cost ofamplifiers spaced along undersea cables.   After it was outlined at a scientific meeting in Japan,the chief of Bell Labs' undersea lightwave systemsdevelopment, Peter Runge, was quick to see the potentialvalue of the erbium-doped fibers -- as well as to notice theinterest of ATandamp;T rivals. He set in motion a campaign to speederbium-doped fiber systems to market. That forced thequestion of whether erbium-treated cable would use Mr.Mollenauer's solitons or the current technology.   The existing system for sending messages on laser beams isknown as NRZ modulation, for &quot;non-return to zero,&quot; whichmeans that the laser stays turned on until it receives a codefor zero. NRZ is less sophisticated than the solitontechnology and can't accommodate multiple channels, which canboost an overseas cable's capacity exponentially. But NRZ'sreliability is proven -- no small point when weighing the$1.5 billion investment required for the next Atlantic andPacific cables.   Mr. Mollenauer thus found himself in competition with agroup headed by Neal Bergano, which was trying to increasethe &quot;bit rate&quot; of NRZ technology. Mr. Bergano had also usederbium-doped fiber to goose old reliable NRZ to transmit fivegigabits (roughly equivalent to five million 200-page books)per second, error-free, in his lab. But he and otherscientists agree that is NRZ's speed limit.   Mr. Mollenauer is sure he can easily achieve five to 10gigabits per second this year and faster with solitons, butis awaiting test equipment that can prove his point. &quot;Ourbit-error rates are a little behind {his} but we're catchingup fast,&quot; he says. &quot;We're almost there.&quot;   Soliton technology is more complicated than NRZ butpotentially many times more profitable because of itsmulti-channel capability. In April Mr. Mollenauer usedsoliton lasers and the erbium-doped, self-amplifying fiber tohit 2.5 gigabits, or about the speed that ATandamp;T plans to usein the next undersea systems, over 7,500 kilometers inlength.   That's about the distance needed for a cable to cross theocean floor between the U.S. and the U.K., says Mr.Mollenauer, &quot;meaning transmission across the Atlantic can beaccomplished without expensive regeneration equipment.&quot; Andhis test equipment showed an error rate of only one mistakeevery 10 billion pulses -- essentially error free.   The Bell Labs physicist has until October or November toprove his system can send error-free messages a distance of9,000 kilometers, about the distance a cable would have toreach across the Pacific. If his system fails to make thenext generation of undersea cables, it's possible it could beshoved aside by new developments either at Bell Labs orelsewhere.   ATandamp;T's rivals are also hot on the trail of solitons.Researchers at Nippon Telegraph have made breakthroughs inerbium amplification and have managed to transmit solitonpulses at 20 gigabits per second over short distances. WhileKiyoshi Nakagawa, who heads NTT's research, professes doubtabout using soliton systems soon, he has a fifth of his staffof 23 researchers working on them.   &quot;Soliton we are studying for the next, next generation&quot;which would need &quot;maybe 100 gigabits&quot; transmission, Mr.Nakagawa says. &quot;If the demand {for high-speed voice and dataservice} is very large, we must hurry up.&quot; NTT's solitondesigns could find their way into equipment sold by suchJapanese powerhouses as Fujitsu and NEC -- companies thathave gained a firm beachhead in the U.S.   Meanwhile, British Telecommunications PLC &quot;has put verystrong importance on soliton research. . .for about 10 yearsnow,&quot; says Kevin Smith, a scientist who worked on solitonswith Mr. Mollenauer before joining BT's labs in Ipswich,England. In fact, BT, which is creating a global network tograb lucrative corporate communications traffic from ATandamp;T,has made tremendous strides in soliton laser research.   Mr. Mollenauer, who recently shared Britain's prestigiousRank prize with Mr. Hasegawa for their soliton research,knows his rivals well and still shudders about almost havingstopped his work. &quot;This happens all the time to scientists. ..where many ideas have been short-circuited&quot; by uppermanagement, Mr. Mollenauer says. &quot;There are many pieces to apuzzle. Everybody has to be patient until they all fall intoplace.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          FIVE GIGABITS is roughly equivalent to 5,000 200-pagebooks. A recent page-one article on research in fiber-opticdata transmission erroneously gave the equivalent as fivemillion 200-page books.   (July 12, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
