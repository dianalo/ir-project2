Nicaragua and the Persian Gulf haveundergone some changes since, but some in Congress areobviously still smarting. There is a proposal afoot thatCongress pass a resolution lobbying the Supreme Court to takeIndependent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's side against Mr. North.   Senate legal counsel Michael Davidson last month sentGeorge Mitchell and the rest of the leadership a plan, whichwould let the Senate help rescue its creation, theindependent counsel. The resolution would have Senate lawyerssubmit a legal brief to the Supreme Court supporting Mr.Walsh. A 20-page draft brief warns that the law as it nowstands threatens Congress's &quot;investigative responsibility.&quot;The spectacle of Congressmen ganging up on Mr. North bytaking sides in a criminal appeal was too much for SenatorOrrin Hatch, who so far has persuaded his colleagues to dropthe idea.</LP><TEXT>   Vindictiveness is never pretty, but surely Congress hasalready had its best shot at Mr. North. The Justices haven'tdecided whether to hear the appeal. The self-answering legalissue is: Can Congress force someone to drop his FifthAmendment right against testifying by guaranteeing himimmunity from criminal prosecution based on the testimony,and then return later to sic an independent counsel on himanyway without proving that the evidence was untainted bycoerced congressional testimony?   Recall that Mr. North was convicted by a jury only on thelesser charges, including the heinous receipt of a securityfence for his home. One of the reasons the federal appealscourt in Washington reversed was that Mr. Walsh made thelegal blunder of ignoring Mr. North's right that his forcedtestimony to Congress not be used against him.   To be fair to Mr. Walsh, he warned Congress several timesbefore its Iran-Contra hearings that if Mr. North and JohnPoindexter were forced to testify it would make any latercriminal prosecution almost impossible. Congress decided togo ahead with the hearings anyway, and the American publicgot an opportunity to make its own judgments about theaffair. But public judgment, we learned, was not what theIran-Contra investigation was about. It was about punishingthe other side. In the event, Mr. Walsh made the fatefuldecision to prosecute despite the congressional immunity. Aswe and the ACLU warned in 1988, this made the trials fatallyflawed.   Judges Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle noted intheir opinion reversing the North conviction that there wasclear evidence that witnesses were &quot;tainted.&quot; RobertMcFarlane actually changed his testimony to Congress afterhearing Mr. North's testimony. Mr. Walsh's lead witness, Rep.Lee Hamilton, was cochairman of the Iran-Contra committee.This is not a close call.   There is little reason for the Supreme Court to hear Mr.Walsh's appeal. There is no disagreement among federal courtsthat prosecutors must prove there is no use of immunizedtestimony. As a matter of separation of powers, the Justicesalso know that Congress's job is to gather information, notcriminally prosecute people as part of a policy dispute withthe President.   There could come a day when Congress would have a hardchoice between holding public hearings or allowing a criminaltrial, but Iran-Contra poses no such terrible quandary.</TEXT></DOC>
