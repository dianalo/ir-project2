Mr. Kimmitt's nomination, if approved by the Senate, wouldcome at a time of profound change during which Germanunification and the end of the Cold War have produced a moreindependent, assertive Germany. These changes wereunderscored last week when Germany voted to move its capitalto Berlin from Bonn.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kimmitt, currently the State Department'sundersecretary for political affairs, is one of a coterie oftop aides who run the department for Secretary of State JamesBaker. He also is a central figure within theadministration's national security apparatus as a member ofthe Deputies Committee, a group of officials just belowCabinet level from national security agencies and departmentswho meet regularly to handle foreign policy crises.   Mr. Kimmitt couldn't be reached for comment yesterday andState Department officials refused to comment.   He would succeed the current U.S. ambassador, VernonWalters, who announced earlier this week that he wasresigning. Mr. Walters didn't enjoy such close relations withMessrs. Bush and Baker and played a limited role inU.S.-German relations.   Two key issues that would confront Mr. Kimmitt with thepotential for creating frictions in the U.S.-Germanrelationship are differences over how to aid the Soviet Unionand U.S. concerns that Germany isn't doing more to lower itsinterest rates.   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is leaning more towardaiding the ailing Soviets than either the U.S. or Japan.Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will discuss this issuewith the leaders of the U.S., Germany and otherindustrialized nations during a meeting in London in July.   And underlying some differences on economic policy,President Bush urged Mr. Kohl during a recent White Housemeeting to push for lower interest rates.   If he becomes the next U.S. envoy to Germany, Mr. Kimmittalso will have to cope with lingering resentment in the U.S.that Germany did little to support the American-led coalitioneffort in the war against Iraq. Publicly, administrationofficials tend to play down this issue but privately theyexpress disappointment that Germany didn't join thecoalition.   At the State Department, Mr. Kimmitt is one of the firstpeople Mr. Baker turns to during moments of crisis. Mr.Kimmitt, 43 years old, was general counsel of the Treasuryfrom 1985 to 1987, when Mr. Baker was Treasury secretaryduring the Reagan administration. Prior to that, Mr. Kimmittwas executive secretary and general counsel of the NationalSecurity Council.</TEXT></DOC>
