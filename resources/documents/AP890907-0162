DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An admitted penny stock scam artist, wearing ahood to conceal his identity, told a House subcommittee Thursdaythat penny stocks traded over-the-counter are often controlled byorganized crime.   Lorenzo Formato, a former broker and promotor of the inexpensivebut highly risky securities known as penny stocks, testified that``organized crime has their hand on the shoulder of someone insideany (over-the-counter) brokerage that's making money.''   Formato is now in the federal Witness Protection Program.   He told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee ontelecommunications and finance that although there are legitimatecompanies offering their stocks over-the-counter they are oftenmanipulated by brokers, promoters or salesmen.   Although their price _ a few cents up to a few dollars a share _makes penny stocks attractive to small investors with limited funds,many are prone to abuse because information about the issuingcompany often is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficultto dispute.   Small or young companies, or those that trade infrequently or ina limited area, are often listed only on so-called ``pink sheets''rather than with larger and more stable companies. Brokers andinvestors must call a broker that deals in a specific company'sshares to get a price quote.   According to a survey by state securities regulators, Americaninvestors have been cheated out of at least $2 billion a year bycrooked schemes involving penny stocks.   The National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatingorganization that oversees over-the-counter stock brokers, said anyinvestigation of organized crime links to the industry was ingovernment hands.   ``We're cracking down hard on unscrupulous penny stock brokers,but we're not Elliott Ness,'' said Robert Ferri, a NASD spokesman.``If an investigation has to go farther than our purview, the lawenforcement agency we're dealing with will take it from there. Andthat's quite often the FBI or the Justice Department.''   ``Penny stock swindles are now the No. 1 threat of fraud andabuse facing small mom-and-pop investors in the United States,''said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman. Hecalled Formato's testimony ``a blistering, scalding indictment ofthe entire penny stock market.''   Formato entered the crowded congressional hearing room surroundedby federal marshals and wearing a gray hood with holes for hismouth, nose and eyes. He testified from behind a screen with hisvoice altered deliberately to protect his identity.   He said he got involved with the mob in his native New Jersey toprevent competitors from trying to undercut him.   ``I needed the protection. I needed the strength of organizedcrime,'' he said.   But Formato, who is serving a six-year prison sentence incognito,declined to say what organized crime family he was involved with.   He pleaded guilty in 1987 to charges of income tax evasion, mailfraud and interstate transportation of money taken in stock fraud,according to Robert Warren, a federal prosecutor in Newark, N.J.   Formato was the government's key witness at the trial of fivepeople later convicted of participating in a penny stock fraudinvolving a bogus company, Laser Arms Corp., that purported to havedeveloped a self-chilling beverage can.   Formato was described at the trial as one of the mastermindsbehind the scam. In addition to the five convicted at trial, nineother people pleaded guilty to charges involving Laser Arms.   Formato gave several recommendations for cleaning up the pennystock market, especially tougher penalties.   He said he used to laugh at the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the watchdog of the stocks and bonds markets, because itdid not have the authority to put him behind bars.   ``I did not fear the Securities and Exchange Commission,''Formato said. ``They could only attack me on a civil basis. Thepeople who bought the stocks lost their money.''   ``There are thousands of people making millions of dollars doingwhat he did,'' said John Baldwin, director of the Utah Division ofSecurities.   Baldwin is also president of the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, a Washington-based organization of statesecurities regulators.   ``The evidence is clear and convincing: Penny stock fraud hasevolved into a problem of truly national proportions,'' said Baldwin.   A report on NASAA's 50-state survey of securities regulatorsnoted that investors in legitimate penny stocks ``are believed tolose all or some of their investment 70 percent of the time and thepresence of fraud pushes up that figure to 90 percent.''   The SEC has created a Penny Stock Task Force and has adoptedrules that will make tougher to sell penny stocks over the telephone.</TEXT></DOC>
