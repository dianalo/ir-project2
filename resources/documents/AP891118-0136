(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice PresidentDan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northernAlabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.   Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debrisleft by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured atCrestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.   The tornado left 18 people dead, hundreds injured and up to1,000 homeless. The youngest victim, a 2{-year-old girl, diedFriday after being taken off life-support systems.   ``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ...regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so thatthey could survive,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov.Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby.   Mrs. Quayle, who made similar visits to San Francisco after theOct. 17 earthquake and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo, alsopraised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsvillerecover.   Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever isnecessary to help Huntsville, even if disaster relief funds aresqueezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake.   ``We're here to get the job done,'' Grant Peterson, associatedirector of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday.``Whatever's needed will be done.''   President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA mayhave to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash ofnatural disasters. Parts of eight states have been declaredeligible for federal relief.   ``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in Californiaexceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone,'' Peterson said.   Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMAafter Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast inSeptember, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravagedparts of northern California on Oct. 17.   So far, about $1.3 billion has been allocated to disastervictims. Peterson said he's not yet concerned about FEMA meetingits financial obligations.   ``I would say that to ask for any more money at this point wouldbe premature,'' he said.   Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task ofprocessing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area.   ``If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should getthe first checks out,'' Peterson said Friday. ``I'll make sure thatwe expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.''   The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost ofproviding clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, withthe federal government pitching in the other 75 percent. Gov. Huntsaid he expected the Alabama Legislature to come up with whatevermoney is needed.   ``The state doesn't budget for disasters,'' said Danny Cooper,Alabama's emergency management director. ``We take care of them atthe time.''   Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulderthe entire load. He requested donations to agencies such as theAmerican Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless asrescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hoursafter the tornado struck.   The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force _ winds wereestimated at 250 mph _ and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m.Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction.   A shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings wereleveled. Cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of ademolition derby.   Cooper said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage.Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildingswere either destroyed or suffered heavy damage.   Neighbors pitched in to help Debra McKay and her family pickthrough the rubble of their home. The only things standing were thewalls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway _ the area whereMs. McKay and her three children rode out the storm.   ``I know the Lord spared us,'' she said. ``I woke up a differentperson this morning.''   Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled intoHuntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods.   ``There's a sense of thankfulness,'' Hunt said. ``It'sheartwarming to see how people have come together.''   Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, theArmy's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries. MayorSteve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand thetornado's financial impact.   ``Huntsville has a strong economy, a diverse economy,'' he said.``That's not the source of our concern.''</TEXT></DOC>
