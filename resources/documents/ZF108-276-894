 So I'm happy to report that you can significantlyimprove upon the Windows-supplied screen fonts by generating your own, usingthe font outline packages and Installation Kits put out by Bitstream.andP;  Ifyou're fussy (like me), you can even hand-edit the Bitstream screen fonts byproducing them from the outlines with SoftCraft's WYSIfonts and Font Editorprograms.andM;One necessary warning: after installing any of these non-Microsoft screenfonts, you must be sure to comment-out those lines in your WIN.INI file thatcontain the names of your original Windows fonts.andP;  Simply put a semicolon atthe beginning of each appropriate line.andP;  If you don't do this, the Microsoftfonts will take precedence over the ones you want to use.andM;The readability issue aside, however, it's worth looking more closely at someof the high-powered features that make Word for Windows so impressive.andM;MOUSE MERRY-GO-ROUNDandM;Graphical interface programs are by nature more hospitable to those who wouldrather use a mouse than a keyboard.andP;  Word for Windows is no exception: to dowithout the mouse you have some 194 keystroke-equivalent commands to learn,including such beauties as Ctrl-Shift-F12 to print a file.andM;But Word for Windows has done some intelligent things to silence the usualcomplaints of the keyboard curmudgeons.andP;  The latter often grouse that forcommonly needed formatting operations you must frequently move the mousepointer to a menu item and click, then click again to select a second-levelmenu, and then line up a paper-thin insertion point with a specific field andtype in a number.andP;  That's more work than typing a command.andM;Microsoft's answer to this is shown in Figure 1, in the form of a ribbon anda ruler.andP;  These are displayable strips above your text, and both arechock-full of easy-access formatting icons.andP;  You select a block of text, beit a single character or your whole document, and at the ribbon you caninstantly change its font, point size, and text attributes.andP;  You see theactual result of a change as soon as you deselect the marked area.andO;Additionally, double-clicking a hot spot (a non-icon area) on the ribbonbrings up the full character-formatting dialogue box, which you couldotherwise select via the regular Format choices at the top of the screen.andM;Below the ribbon, the ruler similarly presents your paragraph-formattingchoices.andP;  Again, you can double-click a hot spot, bringing up the fullparagraph-format dialogue box.andP;  The ribbon and/or the ruler (as well as a25th-line status bar) can be displayed or not, so when you don't need themyou can see that many more lines of your text on the screen.andP;  Even a devoutcommand-line disciple must admit that for all but rarely issued formattingcommands, these make the mouse as easy to use as the keyboard.andM;MACROMANIAandM;Time was when the ability to save a selected portion of text, then get andinsert it anywhere in any document, was a marvel.andP;  Today, text macros aresupported by all but the most primitive editors.andP;  Next came the ability toinclude program commands within macros, so that with a keystroke or two youcould, for example, reduce the margins and switch to single-spacing for anindented quotation set in a double-spaced article.andP;  A comparable macro wouldthen return you to your normal formatting.andP;  Frankly, I suspect that for 90percent of all straight word-processing needs, this much macro flexibility isenough.andM;The remaining 10 percent, advanced macro needs, require the use of at leastsome programming tools: defined variables, GOTO label techniques, IF/THENstatements, Boolean operators, and the like.andP;  In recent years, heavy-dutyword processors such as XyWrite, WordPerfect, and Word have all addedprogramming language capabilities.andP;  Typically, these allow you to record thekeystrokes that enter the text and commands that make up your (usually short)program.andP;  When you edit (a kinder word than debug) such program macros, theircommands usually appear on-screen sandwiched between the chevron charactersandM;(andless;andless; andgt;andgt;).Word for Windows has taken the next logical step by making its advanced-macrofunctions a subset of QuickBASIC, known, appropriately, as WordBASIC.andP;  Thisgives it an ability to dimension arrays, create and interact with dialogboxes, use Case statements, and link the program dynamically with otherWindows-based applications.andP;  At the same time, a vastly expanded category offields has been added.andP;  A field is a coded instruction inserted into yourtext that can be updated as needed and accessed via the macro language.andM;All this adds enormous power--a new dimension, really--to what we have becomeaccustomed to thinking of as a macro programming language.andP;  At the same time,it tremendously steepens the learning curve.andP;  The discussion of fields alonetakes 21 pages in the program's User's Reference and another 44 in theTechnical Reference.andP;  But because fields are used for such everyday functionsas inserting &quot;Page x of y pages&quot; in a header or footer, you can't simplyignore them even if you have no need to index your documents or link them toother applications.andM;Moreover, in the process of adding so much advanced macro power, therelatively simple &quot;within the chevron&quot; macro-entry and -editing capabilitieshave been eliminated.andP;  When writing advanced WordPerfect macros, NeilRubenking regularly used to remind readers that, whether they knew it or not,they were actually writing short programs.andP;  For anything that goes beyondwhat you can record as a straightforward series of keystrokes, Word forWindows will leave you in no doubt about the matter!andP;  The power thatWordBASIC brings to word processing is impressive.andM;THE CASE FOR FRACTIONSandM;One relatively simple example of Word for Windows's macro language--and ofits use of field codes and graphics orientation--was submitted bymathematician and frequent contributor to PC Magazine Barry Simon, and isshown in Figure 2.andP;  In a character-based word processor, it's not easy toenter a fraction in which the numerator appears above the denominator with aline in between.andP;  You'd probably start by putting a hard return on the lineabove your fraction and a second return to create space for the numerator.andO;You'd then type a series of ASCII 196s (centered em dashes) for the divisorline, and terminate this line of type with two more hard returns.andP;  Then you'denter the numbers above and below the fraction line.andP;  You'd probably put thenumerator in subscript mode and the denominator in superscript mode so they'dcome closer to the line.andP;  More likely, you'd settle for typing 512/643 andforget about its appearance!andM;Simon's macro code is shown in the right-hand window of Figure 2, and theinstructions for using it are in the left-hand window.andP;  The results are farmore elegant and more easily obtained than you'd likely achieve with acharacter-based word processor.andP;  Because of its use of field codes, however,the macro must be entered in Macro Edit mode rather than as a simple seriesof recorded keystrokes.andP;  This is the point at which many word-processor userswho can informally program in their application's macro language will find itnecessary to grow beyond their previous limits.andP;  Rest assured that the finalresults will be well worth the additional effort.andM;DASH IT ALLandM;Another tip suggested by Simon was to make a glossary entry to select thekind of dash you need--a hyphen/minus sign, an en dash, or an em dash--bysuccessively pressing a single key (F3).andM;To create the glossary entries, start with a fresh document, turn NumLock on,hold down the Alt key, and type in 0151.andP;  Select the character that isdisplayed on the screen (a medium-size en dash) and invoke Glossary from theEdit menu.andP;  Name the glossary entry -, using the minus sign (hyphen).andP;  Next,enter Alt+0150 in the document, select it, and name the macro Alt+0151.andP;  Thisname will display in the Name dialog as a box, but it will really be an endash.andP;  Finally, type a regular minus sign in the document, select it, anddefine it as the glossary entry Alt+0150.andP;  Now Save All from the file menu.andM;Now when the cursor is just to the right of a hyphen or minus sign in yourdocument (normally, just after you've typed it), the Glossary key (F3) willsuccessively cycle among the three choices.andP;  You could use a similar schemefor cycling through the four kinds of smart quotes.andP;  This obviates the taskof trying to remember the code numbers in the ANSI character set used byWindows.andP;  While the differences between the three successive entries will notshow up in Display Mode, with regular typefaces the improvement adds a veryprofessional touch, both on-screen and at the printer output.andM;TIPS FROM WORKINGandM;WORDSMITHSandM;Tell us your latest word-processing tips and we'll pay you $50 for any weprint.andP;
