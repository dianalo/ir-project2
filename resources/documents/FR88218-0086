These guidelines were published for a 60-day comment periodon March 10, 1986. Comments received during the comment period were reviewedand revisions have been made. Federal agencies should follow these guidelinesin establishing, monitoring, reviewing and evaluating their programs forcompliance with section 110 of the Act. State Historic Preservation Officersshould refer to these guidelines when providing assistance to Federal agenciesunder Sections 101(b)(3)(E) and (F) of the Act. The Advisory Council onHistoric Preservation will use these guidelines, as applicable, and recommendtheir use to Federal agencies, State Historic Preservation Officer, andothers, in agreements executed pursuant to Section 106 of the Act and 36CFR Part 800. The Council will also use these guidelines in its reviewof Federal agency programs under Section 202(a)(6) of the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>These Guidelines are effective February 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>de Teel Patterson Tiller, InteragencyResources Division, National Park Service, United States Department ofthe Interior, P.O. Box 3127, Washington, DC 20013-7127.The originator of these guidelines is Stephen M. Sheffield, United StatesDepartment of the Interior, in consultation with Thomas F. King, AdvisoryCouncil on Historic Preservation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The National Park Service received34 comments on the March 10, 1986, proposed Guidelines. Following reviewof these comments, the document was considerably revised and then circulatedin April of 1987 to all State Historic Preservation Officers, Federal PreservationOfficers, and all others who commented on the March 10 publication.Although the basic approach of the guidelines as described in the Introduction(Part 1) has not changed, and most of the substantive guidance remainsthe same, the document has undergone a major reorganization. Also, in clarifyingthe information in the guidelines, it has been necessary to add considerablyto the body of the document. Because of this considerable reorganizationand clarification, the National Park Service interested parties in April.The Service received 33 comments on the April draft, most of which suggestedonly minor changes to the document. Necessary changes have been made, andthe Service is satisfied that the guidelines are generally acceptable toFederal and State officials and other interested parties. The publishedfinal version does not differ significantly from the April draft.The following is a general discussion of how this final version differsfrom the March 10 proposed guidelines.The March 10 proposal was organized along the lines of the <T3>Secretary's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation(Secretary's Standards), </T3>using the broad activities of planning, identification,evaluation, registration, and treatment as an outline. This approach waschosen because of the strong relationship between the generic guidancepresented in the <T3>Secretary Standards </T3>and the more specific Federal agency directedguidance in the <T3>Section 110 Guidelines.</T3> Although the <T3>Secretary's Standards </T3>continues to be an important back-up documentto the <T3>Section 110 Guidelines, </T3>and Federal agencies need to refer toboth documents in carrying out their Section 110 responsibilities, manyof those commenting, particularly Federal agencies, found the organizationto be awkward, hard to follow, and difficult to relate to the requirementsin section 110 itself. This appeared to be particularly problemmatic forsmaller Federal agencies with limited responsibilities under section 110.In such cases, the agencies were aware of particular requirements in thelaw, but had difficulty finding guidance for them in the proposed document.It was widely suggested that presentation of the guidelines in the orderof the specific requirements in section 110 would facilitate their use.This has been done. Each subsection of section 110 is addressed individually.Further, categories of information are presented within the discussionof each subsection. First, under <T3>Requirement, </T3>the subsection is stated verbatim from the Act. Aparagraph describing the types of Federal agencies to which the requirementsapplies is entitled <T3>Applicability. </T3>Next is a <T3>Discussion </T3>section with detailed advice to agencies on implementingthe requirement. Each summary ends with a category on <T3>Related Requirements and Guidance </T3>in which are listed regulations,guidelines, technical assistance, and other publications which either directlyor indirectly bear on the requirements in the subsection being summarized.Many comments indicated concern that the March 10 document was not prescriptiveenough in describing Federal agencies' responsibilities under Section 110of the Act. Many commenters suggested that the Guidelines watered downthe requirements of the Act by suggesting agency actions rather than requiringthem. The National Park Service believes that these commenters are misinterpretingthe authorization given to the Secretary in section 101(f) of the Act.Section 101(f) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue guidancefor section 110. It does not authorize the Secretary to regulate the implementationof section 110. The guidelines do repeat the requirements of section 110and related authorities, such as sections 106 and 111, but their primarypurpose is to provide recommendations and options for agencies to considerin implementing these requirements.Many commenters suggested that the Guidelines blurred the distinction betweenthe requirements in section 110 and the requirement in section 106 of theAct that agencies consider the effects of their actions on historic properties.References to section 106 where appropriate have been included in thisfinal version of the Guidelines to clarify the relationship between thetwo sections.In addition to the revisions discussed above, numerous minor revisionsand additions have been made.Issued by the Secretary of the Interior.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: November 25, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary, Fish and Wildlife and Parks.</ITAG>Adopted by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation for use, as applicable,in agreements executed pursuant to section 106 of the Act and 36 CFR Part800 and in Advisory Council reviews of Federal agency programs under Section202(a)(6) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 2, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Cynthia Grassby Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Chairman, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Section 101(f) of the National Historic PreservationAct, 16 U.S.C. 470a(f).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">The Section 110 Guidelines: Guidelines for Federal Agency ResponsibilitiesUnder Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act</ITAG>Contents<ITAG tagnum="26">Part I.

Introduction</ITAG>Subsection 101(f) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, asamended, (``the Act'') authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in consultationwith the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, to promulgate guidelinesfor Federal agency responsibilities under section 110 of the Act. Section110 prescribes general and specific responsibilities of Federal agenciesin the identification, evaluation, registration, and protection of propertiesof historic, archeological, architectural, engineering, or cultural significance.<T3>The Section 110 Guidelines: Guidelines for Federal Agency Responsibilitiesunder Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 110Guidelines) </T3>describe the qualities of an effective and efficient agencyhistoric preservation program designed to ensure that the requirementsof Section 110 are met. They assist agencies in carrying out their missions,programs, and projects in a manner consistent with the requirements andpurposes of Section 110 of the Act, existing regulations, and the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeologyand Historic Preservation (Secretary's Standards). </T3>The <T3>Secretary's Standards </T3>were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>September 29, 1983; Vol. 48, No. 190, Part IV,pp. 44716-44740.The intent of section 110 is to ensure that historic preservation is fullyintegrated into the ongoing programs and missions of Federal agencies.It is expected that agencies will review their operating policies and procedures,taking into account applicable sections of these guidelines, in order toensure that such policies and procedures are consistent with the requirementsof section 110. For agencies whose missions seldom bring them into contactwith historic properties, use of these guidelines as the standard for historicresource management when such management is needed should be sufficient.For other agencies, such as those managing large tracts of land or administeringprograms that often affect historic properties, the guidelines can serveas a model for the development of historic preservation programs designedto serve particular agency needs. In either case, agencies should ensurethat the qualities of effective preservation described in these guidelinesare fully integrated into existing agency operations and management.A Federal agency may request the Secretary to review its implementationof the provisions of section 110 by contacting the Chief, Interagency ResourcesDivision, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, P.O.Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127. The Advisory Council on HistoricPreservation will use these guidelines during its reviews of Federal agencyprograms conducted under the authority in Section 202(a)(6) of the Act.The project and program standards and guidelines for implementing Section110 are the <T3>Secretary's Standards </T3>(48 FR 44716), prepared pursuant to 101(h)of the Act. They are the Secretary's performance standards for carryingout historic preservation activities, such as planning, identification,evaluation, documentation, and preservation, and are applicable to allusers, public and private. The <T3>Section 110 Guidelines </T3>are designed to assist agencies in usingthe <T3>Secretary's Standards </T3>and other pertinent guidance specific tohistoric preservation in the management programs they undertake pursuantto Section 110.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part II. Definitions</ITAG><T3>The Act</T3> means the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,as amended, 16 U.S.C. 470 <T3>et seq.</T3><T3>Advisory Council</T3> means the agency, fully titled the Advisory Councilon Historic Preservation, established pursuant to Title II of the Act,that is to be afforded a reasonable opportunity under Sections 106 and110(f) of the Act to comment with regard to proposed Federal, federallylicensed, or federally assisted undertakings which may affect propertieswhich are included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Registerof Historic Places, and that reviews Federal programs pursuant to Section202(a)(6) of the Act. Federal regulations, 36 CFR Part 800, ``Protectionof Historic Properties,'' outline the procedures for complying with therequirements of Section 106 of the Act.<T3>Agency Official</T3> means the head of any Federal agency, or designee,reponsible for program activities to which Section 110 pertains.<T3>Federal Preservation Officer (FPO)</T3> means the official, or designee,specifically responsible for coordinating an agency's activity under theAct.<T3>Historic Context</T3> means an organization format that groups historicproperties that share similarities of time, theme, and geography (e.g.,early 20th century cattle ranching in the panhandle of Oklahoma). Historiccontexts are linked to actual resources and are used by public and privateagencies and organizations to develop management plans based upon actualresource needs and information.<T3>Historic property</T3> or <T3>historic resource</T3> means any prehistoric or historic district,site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusionin, the National Register; such term includes artifacts, records, and remainswhich are related to such a district, site, building, structure, or object.<T3>Historic resource</T3> (see definition for ``historic property'').<T3>Indian tribe</T3> means the governing body of any Indian tribe, band,nation, or other group which is recognized as an Indian tribe by the Secretaryof the Interior for which the United States holds land in trust or restrictedstatus for the entity or its members.

Consultations </ITAG>Federal agencies should carry out their historic preservation activitiesin consultation with those governmental organizations with specific responsibilitiesunder section 110 and with organizations and individuals who can be expectedto be concerned about the agencies' preservation activities. In some cases,the involvement may be one of direct consultation and discussion. In othercases, it may be sufficient to notify interested persons and give theman opportunity to comment on agency preservation activities or decisions.The following describes the major parties with responsibilities and/orinterest in Federal agency historic preservation activities. <T3>The National Park Service</T3>. The Service is responsible for performingmany of the responsibilities specifically vested in the Secretary of theInterior under the Act. The Service maintains a large cultural resourcesprofessional staff with expertise in the broad range of historic preservationactivities authorized under the Act. Expertise can be located in the Service'sWashington and Regional Offices, National Parks, and various service centers.Agencies should contact the Associate Director for Cultural Resources,National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127 for sourcesof information when they have specific needs. <T3>SHPOs</T3>. Federal agencies are directed in section 110(a)(2) to cooperatewith SHPOs in establishing programs to locate, inventory and nominate historicproperties to the National Register. In cooperation with Federal agencies,SHPOs are responsible for directing and conducting a comprehensive statewidesurvey of historic properties and maintaining inventories of such propertiesunder Section 101(b)(3). These State officials maintain important informationon historic properties in inventories and in Comprehensive Statewide HistoricPreservation Plans, and are required to have qualified preservation professionalson staff. Federal agencies are advised to solicit their opinions and toseek their assistance in meeting Section 110 responsibilities and are requiredby 36 CFR Part 800 to do so in meeting their Section 106 responsibilities.Agencies are authorized by Section 110(g) to reimburse SHPOs for theirservices. Addresses of the SHPOs are available from the National Park Service.<T3>The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation</T3>. In carrying outits responsibilities under section 110, an agency may find it appropriateto consult with the Advisory Council in three ways. First, the AdvisoryCouncil produces guidance documents and other material concerning proceduresfor avoiding and mitigating adverse effects on historic properties thatmay be useful in section 110 program implementation. Second, many activitiescarried out pursuant to section 110 are also subject to review by the AdvisoryCouncil under section 106 of the Act and its implementing regulations (36CFR Part 800). Coordination with the Advisory Council during section 110program development may simplify or otherwise aid in fulfilling requirementsfor section 106 review of subsequent undertakings, particularly throughthe development of programmatic agreements. Third, the Advisory Councilhas the responsibility under section 202(a)(6) to review the policies andprograms of Federal agencies and recommend methods to improve the effectiveness,coordination, and consistency of these policies and programs with the policiesand programs carried out under the Act. Agencies may wish to seek suchreview in developing and improving their section 110 programs. <T3>Other Federal Agencies</T3>. An agency's section 110 activities shouldbe coordinated with those of other Federal agencies with overlapping jurisdictionover land or programs, that manage adjacent or nearby lands, or that haverelevant expertise. Significant efficiencies can be gained, for example,by pooling or otherwise sharing resources in the conduct of preservationplanning studies addressing land areas or historic property types underthe jurisdiction of multiple agencies. <T3>Local Governments</T3>. Agencies are urged to seek the opinions oflocal governments in carrying out their historic preservation responsibilitiesin specific local jurisdictions. Local governments may have considerablehistoric preservation capabilities and may maintain records that will assistagencies in the identification of historic properties. In addition, manylocal governments have sought greater participation in the national historicpreservation program and have been certified by the SHPO and the NationalPark Service as having certain preservation capabilities (see 36 CFR Part61, Approved State and Local Government Historic Preservation Programs.)A list of Certified Local Governments in each State can be obtained fromthe National Park Service or from the SHPO. <T3>Indian tribes and other Native American Groups</T3>. Under the regulationsimplementing the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, Indian tribesmust be notified prior to the issuance of permits that may result in harmto any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands. Applicableregulations are 36 CFR Part 296, issued by the Department of Agriculture;18 CFR Part 1312, issued by the Tennessee Valley Authority; 32 CFR Part229, issued by the Department of Defense; and 43 CFR Part 7, issued bythe Department of the Interior. Archeological sites and other historic properties sometimes are placesof continuing cultural interest to Indian tribes and other Native Americangroups, as the burial places of their ancestors, as places that figurein traditional history, and as places where rituals continue to be performedin connection with traditional religions. Such properties also may be eligiblefor listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Agencies shouldcoordinate their implementation of Section 110 so as to assure the treatmentand use of such properties occurs in a manner consistent with the intentand purposes of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. <T3>Non-Profit Organizations</T3>. Various non-profit organizations canprovide assistance to agencies. For example, organizations made up of professionalsin various disciplines can recommend professional services to agenciesand assist agencies in evaluating the capabilities of professionals inparticular fields. The same organizations can be helpful in ensuring qualitycontrol for federally contracted services. The National Trust for HistoricPreservation can provide agencies with information on State and local preservationlaws and activities. The Trust also can assist agencies in the resolutionof conflicts among public and private parties over preservation issuesat the State and local level. Statewide and local organizations may offerprofessional capabilities particularly valuable for work requiring understandingof state or local historic contexts. Other national, state, and local organizations,such as the Archeological Conservancy, statewide and local historic preservationorganizations, and academic institutions can provide assistance throughcooperative agreements with Federal agencies, as in the administrationof easements for lands turned over to third parties and can provide ongoingtechnical assistance. Lists of appropriate non-profit organizations canbe obtained from the SHPO. <T3>Other Interested Persons</T3>. In addition to the parties discussedabove, agencies will usually find considerable interest in their preservationactivities on the part of academic institutions, local preservation organizations,historical or archeological commissions, and others who promote historicpreservation. Such parties are typically anxious to cooperate with Federalagencies in activities that they view as protective of historic properties,and concerned about activities that they view as potentially destructive.Other parties who use Federal land for economic and recreational purposes,and those who receive Federal assistance or licenses that may be encumberedby preservation conditions, also have legitimate concerns about agencypreservation decisionmaking. Agencies should try to involve interestedpersons in the development and implementation of Section 110 programs,and give them the opportunity to participate in decisions that may affecttheir interests. <T3>The Public</T3>. Agencies should be sensitive to the interests of thegeneral public in the conduct of their preservation activities. Agenciesshould examine the administrative systems that structure their preservationprograms to see that they provide adequately for public participation.Public notice of agency plans and program activities should adequatelyinform the public of preservation issues in order to elicit public viewson such issues, that can then be considered and resolved, when possible,in decisionmaking. Members of the public with interests in historic preservationshould be given reasonable opportunities to comment on agency preservationprograms. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part IV. Subsection-by-Subsection Guidance</ITAG>The following is subsection-by-subsection guidance for section 110. Includedis a statement of the requirement taken directly from the Act, a statementabout the applicability of the requirement, a discussion concerning implementationof the requirement, and some suggested related guidance. Although specificrelated guidance is included subsection-by-subsection, agencies shouldconsult National Register Bulletin Number 25, <T3>Directory of Technical Assistance. </T3>The <T3>Directory, </T3>prepared to accompany the <T3>Secretary's Standards, </T3>contains a list of sources dealing withpreservation planning, identification, evaluation, registration, and protection.The <T3>Secretary's Standards, </T3>the <T3>Directory, </T3>and other information cited in the <T3>Section 110 Guidelines, </T3>are generally available from the InteragencyResources Division, National Park Service, United States Department ofthe Interior, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127, unless otherwisenoted. Information prepared by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservationand cited in the <T3>Section 110 Guidelines </T3>is available from the Advisory Councilon Historic Preservation, Old Post Office Building, 1100 Pennsylvania Ave.,NW. Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004.Section 110(a)(1)<T3>Requirement: </T3>``The heads of all Federal agencies shall assumeresponsibility for the preservation of historic properties which are ownedor controlled by such agency. Prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasingbuildings for purposes of carrying out agency responsibilities, each Federalagency shall use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties availableto the agency. Each agency shall undertake, consistent with the preservationof such properties and the mission of the agency and the professional standardsestablished pursuant to section 101(f), any preservation, as may be necessaryto carry out this section.''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(a)(1) applies to all Federal agenciesowning, acquiring, leasing or otherwise controlling properties.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The basic purpose of section 110(a)(1) is to causeagencies, when planning or carrying out their programs, to consider whetherthere are ways that the use of historic properties can be effectively integratedinto such programs so as to advance program purposes while preserving oreven enhancing the integrity of the properties.(a) <T3>Assuming responsibility. </T3>Section 110(a)(1) requires Federal agenciesto ``assume responsibility for the preservation of historic propertieswhich are owned or controlled by such agency.'' In order to assume suchresponsibility, an agency should:(1) Undertake a program to identify historic properties under its jurisdictionor control (see guidance for section 110(a)(2);(2) Maintain a management inventory of documentation developed in the identificationprogram for use in management, including an inventory of evaluated properties,information on properties that have not yet been evaluated, general backgrounddata, and information on the overall conduct and status of the identificationprogram (e.g., methods employed, areas inspected using various methods,areas likely to contain unidentified historic properties, etc.);(3) Integrate its management inventory with its systems for property management,land use planning, and project planning in order to identify opportunitiesfor the effective use and preservation of historic properties, identifypotential conflicts between preservation of historic properties and implementationof agency mission requirements, and identify areas where information isinsufficient to make planning decisions about historic properties, suggestingthe need for further study;(4) Consider the effects of proposed activities on historic propertiesearly in planning such activities;(5) Give thorough consideration to the use and re-use of historic propertiesfor agency program purposes as alternatives to the construction, acquisitionor leasing of new facilities and to the demolition of historic properties,taking into account the management factors in these guidelines; and,(6) Seek opportunities for cooperative efforts with other Federal agencies,State and local agencies, Indian tribes, and the private sector in thepreservation and use of historic properties.(b) <T3>Using properties. </T3>Section 110(a)(1) also requires agencies to``use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties available tothe agency.'' Agencies should use historic properties in a manner thatdoes not cause significant damage to or deterioration of the property.If the use of the property requires that the property be modified, suchmodifications should be consistent with the recommended treatments in the<T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for PreservationProjects.</T3>(1) To effectively use historic properties, agencies should:(i) Identify those program activities that presently involve the use ofhistoric properties and ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that suchactivities continue to maintain such properties in active use, providedthe activities are not causing damage to or deterioration of such properties;(ii) Identify those program activities that could use historic propertiesin ways that advance both agency purposes and preservation of the properties,and adjust such activities to the maximum extent possible to cause suchuse to occur; and,(iii) Whenever a new activity or program is planned, consider ways thatit could be designed in order to use historic properties to the maximumextent possible, and integrate such use into activity or program design.(2) Examples of the effective use of historic properties include:(i) Adaptation of a historic warehouse to provide office space;(ii) Cooperative use of a historic Federal office building for both officeand retail purposes; (iii) Integration of archeological sites into a military training scenario,so that they play the roles of training hazards (e.g., mine fields), thusprotecting them while enhancing the training activity; (iv) Maintaining the integrity of a historic agricultural landscape byencouraging continuing agricultural use; (v) Maintaining the integrity of historic structures on Federal lands bypermitting their adaptive use by private interests with appropriate controlsto ensure their preservation; (vi) Using artifacts, records, and remains that are part of historic propertiesfor purposes of research, public interpretation, and education; and, (vii) Leasing or exchanging historic properties or entering into contractsfor the management of such properties to enhance their preservation consistentwith the provisions of Section 111 of the Act. (3) <T3>Leasing, exchanging, and contracting for management of historic properties.</T3>(i) Section 111(a) of the Act authorizes Federal agencies, after consultationwith the Advisory Council (see 36 CFR Part 800) to lease historic propertiesunder their ownership to persons or organizations, or to exchange historicproperties for mutual benefit. The leasing provisions of Section 111(a)allow agencies to maintain ownership of historic properties to assure theircontinued preservation without necessitating direct agency use. In leasinghistoric properties, agencies should ensure that: (A) Proposed treatments and uses of the historic property are appropriateto the quality and significance of the resource; (B) Leases are prepared with the active participation of professionalsfrom appropriate preservation related disciplines, depending on the areasof significance of the properties being leased; (C) Treatments of properties are consistent with the <T3>Secretary's Standards and Gudelines for Preservation Projects;</T3>and, (D) The Advisory Council is consulted pursuant to Section 106 of the Actand its implementing regulations, 36 CFR Part 800. (ii) Section 111(b) also provides that the proceeds from any lease of ahistoric property may be retained by the agency and used to defray thecosts of administering, maintaining, reporting and otherwise preservingthe property or other agency-owned historic properties included on theNational Register. Any surplus leasing proceeds are to be deposited inthe U.S. Treasury at the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscalyear in which they were received. (iii) The National Park Service has implemented the leasing provision ofSection 111 as it applies to historic properties in National Parks andhas entered into programmatic memorandum of agreement with the AdvisoryCouncil to satisfy the review, comment, and consultation requirements ofsections 106 and 111 and 36 CFR Part 800. Further information concerninghow the Service is implementing the provisions of Section 111 can be obtainedfrom the Park Historic Architecture Division of the National Park Serviceand can also be found in 36 CFR Part 18, <T3>Leases and Exchanges of Historic Property. </T3>(iv) At the time of the development of these guidelines, few models existfor the exchange of historic properties under the authority of section111. In a few cases, the Bureau of Land Management has entered into agreementswith the Advisory Council and SHPOs under which it has disposed of difficult-to-manageland containing archeological sites of minor significance in return forland containing more significant sites. Although these agreements havebeen developed under the authority of section 106 of the Act without specificreference to section 111, they effectively implement the intent of section111. Information on such arrangements is available from the Advisory Council.(v) Agencies should be alert to opportunities for exchanges that will enhancethe Federal Government's ownership or management of historic properties.An agency might exchange a historic building that it could not use fora historic building that could be used for its program purposes, if theexchange would serve to ensure the continued preservation of both. An agencythat owns most of a historic district might exchange an isolated historicproperty, or a non-historic property, for a contributing part of the districtowned by another party, in order to make possible the preservation, interpretation,or adaptive use of the entire district. (vi) Section 111(c) allows Federal agencies having responsibility for themanagement of any historic property to enter into contracts for the managementof such property, provided that the agency has consulted with the AdvisoryCouncil and the contract contains terms and conditions deemed by the headof the agency to be necessary or appropriate to the protection of the interestsof the United States and to ensure adequate preservation of the property.Local governments and non-profit organizations may be good candidates forsuch management agreements. (c) <T3>Undertaking preservation.</T3> Section 110(a)(1) also requires agenciesto ``undertake, consistent with the preservation of such properties andthe mission of the agency and the professional standards established pursuantto section 101(f), any preservation, as may be necessary to carry out thissection.'' The Act defines ``preservation'' as including ``identification,evaluation, recordation, documentation, curation, acquisition, protection,management, rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization, maintenance, andreconstruction, or any combination of the foregoing activities.'' Preservationplans should be developed for historic property types that the agency knowsit has under its jurisdiction or control, or that are likely to exist onlands under its jurisdiction or control, consistent with the <T3>Secretary's Standards,</T3> developed under section 101(f) of the Act,and taking into account the management factors outlined in these guidelines.In managing historic properties, agencies should consider a variety offactors in addition to, but not in lieu of, the significant element orelements of the properties which qualify them for inclusion in the NationalRegister. The factors that agencies need to take into account are not constant;rather they vary depending on many considerations, including the generaland specific cultural interests of the public. (1) <T3>Management Factors. </T3>No abstract list of factors to be consideredin managing historic properties can be inclusive; some will always be uniqueto particular cases. The following factors, however, are appliable in virtuallyall cases.(i) <T3>Level of significance. </T3>Following the determination as to whetheror not a property is historic and the determination of its level of significance,an agency may want to consider the level of significance in managementdecisions about the property. Although agencies have a uniform standardof preservation responsibilities for all properties eligible for the NationalRegister under their ownership or control, special care should be takento ensure the preservation of designated NHLs. NHLs have been designatedby the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional valuein commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States. Enhancementof those qualities that give NHLs their special commemorative and illustrativeimportance is of special concern to the Federal Government. When consideringthe relative significance of historic properties beyond the distinctionof designated NHLs, agencies should consult the Comprehensive StatewideHistoric Preservation Plan to determine aspects of State significance,and conduct appropriate studies to ascertain the degree to which localinterests ascribe importance to particular properties.(ii) <T3>Multiple areas of significance. </T3>Properties may possess significancefor several reasons. For example, a property may be eligible for the NationalRegister for its architecture as well as being eligible for an associationwith an important historic event. Or, a property may possess significancebecause it is eligible for each of several historical associations. Themultiple sources of significance of a property may enhance its value.(iii) <T3>Kinds of values. </T3>The nature of a property's significance is abasic consideration in defining how the property should be treated. Historicproperties may possess all or some of the following values:(A) <T3>Interpretive value. </T3>Properties associated with people, groups,or processes significant in our past may have potential for public interpretationas exhibits-in-place or as sources of information for interpretation elsewhere.(B) <T3>Contribution to sense of time and place. </T3>Historic properties oftencontribute importantly to a community's, neighborhood's, or rural area'ssense of time and place. For example, a town's distinctive historic mainstreet may be central to defining the town's character; historic farmsmay be definitive of a rural landscape; the rowhouse architecture of anurban historic district may define the valued cultural environment of itsinhabitants. Some historic properties, because they are pleasing to theeye, make an important esthetic contribution to the local environment.(C) <T3>Research/information value. </T3>A property, its elements, or its featuresmay have the potential to reveal important information and fill researchneeds. Most archeological sites have such value, although research/informationvalue is not exclusively an archeological consideration. Buildings, structures,and other elements of the built environment may have historical, architectural,ethnographic, or sociological research value as well. Further discussionrelative to the research/information value of properties can be found inthe <T3>Secretary's Standards for Documentation.</T3>(D) <T3>Rare or typical examples. </T3>A historic property that is rare orunusual because there are few properties of its type extant, or becausethere are few with similar historical associations, or because the propertyexhibits unusual features (e.g., interior woodwork, method of construction),may be ascribed special value simply because of its rarity. On the otherhand, a property may be ascribed special value because it exemplifies atype, method of construction, settlement pattern, or economic system.(E) <T3>Sociocultural value. </T3>Some historic properties that are still usedfor their historical purposes, or for related purposes, have special socialand cultural significance to their users. Examples are sites and areasused by American Indians for traditional religious purposes, and historicdistricts that represent the living space of particular social or ethnicgroups.(iv) <T3>Integrity. </T3>Integrity is a measure of a property's authenticityand is evidenced by the survival of physical characteristics that existedduring the property's period of significance. Intergrity is a matter ofconcern with reference to those characteristics of a property that maymake it eligible for the National Register. If, for example, a buildingis significant primarily for its exterior architectural detailing, andit has been stripped of most of its exterior elements as part of structuralimprovements, it may have lost its integrity, even though it might be insound structural condition. Similarly, if an archeological site is importantprimarily for the information contained in stratigraphic relationshipsamong artifacts, other objects, and soil layers, and these relationshipshave been seriously distorted through natural or human land disturbance,the site may have lost its integrity. It should be noted in judging integrity,however, that sometimes the changes a property has undergone may themselvesbe of historical or architectural interest, and that even disturbed archeologicalcontexts can sometimes yield useful information.(v) <T3>Condition. </T3>The different conditions of resources require differentmanagement decisions and techniques. Whatever its historical integrity,a property that is in relatively good condition will be easier to maintainor rehabilitate than one that is in relatively poor condition (see <T3>Secretary's Standards for Preservation Projects, </T3>also found in36 CFR Part 68).(vi) <T3>Cost to maintain/operate the property. </T3>The short-term and long-termcosts of programmatic and property-specific resource management strategiesshould be fully considered. For example, historic structures that requiresmaller investments to maintain and operate may prove cost effective tomanage through rehabilitation or adaptive use, whereas other structureswith higher operating costs may not. The relative cost of various managementstrategies for a historic property, perhaps ranging from full rehabilitationand adaptive use to demolition and replacement with a modern building,should be carefully and objectively considered, with reference to the pertinentrequirements of Executive Order 11912, as amended, to the pertinent criteriaestablished in OMB Circular A-94, and to the pertinent principles and methodsset forth in the National Bureau of Standards <T3>Life-Cycle Costing Manual </T3>(NBS Handbook 135).Applicable long- and short-term maintenance costs should be carefully consideredas part of any cost analysis. It is often the case that the short-termcosts of preserving a historic structure are balanced by long-term savingsin maintenance or replacement; on the other hand, failure to perform neededcyclic maintenance may shorten the life of a building and decrease thevalue of investment in its rehabilitation.(vii) <T3>Existing use or potential re-use.</T3> Whether a historic propertynow serves, or could serve, the contemporary or future purposes of theagency or others is an important consideration in establishing managementpriorities. For example, when historic properties are used for administrativeoffices or housing in a manner that does not destroy their integrity, suchuse serves both preservation and contemporary management needs.(2) Factors to consider in managing historic properties will vary dependingon the mission of the agency, its needs, and the money available for preservation.Although approaches will necessarily vary from agency to agency, each canaggressively carry out the requirement to undertake preservation. An agencymay choose to make a substantial investment in order to preserve an NHLthat is in poor condition, while another agency may make the same investmentto preserve a dozen other historic propeties which are in good condition.Some agencies will have more historic properties available for adaptiveuse than they can actually use. In such cases, consideration of the condition,significance, integrity, and maintenance costs will be weighed heavilyin determining management priorities.(3) As part of its historic preservation program, each agency should developa system that considers the factors described in these guidelines. Thesystem should be straightforward and easy to carry out. Although the systemshould allow the agency to set realistic priorities, recognizing that idealpreservation is not always affordable, it should not be designed to justifyagency avoidance of its historic preservation responsibilities under theAct. The agency's system, if thoughtfully developed and implemented, shouldcontribute to an aggressive Federal effort to preserve historic propertieswhile being cost-effective and compatible with the agency's mission.(4) <T3>Preservation in place.</T3> Generally, historic properties should bepreserved on their original sites. This rule, of course, does not applyto properties that are inherently mobile, such as ships and airplanes.Usually immobile buildings and structures may be moved, and archeologicalproperties removed from their orginal sites, under certain conditions asdiscussed below.(i) <T3>Buildings and structures.</T3> Historic buildings and structures shouldbe moved only when there is no feasible alternative for preservation. Whensuch a property is moved, every effort should be made to reestablish itshistoric orientation, immediate setting and general environment. Wherethere is no alternative to relocating a historic building or structure,it should be moved in accordance with National Park Service guidance (SeeRelated Requirements and Guidance following this discussion of Section110(a)(1)), and consistent with National Register procedures, 30 CFR Part60. Where it is feasible to maintain a building on its original site, thecost and management responsibility of preserving the building needs tobe considered relative to the cost and effort of moving it and other consequences,such as the subsequent need to relocate a construction or land-use project.(ii) <T3>Archeological sites.</T3> Preservation in place is also usually thepreferred approach with respect to archeological sites, but in some casesit is more appropriate to excavate all or part of a site, thus relocatingsome of the materials it contains and translating some of the informationit contains into written or other forms for future reference. As an example,in balancing the need for preservation of an archeological site in placeagainst other needs, agencies should consider:(A) Whether leaving the site in place will actually preserve it (i.e.,will the site be vulnerable to adverse effects, such as vandalism or erosion);(B) Whether there is a compelling reason to excavate the site for its researchvalue (i.e., can study of the site answer a research question sufficientin content to justify sacrificing the undocumented portion of the site);(C) The cost and management responsibility of preserving the site in placerelative to the cost and effort of excavating it (e.g., will leaving thesite in place require expensive relocation of a construction or land-useproject); and(D) Whether the site has values beyond those of archeological researchthat suggest the need for preservation (i.e., does it have interpretivepotential; does it possess important research values that cannot effectivelybe documented with present data recovery technology; or is it a site ofcultural importance to the descendants of those who created it?).(5) <T3>Management of artifacts, records or remains.</T3> Where an agency hasmanagement responsibility for archeological artifacts, records, or remainsrelated to a historic property but no longer physically present withinthe property, these should be cared for in accordance with the requirementsin 36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collection</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register,</T4> 52 FR 32740).

In carrying out this requirement, the agency,in consultation with the SHPO, should:(i) Conduct background studies, field surveys and analyses to identifyand evaluate properties against National Register criteria and nominateeligible properties consistent with the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Planning,Identification, Evaluation, and Registration</T3>, the National Registerregulations, 36 CFR Part 60, and appropriate National Register Bulletins(see Related Requirements and Guidance following this discussion of section110(a)(2)).(ii) Seek and consider the views of other Federal agencies, local governments,Indian tribes, and other interested persons in the development and maintenanceof the agency's historic preservation planning, inventory, evaluation andnomination program; (iii) Ensure that identification, evaluation and registration routinelyaddress the full range of historic property types likely to be present.(iv) Give priority consideration for survey, evaluation, and registrationto areas in which the agency has proposed undertakings or where threatsto the resources from other factors, such as significant deteriorationor vandalism, have been identified;(v) Include as a priority the survey, evaluation, and registration of areaswhere the agency lacks sufficient information about historic propertiesto permit effective long-range planning and protection efforts;(vi) Provide for the identification, evaluation and registration of historicproperties prior to acquiring lands, especially if acquired for constructionor alteration;(vii) Coordinate identification, evaluation, and registration activitiesconsistent with the Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Planand the statewide inventory carried out by each SHPO, with similar effortscarried out by other Federal, State and local agencies, and with identificationprograms carried out to meet the requirements of section 106 of the Actand implementing regulations, 36 CFR Part 800; and(vii) Consider the possible advantages of using their programs, where applicable,as the bases for programmatic agreements with the Advisory Council to facilitatecompliance with section 106 of the Act (See 36 CFR 800.13).(3) <T3>Agency programs involving general land use planning. </T3>Where anagency is involved in overall urban or rural land use planning, its programto locate, inventory, and nominate historic properties should be integratedwith the development, refinement, and implementation of such planning.Background studies and field reconnaissance should be used to generateinitial predictions about the location and nature of historic properties,as discussed in (b)(2)(ii) of the guidance for this section. Such predictionscan be used as bases for zoning and other forms of land-use control, andas guides for more location-specific identification and planning activities.(4) <T3>Agency programs involving large-scale projects. </T3>Where agenciesare involved in planning, permitting, assisting, or carrying out projectsthat affect relatively large areas (e.g., long pipelines, surface mines,timber sales, military training exercises, etc.), a historic preservationplan might be developed for each such project, for multiple projects ina given region, or for a particular type of project, to guide location,inventory, nomination, and consideration of historic properties in projectplanning and implementation. Development of such plans should be coordinatedwith relevant SHPOs, the Advisory Council, and if applicable other interestedpersons in order to facilitate review under section 106 of the Act. (5) <T3>Agency programs involving small scale projects. </T3>Where agenciesare involved in planning, permitting, assisting or carrying out projectsthat affect relatively small areas (e.g., construction of single buildings,short pipelines, short segments of highway, etc.), the responsible agencyshould consult with the SHPO and other knowledgable parties to determine(a) whether historic properties are known or expected to occur within thearea(s) subject to direct or indirect effect by the project, and (b) whatkinds of further identification and evaluation efforts may be appropriate.Generally, background research and field survey conducted in accordancewith the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Identification</T3>are appropriate where areas subject to effect have not been surveyedin the past, unless reliable data indicate that it is very unlikely thathistoric properties will be found in such areas. Where poorly defined areasare involved, such as where project effects are indirect and difficultto predict, it may be feasible only to generate and test a predictive modelbased on background research and reconnaissance survey, but sufficientstudy should be done to provide a basis for decisionmaking about the effectsof the project and about possible mitigation measures. (6) <T3>Buildings management programs. </T3>(i) Where agencies are involvedin the management of buildings, a systematic inventory of such buildingsshould be conducted, in a manner consistent with the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Identificationand Evaluation, </T3>applying the National Register criteria found in 36CFR Part 60 to each building or group of buildings to determine its eligibilityfor the National Register. Such inventories can be phased over a numberof years, but in any event each building should be evaluated well beforea decision is made about demolition or substantial alteration so the agencycan carry out its responsibilities under sections 110(a)(2), 110(b), and106, and 36 CFR Part 800 in a timely manner. (ii) When considering the significance of a building, the surroundingsof the building should be considered as well. For example, if a buildingis in a historic district, it should be evaluated in the context of thedistrict as a whole. If the building is part of a group of buildings thatform a cohesive whole, but have not been recognized as a district, thepossibility that they are eligible for the National Register as a districtshould be considered. (iii) Although buildings may most often be determined eligible for theNational Register because of their historic associations or architecturalqualities, the information they may contain about the past should alsobe considered. Such information may be contained, for example, in evidenceof construction techniques, in a building's fittings and internal organization,and in the furniture and documents it may contain. The possibility thatimportant archeological deposits exist under or around buildings shouldalso be taken into account. (b) <T3>Location and Inventory. </T3>In locating, evaluating and adding propertiesto the management inventory, agencies should consult the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Identificationand Evaluation. </T3>As a first step in the process, agencies should determine,in consultation with the SHPO, if surveys have been conducted and, if so,consult those survey reports. (1) <T3>Existing inventories. </T3>In addition to area-specific reports thatthe SHPO may provide or recommend, sources of information on historic propertiesalready identified include: (i) <T3>The National Register of Historic Places. </T3>The Secretary maintainsthis list of properties of national, State and local significance. Detailedinformation concerning the boundaries of historic properties listed in,or determined eligible for, the National Register can be obtained fromthe SHPO. An automated National Register Information System is scheduledfor testing in FY 1987, and for general on-line access by State and Federalagencies in FY 1988. (ii) <T3>Historic American Buildings Survey and Historic American EngineeringRecord (HABS/HAER). </T3>HABS/HAER catalogues maintained by the Libraryof Congress contain historical and architectural information on buildingsand structures that have been recorded by the National Park Service. Forinformation concerning access to the catalogues, agencies should contactthe Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress, Washington, DC20540. (iii) <T3>National Archeological Data Base (NADB). </T3>The NADB, maintainedby the National Park Service, includes bibliographical references to reportsprepared by and for Federal agencies, information on Federal agency projectsthat included archeological work, and names and locational informationon other archeological data bases, as well as other references to projectsnot actually funded by agencies. For information concerning access to theNADB, agencies should contact the Departmental Consulting Archeologist,United States Department of the Interior, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC20013-7127. (iv) <T3>Federal and State agency data bases. </T3>Many Federal and State agenciesthat manage land or buildings maintain inventories of known historic propertiesunder their control, or have historic preservation plans pertaining toparticular areas under their jurisdiction.   (v) <T3>State registers and inventories. </T3>Data from State registers orinventories of properties may be obtained from the appropriate SHPO. Inaddition to National Register properties, these State registers usuallyinclude other properties determined to be significant by the State andproperties that have not yet been evaluated.(vi) <T3>Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Plans. </T3>That ComprehensiveStatewide Historic Preservation Plan, maintained by the SHPO pursuant tosection 101(b)(3)(C), will assist in identifying historic contexts, propertytypes expected to represent those contexts, the significance of properties,and the State's preservation objectives for properties and property classes.(vii) <T3>Local government records. </T3>Many local governments maintain recordsthat may assist agencies in the identification of historic properties.(viii) <T3>Records of academic institutions, historical organizations and others.</T3>Museums, academic institutions, and historical and archeological societiesoften maintain data bases relevant to identification.(ix) <T3>Indian tribal records. </T3>Indian tribes sometimes maintain recordsof properties having cultural significance.(x) <T3>Non-inventory data sources.</T3> Particularly where large land areasare involved, several kinds of information not normally found in inventoriesmay be even more useful than existing inventories in developing an identificationprogram. The SHPO can direct agencies to relevant data sources including:(A) Ethnographic reports and local histories useful in identifying areaswhere prehistoric or early historic groups may have lived or carried onother activities that would produce historic properties;(B) Models developed by cultural geographers and anthropologists that canbe used in generating predictions about the distribution of historic properties;(C) Oral historical data collected from traditional cultural authoritiesby folklorists, cultural anthropologists, historians and other researchersthat may indicate how land in the area was used in the past, where particularactivities were carried out, and thus where different kinds of historicproperties may exist;(D) Interviews with local artifact collectors that may be useful in identifyingarcheological sites;(E) Aerial and satellite imaging data, soil maps, and data on the distributionof plant communities, raw materials used in prehistoric and early historiceconomic activities, and other environmental data that may be importantto the development of predictions about historic property distributions.(2) <T3>Surveys to identify unrecorded historic properties. </T3>If surveyreports, inventories, and non-inventory data indicate that the area understudy has been adequately surveyed to identify historic properties, orthat it can reliably be assumed that no historic properties exist in thearea, no further work should be necessary. If the data suggest that unrecordedhistoric properties may exist, the agency should proceed with field surveyto identify such properties.The scale of any field survey should be defined with reference to the agency'smanagement needs, as discussed in (a) of the guidance for this Section.Generally, however, the following activities are involved in conductinga survey:(i) <T3>Identifying historic contexts. </T3>Decisions about the identification,evaluation, registration and treatment of historic properties are bestmade within predermined historic contexts.(A) A historic context can be described as a particular historic themethat is further delineated by a time period and a geographic area. Forexample, a property associated with coal mining in the late 19th centuryin western Kentucky can be compared with other properties having the samehistoric context in making decisions about specific properties within thecontext.(B) Historic contexts are identified based on survey records, inventories,archival research and non-inventory data.(C) Agencies should adopt, where feasible, State developed historic contextsfor the identification and evaluation of historic properties. This willsave considerable time and effort and will ensure that the agency and theSHPO are operating under the same assumptions concerning the historic andarcheological significance of resources. Likewise, where Federal agencieshave developed historic contexts, they should provide information on thesecontexts to appropriate SHPOs for State use and incorporation into Stateplanning activities. The SHPO may also identify specific properties thatmight quality for inclusion in the National Register. State identifiedhistoric contexts and State plans are available from the appropriate SHPO.(ii) <T3>Predicting property types and locations. </T3>Based on historic contexts,it should be possible to predict where different kinds of historic propertiesmay exist within the study area. The accuracy of such predictions, oftenreferred to as predictive models, will vary depending on the quality andquality of information on which they are based. Allowance should alwaysbe made for the possible existence of unanticipated property types, perhapsrepresenting unanticipated historic contexts, in unexpected locations.Predictive modeling can be based on information that varies in qualityand quantity. It is therefore important that they be evaluated and verifiedthrough empirical field testing before they are used as a regular elementin agency decisionmaking. Field testing can employ sampling techniquesto evalute and verify predictive models efficiently. Once a predictivemodel has been verified, it can be used as a basis for stratifying thesurvey area into zones of probability and as a basis for evaluating thesignificance of properties and for developing appropriate treatment strategies.(iii) <T3>Considering factors that may disguise historic properties. </T3>Agenciesshould take into account factors that may may mask or disguise historicproperties, for example the attachment of more recent facades to olderbuildings, the burial of archeological sites under fill dirt or older sediment,and the fact that some historic activities, such as some American Indianreligious-cultural practices, may have left little or no trace on the land.(iv) <T3>Type and method of survey. </T3>Based on the above factors and theagency's program needs discussed in (a) of the guidance for this Section,agencies should determine the type of survey to be conducted and any specialmethods to use. Fieldwork should be conducted in accordance with the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Identification </T3>and, if applicable, 36CFR 800.4. The selection of a method for a specific survey will be basedon a variety of factors including size of the area to be surveyed, thegeology and geography of the area, the types and number of historic propertiesknown and anticipated, the degree of vegetative cover, the degree of landdisturbance, and agency management objectives. The reliability of alternativesurvey strategies should be evaluated in consultation with the SHIPO. Severalsources of information on predictive modeling and survey methods are referencedunder Related Requirements and Guidance following this discussion. (v) <T3>Conducting timely surveys. </T3>Agencies should select appropriatestrategies to ensure that surveys are completed so that the agency cancarry out its responsibilities under Section 106 of the Act and 36 CFRPart 800 before initiating any activity that might damage or disturb historicproperties. (vi) <T3>Applying the National Register criteria. </T3>As a basis for nominatingproperties to the Secretary, agencies must apply the National Registercriteria in evaluating identified properties. Evaluations should be madeconsistent with the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Evaluation.</T3>(vii) <T3>Preparing the report of the survey results. </T3>(A) Agencies shouldprepare a report on survey results, both negative and positive, fully documentingthe rationale for decisions made in the identification and evaluation ofproperties. The inclusion of negative data_that is, on surveys that resultin the identification of no historic properties_is important to ensurethat redundant surveys will not be performed in the future. Negative dataalso are needed to improve the reliability of predictive models. (B) Agencies should provide such reports to the SHIPO and other interestedparties for review, comment, and incorporation into statewise historicresource inventories, and for use in reviews under Section 106 of the Actwhen applicable. Such reporting to the State assists the State in maintainingcomprehensive inventories while ensuring that State and Federal effortsare coordinated and compatible. Modification of reports, and sometimesadditional fieldwork, may be appropriate based on review comments. Historicproperties should be reported in a manner that facilitates their incorporationinto State inventories. Information should be restricted if it is determinedthat disclosure might create a threat (see discussion of <T3>Disclosure of sensitive information </T3>in the guidance for this section).(viii) <T3>Synthesizing reports. </T3>Where large-scale surveys are conducted,or smaller scale surveys over time result in the accumulation of substantialbodies of survey data about a given area, agencies should prepare reportssynthesizing and analyzing the resulting data for use by interested scholarsas well as for management purposes. Such syntheses should be provided toSHIPOs and other interested parties for review, comment, and incorporationinto inventories. (3) <T3>Properties that may become eligible in the future. </T3>In conductingsurveys, agencies may encounter properties that are potentially eligiblefor the National Register, but that do not meet the criteria at the timeof the survey. For example, properties may be less than 50 years old andnot of exceptional significance and, therefore, would not meet the NationalRegister criteria. If such properties are likely to become eligible inthe future, it is to the agency's advantage to document them at the timeof survey to facilitate later evaluation and registration. (4) <T3>Properties on Indian lands or important to Indian tribes. </T3>Whenidentification takes place on Indian lands, on lands to which Indian tribesretain residual rights or on lands used by Indian tribes, agencies shouldconsult with the governing body of the appropriate tribe. Agencies alsomay find that useful historic resource information can be obtained fromtraditional cultural authorities. Although such authorities may not bepart of the official governing body, they may be particularly knowledgablewith respect to properties on lands formerly used by tribes, propertiesthat may have continuing cultural importance to a tribe, and archeologicalsites respresenting a tribe's history or prehistory. (5) <T3>Submerged lands. </T3>For submerged lands, documentary and field researchmay serve to indicate the need for physical and/or electronic surveys forsubmerged archeological sites or sunken vessels. The Department of theInterior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) has developed an extensiveprogram dealing exclusively with the submerged resources of the Outer ContinentalShelf. The Program is detailed in the MMS publication <T3>Handbook for Archaeological Resource Protection.</T3> The bases ofthe program are the large-scale predictive models developed for each ofthe MMS regions. These models coupled with area-specific update analysesare used to determine whether site-specific surveys are necessary. A methodologyfor conducting large-scale deepwater surveys in the Gulf of Mexico hasbeen issued by the MMS and may be readily adapted to other affected areas.Additionally, studies developing and implementing methods for locatingsubmerged sites through coring procedures are available through the NationalPark Service and the MMS (See <T3>Related Requirements and Guidance</T3> for this section). Assistancein the conduct of smaller scale underwater examinations is available fromthe National Park Service's Southwest Cultural Resources Center, SubmergedCultural Resources Unit, P.O. Box 728, Santa Fe, NM 87501.Because of the specialized nature and problems attending underwater surveyactivities, agency officials may wish to review specific survey, inventory,and documentation procedures with the Departmental Consulting Archeologist,National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, P.O. Box37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127. Additional expertise is available fromthose SHPOs whose programs include underwater archeology.(6) <T3>Artifacts, Records, and Remains.</T3> Agencies should make an effortto document the current location and condition of artifacts, records andremains related to historic properties under their jurisdiction or control.In some cases, such as when objects have long been removed from their placesof origin, documentation, may not be feasible. Documentation should beincluded as appropriate in identification and evaluation records as wellas National Register property records.(7) <T3>Avoiding damage. </T3>Every effort should be made to ensure that thevalues and attributes of properties which make them eligible for the NationalRegister are not inadvertently damaged or destroyed during identificationand evaluation. For example, testing of archeological materials or archeologicalproperties during evaluation should be done in accordance with a researchdesign in a way that minimizes loss of archeological data and damage tothe property's integrity. Testing should not proceed beyond the point ofproviding sufficient information for evaluations of eligibility for theNational Register and for planning property management. The effects ofexcavations that proceed beyond this point must be reviewed under Section106 of the Act and 36 CFR Part 800. Agencies should consult with the SHPOwhen designating testing programs to ensure that they are not excessive.The Department of the Interior's Consulting Archeologist can also reviewtesting programs and advise agencies as to the appropriate standards.(8) <T3>Management inventory. </T3>Each agency should create a management inventoryof all known historic properties (whether or not they are listed in ordetermined eligible for the National Register) under its jurisdiction orcontrol, adding records of such properties as identified. Information onproperties added to the inventory should be provided to appropriate SHPOsfor addition to State inventories. Agencies are encouraged to use NationalRegister nomination form andplusmin;10-900 in maintaining historic propertyinventory information. Agencies may also want to consider using standardizedsurvey forms provided and used by the SHPO to make inventory informationconsistent with databases maintained by the SHPO. Although these formscan be augmented by other forms as the agency deems necessary, use of existingformats ensures that new inventory data are consistent with existing inventoriesand potentially available to as wide an audience as possible. In addition,each agency should maintain records of the results of identification andevaluation efforts, including:(i) A description of the methodology used for identification in each case(e.g., techniques used in observation of standing structures, surface inspection,subsurface testing, aerial photography, remote sensing, etc.);(ii) Information indicating what lands and properties under Federal jurisdictionor control have been surveyed and by whom, the type of survey employed,scaled, maps showing those areas or structures actually inspected duringthe surveys, a management inventory file containing documentation on allevaluated historic and non-historic properties, site photographs, and dataon areas where historic properties are not located;(iii) Information on methods used in evaluating properties;(iv) Records of sources and informants used in the identification and evaluation;and,(v) Documents prepared during the evaluation (e.g., inventory forms, recordsof consultations with SHPO and others).(9) <T3>Data bases. </T3>Agencies are encouraged to assist the Secretary, inhis cooperative effort with the Advisory Council and SHPOs, in undertakingand encouraging the development of statewide and regional data bases, comprehensivehistoric preservation planning, archeological and historical research designs,and management plans that will assist agencies in meeting the requirementsof Section 110(a)(2). Such cooperation will facilitate the developmentof a comprehensive body of information on potentially significant properties,level and type of survey coverage, the likelihood that historic propertieswill be found in various unsurveyed areas, and the bases for evaluatingnewly discovered properties. The automation of such inventories shouldbe done with reference to the National Register Information System dataelements and field definitions to ensure compatibility and coordinationamong other agencies. Data should also be capable of being converted intoASCII format for transferability to other data base management systems.(1) <T3>Disclosure of sensitive information. </T3>Under Section 304 of theAct, an agency shall not disclose information to the public relating tothe location or character of historic or archeological properties if theagency determines that the disclosure of such information may create asubstantial risk of harm, theft, or destruction to such properties or tothe area or place where such properties are located. In determining whetherand how to disclose information, an agency should balance the need to protectproperties from injury against the need to disclose information on suchproperties to those who may be concerned about, or have the responsibilityto comment upon, agency actions that may affect such properties. Whereboth needs exist, reports on historic properties should be organized sothat locational information can be withheld while descriptive informationand other data needed for planning and review purposes are disclosed. If,in specific cases, agencies need assistance in determining whether it isappropriate to disclose locational information, they should consult theSHPO or request the opinion of the Keeper of the National Register.(c) <T3>Nominations to the National Register. </T3>Agencies should nominateproperties found to be eligible for the National Register in accordancewith the procedures in 36 CFR Part 60, the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Registration</T3>, and National Park Servicetechnical information materials designed to assist in interpreting NationalRegister criteria.<T3>Multiple Property Registration Form. </T3>The Multiple Property RegistrationForm (NPS-10-900-b), when used in conjunction with the National Registerof Historic Places Registration Form (NPS-10-900), serves to consolidateand organize information on historic properties for listing or determinationsof eligibility for listing in the National Register. Agencies should usethe Multiple Property Registration Form to register a large group of historicproperties simultaneously, to establish a basis upon which to evaluatehistoric properties. This form replaces the multiple resource and thematicgroup formats previously used for registering properties related by geographyor theme but contains much of the same information these forms required.The Multiple Property Registration Form serves as a cover document thatincludes three major elements: the set of historic contexts the agencyintends to use in evaluating the significance of historic properties; theassociated property types within which historic properties under theirjurisdiction will be grouped; and the degree of historic integrity thatrelated properties must possess to qualify for listing in the NationalRegister or be determined eligible for listing. Registration documentationon types of properties should be prepared consistent with National RegisterBulletins (See Related Requirements and Guidance information followingthis discussion of Section 110(a)(2)).(d) <T3>Exercising caution. </T3>Section 110(a)(2) requires that agencies to``exercise caution'' to ensure that uninventoried historic properties andthose properties that have been identified but not yet evaluated or nominatedto the National Register are not adversely impacted or inadvertently transferred,sold, demolished, substantially altered or allowed to deteriorate significantly.Until an evaluation can be made, properties should be treated as thoughthey are eligible and managed accordingly.(1) In order to carry out this requirement, agencies should:(i) Establish maintenance plans for historic buildings and structures undertheir ownership or control that ensure their long-term preservation; trainmaintenance personnel in the use of such plans and appropriate maintenancetechniques and preservation treatments; and ensure that alterations toproperties that may be eligible for the National Register meet the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for PreservationProjects</T3>, and are reviewed in accordance with Section 106 of the Actand 36 CFR Part 800;(ii) Conduct necessary identification and evaluation efforts, in consultationwith the SHPO, and in accordance with Advisory Council procedures, 36 CFR800.4, for unidentified or unevaluated properties subject to effect byagency actions or in areas subject to damage from natural processes, vandalism,or other deterioration; and,(iii) Carefully consider known and potential threats to and effects onhistoric properties, including those resulting from planned agency actionsand those brought about by natural forces or vandalism. This considerationshould be carried out in accordance with Advisory Council regulations,36 CFR Part 800, and address:(A) Impacts that cause degradation and/or loss of those characteristicsthat make a property eligible for the National Register, including theintroduction of physical, visual, audible, or atmospheric elements thatare out of character with the property and its setting;(B) Adverse effects resulting from natural forces or vandalism;(C) Duration of adverse effects;(D) The impact of any proposed action upon the property;(E) The effects of disclosure of information to the public relating tothe location or character of properties that may be historic, particularlyarcheological sites (see (b)(11), <T3>Disclosure of sensitive information</T3> in this section).(F) Secondary or indirect impacts resulting from associated activitiesinduced or promoted by the proposed action on the property;(G) The relationship between local short-term uses of the property andthe long-term preservation and enhancement of the property, indicatingto what extent long-term consideration of preservation and enhancementare foreclosed by any proposed action; and,(H) The likelihood of unexpected discoveries of significant resources.Special consideration should be given to the likelihood that such discoverieswill be made after an agency's undertaking begins, particularly if environmentalconditions are such that it is impossible to identify all historic propertiesbefore the action begins (for example, where sediment accumulation mayhave buried archeological sites). In such cases, plans for handling discoveriesshould be developed in accordance with Advisory Council procedures, 36CFR 800.11(a), or provision made for entering into consultations with theSecretary under the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (Pub. L.93-291) in the event of an unexpected discovery. Public Law 93-291 willbe implemented in 36 CFR Part 66, <T3>Archeological and Historic Preservation Act; Department of the InteriorRegulations </T3>scheduled to be proposed in 1988.(2) <T3>Necessary actions. </T3>Based on the determination of effects, agenciesshould take the actions necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse effectson historic properties These actions should take into account the relevantmanagement factors (see guidance for Section 110(a)(1) of these guidelines)and be developed and reviewed under 36 CFR 800.5 and 800.6 of the AdvisoryCouncil's regulations. Appropriate actions may include:(i) Continued use or adaptive use of properties by Federal agencies;(ii) Making properties available to non-Federal parties for adaptive use;(iii) Design of projects to protect and enhance properties;(iv) Physical stabilization of properties;(v) Altering the property's environment to protect it (e.g., burying anarcheological site);(vi) Conducting detailed historic, architectural, and engineering documentationin accordance with the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Historical, Architectural, and EngineeringDocumentation;</T3>(vii) Archeological research to recover and analyze significant data andmaterials from threatened archeological sites in accordance with the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Archeological Documentation;</T3>(viii) Relocation of structures or objects (e.g., pieces of rock art),when preservation in place is not feasible, to a setting similar to thatof the original location;(ix) Salvage of architectural elements for exhibition or reuse;(x) Provision for publication or other dissemination of information gainedfrom identification, documentation, data recovery, and related activitiesin a manner that makes the information available for appropriate publicand management uses but does not result in the danger that historic propertieswill be vandalized or otherwise damanged;(xi) recordation and deposition of documentation in an appropriate repository(see guidance for section 110(b));(xii) curation of archeological artifacts, records, and remains relatedto historic properties but no longer physically present within the propertyin accordance with 36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register, </T4>52 FR 32740); and,(xiii) other preservation steps as may be necessary consistent with theestablished priorities of the agency as determined in consideration ofthe management factors outlined in these guidelines.<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: </T3>The following additional guidanceis recommended:<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for PreservationPlanning, Identification, Evaluation and Registration, </T3>48 FR 44716(See Introduction, Part I of these Guidelines, and the definition of the<T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>)<T3>The National Register of Historic Places. </T3>Names and addressesof properties listed in, or determined eligible for, the National Registeris published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>A cumulative list of properties was publishedin its entirety in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>February 6, 1979.

Although not directed under 110(b), agencies may require non-Federalparties with Federal licenses, permits, or other entitlements to conductactivities similar to those required in 110(b) under the authority of Section106 of the Act and Section 110(d).<T3>Discussion</T3>: (a) Section 110(b) requires agencies to ensure thathistoric properties subject to damage or other alteration by undertakingsthey conduct or assist are documented prior to such alteration. The <T3>Secretary's Standards for Architectural, Engineering, and ArcheologicalDocumentation </T3>provide documentation guidance that will assist agenciesin meeting this requirement. (1) <T3>Determining the need for recordation</T3>. In order to ``initiate stepsto assure that timely steps are taken to make or have made appropriaterecords,'' agencies should determine whether recordation is needed, and,if so, the appropriate level and kind of recordation necessary, in accordancewith established standards for property specific recordation in consultationwith the SHPO, Advisory Council, and other concerned parties under 36 CFRPart 800. Consultations with the Secretary under the Archeological andHistoric Preservation Act (Pub. L. 93-291) also may be appropriate to determinethe need for recordation. Pub. L. 93-291 will be implemented in 36 CFRPart 66, <T3>Archeological and Historic Preservation Act; Department of the InteriorRegulations</T3>, to be proposed by the Department of the Interior in 1988.The requirement in 110(b) also applies in cases when an agency proposesto dispose of or destroy artifacts, records, or remains related to a historicproperty. 36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register </T4>52 FR 32740), provides further information onrequirements for disposition or destruction of archeological materials.(2) <T3>Level and kind of documentation</T3>. The level and kind of documentationrequired under Section 110(b) vary depending on the nature of the property,its relative significance within identified historic context(s), and thenature of an undertaking's effects. For example, architectural recordingcan range from taking a few photographs to conducting a detailed programof photogrammetry or the preparation of measured drawings accompanied bya description of the building's materials, components, and constructiontechniques. Archeological data recovery can range from recording a site'ssurface features to conducting extensive excavation and detailed laboratoryanalysis. A single property may require more than one kind of recording.Architectural and engineering documentation will usually result in textreports, photographs and drawings. Archeological documentation will usuallyresult in descriptive, comparative, and analytical reports, and documentationrecords for objects. Oral historical documentation will normally resultin text reports, photographs, audio tapes and transcripts, and sometimesvideotapes. Documentation includes, but is not limited to:(i) Recording significant historical information about a property and thehistoric context(s) it represents;(ii) Recording significant architectural plans and features;(iii) Recording significant engineering details;(iv) Recording significant landscaping details;(v) Acquisition of significant oral historical information related to theproperty or its context;(vi) Archeological data recovery; and,(vii) Preserving original plans and specifications for historic buildings.(b) <T3>Repositories</T3>. Section 110(b) requires that documentation be depositedin the ``Library of Congress or with other appropriate agency as may bedesignated by the Secretary, for future use and reference.'' The Secretarymay designate appropriate agencies for the deposition of records when itis not appropriate to use the Library of Congress. Whenever records arefiled with the Library of Congress or an alternative repository, copiesof such records should be filed with the SHPO if that official so requests.For the following types of records, the Secretary has designated appropriatealternative repositories.(1) <T3>Architectural and engineering records</T3>_(i) <T3>HABS/HAER Collections in the Library of Congress</T3>. As a rule, andalways in the case of an NHL, architectural and engineering records, developedin accordance with the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Architectural and Engineering Documentation</T3>,should be deposited in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) Collectionor the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) Collection of the Libraryof Congress. Such records are to be first sent by the agency to the NationalPark Service where they will be processed for transmittal to the Libraryof Congress. Agencies should forward documentation to the Chief, HistoricAmerican Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record, NationalPark Service, United States Department of the Interior, Washington, DC20013-7127.(ii) <T3>Alternative repositories</T3>. An alternative repository, such as aState or local archive, may be used in lieu of the Library of Congressif an agency official, the SHPO, and the Advisory Council agree, throughthe process for compliance with section 106 of the Act and 36 CFR Part800, that the nature of a property of State or local significance and thenature of the necessary documentation so warrant.(2) <T3>Archeological records</T3>. Archeological records, including originalfield notes, photographs, computerized records, and other documents directlydescriptive of the work accomplished and its results, may be filed withthe National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian Institution, theSHPO, and/or appropriate academic institutions and museums pursuant toagreements reached in accordance with Section 106 of the Act and 36 CFRPart 800, in lieu of deposition with the Library of Congress. Agenciesshould ensure that the institution with which records are deposited meetsthe standards established under Section 101(a)(7)(A) of the Act and 36CFR Part 79. 36 CFR Part 79 (proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 52 FR 32740) will implement the provision ofthe Act requiring that significant prehistoric and historic artifacts,and associated records, be deposited in an institution with adequate long-termcuratorial capabilities. Until 36 CFR Part 79 is promulgated, agenciesshould consult with the Departmental Consulting Archeologist, United StatesDepartment of the Interior, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127 concerningappropriate depositories. Agencies should also consult with the DepartmentalConsulting Archeologist to determine what information would be appropriateto deposit with the National Archeological Data Base (see summary of section110(a)(2) for more description of National Archeological Data Base).(3) <T3>Oral historical records</T3>. Oral historical records, including originaltapes, transcripts, and field notes, should be filed with the Library ofCongress' American Folklife Center, with a similar regional repository,and/or with the State Folklorist. With the concurrence of the AmericanFolklife Center, alternative repositories agreed upon in accordance withSection 106 of the Act and 36 CFR Part 800 may be used in lieu of the Libraryof Congress.(c) For all projects, summary descriptive and analytic reports should bepublished, duplicated in manuscript form, or stored and made availableto researchers electronically or in microform. For projects of substantialscale, or where the research significance of recovered information otherwisewarrants, scholarly synthetic and analytical reports should always be published,either in professional journals or as separate monographs. Publicationof interpretive reports for the public, and preparation of interpretivefilms, videotapes, and slide shows are also recommended. Agencies are stronglyurged to deposit technical reports, such as historic structures reports,with the National Technical Information Service of the Department of Commerce.<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: </T3>The following additional guidanceis recommended:<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for HistoricalDocumentation</T3>, 48 FR 44728 (See Introduction, Part I of these Guidelines,and the definition of the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>)<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architecturaland Engineering Documentation</T3>, 48 FR 44730 (See Introduction, PartI of these Guidelines, and the definition of the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>)<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for ArcheologicalDocumentation</T3>, 48 FR 44734 (See Introduction, Part I of these Guidelines,and the definition of the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>)36 CFR Part 66, <T3>Archeological and Historic Preservation Act; Department of the InteriorRegulations</T3>. These regulations, to be proposed by the National ParkService in 1988, implement the Archeological and Historic PreservationAct (P.L. 93-291).36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 52 FR 32740). These regulations implement Federalcuratorial requirements of the Act and the Archaeological Resources ProtectionAct.36 CFR Part 800, <T3>Protection of Historic Properties</T3>. These regulations, issued bythe Advisory Council, implement the requirement in section 106 of the Actthat Federal agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historicproperties.<T3>Treatment of Archeological Properties. </T3>This publication, addressingthe broad range of treatments available for archeological properties, wasprepared by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.<T3>Preparing Agreement Documents. </T3>Published by the Advisory Council,this booklet describes suggested mitigation measures to be used in avoidingor minimizing adverse effects on historic properties.Section 110(c)<T3>Requirement: </T3>``The head of each Federal agency shall, unless exemptedunder section 214, designate a qualified official to be known as the agency's`preservation officer' who shall be responsible for coordinating that agency'sactivities under this Act. Each Preservation Officer may, in order to beconsidered qualified, satisfactorily complete an appropriate training programestablished by the Secretary under section 101(g).''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(c) applies to all Federal agencies,except those exempted by the Advisory Council under Section 214 of theAct. The Advisory Council set forth the procedures for exemptions in <T3>Guidelines for Exemptions under Section 214 of the National HistoricPreservation Act</T3>, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 18, 1982 (47 FR 46347-46348).<T3>Discussion: </T3>(a) <T3>Qualifications and Training. </T3>Agency officials designated as FederalPreservation Officers should have substantial experience administeringFederal historic preservation activities. It also is desirable that theFederal Preservation Officer meet the definition of professional (see PartII of these Guidelines). The Department of the Interior will, from timeto time, make available training to Federal Preservation Officers. Thistraining, which will be coordinated with the training efforts of otheragencies and organizations, including the Advisory Council's training programfor Federal agency Section 106 responsibilities, will be designed to addressall Federal agency historic preservation responsibilities mandated in theAct.(b) <T3>Position within agency structure</T3>. An FPO may have other agencyduties in addition to historic preservation coordination, depending onthe magnitude and degree of the agency's historic preservation activitiesand responsibilities. FPOs should have agencywide authority in order tocarry out their section 110 responsibilities effectively. In order to meetthe requirement for ``coordinating that agency's activities under thisAct,'' the FPO should occupy a position in the agency's organizationalstructure from which he or she can effectively monitor agency compliancewith the requirements of the Act. Administrative systems should be establishedto ensure that the FPO can review all agency activities that might affecthistoric properties. FPOs should be authorized to participate in the establishmentof identification and management procedures for historic properties, innominating properties to the National Register, in making National Registereligibility determinations, in consultations with the Advisory Counciland SHPOs, and in training agency staff with reference to their historicpreservation responsibilities.In agencies where significant preservation responsibilities rest with regionalor field offices, the agency head should appoint qualified FPOs at thoselevels. Such FPOs should ensure that their actions and conduct of historicpreservation activities are coordinated with, and consistent with, thoseof the central office FPO for that agency.(c) <T3>Use of professionals</T3>. It is expected that the FPO will be supportedby adequate professional staff, as needed. A Federal agency's historicpreservation program should be developed and implemented by or under thesupervision of qualified professionals in appropriate historic preservationdisciplines, although the use of paraprofessionals, students, and avocationalorganizations under professional supervision is encouraged in the implementationof the program.<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: </T3>The following additional guidanceis recommended:<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeologyand Historic Preservation, Professional Qualifications Standards</T3>,48 FR 44738 (See Introduction, Part I of these Guidelines, and the definitionof the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>).<T3>Guidelines for Exemptions under Section 214 of the National HistoricPreservation Act</T3>, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by the Advisory Council on October 18, 1982 (47FR 46347-46348).Section 110(d)<T3>Requirement: </T3>``Consistent with the agency's mission and mandates,all Federal agencies shall carry out agency programs and projects (includingthose under which any Federal assistance is provided or any Federal license,permit, or other approval is required) in accordance with the purposesof this Act and, give consideration to programs and projects which willfurther the purposes of this Act.''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(d) applies to all Federal agencies.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 110(d) requires that, consistent with theirmissions and mandates, all Federal agencies carry out their programs sothat historic preservation interests are affirmatively addressed. Althoughmost Federal agencies have a primary purpose other than historic preservation,it is reasonable to expect that they also view themselves as multiple resourcemanagers responding to diverse economic, social and environmental concerns_includinghistoric preservation.(a) <T3>Purposes of the Act. </T3>110(d) requires agencies to carry out programsand projects in accordance with the ``purposes of this Act.'' Section 2of the Act states that it ``shall be the policy of the Federal Government,in cooperation with other nations and in partnership with the States, localgovernments, Indian tribes, and private organizations and individuals to_(1) Use measures, including financial and technical assistance, to fosterconditions under which our modern society and our prehistoric resourcescan exist in productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic, and otherrequirements of present and future generations;(2) Provide leadership in the preservation of the prehistoric and historicresources of the United States and of the international community of nations;(3) Administer federally owned, administered, or controlled prehistoricand historic resources in a spirit of stewardship for the inspiration andbenefit of present and future generations;(4) Contribute to the preservation of non-federally owned prehistoric andhistoric resources and give maximum encouragement to organizations andindividuals undertaking preservation by private means;(5) Encourage the public and private preservation and utilization of allusable elements of the Nation's historic built environment; and,(6) Assist State and local governments and the National Trust for HistoricPreservation in the United States to expand and accelerate their historicpreservation programs and activities.''(b) <T3>Carrying out programs and projects. </T3>In order to meet the requirementto ``carry out agency programs and projects in accordance with the purposesof this Act'' consistent with the policy stated in Section 2 of the Act,agencies should ensure that their programs and projects will not conflictwith, and where possible will advance, the Act's purposes. Agencies should:(1) Solicit the opinions of SHPOs about Federal actions and plans thatmight affect historic properties;(2) Seek ways to harmonize their actions with the preservation of historicproperties, and put such properties to productive uses in the public interest;(3) Encourage others, including non-Federal agencies and foreign governmentswith which the agency interacts, to give due consideration to historicproperties;(4) Identify historic properties owned by the agency, and take appropriatesteps to protect, preserve, and rehabilitate them;(5) Ensure that agency actions, and the actions of those to whom the agencyprovides assistance, permits, licenses, or approvals, are preceded by effectiveplanning to identify and avoid effects to historic properties, or to mitigatethose effects if they are unavoidable;(6) Design agency programs and projects to foster the rehabilitation andappropriate use, including re-use, of historic buildings and structures;and,(7) Design agency programs and projects to foster the cost effective managementof historic properties.(c) <T3>Programs and projects to further the Act's purposes.</T3> In orderto ``give consideration to programs and projects which will further thepurposes of this Act,'' agencies should, whenever it is within their administrativediscretion (see section 110(g)), participate in programs specifically designedto advance the policy stated in Section 2 of the Act, such as:(1) Provision of financial and technical assistance to historic preservationactivities and to the adaptive use of historic properties;(2) Demonstration historic preservation projects and cooperative historicpreservation programs with non-Federal entities and foreign governments;(3) Special projects to study, document, and make productive use of historicproperties under the agency's ownership;(4) Cooperation with non-Federal entities in the identification, protection,study, documentation, and appropriate use of historic properties;(5) Use of agency programs and financial and technical assistance in therehabilitation and adaptive use of historic buildings and structures;(6) Use of agency programs and financial and technical assistance in theeffective utilization of archeological information; and,(7) Cooperative programs with SHPOs, local governments, and Indian tribes,if appropriate, in the identification, recording, study, documentation,and appropriate use of historic properties, specifically including cooperationwith the SHPOs in their development and maintenance of statewide inventoriesof historic properties and in their administration of the ComprehensiveStatewide Historic Preservation Plans.(d) <T3>Balancing mission and purposes of the Act. </T3>The requirement thatactions be made in accordance with the Act's purposes but also in a manner``consistent with the agency's mission and mandates'' means that agencies,in their decisionmaking, must balance historic preservation considerations,specifically those outlined in Section 2 of the Act, against any conflictingmission requirements. It is not the intent of Section 110(d) to make thepurposes of the Act paramount over other public interests.(1) <T3>Section 106 of the Act.</T3> One of the specific requirements thatcomplements the general requirement in section 110(d) of the Act is foundin section 106 of the Act. Compliance with section 106 of the Act and implementingregulations, 36 CFR Part 800, provides an important mechanism for balancingagency mission requirements and historic preservation with respect to agencyundertakings. In carrying out section 106 of the Act responsibilities,agencies should apply the standards and relevant sections of the section110 Guidelines. Under section 106 of the Act, Federal agencies having director indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal, federally licensed, orfederally assisted undertaking shall take into account the effect of theundertaking on any property that is included in or eligible for inclusionin the National Register. As part of this consideration, Federal agenciesmust provide the Advisory Council with a reasonable opportunity to commentwith regard to such undertaking. The procedures for complying with section106 of the Act are found in 36 CFR Part 800.(2) <T3>Section 202(a)(6) of the Act.</T3> With respect to entire agency programs,agencies are encouraged to seek the general assistance of the AdvisoryCouncil, which is authorized under section 202(a)(6) to ``review the policiesand programs of Federal agencies and recommend to such agencies methodsto improve the effectiveness, coordination, and consistency of those policiesand programs with the policies and programs carried out under this Act.''The Advisory Council will use the <T3>Section 110 Guidelines</T3> as a basis for evaluating relevant programareas.<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: </T3>The following additional guidanceis recommended:<T3>The Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeologyand Historic Preservation, </T3>48 FR 44716 (See Introduction, Part I ofthese Guidelines, and the definition of the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>)36 CFR Part 60, <T3>National Register of Historic Places. </T3>This regulation describesthe procedures for nominations to the National Register.36 CFR Part 800, <T3>Protection of Historic Properties. </T3>These regulations, issued bythe Advisory Council, implement the requirement in Section 106 of the Actthat Federal agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historicproperties.<T3>Section 106 Step by Step. </T3>Published by the Advisory Council, thisbooklet describes the procedures to be followed in complying with the requirementof Section 106 of the Act and implementing regulations 36 CFR Part 800.Section 110(e)<T3>Requirement: </T3>``The Secretary shall review and approve the plansof transferees of surplus federally owned historic properties not laterthan ninety days after his receipt of such plans to ensure that the prehistorical,historical, architectural, or culturally significant values will be preservedor enhanced.''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(e) applies to the Secretary of theInterior.<T3>Discussion: </T3>With respect to properties being transferred for historicmonument purposes, the regulations in 41 CFR 101-47.308-3 must be followed.Under these regulations, the Secretary determines whether an applicant'sproposed use of a property is compatible with its historic character, andapproves the applicant's architectural and financial plans for rehabilitation,restoration, and maintenance of the property. The Secretary also ensuresthat the grantee complies with the terms of a conveyance in perpetuity.Reviews by the Secretary under section 110(e) are to be conducted in complementwith, or prior to, the Advisory Council's review of the transfer proposalunder the requirement of section 106 of the Act.There is no corresponding regulatory requirement for the Secretary to reviewagencies' plans for historic properties that may be disposed of by meansother than that authorized by the historic monument provisions of the FederalProperty and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. However,the Secretary, when requested to review such plans, generally will adoptand approve the transferee's plans if such plans are the subject of a memorandumof agreement executed pursuant to 36 CFR Part 800. If no agreement is reachedbetween consulting parties as a result of the 36 CFR Part 800 process,the Secretary will follow the procedures established in accordance with41 CFR 101-47.308-3).<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance:</T3>41 CFR Part 101-47, <T3>Utilization and Disposal of Real Property (refer to subsection 101-47.308-3).</T3>40 U.S.C. 484(k)(3), <T3>Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended.</T3>Section 110(f) <T3>Requirement: </T3>``Prior to the approval of any Federal undertakingwhich may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark,the head of the responsible Federal agency shall, to the maximum extentpossible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimizeharm to such landmark, and shall afford the Advisory Council on HistoricPreservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking.''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(f) applies to all Federal agencieswhose undertakings may directly and adversely affect an NHL, whether suchproperty is on Federal or non-Federal land. <T3>Discussion: </T3>NHLs are designated by the Secretary under the authorityof the Historic Sites Act of 1935. The 1935 Act authorizes the Secretaryto identify historic and archeological sites, buildings, and objects which``possess exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating the historyof the United States.'' (a) <T3>Minimizing harm to NHLs. </T3>Section 110(f) of the Act further affirmsthe special meaning of these properties of national significance by requiringthat Federal agencies exercise a higher standard of care when consideringundertakings that may directly and adversely affect NHLs. In those rarecases when an agency's undertaking affects an NHL, and in order to meetthe requirement that agencies, ``to the maximum extent possible, undertakesuch planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to suchlandmark,'' agencies should make every possible effort to consider prudentand feasible alternatives to adversely affecting the NHL. The requirementin this section does not supersede the requirement in Section 106 of theAct, but complements it by setting a higher standard for agency planningin relationship to NHLs before the agency brings the matter to the AdvisoryCouncil. Since NHLs are valuable to the Nation for their ability to commemorateand illustrate its history, some management options commonly used withrespect to properties having State and local levels of significance underSection 106 of the Act, such as data recovery, documentation before demolition,and some kinds of adaptive use, may be inappropriate for the managementof NHLs. Agencies should seek to preserve NHLs in place and as unchangedas possible, so that the public can continue to appreciate them and thehistory they commemorate and illustrate. The requirement that Federal agenciestake into account the effects of their actions on properties of State andlocal significance is not in any way minimized or reduced because of theneed to exercise special care with respect to preserving the unique commemorativeand illustrative qualities of NHLs. Consistent with 110(f), agencies should seek prudent and feasible alternativesthat would avoid or minimize harm to an NHL. Where the alternatives maybe too costly or decrease the effectiveness of meeting the undertaking'sgoals and objectives, the agency is faced with the need to balance thesegoals and objectives with the intent of 110(f). In doing so, the agencyshould consider:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the magnitude of the undertaking's harm to the historical, archeologicaland cultural qualities of the NHL; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) the national significance of the qualities of the NHL; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) the public interest in the undertaking as proposed; and, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) the effect which a mitigation action would have on meeting thegoals and objectives of the undertaking.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Advisory Council section 106 provisions for NHLs. </T3>The AdvisoryCouncil has also included in its section 106 regulations, 36 CFR Part 800,specific provisions that implement section 110(f). Section 800.10 of theregulations provides that, in cases involving NHLs: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the Advisory Council shall be included in any consultation followinga determination by the Federal agency that a Federal or federally assistedundertaking will have an adverse effect on historic properties; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) the Advisory Council may reuqest the Secretary to provide a reportto the Council detailing the significance of the affected property, describingthe effects of the undertaking on the property, and recommending measuresto avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects; and, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) the Advisory Council shall report the outcome of the section 106process to the President, the Congress, the Secretary and the head of theagency responsible for the undertaking. </ITAG><T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: The Secretary of the Interior'sStandards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation, </T3>48FR 44716 (See Introduction, Part I of these Guidelines, and the definitionof the <T3>Secretary's Standards</T3>) 36 CFR Part 800, <T3>Protection of Historic Properties. </T3>These regulations, issued bythe Advisory Council, implement the requirement in section 106 of the Actthat Federal agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historicproperties. Section 110(g)<T3>Requirement: </T3>``Each Federal agency may include the costs of preservationactivities of such agency under this Act as eligible project costs in allundertakings of such agency or assisted by such agency. The eligible projectcosts may also include amounts paid by a Federal agency to any State tobe used in carrying out such preservation responsibilities of the Federalagency under this Act, and reasonable costs may be charged to Federal licenseesand permittees as a condition to the issuance of such license or permit.''<T3>Applicability: </T3>Section 110(g) applies to all Federal agenciesincurring costs of preservation activities, and to all agencies that issuelicenses or permits.<T3>Discussion: </T3>(a) <T3>Reasonable preservation costs. </T3>The intent of section 110(g) isto ensure that historic preservation activities are eligible for agencysupport. It is not to be construed as requiring an investment in preservationgreater than what is feasible and prudent for a specific project. Wherepreservation activity is a condition of obtaining a Federal license orpermit, the licensee/permittee may be charged for reasonable preservationcosts. The term ``reasonable'' should take into consideration the preservationpriorities of the agency, the SHPO, and local governments and Indian tribeswhere applicable. This consideration should also include the managementfactors outlined in the guidance for section 110(a)(1). Because it is difficultto establish fair standards that would be applicable in all cases, ``reasonablecosts'' should not be determined using inflexible criteria, such as a flatfee or a standard percentage of a budget, but rather should be determinedon a case-by-case basis, unless otherwise stipulated in law. In determiningwhether preservation efforts are appropriate in given situations and, therefore,whether expenses are reasonable, agencies should refer to the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeologyand Historic Preservation </T3>and develop scopes of work for such activitiesin consultation with the SHPO and other interested persons, and in considerationof the Comprehensive Statewide Historic Preservation Plan, using the proceduresoutlined in 36 CFR Part 800.(b) In procuring preservation service, the following guidelines shouldbe followed, subject to applicable agency contracting and procurement requirements:(1) Whenever possible, preservation services should be combined and procuredin large units, rather than being broken down into many individual procurementactions. Combined procurements enhance efficiency and coordination amongpreservation activities. For example, where an agency anticipates the needfor numerous small identification or documentation projects in a givenState or region, it will normally be most efficient and effective to offera single open-ended contract for such services covering a prescribed periodof time, rather than offering a new contract for each individual project.(2) Normally, services should be procured on the basis of competitive proposalsoffered in response to requests for proposals. A technical evaluation panelcomposed of qualified professionals from within or outside the agency shouldbe used to evaluate and rank proposals based on merit, and negotiationsconcerning the price of the services should be undertaken with the highestranking offerers. Preservation services generally should not be procuredon the basis of price bid only, because the precise services needed canseldom, if ever, be defined clearly and certainly enough to make pricethe only pertinent variable.(3) In some instances, sole-source procurement may be appropriate, forexample where it is certain that only one potential contractor has therequisite qualifications for the work to be done. Where an agency has acontinuing need for a particular set of preservation services in a particularregion, for example, and there is only one qualified organization in theregion, sole-source procurement may be justified. Even in such a circumstance,however, it is recommended that the agency periodically request proposalsfor the conduct of the needed work, to determine whether the sole sourceused in the past continues to be the only qualified offerer.(4) Where the work to be procured involves planning, identification, andevaluation of historic properties, the SHPO should be given the opportunityto participate both in developing the scope of work and on the technicalevaluation panel, and the work should conform to the <T3>Secretary's Standards for Preservation Planning, Identification, andEvaluation.</T3>(5) Where the work to be procured is designed to carry out the intent ofan agreement developed pursuant to 36 CFR Part 800, the consulting partiesinvolved in developing the agreement should be given the opportunity toparticipate in developing the scope of work and in the technical evaluationpanel. Scopes of work should be developed in consultation with the SHPOand should take into account the Comprehensive Statewide Historic PreservationPlan. The National Park Service can also offer assistance in scope of workdevelopment and in proposal evaluation. Agencies should contact the Chief,Interagency Resources Division (see address in the first paragraph of PartIV of these Guidelines) to determine which office of the Service can bestprovide assistance on a case by case basis depending on the expertise necessary.(6) Where an agency procures services for the conduct of archeologicaldata recovery, the scope of work should:(i) Ensure that recovery will be focused on significant, defensible researchtopics; (ii) Ensure that the project will be sufficiently flexible to respond tounexpected discoveries and unanticipated research topics;(iii) Ensure that offerers are encouraged to offer creative proposals abouthow best to meet the research and management needs of the project, andare not unduly limited to technical prescriptions;(iv) Be consistent with the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for ArcheologicalDocumentation, </T3>taking into account other pertinent Advisory Counciland Department of the Interior guidance (recommendations concerning thescope of work may be obtained by contacting the Departmental ConsultingArcheologist, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior,P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013-7127); and, (v) Take into account the Comprehensive Statewide Historic PreservationPlan and other relevant SHPO guidance. (7) Where an agency procures services for the conduct of architecturalor engineering documentation, the scope of work should be consistent withthe <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Architecturaland Engineering Documentation; </T3>the recommendations of the HABS/HAERDivision of the National Park Service on scopes or work may be obtainedby contacting the Chief, Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic AmericanEngineering Record, National Park Service, United States Department ofthe Interior, Washington, DC 20013-7127.(8) Where an agency procures services for the conduct of historical documentation,the scope of work should be consistent with the <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for HistoricalDocumentation. </T3>(9) The cost of caring for, documenting, and otherwise preserving artifacts,records and remains related to historic properties may be regarded as aneligible project cost. 36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register, </T4>52 FR 33740), includes additional informationconcerning funding for curation of archeological artifacts, records, andremains. <T3>Related Requirements and Guidance: </T3>36 CFR Part 79, <T3>Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archeological Collections</T3>(proposed on August 28, 1987; see <T4>Federal Register, </T4>52 FR 32740).

Inquiries concerning how Federalagencies can participate in the awards program should be addressed to theAdvisory Council at the address in the first paragraph of Part IV of theseGuildelines.Section 110(i)<T3>Requirement:</T3> ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to requirethe preparation of an environmental impact statement where such a statementwould not otherwise be required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969, and nothing in this Act shall be construed to provide anyexemption from any requirement respecting the preparation of such a statementunder such Act.''<T3>Applicability:</T3> Section 110(i) applies to all Federal agencies.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Agencies should ensure that their actions under section110 are fully coordinated with their programs of environmental review underthe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as with their programsfor compliance with section 106 of the Act, 36 CFR Part 800, the ArchaeologicalResources Protection Act, and such agency-specific legislation as section4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act, the Federal Land Policy andManagement Act, the National Forest Management Act, and the Housing andCommunity Development Act. To the maximum extent possible, agencies shouldplan their historic preservation activities in such a way that each projectsatisfies all pertinent statutory requirements. Doing this eliminates theneed for redundant data collection efforts.Agencies should ensure that when preparation of an environmental documentis required by NEPA, its preparation is fully coordinated with the agency'simplementation of sections 106 and 110 of the Act and these guidelines.Where appropriate, the agency's historic preservation activities shouldbe described, summarized, or referenced in such documents.The <T3>Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeologyand Historic Preservation</T3> provide guidance to assist agencies in carryingout historic preservation activities in a manner that is consistent withthese various statutory requirements. 36 CFR 800.14 provides directionregarding integration of NEPA and section 106 requirements.<T3>Related Requirements and Guidance:</T3> 36 CFR Part 800, <T3>Protection of Historic Properties.</T3> These regulations, issued bythe Advisory Council, implement the requirement in section 106 of the Actthat Federal agencies consider the effect of their undertakings on hstoricproperties.Section 110(j)<T3>Requirement:</T3> ``The Secretary shall promulgate regulations underwhich the requirements of this section may be waived in whole or in partin the event of a major natural disaster or an imminent threat to the nationalsecurity.''<T3>Applicability:</T3> Section 110(j) applies to the Secretary of theInterior.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The regulations promulgated under this requirement,<T3>Waiver of Federal Agency Responsibilities under Section 110 of theNational Historic Preservation Act,</T3> can be found in the Code of FederalRegulations under 36 CFR Part 78.
