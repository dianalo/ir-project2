The agency, which insures deposits at commercial banks, last weekbegan taking control of more than 200 insolvent Sandamp;Ls under ordersfrom President Bush.   ``Our new fraud squad will be dispatched to the scene wheneverour on-sight teams discover evidence of fraud or insider abuse,''FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said in a speech prepared fordelivery to a group of accountants in Minneapolis.   James Dudine, a section chief in the FDIC's division of banksupervision, will dispatch fraud teams selected from among 80specially trained bank examiners.   In another development, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,Freddie Mac, recommended Thursday the Bush administrationrestructure the Freddie Mac board of directors as part of its planfor the savings and loan crisis.   Freddie Mac was created by Congress in 1970 to provide money forhome mortgages by purchasing the mortgages, packaging them intosecurities and reselling them to investors.   Currently, it is controlled by three directors who also comprisethe Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates savings and loaninstitutions. Bush has proposed that the bank board be shrunk to onemember, who would become an official of the Treasury Department.   The current Freddie Mac board said it should be replaced by a13-member board, chaired by the remaining bank board chairman. Theother 12 board members would include four government officials, twopresidential appointees, three members elected by publicshareholders and three directors elected by the other 10 directors.   Meanwhile, a Chicago-based think tank, the Mid America Institutefor Public Policy Research, said the bank board had given it a$148,000 grant to conduct an ``independent study'' of regulators'year-end spree of 75 savings and loan rescues. Congress' GeneralAccounting Office is also reviewing the deals.</TEXT></DOC>
