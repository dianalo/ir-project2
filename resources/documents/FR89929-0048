The panel reported further that in the vast majority of suchaccidents the failure or inability to follow IFR procedures was presentand that over half of those accidents occurred during night-VFR flight.The full text of this report, entitled ``Final Report of an Informal Panelon General Aviation Safety Submitted to J. Lynn Helms, FAA Administrator,''is in the regulatory docket associated with this rulemaking action andmay be reviewed there by interested parties.The FAA's analysis of pertinent safety data supported the panel's reportand recommendation. In issuing Notice No. 85-14 (50 FR 30124; July 23,1985), the FAA endorsed the panel's recommendation and proposed to amendSection 91.105 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR Part 91)to establish standard visibility and cloud clearance minimums for all night-VFRoperations except for helicopter operations in uncontrolled airspace. Underthat proposal, the reduced minimums applicable to VFR flight in uncontrolledairspace would be eliminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The following aviation organizations supported the proposal without anyreservation:<ITAG tagnum="25">Air Transport Association of America (ATA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">National Business Aircraft Association, Inc. (NBAA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Business and Commercial Aviation, White Plains, NY</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA)</ITAG>Several aviation organizations agreed with the proposal and offered additionalrecommendations. Such recommendations were made by the following commenters:<ITAG tagnum="25">Star Aviation, Spearfish, SD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) (United Kingdom)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Helicopter Association International (HAI)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Hynes Aviation Industries, Inc. (HAII), Frederick, OK</ITAG>Star Aviation, while agreeing with the proposal, suggested that the FAAallow instrument qualified pilots to operate aircraft at night within 50nautical miles of their base of operation provided visibility is at least1 statute mile and the ceiling is 500 feet or higher. The FAA agrees withStar Aviation's implication that an IFR-current pilot should have no difficultyin transitioning from VFR flight to flight under IFR. However, nothingin the proposal would prohibit such an occurrence. For example, regardlessof the established minimum visibility for night-VFR flight, an IFR-currentpilot, when operating in uncontrolled airspace under VFR and when encounteringinstrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in uncontrolled airspace, wouldsimply change his/her cruising altitude from that required for VFR flightto that required for IFR flight. The reverse of this situation would betrue also; i.e., if that same pilot would again encounter visual meteorologicalconditions (VMC) while in uncontrolled airspace, he/she would simply changefrom an IFR-cruising altitude to a VFR-cruising altitude. In neither ofthese situations would the pilot be required to obtain an air traffic control(ATC) clearance. Only when the pilot entered controlled airspace and encounteredIMC would the pilot be required to obtain an ATC clearance. This wouldbe true regardless of the adoption of the minimum visibility and cloudclearance distances proposed in Notice 85-14.The HAI, while in general agreement with the proposal, made an editorialsuggestion. HAI recommended that the statement ``except as provided inparagraph (b) and in andSection; 91.107'' be retained in the revised tablein paragraph (a). The FAA agrees that a similar phrase is currently inthat table and could continue to be used for other purposes, such as whenthat table is taken out of context and used as a stand-alone illustration.However, since andSection; 91.107 applies only to special VFR (SVFR) operationsand such operations are permitted only in certain control zones, the inclusionof a reference to andSection; 91.107 in the table in andSection; 91.105(a)would be inappropriate. Therefore, the FAA has partially adopted the HAIrecommendation and has revised the table in andSection; 91.105(a) to notethe exceptions in andSection; 91.105(b).Both the HAI and HAII conditioned their concurrence with the proposal onthe assumption that the proposed rule would not change any provision currentlyavailable to helicopters. Further examination of the proposal, in regardto proposed andSection; 91.105(b), revealed that the provision whereby helicoptersare permitted to operate clear of clouds in uncontrolled airspace was inadvertentlyomitted. Adoption of this proposal without this provision would have causedhelicopters to be required to maintain the same distance from clouds asfixed-wing aircraft when conducting operations below 1,200 feet in uncontrolledairspace. It was not the intention of the FAA to propose any change toandSection; 91.105 pertaining to helicopters; therefore, the FAA has modifiedthe proposal to retain the provision whereby helicopter operations arepermitted to operate clear of clouds instead of the distance specifiedin the notice.The CAA, in agreeing with the proposal, suggested that a maximum speedbe specified for helicopters operating in uncontrolled airspace with lessthan 1 mile visibility. CAA also suggested that a new type of rating beadopted and issued to pilots who have demonstrated an ability to operatein reduced visibilities and distances from clouds. The FAA notes that thesuggestion concerning a maximum helicopter speed is beyond the scope ofthe notice. In regard to the suggested new type of rating, the FAA believesthat such a rating already exists_an instrument rating, which permits anIFR-current pilot to operate in meteorological conditions less than currentlyrequired for operations conducted under VFR.While expressing general agreement with the proposal, AOPA suggested thatoperations conducted under VFR in uncontrolled airspace within a closedairport traffic pattern should be permitted to continue to operate underthe provisions of the current rule. This, AOPA stated, would allow pilotsto maintain currency and proficiency in night takeoffs and landings perandSection; 61.57(d). Further, it is AOPA's opinion that a pilot operatingin a closed pattern, within one-half mile of the runway, at traffic patternairspeeds, is able to maintain contact with the landing environment andavoid any objects by an adequate safety margin. Another commenter sharedthis opinion, but added that many of these operations are conducted byIFR-current pilots in IFR-equipped aircraft.The FAA agrees with AOPA that safety can be maintained in a closed trafficpattern of an airport in uncontrolled airspace when the pilot can maintainvisual contact with the landing environment. Operations in an airport trafficpattern within one-half mile of the runway should enable the pilot to maintainsuch visual contact and be in a position to land immediately should themeteorological conditions deteriorate. Accordingly, the FAA has modifiedthe proposed rule to permit operations in a closed traffic pattern withinone-half mile of the runway provided such operations are conducted withat least 1 mile visibility and the aircraft remains clear of clouds.One commenter, objecting to the proposal, suggested that changing the regulationwould not solve the problem but that better education of pilots would.Objecting to the proposal, another commenter suggested that the FAA considerincreasing the instrument proficiency requirement for a private pilot certificate.This commenter also stated that additional recurrent training should berequired for private pilots. However, neither of these commenters providedany suggestion as to the kind or extent of training that should be required.In any regard, the FAA believes that the current rules associated withnight-VFR flight currency and general pilot proficiency are adequate andpromote safety. Further, the FAA is of the belief that the rule as adoptedwill require that pilots be more cognizant of the actual meteorologicalconditions when planning night-VFR operations.One of the commenters, in objecting to the proposal, stated that therewould be a negative impact on many operators arriving or departing airportsin uncontrolled airspace because many of these airports do not have adequateradio or telephone communications for obtaining an IFR clearance or cancellingan IFR flight plan. An IFR operation in uncontrolled airspace does notrequire a flight plan, nor does it require an IFR clearance. Therefore,radio or telephone communications required for IFR flight in controlledairspace is unnecessary for an airport in uncontrolled airspace.There were several other commenters that objected to the proposal on thegrounds that the rule would impact their operation in some way.The FAA has considered all of the comments received and, except for thesuggestions adopted that modify the proposal, believes that the potentialsafety benefits of the proposal far outweigh any potential impacts whichmay result from the implementation of this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Determination</ITAG>The amendment set forth herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the National Government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalismimplications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>Analysis of Benefits and CostsThe primary benefit of the final rule is potentially fewer accidents, witha consequential reduction in loss of life and diminished property damage.Precise quantification of the benefit is not feasible because the rule'seffectiveness can be estimated only roughly. As noted in the General AviationSafety Panel report, the number of general aviation accidents related toweather conditions is extremely high, and improved effectiveness shouldbe a major benefit.The panel found that 40 percent of fatal general aviation accidents involvedweather as a cause or factor, with low ceilings being a leading causalfactor in fatal accidents. For the period 1976 to 1980, 60 percent of fatalaccidents in which the pilot had continued VFR flight in adverse weatherconditions occurred when the ceiling was 1,000 feet or less, and only 16percent occurred when the ceiling was above 2,000 feet. In 1980, for example,over 50 percent of such accidents occurred during darkness, even though,according to the panel, only about 5 to 10 percent of VFR flying by generalaviation pilots occurs at night. In 1977, 258 fatal accidents involvingweather as a cause or factor occurred. The year 1977 is elected as a typicalyear for general aviation activity within the panel's study period of 1976-1980.After adjusting for hour of day, type of operation and visibility or ceilingfactors, 19 accidents involving 36 fatalities comprised the basis for estimatingthe rule's potential benefits.Effectiveness of the regulation is difficult to estimate since there maynot be 100 percent compliance with the current rule. If there is 100 percenteffectiveness of the rule adopted, however, and the 1977 history is takenas a reasonable approximation of an average year, then the benefit of therule would be approximately $36 million annually, if only 36 lives couldbe saved.The cost of implementing this final rule is the value of time that travelersmight lose because of deferred, cancelled, or rescheduled trips. Calculatingthis cost requires specific data, including frequency of trips, personsaboard (since not only aircraft hours, but also person hours are relevant),time lost due to the final rule's weather standards, and the purposes oftrips (since the purpose of a trip determines its value).The final rule affects only VFR operations in uncontrolled airspace withinthe criteria for visibility and cloud cover. Many operations, such as thosein controlled airspace, are not affected; nor are operations within thecriterion condition for cloud cover when visibility is 3 miles or more.Although the FAA has no accurate count of operations the rule actuallywill affect, the panel stated that only 5 to 10 percent of general aviationVFR flights occur at night. The FAA's data indicates approximately 3.5million conditions in 1983. This number equals approximately 10 percentof total general aviation flying hours and is the basis for assuming thenumber of trips affected.The 3.5 million night VFR hours are assumed to account for 1.75 milliontrips, and the final rule to affect 10 percent of these trips.The estimate of cost assumes a delay of 2 hours per trip for each of 2.5persons per trip, the average occupancy of the major type of piston aircraftlikely to be affected. The FAA values the time of air travelers at $24per hour.The estimated cost to implement the final rule equals the product of 175,000trips (X) 2.5 persons per trip (X) 2 hours delay per trip (X) $24 per hour,which is $21 million per year. The estimated potential benefits exceedthe estimated costs of implementing the final rule. While precise numericalestimates of benefits and costs attributable to the final rule are notachievable, the FAA concludes that the estimates are reliable.Regulatory Flexibility DeterminationThe small entities potentially affected by this rule are those businesseswhich operate VFR only, at night, in uncontrolled airspace. The final regulatoryevaluation in the docket discusses in detail the extent of the potentialeconomic impact on these entities. The Federal Aviation Administrationhas certified that the final rule will not have significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.Trade Impact StatementThe Federal Aviation Administration has determined that this regulationwill not have an impact on international trade because it affects onlydomestic operating rules for flights.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons stated above, the FAA has determined that this is not amajor regulation as defined in Executive Order 12291. The FAA has furtherdetermined that this action is not significant as defined in Departmentof Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979). In addition, for reasons discussed in the Regulatory EvaluationSummary, it is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. A full regulatory evaluation has been placedin the public docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in Part 91</ITAG>Aviation safety, Air traffic control, Flight visibility, Visual flightrules, Traffic pattern.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 91_GENERAL OPERATING AND FLIGHT RULES</ITAG>For the reasons set forth above, part 91, subpart B, of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR part 91) is amended as follows:1.
