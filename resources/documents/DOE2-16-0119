The implementation of a humanfactors code list, developed during the project, could provide the meanswhereby such information could be obtained and could provide the basisfor identifying priorities for accident programs concentrating on humanfactors. The current accident-reporting system was developed to fulfillstatutory obligations rather than to provide an avenue for identifyingunderlying causative factors. Nevertheless, only relatively minor changeswould be required to provide the valuable information. The project hastherefore shown that an accident-reporting system, sensitive to human-factorsissues in accident etiology is feasible and has provided the basis onwhich such a system could be developed for assessment.</TEXT></DOC>
