(table)Some front ends and development environments. (table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>When PC database servers were first introduced, they were proclaimed as apanacea.andP;  Drop a database server onto the network, the proclamations went,and all your problems will disappear.andP;  Only the database server machine mustbe powerful; users can have any old clunky machine and still get greatresponse as long as the server has enough power.andP;  And with most of thesoftware residing on the database server, RAM cram disappears.andP;  Users will nolonger wait ten minutes for a simple query.andP;  They won't have to go to lunchwhile waiting for a report to be generated.andP;  So drop in the database server,fire up the front end, and off you go.andP;  So they said.andM;it hasn't turned out that way.andP;  Manufacturers clearly underestimated thetask.andP;  While the database engine itself came to the market fairly fast, thearrival of useful front ends has been excruciatingly slow.andP;  And MIS doesn'tmake decisions overnight.andM;Mostly MISandM;The client-server architecture and the database server haven't been embracedinstantly by MIS and the LAN departments.andP;  But interest is on the upswing asfront ends and development tools are beginning to trickle in.andP;  Companies aremoving from the evaluation stage into the production stage.andM;Two major camps of users are installing database servers.andP;  MIS is beginningto downsize applications from the minicomputer or mainframe.andP;  The LAN peopleare accessing data via altered PC applications.andP;  The vast majority of thedatabase servers are being installed by the MIS department.andP;  Kevin Canady,managing editor of SQL Server Environment, a journal for users of Microsoft'sSQL Server, estimates that 60 to 70 percent of the database servers installedtoday are used to downsize applications.andP;  in a well-publicized example, Kodakis moving an application from IBM System/3Xs to Microsoft's SQL Server.andP;  AndK-mart is replacing its IBM Series/1 minicomputers with five of Gupta'sSQLBase database servers.andM;MIS finds the economics and politics of the database server attractive.andP;  &quot;Ifthe people have been using minis traditionally, there's an incentive to movesome of the processing to DOS.andP;  It's cheap, it's there, it's logical, andit's easy,&quot; says Sherri Osaka, product marketing manager for connectivity atdatabase vendor Informix.andP;  &quot;It tends to give MIS some control back,&quot; sheadds.andM;Pcs are becoming cheaper and more powerful.andP;  A 10 MIPS machine at $10,000 isan irresistible force, especially when compared to a $6 million mainframe.andO;Brian Linn, Director of Product Marketing at Gupta Technologies, concurs: MIS is beginning to take advantage of the clear-cut economics to use PCs andthe client server architecture.andP;  It is a slow but steady progression.&quot;andM;Using database servers, however, requires MIS to realign its attitudes andapproaches.andP;  But by doing so, it can regain control of the many PCS &quot;outthere,&quot; which should be an important incentive.andP;  By putting the PCs on anetwork, MIS can find out exactly what applications people are running.andP;  TheLAN becomes part of MIS's domain where they know that the data is secure andbacked up.andM;And although the PC LAN group only installs 20 to 30 percent of the databaseservers, LAN users are attracted to database servers because they enableaccess to new information.andP;  For the first time, PC applications such as Exceland Lotus can access sales information that once could only be generated byMIS reports.andP;  And new applications will allow wider access to information.andO;Mid-sized businesses will migrate to database servers as their traditionalmicro databases run out of steam.andM;A Manhattan trust bank, US Trust, switched to a database server because itsbiggest database problem was poor performance.andP;  US Trust was using anapplication written in Nantucket's Clipper to give 150 employees access tothe 1 million documents in its optical retrieval system.andP;  With Banyan Vines,NETBIOS, a mainframe gateway, and electronic mail, extra RAM for a databasefront end was scarce.andM;US Trust moved to a distributed database, VIA/DRE, to reduce the amount oftraffic on the wire and the memory consumption on the work station.andP;  &quot;It'samazing how much faster [VIA] is,&quot; comments Fred Levine, vice president ofLAN services at US Trust.andM;While the LAN group and the MIS group have many of the same concerns, theyhave fundamentally different priorities.andM;Primarily, the MIS group wants power in database server, and the LAN groupwants ease of use.andP;  The high end of the market is interested in databaseservers that run UNIX and perhaps OS/2.andP;  They want online transactionprocessing, high performance, and tight security.andP;  They are less interestedin ease of use than the low end of market.andP;  For those with PC LANS,administering the database is not their full-time job.andP;  They want a databaseserver that is fast, secure, and reliable, but they stress the importance ofease of use and maintenance.andM;Not Just PCsandM;Some have predicted that database servers will make minicomputers extinct.andO;Once databases are running on powerful multiprocessor servers such as theNetframe or the Compaq Systempro, the need for the minicomputer will fade.andO;The extremists even predict the death of the mainframe.andP;  And while one canpoint to specific instances to prove the point, in general, database servershave not sounded the death knell for the mini.andP;  Yes, some companies willreplace their minis with PC database servers.andP;  Some will use PC serversexclusively or in addition to a mainframe.andP;  Others will tie their PC usersright to the mainframe database.andM;Merrill Lynch is one corporate user that won't be using a PC database server,yet.andP;  For Merrill Lynch, IBM'S DB2 relational database will be the dataserver, at least for now.andP;  Today, investment bankers at Merrill Lynch mustjuggle 3270 terminal screens to help customers.andP;  But with the applicationunder development, the financial whizzes will have to look at only one screento see the information they once had to switch through as many as eightscreens to get.andP;  The investment banking group is developing an applicationpermitting bankers to overlay very important information-clients' names,bankers' lists, histories, and other necessary data-on a single Windowsscreen.andP;  &quot;They don't have to lose their train of thought,&quot; says DannyMoeller, an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch.andM;The underlying link is a SQLNetwork, a database gateway from Gupta.andP;  And todevelop the application, Merrill Lynch is using SQLWINdows, Gupta's front-enddevelopment tool.andM;Access directly to DB2 and other relational databases is the key reason forSQL'S importance.andP;  SQL is well entrenched in the mini and mainframe databaseworld, so using SQL on a PC database server is logical.andP;  By using the PCinstead of the 3270 terminal, the user gets all the traditional benefits ofthe PC, including an easy-to-use interface and the ability to process datalocally.andM;&quot;The users for whom we haven't yet written an application are asking to bechanged to a Windows environment,&quot; says Moeller.andM;Typical IBM customers are not using DB2 for transaction processing; they areusing it for decision support functions such as sales forecasting.andP;  So thelink between PC databases, typically used for decision support, and DB2 is anatural.andP;  &quot;This is exactly what you might think an Excel user wants.andP;  Nowthat DB2 customers are moving to production system, it's opening a whole newworld,&quot; says Linn.andM;The Grey CloudandM;The technical merits of the database server are clear.andP;  The user sees onlythe front-end application, which is the portion responsible for presentingthe data and handling the user's requests.andP;  Requests, most often in the formof SQL commands, are shuttled across the network to the database server,which most often is separate from the file server.andP;  A database server isdedicated to its task.andP;  It performs the queries and searches requested by theuser, and returns the resulting answer.andM;Network traffic is significantly reduced because the user's work stationsends only requests to the database server, and the database server processesthe request locally, returning only the answer.andP;  Traditional databasessatisfy a user's requirements at the user work station.andP;  So, when a userqueries a 5,000-record table, all 5,000 records are downloaded from the fileserver to the user's PC.andM;The database server is also an economic solution.andP;  The database servermachine must be fast and have lots of cache memory available.andP;  All databaseusers don't need powerful work stations.andM;Once the software is broken into front and back ends, the front end can beany number of things, including a spreadsheet,  a  query-by-example form, oran accounting package.andM;While the advantages are clear, it's equally apparent that companies have notrushed out to install database servers, either.andP;  It is rare that one canpoint to a sole cause for a situation.andP;  Database servers are no exception.andO;Their stagnation can be attributed to numerous factors, including thecomplexity of the application, the lack of front ends and development tools,the lack of standards, and perhaps even the lack of widespread need.andM;Database servers are not useful for tables of 500 records.andP;  Database serversare used for mission-critical applications; they are used at the very heartof a company's business.andP;  NASA is building a pilot program around a databaseserver to track spare parts for the space shuttle.andP;  Citibank is developing anapplication for risk management within the financial industry.andP;  AetnaInsurance is planning to build a system to bill a billion dollars per year.andO;Database servers are new solutions to the same problems.andM;&quot;These will be operational, company-wide problems&quot; says Linn.andP;  &quot;It will be anew set of solutions, strategic solutions,  departmental  solutions,mission-critical solutions.&quot; That's a big order to fill.andP;  Building such asystem takes time.andM;Two years ago, while the press and corporate users were being told of thewonders of database servers, vendors promised that front ends would beavailable in no time flat.andP;  It would take little effort to alter existingapplications so they could take advantage of the client-server applications,they said.andP;  But it isn't that easy.andM;&quot;Just because you have an installed base of PC computers, to drop in newproducts should be a lot easier than it is,&quot; says Canady.andM;First and foremost, a front-end application must give a user increasedfunctionality and performance without sacrificing ease of use.andP;  And while anapplication may run against a database engine, users should not know they areusing anything more than the familiar spreadsheet or query-by-example tool.andM;Vendors must resolve this familiar-but more-sophisticated paradox.andP;  Butaltering existing applications to take advantage of the distributed resourceson a network is not so simple.andP;  Most of the micro databases were originallystandalone applications to which record and file locking was added.andP;  They arenow being asked to make a major alteration: to split that application intotwo distinct parts.andP;  While some will hardwire their databases, others willredesign from the ground up.andM;Even if they are committed to restructuring their database, the traditionalmicro database companies must be concerned with their installed base.andP;  Theymust continue to support their customers while moving to a new architecture.andM;A second impediment is the development tools.andP;  If your company's applicationis written in dbase rather than a third-generation language such as C orCobol, it is much more difficult to change that program to run against adatabase server.andP;  Ashton-tate is scheduled to ship the Server Edition ofdBase IV1.1 during the second quarter of 1990.andP;  This version of dbase willinterface SQL Server and provide an upgrade path for those th  sands of dbaseapplications.andP;  And huge numbers of applications written in dbase, this is asignificant problem.andM;Database engine vendors offer development tools for their particulardatabase.andP;  For example, VIA offers VIA/COOL and VIA/paint, an object orientedlanguage and a screen painter.andP;  Gupta offers SQLWindows for its SQLBase.andO;Novell offers XQL for its Netware SQL.andM;Most users want a graphical interface, yet most programmers are unfamiliarwith object-oriented programming or working with Microsoft Windows.andP;  &quot;A lotof companies are struggling with OS/2 Presentation Manager and Windows,&quot; saysTim Harmon, president of Strategic Technologies Group, a developer of frontends.andP;  &quot;It's an entirely new technology.andP;  A lot of programmers have a hardtime working with it.andP;  It's a completely different type of programming.&quot;andM;Both the end users and third-party developers are faced with some seriouschoices.andP;  There are so many operating systems, network operating systems, andgraphical interfaces around that programmers are being spread thin.andM;Once the developmental and environmental issues are settled, there are issuesof SQL compatibility.andP;  There is ANSI SQL and IBM SQL.andP;  Then a number of thedatabase vendors have made extensions to SQL.andP;  For example, Microsoft andSybase have TransactSQL, which is more efficient within that environment butincompatible with any other vendor's engine.andM;Linn says, &quot;Interoperability is still an obstacle.andP;  Standards are fine, butyou have to pick the right standard.andP;  The standard is set by the mainframe,by DB2.andP;  The mistake some have made [in developing) is solutions that don'thave anything to do with existing SQL on the mainframe, which should be thebenefit of SQL.andP;  MIS won't look seriously at database servers if they can'tdo SQL.&quot;andM;Perhaps some of the slow acceptance can be attributed to the lack ofwidespread need.andP;  Database servers are not &quot;going to be a new day dawning.andO;It's not happening now and it's not ever going to happen,&quot; says Doug Gold,director of communications research at international Data Corp., a marketresearch firm.andP;  Although most manufacturers try to sell their products to theFortune 500 or even the Fortune 1000, 80 percent of LANS have five or sixnodes, according to IDC'S figures.andM;&quot;You have to look at the perspective of what LANS are being used for, thepromise and the reality.andP;  LANS are used for sharing printers.andP;  There was alot of hype about what SQL will do, and how people will find real use fortheir LANS.andP;  But 95 percent of the people will never use a database,&quot; saysGold.andM;The Pot of GoldandM;People don't have to know NetBIOS or IPX calls to use a network.andP;  Similarly,people shouldn't have to know SQL to use a database server.andP;  SQL'S mainbenefit is its link to the mainframe and minicomputer relational database.andO;SQL is not an end-user tool.andP;  It's not query-by-example, it's not aspreadsheet.andM;Today, most front ends thinly disguise SQL.andP;  While you may not have to typethem in, you point and click on SQL statements.andP;  As the sophistication ofthese fledgling front ends grows, the SQL will be better hidden.andM;To disguise the complexities of the engine, most front-end applications use agraphical user interface.andP;  Graphical interfaces and object-orientedprogramming make some very complex interactions seem simple.andP;  And corporateusers have made it clear they want a graphical interface.andP;  This interface canbe the Macintosh, Windows, X Windows, or Presentation Manager.andM;Today, many of the PC database front ends are based on Microsoft Windows.andO;And the debut of Windows 3.0 should spur on the introduction of more databasefront ends.andM;Canady predicts that Apple will play a major role in front-end development.andO;&quot;A low-end Mac would make a perfect data entry product to access aclient-server database.andP;  Apple is in a good position.andP;  They have had fiveyears to fine-tune their interface.&quot;andM;There isn't the same lack of front ends in the Mac database server world asthere is for DOS and OS/2.andP;  There isn't the multiplicity of choices, either,so developers can concentrate their efforts.andP;  Oracle for Mac, for example,has a number of front ends.andP;  There are quite a few products that connect Macfront ends to relational databases running on the VAX.andM;Developing front-end applications is a big task, but it's being done.andP;  Therewas a noticeable influx of front ends beginning in January.andP;  According toCanady, &quot;We're starting to look around the wall, and by summer it will be aflurry.andP;  What we have seen is not slideware.&quot;andM;Borland has begun shipping Paradox SQL Link, which allows Paradox users toaccess data stored in SQL Server, OS/2 Database Manager, Oracle Server, andNetware SQL.andP;  Revelation Technologies is shipping Advanced Revelation for SQLServer and for Netware SQL.andP;  DataEase also has altered its database to runagainst SQL Server.andP;  Zanthe's Zim database works with Gupta's SQLBase.andM;Excel operates with SQL Server, and soon, VIA/DRE.andP;  Lotus 1-2-3 will workwith SQLBase and Sybase.andP;  Henley Business Software has SQLVision for Lotus1-2-3; this allows users to embed SQL statements into macros to access datain Gupta's Sqlbase and IBM'S DB2.andM;While many products have been altered to run as a front end, some are beingdesigned from the ground up.andP;  Vinzant's SQL File allows users to edit datastored in SQL Server or Netware SQL.andP;  SQL Commander/w from StrategicTechnologies Group (Richmond, Va.) is a Windows application that runs as afront end to SQLBase, SQL Server, and soon OS/2 EE.andP;  It combines interactiveSQL with the point-and click interface.andP;  It adds full query management.andP;  Itallows users to be ignorant of SQL; they can save their queries in thedatabase.andM;Forest andamp; Trees from Channel Computing (Rochester, N.H.) is an executiveinformation manager.andP;  But unlike the others, Forest andamp; Trees uses SQL to talkto SQLBase, SQL Server, Oracle, and Sybase.andP;  it can also talk to a number ofmicro databases and spreadsheets, including dbase, R:base, DataEase, Lotus,and Excel.andM;Users build an electronic &quot;dashboard&quot; to monitor the vital signs of theirbusiness.andP;  Although SQL is a key part of Forest andamp; Trees, the user does notneed to be a programmer.andP;  Nor does a consultant have to be called in.andO;Channel Computing has designed its product to be used by &quot;the mildlymotivated&quot; or the person who can write macros but not much else.andP;  Usersdefine their business' vital signs by choosing from Forest andamp; Trees pull downmenus and SQL statements.andM;The DOS version, shipping now, is character-based, although it does mimic agraphical user interface.andP;  The Windows and NewWave versions will offer fullgraphical interfaces and allow more power and flexibility.andP;  These twoversions should ship by summer.andP;  integrating the EngineandM;Perhaps the most important database server important application is as aplatform for other LAN vendors' products.andP;  Many applications can be greatlyenhanced by a database.andP;  Products could be brought to market earlier ifvendors had a readily available database server that could serve as the coreof their product.andP;  The application vendor can concentrate on its strengths,which is writing the application, not a relational database.andP;  With suchproducts, users are unaware of the database.andP;  The vendor may make a passingreference to a database or even SQL.andP;  Some avoid the term database andinstead use workbase or docubase.andM;Many of the bridge and router management packages use SQL databases to storenetwork traffic history.andP;  Using a database makes it simpler for the networktechnician to analyze.andP;  in the past, if these network management systemsprovided any capability, it was usually little more than the ability toexport data to 1-2-3 or dbase.andM;Lanfolio from NMI (Fairfax, Va.) is a new document management system able tooperate over a WAN with an unlimited number of users because it uses adatabase engine.andP;  Its architecture has three levels.andP;  One portion runs onusers' work stations, a second runs as a request server.andP;  The third part is aSQL database server that is the central repository and directory ofdocuments.andM;Saros (Redmond, Wash.) has just revised its Fileshare document managementsystem.andP;  Fileshare is built around SQL Server.andP;  Unlike other documentservers, Fileshare communicates both client-server and server-server.andP;  Sarosjust published  an applications programming interface, so applicationdevelopers can alter their products to be managed by Fileshare.andM;Syzygy from Information Research (Charlottesville, Va.) is project managementsoftware designed for the executive rather than the project manager.andP;  At itsheart is an Oracle database.andM;Coordination Technology (Trumbull, Conn.) is working on an innovative product(called Together) that has SQL Server at its core.andP;  Together is a member,perhaps the only rightful one, of that much-abused category of groupware.andO;Together automates the manager's interactions with other people.andP;  Youorganize your desktop into projects, and it helps you coordinate theactivities of those project members.andP;  The product will support popular OS/2and Presentation Manager applications (when there are some), so you cancontinue to have your favorite applications.andM;Many accounting packages can benefit from a database engine.andP;  AdvancedBusiness Systems Platinum runs against Netware SQL.andP;  Source-mate can use anOracle database.andP;  Oracle's Oracle Financials is a suite of financialapplications including general ledger, payables, purchasing, and assets builtaround the company's SQL database.andM;Document image processing is beginning to shed its proprietary shell and movetowards standards.andP;  With 386 technology and database engines, documentimaging systems based on standards are able to deliver the performance andreliability of the proprietary ones.andM;Viewstar  (Emeryville, Calif.) has built its document imaging system around adatabase engine.andP;  The back end runs DOS or OS/2; the clients run MicrosoftWindows or Viewstar's own windowing interface.andP;  But the user sees only thepaper process he is familiar with, from the paper clip to the yellowPost-it-style note  to  yellow highlighting.andM;Human resource software, once entrenched in the mainframe, is being broughtdown to the PC LAN with database servers.andP;  PeopleSoft (Walnut Creek, Calif.)andO;uses Gupta's SQLbase in its Peoplesoft HRMS software.andP;  Peoplesoft HRMSintegrates the various human resource functions, including personneladministration, recruiting, benefits, and payroll.andP;  IBM SAA compatibility iscritical since the users are comfortable with that look and feel.andM;Database servers have made inroads in the shrink-wrapped software market.andO;Whether the product is a platform LAN product, such as network management, ora vertical market application, such as personnel, the database server isquickly becoming an integral part.andM;ConclusionandM;A database server isn't a shrink-wrapped product.andP;  It isn't WordPerfect.andP;  Adatabase server introduces many issues that are only beginning to beresolved.andP;  MIS and the LAN group must cooperate.andP;  The database engine vendorsand the front-end application vendors must cooperate.andP;  Even the actual serverhardware manufacturers must be brought into the equation.andM;Developing applications for the database server is no mean feat.andO;Programmers, already being spread thin by the abundance of developmentenvironments, are relatively unfamiliar with graphical user interfaces, SQL,and the client-server model of LANS.andP;  The eternal quest for applications thatare more powerful but easier to use will be fulfilled, but it will take timeto resolve these issues.andM;The database server provides very clear advantages when it comes toperformance and flexibility.andP;  But database servers aren't for everyone.andP;  Theywill be very useful to software developers who need to incorporate databasefunctionality into their products.andP;  Database servers won't be useful to thecompany with a 50-client sales database.andM;But they are useful for keeping a $3 million spare parts inventory.andP;  Andthat's something that just could not be done on PC LANS until the advent ofthe database engine.andM;If you are not just throwing technology at a problem, instead of usingtechnology to solve a business problem, then the database server may be anequally key component for you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
