There's been such a &quot;geewhiz&quot; quality to it all.andM;It's been fun, reminiscent of the technoeuphoria most of us felt the firstime we saw laser printing or a Mac running in color.andP;  In the case of System7.0, however, there's a big difference.andP;  Apple didn't deliver any newproducts, only projections.andP;  And in the past, Apple's projections aboutsoftware have been like money in the bank -- a Texas Sandamp;L, that is.andM;Let's wipe the stardust from our eyes, brush the confetti out of our hair andget some perspective.andP;  First of all, Apple made it quite clear that it wasn'tissuing a product announcement for System 7.0 yet, only a &quot;directionalstatement.&quot;andP;  Translated from Teflonese (the official language of PR types),Apple didn't utter the equivalent of &quot;the rabbit died,&quot; but merely.andP;  &quot;I don'thave a headache tonight.&quot;andM;Will Apple really deliver all the features described at the conference in thenext major system software upgrade?andP;  Will they all work?andP;  We can only surmisebased on Apple's previous performance, and the past is not without its darkermoments.andM;Take the case of Macintosh BASIC, Apple's not-so-secret project a few yearsago to create the definitive Mac programming language.andP;  Regardless of whetherApple officially announced Mac BASIC, Apple's directional statements about itwere direct enough that at least six publishers brought out books on thesubject.andP;  And thousands of Mac users, myself included, bought those books.andM;When Mac BASIC was nearing completion, amidst critical acclaim from thosewho'd worked with beta versions, Apple abandoned the project with littleexplanation.andP;  Allegedly, the company succumbed to strong pressures fromwithin the industry by developers who saw Mac BASIC as too great acompetitive threat.andM;So much for directional statements; the only direction Mac BASIC ever toolswas clockwise when it was north of the equator and counterclockwise when itwas south.andM;With System 7.0, will Apple deliver fully functional, high-quality softwareacross the board and within a reasonable time frame? Perhaps, but in the pastApple has produced software that bent its own rules beyond recognition.andP;  Andit's proved itself capable of shipping software with more than a few bugs,glitches, gaffes and other little blemishes (although, with the recent System6.0 release, that's tantamount to saying the Titanic sprang a little leak).andM;Apple actually said very little about its timetable for System 7.0, otherthan that it will seed developers with early versions in the fall.andP;  Acommonly heard extrapolation is that we'll all have the new software in ourhands about three to six months later.andM;Get a life!andP;  These projections are based on information from people who'dhave you believe time began on Jan. 1, 1904.andP;  Apple's definition of &quot;fall isany month that doesn't have a &quot;w&quot; in it.andP;  It's probably safe to say System7.0 will arrive somtime in 1990 -- about as safe as predicting that Applewill ship a laptop in 1989.andM;In the meantime, my Mac BASIC book still sits here, right next to &quot;The LotusGuide to Jazz in Business&quot; -- a reminder of how precarious it can be to hitchour wagons to directional statements.andP;  The point is not to vilify Apple inperpetuity for its past practices.andP;  It certainly doesn't have a monopoly onblemishes.andP;  That's the complexion of the whole industry, and Apple's recordis actually cleaner than most.andM;What's important is remembering that System 7.0 remains just so muchconjecture, and that anyone who bases long-term plans on Apple's catalog offeatures for System 7.0 may be in for some unsettling surprises.andP;  DespiteApple's good intentions, we'll surely suffer disappointments, delays anddeviations from the plan.andP;  It comes with the territory.andM;Apple has set its sights high for System 7.0 and projected an exciting futurefor us all.andP;  It really can't be faulted for the present uncertainties.andP;  Mostimportant, the Cupertino oligarchs are finally talking and listening to us.andO;And, in the end, that was the biggest news of all last May.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
