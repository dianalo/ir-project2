Negotiations continued on proposed reductions andtransfers within Pentagon accounts to accommodate the newexpenditures, but the appropriations leadership appearedconfident that a package will be enacted before the MemorialDay recess beginning next week.</LP><TEXT>   Amendments on abortion rights and the death penalty werestripped from the measure last night, and House Democratsagreed to insert waivers intended to expedite the CentralAmerican aid if lawmakers can't agree on related authorizinglegislation.   The action represents a concession to President Bush, butthe victory carries a high price tag. The domestic portion ofthe bill has grown steadily under the pressure of lawmakers,and influential members seized the opportunity to initiatehome-state projects and allow the transfer of funds to payfor House members' election-year mail.   Environmentalists blunted an effort by Southernagriculture interests to weaken federal wetlands protections.But in a little-noticed fight over the future of the privateU.S. space industry, the conference approved language seekingto block the participation of a United Technologies Corp.subsidiary in an Australian launch facility.   The Central American aid -- $420 million for Panama and$300 million for Nicaragua -- represents the bulk of Mr.Bush's initial request this spring. But the administrationstill faces a difficult floor fight next week on the relatedquestion of imposing conditions on U.S. military assistanceto El Salvador.   Democrats have picked up significant support for theirdemand that 50% of the assistance be withheld through fiscal1991, and Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.,), chairman of theDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, joined in backing anamendment to give the civilian Cristiani government greatercontrol of the funds.   Mr. Murtha's leadership is significant because of his tiesto fellow moderates and Southern conservatives, and a strongvote would add to the pressure on the State Department towithhold a substantial portion of any new Salvadoran militaryaid in fiscal 1991. &quot;They have to go to 50% in `91,&quot; said Mr.Murtha. &quot;We're funding the military, and the military has toreform.&quot;   The Central America debate brought two former Housespeakers, James Wright and Thomas O'Neill, back into the frayin an unusual display of letters to their former colleagues.Mr. Wright, who resigned a year ago, has appealed to membersto first expedite passage of the aid to Nicaragua and Panama,while Mr. O'Neill's letter directly addresses the El Salvadorquestion and supports the conditions on future aid.   Apart from the Central American assistance, the billincludes a total of $55 million distributed among accountsfor the Caribbean, Chile and Africa. An estimated $75 millionin supplemental funds are provided for U.S. refugee programs,and in a related provision, Israel would get $400 million inloan guarantees for housing of incoming Soviet Jews. Underpressure from the House, fees to the U.S. for the guaranteeswere increased to $2.8 million up front, but a $125,000ceiling is set on annual fees charged to the Jerusalemgovernment.   Defense negotiators last night appeared determined toblock construction of a costly Louisiana explosives plantpreviously protected by the Senate, but among domesticaccounts, the pattern was one of accommodation.   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrdemerged with a $185 million down payment on a new FederalBureau of Investigation fingerprint facility for his homestate of West Virginia, and the laundry list of smalleradditions ran from a Great Lakes research vessel to a earthendam in northern California.   House lawmakers, who are spending far beyond theirappropriated allotment for mail this year, won broadauthority to transfer as much as $25 million in unobligatedfunds from other accounts to meet the projected deficit.   And while adding an estimated $177 million to firefightingaccounts in the Bureau of Land Management, the conferencealso provided that $77 million be used to replenish otherInterior Department accounts that were tapped in meeting thecosts of fires last year.   Among business interests, the bill would force theadministration to proceed with the so-calledinterest-equalization program of the Export-Import Bank,effectively providing $20 million for what would be a $200million loan program to encourage exports.   By contrast, the provision related to United Technologiesgrows out of an effort by Senate Commerce Committee ChairmanErnest Hollings to curb export licenses for Americantechnology or satellites in private efforts using Soviet orChinese-built launchers.   Though allowing for a presidential waiver in casesinvolving national security, the South Carolina Democratfirst attached satellite restrictions last fall to anappropriations bill funding the Commerce Department. Theadded language now is intended to apply the same restrictionsto those providing technical services, and committee stafferssaid the provision was opposed by United Technologies becauseof the impact on a subsidiary's application to participate ina Cape York, Australia, space facility that might use thecheaper Soviet or Chinese launchers.</TEXT></DOC>
