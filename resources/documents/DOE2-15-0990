In particular, alkaline emissionsenhance the base catalyzed heterogeneous sulfate formation reactions.Alternatively, photochemical reactions of hydrogen carbon and nitrogenoxide emissions lead to peroxide, ozone and nitric acid production. Thesespecies favor different mechanisms for sulfate formation. Texas offersan interesting example of spatial heterogeneity of acid and base precursoremissions. Sulfur oxide acid equivalent emissions are less than nitrogenoxide acid equivalent fluxes for the state as a whole. The sulfur emissionsare localized and dominated by smelters in El Paso, oil production activitiesin the Permian Basin, petrochemical and refining on the Gulf Coast (Houston,Beaumont and Corpus Christi), and power production in the lignite beltand urban areas. The ammonia emission densities are highest in the Panhandleand East Texas, as a result of agricultural and natural sources. Thenitrogen oxides emissions from anthropogenic activities have a more uniformspatial distribution. An assessment of the interaction of these acidand base emissions was performed to determine which regions may be mostimpacted by urban plumes and industrial sources.</TEXT></DOC>
