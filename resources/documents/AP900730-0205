F.W. Dodge, a financial information division of McGraw-Hill,said its index of new construction contracts fell in June to 153from 156 in May.   Spending for new construction totaled $240.72 billion in June,compared with May's $245.71 billion.   Dodge said new non-building construction, which includes publicworks and utilities, fell 14 percent from May, when three publicworks contracts totaling $300 million had inflated spending in thatcategory.   Contracts for new non-residential construction, which includescommercial building, increased by 5 percent, while residentialconstruction spending fell 1 percent.   Despite the overall decline, Dodge found evidence thatconstruction spending was leveling off after having fallen to afour-year low in April. The Dodge index reached 181 in September,but then began to tumble, eventually dropping to 147 in April, asbuilders found financing harder to come by.   The index rebounded to 155 in May.   George A. Christie, Dodge's chief economist, said most of thevolatility in construction now appeared to be in the past. Recentfigures show the building market is stabilizing, Christie said in astatement.   Through the first half of the year, total new constructionspending fell 8 percent from the same period a year earlier, to$121.3 billion from $131.37 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
