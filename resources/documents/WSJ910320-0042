The company has received more than 300 reports of&quot;overheating&quot; of certain GE and Universal brands of DripCoffeemakers made in 1984 or earlier, according to documentsdrafted by GE for use in the recall process. Describing thedefective coffee makers as &quot;a potential fire hazard,&quot; GE saysin the documents that the appliances have been implicated infires resulting in more than two dozen personal-injury andproperty-damage claims.</LP><TEXT>   In some lawsuits, consumers contend that GE, which stoppedmaking coffee makers in 1984, has known of the problem forseveral years and should have alerted the public before nowof the potential hazard. Because of the alleged delay, someconsumers charge GE with reckless conduct and demand punitivedamages on top of payments for their actual losses, accordingto lawyers involved in the cases.   In answer to an inquiry, the Consumer Product SafetyCommission said yesterday that &quot;GE and {the commission} arediscussing the voluntary recall of GE Drip Coffeemakers.&quot; Aspokesman also urged consumers to discontinue use of thecoffee makers. He noted that GE Spacemaker coffee makerswouldn't be involved in a recall.   A spokesman for GE said the company is working with theConsumer Product Safety Commission to &quot;jointly decide what,if any, action needs to be taken.&quot; He added that it would be&quot;premature for us to conclude, until we are done with {thejoint discussions}, what, indeed, the action plans might be.&quot;He declined to comment more specifically.   The problems with the coffee makers are outlined inconfidential drafts of recall documents that GE has submittedto the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission inWashington. The agency, which will supervise the plannedrecall, is negotiating the final details of the process withthe company. The commission is responsible for protecting thepublic from unreasonable risks of injury from consumerproducts.   The number of coffee makers involved in the expectedrecall couldn't be determined precisely, but a person closeto the planning of the recall said it could total severalhundred thousand. The person also said GE is considering arebate to consumers of $5 to $10.   GE sold its small-appliance operations in 1984 to Black andamp;Decker Corp. A spokeswoman for Black andamp; Decker, based inTowson, Md., said, &quot;If there is a recall, it doesn't involveany Black andamp; Decker coffee maker.&quot; The recall would onlyinvolve &quot;General Electric-branded and General Electric-madeproducts.&quot; The spokeswoman added that she isn't aware of &quot;anyproblem that we've had with the successor Black andamp; Deckerproducts.&quot;   In the documents, GE blames the overheating problem on thefailure of a fuse that it bought from a supplier. Thedocuments don't identify the supplier. But a lawsuitresulting from the fatal Salt Lake City blaze names GE andEmerson Electric Co., among others, as defendants. Emerson,an electrical manufacturer based in St. Louis, didn't have animmediate comment.   The suit was filed in federal court in Salt Lake City bythe family of four-year-old Peter Elliott Clark and themother of 14-year-old Heather Sheehan. Both died in the fire,which occurred in 1989. Among other allegations, the suitcharges that the fire was caused by a GE coffee maker thatcontained an Emerson-supplied fuse. It also accuses GE andEmerson of knowing of hundreds of instances in which thecoffee makers failed.   The suit seeks actual damages of at least $25 million andpunitive damages totaling at least 1% of GE's and Emerson'snet worth.   According to the suit, the coffee-maker model involved inthe Salt Lake City fire was also the subject of a state courtsuit in Michigan between GE and Emerson. That litigation,filed in 1987, came two years before the Utah fire, accordingto the Clark suit. In the Michigan case, the Clark suitcharges, GE accused Emerson or its units of negligence in thedesign, manufacture or sale of the Emerson parts that GE usedin its coffee makers.   Noel Bailey, a Houston lawyer representing consumers inanother coffee-maker case against GE, said, &quot;We are allegingthat information {GE} had should have led to additionalrecalls. . . . GE should have issued warnings.&quot;   The recall would be the second in nine years involving GEdrip coffee makers in which the fuse was alleged to beflawed. After some 400 reports of overheating problems, GEand the Consumer Products Safety Commission announced arecall of 200,000 of the coffee makers. The fuse involved inthe earlier recall was slightly different from those used insubsequent models, lawyers for consumers say.   Last August, Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex Inc. and theConsumer Product Safety Commission began a voluntary recallof certain discontinued models of drip coffee makers withdefects allegedly involving fuses. That recall involved anestimated 800,000 coffee makers. Proctor-Silex had receivedabout 180 reports that the coffee makers caught fire. Thecompany, 80%-owned by Nacco Industries Inc., says some claimsof property damage are pending.</TEXT></DOC>
