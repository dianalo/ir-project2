William Lozano, 30, was convicted last month on two counts ofmanslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed black motorcyclist ona street in the Overtown section, sending the vehicle crashing intoa car and killing the motorcycle's passenger.   ``This court cannot do perfect justice in this case,'' said DadeCircuit Judge Joseph Farina, who called the deaths and resultanttrial a ``tragic incident.''   The Colombian-born officer showed little reaction as the judgeread the sentence, but his supporters cheered when Farina said theofficer could remain free on $10,000 bond pending appeals.   The Jan. 16, 1989, deaths led to the city's fourth round ofracial unrest in the 1980s, all linked to the killings of blacks bywhite officers. In two of those cases, acquittals of the policemenhad sparked racial violence, and police braced for renewed riotingas Lozano's trial neared an end last month. But on Dec. 7, aracially mixed jury convicted Lozano.   Police said the city was quiet after Wednesday's sentencing.   ``Everything is good, there's no disturbance, no nothing,'' saidpolice spokesman George Law.   After the sentence, Lozano stared briefly at lead prosecutorJohn Hogan, but said nothing.   Lozano thanked his supporters at a news conference later andpredicted he would be vindicated through appeal.   ``My attorney, my family and I will continue to fight within thesystem for what is right, and at the end, I will win,'' he said.   Outside the courtroom, Patricia Lloyd, sister of slainmotorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, said only: ``I wish it had beenlonger.''   Ray Fauntroy, head of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference here, said he was disappointed with the sentence.   Blacks ``get seven years just for stealing a loaf of bread,''Fauntroy said. ``This officer was just given a pat on the back.He'll be out in two or three years.   Hogan, who had recommended a 12-year sentence, said he wassatisfied.   ``It's a just sentence,'' he said.   Lozano could have faced a punishment of 12 to 17 years understate sentencing guidelines.   Lozano and his attorneys left by a back door and did notimmediately speak to waiting reporters. But mostly Hispanicsupporters clapped as they filed out of the courtroom.   The convicted officer's mother, Haydee Lozano, recounted thefamily's struggles in the United States and said her son workedfrom the time he was 9 to help the family.   ``We are not people to destroy, but unite,'' she said through atranslator. ``Leave my son free.''   Defense attorneys from the beginning bitterly criticized thecase as an effort to ease racial tensions in Miami rather than givetheir client a fair trial.   ``If Officer Lozano was black, he never would have been chargedwith a crime. If the two people on the motorcycle were white, henever would have been charged with a crime,'' defense attorney MarkSeiden told the judge.   Earlier, the judge turned aside defense efforts to force aretrial, dismissing their arguments that the case was replete withmistakes.   Defense attorney Roy Black said the judge had unfairly preventedthe defense from challenging a black union official during juryselection and he said the atmosphere of violence surrounding thecase should have persuaded the judge to move the trial out of tenseMiami.   Before the sentencing, Lloyd's mother called for justice for herson. Adina Lloyd praised the conduct of the trial and told thejudge to use his conscience.   But at one point she turned to Lozano and said: ``If it was myson that did it to him, my son would be behind bars now.''   Lozano shot and killed Lloyd as he fled from a police carpursuing him for running a stop sign. Lloyd's passenger, AllanBlanchard, 24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcyclecrashed.   Ellis Rubin, attorney for Blanchard's family, called the trial aturning point for the community.   ``For too long in Dade County Florida, the black minority hasfelt ignored, felt frustrated, felt there was no equal justiceunder the law,'' Rubin said.   But he said a ``spark was lit'' by the Lozano verdict, tellingthe judge ``we ask you not to douse that spark of justice.''   Police spokesman Sgt. David Rivero described the sentence asaverage for someone convicted of manslaughter.   ``This is a democratic system, and we (police officers) have toaccept that,'' he said of the sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
