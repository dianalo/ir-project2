(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Karen Ann Quinlan's lapse into an irreversiblecoma in 1975 sparked a debate over a person's right to die thatcontinues today as some people with severe disabilities such as AIDSseek death over suffering.   Efforts by Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould in 1986 to get custody ofher child after acting as a surrogate mother turned attention to``reproductive issues,'' most recently involving frozen embryos.   Judges, legal experts, physicians and ethicists gathering thisweek say the 1990s will bring more life and death issues to thecourts.   ``We have to give judges some medical and ethical background fromwhich to decide these cases,'' said Judge Gladys Kessler, associatejudge in the District of Columbia Superior Court. ``The judiciary istaking the lead in this area, not because we want to but becausewe're being forced to.   ``Things are moving so fast. And legislatures, usually forpolitical reasons, don't seem to want to address these issues. And Idon't blame them. There's usually no right or wrong. Only ethicaldilemmas,'' added Kessler, who will be a lecturer at the conference.   Chief justices in each state have been invited to send two judgesapiece to the first National Conference of the Judiciary onBioethical Issues, to be held Thursday through Sunday.   Twenty national organizations, including the American MedicalAssociation and the American Bar Association, also have been askedto send two delegates each.   ``We wanted to hold the conference because these issues must bediscussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back totheir states,'' said Thomas Russell, associate dean of the NationalJudicial College, a school for judges on the University ofNevada-Reno campus.   ``Judges are expected to be wise and philosophical about thesecases. But they're almost always very emotional issues, and a judgemust reach a solution that involves the least amount of turmoil foreveryone.''   More than 150 participants are expected at the conference paidfor by the State Justice Institute and co-sponsored by the college,The Women Judges' Fund for Justice and the Institute of Public Law.   John Robertson, another lecturer for the meeting and a professorat the University of Texas School of Law, said judges must learn thelatest medical information to make sound decisions in cases wherethey're often pressed for time.   ``We've got to start developing rules because these cases areonly going to get more complicated as technology develops,''Robertson said. ``And there isn't any precedent or law to follow inmost cases.''   In one such case, a Tennesee judge in a divorce trial has todecide on the husband's request to stop his estranged wife fromusing seven frozen embryos they created through an in vitrofertilization program.   A federal court is reviewing a case in which a couple is suingthe Jones Reproductive Medicine Institute of Norfolk, Va., forpossession of their frozen embryo. The couple moved to Californialast year, and the clinic refused to ship it.   The latest ``right to die'' case surfaced last week whenGeorgia's attorney general supported a quadriplegic's request toturn off the respirator that keeps him alive. He wants a judge tolet him activate a timer with his mouth to turn off a ventilator hehas used since his neck was broken in a 1985 motorcycle accident.   The legality of authorities or friends assisting with suicidealso has been an issue among AIDS patients and care-givers.</TEXT></DOC>
