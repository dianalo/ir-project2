The main results include: (1) the residential, commercial,or industrial consumption of a fuel good is price- and income-inelasticin the short run and is elastic or becomes more elastic in the long run;(2) the speed of adjustment differs from a fuel good to another for differentuses in different (sub)regions; (3) the patterns of the demand for afuel good are not uniform within or across (sub) regions; (4) there aredifferences in the behavior of energy consumption because of geographicallocations as well as similarities because of geographical conditions;(5) the cross-price elasticities imply the existence of substitutabilityand complementarity among the three types of fuel goods; (6) in the longrun, the demand for a fuel commodity in different consuming sectors exhibitsa relatively large degree of volatility in response to changes in itsown price, the prices of other fuel goods, and income; and (7) consideringthe USA as a whole, it is found that residential consumption of naturalgas, electricity and heating oil is more elastic with respect to pricethan to income in the short and long run; that residential, commercialand industrial demand for electricity are income-inelastic in the shortand long run, but commercial and industrial use of natural gas and electricityare more sensitive to both price and income than residential demand inthe short and long run, and that the speed of adjustment for heatingoil is relatively slower than for natural gas and electricity. Thesefindings bear important implications for US energy policies. 42 refs.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
