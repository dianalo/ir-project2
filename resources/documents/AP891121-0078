(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Schoolchildren clasping their parents'hands returned to class today for the first time since a tornadokilled seven classmates in the cafeteria.   Flowers were piled high outside the cafeteria wall, but with astiff wind whipping the American flag on its flagpole nearby, fewpeople paused at the boarded-up wall at East Coldenham ElementarySchool.   Children riding school buses waved and smiled as they passedreporters and police clustered at the end of the driveway to the270-student school. Reporters were kept away from the school, andschool officials had no comment.   Seven 7- and 8-year-olds were killed and 18 others injured lastThursday when a tornado slammed into the cafeteria wall, rainingglass and concrete on students having lunch.   Dozens of pupils visited the damaged cafeteria on Monday. Thoughstudents and their parents were encouraged to look at thecafeteria, they won't eat lunch there any time soon, PrincipalHarvey Gregory said.   The cafeteria carries the spray-painted epitaph: ``Pray for theChildren.''   More than 20 counselors were on hand Monday and were to returntoday.   In some ways, the hardest task was reassuring parents, Gregorysaid.   ``Students are very resilient,'' Gregory said. ``They get backvery quickly. But parents _ dealing with the fears and traumas.`How do I send my kid back into the cafeteria?' I can reassureparents now that they will never go back into that cafeteria in itspresent form.''   Funerals were held Monday for five young victims and two wereheld Saturday. Eleven of the 18 injured children remainedhospitalized, two in critical condition.   Compounding the tragedy, a 5-year-old East Coldenham pupil,Rosalie Sbordone, died Monday from injuries suffered in a caraccident the day before. The accident happened only a few hundredyards from the school, but was unrelated to the steady stream ofmourners there, police said.   At the school, Sheryl Pressel choked back sobs while leavingwith her 10-year-old son, Billy, who wasn't hurt.   ``What amazes me are some of the parents of the children thatdied are in there today,'' Pressel said. ``I don't think I couldhandle that. If I had a child that I lost in that school, Iwouldn't want to go back in there.''   Billy said he ``felt sort of regular'' coming back to the schoolfor the first time since the tornado.   ``All I felt was a little sadness,'' he said. ``It helped me alittle.''   Parents leaving the school stopped their cars to watch thefuneral procession for 8-year-old Maria Stumer pass.   Rooms at the reopened school were set aside for adults andchildren to slip off to if they become upset, said Horst Graefe,director of personnel for the Valley Central School District.   It will cost nearly $400,000 to rebuild the cafeteria wall, butschool Superintendent James Coonan said he wants to make it look asdifferent as possible, with less glass.   ``We'll do anything to make it comfortable for the kids,'' hesaid. ``If we have to make like booths in McDonald's, we will.''  </TEXT></DOC>
