Despite an expected slower rate of growth, the world's population in that year should represent a 27% increase from the mid-1985 total of 4.9 billion people, the forecast said. The globe had 3.7 billion inhabitants as recently as 1970.    The populations of developing countries still will be growing at least three times faster than developed nations by the end of the century, the census report said. Three-fourths of the world population now lives in developing countries. </TEXT></DOC>
