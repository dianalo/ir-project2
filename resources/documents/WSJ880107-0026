A weak trend on Wall Street during the London afternoon curbed the market's early gains there. The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 0.9 point at 1438.0. Volume was 607.5 million shares, up from 585.5 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 2.5 points at 1787.1, just above the day's low.    Dealers said the market lost its earlier gains during the last hour of trading after Wall Street eased. The London market hit its intraday peak before the New York market opened, as participants reacted to the continuing strength of the dollar in currency dealings.    Shares were boosted by some good institutional buying, concentrated notably in British Petroleum Co. new shares. Stock exchange volume in the shares, which counts both the buy and the sell side of each transaction, totaled 108 million, or just less than one-fifth of the exchange's total volume. The heavy trading raised speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office was building on its already declared 18.34% stake in BP with continuing purchases of partly paid shares. BP new shares were up 4 pence at 76 pence ($1.38). BP fully paid shares were up 1 at 264.    The Bank of England's offer to repurchase the new partly paid shares at 70 pence each ended Wednesday, but analysts said the BP share price rise in recent days means the bank won't have to buy a large quantity of the shares.    Investors tendered only a &quot;very modest proportion&quot; of the 2.19 billion new ordinary shares under the buy-back offer, a spokesman for the central bank said. The exact number of shares submitted under the buy-back won't be known until tomorrow or Monday. The government announced the repurchase arrangement in October, to prevent a sudden collapse in the BP share price following the company's #7.2 billion ($13.14 billion) share issue, which coincided with the stock market collapse.    U.K. companies with large dollar earnings rose early in the day when the dollar surged, but fell back when the U.S. unit retreated later from the day's high. Among the large dollar-earners, Glaxo Holdings was up 6 pence at #10.34 ($18.86), Imperial Chemical Industries rose 20 to 11.65 and BTR was up 4 at 286.    Frankfurt share prices rose after the dollar jumped, brokers said. The dollar's gains were attributed to a Japanese news report that the U.S., West Germany and Japan had set a target for the dollar between 125 and 140 yen, or somewhat more than 1.65 marks.    But a small amount of profit-taking prevented the Frankfurt market from rising as fast as it had the previous session. Interest focused on the auto sector, which had been depressed by fears that the dollar's drop to record lows would squeeze the sector's export earnings.    &quot;The market's gains were exclusively due to the dollar,&quot; said a senior bourse official at a big West German bank, who cautioned that many investors remain skeptical about the dollar's sudden surge and thus were reluctant to invest heavily.    Also gaining were some machinery shares that would especially benefit from the higher dollar. Linde gained 14 marks to 529 marks ($324.85). Deutsche Babcock was up 8.50 at 163.50. Kloeckner Humboldt Deutz rose 3.90 to 87.90.    Among auto issues, Daimler-Benz advanced 17 to 590, while Bayerische Motoren Werke was up 6.50 at 467 and Volkswagen gained 4 to 221.    Deutsche Bank was up 15 at 409, Commerzbank rose 2.50 to 216, and Dresdner Bank advanced 0.50 to 232.    Chemical stock Bayer was up 4 at 268, while Hoechst gained 2.80 to 255.30 and BASF advanced 2.50 to 255.50.    Among retailers, Horten gained 4 to 158, after a news report that Horten's majority holder, B.A.T Industries PLC, was preparing to sell its stake in the department store chain to Frankfurt-based Hertie Group. The report was denied by both Hertie and B.A.T's West German holding group.    Elsewhere in Europe, stocks closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam. Stock markets were closed in Stockholm, Milan and Madrid.    In Paris, the moderately higher close came as the market responded to the dollar's gains, firm share prices abroad, and a decline in French interest rates. Brokers said buying interest was initially fueled by Tuesday's decision by the Bank of France to lower its key lending rates by one-quarter percentage point, which raised hopes about growth, investment and domestic demand. The dollar's climb also aided investors' confidence in Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam.    Share prices closed higher in Taipei, Hong Kong, Wellington, Sydney, Manila and Singapore. Again, favorable response to the dollar's rebound was cited.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                     Jan 5    Jan 4    Year    U.S. ........................... 239.9    237.6   +  5.2    Britain ........................ 540.0    527.0   +  8.5    Canada ......................... 361.3    358.4   +  8.5    Japan ......................... 1010.1   1000.1   +  6.9    France ......................... 295.4    285.4   - 27.6    Germany ........................ 154.4    148.3   - 40.6    Hong Kong ..................... 1713.4   1631.4   -  3.7    Switzerland .................... 144.2    138.3   - 28.2    Australia ...................... 257.9    253.9   -  2.3    World index .................... 406.6    407.6   + 14.0</TEXT></DOC>
