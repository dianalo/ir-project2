Lawmakers voted 51-45 to reject the proposals which had beenapproved by the General Synod, the church's governing body, and bythe House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament.   Approval by both house of Parliament is needed for such measuresaffecting the state church to become law.   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the spiritual leader ofthe Church of England and 70 millions Anglicans worldwide, supportedthe proposals, hoping they would boost the declining number ofclergy.   Runcie said the experience of a failed marriage could help othersfacing a similar situation and called on Parliament to ``lay stresson grace and forgiveness.''   Conservative lawmaker Sir John Stokes told the House of Commonshe feared the proposals ``would send out a wrong or confusing signalto ordinary people in England who are looking to the church and theclergy to set high standards.''   Debate on the proposals was delayed until early Tuesday byseveral other items of parliamentary business the government wantsto clear up before the summer recess begins July 28. By then, manyof the 650 members of Parliament had gone home.   Lord Hailsham, Britain's former chief legal officer, called thevote ``unrepresentative and foolish.''   ``You can't test a man's vocation to become a priest by amajority in Parliament. It has to be done by the churchauthorities,'' he said.   The ban on ordination for remarried divorced men, or those whosespouses have been divorced, has long been regarded as an anomaly inthe Church of England because ordained clergy can be divorcedwithout losing their posts.</TEXT></DOC>
