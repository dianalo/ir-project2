Gorbachev's plan tounilaterally cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons and called onMoscow not to stop there.   ``We consider reduction in 500 weapons alone as a welcome,positive, but rather modest step,'' NATO said in a statement afterU.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed his trip toMoscow this week with senior officials of the 15 other NATO nations.   NATO already has removed 2,400 nuclear arms in the past decade,the statement said.   ``Our levels are much lower than those of the Soviet Union,'' itsaid and added that NATO looks to Moscow to make further``reductions in its unwarranted superiority.''   NATO estimates the Soviet Union has 1,450 short-range nuclearmissile launchers in Europe, against 88 for the Western alliance.   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, traveling withPresident Bush to Texas, took a harder approach to Gorbachev'splan. He told reporters he thought it ``is designed principally tocreate problems within the alliance ... divisions within theWestern alliance.''   Baker discussed with the allies a new challenge by Gorbachev tocut not only short-range nuclear weapons but tanks, troops andaircraft in Europe as well.   The NATO meeting was attended by seven foreign ministers,including Baker and West Germany's Hans-Dietrich Genscher, andsenior officials of the 16 NATO nations.   The Soviet offer to cut 500 short-range nuclear weapons comes ata time when NATO is buffeted by an internal dispute over whether tomodernize its 88 Lance missiles. The issue is expected to dominatea May 29-30 NATO summit here.   Baker met separately here with Genscher, who wants NATO to delaythe modernization of the Lance missiles until the early 1990s andbegin talks on reducing short-range nuclear arms with the SovietUnion.   At the outset of their session at NATO headquarters, a reporterasked Baker if he planned to ``bury the hatchet'' with Genscher.``There is no hatchet,'' replied Baker.   Baker was also met separately with Dutch Foreign Minister Hansvan den Broek whose country is one of several NATO members tryingto mediate in the modernization debate that has pitted Britain andthe United States against West Germany and several other allies.   The secretary of state at a news conference acknowledged he wasunable to persuade West Germany to back off its demands for U.S.negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce nuclear missiles inEurope. After meeting with Genscher, Baker said he still washopeful for a settlement before the meeting later this month.   ``It has not, as yet, been resolved,'' Baker said.   Many of the 16 allies are lined up with West Germany, while theUnited States has the strong support of Britain and a handful ofothers. The Germans also are balking at U.S.efforts to more thantriple the range of the short-range U.S. Lance nuclear missiles,most of which are based on German soil.   ``It is a very, very important issue, involving as it doesquestions of alliance security,'' Baker said.   After a ``full exchange'' on the issue, Baker said he hopedGenscher ``better understands our position.''   On another sensitive issue, there was apparent NATO unity asBaker briefed seven foreign ministers and other Western officialson his talks with Gorbachev. The secretary of state said the Sovietproposal to withdraw 500 battlefield nuclear weapons was``apparently designed for public opinion'' and had not guaranteedthe weapons would be destroyed.   Baker told Gorbachev at their meeting in the Kremlin this weekhe opposes talks on short-range nuclear weapons saying the WarsawPact was so far ahead in tactical nuclear weapons the United Statescould not even consider negotiations until there was ``a littleless of an imbalance.''   The unilateral cuts Gorbachev intends to make this year include284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear bombs carried by airplanesand 50 nuclear artillery shells.   In Moscow, Gorbachev also moved boldly on the conventionalweapons front telling Baker he would offer to cut Warsaw Pact tanksby 40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000, and artillery pieces by47,000, a U.S. official said.   Other elements of the plan include a reduction of 1 milliontroops in both alliances and a 55 percent reduction in NATO'scombat aircraft.   By 1997, the official said, Gorbachev is aiming for equal levelsof 1.35 million troops in the two alliances 1,500 strike aircraftand 20,000 tanks.   The ceilings in other areas would be 1,700 helicopters, 24,000artillery pieces and 28,000 combat vehicles.   Baker declined to evaluate the proposal But the U.S. officialsaid he had told Gorbachev that it would be up to the NATO allianceto reply.</TEXT></DOC>
