(a) The SBA advises an agency through a search letter of an 8(a) firm'scapabilities and asks the agency to identify acquisitions to support thefirm's business plans. In these instances, the SBA will provide at leastthe following information in order to enable the agency to match an acquisitionto the firm's capabilities. (1) Identification of the concern and its owners. (2) Background information on the concern, including any and all informationpertaining to the concern's technical ability and capacity to perform.(3) The firm's present production capacity and related facilities.

(b) The SBA identifies a specific requirement for a particular 8(a) firmor firms and asks the agency to offer the acquisition to the 8(a) programfor the firm(s). In these instances, in addition to the information inparagraph (a) of this section, the SBA will provide_(1) A clear identification of the acquisition sought; e.g., project nameor number; (2) A statement as to how any additional needed facilities will be providedin order to ensure that the firm will be fully capable of satisfying theagency's requirements; and (3) If a sole source request: (i) The reasons why the firm is consideredsuitable for this particular acquisition; e.g., previous contracts forthe same or a similar supply or service; and (ii) a statement that thefirm is eligible in terms of STC code, business support levels, and businessactivity targets. (4) If competitive, a statement identifying at least two 8(a) firms consideredcapable of satisfying the agency's requirements which are also eligiblein terms of the SIC code, business support levels, and business activitytargets. (c) Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the purposeof identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA. Where agenciesindependently, or through the self-marketing efforts of an 8(a) firm, identifya requirement for the 8(a) program, they may offer on behalf of a specific8(a) firm, for the 8(a) program in general, or for 8(a) competition. <ITAG tagnum="80">19.804 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Evaluation, offering, and acceptance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">19.804-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Agency evaluation.</ITAG>In determining the extent to which a requirement should be offered in supportof the 8(a) program, the agency should evaluate_(a) Its current and future plans to acquire the specific items or workthat the SBA's contractor is seeking to provide, identified in terms of_(1) Quantities required or the number of construction projects planned;and (2) Performance or delivery requirements, including required monthly productionrates, when applicable.

(c) On a limited basis, the SBA Associate Administrator for Minority SmallBusiness and Capital Ownership Development, may approve an agency recommendationfor a competitive 8(a) award below the competitive thresholds. The agencyrecommendation may be included in the offering letter or may be submittedby separate correspondence through the SBA region or headquarters, dependingupon whether the acquisition is a local or national buy requirement. Agencyrecommendations for competition below the threshold will be given favorableconsideration primarily in acquisitions requiring formal technical evaluationor where a large number of responsible 8(a) firms are available for thecompetition. <ITAG tagnum="80">19.805-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures. </ITAG>(a) Competitive 8(a) acquisitions shall be conducted by contacting agenciesby using sealed bids (see Part 14) or competitive proposals (see Part 15).(b) Offers will be solicited from those sources identified in accordancewith the SBA instructions provided in accordance with 19.804-3. (c) Upon receipt of offers, the contracting officer will provide the SBAa copy of the solicitation and the fair market price and, in a sealed bidacquisition, a list of offerors ranked in the order of their standing foraward; i.e., first low, second low, etc., with the total evaluated pricefor each offer, differentiating between basic and any options. In negotiatedacquisition, in addition to a copy of the solicitation and fair marketprice, the contracting officer will submit an unranked list of offerorswithin the competitive range. Actual offered prices in a negotiated acquisitionwill not be submitted or revealed to SBA. The SBA will determine the offerors'business support level and business activity target potential eligibilityon the basis of the estimated fair market price. (d) Within 5 working days after receipt of the list of offerors, SBA willdetermine eligibility of the firms for award of the contract and advisethe contracting officer. Eligibility is based on whether the firm has theSIC code for this acquisition in its approved business plan, whether thefirm is currently small under the SIC code, whether the firm is in developmentalor transitional stage (if the acquisition is restricted by stage), whetherthe firm has exeeded its approved business support level, and whether thefirm is in conformance with its 8(a) buisness activity targets. In sealedbid acquisitions, SBA will consider the eligibility of the first low bidder.If the first low bidder is not determined eligible, SBA will consider theeligibility of the next low bidder until an eligible bidder is identified.In negotiated acquisitons, SBA will determine the eligibility of all firmswithin the competitive range. If the contracting officer has not receiveda response from SBA within the 5-day period, the contracting officer maycontinue to process the acquisition but should recognize that SBA willnot enter into the resultant contract unless the offeror is eligible. (e) Once eligibility has been established by SBA, the successful offerorwill be determined by the contracting activity in accordance with normalcontracting procedures. <ITAG tagnum="80">19.806 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Pricing the 8(a) contract. </ITAG>(a) The contracting officer shall price the 8(a) contract in accordancewith Subpart 15.8.

(b) In estimating the fair market price for an acquisition other than thosecovered in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer shalluse price or cost analysis and consider commercial prices for similar productsand services, available in house cost estimates, data (including cost orpricing data) submitted by the SBA or its contractor, and data obtainedfrom any other Government agency. (c) In estimating a fair market price for a repeat purchase, the contractingofficer shall consider recent award prices for the same items or work ifthere is comparability in quantities, conditions, terms, and performancetimes. The estimated price should be adjusted to reflect differences inspecifications, plans, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs,and other circumstances. Price indices may be used as guides to determinethe changes in labor and material costs. Comparison of commercial pricesfor similar items may also be used. <ITAG tagnum="80">19.808 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract negotiation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">19.808-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Sole source. </ITAG>(a) The SBA is responsible for initiating negotiations with the agencywithin the time established by the agency.
