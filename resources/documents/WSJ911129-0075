The rules are intended to prevent firms from underpayingforeigners on non-immigrant visas. But employers say theywould result in wage inflation for both foreign and U.S.workers, making it prohibitive to hire foreigners with skillstough to find here.   Universities, which recruit heavily abroad for teachingand research posts, are especially worried. The University ofAlabama in Tuscaloosa recently froze hiring of non-immigrantworkers until the rules are clarified.   Ironically, the rules stem from the Immigration Act of1990, which seeks to enhance the U.S. work pool andcompetitiveness. The act, which became law Oct. 1, tightenscurbs on non-immigrant work visas, known as H-1B visas, thatare widely used by employers to speedily hire foreignprofessionals, from investment bankers to physicists. A newrequirement calls for employers to give the Labor Departmentdocumentation attesting that the foreign hire and othersimilarly employed workers will be paid the &quot;actual wagerate&quot; at the firm or the area's prevailing wage for the job,whichever is higher.   Employers had carped that the changes added red tape, butit wasn't until last month that they realized the rules couldescalate wages. One snag is the vagueness of the term &quot;actualwage.&quot; Some lawyers raise this scenario: ABC Co. is hiring aforeigner on an H-1B visa as a mechanical engineer butalready has two such engineers, one earning $50,000, theother $45,000. The firm must pay at least $47,500, theaverage &quot;actual wage,&quot; not only to the new engineer, but alsoto the lowerpaid employee, regardless of merit, the lawyerssay. And if the prevailing wage in the area is $48,000, theysay, ABC must pay the two engineers at least $48,000.   &quot;It's last-minute, inadvertent and unintended,&quot; saysStephen Trow, a Washington lawyer whose client, atelecommunications company, is afraid to hire a foreignspecialist whom it took one year to find. The LaborDepartment is drafting a clarification, says Grace Kilbane,head of the department's immigration task force. Whilewarning that it's difficult to judge hypothetical situations,she concedes that a foreigner hired at a higher wage couldset the rate for U.S. workers if there's no distinction inqualification or job.                                                                                                          Recruiters Bump Heads   Against `Glass Ceiling'                                                                                                          GOVERNMENT'S VOW to smash the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; for womenand minority-member managers catches recruiters in thespotlight.   As the Labor Department probes companies' compliance,headhunters also come under scrutiny. &quot;The relationshipbetween the {federal} contractor and executive-search firm isa big issue for us,&quot; says an official. The departmentenforces nondiscrimination laws as they apply to federalcontractors.   Recruiters' role in building the glass ceiling got noticelast August in a widely publicized department review of ninebig companies. The companies often neglected to tellrecruiters of their equal-opportunity obligations or theirdesire that referrals be made from a diversified pool ofcandidates, the department said, calling this failure abarrier to advancement. But it isn't clear how far the LaborDepartment can go in policing the recruiters that companieshire. Although the department's focus is on contractorsmeeting their obligations, the official says she won't ruleout the possibility of search firms being found in violation.   Although headhunters say they feel no pressure from theLabor Department, they are exercising caution. In June, theAssociation of Executive Search Consultants, New York, addedan anti-bias clause to its guidelines.                                                                                                          Not All the Movers   Are Typical Shakers                                                                                                          TO RELOCATION specialists, their typical assignmentremains a white married male in his mid-30s with two kids.But making up a growing group are women, members ofminorities and single people, who have differentpreoccupations when they ponder a move.   Women, for instance, may want career assistance forhusbands moving with them, and single parents often need morehelp in finding schools and day care than two-parentfamilies.   In a Runzheimer International study, 20% of employeesrelocated in 1990 were &quot;atypical.&quot; Singles made up 19%, upfrom 16% in 1988. The percentage of women rose to 16% from12%, and 11% were &quot;trailing husbands,&quot; up from 7%. Singleparents grew to 11% from 6%. &quot;It's not a Paul Revere issue,but it's happening all the time,&quot; says Greg Brewer, editor ofRunzheimer Reports on Relocation newsletter.   Only 19% of the companies that had atypical transfereesgave them special help, down slightly from 1989. Somecompanies argue that their relocation policies are flexibleenough to satisfy diverse demands. Employees of MinnesotaMining andamp; Manufacturing can feel out the community they aremoving to through an &quot;acclimation&quot; service provided by CareerDevelopment Services, a Rochester, N.Y., consultant. Theservice imparts such nuggets as support networks for singleparents to lists of roommate agencies and African-Americanchurches.
