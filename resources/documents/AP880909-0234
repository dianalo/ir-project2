The Wall Street Journal reported today that the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office, which has been conducting a parallel probe ofDrexel, had issued ``target letters'' to the firm's junk-bond chiefMichael Milken and at least four others, indicating they will seekcriminal indictments of them soon.   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying the letterswere issued when the SEC filed its civil charges in Manhattanfederal court against Drexel, Milken and others late Wednesday.Attorneys for Milken and the other prospective defendants declinedcomment, as did the U.S. attorney's office.   Lawyers watching from the sidelines said the SEC-Drexelconfrontation probably would be the decade's biggest securities lawstory and they expected the securities firm to scrap it out incourt.   ``It's hard to say they welcome the suit, but I suspect theywelcome the opportunity to fight out in the open as opposed todealing with innuendos,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New Yorksecurities attorney.   Others said Drexel attorneys likely would aggressively requestinformation from the SEC in the pretrial fact-gathering process,known as discovery. Under civil-law procedures, the SEC must complywith many of these requests.   Some lawyers familiar with the SEC's enforcement strategies saidDrexel now enjoys a significant advantage because it had reservedtens of millions of dollars for a legal brawl and retained talentedattorneys to face a budget-strapped federal agency with seasonedinvestigators but rookie trial lawyers.   ``The commission is superb at conducting investigations, butonce it moves into the litigation arena, it doesn't have the samestrengths,'' said one former SEC attorney now in private practice,who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name.   ``This is going to be a scorched earth defense; you press themas hard as you can,'' the attorney said. ``You come out withdiscovery, press them with all kinds of document requests and amore detailed articulation of the charges. That will keep them onthe defensive.''   Representing Drexel is a battery of attorneys that includes theNew York firm of Cahill, Gordon and Reindel, which has a highlyskilled litigation staff. Drexel ``junk bond'' chief MichaelMilken, another key defendant, has retained a legal defense forcethat includes Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, anotherhigh-powered New York firm.   Nevertheless, the Drexel-SEC court battle could be weeks andeven months away, largely because the case may stall until the U.S.attorney's office finishes a criminal investigation of the firm.   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, known to haveimpaneled a grand jury inquiry of Drexel, could intervene to haltthe civil discovery process if he believes it would compromise hiseffort.   Although there has been widespread speculation that the criminalprobe may be completed over the next several weeks, federalprosecutors persistently have declined to confirm or deny it.   The people familiar with Drexel's strategy said seniorexecutives already had acted to calm staffers nervous about thescope and seriousness of the SEC's civil charges.   They contended the charges contained no surprises and appearedto mirror what Drexel's lawyers anticipated after the SEC disclosedto the firm in late May that it had authorized an enforcementaction.   At the same time, these people said, Drexel's attorneys hadstarted preparing documents to demand the SEC's evidence. They saida conference of both sides was expected soon before U.S. DistrictJudge Milton Pollack, who was assigned the case.   The SEC charged in a 184-page complaint filed Wednesday inManhattan federal court that from 1984 to 1986, Drexel secretlyschemed with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky to cheat thefirm's clients, trade illegally on inside information, manipulatestocks, lie to the government and falsify records.   The enforcement agency depicted Drexel and key employees assystematically having violated a range of securities laws involvingsome of the biggest takeover deals of the decade, in which Drexeloften played a role as financier. The defendants have deniedwrongdoing and predicted vindication.</TEXT></DOC>
