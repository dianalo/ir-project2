It was expected thatthe current density of the superconductor would be high. The effect ofthe short compression molding process or the particle orientation ofYBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub y/ was examined by the high-temperature uniaxialcompression test. Powder of rhombic YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub y/ ceramicalone was put in a metallic mold and uniaxially compressed at 950{sup0}C for approximately eight minutes. The sectional areas of the materialsintered in a disk shape in the mold perpendicular and parallel to thecompression axis were measured by X-ray refractometry. The result indicatesthat the (00l) face of crystal is remarkably oriented to the directionperpendicular to the compression axis. (4 figs, 1 tab, 2 photos, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
