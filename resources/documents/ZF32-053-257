 We tested a late beta-version, butwe're confident enough to give it a PC User Gold.andM;So what is Organizer?andP;  The simplest description is something like 'afilofax-style personal organiser for Windows'.andM;Certainly, that's the immediate visual impression.andP;  But if that's all therewas to it, we wouldn't be giving Organizer this intensive coverage--and wowouldn't be putting it on the front cover.andP;  It brings personal dataorganisation, time allocation booking and a whole raft of other usefulfeatures to the Windows desktop.andM;It applies to the individual, but it's also genuine groupware.andP;  And it's allwrapped up in a simple-to-use interface that, in many ways, set newstandards.andM;The sectionsandM;The Organizer consists of six different section types: Diary, ToDo, Planner,Address, Notepad and Anniversary.andP;  Be default, you get one of each section inthe Organizer 'book', but you can add or remove sections, and rename them asyou wish.andP;  So it's quite feasible to have four different Planner sections,two Notepads and a Diary.andM;This is one of the major strengths of Organizer: it doesn't have a sectionwhich is recognisably the 'centre of operations'.andP;  Instead, the coretechnology is the design of the multiple databases and the book system inwhich they reside.andP;  Despite being made up of multiple database sections, allthe underlying data is actually stored in one Organizer data file)  Eachsection closed resembles its familiar paper equivalent, so there's aremarkably easy learning curve, because most people already understand thebasic concepts.andM;In addition, the latest techniques of 'drag-and-drop' are fully implemented;this means users can easily modify entries.andP;  There'd be little point enteringlots of data if its was clumsy to print out, so each section gets fullprinting functions.andM;Pre-defined paper types include the popular (and proprietary) Filofax, TimeManager and Franklin paper systems, and there's a good selection ofpre-defined label types.andP;  It's also very easy to define your own.andO;Double-sided printing and the facility to accommodate 'missing labels' arealso supported.andM;Linking the objectsandM;One of the major strengths of Organizer is that it's very easy to create aglobal integrated data system where 'the whole is greater than the sum of theparts'.andP;  This is done by cross-linking one data element with another.andP;  Simplyselect the Anchor icon and click on each of the two objects to be linked.andM;These objects can be within a single section or in two entirely differentsections.andP;  For example, linking a meeting with Person A in a diary with theirentry in an address section requires just three mouse clicks.andP;  And theselinks aren't simply point-to-point; you can build up chains of connections.andO;Having linked the meeting to Person A's address, why not link that to a pageof notes in the notepad?andP;  This would be of little use if it was difficult orclumsy to traverse the link list, it couldn't be easier.andM;When you link an object, a marker appears: click on it and a drop-down listshows an interconnected objects.andP;  &quot;You 'walk' this list in the normal fashionwith the mouse: when you lift the mouse button, you're taken straight to therelevant page.andP;  This is a very powerful system, because by linking commonobjects together, you can create your own tailored information system.andP;  Ifyou move an appointment in a chain, the links are updated to reflect the newposition.andM;NetworksandM;Organizer is highly networked-aware.andP;  It has direct support for MicrosoftNetworks, LAn Managers 1.x or 2.0 Basic, LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, Novell286/386 NetWare, Banyan Vines, DEC 10-Net, Pathworks, and PC-LAN.andP;  As anaddition, Threadz supplies a demonstration LAN driver so you can try out thenetwork facilities for yourself.andM;It doesn't matter which network driver is installed; the facilities andoperations are the same.andP;  This is because the network functions go through astandard Threadz network layer before reaching the specific network codeitself.andP;  Network installation is a breeze: install the application on to thenetwork and then run the OrgAdmin program.andP;  From there, you can load thesoftware onto other network servers and set up user accounts.andM;If you're running LAN Manager 2.0 or NetWare, OrgAdmin will interrogate thenetwork user accounts system and set up all your users' names for you.andP;  Inaddition, OrgAdmin can generate a workstation install script for the remotefileserver -- which greatly simplifies installation for remote users.andP;  And ifyou're already running Threadz' Pinboard application (see Gold review, PCUser, issue 167), you could send all users an active note which will performthe installation for them.andM;Site licensing is based on the number of concurrent users, so 200 users couldeasily work on a 100-user licence.andP;  Organizer works by sending 'packets',which are small data files, to be required addresses on the LAN.andP;  Each packetcontains a particular piece of booking data, and each Organizer applicationscans its hard disk directory for the arrival of such packets.andP;  This is thesame technology as Threadz' Pinboard.andP;  Connection to and disconnection fromremote servers is done automatically by each Organizer application from itsfileserver installation.andM;At present, the beta-release installation program makes too many assumptions,and we couldn't install Organizer in network mode on a Sage MainLAN setup --although this appears to be the fault of MainLAN itself.andP;  I've used Organizeron a LAN Manager 2.0 setup with no problems, and the Demo Network driversupports all the Organizer LAN functionality on a single machine.andM;Groupware facilitiesandM;When installed on a LAN, Organizer silently transforms itself into agroupware product.andP;  It's possible to set up meetings with other users byselecting the 'people' button on the diary entry button bar: pick theparticipants you require, and their diary bookings for that day are displayedin a window -- the system automatically reads their diaries to check for timeconflicts.andM;If there is such a conflict, you can get Organizer to search for the firstavailable slot which fits all the participants' diaries.andP;  This is anear-instantaneous operation -- provided the file is available to be read byOrganizer.andP;  When a time booking is issued, each user is notified of themeeting.andP;  They can simply accept the booking, at which point the data isautomatically inserted into their diary, or they can reject or delegate it toanother colleague on the network.andM;Rejection sends a message back to the meeting organiser, informing them ofthe rejection, together with the reason.andP;  Delegating a meeting is a veryclever facility, because Organizer does all the notification and re-issuingof bookings automatically.andP;  If the file of a particular user isn't available-- for example, when the WAN connection might have filed -- the user willstill be listed, but their diary entries are left greyed out.andP;  When they comeback on-line, they'll be informed of all the new meetings and can takeappropriate action.andM;To change the time of the a meeting, you simply drag it or modify its timeparameters in your diary.andP;  Organizer won't move the meeting automatically tothe new suggested time but instead, it'll send a message to the meeting'sorganiser for approval.andM;Problems and drawbacksandM;Organizer's file importing and exporting is a little limited.andP;  The programwill read files produced by the British DOS-oriented 'personal organiser'Portex, but there's no support for dBase files, for example.andP;  The most commonimport/export format will be CSV, the simplified ASCII Comma Separated Valuesfiles produced as an option by many spreadsheets and other packages.andM;The lack of external database manipulation tools is disappointing: itwould've been useful to have tools to apply mass changes to the Addressdatabase, for example.andP;  And the lack of support for dBase is a majoromission; it might have been possible to export the database for processing,then re-import it.andP;  Threadz intends to release a set of database utilities bythe end of the year to allow modifications to be performed on Organizerdatabases without disturbing any links.andM;It's also surprising to find no facilities that would allow Organizer to beused as a DDE address data server from other programs, such as Word forWindows.andP;  Although several beta releases had full OLE implementations, theseare being improved from the final release; Threadz argues that Microsofthasn't yet finished the OLE libraries, and that it'd be risky including OLEin Organizer until this is completed.andM;We must also record a considerable number of small bugs and some flakiness,the kind of thing you expect from beta releases.andP;  Towards the end, Threadzwas working at a furious pace: we received four releases within six days!andM;Last wordandM;This is an extraordinary application -- not so much in what it does, but it'ssuch a good implementation that you can find almost absurd levels of care andattention to detail.andP;  The degree of capability is impressive, too.andP;  Even inthis preview, it hasn't been possible to explore all the uses to which thiscore technology could be put.andM;Even though it'd make an excellent workgroup tool, Organizer would be worthbuying even if you only wanted to print pages for your filoFAX.andM;The major problem for Organizer is that it comes from a small software housewith limited budgets.andP;  If it was the latest wonder from a giant Americansoftware empire, it'd be on back-order for months.andP;  But Organizer deserves todo well.andP;  Dammitt, it deserves to take the Windows world by storm.andP;  IfWindows users are prepared to investigate it, and if the corporate MISdepartments are brave enough to show it to end-users, it'll become adefinitive 'must-have' product.andM;Past experience suggests the remaining flakiness will be cured before thefinal release.andP;  Meanwhile, we're sufficiently confident to award ThreadzOrganizer a PC User Gold.andP;  And those who say 'it's only a personal organiser-- so what?' should be taken out and shot.andM;SUPPORT AND PRICESandM;Storing all this information in Organizer would be very risky without a gooddegree of security in the system.andM;There are three levels of password-protection: one for full read/writeaccess, and two for different levels of public read-only access.andM;If you use password-protection, the databases are encrypted.andP;  If you forgetyour password, Organizer can decrypt the file for you.andP;  Threadz supplied alaserprinted first draft on the manual with the review system.andP;  It obviouslyhas extensive tutorial elements, which indicates a high level of care in thisarea.andM;Full context-sensitive help, including Shift-F1 help, will be provided,although the help file itself was inevitably skeletal in the late-beta testreleases which we examined.andM;The pricing is very reasonable: a two-user starter pack will cost 199 poundswith an initial launch offer on 99 pounds.andP;  Network user packs will cost 599pounds for five users.andM;THE CORPORATE VIEWandM;PC User spoke to a number of corporate users who were beta testers ofOrganizer, to get their reactions and to ascertain the likelihood of themactually implementing the product in their organisations.andM;Tim Hopkins, MIS manager for Europe at Pepsi Cola International, wasenthusiastic about the product: Pepsi already uses Threadz' Pinboard packageon a 100-machine Novell network.andP;  He said that he was reserving judgementuntil Organizer actually shipped, but there was a definite possibility thathis company would implement it as a pan-European package.andP;  &quot;If implemented,it'll become a standard part of the Pepsi portfolio,&quot; he said.andM;We also spoke to Simon Hall, project engineer at BBC Transmission Services.andO;He runs a large Novell network of around 160 computers, 100 per centcommitted to Windows, Word for Windows and Excel.andP;  Simon Hall is mostinterested in the telephone listing, group booking and planning facilities.andO;&quot;We're seriously evaluating the product, and may well implement it once wesee final release code,&quot; he said.andM;PEN ORGANIZERandM;Despite the effort that's gone into bringing the standard Windows version ofOrganizer this far, there are more surprises in store -- there's already aPen Windows version of Organizer.andP;  After all, the 'book' concept makes it anatural for the Pen environment.andP;  Gary Levell, chief programmer at Threadz,demonstrated Pen Organizer to PC User on a 386 machine with a mouse --unfortunately, Threadz isn't alone in not having a real Pen machine to workwith.andM;The product was stable and all the boxes could be drawn in, just as we hoped.andO;The performance was fine: character recognition took well under one second,and the resultant text was correctly placed on the pages.andP;  We were told thatimplementing the Pen version had been relatively easy, requiring minimalchanges to the code, because of the object oriented way in which the wholeOrganizer application had been designed.andM;Drag-and-drop was fully implemented, and the whole product looked polised --it's just waiting for the final release of Organizer code, some Pen machineson which to run, and a final release of Pen Windows.andP;  This is still indevelopment, but it looks very exciting for the Pen manufacturers.andP;  A Penmachine fitted with a wireless LAN system running Organizer is a verytempting prospect.andM;Below we see Pen Windows running Pen Organiser -- just waiting for thehardware to be released.andM;WILDER USES FOR ORGANIZERandM;The wildest uses for Organizer centre around the free-form Notepad section,not surprisingly.andM;Below is a personnel file containing pictures of each individual with anoverview of their job, background, hobbies and so on.andP;  Make this an includedread-only file, and it becomes a corporate-wide resource.andM;Alternatively, how about setting up a reference book which contains colourpictures of birds, together with some relevant information?andM;You could then cross-link all birds found in the UK and where they nest, forexample.andP;  All conceivable details could be added, thus creating a valuablereference.andM;ADVANCED USESandM;Since an Organizer file can contain as many or as few sections as yourequire, it's perfectly possible to create customised 'books'.andP;  This won't besufficient for creating your very own sections, but Threadz is promising anOrganizer Developer's Kit, containing pre-compiled modules and fullinstructions on customising sections; this will appeal to serious programmersand to corporate MIS departments.andM;Sections from other Organizer files can be included as read-only links: theyappear as normal sections, but can't be modified.andP;  This is ideal forcorporate WAN-wide data sections -- company telephone listings, for example,or personnel information.andP;  One drawback is that a read-only section can't belinked to using the active linking tools described above, but the majoradvantage is that they only neet to be updated at one point on the networkfor them to be correct for all users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
