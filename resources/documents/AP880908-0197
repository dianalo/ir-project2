KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislation imposing sanctions against Iraqfor its purported use of poison gas against Kurdish inhabitants wasintroduced on Thursday by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who told theSenate ``A crime of unthinkable proportions is emerging.''   ``For the second time in this century a brutal dictatorship isusing deadly gas to exterminate a distinct ethnic minority,'' saidPell, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``There can be no doubt but that the Iraqi regime of SaddamHussein intends this campaign to be a final solution to the Kurdishproblem,'' Pell said. ``While a people are gassed, the world islargely silent.''   The Iraqi embassy in Washington has denied that poison gas wasused against the Kurds, asserting that such charges have beenspread by Kurdish leaders living in Europe.   The Pell resolution declares that the Iraqi actions against theKurds ``appears to constitute an act of genocide, a crime abhorredby civilized people everywhere and banned under international law.''   The resolution would ban all U.S. aid to Iraq, ban sales of U.S.military equipment and ban the provision of credit or creditguarantees. It would prohibit the transfer of sensitive technologyto Iraq and bar the import of Iraqi petroleum products into theUnited States.   It also would instruct the U.S. representative to the UnitedNations to vote against all loans to Iraq.   Pell noted that the Iraqi army moved against the Kurds after theAug. 20 ceasefire in Iraq's war with Iran with the objective ofending Kurdish control over a large section of northeast Iraq.   ``The offensive was accompanied by the dynamiting of Kurdishvillages throughout the region,'' Pell said. ``Poisonous gas wasused on the people.''   ``It is said we do not have much influence over Iraq,'' Pellsaid. ``This may be true, but I believe we must use whatever meansat our disposal to get their attention.   ``The Iraqi regime is a vicious dictatorship toughened by yearsof conflict,'' he said. ``Hand wringing alone will not change theircourse; immediate action is essential.''</TEXT></DOC>
