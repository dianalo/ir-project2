The UAW's Ford council, opening a three-day meeting here yesterday, passed resolutions on job security and changes in factory life that take a much harder line than similar resolutions passed in the General Motors council meetings in Detroit last week.    The differences, which aren't entirely unprecedented, may simply be contrasts in rhetoric, which could be smoothed out before negotiations begin. But if they indicate substantive disagreements in approach, they could have significant implications for the negotiations.    The councils include leaders from every local union affiliated with the auto makers. Those meetings generally set the tone for the talks, scheduled to start in late July, and the top union bargainers will now meet to draft specific demands.    The differences could stem from the contrasting financial and market positions of the companies, and could set the stage for a weakening of the decades-old &quot;pattern bargaining&quot; that the union prefers. Ford has peformed much better than GM over the past year, and could probably afford to make stronger job security guarantees. Ford has also slimmed down more than GM, and probably plans fewer job reductions.    The differences so far in the union's stance toward GM and Ford may also come from the contrasting styles of the UAW leaders assigned to deal with the companies. Donald F. Ephlin, the UAW vice president for the GM Department, has shunned militant rhetoric and has encouraged changes in traditional union-managment relations that allow for more joint activities. Stephen P. Yokich, the UAW's Ford vice president, is considered a more traditional trade unionist.    Though the union negotiates with each company separately, it usually has tried to secure contracts that are as similar as possible. Negotiations with GM are scheduled to start July 27 and the Ford talks are expected to begin shortly after. The contracts at both companies expire Sept. 14.    Specifically, the roughly 200 Ford delegates endorsed proposals that said &quot;there will be no outsourcing of work.&quot; Later this week, the group will vote on a resolution demanding that &quot;the level of employment at each location must be maintained at a level equal to the highest level of employment&quot; during the current three-year contract.    In contrast, the 300 GM delegates last week endorsed a proposal asking only &quot;additional safeguards&quot; against outsourcing -- the transfer of work to another company, usually a nonunion company. On the broader question of job security, the GM delegates endorsed a more vague proposal that said the union &quot;must protect the jobs of those 370,000 UAW-GM members currently at work and must seek guarantees that in the years to come the same, or a greater number of jobs will be available for the next generation of workers.&quot;    Another difference in tone has emerged over changes in plant work rules. The Ford delegates backed a resolution that would discourage the elimination or combination of job classifications. The UAW's GM leadership has resisted making any policy statement opposing such modifications, despite complaints from some members that they remove important protections and pit local unions against each other.    Work-rule changes have been far more common in GM plants than in Ford plants in the past year, and have often received the blessing of the UAW's leadership.    The UAW has traditionally picked one company, usually within two weeks of the contract's expiration, as the focus of the talks -- and as a potential strike target. The union would try to reach an agreement at the target company first, then turn to the other company and seek a similar pact. Chrysler Corp. moved out of the traditional negotiation schedule in the early 1980s; its current contract expires in 1988.    If the union decides to preserve the &quot;pattern bargaining&quot; tradition with Ford and GM, its choice of target could indicate how hard a line it will pursue. The selection of Ford might mean it is seeking to press tougher terms.    On the other hand, the union could abandon the pattern tradition, and pursue contracts more specifically tailored to the conditions of the two companies. </TEXT></DOC>
