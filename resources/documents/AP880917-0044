(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leapfrogging questions over the morality ofabortion, an advisory panel has concluded that federal researchersshould be allowed to use fetal tissue in their quest for effectivetreatment for Parkinson's and other diseases.   The leaders of a National Institutes of Health special panelconvened to consider the topic complimented their colleagues Fridayfor focusing on questions put to them by top officials of theDepartment of Health and Human Services.   Left unresolved was whether a proposed White House ban on usingthe remains of fetuses intentionally and legally aborted in suchexperimental treatments will be upheld during the waning months ofthe Reagan administration.   Also unanswered was whether President Reagan is throwing hispersonal political weight behind the proposal, which was circulatedfor private review by administration health officials.   The NIH panel voted late Friday _ 19-0, with two abstentions _to ``recommend that research proceed.''   Retired federal appellate Judge Arlin M. Adams of Philadelphia,the special committee's chairman, indicated at a news conferencethat he and some other panel members personally were opposed toabortion but did not let that enter into their decision torecommend that the government not stand in the way of using legallyobtained fetal remains for research.   Defending the panel against allegations from anti-abortioniststhat the makeup of the panel was stacked in favor of allowing theresearch, Adams told reporters that an examination of his opinionsas a judge would show that he was ``very concerned about abortion''himself.   ``I didn't know how I was going to vote until I had heard thetestimony,'' said Adams, who was one of the 19.   Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, head of the department of obstetrics andgynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, acknowledgedthat the fundamental question of the morality of abortion was afactor.   ``It seemed to me that the abortion question was in thebackground, hovering over us all the time,'' said Ryan, chairman ofthe scientific issues portion of the committee deliberations. ``ButI thought the panelists were so intellectually honest withthemselves that they made every effort to divorce the abortionquestion ... wherever possible from the question of whether youcould use the product of abortion.   ``I think that was really the key of the entire three-daydiscussion: Could you divorce the two. Some people think you cannot.   ``I suspect that most of the people on the panel believedhonestly ... that you could, with necessary safeguards, make acleavage between the two questions.''   Sensitive to those concerns, the committee extensively discussedwhat type of safeguards should be recommended. Indeed, thediscussion ran so long, the panel will meet again before completingits work and forwarding its formal, written recommendations to astanding NIH advisory committee by Dec. 1.   It did agree that ``a pregnant woman should not be induced toterminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue fortransplantation or medical research.''   It said the mother's decision to have an abortion should be keptseparate from her decision to allow the fetus to be used forresearch and that guidelines must be drawn to avoidcommercialization of fetal tissue.   As part of those fundamental safeguards, it said anonymityshould be maintained between the donor and recipient so there wouldnot be a temptation for a woman to have what was referred to indiscussions as a ``custom pregnancy'' and abortion in an effort toprovide tissue that might be implanted in a relative withParkinson's or some other disease.   The committee members responded cautiously to reports that WhiteHouse adviser Gary Bauer, a staunch opponent of abortion anddistributor of the draft executive order that would ban fetaltissue research, has suggested that Reagan might make a decisionthat runs counter to the committee's recommendations, perhaps evenbefore they are finalized.   ``Because it's an election year, I think it's very difficult tocomment on why people do what they do,'' said Ryan.   Nonetheless, he said, it would ``fly in the face of theusefulness'' of appointing the committee in the first place if adecision was to be made before it made its recommendations.</TEXT></DOC>
