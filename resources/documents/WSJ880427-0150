The system of federalism stipulated by the Founders has been replaced by what is, in essence, a unitary system of government.    The 10th Amendment provided that all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are &quot;reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot; But not only did the high court rule in South Carolina v. Baker that state and local bonds can be taxed the next time a revenue-hungry Congress wills it, it essentially said that the 10th Amendment offers no shield against congressional infringement upon the states. Writing for the majority, Justice William Brennan said that &quot;states must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process.&quot; In other words, the court has effectively washed its hands of its constitutional responsibility to define the separate powers of the state and federal governments. The states better hire the best Washington lobbyists, since as far as the court is concerned they are now on a par with every other special-interest group, from foreign governments to mustard makers.    State and local officials are furious at the decision. Alan Beals of the National League of Cities calls it &quot;tantamount to a decree of unconstitutional surrender imposed on state and local governments.&quot; However, the court's decision had been signaled in a 1985 case involving state enforcement of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. There the court ruled that since Members of Congress are elected by the states, state powers are protected through the political process. This, of course, ignores the fact that once elected Members are clearly part of the federal government. Ask any weary city council that has to meet federal standards for the stepladders it purchases.    There are no pending proposals to tax the $700 billion-plus tax-exempt bond market, but state and local officials know that the day congressional vultures start to circle cannot be far off. In a stinging dissent, Justice O'Connor noted the decision &quot;may strike at the heart of state and local government activities. . . . I do not think that the court has lived up to its constitutional role in this case.&quot;    New Hampshire Governor John Sununu and Robert Hawkins, chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, both think a constitutional amendment clearly limiting the powers of the federal government is needed. &quot;We have to instruct the court it is supposed to be an impartial umpire of the federal system,&quot; Mr. Hawkins says. &quot;Now it is a cheerleader for national power every time Congress scores against the states on a foul play.&quot;    As tempting as such a constitutional amendment might be, it will be a long time coming. The best chance to breathe life back into the 10th Amendment hinges on the appointment of new members to the court. Though seven justices agreed on the narrow issue that South Carolina must issue its bonds in registered form, Justices Scalia and Rehnquist said the majority opinion went too far in limiting states' rights.    Under federalism, states and cities are forced to compete with each other in the public-policy arena; the worst policies are discredited by the flight of people or capital. The Brennan decision represents a transfer of power away from such laboratories to Congress. The eventual reversal of this decision will help restore a proper balance of powers. </TEXT></DOC>
