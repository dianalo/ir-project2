As much at issue in the March 8 Democratic and Republicanprimary campaigns as the nominations for five seats on thenine-member court is the reputation of the high court itself.   Texas is the last big state to elect its appeals justices.   In unusually high-profile developments over the last year, thetroubled Supreme Court has seen two justices publicly reprimanded,two others depart because of disagreement over whether justicesshould be elected or appointed, and Republicans bidding to achievetheir first majority on the court.   ``It is, I think, without question the most important judicialelection in Texas ever, certainly the most important judicialelection in over 100 years,'' said Thomas Phillips, the onlyRepublican chief justice this century.   Phillips was appointed to the court by GOP Gov. Bill Clements,who said the judge ``represents the first volley in the fight for ajudicial selection in Texas in which merit and fairness are thedetermining factors in the selection of Supreme Court justices.''   Phillips, a Houston district judge, succeeded Democrat JohnHill, who resigned to return to private practice and champion thecause of an appointed appellate judiciary. Hill charges that theelection process leads to big donations from lawyers who have casesbefore the court.   CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the court late lastyear titled, ``Is Texas Justice For Sale?''   Hill's resignation was followed by that of Justice RobertCampbell, who argued that appointing judges is ``a mere scheme togive big business interests the power to control our courts.''   Clements again appointed a Republican, Judge Barbara Culver ofMidland, to replace Campbell, giving the GOP two Supreme Courtjustices for the first time this century.   Neither Phillips nor Ms. Culver has an opponent in theRepublican primary and they are expected to lead the so-called GOPcourt reform slate, which hopes to capitalize on negative publicityto defeat Democrats in November.   Justice William Kilgarlin, for example, was publicly admonishedby the State Commission on Judicial Conduct last June. Thecommission's report listed Kilgarlin's failure to require staffmembers to observe proper ethical standards and the solicitation offunds.   Kilgarlin dismissed the criticism as insignificant andimmediately announced for re-election.   Only recently, campaign reports showed that Kilgarlin andJustice Ted Robertson had received $25,000 apiece in January fromJoe Jamail, the lead attorney for Pennzoil Co. in its lawsuitagainst Texaco Inc., two months after the Supreme Court upheld amultibillion-dollar verdict favoring Pennzoil.   Jamail and his family have contributed $288,000 to sittingSupreme Court justices since 1980.   Kilgarlin's opponent in the Democratic primary is State DistrictJudge Carol Haberman, a former San Antonio city council member.   Republicans seeking that seat are Justice Nathan Hecht of the5th Court of Appeals in Dallas, D. Camille Dunn of the 1st Court ofAppeals in Houston, and Ronald Block, a Houston attorney who livesin Missouri City.   Dallas lawyer John Humphreys opposes Robertson in the Democraticprimary for chief justice.   The Democrats avoided a possible party-splitting campaignbetween former U.S. Rep. Jack Hightower and former state Sen. LloydDoggett when Hightower switched to a race with no Democraticopponent. He will face Ms. Culver in November.   Doggett is opposed by State District Judge Marsha Anthony ofHouston, who became known statewide three years ago when shedeclared the state's no pass, no play rule unconstitutional. Thatruling was reversed by the state Supreme Court.   Republicans George Barbary, a Dallas attorney, and Justice PaulMurphy of the 14th Court of Appeals in Houston oppose each other inthe race for that seat on the court.   The late entry of San Antonio lawyer Art Vega spoiled JusticeRaul Gonzalez's previously uncontested bid for the Democratic Partynomination. Gonzalez is the first Hispanic elected to statewideoffice in Texas.   Justice Charles Ben Howell, also of the 5th Court of Appeals inDallas, is unopposed in the GOP primary for that seat. Howell losta Supreme Court race in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
