(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Twenty-six teen-agers moved into theSouth African consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protestto mark the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.   The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office,singing songs such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and other protestanthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering.   The group brought sleeping bags, food and satchels of books. Theysaid they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when fellowprotesters planned a march at the building to commemorate thebirthday of the slain American civil rights leader and to denounceSouth Africa's system of racial segregation.   ``We're doing it for the kids of South Africa, where they can bedetained and tortured even without their parents' knowing it,'' saidSusan Goldberg, 14, a student at 32nd Street School.   ``We want to disrupt their business because they make money hereand that's more money for the racist South African government,''said Sonia Slutsky, 16, a junior at Beverly Hills High School.   More than 20 uniformed police officers stood by, along withplainclothes officers and fire inspectors, who warned the studentsagainst blocking exits.   Consular officials were unavailable to both protesters and thenews media, but police Lt. Robert Curtis said officers would removethe students if South African officials or building managers made atrespassing complaint.   One consulate patron, an American citizen from South Africa whosaid he was seeking a visa to visit his family, was turned away whenthe group refused to move away from the door.   The students said they took the day off from school with theirparents' permission.   The group was drawn from 50 area high schools and junior highschools and trained in civil disobedience by activists at theUniversity of California, Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
