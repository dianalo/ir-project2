But Japan's giant electronics companieshaven't been top stock-market performers in recent years, andthey won't get any help this week when the companies reportearnings for the year-ended March 31.   Profits are weakening, and so are the shares of Japan'stechnology behemoths. Many of them -- including Sony,Hitachi, NEC, Matsushita Electric Industrial and PioneerElectronic -- are traded in the U.S. as American DepositaryReceipts.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's time for us to take some rest,&quot; says Sony's DeputyPresident Ken Iwaki. &quot;It has been an exceptional three years,and we don't have the resources to continue that growth.&quot;   Adds Tsutomu Kanai, who will take over as Hitachi Ltd.president next month: &quot;Until last year, the trend was forincreased revenue and increased profits. This time, profitswon't grow as much.&quot;   In other words, for a while at least, investors can'tcount on Japan's world dominance in basic memory chips andconsumer electronics to fuel the double-digit profit jumpsthat have allowed Japan's techno-giants to expand rapidly andto buy up major foreign companies such as U.S. movie studios.   Pioneer stock is down 16% since Nihon Keizai Shimbun, afinancial newspaper, reported May 11 that the company wouldpost a 21% earnings decline for the current fiscal year,ending March 1992. In sympathy, Sony and the Panasonicbrand's marketer, Matsushita Electric Industrial, both wereoff 4% last week. (Pioneer, which reports results May 23,won't confirm or deny the Nikkei report.)   The industry earnings weakness results mainly from broadeconomic factors outside its control: a recession ofuncertain length in the U.S., a slowdown in consumer spendingin Japan, exchange rates that weaken Japanese exports, andhigh interest rates that boost the cost of investing. Similarfactors have trapped the Japanese stock market in a tradingrange for much of this year.   The Nikkei average of 225 stocks closed Friday at25,701.94 yen, up nearly 30% from its October low, but off2.2% for the week. The major computer and semiconductormakers such as NEC and Hitachi have zigzagged downward forthe past two to three months.   For some of the Japanese electronics companies, the profitslowdown actually hit last year, while others face it thisyear. The Nihon Keizai article on Pioneer said the company'soperating profits rose 9% in the year that ended March 31,but will tumble this year because of sluggish demand foraudio equipment and car electronics, plus higher interestpayments -- factors that would affect all Japanese consumerelectronics companies. Though less drastically affected, Sonyis expected to see a similar pattern: 40% operating-profitgrowth last year but single-digit growth this year. Analystssay Matsushita will report flat profit for last year, andthey forecast a slight increase for the year ahead.   Other stocks -- such as Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba -- aremore susceptible to the sharp movements in semiconductorpricing. The erosion last year in basic-memory-chip pricesdragged down profits for the year through March 31. Toshibacould report operating profit dropped more than 25% lastyear, and may not project any recovery this year. Hitachimight show flat profit for last year, and little growth thisyear either. NEC is expected to register slight growth forlast year and better earnings for this year. Chip prices noware picking up, but long-term trends depend on the economy.   In the late 1980s, Japanese investors were lukewarm toelectronics, preferring the wild gains from companies owningreal estate. Only 15% of Japanese mutual fund assets arecurrently invested in electronics stocks, down from 45% in1984, according to Akira Suzuki, a strategist at MorganStanley Group.   Mr. Suzuki says that, using some measures, a lot ofelectronics stocks are undervalued. While Japan'sconventional price-earnings ratios still are much higher thanin the U.S. -- at least double and often triple U.S. levels-- he says that the price-to-cash flow ratio for companieslike Hitachi and Toshiba is now below that of comparable U.S.companies.   Morgan Stanley last week added Hitachi to its list of&quot;fresh money buys,&quot; arguing that for now, &quot;technology andcapital goods rather than basic industries will be primaryengines of performance.&quot; Analysts note that whilemacroeconomic concerns bode tough times for stock prices inthe near term, the trouble is mainly cyclical, and thus willeventually end. Some companies are trimming expenses andcapital spending, but research funding continues at fullpace. Indeed, some analysts contend many of the stocks areundervalued.   &quot;There's certainly room for longer-term acquisitions&quot; ofthe shares by investors; &quot;the major companies, Hitachi inparticular, look attractive over the next 18 months,&quot; saysSteve Myers, Jardine Fleming Securities' Tokyo technologyanalyst. But he adds: &quot;There's not much I'd buy for threemonths. It doesn't make sense to buy these until they're dirtcheap on the charts -- and they're not there yet.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
