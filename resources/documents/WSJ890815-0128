Botha relinquished power last night in the same defiant manner that he has wielded it over the past 11 years. And in so doing he has knocked the ruling National Party on the defensive just three weeks before a tough parliamentary election.    Mr. Botha, who suffered a stroke in January and was expected to resign shortly after the Sept. 6 election, abruptly quit after being abandoned by his cabinet in a bizarre and unseemly power struggle with F.W. de Klerk, his 53-year-old heir apparent and the National Party leader. In a televised announcement, Mr. Botha, 73, a leading figure in the party for the past half century, scolded and belittled his former colleagues, who, he said, suggested he should use his health as a reason for leaving office.    &quot;I am not prepared to leave on a lie,&quot; Mr. Botha said. &quot;It is evident to me that after all my years of endeavors for the National Party and the government of this country and the security of South Africa that I am now being ignored by ministers serving in my cabinet.&quot;    The leadership struggle erupted over the weekend when Mr. de Klerk and foreign minister Pik Botha said they had arranged a meeting with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda for Aug. 28. President Botha said that he hadn't been properly informed of the meeting and that he opposed it. In his speech, he said that Mr. Kaunda provides aid and protection to the Zambia-based African National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the South African government, and that Mr. Kaunda is a leading advocate of international economic sanctions against South Africa. He said Mr. Kaunda would use the meeting to promote negotiations between the National Party and the ANC, banned in South Africa since 1960.    &quot;I am of the opinion that it is inopportune to meet with Kenneth Kaunda at this time,&quot; Mr. Botha said.    Mr. Botha's remarks are sure to become campaign fodder for the National Party's two opponents, especially the right-wing Conservative Party, which opposes any contact with the ANC and any concessions to the country's black majority. The liberal Democratic Party will certainly jump on Mr. de Klerk's feud with Mr. Botha as evidence that the National Party is no longer fit to rule after controlling the government for 41 years.    Mr. de Klerk is due to be sworn in today as acting president, and then he will have his hands full trying to make sure he holds on to the position. Even before the power struggle erupted, political analysts were speculating that growing support for the two opposition parties had an outside chance of depriving the National Party of a parliamentary majority. In the case of a hung Parliament, Mr. de Klerk would be forced to form a coalition with the left or the right.    He tried to take the sting out of Mr. Botha's bitter resignation announcement by saying that it was a &quot;sad day&quot; and expressing &quot;appreciation&quot; for the president's service to South Africa. Still, he is hoping that his leadership qualities have been enhanced by standing up to Mr. Botha, whose style had become increasingly imperious and unpredictable since the stroke. In a televised interview, Mr. de Klerk said that Mr. Botha's &quot;memory is sometimes at fault,&quot; and added that his resignation &quot;is in the best interest of South Africa.&quot;    Mr. de Klerk also argued that he wasn't changing the National Party's position on the ANC, reiterating that the ANC can't join negotiations over the country's future until it abandons violence and pledges to work toward peace.    Pik Botha, the foreign minister, said the meeting with Mr. Kaunda would take place as planned, and he described it as another important step in the National Party's push to end South Africa's isolation. In the past several months, Mr. de Klerk has met with several European leaders, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He has also met with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, and is hoping that the talks with Mr. Kaunda will lead to a summit with other southern African nations. </TEXT></DOC>
