PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Rudy Perpich is expected to call the Minnesota Legislature into special session today or tomorrow to consider a bill designed to protect Dayton Hudson Corp.    Dayton Hudson last week proposed the legislation to toughen the state's anti-takeover law. The Minneapolis-based retailer has spurned an acquisition proposal from Landover, Md.-based Dart Group Corp., a discount retailer that is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, D.C. Dayton Hudson has said its push for the legislation is its main defense against any bid by Dart.    After two days of hearings, legislators continued working late yesterday evening to iron out differences between Senate and House versions of the bill being prepared in anticipation of a special session.    Legislative leaders said there aren't any big differences between the Senate and House versions. &quot;We are confident that we are going to be able to work something out,&quot; said Robert Vanasek, House Speaker-designate.    A spokesman for Gov. Perpich said the governor will call a special session when the House and Senate reach agreement on proposals. Among other things, the legislation would prevent a hostile suitor from selling the assets of an acquired company to finance acquisition costs. It also would make the acquisition of more than a 20% stake in a publicly traded Minnesota company subject to approval by a majority of disinterested shareholders.    Legislators also were debating whether to ban so-called greenmail, a company's buying back stock from an unwanted suitor at higher-than-market prices, and golden parachutes, such as severance payments to executives in the event of a change in ownership. </TEXT></DOC>
