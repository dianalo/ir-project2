I do a lot of preprintempsprimping. I dibble the fall away. Still, this past year Itroweled uneasy on the bulb front.   It's not just the pang I feel each time I slash throughthe heart of a quondam bulb. It's the guilt of certainty thatmy mail-order Minors -- the hardy cyclamens, winter aconites,snowdrops, leucojums, anemones, hoop-petticoat narcissus,etc. -- are not indeed good Dutch burgher bulbs (&quot;Product ofHolland&quot; labels misled me) but are bulb endemics plunderedfrom the wild gene ponds of the Levant.</LP><TEXT>   What bulbwised me up was the historicbulb-origins-labeling agreement signed in May between theDutch bulb industry and the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, the World Wildlife Fund (TRAFFIC-U.S.A.) and theFauna and Flora Preservation Society (U.K.). Thirty-one MinorBulbs, customarily wild-dug, packaged and passed off asDutch, would henceforth exit the Netherlands with the usual&quot;Product of Holland&quot; mislabel, but also verily tagged &quot;BulbsFrom Wild Source.&quot; In 1992, such of the 31 Minors as are bythen propagated will carry &quot;Bulbs Grown From CultivatedStock&quot; birth certificates; so will the Majors, come 1995.   Hard upon the debut of bulb-etiology-by-label, in July,came Smith andamp; Hawken's &quot;Bulb Book.&quot; The catalog commenced witha righteous sermon on the bulb millions &quot;dug from the wild .. . disguised as cultivated or propagated plants {and}shipped to consumers.&quot;   &quot;Much plant extinction,&quot; the catalog continued, &quot;is thedirect consequence of commercial collecting to satisfy worldmarkets for bulbs . . . In the past, companies (ourselvesincluded) have suavely assured customers that `our' bulbswere . . . not wild-collected.&quot; In the present, suavelywiser, Sandamp;H names 13 bulb binomials &quot;of questionable source,&quot;which it has dropped. &quot;We offer only cultivated . . . bulbs&quot;and &quot;have chosen not to offer certain varieties . . . untilthere is reliable certification . . . authenticating thebulbs as commercially propagated.&quot;   Ethical gardening has arrived, and none too soon. I saythis by the guilt of hindsight, recollecting my own entryinto the world of the Bulb Minors in the early '80s viaLouise Beebe Wilder (&quot;Adventures With Hardy Bulbs,&quot; 1936),Elizabeth Lawrence (&quot;The Little Bulbs,&quot; 1957) and E.A. Bowles(&quot;I have an insatiable desire for cyclamen.&quot;) In 1984, anobscure New England catalog that had, the year before, slakedmy own insatiable desire for cyclamen (&quot;rare and gloriouslittle charmers&quot;), mentioned that, &quot;due to the problems inthe Middle East, no white or red botanical cyclamen of anykind were available.&quot; Same for Star of Bethlehem andSternbergia clusiana: &quot;Not available this year. Middle EastSituation.&quot;   That the Mideast had to do with my private bulb life wasnews. I phoned the Yankee nurseryman for an ME situationer.&quot;These wild cyclamen are collected all through the mountainsalong the Eastern Mediterranean -- in Turkey, Syria,Lebanon,&quot; he obliged. &quot;The collectors stake them out whenthey're in bloom, then go back and bring them out oncamelback and in caravans. Very romantic. But right now thecollectors are scared stiff to go into Lebanon. And we'rehaving problems with the Turkish government.&quot; He hoped &quot;theIsraelis will get into cyclamen. Israel is beginning to growthe Star of Bethlehem. Though,&quot; he sighed, &quot;they've got theirproblems.&quot;   My Middle East gardening problems became acute in 1985,upon reading &quot;The Laundered Bulb Trade Is a Dirty Business&quot;in the New York Botanical Garden's Garden magazine. SaraOldfield of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre'sWildlife Monitoring Unit (U.K.) wrote: &quot;Every year, millionsof flower bulbs are dug up from the natural bulb fields ofMediterranean Europe, the Mideast and Central Asia to . . .satisfy the horticultural demand.&quot; She identified Turkey,&quot;extraordinarily rich in bulb species&quot; as &quot;the largestexporter of wild bulbs.&quot; Very unromantically she described&quot;truckloads of Turkish bulbs . . . regularly delivered to theNetherlands for sale . . . to the international market,&quot; andwarned, &quot;long-time garden favorites are becoming . . .extinct in the wild,&quot; as &quot;illegally wild-dug&quot; bulbs, in vastnumbers, &quot;end up in American gardens.&quot;   The international bulb-rustling cartel's ultimate consumeris, of course, Everygardener. &quot;Bulb buying and growing is amajor aspect of gardening -- everybody is a bulb gardener,&quot;Ms. Oldfield said, though &quot;until now, authorities andgardeners alike have been unaware of the magnitude of theillicit traffic in bulbs.&quot;   Everygardener-USA was interring a gigabulb a year, and Iwas Everygardener, party to illicit bulb practices. Abashed,I began asking my suppliers if my own delightful misc. Minorswere illegit. To a bulbsman, they straightened their facesand said: &quot;These are DUTCH bulbs]&quot;   Something on the order of 100 million bulb wildlings movethrough the trade each year. Since World War II the industryhas exploited Turkey, preeminently, as a vast free-dig,open-pit, bulb mine: 71 million anemones, 20 millioncyclamen, 62 million leucojums, 111 million winter aconites,200 million snowdrops were extracted from Turkey in the '80s,without any documentable attempt to leave behind a viablebulb population for future harvest. (Anent the Middle EastSituation 1991, would the talked-of Turkish second front inthe Bush War for a time interdict Turkey's bulb-miningoperations?)   Among New World bulb activists, the &quot;eminence grise&quot; isMarjorie Arundel of the Garden Club of America, a gardenerpossessed of a Narcissus poeticus writing style. &quot;Theancestors of our modern tulips and narcissi are classiclittle forms among the rich floral treasure evolved throughthe millenia,&quot; she wrote in 1986. Yet, &quot;the world's lovedbulbous-rooted flora may be facing extinction.&quot; Her cri decorm: &quot;It is unthinkable for gardeners to knowingly add tothe destruction of these little patriarchs, the floral generesources of the planet.&quot; Doffing her white goat gloves inthe August 1989 GCA Bulletin she declared: &quot;You can, quitesimply, screen out all wild bulbs offered and become aneffective defense attorney at once for the little wild,patriarch bulbs without whose genes there would be no tulips,no daffodils and no catalogues. No one will want to be caughtwielding a `smoking trowel' . . . DO NOT WIELD THE SMOKINGTROWEL]]]&quot;   The GCA advocates substitution of nano-bulb hybrids. (&quot;Canbe planted in good conscience,&quot; NRDC.) Shocked &quot;to see thisworld heritage in Mediterranean genetic resources up forsale,&quot; Mrs. Arundel and cohorts have suggested bulb-ranchingin the Minors' homelands. (A Peace Corps project?)   Several catalogs (Smith andamp; Hawken, Burpee, Van Tubergen)have cut bulbs of dubious origin, but the NYBG seems stuck onold-style, oblivious bulbopoly. Despite the years ofwild-bulb consciousness-raising in Garden magazine, the NYBGShops again sold wild bulbs this season -- some even labeled&quot;Bulbs From Wild Source.&quot;   In 1987, when the NYBG sent members a brochure, &quot;Bulbs forPermanent Effects: A professional selection by the New YorkBotanical Garden,&quot; offering &quot;many rare bulbs that are notgenerally available elsewhere,&quot; an in-Garden wild-bulbimbroglio ensued. Staffers were outraged that this majorenvironmental education institution was hawking wild-dugbulbs -- nine species of the 31 now on the Index of ForbiddenBulbs. This practice has ended, and the NYBG Shops' wild-bulbbrokering ought to, as well. Everygardener hopes the NYBGwill begin reading bulb-origins labels, since its PR man,Karl Lauby, stated yesterday, &quot;We do not sell bulbs collectedfrom the wild knowingly.&quot;   For righteous gardeners who knowingly choose to become probono bulb DAs, Made-in-U.S.A.
