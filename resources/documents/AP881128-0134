The new figure is the highest monthly inflation rate since the1950s and likely will continue rising through December, the officialState Statistical Bureau said.   In September, government leaders began an austerity drivedesigned to curb inflation below 10 percent.   However, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted the bureau assaying panic buying in August and September has ``almost ended'' andbank savings, which went down sharply, was returning to normal.   Authorities have imposed rationing after reports of panic buyingof textiles in Shanghai and salt in 19 other areas.   The inflation statistics came as the State Commission forRestructuring the Economy, which has charted economic reforms, andthe State Planning Commission, in charge of economic planning, meton Monday.   A television news broadcast said Premier Li Peng and Vice PremierYao Yilin, who head the commissions respectively, reported progresswas being made but more work was needed to reign in the overheatedeconomy.   The report did not say if the commissions were considering newmeasures to reduce inflation.   State Statistical Bureau spokesman Mao Youfeng told Xinhua thatChina's retail price index in October was 26.1 percent higher thanin October 1987. The last time China released comparable figures, itsaid June prices were up 19 percent over June 1987.   Mao said prices in October were up 17 percent from Jan. 1 and theannual inflation rate is believed to be about 40 percent.   The official China News Service has said that September retailprices in the southern commercial city of Canton were up 44 percentfrom a year earlier, and inflation in other cities also was abovethe national average.   China has not experienced such high inflation since the initialyears after World War II and the 1949 communist takeover. Althoughinflationary pressures existed, the government kept pricesartificially low and subsidized farmers and factories.   In recent years, the government has raised some prices anddecontrolled others in an effort to develop a market-style economy.Prices have been pushed up by growing industrial demand for limitedraw materials, fuel and transport services, as well as by highconsumer demand for household appliances.   In addition, inflation was fueled by widespread hoarding andprofiteering.   In an effort to curb demand, the government in late Septemberordered a halt to thousands of construction projects nationwide andtold government offices to cut spending.   However, industrial output still grew more than 20 percent inOctober over the previous year, indicating the policies have not yetbeen effective.</TEXT></DOC>
