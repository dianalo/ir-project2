Calling NATO's current proposal only a starting point fornegotiations with the Warsaw Pact nations, retired Army Gen. AndrewJ. Goodpaster on Thursday told the Senate Armed Services Committeehis plan amounts to a ``radical restructuring'' on both sides.   The current NATO proposal calls for a 5 percent to 10 percentcut in battle tanks, heavy artillery and armored troop carriers.The offer came in response to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev'sproposal last December to cut the Red Army by 10 percent with areduction of 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troops in Eastern Europe.   ``I do not think the interests of the West would be served ifthat's as far as we went,'' said Goodpaster, who served as supremeAllied commander in Europe from 1968 to 1969.   Goodpaster, 74, said his proposal calls for ``parity, with totalactive forces on each side at no more than 50 percent of presentNATO strength.''   The proposal surprised the members of the Senate Armed Servicespanel with Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., interrupting Goodpaster'stestimony to clarify what the retired general had suggested.   ``Do you think it's a mistake to focus in isolation on thecurrent NATO proposal?'' Nunn asked.   ``I do indeed,'' responded Goodpaster, the onetime aide toformer President Eisenhower who helped him organize NATO's militaryarm in the early 1950s.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on thecommittee, described Goodpaster's proposal as ``history in themaking, a bold initiative.'' Nunn called the plan a ``boldproposal.''   After the hearing, Nunn said Goodpaster's plan, coming from a``stalwart supporter of the alliance,'' would cause a considerablestir.   Goodpaster is telling NATO officials, ``Get your thinking capson,'' Nunn said.   Goodpaster is chairman of The Atlantic Council of the UnitedStates, a NATO support group.   The panel also heard from Phillip A. Karber, a defenseconsultant with a subsidiary of the Ford Aerospace Co., who arguedagainst 50 percent reductions in NATO forces, and Stan Sloan, aformer CIA analyst on NATO affairs who serves as a seniorspecialist in international security.   Sloan told the committee that French officials had expressedconcerns about NATO's proposed cuts and favored unilateralreductions if there had to be any agreement.   Meanwhile, House Armed Services Chairman, Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., said NATO should accept the Warsaw Pact's offer and stoprefusing to include aircraft in the first round of negotiations.   ``We should take a leaf from Mikhail Gorbachev's book and acceptour opponent's first offer,'' Aspin told an audience in the Hague,Netherlands. ``It would do us more good militarily and politicallythan if we prevailed with NATO's go-slow position.''   Aspin has criticized NATO's position since negotiations beganlast month in Vienna between Moscow and the Warsaw Pact nations andNATO.</TEXT></DOC>
