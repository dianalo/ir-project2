Jefferson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/20/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><IN>TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)</IN><LP>   LOS ANGELES -- &quot;Rationality&quot; is finally returning to thehigh-stakes leveraged buy-out market, says Timothy M.Pennington III, co-founder of Brentwood Associates.   After going nearly two years without a buy-outtransaction, the LBO and venture capital firm this weekcompleted a $143 million management-led buy-out of MobileTechnology Inc., a closely held provider of diagnosticimaging equipment to the health-care industry.</LP><TEXT>   The completion of the deal represents the flip-side to thewoeful tales coming from the big New York buy-out firms. Inmany ways, the recent failures of some big junk-bond financedbuy-outs have helped end the drought for Brentwood.   Like many smaller firms, Brentwood found itself priced outof the market in the past few years, as easy access tojunk-bond financing allowed companies to command ever higherpurchase prices. &quot;Whereas a transaction might have been goodat five to seven times a company's earnings before incometaxes, we were seeing a lot going for eight-to-10 times, evenone at 14 times,&quot; Mr. Pennington says.   Ironically, when the bidding for Mobile Technology beganlast year, the company was too pricey for Brentwood's taste.&quot;The auction process started with the auctioneer saying,`Here's the hurdle.' We said we wouldn't jump over it. So wedidn't attend the auction,&quot; Mr. Pennington recalls. &quot;Therewas a period of time where the company thought they'd goelsewhere at the higher price. Ultimately, {MobileTechnology} came back to us.&quot;   In addition to the lower pricing that has come with thecollapse of the junk-bond market, the deals getting donethese days will include more equity and less leverage, Mr.Pennington says. &quot;The equity requirement had gone down tojust 10% to 12%. Now we're moving to a 15% to 20% equityrequirement,&quot; he says.   The Mobile Technology buy-out includes equity of $23million, or 16%, of which $20 million was contributed byBrentwood from a $140 million buy-out fund raised at the endof 1988. The rest of the purchase price includes $60 millionof senior secured debt and $60 million of subordinated debt.   Ronald D. Van Horssen, president and chief executiveofficer of Mobile Technology, said the buy-out will allow thecompany &quot;continued growth,&quot; noting that Brentwood'sphilosophy is &quot;to grow a company rather than sell assets oradopt a no-growth strategy to finance the restructuring.&quot;   Mobile Technology had 1989 revenue of about $76 million.Founded in 1983, the company provides mobile magneticresonance imaging services to about 400 hospitals in 35states. The company has 465 employees.   Brentwood, with more than $470 million in assets, hascompleted buy-outs of Prince Manufacturing Inc., a tennisracket maker, and Educational Publishing Co., among others.Brentwood's most recent buy-out was of Tuboscope Corp. in1988, purchased from Minstar Inc. for about $136 million.Tuboscope was taken public last month.</TEXT></DOC>
