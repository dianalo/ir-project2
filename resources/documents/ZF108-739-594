 described internally as &quot;transition toa market economy,&quot; have not yet convinced U.S.andP;  officials that the Sovietshave practical knowledge of how capitalism works.andM;Consequently, a transition in the U.S.andP;  to less rigorous high-technologyexport regulations has been cautiously sluggish.andM;Many American software vendors contend that the U.S.andP;  government remains asambivalent about cooperating with the Soviets as before the recentdiminishing of the Cold War.andM;&quot;GIVING AWAY&quot; REVENUES?andM;The U.S.andP;  Departments of Defense and Commerce continue to impose restrictionsthat American software vendors claim are exaggerated.andP;  Some industryobservers even declare the U.S.andP;  is in the process of &quot;giving away anotherindustry&quot; to foreign competitors.andM;The U.S.andP;  government recently declared that it will support a &quot;completeoverhaul&quot; of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls(Cocom) technology export restrictions to Eastern Europe and the SovietUnion.andP;  That declaration is said by observers to be in response to growingpressure from Congress, business leaders and Western European allies whothreatened to abandon the 41-year-old Cocom over U.S.andP;  intransigence ontechnology issues.andP;  Cocom's 17-nation organization is charged with overseeingworldwide efforts to keep sensitive technology out of the hands of potentialadversaries, including the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.andM;&quot;In the open market, the U.S.andP;  can only compete in high technology and not inthe low end,&quot; said Yuri Parad, managing director of eastern and centraloperations of Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif.andM;&quot;We are restricted and at this time are only allowed to sell standalone andnot networking software products,&quot; Paras said.andP;  &quot;This is hurting our businessbecause revenues go to other nations, and it's hurting Eastern Europeaneconomies.andP;  I believe it's in our best interest to help develop theireconomies so that they can have democracy.&quot;andM;PAPERWORK CONCERNSandM;Although observers agree that the U.S.andP;  Commerce Department is trying torelax licensing requirements, U.S.andP;  software exporters remain troubled aboutthe amount of paperwork required, vendors said.andM;Corporate legal and technical experts often work together to decipherambiguous government definitions of technical terms.andP;  Some observers feelthat this ambiguity may be a deliberate effort to force firms to regularlyconsult with the Commerce Department.andM;&quot;Depending on who you talk to, you get a different interpretation,&quot; commentedone observer, who asked not to be identified.andP;  Yet , it is essential thatvendors know whether product is declassified because ignorance does notprotect from liability, the observer said.andM;&quot;It's a pain in the neck to apply for an IVL [Individual Validated License],&quot;said Parad.andP;  &quot;Sometimes you get rejected five or six times for merelybureaucratic reasons.&quot;andM;Parad said, however, that despite U.S.andP;  government restrictions, EasternEurope and the U.S.S.R.andP;  offer substantial opportunities for those softwarevendors willing to make long-term investments.andP;  &quot;We are actively working ineach country, educating potential customers and setting up distributors,&quot;said Parad.andM;Oracle's Eastern European customers already include: the Budapest, Hungary,Traffic Company; the Hungarian Electricity Board; the Polish National Bank;and the Czechoslovakian National Bank.andM;The effort to compute the nonconvertible currency of Eastern Europe isunsettling to software vendors.andP;  However, Parad maintains that marketingOracle relational database management system (RDBMS) software there should berelatively easy because the software is already widely used there.andM;According to informed sources, illegal copies of the Oracle RDBMS have beendistributed throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for at least fiveyears.andP;  Since those countries could not legally acquire a copy from Oracle,companies purchased the software via a black market.andM;According to Parad, Eastern-bloc programmers, especially in the Soviet Union,East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia have become very literate inthe Oracle software.andM;CREATIVE PROGRAMMERSandM;&quot;They are used to restrictions,&quot; Parad said.andP;  &quot;They've had to make extensionsand improvements to Russian computers for so long that their training isunique.andP;  Because they've had to make ends meet, their thinking is extremelyflexible.&quot;andM;According to Donald Sundeen, president of Applications Software Inc.,andO;Westminster, Calif., &quot;They have excellent programmers there.andP;  When you havelittle to work with, hardware-wise, it forces you to exhibit a degree ofcreativity in programming.andM;FORMING BAD HABITSandM;&quot;In contrast,&quot; he said, &quot;if you have a lot of hardware to work with, thiscreativity is generally dormant.andP;  The luxury of being able to work with toomuch memory spawns bad programming habits.&quot;andM;Jerome Sorkin, president of Republic Service Bureau, Inc., a data processingservice company headquartered in Torrance, Calif., is a volunteer at a jobbank for Russian programmers.andP;  &quot;I hired a Russian programmer a few monthsago,&quot; said Sorkin.andP;  &quot;He is very good and is familiar with IBM and Cobol.&quot;andM;Alex Dorfman, the Russian programmer/analyst hired by Republic grew up inLeningrad and studied at the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute before enteringthe U.S.andP;  as a Jewish refugee about five months ago.andM;&quot;I am happy to be in America,&quot; said Dorfman in fluent English.andP;  &quot;It isdifficult to find a good job in the Soviet Union.andP;  My job responsibilities atmy last employment in Russia had similar requirements to the ones I have now.andO;I was responsible for systems software maintenance on mainframes and PCs,system software packages and development for data management.&quot;andM;Dorfman said that in the Soviet Union, he used American database software,such as Oracle; dBase III, from Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, Calif.; andClipper, from Nantucket Corp., Los Angeles.andP;  In addition, he said he used IBM370-compatible mainframe computers--which were built in Russia--personalcomputers and the NetWare local-area networking (LAN) system from Novell Inc.andO;of Provo, Utah.andM;&quot;Marketing in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union provides an excellentopportunity for us because people there will bypass the mainframe/mini phaseand go directly from PCs to large local-area network systems,&quot; contendedKanwal Rekhi, executive vice president of product development at Novell.andO;However, Rekhi said that so far, &quot;U.S.andP;  licensing restrictions have turnedour efforts into a painful experience.&quot;andP;  Currently, Novell is only allowed toship a stripped-down version of its LAN system, while Soviet users can buythe full Novell networking system fairly easily on the Southeast Asian blackmarket.andM;Novell is looking to convince the government to modify the restrictions,officials said.andM;&quot;We are working with the government, keeping them current on our products andour technology so they can write reports and use correct terminology,&quot; saidCarey Heckman, senior corporate counsel at Novell.andM;&quot;The government is sincere and hasn't been deaf to export control issues,&quot;Heckman said.andP;  &quot;It's not prejudice that causes a problem.andP;  It's the fact thattechnology is so hard to follow.andP;  It takes an incredible amount of effort toassess technology--what matters and what doesn't.andM;&quot;On one hand, we don't want the Russians to use our technology against us,&quot;Heckmen said.andP;  &quot;On the other, do we want them to trail us so much that theycontrol their missiles with technology from the 1950s?&quot;andM;HOW VENDORS HELP THEIR CAUSEandM;In addition to helping the government decision-making process with technicaladvice and updates, software vendors can complete other tasks to alterlicensing restrictions against its products.andM;For example, observers said, a company can ascertain, whether non-U.S.andP;  firmsalready offer similar products in the Eastern European market.andP;  If a companycan provide proof of foreign availability, it can petition the CommerceDepartment to lift restrictions.andM;U.S.andP;  companies whose products have passed through the export restrictioncriterion process unscathed include Ashton-Tate for its dBase personalcomputer DBMS.andM;Like Oracle, Ashton-Tate has seen the dBase product installed illegally onthousands of personal computers in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.andP;  &quot;Weare trying to find them and sell them licenses,&quot; said Bruce Marquart,Ashton-Tate general manager of Eastern Europe operations.andP;  &quot;That's why we areinvesting in joint ventures and setting up distributors in every country, sothat we can provide good service for our licensed products.&quot;andM;One of Ashton-Tate's Soviet moves was to bundle the Framework II integratedsoftware package with Informontage-2, a language management shell developedby the Leningrad Institute of Informatik and Automation.andP;  The bundling allowsusers to switch between Latin and Cyrillic keyboard configurations.andM;In the West, Marquart considers the United Nations as well as universities tobe a good market for this multifunction, multilanguage package.andP;  &quot;Wemanufacture the boxes and distribution sets in the West,&quot; said Marquart.andO;&quot;For Soviet distribution, the product gets assembled in Leningrad, and forWestern distribution, we assemble it in London.&quot;andM;IMPORTANCE OF DOING HOMEOWRKandM;Ashton-Tate has already taken steps to prevent illegal copying ofInformontage-2.andM;&quot;We protect our software by means of a dongle, which is a hardware encryptiondevice,&quot; said Marquart.andP;  &quot;One needs to invest time in understanding thedifferent cultures and languages of Eastern Europe.andP;  Going there to make aquick deal is not possible.andP;  One needs to do quite a bit of homework first.&quot;andM;John Bowne, president and CEO of Software Products International (SPI), SanDiego, said joint ventures are the best way to market software to the SovietUnion.andP;  SPI, which markets a multifunction package called Open Access, lastyear began a joint venture called Intersoft with the Academy of Sciences inMoscow.andP;  Eventually, Bowne hopes to market Soviet-developed software in theWest.andM;As a former chairman of the Commerce Department's Technical AdvisoryCommittee on Computer Peripherals, Bowne said he is familiar with U.S.andO;export restrictions.andM;&quot;We are the only system that regards business and the government asadversary,&quot; said Bowne.andP;  &quot;All the other Cocom members regard business forwhat it is.andP;  We regard it as foreign policy.andP;  But I think things areloosening up.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
