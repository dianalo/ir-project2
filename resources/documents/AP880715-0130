The sogginess, which optimists call unseasonal, has slightlydampened the tourist trade. But for some parched visitors from theUnited States, it's becoming an attraction.   According to the London Weather Center, southeast England wasdrenched with 1{ times the average amount of rain during the firsttwo weeks of July. Temperatures have been several degrees belownormal, the center says, and there has been only 80 percent of thenormal amount of sunshine.   ``It's pretty bad,'' said a spokesman at the weather office, whorequested anonymity in keeping with civil service rules. ``We'vehad three fairly poor summers in a row. If we keep on going, it'llbe a fourth.''   That prospect worries some in the tourism business.   At the London Zoo, spokeswoman Sue Copsey said attendance is``slightly down'' because of the weather. ``We're obviously hopingthat August will be nice,'' she said.   The sentiment is shared at Guided Tours of London, whichconducts walking tours of the British capital. An employee theresaid because of the weather, ``We're finding that (people are) notturning up.''   But overall, British tourism officials say, the gray skies andtepid temperatures haven't kept foreign visitors away.   ``As far as overseas visitors, the weather doesn't affectnumbers,'' said Bob Barton, an official with the British TouristAuthority. ``Most people coming to Britain expect to get badweather.''   But bad is in the eye of the beholder.   American tourists questioned at random said they found the wet,cool London weather a welcome change from the searing heat in partsof the United States.   ``I came from a 105-degree heat wave and I'm very happy to behere,'' said Joyce Fogg of Fair Lawn, N.J.   Standing in a long line outside a tourist eatery under a skythreatening yet another downpour, Ms. Fogg said she was notdisappointed with London's notoriously bad weather. ``I was toldthat it would be rainy,'' she said.   Her 14-year-old daughter Susan chimed in: ``I love it. It'sgreat to be out of the heat and be in the coolness.''   Judy Tichenor, chaperoning a group of students from Portland,Ore., admitted it would be nice to have had some sunshine. But sheadded: ``It hasn't disappointed us that much. We brought umbrellas.We brought a lot of them.''   To Britons, the occasional sunny day is becoming a novelty.   But Barton, the Tourist Authority official, sees a silver liningin the rain clouds. ``For people from some parts of the world,'' hesaid, ``our weather is a novelty, part of the attraction.''</TEXT></DOC>
