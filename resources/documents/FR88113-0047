Members of NEACare identified in Appendix 3.The five agreements referenced above (collectively, ``the Agreements'')share common characteristics and effect. The Agreements provide, <T3>inter alia, </T3>that (1) members of the Conferences are prohibitedfrom taking independent action (``IA'') for the purpose of entering intoloyalty contracts with shippers; and (2) members of the Conferences areindividually prohibited from entering into such loyalty contracts. TheAgreements differ only in that the GEFA, NEGFA, ANEC and NEAC Agreementspurport to authorize conference loyalty contracts in conformity with theantitrust laws\6\<NOTE/> while the NEUSPFC Agreement is silent on the subject of loyaltycontracts at the conference level.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The GEFA, NEGFA, ANEC and NEAC Agreements utilize operativeagreement language which is identical for all four conferences.The foregoing loyalty contract provisions of the subject Agreements aresubstantially similar in language and effect to that filed by the TranspacificWestbound Rate Agreement (``TWRA'') in Agreement No. 202-010689-027 (``TWRAAgreement''). The Commission recently directed the TWRA and its membersto demonstrate why their restrictions on loyalty contracts should not befound in violation of the Shipping Act of 1984. <T3>See </T3>FMC Docket No. 87-26, <T3>Agreement No. 202-010689-027 Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement_LoyaltyContracts, </T3>Order to Show Cause, served December 3, 1987. For the reasonsset forth below, the Commission has determined that it should also examinein a show cause proceeding the lawfulness and basis for the instant Agreements.As these Agreements share common legal issues with the TWRA Agreement,the Commission has further determined that it will consolidate this docketwith proceedings previously instituted in FMC Docket No. 87-26 for purposesof further hearing and decision.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Commission intends that a uniform procedural schedulegovern all parties to these consolidated dockets. Respondents and intervenorsin Docket No. 87-26 will therefore be afforded additional time to preparetheir initial affidavits and memoranda of law, consistent with the newtimetable for hearing set forth herein.The term ``loyalty contract'' is defined at section 3(14) of the 1984 Act,46 U.S.C. app. section 1702(14), to mean:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * a contract with an ocean common carrier or conference, otherthan a service contract or contract based upon time-volume rates, by whicha shipper obtains lower rates by commiting all or a fixed portion of itscargo to that carrier or conference.</ITAG>It appears that the cited articles of the Agreements violate the Act forthe reasons which follow.Section 5(b) of the 1984 Act,\8\<NOTE/> 46 U.S.C. app. section 1704(b)(8), requires that each conferenceagreement must provide that its members may take independent action ``onany rate or service item required to be filed in a tariff under section8(a).* * *'' As pertinent, section 8(a)(1), 46 U.S.C. app. section 1707(a)(1),requires that tariffs shall:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\As pertinent, section 5 provides:<ITAG tagnum="28">(b) Conference Agreements_Each conference agreement must_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">*   *   *   *   *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(8) provide that any member of the conference may take independentaction on any rate or service item required to be filed in a tariff undersection 8(a) of this Act * * * in lieu of the existing conference tariffprovisions for that rate of service item.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) include sample copies of any loyalty contract, bill of lading,contract of affreightment, or other document evidencing the transportationagreement.</ITAG>Accordingly, it appears that a loyalty contract is a rate or service itemrequired to be included in a tariff within the meaning of section 8(a)of the 1984 Act. Therefore, by prohibiting IA on loyalty contracts, itappears that the Agreements are in violation of section 5(b)(8) of theAct.The sole statutory provision expressly restricting the use of a loyaltycontract by an ocean carrier is section 10(b)(9) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C.app. section 1709(b)(9) which requires that such contract conform to theantitrust laws. However, it appears that neither section 10(b)(9) nor anyother provision of the 1984 Act authorizes a conference to undertake anyaction infringing upon a member's prerogative to enter into loyalty contracts.Section 5(b)(5) of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. section 1704(b)(5), requiresthat each conference agreement must ``prohibit the conference from engagingin conduct prohibited by section 10(c)(1)'' of the Act. Section 10(c)(1),46 U.S.C. app. section 1709(c)(1), provides that no conference or groupof two or more common carriers may:<ITAG tagnum="20">boycott or take any other concerted action resulting in an unreasonablerefusal to deal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Further, section 10(a)(3) of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. section 1709(a)(3)provides that no person may ``operate under an agreement required to befiled * * * except in accordance with the terms of the agreement * * *.''Article 11 of each of the underlying agreements of the respondent Conferencesprovides, <T3>inter alia,</T3> that the conference shall not take concerted actionresulting in an unreasonable refusal to deal. Nonetheless, by collectivelyauthorizing and agreeing to their respective Agreements, which agreementprovisions severally and jointly result in an arbitrary and capriciousrefusal to deal with shippers who might otherwise seek to enter into loyaltycontracts, it appears that the Conferences and their members negated theeffect of and operated contrary to Article 11 and the prohibition requiredby section 5(b)(5). It therefore appears that the Conferences and theirmembers have violated sections 5(b)(5), 10(a)(3), and 10(c)(1) of the Act.In this connection, we vote that the GEFA, NEGFA, ANEC, and NEAC Agreementsdiffer from those of TWRA and NEUSPFC in that the former would authorizeconference loyalty contracts. Our concern is that this is a distinctionwithout a difference, if the authority is not exercised.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\This proceeding is instituted for the purpose of determiningwhether the Agreements are in conformity with the 1984 Act in prohibitingtheir members from entering into loyalty contracts with shippers. Becausethe provisions of particular loyalty contracts are not in issue here, thisproceeding does not seek to inquire into the lawfulness of any such loyaltycontract_e.g., whether a particular loyalty contract may violate section10(b)(10) of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. section 1709(b)(10), which prohibitsa common carrier from demanding, charging or collecting any rate or chargethat is unjustly discriminatory between shippers or ports. Nor does thisproceeding seek to address whether a particular loyalty contract offeredby a carrier or conference violates section 10(b)(9) of the Act, whichprohibits use of a loyalty contract except in conformity with the antitrustlaws.Now therefore, it is ordered That pursuant to section 11 of the ShippingAct of 1984, the North Europe-U.S. Pacific Freight Conference Agreement,Gulf-European Freight Association Agreement, North Europe-U.S. Gulf FreightAssociation Agreement, U.S. Atlantic-North Europe Conference Agreement,and North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conference Agreement and their members showcause why they should not be found to be operating in violation of section5(b)(8) of the Shipping Act of 1984 for not complying with the mandatoryindependent action provision of that section of the 1984 Act and, if foundto be operating in violation, why the Agreements should not be disapproved,canceled, or modified by the Commission;It is further ordered That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of1984, the North Europe-U.S. Pacific Freight Conference Agreement, Gulf-EuropeanFreight Association Agreement, North Europe-U.S. Gulf Freight AssociationAgreement, U.S. Atlantic-North Europe Conference Agreement, and North Europe-U.S.Atlantic Conference Agreement and their members show cause why they shouldnot be found to be in violation of section 5(b)(5) of the Shipping Actof 1984 for not prohibiting concerted action resulting in an unreasonablerefusal to deal and, if found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(5)of the 1984 Act, why the Agreements should not be disappproved, cancelledor modified by the Commission;It is further ordered That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of1984, the North Europe-U.S. Pacific Freight Conference Agreement, Gulf-EuropeanFreight Association Agreement, North Europe-U.S. Gulf Freight AssociationAgreement, U.S. Atlantic-North Europe Conference Agreement, and North Europe-U.S.Atlantic Conference Agreement and their members show cause why they shouldnot be found to be in violation of section 10(c)(1) of the Shipping Actof 1984 for taking concerted action resulting in an unreasonable refusalto deal and, if found to be operating in violation of section 10(c)(1)of the 1984 Act, why the Agreements should not be disapproved, canceledor modified by the Commission;   It is further ordered That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of1984, the North Europe-U.S. Pacific Freight Conference Agreement, Gulf-EuropeFreight Association Agreement, North Europe-U.S. Gulf Freight AssociationAgreement, U.S. Atlantic-North Europe Conference Agreement, and North Europe-U.S.Atlantic Conference Agreement and their members show cause why they shouldnot be found to be in violation of section 10(a)(3) of the Shipping Actof 1984 for operating other than in accordance with the terms of the underlyingconference agreement, which prohibits taking concerted action resultingin an unreasonable refusal to deal and, if found to be operating in violation,why the Agreements should not be disapproved, canceled or modified by theCommission;   It is further ordered That should it be determined that North Europe-U.S.Pacific Freight Conference Agreement, Gulf-European Freight AssociationAgreement, North Europe-U.S. Gulf Freight Association Agreement, U.S. Atlantic-NorthEurope Conference Agreement, and North Europe-U.S. Atlantic ConferenceAgreement and their members have operated in violation of sections 5(b)(5),5(b)(8), 10(a)(3) or 10(c)(1) of the Act the matter may, pursuant to section13 of the Shipping Act of 1984, be referred to an Administrative Law Judgein an appropriate proceeding to determine whether penalties should be assessedand, if so, the level of such penalties;   It is further ordered That this proceeding is limited to the submissionof affidavits of fact and memoranda of law;   It is further ordered That the North Europe-U.S. Pacific Freight ConferenceAgreement; Gulf-European Freight Association Agreement; North Europe-U.S.Gulf Freight Association Agreement; U.S. Atlantic-North Europe ConferenceAgreement; North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conference Agreement; and their respectivemembers are named Respondents in this proceeding;   It is further ordered That the Commission's Bureau of Hearing Counsel bemade a party to this proceeding;   It is further ordered That any person having an interest and desiring tointervene in this proceeding shall file a petition for leave to intervenein accordance with Rule 72 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,46 CFR 502.72.
