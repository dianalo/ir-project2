Pick up 3rd pvs, `Also today...'</HEAD><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 100 people, mostly East Germansfrustrated with delays in a promised mass exodus from Hungary, fledacross the border to Austria during the night, a Red Cross officialsaid today.   In Budapest, the Communist Party leader, Rezsoe Nyers, said todaythat thousands of East Germans waiting in refugee camps to go toWest Germany would be able to leave ``in a short time.'' But hewould not say when. Pressure on Hungary from Warsaw Pact ally EastGermany has delayed the transfer.   Also today, West German officials in East Berlin said all 116East Germans who had holed up in the West German mission there hadleft the facility.   Eberhard Grashoff, a spokesman for the mission, said the EastGermans left the compound this morning after they were promised``extensive legal counsel'' in their efforts to leave the country.   The would-be emigres had been living in the mission for more thana month, demanding West Germany's help in getting permission toleave.   West Germany's decision to harbor the East Germans, many of themfamilies with small children, had strained relations between Bonnand the Communist leadership in East Berlin. More than 300 otherEast Germans remain in West Germany's missions in Czechoslovakia,Poland and Hungary.   Red Cross officials in Austria said that besides East Germans,today's new arrivals included Romanians, Czechoslovaks and oneGhanaian, said Heinrich Unger, head of the Red Cross in Austria'seastern Burgenland province.   Austria has a policy of giving asylum to all political refugees.   About 6,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany, takingadvantage of Hungary's decision in May to remove borderfortifications with Austria. Hungary has been seeking closer tieswith the West as it reforms its Communist political and economicsystem.   Another 6,000 East Germans, many of them people vacationing inHungary, flooded refugee camps in recent weeks to take advantage ofa one-time sanctioned migration apparently tacitly agreed to byHungary.   The prospective exodus has worsened tensions between Hungary andEast Germany, which has spurned the liberal reforms embraced tovarying degrees in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.   Austrian volunteers have opened four reception centers along theborder for the East German arrivals. Unger said a fifth washurriedly set up in the changing rooms of a sports ground overnight,after one group of 32 East Germans arrived at a crossing point nearthe small town of Nikitsch.   ``We don't know if we'll keep it open, whether this was a singlegroup or the start of a trend,'' he said. ``We can't just open upanother reception center every place the groups arrive.''</TEXT></DOC>
