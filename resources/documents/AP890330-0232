Jobs said university officials nationwide had encouraged him toget his Next Computer System onto the retail market.   ``They told us they think we've got a revolutionary product. Butthey said we've got to get it out into a broader market so theirstudents will see it when they get into the workplace aftergraduating,'' Jobs said at one of his typically glitzy newsconferences.   With the announcement, Jobs _ often described as a guru of thepersonal computer industry _ formally launched a race to capture amajor market share of a new generation of computers, machines thatcould revolutionize the industry and redefine personal computing.   Jobs, president of Next Inc. and co-founder of Apple ComputerInc., confirmed at the news conference that a distribution deal hadbeen signed with Businessland Inc., which has 112 outlets andannual sales last year of $1.2 billion.   The agreement will give Jobs' Palo Alto-based company greatervisibility. It will also speed up development of software and deala blow to rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which had been negotiatingwith Businessland and other resellers over the same distributionrights.   ``This deal is a major coup for both companies,'' said JonathanSeybold, a leading computer industry expert. ``It givesBusinessland an extremely attractive product ... and it gives Nextthe premiere company for selling high-end computer desktop systemsto the public.   ``I think the industry has been frankly just stunned by thisdevelopment, because now it's become clear Jobs is a seriouscontender in the industry once again.''   More than two dozen software developers also attended the newsconference, where they unveiled an array of programs that Jobs sayswill make the Next an incomparable office, research and educationaltool.   The Businessland deal was particularly important for softwaredevelopers because they view it as a move to put the machine intowide circulation, thereby assuring a larger market for theirprograms, which Next needs if it hopes to set industry standardswith its operating system and thereby establish itself as theindustry leader.   Jobs announced software development was already under way atseveral companies, including Adobe Systems Inc., Lotus DevelopmentCorp. and Sybase Inc.   The retail price of his machine is expected to be between$10,000 and $12,000. There was no immediate announcement of price.   Jobs claimed last fall that his Next computer initially would besold exclusively to educators and students at a discounted price of$6,500. He said he would not venture immediately into the businessmarket.   Bruce Lupatkin, analyst for Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. in SanFrancisco, called that claim a ``smokescreen ... Anybody who isawake would realize you couldn't build a big business inworkstations and avoid selling to the corporate and technicalmarket. I don't believe it is a shift in strategy; it's a shift intactics.''   The worldwide market for general-purpose and technicalworkstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in costfrom $8,000 to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growingrapidly. Such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilitiesover standard personal computers, particularly in visual displays,speed and mathematical calculations.   Next Inc.'s workstation is a sleek, black magnesium-boxedcomputer which features an erasable optical disk drive that canhold about 200,000 typewritten pages of information. It is Jobs'first product since his 1985 ouster as chairman of Apple ComputerInc., which he co-founded in the 1970s in a garage.</TEXT></DOC>
