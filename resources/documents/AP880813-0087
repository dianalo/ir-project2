Hundreds of students caught police by surprise when they chargedout of Yonsei University to attack troops encircling the campus totry and stop radicals assembling for a march Monday to the border.   Troopers were sleeping or resting when students charged them,hurling firebombs and lashing out with iron bars and clubs. Atleast three troopers were knocked senseless and dozens of othersinjured as they tried to fend off blows with shields or fled.   ``Advance national reunification!'' and ``Yankees go home!'' theprotesters chanted.   Police were forced back by the rampaging students until hundredsof reinforcments were rushed up from nearby sidestreets to drivethe howling protesters back with volleys of tear gas.   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said many officers andprotesters were injured, but no figures were available. Police saiddozens of students were arrested.   About 200 students demonstrating at Myongdong Roman CatholicCathedral in the center of Seoul earlier tried to break throughsurrounding police lines with firebombs but were driven back.   More than 3,000 riot police surrounded Yonsei in western Seoulto block the march to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talkswith communist North Korean student delegates on reunification. Thegovernment banned the march and police are on top alert to block it.   Meanwhile, a group of North Korean students who hope toparticipate in the talks arrived on Saturday at Kaesong, a bordertown near Panmunjom, the North Korean Central News Agency said in areport monitored in Tokyo.   It said the students marched from the northern part of thepeninsula to Pyongyang, where they boarded buses to continue theirtrip toward Panmunjom.   The report didn't say how many students were involved.   In South Korea, about 4,000 students, many from other cities,managed to get past the police cordon around Yonsei University. Butdozens of students were halted and taken away by police whoquestioned and searched people approaching the school. Policeofficers beat and kicked some detained students.   Student leaders said they would go ahead with the march despitethe massive police deployment. ``We will never, never give in,''said one.   Kim Yong-kap, minister of government administration, said thestudents were becoming a threat to stability and the administrationmight have to take drastic measures to suppress violent protests.   President Roh Tae-woo said Friday that violent protests were athreat to the Olympics, to be held in Seoul Sept. 17-Oct. 2, andsaid the government would not tolerate continued unrest.   Student protests over the past week in support of Monday's marchhave been relatively small with just a few thousand people takingpart.   The students want to meet with North Korean student delegates atPanmunjom for talks on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula. Theyalso demand removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea undera treaty and contend Washington backs military rule in the country.   Most South Koreans oppose the talks, and riot police blocked asimilar march in June. Turnout for the rallies for the latest marchhas been lower than in June.   Several hundred shopkeepers and residents staged demonstrationsin Seoul to demand students stop violent protests. Residents livingaround Yonsei demanded students abandon the march.   ``This is terrible. People are against this,'' a middle-agedbusinessmen complained as he watched students fighting police.   Radical students seized on the reunification issue to try andmobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. Thestudents, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed togain support because of violent tactics and open advances to thetotalitarian north.   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of WorldWar II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the KoreanWar.</TEXT></DOC>
