(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of an American held hostage inLebanon since 1985 said Tuesday she had been optimistic until theU.S. Navy shot down an Iranian jetliner, prompting an unconfirmeddeath threat against him.   Peggy Say said she previously had been told that her brother,Terry Anderson, might be released over the Fourth of July weekend,but those hopes were dashed by Sunday's attack in the Persian Gulf.   ``I had really high hopes when we came down here last week thatit would be over before anything like this could happen,'' she saidby telephone from her new home in western Kentucky.   Her concern Tuesday, however, was over an unconfirmed threatthat Anderson, who was abducted March 16, 1985, in Beirut, Lebanon,might be executed in revenge for the U.S. attack Sunday on thejetliner carrying 290 people. There were no survivors.   ``I'm trying to take some comfort in the fact that Islamic Jihadhas told us repeatedly that if a photograph does not accompany thecommunication, then it's not official,'' Mrs. Say said.   But she added, ``I am, of course, concerned.''   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, has been held the longest of 18 foreign captives in Lebanon.   An anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad, whichholds Anderson and American Thomas Sutherland, threatened to killone of them in retaliation for the attack.   The caller did not elaborate, and it was not possible toauthenticate the call.   Mrs. Say said she had mainly been thinking about two thingssince the U.S. guided missile cruiser Vincennes destroyed thejetliner.   ``The grief the families of the victims are going through, andTerry. I keep thinking about how terribly frightened he may be,''she said.</TEXT></DOC>
