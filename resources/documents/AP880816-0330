(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Washington state authorities today saidthey have seized up to 900 crab pots illegally placed in U.S. waterby Canadian fishermen, and a local politician calls it a case of``low-seas piracy.''   The pots contained more than 10,000 pounds of prime Dungenesscrab, valued at about $25,000, said Tom Burton, a fisherman andWhatcom County councilman.   The crabs were returned to Boundary Bay because the U.S. harvestfor Dungeness crab closed last spring.   About 850 to 900 of the traps were pulled in Saturday, Sundayand Monday, 600 of them on Monday, said Lt. Lyle Nelson of thestate Department of Fisheries.   The pots were found about a half-mile to a mile south of theCanadian border, which cuts across the more than 10-mile-wide mouthof Boundary Bay, authorities said.   ``This is low-seas piracy,'' said Burton, who was among thefishermen who helped remove the pots. ``We've been hearing rumorsabout this for quite some time. Over the winter, our drag fishermenhave been snagging Canadian pots'' in their nets.   ``We've been telling state fisheries people all summer thatthere was a problem,'' Burton said. ``It's nothing to see a draggerreturn with 20 Canadian crab pots on the stern.''   Last week, Coast Guard and state officials arrested threeresidents of Vancouver, British Columbia, suspected ofn a normal summer,Avery said.   ``What were living through now is the same thing we were livingthrough in 1980,'' in terms of a natural disaster, he said.   Normal death rates nearly doubled from Oklahoma east during a1966 heat wave _ with deaths jumping to five times normal in St.Louis _ according to the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   The Senate Special Committee on Aging later reported that heatwaves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11,000 lives.   And a University of California at Berkeley study found that hotspells in Los Angeles in 1939, 1955 and 1963 each produced moreexcess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state,including the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.   Those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly, who mayalready suffer various ailments, Avery explained. Indeed, in 1980the elderly made up 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hotweather, he said.   ``Several factors contribute to this increased vulnerability toheat stress, including less cardiovascular stamina, heart damage,less responsive blood vessels, underlying diseases and a decreasedability to sweat,'' the Senate aging committee reported.   In addition, it noted, the elderly use more prescriptionmedications, and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity toheat.   Heat-caused deaths do not arouse the concern they should becausea uniform reporting system has not been established, Avery said.   As a result, only classic cases of heat stroke get officiallyreported as heat deaths, and those amount to perhaps 200 in anormal summer and 1,500 to 1,600 in a hot summer like 1980, heexplained.   Still not attributed to the heat are the thousands oftemperature-induced heart attacks, strokes and other fatalailments. They are only measured later, when deaths in the hotyears can be compared to more normal ones and the excess calculated.   ``We have very accurate assessment of what crop losses are goingto be, and it seems we are more concerned about corn than about ourpeople. I think that's a tragedy,'' Avery said.   Death and illness aren't the only heat-wave related problems;heat affects work attendance and productivity, depending on theregion.   A five-year study by researchers at the University of Delawarefound that hot weather increases work attendance in the Sun Beltbut reduces it in other areas of the country.   Attendance rates remain high in hot-weather cities where airconditioning is common at home, work and car, the study found. Butrates drop off when the the weather cools slightly and workers wantto engage in outdoor tasks and recreation.   In northern cities, however, work attendance dips as peopleunaccustomed to hot, muggy weather lose sleep and suffer otherdiscomfort.</TEXT></DOC>
