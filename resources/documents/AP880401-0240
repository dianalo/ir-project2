In New York, more than 2,000 anti-arms race marchers walked forpeace at an annual Good Friday rally that ended with actor MartinSheen, the Rev.

The Sixth Good Friday Peace March began at the United Nationsand ended at the Riverside Research Institute, where the protestorganizers, Pax Christi Metro New York, said research is conductedon President Reagan's proposed ``Star Wars'' anti-missile program.   Pax Christi spokesman Jim O'Grady estimated that 90 to 100protesters were arrested after walking inside the institute andblocking the door in a non-violent protest. Police Officer JimColeman confirmed the arrests, but did not have exact figures.   Philadelphia police charged 116 people with disorderly conductand blocking the street in front of a clinic that performsabortions, said Cpl. Robert Ward. The two offenses carry fines of$25 to $100 each, he said.   After police carried the demonstrators away, the clinic opened.Abortion opponents said they would continue a prayer vigil outside,but would not block the entrance.
