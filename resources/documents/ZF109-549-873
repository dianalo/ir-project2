Why not rely onWindows to handle fonts? The answer is that Windows, though completelygraphical, does not handle fonts well.andM;At the root of the problem is Windows 3.0's inability to scale screentypefaces accurately.andP;  If you decide to use the type families that Windowsgives you (Times Roman, Helvetica and Courier) you'll see well-formed fontson the screen, but only if you use the sizes that Windows provides by default(8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 and 32 points).andM;If you request a point size that's a multiple of an existing screen font(say, 28 points), Windows simply doubles (or triples or whatever) the bitmapit already has in memory.andP;  The resulting screen font is more jagged andblocky than the original.andP;  On the other hand, if you ask for a size that isnot a multiple of an available size, Windows cheats, approximating the fontyou request with the next smaller size in its library.andP;  Onscreen you'll see,line for line, the words that will appear when the text is printed, but thespacing between words may seem strange because the size of the onscreen fontis incorrect.andP;  This approximation, called &quot;representative justification,&quot; isa clumsy solution at best.andM;ATM, FaceLift and Publisher's PowerPak, on the other hand, work byintercepting calls from the application to GDI.EXE (Graphic DeviceInterface), the Window,,, 3.0 program that provides screen services toWindows applications.andP;  Rather than retrieve fonts from Windows' memory-hungrybitmaps, these programs summon a typeface outline--a mathematicalrepresentation of the character--and apply a scaling factor to it.andP;  Afterscaling the letter, the program rasterizes it, converting the graphic imageof the character into a bitmap in RAM, and sends it to the screen or theprinter.andM;All three products support any application that uses Windows' native screenconventions.andP;  All three are simple to operate, too.andP;  In most cases, just loadthe software and forget it's there.andP;  If you select a block of text and pulldown a font menu from within a Windows application, the new typefaces will bethere.andM;Choose any typeface, specify a point size supported by the application (Wordfor Windows, for example, supports sizes ranging from 4 points to 127 points,in half-point increments) and watch as the fonts change on the screen.andP;  Onceyou've installed one of these packages, you won't need to deal with it unlessyou want to enable or disable it, install or remove a typeface outline orchange the size of the font cache.andM;As each product scales type to the screen, the fonts are cached in RAMbecause the programs all assume that if you're using 10-point Times Roman,you'll need that font again later in the document.andP;  Each program lets youchange the size of the font cache.andP;  Depending on the font sizes you normallyuse, you might want to increase the cache size for better performance.andM;Of the three products, only FaceLift lets you store the contents of the fontcache to disk between Windows sessions; when you boot up into Windows again,all your fonts mill be as you left them.andM;In deciding which of these products suits you best, consider the quality ofthe final output, your investment in typeface outlines of one species oranother and the cost of add-on type outlines.andM;How can you benefit from the new scalable typeface technology?andM;It depends on your needs:andM;1.) Do you need high-quality text output using industry-standard (for now)PostScript font formats? Do you need a cross-platform solution that works notonly under Windows 3.0 but with the Macintosh and with a future version ofOS/2's Presentation Manager?andM;If so, choose Adobe Type Manager (ATM) for Windows.andP;  ATM offers the widestselection of typefaces, with typeface packages available from all the majordigital type foundries.andP;  And only ATM is currently available both underWindows and on the Macintosh  running under the current System 6.x software).andO;Other cross-platform font options, such as TrueType, won't appear untilSystem 7.andM;Plus, IBM has demonstrated a version of OS/2 Presentation Manager with theAdobe Type Manager technology embedded in the operating system.andP;  Formultiple-platform environments, ATM is the surest bet.andM;2.) Do you want all the advantages of scalable-font technology but don't needMacintosh or OS/2 compatibility? Do you still want high-quality text outputfrom a leading vendor of type with a wide variety of fonts?andM;If so, consider FaceLift from Bitstream.andP;  FaceLift provides the same bellsand whistles as Adobe Type Manager but is available only for the PC runningMicrosoft Windows (Bitstream has been mum about supporting the Macintosh orOS/2).andP;  Bitstream offers a vide variety of high-quality typeface outlines,but FaceLift supports only Bitstream's own Speedo font format for both screenand printer.andM;3.) Do you want the benefits of scalable-font technology without spending alot for add-on typefaces?andM;In this case, the choice is Atech's Publisher's PowerPak.andP;  Like FaceLift andATM, Publisher's PowerPak can scale printer and screen fonts on the fly.andP;  Butit can be used with only a limited number of fonts.andP;  Although the baseselection is virtually identical to the others (Times Roman, Courier andHelvetica), and the variety of additional packages is good (a total of 26additional packages are available, with 53 typefaces), you will not find thegreat variety of typefaces in Atech's library that you'll see offered byAdobe and Bitstream.andP;  On the plus side, this product is coded for fasterprinting than the other two.andM;We tested the three packages with Windows 3.0 running in 386 Enhanced mode onan IBM PS/2 Model 80 with 8MB of system RAM and a standard VGA monitor.andO;Because we looked at both Adobe Type Manager and FaceLift in beta form, wedidn't conduct any empirical performance tests, but both beta versionsperformed reliably on our test system.andM;ADOBE TYPE MANAGERandM;Adobe Type Manager for Windows is the only cross-platform alternative in thisnew family of products.andP;  If you exchange files with Macintosh users, you'llappreciate the fact that ATM is already available for the Macintosh.andM;Adobe Type Manager is also the choice to consider if you have a largeinvestment in PostScript fonts.andP;  Since ATM will work with any Type 1PostScript font outline, all your Adobe fonts will work correctly with ATM.andM;Adobe Type Manager's installation process is Windows-based and requiresWindows 3.0 for its operation.andP;  The setup program first asks where you wantto install the program files.andP;  The installation process copies an ATM ControlPanel to your Windows subdirectory.andP;  Among other items, the ATM Control Panellets you determine the size of your font cache and whether to use ATM duringyour Windows session.andM;A very useful feature of the manual is a brief paragraph describing how toremove the ATM system from your computer.andP;  Many vendors tell you how toinstall their software; few tell you how to remove it.andP;  Another nice touch inthe manual is a collection of tips and hints for optimizing Adobe TypeManager with certain Windows applications.andM;As shipped, Adobe Type Manager includes 13 typeface outlines: four faces ofTimes Roman, four of Helvetica, four of Courier and one symbol face.andP;  Adobealso offers a large variety of add-on PostScript typefaces.andP;  For example, theAdobe Plus Pack ($198) contains 22 typefaces, which supplement the 13 shippedin the base ATM product to deliver the original 35 typefaces found in mostPostScript printers.andP;  In addition, the Adobe TypeSet I and TypeSet 2 packageswill each contain seven popular display typefaces and sell for $99 each.andP;  Ofcourse, you can also buy any other regular PostScript fonts for $95 to $370per- package, depending on the typefaces.andP;  ATM is compatible with PostScriptoutlines that are available from type houses such as Adobe, Bitstream,Compugraphic and Monotype.andM;Adding typeface outlines is a snap.andP;  Once you buy a PostScript Type 1 outlinefrom a vendor, simply place the disk containing the outline in a disk drive.andO;From the ATM Control Panel, click on Add and the program will prompt you forthe drive that contains the typeface outline you want to install.andP;  Then,select the outlines with the mouse and click on the Add button again.andP;  AfterATM copies the appropriate files onto your hard disk, you'll need to restartWindows.andP;  Once you do, each of your Windows applications will be able toaccess the new typefaces.andM;Adobe Type ManagerandM;$99, Adobe Systems Inc.andM;1585 Charleston RoadandM;Mountain View, Calif.andP;  94039andM;(415)  961-4400andM;FACELIFTandM;Bitstream's $99 base product includes the FaceLift program plus 13 typefaces:four weights of Times Roman (called Dutch by Bitstream), four weights ofHelvetica  called Swiss), one monospaced Helvetica font (useful forspreadsheets or other columnar data) and four decorative faces (Cooper Black,Formal Script, Park Avenue and Brush Script).andM;Once you've installed FaceLift, the fonts are available onscreen and at theprinter.andP;  FaceLift does not replace the fonts installed by the currentWindows printer driver; it supplements them.andP;  So, for example, if you have aPostScript driver installed, FaceLift will give you access to the PostScriptprinter fonts (but not screen fonts) in addition to the FaceLift fontsinstalled.andM;FaceLift, like the other packages, operates transparently as you work withinyour Windows application.andP;  The installation program is Windows-based, and,unlike ATM, which requires Windows 3.0, FaceLift works with Windows versionsas far back as Version 2.03.andM;FaceLift normally works only with fonts created with Bitstream's proprietarySpeedo font format.andP;  However, the program also provides a way to installPostScript outlines.andP;  The PostScript faces work only at the printer, butBitstream plans to release a set of 35 Speedo outlines (Bitstream FaceLiftCompanion Pack for PostScript, $179) that yield exact onscreen matches toPostScript outlines.andM;FaceLift can also create soft fonts compatible with HP LaserJet printers.andO;This is especially useful for faster printing of long documents because youcan build one or more soft fonts and download them to the printer beforeprinting.andM;One welcome feature of FaceLift's font cache is its ability to &quot;remember&quot; thefont cache contents when you exit from Windows.andP;  The next time you boot up inWindows, all the fonts most recently used will be restored to the cache.andM;FaceLift supports any Speedo format font from Bitstream's library.andP;  Bitstreamis the only company to support the Speedo format and has not licensed thetechnology to anyone else.andP;  So if you have a big investment in PostScriptfonts, you're better off with ATM.andP;  Bitstream's typeface library isimpressive: 52 outline packages, each with four faces (weights); each packagecosts $129.andP;  Bitstream has also developed a $199 Value Pack, which includesnine families of popular typefaces (24 typefaces).andM;FaceLiftandM;$99, Bitstream Inc.andM;21 5 First St.andM;Cambridge, Moss.andP;  2142andM;(800).522-FONTandM;PUBLISHER'S POWERPAKandM;Atech's Publisher's PowerPak answers the need for an inexpensive solution tothe cost of add-on fonts.andP;  With additional typefaces from Bitstream at $129per family and from Adobe at up to  370 per package, the low cost of Atech'sadd-on typeface packages is attractive.andP;  Unfortunately, Atech's typefacelibrary is limited: You may not find the typeface you need, and many of thePowerPak faces can't match the quality of type available fromstandard-setting vendors like Adobe and Bitstream.andM;The installation process creates a PowerPak subdirectory under the Windowsdirectory and copies several system files into it.andP;  Any added fonts fromAtech are copied into this subdirectory.andP;  Unlike ATM and FaceLift, theinstallation process is not a Windows application.andP;  Also, be careful whenreading the regular 23-page manual for PowerPak; it contains some outdatedmaterial.andM;When the installation program is complete, you must install the correctdrivers (unlike ATM and FaceLift, PowerPak does not work with the existingWindows printer driver), a very simple operation.andP;  With the install programcompleted, go into the printer setup area in the Windows Control Panel; thePowerPak driver appears, just like a regular printer.andP;  Select the PowerPakdriver and set it up for the port to which your printer is linked.andM;Finally, press Setup to get into the Publisher's PowerPak driver dialog box,which you can set for paper size, printer resolution (75, 150 or 300 dots perinch on a LaserJet, for example), paper orientation and the number of printedcopies you want.andM;At this point, tell PowerPak what kind of printer you're using.andP;  The list ofprinters supported is impressive, including hundreds of laser and dot matrixdevices.andM;Publisher's PowerPak has been updated for Windows 3.0, but it also runs underearlier versions of Windows.andP;  Although the program works with Windows 2.1,you cannot scale typefaces to the screen.andP;  Instead, you'll have to creatematching screen fonts manually.andP;  Publisher's PowerPak will correctly scalefonts to the printer with either Windows version.andM;Atech's typefaces do not use standard names.andP;  The outline families that areincluded with the product, for example, are Cobb  equivalent to Courier),Dixon (Helvetica) and Marin (Times Roman).andP;  Fortunately, it's a simple matterto rename each face.andP;  Add-on Atech typeface packages cost $29.95 each; nineforeign language typefaces sell for $79.95 each; and you can purchase 15typefaces licensed from Monotype for $79.95 each.andM;Publisher's PowerPakandM;$79.95, Atech SoftwareandM;5964 La Place Court, Suite 125andM;Carlsbad, Calif.andP;  92008andM;(800) 748-5657, (619) 438-6883andM;THE LAST WORD ON TYPE TERMSandM;The art of typography, though transformed by computers, retains many quaintwords from its hot-metal past.andP;  Even veteran PC users, however, disagree onprecisely what the following terms mean.andP;  Here are the correct definitions.andO;Type family: A group of typefaces of similar design.andP;  The Helvetica family iscomposed of typefaces such as Helvetica Bold, Helvetica italic, HelveticaBold Condensed and so on.andP;  Typeface: A specific type design, such asHelvetica Condensed Bold.andP;  The outlines discussed in this article areoutlines that follow a specific type design.andP;  Once a typeface is scaled tocertain size, it becomes a font.andP;  Font: A specific size of a specifictypeface.andP;  Example: 10-point Helvetica Condensed Bold.andP;  A font is not thesome as a typeface, although the terms are often--and mistakenly--usedinterchangeably.andM;DO I STILL NEED A POSTCRIPT PRINTERandM;With Adobe Type Manager and Windows 3.0, you can coax PostScript output fromalmost any non-PostScript device.andP;  So, was it foolish of you to buy thatexpensive PostScript printer?andM;The answer depends on what kind of work you do.andP;  Although ATM generatesPostScript text, it can't handle graphics.andP;  You still need a PostScriptprinter to produce graphical effects such as halftoning.andM;PostScript provides a complete imaging model of type (new color extensionsare due in the next revision).andP;  ATM produces high-quality text on the screenand on the printer, and it con take advantage of PostScript fonts in theprinter to improve printing speed.andP;  instead of creating a bitmap using thePC's resources and sending the bitmap to the printer (as it would to anon-PostScript printer), Adobe Type Manager sends PostScript commands to aPostScript printer and lets the hardware handle the tough stuff.andM;Also, if you need to generate text and graphics on a high-end typesettingsystem such as a Linotronic, PostScript remains the best bet forindustry-standard compatibility.andM;TRUETYPE: THE AUTHORIZED ALPHABETandM;TrueType, developed by Apple and licensed to Microsoft, is destined to have ahuge impact on the future of PC typography.andM;Like Adobe Type Manager, TrueType runs on a variety of platforms--AppleSystem 7, Microsoft Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  Although there isno technical reason that TrueType can't run on System 6.x software, Appleplans to implement the technology only in its soon-to-be-introduced System 7operating system software.) As with ATM, documents created on a Macintoshwill be identical to those created on a PC running Windows or OS/2.andO;Microsoft plans to build the TrueType technology into future versions ofWindows and OS/2.andM;Also like ATM, TrueType works with any Windows application that uses thefont-management system calls  (APIs) built into the three graphicalenvironments.andM;End users will find that current font-scaling solutions such as Adobe TypeManager operate much as TrueType does.andP;  After you install both products,simply select a typeface and point size.andP;  The rasterizer scales the typefaceoutline both to the screen and to the printer.andM;Under the covers, however, TrueType fonts are fundamentally different fromthe Adobe PostScript and Bitstream Speedo format files.andP;  Most font vendorsuse a proprietary format to implement &quot;hints&quot;--additional information thatserves to improve the resolution of typefaces at smaller point sizes.andO;TrueType's hinting technology will not be proprietary, so type vendors willbe able to add TrueType hints to their outlines and quickly &quot;port&quot; their typelibraries to the TrueType format.andM;TrueType's rasterizing technology will be bundled with future versions ofWindows.andP;  And there will a wide variety of type offerings with TrueType,since many type houses-including Bitstream and Monotype--have pledged tooffer typeface outlines in the TrueType format.andM;NEW TYPEFACES FOR PC PRINTERSandM;Professional typographers use high-resolution typesetting equipment that conproduce output al 2,540 dots per inch.andP;  The fonts they traditionally use aredesigned with these high densities in mind.andM;Although higher-quality output devices for PCs, such as plain-papertypesetters (often offering resolution of up to 1,000 dpi), are appearing andprices are dropping, many of us publish documents on standard 300-dpi laserprinters.andP;  As a result, electronic type foundries have designed faces(Adobe's Stone Sons and Bitstream's Charter, for example) that are optimizedfor lower resolutions.andM;Typefaces that require strokes slightly off the vertical or horizontal don'treproduce well at low resolutions.andP;  The IT( Eras type design, for example, isset two or three degrees off center, and at small point sizes, the 'stairstep' effect becomes pronounced.andM;The Optima type family can exhibit problems at low resolutions, too.andP;  Optimais known for its flared stems with subtle curves in the middle.andP;  Whenreproduced at a low resolution, the stems appear to have the some width atthe top and bottom, but they  jump&quot; in the middle because the output devicecan't reproduce the slight curves.andM;in general, the typefaces that are best suited to loser printers don't havedelicate features such as small serifs or subtle curves.andP;  So type vendors aredesigning typefaces that will retain their character whether they're printedon a 300-dpi laser or typeset on a 2,540-dpi machine.andM;in the meantime, what can you do to improve the appearance of yourlaser-printed documents? The best way to determine how a typeface will appearis to print what typographers call a  'watefall'--the same sentence printedat a variety of point sizes and weights--to assess which size produces themost readable characters.andM;ACCURAT SCREEN RENDERINGandM;Adobe Type Manager (ATM), FaceLift and Publisher's PowerPak all work byintercepting calls to Windows 3.0's screen interface.andP;  As thesebefore-and-after screen samples (produced using ATM) show, the new fontadd-ins do a much better job than Windows alone in rendering screen fonts.andO;in these examples, ATM is working with Word for Windows and PageMaker.andO;Similar results are possible with any application that uses Windows 3.0'snative screen and font-handling conventions--virtually everyWindows-compatible application.andP;  All three add-ins are shipped with thestandard typefaces that are included with Windows: Times Roman, Courier andHelvetica.andP;  Each product offers additional type libraries in PostScript orproprietary formats.andM;These print samples show how Adobe Type Manager, FaceLift and Publisher'sPowerPak improve printed output, allowing even dot matrix machines to printscaled type.andP;  Without these add-ins, applications are at the mercy oftypefaces and sizes already installed on the printer.andP;  But these font add-insbypass the printer's installed fonts and send accurately scaled type directlyfrom the application to the printed page.andP;  Again, the key to these results isthe font add-ins' ability to scale and rasterize typeface outlines on thefly, a task that Windows alone cannot do.andP;  All the printer has to do isduplicate the bitmap sent to it by the font add-in.andP;  (Note that the large  inthe middle of the page is a graphic and therefore is not altered by such fontproducts.)andM;COMPARING THE QUALITYandM;Output from each product illustrates that, though different, all three renderindividual letters well.andP;  The telling distinction among the three is in theway letters are spaced horizontally and vertically.andP;  Both the ATM andFaceLift type have consistent color (or black-and-white value) throughout thetype sizes and both base align (that is, though the letters might not be thesame size physically-FaceLift's characters set a bit wider--the verticalspace between the lines should be identical if both are given the sameleading).andP;  By comparison, Publisher's PowerPak type displays poor color.andP;  Thetype is significantly larger than in the other two, the baselines are setmuch too closely, and the horizontal spacing between the letters isinconsistent, giving a clotted appearance at smaller sizes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
