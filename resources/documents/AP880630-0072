Demjanjuk, 68, was sentenced to death on April 25, a week afterbeing found guilty of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a brutal guardwho operated gas chambers that killed 850,000 Jews at the Treblinkadeath camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistakenidentity.   Israeli attorney Yoram Sheftel said the appeal asks the SupremeCourt to reverse the conviction ``due to lack of proof and muchmore than substantial doubt.''   ``Alternatively, we are asking the court to eliminate the deathsentence,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview at theSupreme Court.   Sheftel said the appeal challenges ``every finding of the courtas far as facts and legal aspects'' and accuses the three DistrictCourt judges of handling the case in a ``biased and uncivilizedway.''   In the 101-page appeal, the defense contends two photo spreadsused by Treblinka survivors to identify the defendant were``impermissibly suggestive.''   Sheftel also quoted the appeal as saying the court failed tointroduce any evidence challenging Demjanjuk's version that he wasa Nazi prisoner-of-war during 1942 and 1943, when Treblinka was inoperation.   He said the defense also criticises an ``organized massivecampaign by the Israeli press ... against the defendant whichcompletely undermined any possibility of a fair trial.''   Sheftel said he visited Demjanjuk last week at his maximumsecurity prison cell in the Ayalon Prison near Tel Aviv: ``He wasfine. He is optimistic and looking forward to the appeal.''   Supreme Court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said a five-judge panelheaded by Chief Justice Meir Shamgar will begin hearing the appealDec. 5. It will be held for three consecutive days, then foranother three days from Dec. 12-15, Cohen said.   The prosecution is scheduled to reply between Dec. 19 and Dec.29.   Demjanjuk moved to the United States after World War II,settling in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He was stripped of hisU.S. citizenship after a court ruled that he had lied on hisapplication to become an American.   If the court rejects the appeal, Demjanjuk may become the firstman to be executed in Israel since Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmannwas hanged in 1962 after a trial in Jerusalem.   Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official who promoted the use ofgas chambers for mass extermination of Jews and oversaw the murderof millions of Jews in World War II, was kidnapped by the Israelisin Argentina in 1960.</TEXT></DOC>
