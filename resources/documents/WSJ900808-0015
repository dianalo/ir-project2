Bank of England officials adopted this relatively flexibleapproach as they set out rules governing Britain's freeze onIraq and Kuwait assets in the U.K. The freeze was imposedafter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but the terms of the policyweren't spelled out until yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   British officials said that while assets of theLondon-based Kuwait Investment Office are included in thefreeze, normal portfolio management should continue.   &quot;We're working with the KIO to try to devise for them aregime where they can operate their portfolio management asfreely as they choose so long as their assets don't leavethis jurisdiction,&quot; said one bank official. The main goal ofthe asset-freeze is to keep the Iraqi government from seizingcontrol of the investment arm, whose holdings are estimatedat $100 billion.   The KIO has been a major player in world markets, owningshares in dozens of British and Spanish companies, as well asseveral West German concerns, including Hoechst AG andDaimler-Benz AG.   Also included in Britain's asset-freeze is KuwaitPetroleum Co. Bank of England said that consistent with thegoal of keeping these assets beyond the reach of the Iraqiforces occupying Kuwait, local offices of the oil concernwould be able to carry on normal commerce.   The British freeze on assets covers both residents andinstitutions from the two countries. Kuwaiti institutions candraw on U.K. accounts to make pension and salary payments toKuwaiti citizens living in Britain.   The rules governing the freeze of Iraqi assets don'tprovide for the same leeway. Bank of England officials notedthat Iraqi assets in the U.K. are far smaller than theKuwaiti assets. The Bank of England said it will considergiving permission for withdrawals of Iraqi funds needed tocover medical emergencies or travel costs of Iraqi citizenswishing to return home.   The Bank of England estimated that British banks haveabout $1 billion of claims on Iraq currently. The currentrules don't provide for Iraqi assets to be confiscated insupport of these claims. But bank officials said that in theevent of a default, &quot;they would be subject to the normallegal process.&quot;   The Bank of England has established a 10-person &quot;emergencyunit&quot; to administer the rules. Violations could be prosecutedas criminal offenses.   The U.S., Japan and other major European nations have allimposed their own freeze-orders on Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets.Bank of England officials said there will be future effortsto coordinate the procedures and regulations each countryadopts.   One problem, for example, is that the Bank of Englandrules don't apply to foreign branches of U.K. banks. However,officials said that U.K. banks won't be allowed to transferKuwaiti assets to foreign branches. &quot;We don't want this tobecome a bypass,&quot; said a Bank of England official.</TEXT></DOC>
