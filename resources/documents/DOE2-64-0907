In our study, we noninvasively measured posturaldisequilibrium with a microprocessor-based force platform. The test providesa real time quantification of the body's center of gravity movement pattern.Measurements were made in a cohort of 33 inner city children (mean age:six years +/- 0.4 SD) with well documented blood lead histories. Theaverage maximum blood lead of these children during their first six yearsof life was 23.5 micrograms/dl (range = 8.5 to 49.4). The children performedfour postural tests [i.e., standing eyes open (EO) and closed (EC), onfirm surface and standing on a compliant foam surface with eyes open(FO) and closed (FC)]. The results indicated that the maximum blood leadincurred during the second year of life was significantly positivelyrelated to postural sway, and the body balance was most affected in theEC test where visual cues were eliminated and proprioceptive feedbackwas not modified. Fetal Pb exposure levels as well as Pb exposures duringthe first year of life were not correlated with postural sway of sixyear olds. However, the maximum blood lead concentration beyond two yearsof life was significantly associated with the postural sway at six yearsof age.</TEXT></DOC>
