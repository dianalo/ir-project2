One solution? New computer languages that make it possible to produce more software faster.    Currently, for example, only 5% of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s software developers use the company's more advanced C++ language to write applications software, says Robert Factor, a director at ATandamp;T's Bell Laboratories.    The higher level C++ language enables developers at ATandamp;T and at other companies to write programs using &quot;object-based&quot; patterns, Mr. Factor says. Such patterns separate the details of how to perform a task from the commands to execute the task. When programmers order the software to &quot;print,&quot; for example, there is no need to provide the details of how and where to print; those separate instructions are already embedded in the program.    &quot;You don't worry about details. You just say, 'Run this test,' and the software understands what you want to test and executes the proper set of instructions,&quot; says Mr. Factor. Developers can produce three to four times more software using C++ than ATandamp;T's more conventional C language, he says.    Eventually all ATandamp;T developers will learn the new language, Mr. Factor says. Meantime, ATandamp;T and its Sun Microsystems Inc. computer partner plan to rewrite ATandamp;T's Unix computer operating system in the C++ language in the early 1990s.    Service Widens Vista   Of Voice Messaging   EXECUTIVES ARE the target of a new voice-messaging service that will not only take and forward messages but will do other tasks such as helping to make restaurant reservations.    William F. von Meister, who founded the Source, a computer data-base company, is behind the start-up concern, Phone Base Systems Inc., of Vienna, Va. The service plans to beat the Bell companies into the voice messaging and storage business by starting operations next month.    Phone Base will provide subscribers with an 800 number that connects to a central computer. Using voice-imprint technology, the computer will keep a record of the subscriber's voice and up to 32 numbers. Subscribers will be able to use the service to make long-distance calls, leave messages, and forward messages to a particular number.    Phone Base says that Marie, the name of the talking computer, also will be able to help make restaurant reservations. Callers will tell the computer where they'll be, and Marie's voice will provide information on various restaurants in that city. The computer then will dial up the restaurant the caller chooses. Similarly, the service will be able to order deliveries of candy or flowers from certain vendors.    How Grocers May Save   On Their Own Shopping   THE COMPUTER gap between grocery-store receiving clerks and food deliverers may soon be bridged.    Nowadays, drivers delivering snacks, soft drinks and other products often use hand-held computers to keep track of deliveries and prices. The grocery-store clerks are similarly equipped and use wands that read the universal price codes off merchandise to enter delivery information into central computers.    Although the technology has tightened inventory controls, it has also lengthened the time it takes to deliver the goods while the drivers and store clerks separately do their computer checking. A new computer system is being developed, however, to bring the two tasks together.    In a project managed by the Arthur D. Little Inc. consulting firm of Cambridge, Mass., a group of grocery stores and suppliers nationwide are testing the system, which allows deliverers to enter information directly into the hand-held computers of the receiving clerks. Among the participants, says Richard Norris of Arthur D. Little, are the Safeway, Price Chopper, and Vons supermarkets.    Last fall, Arthur D. Little developed the communication standards that permit the data interchange. Mr. Norris says the system, if widely adopted, could save the grocery-store industry at least $500 million a year.    Phone Calls as Fast   As the Speed of Light   THE FASTEST commercially installed light-wave transmission systems transmit 1.7 billion bits of data per second. At standard, noncompressed digital speeds for voice conversations, that means 24,192 phone conversations can be handled simultaneously.    These systems upgrade systems that were transmitting 417 million bits of data a second, or the equivalent of about 6,000 simultaneous conversations.    To make the increased capacity possible, the newer systems use gallium arsenide semiconductors in place of traditional silicon chips in the systems' regenerators, which reshape and boost light pulses.    ATandamp;T's Bell Laboratories is now experimenting with a transmission system that could send light pulses more than 4,000 kilometers without regeneration. Currently, light signals transmitted on fiber-optic cables must revert every 20 to 100 kilometers to an electronic signal, then be reconverted to light by a laser, a process that limits the system's capacity.    The new system would simply use a laser to &quot;pump up&quot; the energy level in the light signal, eliminating the electrical conversion and thereby boosting capacity significantly. </TEXT></DOC>
