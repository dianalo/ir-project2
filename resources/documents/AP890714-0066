From 1984 through 1987, the Taggarts' combined net worth climbedfrom $171,000 to $1.7 million, NCNB Bank branch manager Judy Baileysaid Thursday, citing personal financial statements she was providedby the Taggarts for an unsecured line of credit at the bank.   The Taggarts are charged with evading $487,000 in federal incometaxes from 1984 to 1987. Prosecutors say they diverted $1.1 millionin ministry funds to their own use by using ministry credit cardsand then using blank ministry checks to pay off the cards.   On their 1983 statement, the Taggarts listed their net worth at$171,075, she testified. By 1987, their net worth was listed at$1,695,837, including $600,000 in jewelry and more than $350,000 inartwork.   James Taggart, 35, is an interior decorator. In late 1984 hedecorated the hotel suite for PTL President Jim Bakker. His brother,David, 32, was Bakker's deputy from 1980 until spring 1987, whenBakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter informed jurors that they wouldnot have to return until Monday morning. Potter also told the jurythat the prosecution expected to rest its case Monday morning andthat the defense would begin.   Justice Department lawyer David Brown said he expects to completethe government's case with two hours of testimony on Monday.   Defense attorney Ben Cotten said he expects his case to last oneto two weeks.   Testimony by Bakker is a ``real possibility,'' Cotten said.Bakker faces trial next month on other charges growing from a16-month federal investigation of the -bankrupt ministry.   Meanwhile on Thursday, a PTL accountant testified he haddifficulty getting the Taggarts to provide documentation for cashadvances made to them by the ministry.   James Guinn, a certified public accountant hired by PTL at thetime it was audited by the Internal Revenue Service, said he helpeddraft a letter recommending David Taggart be fired if he did nothand over the documentation.   Guinn testified that the action was necessary as the ministryprepared to appeal any sanctions by the IRS, including revocation ofits tax-exempt status.   ``They needed to show that as soon as they found the problem,they took the appropriate steps,'' Guinn said.   Guinn, who specializes in tax-exempt religious organizations,said he was never able to convince David Taggart to turn over anyrecords.   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each couldbe sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $1million.</TEXT></DOC>
