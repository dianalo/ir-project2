Cluster boxes are centralized mailbox groupings used in manyapartment and townhouse developments, and some new residentialareas. They allow letter carriers to deliver mail for several homesat one spot, saving time on their rounds.   The GAO, which does investigations for Congress, studied the useof the boxes at the request of Reps. William D. Ford, D-Mich.,Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Robert Garcia, D-N.Y.   The report covered fiscal 1985, when about 1.9 million of the 53million daily city mail deliveries involved cluster boxes.   According to the study, in areas of detached homes, deliveringmail to a cluster box instead of to a curbside mailbox saved about$10 per customer, for a saving of $4.5 million.   In townhouse sections, the Postal Service saved about $11 percustomer by delivering to clusterboxes instead of to mailboxeslocated by the door of the home. That netted a saving of $6.9million, the report said.   For low-rise apartment buildings, the cost of delivering to acluster box was about the same as bringing mail to a group of boxesin the lobby.</TEXT></DOC>
