Haslip created nodue-process problem even though it was 200 times the amountof the actual injury. In this case from Alabama, the justicesemphasized that a new state law means &quot;the Alabama SupremeCourt's post-verdict review ensures that punitive damagesawards are not grossly out of proportion to the severity ofthe offense and have some understandable relationship tocompensatory damages.&quot; The justices concluded that theAlabama system &quot;ensures meaningful and adequate review by thetrial court whenever a jury has fixed the punitive damages.&quot;   March 8, 1991: The Alabama Supreme Court invalidated thevery protection in the state law against excessive punitivedamages that the U.S. Supreme Court cited to uphold thefairness of an award. The justices struck key parts of thestate's 1987 tort reform. These included provisions that &quot;nopresumption of correctness shall apply as to the amount ofpunitive damages awarded&quot; when the appeals court reviews thefairness of awards and that appeals judges &quot;shallindependently reassess the nature, extent and economic impactof such an award.&quot; The state justices ruled that the statelegislature can't tell judges how to limit punitive damages.</LP><TEXT>   A dissenting Alabama justice noted that despite what theU.S. justices said in Haslip about how the state protectsdefendants' rights, this new opinion shows that the procedure&quot;is neither meaningful nor adequate to protect a defendant'sdue-process rights.&quot; He concluded that the Haslip case now&quot;seems hollow,&quot; that the &quot;Supreme Court of the U.S. wasmistaken&quot; to trust the state's system for protecting the dueprocess rights of parties hit with punitive damages.   This four-day lifetime for the relevance of a SupremeCourt opinion may set a new record. This slap in the faceshould also give the justices new reason to set out abright-line test for when punitive damages can be assessed --such the original requirement of intentional, egregiousinjuries.   If the Alabama flip-flop isn't enough incentive for thejustices to fix the punitive-damages problem, they might wantto start keeping a close eye on the kinds of abusive casestheir vague standard on punitive damages now encourages.Consider a case unusual only for how well it sets out theabsurdity of lottery-style punitive damages. The case comesfrom an only moderately deep-pocket picking state (WestVirginia), but involves a politically correct cause(environmentalism) with a dream defendant for anycontingency-fee plaintiffs' lawyer (Ashland Oil).   Ashland Oil has operated a refinery along the Big SandyRiver since the 1920s in an area bounded by West Virginia,Kentucky and Ohio. It also causes pollution in the form ofoil droplets and flakes of material. But it pollutes lessthan other area plants, less now than in years past and, inany case, at levels that comply with federal Clean Air Actstandards.   Even so, Rod Jackson, a Charleston, W.Va., contingency-feelawyer, performed the legal alchemy of transforming a nothingcase into pots of gold. Last year he won a $10.3 million juryverdict for four area residents, $9 million of it in punitivedamages. He has lined up nearly 300 more plaintiffs. Almost700 more area residents have asked to sign on as newplaintiffs. At this rate, Ashland Oil could face totalliabilities of some $3 billion.   The reason for so many plaintiffs is that everyone withinseveral miles of the refinery could probably collect underthe legal standard applied here. The lawsuit claimed thewell-established tort of nuisance, but the trial courtapplied a new test -- or rather hardly any test at all -- tohold Ashland Oil liable. Under the traditional test ofnuisance, it's a defense that a situation has existed foryears and compliance with a federal law often means there canbe no legal liability. Here, the trial judge seemed to telljurors there is an unqualified right to clean air.   One of the plaintiffs collected $2.3 million based onwatery eyes and itchy skin when he mowed the lawn and a&quot;rotten egg&quot; odor whose source he could not identify. Otherscomplained of damage to automobile paint. The battle of theexpert witnesses was typically inconclusive, but this clearlyis no asbestos-type harm.   One explanation for the enormous damages is that the trialjudge gave jurors little guidance on whether they couldassess punitive damages. Mr. Jackson, however, had plenty tosay on the subject.   &quot;It's going to take a lot of money to punish them,&quot; hetold jurors. &quot;They got a board of directors, a lot ofhighfalutin' people from New York City and places like that.And the only way that they're going to stop this behavior isif you hit them on the snoot enough. . . . {A} million or twomillion or five million or ten million isn't going to make itto the board of directors. That's nothing to them. That'speanuts.&quot;   &quot;Now talking very briefly about punitive damages, what'sthe purpose of that?&quot; he said. &quot;The purpose isn't a windfall.The purpose is that you have to decide what type of a legacy,what type of a bequest, do you want to leave to your childrenand grandchildren as to what this jury did in West Virginia.. . . It's going to cost them dearly in their corporatetreasury. Now that's what punitive damages is all about.&quot;   For good measure, Mr. Jackson also accused Ashland Oilover the years of bribing politicians at home and abroad. Henoted that several corporate officers were once sued for&quot;racketeering.&quot; Mr. Jackson noted that the RICO lawsuit wasfor damages, not a criminal case, but &quot;they committed whatwould be a crime if it were a criminal case.&quot;   This lawsuit has caused enormous friction in the areabetween people who have joined the lawsuit and those whothink it's silly. There have even been reports of threatsagainst the plaintiffs. The fact that Ashland Oil, Kentucky'sbiggest corporation, is a major employer in this poor regionhelps explain the depth of the split.   The West Virginia Supreme Court recently voted unanimouslyto hear Ashland Oil's appeal of the case. This means thatstate Justice Richard Neely, a prolific writer and legalscholar, will get the chance to offer his opinion. In hisbook, &quot;The Product Liability Mess,&quot; Justice Neely noted withunusual judicial candor and at least half seriousness thatout-of-state defendants often do have good reason to worry.&quot;As long as I am allowed to redistribute wealth fromout-of-state companies to injured in-state plaintiffs, Ishall continue to do so,&quot; he wrote. This case may push thepoint too far.   The issue of when punitive damages themselves becomepunitive won't go away until the U.S. Supreme Court comes togrips with the problem. In the meantime, expect many moreenormous and entirely unpredictable verdicts againstcorporations where the the size of the judgment has more todo with the depth of the defendant's pockets than with anyfault.</TEXT></DOC>
