<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0935 </DOCNO><TEXT>Nuclear spins and moments of {sup 9}Li and {sup 11}Li have been measuredby optical pumping of a fast atomic beam. The angular asymmetry of the{beta}-radiation from the polarized nuclei was used to detect the hfsof the 2s {sup 2}S/sub 1/2/--2p {sup 2}P/sub 1/2/ resonance line andthe NMR signal in a LiF or LiNbO{sub 3} crystal. The results I = 3/2and {mu}/sub I/ = 3.6673(25) n.m. indicate a pure 1p/sub 3/2/ state ofthe valence proton of {sup 11}Li. A first preliminary result for theratio of quadrupole moments is extracted from the NMR to be Q({sup 9}Li)/Q({sup8}Li) = 0.88(3).</TEXT></DOC>
