Wilkinson declined to discuss specifics. The Greenpeace ship hasbeen shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet in Antarctic waters forthe past week.   He said the Japanese, who claim the kill is necessary toscientifically determine whaling stocks, killed 10 whales onSaturday.   Japan has said it plans to hunt 300 whales this season, despite amoratorium by the International Whaling Commission.   ``We are redoubling our efforts to expose this project for whatit is: A simple slaughter of whales for commercial ends,'' Wilkinsonsaid.   He said said Greenpeace was told earlier Sunday that crews of thethree Japanese ships would use water hoses and clubs to repelGreenpeace protesters if they tried to board the whalers.   Greenpeace, which champions environmental and anti-nuclearissues, has been in the Antarctic for the past three weeks and hasenough provisions to stay in the region until the end of February,Wilkinson said.   He said the group probably will remain with the Japanese forseveral more days before heading south to monitor environmentalconditions at the U.S. base at McMurdo Sound, which it claims dumpstoo much waste onto the ice.   Greenpeace is campaigning to have the southern continent declareda world park. Antarctica is believed to hold rich mineral resourcesand Greenpeace fears that such exploitation could ignite militaryconflict.</TEXT></DOC>
