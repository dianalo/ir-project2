The bug infected hundreds of computers but apparently didn'tdestroy any files or research, said Professor James Bruce, vicepresident for information systems at Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology in Cambridge, Mass.   ``We're not crippled,'' Bruce said. ``It first showed up in themiddle of the night and spread very virulently during the day.''   The virus had slowed or halted dozens of computers at theCalifornia Institute of Technology in Pasadena by Thursday morning,but caused no permanent damage, said Bob Logan, systems manager ofCaltech's computing organization.   Some of the institutions affected were investigating theincident, but there was no known criminal probe underway.   Viruses, the communicable diseases of computers, are tinyprograms which are created in computers either as a joke orvandalism. They can attach themselves to other programs and spreadthrough shared software.   In their mildest form, a message flashes on a user's screen; asmalignancies, they can destroy data and cripple a computer.   ``This (virus) program tries to find all the machines it can talkto, copies itself into those machines, and then it starts doing thesame thing again,'' Logan said.   Caltech experts believe the virus entered their computers throughARPANET, a network established by the Defense Department's AdvancedResearch Projects Agency.   ``ARPANET is a nationwide computer network that ... reaches tojust about every university in the United States,'' Caltechspokesman Bob Finn said. ``It lets researchers communicate data andtext very easily.''   Spokesmen at Boston University, Stanford University, ColoradoUniversity and the NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View,Calif., also said their systems had been infected.   ``This is electronic vandalism,'' said John Porter, associateprovost at Boston University.   At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, in Livermore,Calif., spokesman Jeff Garberson said a computer problem wasdiscovered late Wednesday.   ``We ... took action to contain it, which means to stop it fromspreading to other computer systems. We were successful by about 1in the morning,'' about five hours after it was discovered.   ``This is for unclassified, non-secured systems,'' saidGarberson. ``It did not affect our classified national defensesystem at all.''   The lab's work includes design of the nation's nuclear weaponsand key work in the Strategic Defense Initiative. ``We are nowpowering back up and should have all these unclassified systems backon line by tomorrow,'' Garberson said.   ``It was benign it that it didn't cause any damage,'' said GerardNewman, a member of the technical staff at the San Diego SuperComputer Center at the University of California, San Diego. `` Butit was incredibly prolific _ it attempted to find as many computersas it could to infect. It slowed three systems here.''   At Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., the virus ``was mainly justslowing down systems and slowing data. ... It just chokes computers.... Our people are saying no data were destroyed,'' said Bob Beyers,a school spokesman.   The New York Times in its Friday editions, said unidentifiedcomputer security analysts were calling the virus ``the largestassault ever on the nation's computers.''   The Times said the virus apparently was released by a computergraduate student trying to sneak what he thought was a harmlessvirus onto ARPANET, where the program was supposed to remainundetected.   The Times said an anonymous caller identifying himself as anassociate of the student called the newspaper and said the viruswent awry because of a programming error that caused it to replicateitself much faster than intended.   ``The student realized his error shortly after letting theprogram loose and ... was now terrified of the consequences,'' theTimes said.   The Defense Communications Agency set up an emergency center todeal with the problem, the newspaper said.   ``This has the feel of somebody who was sitting around thinkingone night over a beer, `Hey, I can write a virus. Let's see whathappens,''' said Charley Kline, senior research programmer with theComputing Services Office at the University of Illinois atUrbana-Champaign, Ill.   Kline said he uses the term ``virus'' to mean a self-spreadingprogram, though some call such a program a ``worm'' unless it doesdamage. He said he knew of no damage caused by the program Thursday.   Kline said university officials disconnected their computers fromoutside networks about 8 a.m. CST, when the virus was discovered,and connected them again about noon when the system apparently waspurged of the invading program.   Contact with other universities showed the virus also infectedcomputers at Boston University, Purdue University, the University ofWisconsin at Madison and the University of California at Berkeley,Kline said.   ``This is the first time that I know of that it (virus infection)has happened on this scale to larger systems,'' Kline said.   Kline said the virus traveled between computer systems through aprocess in which computer operators usually send ``electronic mail''to each other.   He said once the messages were received, they linked up tocommand controls, and told the local computer to make copies of thevirus. He said the copies then sought out other connected machinery.   He said that as far as he knows, only locations using VAXcomputers, made by Digital Equipment of Maynard, Mass.; or Suncomputers made by Sun Microsystems Inc., of California, wereaffected.   Kline estimated that about 75 percent of all national networksuse such computers.   All of the affected computers use the same operating system, ormaster program, that allows a computer to run other programs, Logansaid.   The operating system, named BSD UNIX, was written by Universityof California, Berkeley, computer experts and is a modified versionof the UNIX operating system produced by American Telephone andamp;Telegraph, he said.   Logan said he believes the virus came through the ARPANETconnection because at least some of the times the virus enteredCaltech's computers Wednesday night, it came from computers atNASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif,. and atLawrence Berkeley Laboratory In Berkeley.   All the computers are connected by ARPANET, he said.   The virus also infected a network called Science Internet thatserves many scientists and research labs, including NASA's JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, said JPL spokesman Jim Wilson.   NASA's Science Internet office at Amers Research Center alertedJPL computer specialists of the virus' presence in Internet shortlyafter midnight Thursday, Wilson said in a prepared statement.   ``Within an hour, JPL has disconnected from the NASA ScienceInternet and also from MILNET and ARPANET, two other research anddevelopment computer networks,'' Wilson said. ``No damage tohardware, software or data was found.''   He said a ``software patch'' was developed to protect againstthis type of virus and the networks will be reconnected only afterthe patch has been installed and tested, within a day.   John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Associationin Santa Clara, Calif., said Thursday's virus was rare because itinfested computers at major institutions, not just personalcomputers where most viruses are generated and duplicated.   ``Any hacker in the world can infect personal computers,'' McAfeesaid by telephone. ``But in this case, the person who did this wouldhave had to have been physically at the site of one of the computersbelonging to the network.''   He said chances of identifying that person were ``extremelyslim.''</TEXT></DOC>
