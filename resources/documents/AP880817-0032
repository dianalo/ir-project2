John Vinich defeated twoopponents Tuesday night in a hotly contested Democratic primary forthe nomination to oppose Republican U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop inNovember.   Wallop coasted to his third Senate nomination, amassing 39,130votes, or 83 percent, with 351 of Wyoming's 474 precincts reporting.   With the same 74 percent of the precincts reporting, Vinich had15,821 votes, or 47 percent, to University of Wyoming law professorPete Maxfield's 9,833, or 30 percent. State schools SuperintendentLynn Simons, who entered the race late, had 7,619 votes, or 23percent.   ``It appears that we are down to the one-on-one,'' Wallop said.``It's my hope that the campaign will stay on a high plane becauseWyoming doesn't have time to focus on personalities when the issuesand leadership are so important.''   Wallop had four opponents in the primary _ Michael Dee, RussHanrahan, Nora Marie Lewis, or I.W. ``Bud'' Kinney _ but they didnot conduct highly visible campaigns.   In the race for Wyoming's only House seat, Democrat BryanSharratt was unopposed while five-term incumbent Dick Cheneydefeated Bob Morris, as he had two years ago. Cheney had 32,320votes, or 87 percent, to 4,728 for Morris, or 13 percent inincomplete, unofficial returns.   ``I look forward to a good, hard-fought campaign in the fall andI hope I have the privilage and opportunity to serve them for twomore years,'' Cheney said from New Orleans, where he was attendingthe Republican convention.   Cheney, however, will get off to a slow start against Sharratt.On Friday the five-term incumbent will enter a Washington, D.C.,hospital for heart bypass surgery.</TEXT><TEXT>   A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Wyoming's secretary of statemust count absentee ballots received through Aug. 22 to protect therights of voters living overseas.   ``It is certain ... that there are some absentee ballots thathave been sent out too late ... and I think that that is animportant thing that all people's proper ballots should becounted,'' U.S. District Judge Clarence Brimmer said. ``That'salmost something that's as basic as our democracy itself.''   While the Justice Department prefers that ballots be mailed 30days before an election, some of Wyoming's 23 counties mailedballots only 26 days before the primary.   Wallop, 55, Wyoming's senior senator, spent little time visiblyworking for the nomination.   There were no confrontations between Wallop and Lewis, whocampaigned on an anti-political action committee stance; Dee, whoadvocated legalization of marijuana; Hanrahan, a retired airtraffic controller; or Kinney, who once tried to defeat Wallop'spredecessor, Democratic Sen. Gale McGee.   Instead, Wallop stressed his record of the past 12 years,pointing to his support of Western water rights and a strongdefense and his efforts to reduce tax burdens on the oil and gasindustries.   Although Wallop pledged 12 years ago to remain in Washingtonjust two terms, he said challenges to Wyoming's way of life, itsenvironment and the state's and the nation's defense made a thirdterm necessary.   On the Democratic side, Vinich, a state senator from FremontCounty, spent much of his time on a vigorous door-to-door campaign.He also spent thousands on commercials designed to counter chargesthat he's too liberal for conservative Wyoming. He was backed bylabor and environmentalists.   Simons, halfway through her third term as state schoolssuperintendent, entered the race late but received the backing ofpopular former Gov. Ed Herschler.   Her campaign was overshadowed by mistakes on Federal ElectionCommission filings, a slow start on fundraising, and a controversyover her efforts to get a new car for the Education Department.   Maxfield, a tax law expert and University of Wyoming professor,called for an oil import tax to ``revive and stabilize an industrythat's vital to not only the national economy but I believe thenational defense.''</TEXT></DOC>
