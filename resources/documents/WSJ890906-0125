The Ireland National Drugs Advisory Board approved Cetus's IL-2 drug for use as a treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, or kidney cancer, Cetus said. There has been no effective treatment for the ailment, which kills most patients within 12 months of diagnosis.    The move is a boost for the biotechnology concern, which has had heavy losses while developing new drugs, including IL-2. Denmark and the Netherlands granted approval in July for IL-2, and &quot;Ireland was one of the important steps we had to go through,&quot; said Hollings Renton, Cetus's executive vice president and chief executive officer.    Cetus's way was paved in Europe earlier this year, when an advisory review panel for the European Community recommended that its 12 member nations approve the genetically engineered IL-2 drug as a cancer treatment. Cetus has set up sales branches in Britain, Italy, France, West Germany and Spain to prepare for the drug's European marketing.    &quot;We should be getting approvals regularly, beginning with more this month,&quot; said Mr. Renton. Cetus expects the rest of the EC to approve IL-2 within six months, he said. The Irish approval and those before it should also set a precedent around the world, he said. British Commonwealth countries &quot;really look to regulatory approval in Europe and the U.S.&quot; before granting their own approval, he said.    Cetus applied for marketing approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last November. Cetus says it expects FDA approval in the first half of 1990.    Cetus blamed drug-development expenses for its net loss of $49.9 million in the year ended June 30.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cetus shares rose 25 cents to close at $16.625. </TEXT></DOC>
