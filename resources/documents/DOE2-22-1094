The complex includes: an automatized devicefor irradiation of samples in vacuum with remote control ensuring theirchange for about 1.5 min, as well as computer-aided automatized devicefor measuring and processing spectra of dozens of samples. To determinecarbon, oxygen and nitrogen impurities by activation with helium-3 ionsand protons the methods of radiochemical isolation of analytical carbon-11and fluorine-18 isotopes are developed. The methods permit one to determinegas-forming impurities in more than 30 metals and compounds with therecord detection limits of 10/sup -6/-10/sup -7/ mas.%. Some applicationsof the developed methods for analysis of high-pure semiconductors aredescribed. 6 refs.; 5 figs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
