Mr. Bogle oversees the vast Vanguard mutual fund operations in Valley Forge, Pa., while also sitting on the board of Meritor Savings Bank, based in Philadelphia.    The suit, filed in state court in Philadelphia by two former Meritor employees, contends that Mr. Bogle abused his position by undermining Meritor's investment performance for the benefit of Vanguard, one of the nation's largest and most respected mutual fund families.    In a statement, Mr. Bogle called the charges a &quot;bunch of baloney.&quot; He couldn't immediately be reached for further comment; Vanguard officials said Mr. Bogle hadn't yet seen the suit.    Mr. Bogle has been on Meritor's board since 1971; his four-year term expires in 1990, according to a Meritor proxy statement. He also is a member of Meritor's finance committee, the proxy material said.    The suit, filed by Douglas Pyle and Edward Shute, two former officers of Meritor's fund operations, accused Mr. Bogle, Meritor and several of its officials of preventing Meritor from hiring employees away from Vanguard. The court papers also said that Mr. Bogle &quot;unfairly and irrationally criticized plaintiffs' methods of investment and fund management.&quot;    Messrs. Pyle and Shute were dismisssed by Meritor in July.    Meritor, which has five funds in the bond and money-market area with total assets of just $102 million, declined to comment on the suit.    Meritor's annual report said that its small fund operation is &quot;intended simply to retain and enhance customer relationships in our primary market of Philadelphia.&quot; The report said that as of the end of 1987, the funds had about 5,000 customers.    Vanguard, with 50 mutual funds, has $30 billion in assets.    The complaint alleges that Mr. Bogle attempted to force Messrs. Pyle and Shute to disclose their &quot;marketing strategies, investment strategies, methods, and other matters even though these were confidential trade secrets and proprietary.&quot;    Messrs. Pyle and Shute are seeking $3 million in damages from Meritor.    The court papers add that Mr. Bogle, in exchange for access and control over Meritor's funds, muted criticism of Frederick Hammer, Meritor's chairman, after the savings bank incurred losses late last year. Neither Mr. Bogle nor Mr. Hammer was named a defendant. Mr. Hammer declined to comment.    Meritor, which launched its fledgling mutual fund business in October 1986, has its annual shareholder meeting tomorrow. </TEXT></DOC>
