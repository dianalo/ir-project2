But when anti-abortion hecklers disrupted a Dukakis rally in Illinois last week, the Bush campaign, worried about precipitating a voter backlash, disavowed the action. &quot;George Bush won't speak out on it as forcefully as we wish he would,&quot; says Joseph Scheidler, who heads the militantly anti-abortion Pro-Life Action League.    The heat is being turned up by both sides of the abortion debate -- but they're getting a cool reception from the presidential candidates they're trying to help. Abortion &quot;is not an issue that this campaign needs to throw fuel on,&quot; concludes Bush aide Mark Gooden. Democratic political strategist Robert Squier agrees: &quot;It's one of those issues on which there are no winners, but there can be losers.&quot;    At first glance, the abortion issue seems tailor-made for this year's presidential contest. The two candidates have sharp differences, and activists on both sides are charged up because they believe the future of their cause rides on this election.    But both George Bush and Michael Dukakis find the issue too hot to handle. Each candidate's position on the subject upsets as many of his potential voters as it galvanizes. While Mr. Bush may appeal to social conservatives with his anti-abortion stance, he turns off some pro-choice women and young GOP libertarians; pro-choice Mr. Dukakis may appeal to feminists but lose out with ethnic Catholic Democrats he needs.    Nor does the issue fit with the political strategies each man is pursuing. Mr. Dukakis wants to concentrate on his primary economic and foreign-policy agenda. Mr. Bush's strategists feel he has already done enough to placate anti-abortion forces -- by endorsing a constitutional amendment barring nearly all abortions, highlighting the issue in his acceptance speech and the GOP platform, and selecting a right-to-life running mate -- and now should be reaching out toward the political center.    &quot;People just want the issue to go away,&quot; concludes Joanne Symons, a Democratic consultant.    Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman says that only about 10% of voters actually choose their candidate based on the abortion issue, and these are evenly divided for and against abortion rights. Polls have long found that a majority of Americans -- including a majority of Republicans -- support legalized abortions. But the abortion debate stirs deep passions that greatly amplify its political impact.    Those passions are further stirred by the likelihood that the next president could determine the fate of abortion rights by reshaping the Supreme Court. Three of the four justices who have supported abortion rights will be more than 80 years old on Inauguration Day, and even one departure during the next four years could tip the balance against the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling. (On Tuesday, Justice Harry Blackmun, 79, told a class of law students at the University of Arkansas that the landmark Roe decision, which he authored, might &quot;go down the drain&quot; as soon as the next Supreme Court term.)    The result is that both pro- and anti-abortion forces want to inject the issue into the political debate, whether the candidates want it there or not. Thus, Mr. Scheidler readies his &quot;Duke of Death&quot; placards and vows to stalk the Democratic nominee, while Naral issues its less-than-overwhelmingly sought endorsement.    When Mr. Dukakis -- who supported legislation establishing abortion rights even before the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling -- discusses abortion, he doesn't emphasize the issues of feminism or women's rights. Rather, he talks about the effects of recriminalizing abortion, raising the specter of women being prosecuted as criminals. In a theme aimed at voters sympathetic to Reagan-era get-the-government-off-the-backs-of-the-people arguments, he portrays efforts to outlaw abortion as an example of government intrusion into private decisions.    Meanwhile, Mr. Bush demonstrated the difficulty of the issue for him last week as he campaigned with Rep. Lynn Martin, a partisan Republican and important Bush ally who supports abortion rights. When local Rockford, Ill., reporters asked the vice president about anti-abortion militants, he told them that abortion shouldn't be &quot;a litmus test&quot; for candidates.    Mr. Bush isn't considered an anti-abortion hardliner at heart. It wasn't until his selection as Ronald Reagan's running mate in 1980 that he adopted a tougher anti-abortion posture, a change that some critics say came more from political convenience than hard principle. On the stump, he doesn't use the emotional rhetoric about &quot;the unborn&quot; that Mr. Reagan favors; his speeches keep the issue low key, emphasizing adoption as an alternative to abortion.    Even so, many right-to-lifers say they are satisfied that Mr. Bush will appoint anti-abortion judges if he is elected president. &quot;He doesn't have to showcase the issue as long as he's taken the stand that he has. Christian conservatives tend to believe him,&quot; concludes Marc Nuttle, who managed the presidential campaign of former television evangelist Pat Robertson.    The Scheidler group's scuffle last week at the Dukakis rally probably helped the Bush campaign by distracting attention from Mr. Dukakis's planned message, but it left Bush officials worried about future clashes. If the picketers continue to come across as extremists, they'll provide Mr. Dukakis an opportunity to show how tough he is in standing up to them, Democratic strategists say.    But Mr. Scheidler, whose confrontational demonstrations have stirred controversy even within the right-to-life cause, says he doesn't care. &quot;George Bush isn't my boss,&quot; he says. &quot;I picketed George Bush in 1980 because his position was too liberal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
