Maj. Gen. Gica Popa shot himself in the head Thursday at hisoffice in the Ministry of Justice, Justice Minister Teofil Pop tolda news conference.   Popa was rushed to the Bucharest military hospital, where hedied two hours later with his wife and daughter by his side, Popsaid. The military officer left a suicide note that asked forforgiveness, but did not explain the motive for his act.   Pop said the suicide was the result of a ``very gravedepression'' and said ``it is possible'' that it was related to theCeausescu trial.   A source close to the family, however, said that Popa had beentroubled by anonymous death threats, apparently from Ceausesculoyalists, for the past two months.   Pop said that he had recently asked Popa if he had beenthreatened after the trial, and the major-general said no.   The justice minister also confirmed that Popa's voice was theone heard on the video-recording of the Dec. 25 trial of Ceausescuand his wife, Elena, which was broadcast repeatedly on Romanian andinternational television.   The angry voice was heard interrogating the pair and thenannouncing that they had been sentenced to death for crimes againstthe Romanian people. The couple was then executed.   The identity of the person was not made public earlier ``toprotect the judges while there were still terrorists around,'' Popsaid. He used the word ``terrorists'' to refer to members ofCeausescu's secret police force, who fought revolutionary forcesfor about a week after the dictator was toppled Dec. 22.   Pop said Popa, who was the head of the Military TerritorialTribunal, ``had extraordinary prestige and was one of our bestjudges.''   The prosecutor-general's office and police were investigatingPopa's death, officials said.   News of the suicide coincided with the start of a trial inTimisoara of 21 former secret police officers charged in connectionwith scores of deaths in that city, where the revolution began.   It was the first trial of ex-officials accused of trying tocrush the revolution before it spread across the country.</TEXT></DOC>
