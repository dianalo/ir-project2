Condemns Israel For Alleged Human Rights Abuses</HEAD><BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The General Assembly condemned IsraelThursday for alleged human rights abuses and demanded it haltexcessive gunfire and restrictions on worship in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip.   The vote was 129-2, with one abstention in the 159-memberassembly.   The United States and Israel voted against the non-bindingresolution, and Liberia abstained. Other nations were absent.   The assembly resolution, backed by Arab, non-aligned andsocialist nations, also demands that Israel immediately halt itscrackdown and punishment of those participating in the 16-month-oldPalestinian uprising in the territories.   It was the latest in frequent U.N. condemnations of Israel andits policies. U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering described theresolution as ``confrontational,'' and a Israeli diplomat calledthe vote hypocritical.   Pickering said it ``does not improve the situation on the groundor advance the prospects for peace in the region.''   He said the United States seeks a comprehensive negotiatedsettlement that would provide for an exchange of territory forpeace, the security of all states and the legitimate politicalrights of the Palestinian people.   The U.S. envoy said the status quo in the occupied territoriesis ``untenable'' and called the April 13 deaths of fourPalestinians by Israeli gunfire in the West Bank town of Nahalin``a particularly serious tragedy.''   Israeli envoy Jeremy Nissim Issacharoff, first secretary at hismission, denounced the ``immense hypocrisy'' by Arab nations suchas Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Syria to condemn Israel.   He said the Saudi government does not permit religious freedomand slaughtered Iranian worshippers in Mecca several years ago.Iraq has killed thousands of its own Kurdish peopls and Syria hasmurdered Lebanese, he said, yet both nations lecture Israel aboutthe evils of occupation and violations of human rights.   The resolution expresses ``profound shock'' at the Israelikillings in Nahalin and cited restrictions on attendance at Moslemmosques during the holy period of Ramadan as a violation ofPalestinian rights to worship.   The resolution demands that Israel immediately halt itsviolations of the convention and respect all Palestinian rights.   The territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, were seizedby Israel from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.   At least 439 Palestinians have been killed since the December1987 start of the uprising, most by army gunfire, according to acount by The Associated Press. Eighteen Israelis have also died.</TEXT></DOC>
