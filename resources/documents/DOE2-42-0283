Of 37 patients with postoperative TSC studies, four had nopostoperative splenic abnormalities. Nineteen of the abnormal TSC studieswere followed with TSC studies 2 weeks to 14 months later; three showedno change, seven showed improvements,and ten became normal. One patientrequired splenectomy 2 days after pancreatectomy for splenic infarction;her TSC study showed no uptake. These data suggest that the spleen usuallysurvives splenic artery and vein resection. Absent splenic TSC uptakeraises the possibility of splenic infarction but usually improves.</TEXT></DOC>
