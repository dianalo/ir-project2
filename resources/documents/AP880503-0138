The tanks rolled north of Israel's self-designated security zoneand backed up hundreds of heavily armed troops who combed Lebanon'srugged southern foothills, searching for Palestinian guerrillas.   Lebanese police said Syrian forces went on ``maximum alert'' asIsraeli fighters neared Syrian troops. No clashes were reported.   The operation was part of a push into the southeastern Arkoubregion that began Monday evening. The army said the incursion aimedat smashing anti-Israeli guerrilla groups responsible for recentraids into northern Israel.   In the pre-dawn darkness, before helicopter gunships began trooptransport, Israeli artillery shelled areas around Ain Ata andseveral nearby villages. No one was reported hurt.   Then about 500 Israeli soldiers, armed with automatic weaponsand rocket launchers, were flown to the northern edge of Ain Ata, apolice spokesman said.   Six Israeli tanks and nine armored personnel carriers laterrolled into the town, about 1{ miles north of Israel'sself-designated security zone in south Lebanon.   Israel created the zone in 1985 after it withdrew its army,which had occupied Lebanon since 1982.   Israeli troops conducted what appeared to be a house-to-housesearch in the town, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition ofanonymity in line with standing regulations.   Before the search began Israeli troops sealed off all approachesto Ain Ata and five surrounding villages. Helicopters droppedleaflets calling on the population to cooperate in the search forguerrillas.   Only villagers who work for the Lebanese regular army wereallowed to leave. This reporter, who lives in Ain Ata, was alsoallowed to leave after he showed his Associated Press card.   Israeli troops also entered five other Arkoub villages policedby a Norwegian battalion of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southLebanon and conducted a 10-hour search for guerrillas, U.N.officials said.   They said the Israelis finished the search in the midafternoon.It was not clear whether anyone was detained.   Later Tuesday, about 400 ground troops were seen enteringLebanon from Metulla, in the far northeastern corner of Israel.Some flashed ``V'' for victory signs. Others sang Israelinationalist songs.   A police spokesman said the Syrian command ordered its estimated16,000 troops in the nearby Bekaa Valley on maximum alert. Ain Atais four miles from Syrian positions.   ``There have been no clashes, but the Syrians have their tanksdug in on hills overlooking the Israeli operational zone,'' thepolice spokesman said.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel's militaryoperation in Lebanon would not lead to a prolonged entanglement orprovoke a confrontation with Syria.   ``There's totally no danger of entanglement in Lebanon,'' Shamirtold Israel radio. ``I am certain that the Israeli army took intoaccount all the possibilities.''   He described the operation as part of Israel's policy ofconducting sweeps in south Lebanon and added: ``It is a usualaction of watching and securing the area from attacks byterrorists.''   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar saidin a statement that he ``deplores this further violation ofLebanese sovereignty.'' He also called for the withdrawal ofIsraeli troops.   In Washington, the Reagan administration called for withdrawalof all foreign forces from Lebanon.   Lebanon's central government in Beirut, its power eroded by 13years of civil war between pro-Syrian Moslems and Israel-alliedChristians, ordered its U.N. Ambassador, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodgea ``strongly worded complaint'' against the Israeli action with theSecurity Council.   An Israeli commander in Lebanon, who was not identified by name,said on Israel radio that he told soldiers:   ``This operation is not a night-long operation in which you goin now and return in the morning. Don't be speedy in pressing thetrigger ... but if you do shoot, you mean it seriously and shoot inorder to kill.''   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations force in southLebanon, said it appeared 1,500 to 2,000 Israeli troops wereinvolved in the operation. But Israeli sources said fewer than1,000 were taking part.   The operation was Israel's largest in Lebanon since February1986, when it sent more than 1,000 troops and dozens of tanks intosouth Lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by Lebaneseguerrillas. The soldiers were never found.   The 100-square-mile Arkoub was the main base of Yasser Arafat'sPalestine Liberation Organization guerrillas for cross-borderattacks into Israel before Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.   The region was then known as Fatahland, after Arafat'smainstream Fatah guerrilla faction. Palestinian and leftistguerrillas have lately been active again in the Arkoub and haveconducted several raids into Israel.   Israeli officials say the increase in cross-border raids islinked to the five-month Palestinian uprising in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The Israeli incursion followed two such raids last week in whichtwo Israeli soldiers and five guerrillas were killed.   Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, maintains 25,000 troops inthe Bekaa and northern Lebanon under a 1976 mandate from the ArabLeague to try to end Lebanon's civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
