(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FDDI AppliedandM;FDDI is well positioned to satisfy user demands for networks which go fasterand farther.andP;  FDDI or Fiber Distributed Data Interface is a fiber optic tokenring network that operates at 100M bits per second.andP;  It employs a redundant,counter-rotating ring strategy which provides fail-safe operation.andP;  Moreimportant, it incorporates extensive network management functions which addto its operational reliability, availability and general usefulness.andM;The standard is designed to allow up to 200 nodes per ring with twokilometers maximum separation from node-to-node.andP;  Thus, FDDI bringsprodigious LAN capabilities to the network implementer.andP;  Obviously, it ismuch faster than current IEEE 802.5 standards.andP;  It supports greater distancesand more extensive network management capabilities than 802.5implementations.andM;The FDDI standard is the result of the efforts of many organizations andindividuals which participate in the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)X3T9.5 Standards Committee, which is overseen by the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI).andP;  This Committee began its work in 1982.andP;  At thattime, leading contributors included Sperry Rand, Burroughs andHewlett-Packard.andP;  A typical committee meeting drew 20 or 25 individuals fromthese organizations.andP;  At the present time, committee meetings typically drawover 100 people with almost all of the major vendors and many of theimportant users represented.andP;  Digital Equipment Corporation has made majorcontributions to the standard during the last two years IBM, which always hada small presence on the committee, has more recently been making majorefforts on behalf of the ASC X3T9.5 FDDI.andM;[Editor note: For more on the specifics on the FDDI standard, see &quot;FDDI&quot;elsewhere in this issue.]andM;Applications for FDDIandM;It is often argued that networks are only used to 5% their throughputcapacity.andP;  One then concludes that networks are fast enough, as is.andP;  Thestatistic is correct but the conclusion is wrong.andM;From 1981 to 1983, networks were used to provide a rational wiring techniquefor connecting terminals to time-shared host processors.andP;  The traffic whichpropagated on the network was limited by the typing speed and reading speedof users.andP;  It was possible to connect 2,000 terminals to a single Ethernetand still have happy users.andP;  As terminals were replaced by PCs andworkstations, the traffic intensity increased.andP;  Speeds are still limited byuser host equipment.andP;  But now, speeds on the order of 1M-bits-per-second peruser host are typical.andP;  The Ethernet which could easily support 2,000terminals can support just 10 or 20 workstations.andM;Today, it is not unusual to find more than a hundred separate Ethernet andIEEE 802.5 Token Ring systems at a single site.andP;  To network these systemstogether, a high speed backbone is required.andP;  FDDI is very well suited tothis task.andP;  At the present time, the cost per FDDI node is certainly too highfor direct connections to a PC or low end workstation.andP;  Such nodes must beconnected to the backbone via MAC-layer bridges or routers.andP;  FDDI Will serveas a high speed highway that interconnects multiple local area networks, aswell as directly connects high performance workstations, mainframes andsupercomputers.andM;During the next few years, it is anticipated that file transfer capabilitiesin a typical workstation will be in the 10M- to 20M-bits-per-second range.andO;At these rates, FDDI capabilities will be fully utilized just as Ethernetcapabilities were utilized when workstations replaced terminals.andM;FDDI applications are not limited to backbone connections.andP;  FDDI will also beimportant for systems that require real-time response.andP;  These systems includea flight simulator or a process control application that require timelyresponses on the network.andP;  In both cases, the latency of the network has tobe short.andP;  That is, the network has to provide a short time for transport ofsometimes very small messages.andP;  Given that the network is very fast and thatmessages are typically very short, it is almost guaranteed that the networkwill be available when needed.andP;  This, in turn, leads to the low latencyrequired by the real-time applications.andP;  FDDI is being designed into a numberof applications where this property of the high speed network is needed.andP;  Forexample, it has been designed into the NASA Space Station.andM;A third important application for FDDI is the interconnection ofgraphic-intensive data.andP;  In this application, the data to be communicatedconsists of rather large files which must be delivered to the user in atimely manner.andP;  FDDI could be used in commercial publishing applications, forexample, where photographic quality materials are moved from disk farms toworkstations as part of the publishing effort.andP;  In another example, FDDIcould be used in radiology departments as a means for transferring highresolution radiology data from catscan to workstation to storage.andM;We usually think of high resolution graphic applications as limited tosophisticated, scientific and technical environments usually involving Craysor expensive catscan machines, etc.andP;  However, more mundane applications arebeing created and implemented at the present time.andP;  For example, it is clearthat American Express is scanning the customer receipts and digitizing them.andO;Current bills from American Express containe reproductions of these receiptsrather than the receipts themselves.andP;  This type of operation has twoimportant benefits.andP;  First, it improves operation efficiency andproductivity.andP;  In addition, it provides for much improved customer servicebecause all information is on-line.andP;  It is anticipated that FDDI will findmany commercial applications of this kind.andM;Current FDDI StatusandM;The FDDI standard consists of a number of documents.andP;  Each is associated witha portion of the system.andP;  At the lowest level, there is the PMD whichdescribes the characteristics of Physical Media Devices including fiber opticmodules, fiber cable and fiber bypass switches.andP;  The next layer is PHY whichdescribes the Physical Layer of the design.andP;  The Physical Layer includes thedata coding and synchronization approach.andP;  Next is the MAC or Media AccessControl specification.andP;  This describes the specific token ring algorithmcharacteristics defined for FDDI.andP;  Connecting all of these is SMT, theStation Management Standard.andP;  See the table in this article for the status ofthis standard.andM;Station management is the current critical task item.andP;  There is muchremaining work to do on the station management portion of the standard.andP;  Thecurrent target date for completion of SMT is December, 1989.andP;  Thus, it ispossible that a letter ballet on SMT will be issued in the first quarter of1990.andP;  What impact does this have on the implementation of FDDI?andM;Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) recognized that the station management portionof the standard would not be available for a long time when it began its FDDIchip set development.andP;  Thus, AMD provided chips to implement those parts ofthe standard which were relatively well-defined.andP;  The AMD chip set has theappropriate interfaces for a general purpose microprocessor which couldimplement SMT as that portion of the standard was defined.andP;  This approach wasa very sound idea given the constraints imposed by the FDDI standardsdevelopment process.andP;  It has proved to be relatively successful.andM;In particular, during the first quarter of 1989, Prime, Apollo Computer andSun Microsystems were able to demonstrate interoperability amongindependently developed FDDI components using the AMD chip set and generalpurpose microprocessor implementations of SMT.andP;  Specifically, the December,1988, version of SMT was used for the interoperability demonstrations.andP;  SinceSMT was implemented in general purpose microprocessors by these threeequipment implemters, it has been assumed by many that any changes in SMTwhich are written into the SMT standard could be accommodated by changes tothe microprocessor software in such FDDI components.andP;  In many cases, thisassumption has proved to be true.andP;  However, in February, 1989 a link errormonitoring protocol requirement was implemented in the SMT.andP;  This errormonitoring protocol requires very fast response from the FDDI components.andO;There is no way to implement the required link error monitoring protocol insoftware.andP;  Proteon found, for example, that it was necessary to add one PLAchip to our FDDI design in order to provide the link error monitoringfunction.andM;Interoperability IssuesandM;What constitutes interoperability?andP;  Interoperability is not a simple go/no-goissue, but includes shades of gray.andP;  We have seen interoperabilitydemonstrations from Sun, Prime and Apollo.andP;  But, what about DEC and IBM?andO;Ineroperability among the equipment from various vendors is measured in twoways.andP;  First, it must be possible to communicate a packet of data from theequipment of one vendor to the equipment of another.andP;  This precludes the useof private, closed protocols in the payload of the packet being transportedby the FDDI subsystem.andP;  It is anticipated that most of the early FDDIimplementations will use TCP/IP formatted packets.andP;  Nest, it is essentialthat nothing in the equipment of one vendor will cause the network to &quot;hang&quot;due to transmissions or interrogations from the station management portion ofanother vendor's FDDI implementation.andP;  The problem confronting implementersand users alike is simply stated:  will the equipment I design, build or buy,interoperate with implementations from major players like DEC, Prime, Apollo,IBM, Sun, Stellar, Silicon Graphics, Ardent and everyone else?andP;  Given thatmajor players like IBM and DEC have not made public their systemcharacteristics, the question is not answerable at this time.andM;Several silicon vendors are working on FDDI chip sets.andP;  Sumitomo appears tohave its own implementation of the FDDI standard as currently published.andO;National Semiconductor has been working on a chip set for quite some time.andO;It is also possible that Digital Equipment is working on a chip set althoughno public announcements have been made to that effect.andP;  It is likely that achip set will eventually be available from Motorola.andP;  Will these chip setsinteroperate?andP;  This is another question which is difficult to answer.andM;In the case of IEEE 802.5 Token Ring, there is one commercial source for chipsets -- Texas Instruments (TI).andP;  The TI chip set was the result of acontractual relationship between Texas Instruments and IBM.andP;  IBM was thedominant leader of the 802.5 standards development effort.andP;  Its dominance wasearned by virtue of its investment in the standards development process.andP;  Oneelement of that effort was establishing TI as a vendor of completelyinteroperable chips for use by other networking companies.andP;  In order toinsure interoperability, IBM defined thousands of interoperability tests forthe TI chip set vis-a-vis the IBM implementation.andP;  TI spent the better partof 1984 establishing basic interoperability between the two standardsimplementation.andP;  Why was this such a difficult exercise?andP;  The answer is notobvious.andP;  One major issue has to do with the way in which different companiesinterpret the same standard.andM;It is possible that some of the chip vendors who are currently implementingFDDI chip sets will misinterpret other portions of the standard.andP;  In thiscase, there is no dominant leader as there was in the case of 802.5 toestablish interoperability criteria.andM;FDDI FuturesandM;The smoke is clearing.andP;  We can see more and more of the nature of the FDDIoperational environment.andP;  Yet a number of questions still remain.andP;  Forexample, what will be the dominant concentrator strtegy for FDDI?andP;  Normally,wiring concentrators are used to enhance network reliability, maintainabilityand cost-effectiveness.andP;  Some of the concentrator proposals for FDDI are socomplicated that they do not fulfill any of these desirable goals.andP;  Othersare so simple that they don't provide required functionality.andM;The methods for interconnecting lower speed LANs to an FDDI backbone are notdefined by the standard.andP;  Some efforts have gone into defining bridgingalgorithms for FDDI.andP;  However, it is believed that such bridging strategieswill not currently be included in the standard so that the SMT document canbe completed in a timely manner.andP;  At this time, routers may provide the mostefficient, standard-based means of inter-connecting LANs to an FDDI backbone.andM;The question of SMT, interoperability, wiring concentrators and LAN to FDDIinterconnection will all be resolved over the coming year as FDDI makes itsformal debut in the high technology marketplace.andM;Howard Salwen is the founder and chairman of Proteon and has activelyparticipated on the X3T9.5 FDDI committee since 1983.andP;  Proteon, based inWestboro, MA, manufactures token ring PC LANs, internetworking and high speednetworks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
