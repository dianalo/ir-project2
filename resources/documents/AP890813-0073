Arab hospital officials said 11 Palestinians were shot andwounded Sunday in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   The death raised to 536 the number of Arabs killed in the20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain in the violence.   Also Sunday, one of Israel's leading religious figures said thatunder Jewish law, the concept of preserving Jewish lives tookprecedence over all other commandments, including settling thebiblical land of Israel.   But Rabbi Ovadia Yosef of the ultraorthodox Shas political partydid not make the anticipated religious ruling on returningterritories to preserve Jewish lives.   He said relinquishing territories at this time is not realisticbecause there is no Arab partner for peace.   Jewish settlers living in the occupied West Bank claim there isa religious imperative for them to settle there.   Yosef, addressing an assembly of about 1,000 ultraorthodox Jewsin Jerusalem, did not retract his statement made to EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak last month that Israel could returnterritories to avoid loss of lives in a war.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking at the same assembly,said he favored territorial compromise so Israel could maintain aJewish majority in its own state.   ``Between claiming our right to the (biblical) land of Israel _and I don't doubt that right _ and losing the Jewishness of thestate ... I want a Jewish state within its own borders with theJewish traditions,'' he said.   Rabin's left-leaning Labor party favors territorial compromisewhile Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc isopposed.   The latest Palestinian to die in the uprising was Fayez JaberAbu Obeid, 16. The army said he was shot during a clash with troopsSaturday at the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, and he diedat Tel Hashomer Hospital.   Also in the Gaza Strip, a 32-year-old taxi driver, MustafaDarwish Abu Dahrouj, was fatally shot Saturday, and Palestiniansources said he was killed because it was believed he collaboratedwith with Israeli authorities.   He was the 95th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs as asuspected collaborator.   Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at youthsthrowing stones at about 5,000 Palestinian workers applying forentry permits near the Erez crossing in the Gaza Strip, Arabwitnesses said.   An army spokesman said troopers dispersed rioters but no one wasinjured seriously. He would not say if tear gas and rubber bulletswere used.   Israel, in an effort to limit the uprising, is requiring allPalestinians with jobs in Israel to have entry permits.   Both Israel and leaders of the uprising are trying to controlthe workers' movements.   A military official said the fighting at Erez began afterofficials turned away hundreds of people from an application officebecause of the large number of workers waiting. The office has beenhandling up to 1,000 applicants daily.   About 50,000 Gazans work in Israel and for many families theirjobs are the only income. The military official said about 40,000permits have been issued.</TEXT></DOC>
