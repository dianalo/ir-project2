The ring acts as thesolitary limiter beyond the smooth carbon tile vacuum vessel wall. Themere presence of the poloidal ring limiter broadens the current profilerather than narrowing it by the reduced aperture, and raises the necessaryone-turn voltage needed to sustain the current. The magnetic fluctuationfrequency spectrum for both m=0 and m=1 poloidal modes is shifted tohigher frequency in discharges with the ring limiter. The observed voltageincrease is compared with that predicted by two recent edge helicityloss models. (author). Letter-to-the-editor. 8 refs, 5 figs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
