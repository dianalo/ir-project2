His surprise support after pressure by House Republicansled by Rep. Gingrich upsets White House plans to bashDemocrats for doing nothing on the economy. Advisers fearsuch rhetoric will goad the Democrats into passing amiddle-class tax cut that Bush will have to veto --reinforcing the party-of-the-rich tag. Pollster Teeter fretsvoters will blame Bush if his rhetoric doesn't produceresults.</LP><TEXT>   But conservatives in and out of the administration wantthe president to be more aggressive on economic policy thanhis advisers have urged. The grassroots GOP, oneadministration official says, wants Bush to &quot;mix it up withthe Democrats, stand for something, even if we lose&quot; on theissue.   GOP Senate leader Dole, skeptical of his House colleague'stax-cut push, warns of &quot;the Gingrich that stole Christmas.&quot;                                                                                                          GETTING READY: Bush urged to make changes for hisre-election campaign.   With his administration reeling from missteps, some oldfriends counsel the president to &quot;clean house&quot; by firingSununu and setting up his campaign structure at the sametime. Insiders say the combative chief of staff has only a50-50 chance of holding his job. Former GOP Rep. Frenzel, alongtime Bush friend, is rumored as a possible Sununureplacement or new domestic-policy &quot;czar.&quot;   Bush may announce his 1992 campaign committee as early asnext week. One possibility would be to give Sununu an exitfrom the White House by naming him to a campaign postfocusing on his home state of New Hampshire. If Sununu stays,one potential campaign chairman is George W. Bush, whowouldn't have to worry about direct access to his father.                                                                                                          CLINTON STARTS to break away from the Democraticpresidential pack.   Even rivals concede the Arkansas governor has his messageand appeal together. After his economic plan dazzlesDemocrats all month, Clinton prepares new crime initiativesand his first major foreign-affairs speech. He nears signingJames Carville, the strategist in Sen. Wofford's Pennsylvaniawin, to sharpen his populist edge.   Clinton's staff quietly works for a surprise strongshowing at Florida's state party straw poll, ambushingHarkin. Some experts think he is the candidate bestpositioned to go one-on-one with Cuomo. He expects a majorboost next month: the endorsement of Georgia Sen. Nunn.   But he still struggles to win over working-class NewHampshire Democrats; a poor showing in the first primarycould cripple his chances.                                                                                                          ARMS SALES continue in the Mideast. A possible new NorthKorean shipment of Scud missiles to Syria raises U.S. andIsraeli concern. Arms experts say Syria, using funds fromSaudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Iran, also is shopping forSoviet tanks and bombers. Iran buys Chinese weapons,including missiles, Iranian opposition leaders say.                                                                                                          CONGRESS'S RUSH to recess leads the Senate to skip chancesto grill Fed Chairman Greenspan about the nation's weakeconomy. Preoccupied with other matters, the BankingCommittee never calls him for his semiannual report on theeconomy and puts off until next year hearings on hisnomination for a second term.                                                                                                          THE SUPREME COURT agrees to hear a series of seeminglytechnical cases that could expand constitutional &quot;propertyrights.&quot; The cases involve such issues as landownersrestricted by environmental laws. Justice Scalia has shown aparticular interest in the property-rights issue, as hasanother justice: Clarence Thomas.                                                                                                          ABASHED AUDITORS: Congress's General Accounting Office,which assailed the savings and loan bailout agency for delaysand high costs, recently finished its 1990 audit of theagency -- months late and for $1 million, twice the expectedexpense. It will only charge $750,000, due to &quot;learningcurve&quot; and &quot;on the job training costs.&quot;                                                                                                          U.S. ARABS TARGET loan guarantees for Israel to rallypolitical power.   Arab-American groups try to tap public disdain for foreignaid to fight the proposed $10 billion in U.S. guarantees. Abanner flown over a Cleveland Browns football game for theArab-American Political Caucus read: &quot;Money for USA, notIsrael.&quot; Even if Bush and Congress end up approving someguarantees next year, U.S. Arabs contend they will gainpolitical identity.   The 2.5 million Arab Americans carve out growing politicalstrength in such cities as Chicago, Cleveland, Dearborn,Mich., and San Francisco. There are 32 Arab American mayorsand over 400 candidates running for local offices, says JamesZogby, president of the Arab American Institute. An ArabAmerican in San Diego is a top contender for a newcongressional seat.   Bush meets periodically with Arab Americans, but until arecent meeting such talks weren't on his public calendar.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Tsongas jokes that if Bush takes one moretrip abroad, the president will be able to call himself animmigrant. . . .
