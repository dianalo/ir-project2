Super high-speed light signals transmitted via fiber-opticsystems can transport vast amounts of voice, data andtelevision signals through ultrapure glass fibers thethickness of hair. The industry calls this broadbandtransmission.</LP><TEXT>   But these signals must be converted to comparativelysluggish electronic signals before they can pass through thematrix of electronic gates that form current computerizedexchanges. The challenge is to develop optical switches toeliminate that costly and inefficient conversion and unleashthe full power of fiber-optics.   ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories successfully demonstrated lastJanuary an awkward-looking processor that did numericalcalculations using light beams. Today, ATandamp;T Chairman RobertE. Allen is to tell the company's shareholders at its annualmeeting in Los Angeles that ATandamp;T will begin shippingcommunications products using the new technology in aboutfive years.   Several teams of Bell Labs scientists and engineers havebegun designing prototype telecommunications products, usingas their guide the designs of Alan Huang and his team ofresearchers who developed the ATandamp;T optical processor.   &quot;Every big phone company, including all the Bellcompanies, is betting on broadband transmission in the futureto handle such things as high-definition TV and fax. Andbroadband networks will transmit communications traffic interabits, or trillions of bits per second,&quot; says H. ScottHinton, chief of Bell Labs' photonic switching department.ATandamp;T's flagship electronic digital switch, the 5ESS,currently handles five billion bits per second. &quot;We'll needswitches that are three orders of magnitude more powerfulthan conventional systems,&quot; Mr. Hinton says.   ATandamp;T itself could benefit from using optical switches toaccommodate heavy traffic. ATandamp;T is the world's largestcarrier of long-distance voice and data traffic. And it isadding new traffic-intensive services, including networkmanagement for big corporate customers and financial servicesfor businesses and consumers.   Mr. Hinton acknowledges that Japanese suppliers presentthe biggest long-term threat. NEC Corp. and MitsubishiELECTRIC Co. have already displayed their own prototypes ofoptical processors. And Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. isworking hard on the technology, and could license its designsto its key equipment suppliers, NEC and Fujitsu Ltd.   ATandamp;T's equipment arm, ATandamp;T Network Systems, has beenstruggling to fend off foreign rivals in the market forhighly complex switching systems used to route telephonetraffic. Furthermore, orders for these switching systems aretapering off and profits from them are razor thin, so ATandamp;T'srivals -- chiefly Japan's NEC and Fujitsu, Canada's NorthernTelecom Ltd. and France's Alcatel N.V. -- are focusing on themarket for the transmission equipment that pumps phonetraffic.   In just five years, NEC and Fujitsu have built animpressive base in the U.S. fiber-optic transmissionequipment market, capturing a combined 16% vs. ATandamp;T's 52%,Rockwell International Corp.'s 21% and Northern Telecom's 6%,according to Northern Business Information/Datapro, a marketresearch firm based in New York.   A dogfight has already broken out over a new group offiber-optic products built to a new industry standard calledSonet, or Synchronous Optical Network. Developed by BellCommunications Research and the world's telecommunicationsauthorities, the Sonet industry standard is expected toexpand the base of transmission equipment suppliers, thusincreasing competition. Sonet should also allow the phonecompanies to improve maintenance and boost profits by weedingout inefficient systems that need a lot of expensive gear tohelp them communicate.   This battle is expected to produce a huge market as phonecompanies accelerate their installation plans. From next tonothing today, the Sonet business will hit $250 million by1994 and quadruple that by 1997, predicts Michael Miller, ananalyst at Northern Business Information/Datapro. After 2000,the sky could be the limit as the phone companies begin totransform all of their networks -- down to the last mile tohome and office -- to Sonet systems.   &quot;Under the Sonet concept, control is no longer centralizedin the switch, but decentralized so that the user, whichcould be the phone company or a big corporate network center,has more control over their communications transmission,&quot;says Eli Noam, a commissioner with New York's Public ServiceCommission and founding director of Columbia University'sCenter for Telecommunications and Information Studies.   None of these Sonet-based systems will work to fullpotential until engineers develop optical exchanges with thecapacity to handle the enormous amounts of traffic generatedby photonic transmission systems.   ATandamp;T is off to a good start. Bell Labs engineers made twosignificant breakthroughs in the last few months on opticaltechnology. In December, ATandamp;T announced that its scientistshad developed a combined photonic and electronic integratedcircuit to process information. The gallium-arsenide chipcontains 2,048 devices called S-SEEDs, or symmetric selfelectro-optic effect devices, and works something like anelectronic transistor. This means that light beams can beswitched on and off -- the manner in which computerscommunicate and do calculations -- in less than one billionthof a second.   Moreover, on April 11 ATandamp;T announced at a computersymposium in Kobe, Japan, that its scientists had built aconnecting device for linking integrated circuits in anoptical network. The modules contain surface-emitting lasers,lenses and mirrors in a sandwich-like quartz chip that isone-eighth of an inch thick and one inch in diameter. Ineffect, these devices should enable Bell labs scientists toshrink Mr. Huang's crude-looking optical processor and beginimplementing the design in ATandamp;T's future switches.   The first of these systems will be introduced in 1995, sayindividuals familiar with ATandamp;T's plans. The system, called adigital access cross-connect, or DACCS, is a transmissionsystem that actually works as a switch to transfer trafficfrom one high-speed trunk line to another and convert thetraffic to lower speed electronic signals that can be handledby the central office switch. With an optical DACCS, phonecompanies will be able to switch broadband traffic and sendit to the home or office. After 1995, these individuals say,ATandamp;T will insert an optical switch into its flagshipelectronic exchange, the 5ESS, turning the local switchingoffice in phone networks into an exchange with severalthousand times the capacity of today's switches.   Where these optical systems will first find their way intothe nation's phone system is unknown, but ATandamp;T insiders sayATandamp;T itself will likely test the systems in its ownlong-distance network within three years before offering themto the Bell companies.   ---                 Fiber Optic Players                                                                                                          Shares of the fiber optic transmission equipment marketworth $795 million in 1989                                                                                                                   ATandamp;T            52.0%            Rockwell        21.0%            NEC             12.0%            No. Telecom      6.0%            Fujitsu          4.0%            Telco Systems    4.0%            Alcatel          0.5%            Siemens          0.5%                                                                                                          Source: Northern Business Information</TEXT></DOC>
