(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man has sued a prestigious prep school,saying his son's education extended to drugs and alcohol with theschool's knowledge.   Dr. Manuel C. Palao alleges in a lawsuit filed in federal courtin Trenton that his 13-year-old son Michael became addicted to drugsand alcohol at Lawrenceville School.   Palao charges that officials knew of and condoned drug andalcohol use by youths at the boarding school that was established in1810 and has turned out such alumni as publisher Malcolm Forbes Sr.and rock 'n' roll star Huey Lewis.   At the end of each semester, housemasters responsible for theyouth's dormitory would pass out containers to collect contraband``as a form of general amnesty,'' the lawsuit charges.   ``The contraband collected would generally fill a large plastictrash bag,'' the lawsuit alleges.   Officials at the Lawrenceville School said they had not seen thelawsuit and were not prepared to comment on it, according to DorothySilvestri, secretary to Associate Headmaster Anthony Wilson.   Palao of Bethlehem, Pa., enrolled his son in September 1985 atthe school, which is about 10 miles north of Trenton. He removedMichael from the school in 1988 after learning he had becomeaddicted to drugs and alcohol, his lawyer, Michael J. Perrucci, saidThursday.   Perrucci said the boy began using marijuana and alcohol duringhis first year. Since leaving the school he has undergone drugrehabilitation at a cost of $32,304, the lawyer said.   The lawsuit names the school and four top educators.   Perrucci said his client wants to be reimbursed for the drugcounseling and $33,739 in tuition paid over three years.   The lawsuit also seeks personal damages for the boy's mentalanguish, loss of reputation and damages for two lost years of incomeas a result of the interruption of his schooling, the lawyer said.</TEXT></DOC>
