On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit remanded that part of this proceedingand directed the Commission to reconsider its decision. In response, theCommission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to amend itsrules to place ROI-Equipment back in the avoidable cost category, 53 FR47559, November 23, 1988. Comments were filed and have been considered.The Commission now adopts as final rules those proposed changes. In addition,some minor errors in the abandonment regulations are corrected and therules have been modified to require that ROI-Equipment be shown separatelyunder both the on-branch and off-branch cost categories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>The revised rules are effective on May 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Joseph H.
