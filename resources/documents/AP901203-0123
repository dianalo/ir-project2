ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Holiday giftgivers should avoid buying toys,cosmetics and ornaments that come wrapped in excessive plastic andcardboard, an environmental coalition said Monday.   The third set of ``Wastemaker'' awards handed out by Rep. FrankPallone Jr., D-N.J., and the Wastewatch coalition of environmentalgroups was meant to encourage shoppers to think environmentally.   ``As with all Wastemaker products, it is the consumer and thetaxpayer who pay the price,'' Pallone said. He said specialpackaging costs more at purchase time and increases taxes for solidwaste disposal.   U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Clean Water Actionjoined Pallone and Environmental Action at a news conference tocite nine products that should be avoided.   The products, purchased in the last three weeks at Washingtonarea stores, include:   - Tiny model cars called ``Matchbox Super Color Changers'' madeby a New Jersey toymaker. According to Wastewatch, they arepackaged in form-fitting plastic, glued to a cardboard display cardaccompanied by a small sponge and disposable plastic tub for colorchanges.   ``The product that's been cited is not in the line and hasn'tbeen for the last year,'' said Michele Litzky, spokeswoman forMatchbox Toys USA Ltd., of Moonachie, N.J.   - A trophy figure and a scorecard for the popular Nintendo videogame. The accessory was cited for an oversized cardboard packageand plastic window.   ``It's a little surprising they selected a product that hasn'tbeen sold since 1988,'' said Wayne Charness, vice president ofHasbro, Inc., in Pawtucket, R.I. He said 90 percent of Hasbro'spackaging is recycled fiber and the company has been increasing itsuse of recycled materials.   - Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s four trumpet-shaped Christmasornaments enclosed in a heavy plastic tray, cardboard box and clearplastic lid. Wastewatch said Sears offered a round tree ornamentpackaged in environmentally preferable recyclable cardboard.   ``Our first concern is that the product is packaged so that whenthe customer opens it at home, the product is not broken, dented,bent or scratched,'' said Gordon Jones, a spokesman for the Chicagoretailer.   However, he said the company was working with suppliers todevelop environmentally sound packages and had eliminated plasticfoam from many of its holiday light sets.   - A Drakkar Noir cosmetics gift set, a product of Cosmair Inc.Two small bottles are encased in a heavy cardboard box with plasticinserts. Cecilia Noguera, a spokeswoman for Cosmair's fragrancedivision in New York City, declined to comment.   Other products cited were Saranac football gloves made by theSaranac Glove Co. in Green Bay, Wis.; Smooshees Smugglers hairaccessories from Fisher Price in East Aurora, N.Y.; HolidayEnchantment cassette tape set from Moose Records, Tapes and CDs inSan Francisco; Calvin Klein ``Obsession'' gift set from CalvinKlein Cosmetics Corp. in New York City; and Carlton Cards wrap andtrim ensemble from American Greetings Corp. of Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
