The weekly is widely read by Chinese intellectuals and students.The city forced it to stop distribution of its April 24 edition andremove articles it said were likely to cause ``disturbances.''   Liu Ji, a senior propaganda official, replaced Qin after Qinrefused to comply, saying it would constitute undue officialcontrol of the press, the sources said.   The original issue carried six pages of articles and speecheshonoring the late Hu Yaobang, said an editor at the newspaper'sBeijing bureau.   ``The items the government said were likely to causedisturbances have been taken out,'' he said.   The excised articles apparently asked the party to revise itsassessment of Hu, who was ousted as Communist Party chief afterfailing to crack down on student demonstrations in 1986-87.   Hu's death on April 15 touched off major protests by studentsdemanding democratic reforms.   Journalists at several major dailies have shown support for theHerald.   China's state-controlled press has moved gradually towardindependence in its reporting on economic policies and news, butcriticism of senior leaders, questioning Communist one-party ruleor delving into sensitive subjects such as unrest in Tibet areoff-limits.</TEXT></DOC>
