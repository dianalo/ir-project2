But nowhere has the perversion of language been more prevalent or taken on more of an Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass quality than in debate involving the federal budget. The professed difficulty in meeting the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law's deficit target is a perfect example.    The dominant theme of the budget debate for fiscal 1988 has been the supposed impossibility of making the dramatic reductions in federal spending required to cut the deficit to $108 billion from $174 billion. An army of &quot;experts&quot; tells us this herculean task requires either tax increases or draconian cuts in vital federal programs. Yet in all the rhetoric the debate has generated, it is never mentioned that in a moderately healthy economy, neither a tax increase nor reduced total federal spending is required to meet the Gramm-Rudman reduction targets and achieve a balanced budget by fiscal 1991.    The apparent contradiction in meeting the targets while avoiding both tax boosts and a spending cut is easily resolved by recognizing that the government is a principal beneficiary of economic growth. That fact has been missing from the entire debate. Without any increase in tax rates, a moderate level of economic growth generates about $70 billion of additional federal revenues a year.    This revenue gain exceeds the deficit-reduction requirement for fiscal 1988 and is almost twice as large as the reduction required in subsequent years.    The table analyzes the budget in the context of economic growth. The top part shows the 1987 fiscal budget in terms of how the projected revenue growth ($73.2 billion, based on estimates by the Office of Management and Budget of a 3.1% growth rate in the gross national product) is being spent. The largest deficit reduction in American history is occurring while spending is growing by $27 billion. The deficit falls sharply because revenues are growing 10% while aggregate spending is growing only 3%.    It is doubtful that one person in a thousand understands that in the federal budget debate, as it is portrayed daily in the press, &quot;cuts&quot; refer to reductions in what would have been spent, not reductions from last year's actual spending levels. In this context a smaller increase is transformed into a cut.    Evidence of this misunderstanding is widespread: In the past few weeks, probably most U.S. newspapers have run at least one big story reporting the large spending cuts in Mr. Reagan's proposed 1988 budget. Yet under that proposal, total outlays rise $7.5 billion.    The bottom part of the table shows the 1988 budget proposal in the context of how the president intends using the about $74 billion in projected revenue growth (based on OMB estimates of a 3.5% GNP growth rate) -- $68 billion coming as the federal share of projected economic growth under existing tax rates and $6.1 billion coming from trust-fund reforms, user fees and changes in collection procedures. Net interest costs are projected to rise $2.4 billion over the 1987 level and Social Security spending is to rise $11.5 billion due to increased eligibility and to cost-of-living increases. Mr. Reagan proposes a $15.4 billion boost in defense spending, $14.1 billion in asset and loan sales and user fees as expenditure offsets, and a $7.7 billion actual reduction in non-defense outlays. Total spending is to rise $7.5 billion and the deficit is to be reduced almost $67 billion, meeting the $108 billion deficit target.    Simple arithmetic will demonstrate that even with a modest economic growth rate, revenues will grow fast enough to exceed the deficit reduction required each year until fiscal 1991. In fact, an average annual revenue growth of only $70 billion through fiscal 1991 would generate a $100 billion surplus in 1991 if total spending were frozen at the existing level. Over the remaining four years, balancing the budget simply requires that two out of every three dollars of expected revenue growth be applied to reduce the deficit.    Two factors combine to make it difficult to limit the growth of federal spending. First, the government has had a 10% average annual growth in outlays for 20 years. Politicians and those they serve are not accustomed, therefore, to making hard choices or setting priorities. Second, growth in some individual programs is unavoidable. Increases in interest payments on the public debt and for Social Security, for instance, are required by contractual obligations. Programs such as Medicare contain built-in growth that must be controlled or offset through spending cuts in other federal programs.    However, when all things are taken into consideration -- whether or not you believe the Reagan defense proposal is too high and that funds should be transferred out of defense and into non-defense -- the actual sacrifice in fiscal terms called for in the Reagan budget is quite modest. This conclusion is amplified when it is recognized that Congress chose to make the fiscal 1988 deficit target more difficult to reach when it employed phony as well as non-recurring savings in this year's budget. If the fiscal 1987 target had been met by making permanent changes in policy, spending could have grown by 4% in fiscal 1988 while meeting the 1988 target.    Suppose working families were asked if they support meeting the deficit-reduction targets by holding next year's expenditures to roughly this year's level. I suspect few of them would say that instead, Congress should be allowed to renege on its commitment to balance the budget or be permitted to raise taxes to avoid placing limits on the growth of federal spending. While we might debate how the public would react to a proposal to increase defense spending 5% while cutting non-defense spending less than 2% to pay for it, the modesty of this proposal is hardly reflected in the exaggerated rhetoric of the current budget debate.    The American people are contributing $74 billion toward meeting the Gramm-Rudman target by sharing the growing fruits of their labor with the federal government. To meet the targets, Congress simply has to hold spending next year at about the same level as this year. Only because the government has prostituted the language to turn limits on spending growth into &quot;cuts&quot; is there any serious debate about the achievability of the target or the necessity of a tax increase.    ---   Mr. Gramm is a Republican senator from Texas.    ---            Application of Revenue Increases                 (In billions of dollars)                          Fiscal 1987        Fiscal 1988                                        (Reagan proposal) Revenue increase              +$73.2             +$74.2 Net Interest                  + $0.6             + $2.4 Social Security               + $9.1             +$11.5 Defense                       + $8.8             +$15.4 Non-Defense Asset Sales/ Offsetting Receipts           - $9.1             -$14.1 Non-Defense Outlays Increase              +$17.6             - $7.7 Total Outlays Increase        +$27.0             + $7.5 Deficit Reduction             +$46.2             +$66.7 Source: Office of Management and Budget</TEXT></DOC>
