The three birds made up nearly 2 percent of the entirepopulation of their kind.   ``Flying whooping cranes at 9 o'clock,'' Capt. Harry Sloat toldthe 80 passengers, his second tour group of the day on the GulfIntracoastal Waterway. ``They're showing off their wing tips foryou.''   Each year, it gets a little easier to spot the birds at theAransas National Wildlife Refuge, which is celebrating its 50thaniversary.   There are about 195 whoopers in the world today; in 1941, thepopulation had dwindled to 15. The decline came as habitats weredeveloped for farms and cities, while hunters helped to nearlyfinish off the species.   Whooping cranes made Aransas famous, but when Congress createdthe coastal preserve in 1937, the legislation did not mention thebird known scientifically as Grus americana.   ``This refuge was not established to protect whooping cranes,''said refuge biologist Tom Stehn. ``It was established to protectwaterfowl habitat.''   The government saw the need to protect less spectacular gamebirds, such as ducks and geese. Whooping cranes just happened to belucky enough to share the same area during the winter.   Their precarious situation by 1945 prompted the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service and National Audubon Society to work on rescuingthe birds from extinction.   ``Without the Aransas refuge, I think it's pretty evident thewhooping crane would have become extinct,'' Stehn said, whileobserving an unusual gathering of 14 whoopers in the same field.   He called it ``just phenomenal to be able to see that manywhooping cranes from one location, to think that at one point therewere only 15 in the entire flock.''   Scientists don't think the whooping crane population everexceeded 5,000, he said.   Only about 8,000 acres on the refuge provide the marshy winterhabitat whooping cranes use to look for food including plants,clams, snakes, crabs, snails, fish, worms and insects.   Several other endangered species make the refuge their home.They include the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon,Attwater's prairie chicken, jaguarundi and Eskimo curlew.   The Texas whooping crane flock numbers 132 this year, a 79percent increase in four years. Virtually all are on or near the54,829-acre refuge.   They migrate each winter to Texas from Canada's Wood BuffaloNational Park 2,400 miles away.   Eighteen to 20 whoopers live among sandhill cranes that migratebetween Gray's Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho and NewMexico's Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They wereintroduced as chicks into the sandhill families, but none havestarted breeding.   A third group of 41 lives in captivity at the Fish and WildlifeService's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Lonespecimens of whooping crane also live at the San Antonio Zoo andthe International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.   With their population steadily growing, the Texas whoopers havestarted spreading to a 44,000-acre state park and refuge on nearbyMatagorda Island. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is buying anadditional 11,502 acres at the southern end of Matagorda from TheNature Conservancy. That will add important new habitat as theterritorial whooping cranes spread out.   ``We're really encouraged by the land that they're adding''because wildlife is rapidly losing ground, said Jesse Grantham,biologist and manager for the National Audubon Society's Texassanctuaries. ``We're not creating habitat. We're just saving littlepieces of what's left.''   Whooper pairs, mated for life, stake out winter territories andreturn to the same claims each year.   The birds stand nearly 5 feet tall and have wings spanning about7{ feet. Adults are snowy white, with black wingtips and red crownson their heads. Immature whooping cranes are rusty red and whitewith black wing tips. Males breed at about the age 3, while femaleswait until they're about 5.   In Rockport, where Sloat's Lucky Day and four other whoopingcrane tour boats are based, the endangered bird means money for thelocal economy.   Just a couple of years ago, only two whooping crane boats wereoperating.   ``You have people that are staying in motels and eating andseeing other things while they are here'' to see the whoopingcranes, said Bob Lynch, executive vice president of theRockport-Fulton Chamber of Commerce. ``It has an economic impact onour community, there's no doubt.''   Some estimate the refuge brings up to $5 million to the localeconomy.   Refuge officials, however, worry about its location on the GulfIntracoastal Waterway, a man-made channel that cuts right throughthe whooping crane habitat.   Some 1,485 acres of habitat have been lost since 1941 due toconstruction of the canal and erosion caused by boat wakes.   Regular barge traffic leaves oil, grease, cadmium, arsenic,nickel and mercury, while many of the barges carry deadly cargo.   ``There is some nasty stuff going through that canal,'' saidrefuge manager Brent Giezentanner. ``You're carrying very toxicchemicals within 100 yards of the cranes. If we have one bargebreak open some time, we potentially could have a major portion ofthe whooping crane habitat contaminated.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, March 21</NOTE></DOC>
