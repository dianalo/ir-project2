FDIC Chairman William Seidman refused to elaborate on the comments, made in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. He told reporters only that &quot;there are one or two major institutions we're following.&quot;    In the committee hearing, Mr. Seidman had been asked whether any other U.S. banks are expected to fail in the next six months. &quot;We do not see any major banks beyond maybe one, or perhaps two, that we might have a problem with,&quot; he said. He added that he couldn't identify any major failure candidates &quot;for sure.&quot;    On July 29, Mr. Seidman announced a rescue of First RepublicBank of Texas that will cost the FDIC an initial $4 billion, although the agency could recoup $1 billion to $2 billion of that. In his Senate testimony, he said he didn't expect any comparable failures next year. </TEXT></DOC>
