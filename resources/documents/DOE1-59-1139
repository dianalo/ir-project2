A highly immunogenic surface angigen called thecircumsporozoite (CS) protein covers the sporozoite form of all Plasmodiumspecies examined including Plasmodium falciparum, the major malaria ofman. Protective species examined generated in both the rodent and primatemodel systems are against this protein, thus directing the focus fora synthetic or recombinant-produced sporozoite vaccine to the structuralfeatures of this protein. The structure of this gene and the deducedamino acid sequence for the CS protein of the monkey malaria, Plasmodiumknowlesi, were determined first because of the availability of largenumbers of sporozoites for preparation of a cDNA library. Protectiveantibodies bound to a repeating amino acid sequence (12 amino acids repeated12 times), which comprised 40% of the mass of the protein (Ozaki et al.1983). Recently, we have cloned the gene for the CS protein of P. falciparumusing a new cloning technique, determined its nucleotide sequence, anddeduced the amino acid sequence of the protein from the nucleotide sequence.The repeating segment of the protein and two other previously unidentifiedregions are highlighted here as having potential for use in preparinga vaccine.</TEXT></DOC>
