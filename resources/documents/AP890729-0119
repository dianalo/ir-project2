This was no ordinary photography exhibit: It was a record,albeit partial, of the biggest protests in Communist China, andmany of the viewers took part.   ``Look, I know him,'' one young girl whispered to a friend asthey studied a photograph of student leaders addressing a crowdduring the pro-democracy movement that is now officially condemnedas an anti-socialist rebellion.   The girl looked quickly around to see if anyone heard. But noone seemed to be paying attention; everyone had their ownassociations connected with the seven weeks of marches and sit-insthat ended June 3-4 when the army attacked. Hundreds and possiblythousands of people died.   The three-room exhibit at the China Art Museum that openedFriday afternoon was the latest in a series of official efforts toconvince the public that the army acted correctly.   Government books and television programs have given the officialversion of the events. The Military Museum of the Chinese People'sRevolution has put tanks burned by protesters on display in itsfront courtyard, along with several burned public buses used asstreet barricades against the army's advance.   The dramatic exhibit included pictures of soldiers recapturingTiananmen Square, where the students made their headquarters duringthe protests.   Many pictures were shown for the first time in public. No photocredits were given, but they clearly were the work of military orpolice photographers with special access.   There were huge aerial shots of Beijing streets filled withbanner-waving marchers, of the student tent city in TiananmenSquare, of lone soldiers guarding the square at sunrise. There weresoldiers with cracked skulls and bloodied clothing, and soldiers'bodies on fire and the charred remains.   The exhibit did not contain any pictures of civilians wounded orkilled. Western journalists shot dozens of pictures of studentscarrying their wounded on their backs or on pedicabs.   The official purpose of the display may have been education, butmany viewers went to remember and search for clues to reallyhappened in Tiananmen Square.   ``That's Chai Ling, that's Guo Haifeng, there's Ma Shaofang,'' awell-groomed woman said to a friend, referring to student leaderswho are now fugitives or under arrest. Only Ma was identified inthe picture.   ``Look at how the soldiers came in here,'' a youth said, placinghis finger on a mass of green-uniformed figures trying to push itsway through a civilian crowd. ``They couldn't go forward or back,that's when they used the tear gas.''   Some viewers broke into smiles or laughs upon seeing again themarchers' banners: ``Step down, Li Peng. Retire, Deng Xiaoping.''Hoisting such slogans now against the premier and senior leaderwould mean certain arrest.   One young man pressed his face within inches of a dark,smoke-hazed view of soldiers moving into Tiananmen, trying in vainto make out whether students remained on the vast expanse.   Many Chinese now discount rumors, circulated immediately afterthe army attack, of thousands of deaths in the square and of thearmy burning bodies, but few believe the government account thatall the students left the square first and that no one was killedthere.   The government has acknowledged that more than 200 civiliansdied, including some innocent bystanders. Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence reports say that up to 3,000 people may havebeen killed.</TEXT></DOC>
