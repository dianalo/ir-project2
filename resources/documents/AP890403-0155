(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven states will gain at least $135million as a result of a Supreme Court ruling Monday that upholds atax on oil company profits, officials said.   The high court, by an 8-0 vote, upheld a New Jersey tax that 13major oil companies said unfairly had cost them tens of millions ofdollars.   The court said New Jersey officials lawfully refused to allowstate tax deductions for what the oil companies paid in federalwindfall profit taxes.   The ruling also applied to six other states that refused toallow such deductions.   Lawyers for the oil industry, mining interests and natural gasproducers had contended that a New Jersey victory in the nation'shighest court could encourage other states to adopt similar taxsystems.   Writing for the court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the statetax does not unduly interfere with interstate commerce.   The ruling was lauded by state officials and criticized by oilcompany representatives.   The outcome of the case was of particular interest in NewJersey, which included an anticipated $98 million windfall from theoil companies as revenues in its tight state budget for next year.   Georgia stands to gain at least $25 million from oil companiesas a result of the ruling, said Marcus Collins, commissioner of thestate department of revenue.   South Carolina officials said the ruling means the state won'thave to pay out an estimated $10 million in refunds to the oilcompanies.   In Minnesota, the state will get at least $2.2 million from oilcompanies, officials said.   Officials from the other states affected by the ruling _ NewYork, Iowa, and Wisconsin _ said they did not know Monday how muchmoney will be coming in because of the ruling.   The federal windfall profits tax was imposed on oil retrievalafter President Carter announced he would gradually remove controlson domestic crude oil prices beginning in mid-1979.   The windfall profits tax allowed the federal government torecover billions of dollars in increased profits the oil companiesrealized by the jump in oil prices resulting from decontrol.   The windfall tax, which yielded more than $78 billion in federalrevenue, was repealed by Congress last year but there may be somecompanies still paying on past earnings.   New Jersey's corporate business tax imposes a levy on a portionof the ``entire net income'' of a corporation that does business inthe state.   Under the state tax formula, a corporation's net income is thesame as its federal taxable income ``before net operating lossdeduction and special deductions.''   The state tax law also includes an ``add-back'' provision thatsays ``entire net income shall be determined without the exclusion,deduction or credit of ... taxes paid or accrued to the UnitedStates on or measured by profit or income.''   The oil companies sought to avoid ``adding back'' the amount oftheir federal windfall profit taxes _ in effect claiming adeduction for that tax from its ``entire net income.'' New Jerseyauthorities disallowed such a deduction.   ``We conclude that the add-back provision does not discriminateagainst interstate commerce,'' Blackmun said.   ``We're disappointed with the ruling,'' said James Benton,executive director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council. ``Webelieved that a state such as New Jersey, which has no oilproduction, could not impose such a corporate business tax.''   Benton said oil companies will promptly pay the balance owed NewJersey.   The companies that challenged the tax are Amerada Hess Corp.,Atlantic Richfield Co., Conoco Inc., Citgo Petroleum Corp., ExxonCorp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp., UnocalCorp., Gulf (a division of Chevron), Shell Oil Co., Tenneco Inc.and Texaco Inc.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the case forunannounced reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
