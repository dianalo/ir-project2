He and his mother, Norma, spent Monday night in a pew at theUnited Methodist Church here.   ``These are the loveliest people,'' Mrs. Rohrbach said.   In less than 12 hours, at least 450 stranded motorists pouredinto Valley View, located about 60 miles north of Dallas, to escapenearly a foot of ice piled on the highway. They packed homes, allfour churches and the high school gymnasium before spilling out intothe town square and nearly every side street to huddle in theirparked rigs and trailers.   Many of the town's 575 residents offered cots and blankets,donuts and milk or heartier fare. They opened their homes, venturedonto a treacherous highway to rescue the stranded, then stayed upall night to see them fed and sheltered.   ``Most of these people pass by here all the time and now ValleyView will hold some special memories for them,'' said MelodieeBlevins, who helped house and feed 125 storm-weary travelers at theFirst Baptist Church, where her husband, Jeff, is pastor.   ``I don't think they'll forget us,'' she said.   Elsewhere in the nation, others were not so fortunate. Thirtypeople have died since the weekend as the huge storm cut a swathfrom Oklahoma through Missouri, leaving up to 16 inches of snowbefore blowing across the Eastern Seaboard into the ocean.   Storm warnings have been issued on the North Carolina coastalwaters south of Virginia Beach, and 1 to 2 inches of rain floodedseveral roads. Residents of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, kept a wary eyeon the rain-swollen Monongahela River.   In Arkansas, Gov. Bill Clinton asked federal officials for adisaster declaration for four northwest Arkansas counties after snowand ice crushed 280 poultry houses, leaving up to $35 million indamage and dead birds.   In all, the storm destroyed as many as 700 poultry houses in afour-state area, causing what could be the single biggest disasterever to hit the poultry industry, said Lynch Butler, president ofSimmons Industries Inc., of Siloam Springs, Ark. Poultry operationsin Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas also were hit hard.   As it moved east, the storm knocked out electricity temporarilyto 40,000 customers in Maryland and Delaware, and thousands more inOhio and Pennsylvania.   In Valley View, however, the worst was over today, although anicy slush on Interstate 35 continued to cause traffic slowdowns nearthe Texas-Oklahoma border.   ``It's kind of a let down after Monday night,'' Ms. Blevins said.``It added a lot of excitement to a small town.''</TEXT></DOC>
