John C. Danforth, R-Mo., saidThursday after the proposed amendment failed in the Senate.   Opponents of the measure said Americans are having secondthoughts about the notion of changing the Constitution.   White House lobbying appeared minimal despite a strong publiccampaign that last summer took President Bush to the foot of theIwo Jima Memorial.   The measure did win a bare majority in the Senate, 51-48, butfell 15 votes short of the required two-thirds of senators presentand voting.   Eleven Republicans joined 37 Democrats to oppose the measure.Thirty-three Republicans and 18 Democrats voted for the proposal,which would have authorized the state and federal governments tooutlaw flag desecration.   Following the vote, White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Bushwas ``disappointed'' and believes such an amendment represents``the only ... real protection for the flag.'' She said a bill sentto the president last week to ban flag-burning by statute ``wouldnot survive constitutional scrutiny.''   Critics of the amendment, in contrast, said the bill wouldsatisfy concern in the country about flag-burning.   ``I think when the statute passed, it made it much easier tofocus on the Constitution,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.``But this amendment should fall anyway because of the danger itposes to the Bill of Rights.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a strong supporter of theamendment, told reporters that ``the public was confused on this.''   ``They were led to believe a statute would do the job andproduce results,'' he said. ``Now we don't know what we've got ifanything.''   Supporters of the amendment claimed it was the only sure way toprevent a recurrence of the Supreme Court decision in June thatoverturned the conviction of Texas flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnsonon grounds his right to free speech was violated.   ``We all lose with this action,'' said Miles Eplin, nationalcommander of the American Legion, after the vote. ``Today, I feellike my friends have been let down, as well as those from othergenerations who died believing that our nation would alwaysremember their sacrifices and respect the foremost symbol of allthey held dear.''   Critics said there would be a political price to pay at electiontime for opposing the measure. At the same time, though, theyseemed increasingly emboldened to attack the amendment as a threatto the Constitution.   ``We face no sudden or uncontrollable burst of flagdestruction,'' Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,declared. ``...Yet we are being asked to believe that the flagwhich neither Hitler nor Stalin could defeat is now threatened by asingle misguided person who most Americans never heard of and don'tcare about.''   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., took the Senate floor onThursday morning to make one last appeal for approval of themeasure. He painted a colorful panorama of flag history from IwoJima to the lunar landing and said the Senate was too bogged downin technicalities.   ``The need for this amendment will not be found in a textbook ora treatise on constitutional law,'' Dole said. ``No, it will befound in the emotions of the heart, emotions deeply rooted in thereal-life experiences of millions of Americans, and emotions thatare crying out today to give the flag real and lasting protection.''   Afterward, Dole said: ``I think the flag should be flown athalf-staff after this vote.''   Danforth and Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., initially co-sponsoredthe proposal, but both did an about-face on Tuesday and becameopponents.   ``When I was originally asked to support it, I thought, I wantto protect the flag,'' Danforth said. ``... But as the vote gotcloser and as I started reflecting on it and getting more seriousabout it, my opinion became one of the greatest reluctance tochange the Constitution.''</TEXT></DOC>
