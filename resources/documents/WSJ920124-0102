And just about everyone inAmerica waits with great expectation for the president tospeak the words that will bring these costs under control.All this misses a crucial point. Employers and unions couldeliminate the most powerful force driving up health-carecosts without government action. The key is price competitionamong providers for employees' health-care business.   Many employers still offer their employees onlytraditional coverage: fee-for-service, third-party paymentswith free choice of doctor and hospital. Free choice soundsgood, but it deprives the payer of any bargaining power overprices or quality. Fee-for-service pays doctors and hospitalsmore for doing more whether or not more is necessary. Itshouldn't be surprising that there is a lot of unnecessarysurgery.</LP><TEXT>   The traditional fee-for-service, free-choice system reliesonly on government and patients to control quality. Butgovernment is incapable of picking good doctors and removingbad ones. And individual patients don't have the informationor the expertise to judge quality of care. They needcompetent, private-sector purchasing agents armed with dataon the experience of many patients to select doctors andhospitals for them. This is what &quot;managed care&quot; is all about,the most commonplace being health maintenance organizations(HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs).   Most large employers now offer their employees the choiceof joining one or more HMOs and/or PPOs, as well astraditional fee-for-service coverage. It is well documentedthat some HMOs can provide high-quality care forsubstantially less cost than traditional fee-for-service. Butthe way most employers structure the choice deprives theemployee who selects the low-priced alternative of all ormost of the savings. The employee has no incentive to choosethe low-priced plan. This, in turn, deprives the HMO of theincentive to be the low-priced plan. These employer policiesamount to a large subsidy to the wasteful traditionalfee-for-service system and a bias against cost-effectiveHMOs.   A few examples will illustrate this point.   -- In 1989 a Detroit auto company offered workers a choicebetween traditional fee-for-service Blue Cross/Blue Shieldcosting $458 a month and the Health Alliance Plan HMO,costing $357. The deal between company and union was that thecompany would pay the whole premium whichever plan theemployee chose. In other words, Health Alliance Plan got noreward for being the low-cost plan.   -- In the Twin Cities, where several HMOs have competedsince the early 1970s, major employers have followed the sameinflationary policy. They pay the full price of anything upto the price of fee-for-service. Not surprisingly, the HMOshave raised their prices to levels close to those offee-for-service. The employers complain about this practiceand call it &quot;shadow pricing.&quot;   -- The state of New York pays 90% of the premium ofwhichever plan a state employee chooses. In the case of asingle employee, if he chooses traditional Blue Cross/BlueShield at $150 a month, the state contributes $135. If hechooses Health Insurance Plan (HIP), an HMO, at $100 a month,the state contributes $90. The state pockets the $45difference between the two premiums.   -- In 1990, Citibank's fee-for-service coverage cost $164a month. Citibank contributed $139 and the employee paid $25.Citibank employees also had the option of choosing HIP.Citibank paid all of HIP's $100 monthly premium and pocketedthe $39 a month difference.   -- In California in 1990-91 state employees had a choiceof several plans, including PERS Care, a fee-for-service planadministered by Blue Shield, at a cost of $204 a month, andKaiser Permanente of Northern California, the state's largestHMO, with a cost of $128 a month. By law, the state paid thepremium up to a fixed-dollar amount of $157. (This was equalto the average of the premiums of the four largestparticipating health plans.) For every employee who chose the$128 Kaiser premium, then, the state pocketed $29 per month.   This is a formula for an unending inflationary spiral.With employer behavior like that, we don't need anotherexplanation for health-care inflation. Put another way, ineach of the cases I've outlined, the more efficient HMO wasdeprived of any reward in the marketplace for holding itspremiums down.   Why do employers persist in such inflationary policies?The answer is partly historical. Back in the 1950s and '60s,when health-care costs were much lower and HMOs were rare,employers became used to the idea that they would pay thefull premium of fee-for-service plans. These decisions werereinforced by unions, which demanded &quot;employer-pay-all&quot;health plans as a tradeoff for smaller wage increases, and bythe Internal Revenue Code, which doesn't tax employees on thehealth-care benefits they receive.   What is the alternative? The rational economic answer isinformed, cost-conscious consumer choice. Let the employerselect a menu of high-quality managed care plans and offeremployees a fixed-dollar amount that does not exceed theprice of the lowest-priced plan. Employees who choose planswith premiums higher than that of the lowest-priced planwould pay the difference themselves, preferably withafter-tax dollars. This would give employees an incentive tochoose the lowest-priced plan. In turn, it would give eachmanaged care plan the incentive to be the lowest-priced planin a bid to attract more customers.   Why don't employers adopt this apparently rational policy?The answer is illustrated by what is happening at Stanford,where I work, and in Sacramento.   At Stanford, we offer employees a choice among three HMOsand a preferred provider insurance plan. (Traditionalfree-choice, fee-for-service priced itself out of our marketseveral years ago.) Through 1991, for purchasers ofindividual coverage, we had an employer-contribution formulathat amounted to &quot;employer pay all,&quot; whatever plan theemployee chose (with a few exceptions). (Purchasers ofdependent coverage have always made cost-conscious choices.)In November, in response to the need for cost reductions, theuniversity announced that in 1992, purchasers of individualcoverage would have to contribute at least $25 per month, nomatter what plan they chose. More significant, their monthlyout-of-pocket contribution would be even higher if they chosea plan that costs more than the least expensive. The changewas very unpopular with many employees.   State employees are facing a similar situation. Lastsummer, as a result of the state's budget crisis, the lawmandating the state's employer contributions was repealed,and the state froze the dollar amounts it would contribute in1991-92 at the 1990-91 level. This greatly increased employeecost-consciousness. It also led some health plans to cuttheir prices (yes, the market works).   The actions of Stanford and the state of California alonearen't enough to keep down the cost of health care in thelong run. If Stanford and the state hang tough, but otheremployers do not follow suit, the health-care system willcontinue to be driven by the inflationary incentives in the&quot;employer pay all&quot; policies. For this system to work, acritical mass of employers must make the suppliers compete onprice.   How can this be achieved?   -- A limit on the tax-free employer contributions tohealth benefits would be helpful. That won't be feasiblepolitically until there is widespread understanding of theneed for cost-conscious choice.   -- Union leaders must understand and educate their membersthat what the employer pays in health care is money thatcannot be paid in wages or jobs. Blank checks to the healthservices industry are not a good use of employees' money. Itwould make more sense for employers and employees to agreethat the employer will pay the price of the low-priced plan;if more money is available, give it to the employees in wagesand let them decide whether they want to spend it on a morecostly health-care plan.   -- Employers need to understand that as more employersconvert to cost-conscious choice, HMOs will take over more ofthe market. This will leave doctors and hospital beds in thetraditional fee-for-service sector in even greateroversupply, and costs in that sector will continue to rise.The higher the costs, the more painful will be the eventualadjustment when employees have to face economic reality. Thatis, when the employer subsidies to fee-for-service careeventually end, employees will face large out-of-pocketpremium costs. It would be better to make the switch now,when the cost of the change is not so great. The lastpassengers to abandon the sinking ship of fee-for-servicecare will have a long way to jump.   ---   Mr. Enthoven, a professor of management at Stanford, ischairman of the university's Committee on Faculty/StaffBenefits and of California's Health Benefits Advisory Councilfor the Public Employees' Retirement System.</TEXT></DOC>
