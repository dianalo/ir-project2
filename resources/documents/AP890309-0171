U.S. officials denied the report of American casualties. Pakistanhas also denied sending personnel into Afghanistan despite repeatedcharges to the contrary from the ruling Marxist government in Kabul.   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported Afghan rebels firedrockets at Kabul airport Wednesday, killing four people, including asmall child. Tass said 16 rockets exploded near Afghan commercialairliners as one was preparing to take off, but it did not saywhether the planes were damaged.   The Radio Kabul report monitored in Islamabad said that inaddition to the deaths of Pakistani and U.S. advisers, 500 Pakistanimilitary personnel were killed in Wednesday's fighting in Nangarharprovince.   Maj. Robin Higgins, a Pentagon spokeswoman, denied U.S. adviserswere killed and said, ``There are no Department of Defense advisersinside Afghanistan.''   She said in an interview in Washington that the only U.S.soldiers in the region are in Pakistan, where they are trainingguerrillas to neutralize lands mines in a program initiated by theUnited Nations.   A State Department spokesman also said no American officials arein Afghanistan.   Tass said rebels launched a ``major attack'' Monday on Jalalabad,about 80 miles east of the capital and 45 miles west of the borderwith Pakistan, where Afghan guerrillas are based. More fighting wasreported Thursday near the airport.   The Soviet television evening news program Vremya on Thursdayshowed dramatic tape of shelling at Jalalabad airport. Acorrespondent standing at the control tower narrated as puffs ofsmoke were shown on runways where shells exploded. Airport workerswere shown running for cover.   Tass said ``irregular troops from Pakistani tribes'' andPakistani military advisers were helping the rebels. The rebelstried to cut the Kabul-Jalalabad road, but a large convoy of armsand reserve troops got through, it said.   Radio Kabul also said ``hundreds of criminals'' were killed bycommunist troops protecting Jalalabad. The radio regularly refers tomujahedeen as criminals, terrorists or opposition extremists.   Tass said 1,500 ``enemy soldiers were put out of action'' onWednesday and Thursday in fighting around Jalalabad.   The report said Pakistani helicopters dropped ammunition for therebels. The Afghan Foreign Ministry protested to Pakistani diplomatsabout their air assistance and irregular troop support to the rebels.   Tass said the rebels fired heavy artillery at security outpostsand populated areas on a road between the Sorubi district and thecity of Jalalabad on Wednesday. Sorubi lies halfway betweenJalalabad and Kabul.   Najibullah Mojaddidi, a guerrilla spokesman, confirmed the fallof a key government garrison at Samarkhiel on the outskirts ofJalalabad. Guerrillas said Samarkhiel's fall is a stepping stone tocapturing Jalalabad.   Tass reported heavy fighting around Samarkhiel, about 5 milessouth of Jalalabad.   But Mojaddidi said the fate of the airport is ``very difficult tosay, but the latest report is that fighting is continuing.''   The airport, however, has been heavily damaged by guerrillas andMojaddidi questioned whether it could be used by government troops.   Tass also said a group of 50 rebels ``laid down their arms'' andjoined forces with Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government in Baghlanprovince.   The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan last month after nineyears of supporting the government.   The guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the Afghan government andhave formed a government-in-exile in Pakistan to take over.   Saudi Arabia on Thursday became the first country to officiallyrecognize the government-in-exile. The oil-rich kingdom has giventhe guerrillas considerable support in their struggle.</TEXT></DOC>
