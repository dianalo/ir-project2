Forecasters said the polar winds blamed in at least 42 deathsaround the country in the past week may stop by Christmas. But thecold had much of the nation well prepared for the 4:22 p.m. ESTstart of winter.   ``I doubt we'll notice it,'' said Terry Conroy, a street cleanerin Syracuse, N.Y., where crews have had to remove snow almost dailyin the past few weeks.   The National Weather Service's Albany, N.Y., bureau describedthe weather as ``cold, with a double underline on that.'' InChicago, where a minus 13 reading this morning broke a minus 12record for the date set in 1872, the weather service warnedtravelers to ``dress for arctic cold.''   It was so cold in Minot, N.D., that the fuel froze in an engineof a train bound for Chicago from Seattle, stranding about 300passengers and crew overnight, said Mike Kirka, an Amtrak ticketagent in Chicago.   The temperature was about 30 below, with the wind chill nearminus 80, when the train pulled into the Minot station shortlybefore midnight, Kirka said. The engine wouldn't restart, and afterthree hours passengers were put up at hotels at Amtrak's expense,he said.   In addition to the 42 cold-related deaths, authorities inPhiladelphia were investigating the deaths of a homeless man whowas found Wednesday on an outdoor vent wrapped in blankets and twoelderly people who died in a home with no heat.   Wind chills were expected today to be as low as 80 below inNorth Dakota, 75 below in Minnesota and 65 below in Missouri.People were urged to stay indoors, and some schools were closedtoday in North Dakota and Nebraska.   Today's low temperature in the Lower 48 states was minus 43 atJordan, Mont.   Other early morning temperatures included minus 28 in Bismarck,N.D.; minus 22 in Minneapolis-St. Paul; 17 below in Des Moines,Iowa; minus 20 in Omaha, Neb.; minus 12 in Rapid City, S.D.; 16below in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and minus 9 in Casper, Wyo.   Little Rock, Ark., was a chilly 20, while Fort Worth, Texas, was24.   But today's surge of arctic air into northern Minnesota appearedto be the last in the series of blasts that have crossed the borderinto Minnesota and plagued the eastern half of the nation for 10days, the weather service said.   ``The trend looks hopeful for a change in the cold northwestflow to a more westerly flow on the weekend over Minnesota,'' theweather service said. ``This means a very slow moderation intemperatures by Sunday and Christmas Day.''   On the last day of fall, gusty winds dropped the wind chill to81 below zero at Minot, N.D., 75 below at Devils Lake, N.D., 69below at Alexandria, Minn., and Jamestown, N.D., and 61 below atAberdeen, S.D.   The southern edge of the cold air on Wednesday extended from NewYork state across Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado,Wyoming and central Montana.   By today, the cold dipped to northern Texas and northernLouisiana. The temperature in Amarillo, Texas, dropped to 1 degreeovernight. By Friday, the arctic was expected to invade NorthCarolina and northern Georgia.   The weather service forecast a ``major freeze'' across the lowerRio Grande Valley of Texas from tonight into Saturday.   In the Midwest, many authorities warned people to takeprecautions against the cold. Sheriff Stan Lyson of WilliamsCounty, N.D., urged residents to stay home unless travel wasabsolutely necessary.   He suggested Christmas travelers inform someone of theirdestination and the route they plan to take. ``I don't think anyonewould last out there very long,'' Lyson said.   Temperatures hovered around 10 degrees Wednesday in Rochester,N.Y., but the wind made it feel like 25 below zero. ``The place ispacked with people drinking hot toddies at the bar,'' said MaryCamp, bookkeeper at the Sea Breeze Inn.   The weather service's official low temperature for the Lower 48states Wednesday was 34 below zero at International Falls andWarroad, Minn., both on the Canadian border. Embarrass, an IronRange town in northeastern Minnesota, reached an unofficial 37below zero.   Wednesday's high at International Falls was only 21 degreesbelow zero.   In the southern Chicago suburb of Harvey, the bitter cold bursta 24-inch water main, cutting service to six communities.   Between 2,000 and 3,000 motorists called for help starting theircars, the Automobile Association of America-Chicago Motor Club said.   Snow fell from the northern Rockies across the northern Plainsand around the Great Lakes, where ``lake effect'' snow fed by themoisture of the lakes piled up 4-foot drifts in western New Yorkstate.   The weather service at Syracuse had measured 50.4 inches of snowfor the fall. At this time last year, only 27.2 inches of snow hadfallen.   Unusually low temperatures this month have strained utilitiesthroughout New York and New England, and could bring brownouts insome areas as winter progresses, officials said.   Temperatures 10 degrees lower than normal for this time of yearhave forced New York, New England and the Maryland-Pensylvannia-NewJersey power pools to share electricity.</TEXT></DOC>
