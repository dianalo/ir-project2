BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TYLER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After years of preparation and realigning hisfamily's multimillion dollar television business, Robert P. Bufordundertook a second career _ one that spends money instead of makingit but better fulfills the motto engraved on his desk nameplate:``On A Mission For God.''   Buford, a management aficionado, has turned from television to adifferent kind of network _ Leadership Network _ where he bringstogether pastors of large churches to talk about running their hugeorganizations.   ``We found that there's more ... in common or more similaritybetween a (large) Methodist, a Presbyterian and a Bible church, orcharismatic church even, in the leadership function than there isbetween a large church and a small church in the samedenomination,'' Buford said.   The skills needed to run such an organization _ staffing,organizing, motivating, budgeting _ are largely ignored inseminaries and are usually treated as ``continuing education.''   In the five years since Buford began his crusade to bring bettermanagement to large churches _ those with more than 1,000 attendingweekly _ he has brought together the 400 senior pastors from variousdenominations, plus other church and organizational staff inseparate meetings _ most of them at a conference center in ColoradoSprings, Colo.   ``What we hope to accomplish is to provide an environment wherethey could hear how to help one another operate in thosecircumstances,'' Buford said, adding that there are 10,000 largechurches in the country.   The discussions at the three-day long sessions generally revolvearound three areas, Buford said: how to set a vision so that thechurch is cohesive, how to manage staff and how to retain theirpersonal, spiritual vitality.   And it's all free, except for the transportation, because Bufordfoots the bill.   ``It struck me that a man's life does not consist of bread alone,that I should live a life of service as well as a life ofaccumulation,'' said Buford, a member of a midsized Episcopal churchwhere he teaches some Bible classes.   ``I had, in my middle 30s, a clear desire to at some point lead alife of service and I'll be 50 in September and I feel that I'membarking on that parallel career.''   Buford is chairman and chief executive officer of BufordTelevision Inc., which owns WMBB-TV, a VHF station in Panama City,Fla., and cable systems in 120 cities and counties in six states.   A private man, Buford has deliberately kept a low profile in hisown community; a recent interview at his office tucked away on awooded lot outside of Tyler is the only one he has given and he hasdeclined repeated offers to become involved in various local civicorganizations.   Buford, who says his model is industrialist-philanthropist AndrewCarnegie, only reluctantly agreed that he could be described as amillionaire, although he owns a third of BTI.   Buford said he has spent ``six or seven years'' preparing hisfamily and realigning BTI to allow him to spend about half his timedealing with Leadership Network.   Like Buford, Leadership Network has been almost invisible: thereis no advertising and participants in the invitation-only meetingsare recruited on recommendation from other pastors.   Even at a retail cost of $279.80, Buford says he doesn't expectto make a profit, and may even lose money, but that's OK.   His leadership organization is branching out and joining forceswith management guru Peter F. Drucker, who has produced ``TheNon-Profit Drucker,'' a five-volume series of discussions withleaders of non-profit organizations.   Buford said he and Drucker believe the mission of a church may bedifferent from many non-profit institutions, ``but the managementissues are not.''   In his latest book, ``The New Realities,'' Drucker extols theplace volunteerism, or ``the third sector,'' has in the nation'seconomy.   ``The third sector is actually the country's largest employer,though neither its workforce nor the output it produces show up inthe statistics,'' Drucker writes.   He estimates 90 million people work as volunteers, in addition totheir regular jobs. There are 979,000 non-profit organizations.   Drucker says they are the fastest growing segment of Americansociety, and ``with this growth has come an urgent need for acomprehensive resource geared specifically to management challengesthat the leaders of non-profit institutions face every day.''   ``Management used to be a bad word in non-profit institutions. Itimplied big business,'' Drucker says, adding that non-profits arebig business and must be held accountable.   ``In the non-profit organization, we use other people's money _the donors' money or tax money _ and we are accountable for it,''Drucker says. ``The specific threat to the non-profit organizationis to become mired in mismanagement, through paper work, proceduresand myriad decision makers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Sept. 8.</NOTE></DOC>
