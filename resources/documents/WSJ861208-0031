PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> BURE, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was on March 5, 1798, that a Swiss army last marched against a foreign foe. The Swiss forces fought a Napoleonic army at Grauholz, near Bern. The Swiss lost.    Now, 188 years later, the Swiss, obsessed with the idea of preserving their neutrality, are preparing themselves in case they have to fight another battle, vowing to get it right this time.    This beautiful little country, famous for chocolate, watches, and, more recently, a chemical spill in the Rhine, is a fortress, bristling with hidden artillery, hideaway Alpine air bases and troops in camouflage suits.    A visitor, invited aloft in a small army helicopter, is challenged to spot the guns, the troops and the air bases below. We zoom sharply up mountainsides and plunge like a roller coaster into the valleys. It is sometimes difficult to spot the horizon.    &quot;You missed an air base there,&quot; says Col. Emil Jaeggi, as the helicopter banks steeply so that we can see a spectacular waterfall.    We skim down another valley. &quot;There is an entire regiment on maneuvers in this valley,&quot; says the colonel. All the visitor can see is cows and -- aha! -- a dozen soldiers, on bicycles, pedaling furiously, automatic rifles strapped to their backs. They belong to one of Switzerland's famous bicycle regiments. Score one for the visitor.    Finally, the hide-and-seek game completed, we land at Bure, in the mountainous Jura region on the French border, to watch, in plain sight, units of the Swiss army on training exercises.    &quot;Remember,&quot; says Col. Jaeggi, himself a business consultant in Zurich, &quot;this is a civilian army. There are 600,000 in our army, but only about 2,000 are full-time professionals.&quot;    Switzerland, Metternich is supposed to have said, &quot;does not have an army; it is an army.&quot; Ten percent of the Swiss population is in that army, and every soldier keeps his rifle and ammunition at home. Males must serve for 30 years, starting at the age of 20. Women serve in small numbers, as volunteers. If the U.S. Army worked the same way, it would have 24 million men under arms. China would have 100 million.    But could an army that last heard a shot fired in anger 188 years ago win? &quot;I think so,&quot; says Corps Commander Eugen Luthy, the chief of the army's general staff, the highest-ranking officer in Switzerland. Interviewed at his office in Bern, Commander Luthy declares:    &quot;Per square kilometer, we have more tanks, more guns, more airplanes than any other army in the world. Germany didn't invade Switzerland in the Second World War, and that was at least in part because they knew we had a tough army. I am proud of our troops.&quot;    The units seen training at Bure are on the first day of a two-week training exercise. Four Swiss-made tanks are hidden on a hill to our left. Three others come clanking out of the woods on our right, attacking. We have a front-row seat.    The tanks on the hill open fire. We can see the puffs of smoke. The sound rolls down the valley and bounces off the mountainsides. The tanks on the attack, racing at full speed through knee-deep mud, reply. Suddenly a yellow bulb atop one of the attacking tanks lights up. &quot;A hit!&quot; says Capt. Christof Kunz.    Capt. Kunz, in civilian life an English teacher at a high school in Baden, is our guide for this exercise. He explains that the tanks aren't firing real shells but that the accuracy of their targeting is being measured electronically.    Once the minibattle is completed, the participants, all in camouflage suits, assemble next to our armored car for a critique by their commanding officer, Capt. Hugo Banziger, a historian in civilian life.    Capt. Banziger isn't pleased. The defenders on the hill, he points out, should have decided before the shooting began which of their tanks would fire at which of the &quot;enemy&quot; tanks. All four of the hill tanks, he says in disgust, fired at the same enemy tank. As for the tanks on the attack, they were bunched too close together. Against a well-trained foe, they would all have been destroyed.    We climb back into the little helicopter and slip and slide through mountain passes to another base, at Frauenfeld, not far from Zurich, where a mobile-artillery battalion is practicing. The battalion, with its 155-mm guns mounted on tank bodies, has taken up positions next to a race track.    The commander is Capt. Thomas Wurgler, a prosecuting attorney in civilian life. &quot;You will note,&quot; he says, as if summing up to a jury, &quot;we are in the middle of a densely populated area. We have no choice: Switzerland is a densely populated country. We will fire these shells straight over the village. We fire between the village church steeples. We won't hit them, but we will make their bells ring.&quot;    Earmuffs, to deaden the sound of the guns, are passed around, and the firing commences. Even with the earmuffs, it is noisy business. But the sheep grazing on the infield of the race track don't seem to mind. &quot;We are all used to this,&quot; says Capt. Wurgler, &quot;even the sheep.&quot;    Back to the helicopter, our destination a secret air base high in the Alps.    The base is in a valley, tall mountain peaks on each side. &quot;Watch this,&quot; says H.J. Ammann, an army pilot who ordinarily is a pilot with Swissair. He points to a mountainside. The mountain, like Ali Baba's cave, opens, and American-made F-5 Tiger jets, towed by tractors, emerge.    The mountain, Capt. Ammann explains, has been hollowed out. The base -- the planes, the barracks, the men -- is inside the mountain. &quot;Look up there,&quot; the captain commands. Extending from the side of the mountain, almost at the peak, is the control tower, barely visible from the ground, invisible from the air.    &quot;It would take something like a direct hit with an atomic bomb to destroy this base,&quot; Capt. Ammann says.    Four F-5s, one after another, thunder down the runway, banking sharply to avoid the snowcapped mountain peaks. &quot;We are a little late getting in the air today,&quot; says Capt. Ammann. &quot;There was a funeral in the village. We don't like to interrupt funerals.&quot;    All the pilots at this base are civilians serving their annual tour of army duty. Many of them fly for Swissair. But three of the pilots in this unit are doctors. There are other, even more secret Alpine bases. The pilots at those bases are full-time professionals. They are probably the finest mountain fliers in the world.    The Swiss army is more than an army. It is a way of life. John McPhee, in his book &quot;La Place de la Concorde Suisse,&quot; wrote, &quot;If you understand the New York Yacht Club, the Cosmos Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Century Club, the Piedmont Driving Club, you would understand the Swiss Army.&quot;    Ambitious young men in Switzerland strive to become army officers. &quot;Everybody that counts in Switzerland is in the army,&quot; says Col. Franz Latscher, a rare professional officer. &quot;You go looking for a job. If you're a lieutenant, that's a qualification. It helps you in your civilian career.&quot;    &quot;It is an elite,&quot; says Corps Commander Josef Feldmann, who is the equivalent of a three-star general in an army without a general (except in periods of national emergency, and then never more than one).    Some Swiss would like to get rid of the army. &quot;We don't need an army now,&quot; says Andreas Gross, a Socialist politician in Zurich. &quot;If there's another war in Europe, it will be nuclear, and our conventional army won't be of any use.&quot;    Mr. Gross is the leader of a group of 2,000 anti-army campaigners who collected 113,000 signatures to put a popular initiative on the ballot to abolish the Swiss army. The vote will probably take place in about two years. &quot;We don't expect to win,&quot; says Mr. Gross. &quot;But we will educate the Swiss people. We will demonstrate to them that the army-officer class is the most conservative force in this country.&quot;    Corps Commander Luthy doesn't worry about the initiative to abolish the army. &quot;There is no doubt of the result,&quot; he says. &quot;We will win.&quot; He is as sure about the outcome as he is about the outcome of any attack on Switzerland.    If the Swiss army was forced to go to war -- and it is significant, perhaps, that its antiaircraft batteries are all aimed to the east -- it would fall back under pressure into the heart of the Alps, into the great Gotthard Massif itself, into the final bastion.    The Swiss army wants people to know that. </TEXT></DOC>
