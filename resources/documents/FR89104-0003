Thomason, Jr., SystemsAccountant, Finance Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536, (202) 633-4705.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Service published a proposed ruleon January 22, 1988, at 53 FR 1791, to amend 8 CFR Parts 232, 233, 235,237, 238, 239, 280, and 299, in order to implement section 206 of Pub.L. 99-591 which places responsibility for physical custody of excludablealiens pursuant to former section 233 of the Immigration and NationalityAct of 1952, as amended (The Act), on the Service. The comment period endedon March 22, 1988. A total of nine comments were received during the commentperiod and considered before preparing this final rule. The following summaryaddresses the substantive comments.1. Numerous commenters requested clarification of the situation when, followinga deportation/exclusion order, the carrier's next regularly scheduled flightto the excluded alien's point of embarkation is full or the carrier isa charter operator that may only operate ad hoc flights. Such clarificationhas been provided to allow the transporting carrier the option of arrangingfor return transportation on other carriers which service the excludedalien's point of embarkation.2. Some commenters also requested clarification regarding notice and timingof carrier responsibility for custody and removal of an excluded alienfollowing a deportation/exclusion order. Carriers become liable for detentionand transportation expenses immediately upon the issuance of a deportation/exclusionorder. It is the carrier's responsibility to track these proceedings asthey have already acknowledged by receipt of Form I-259C, Notice to Carrier,executed upon arrival by the examining immigration officer, that an alienpassenger may be excludable from the United States, and in the event thealien is formally ordered excluded and deported, the carrier will be responsiblefor detention and transportation expenses to the last foreign port of embarkationas provided in andSection; 237.5. The regulations have been modified to allowthe option of having the Service retain custody of the excluded alien forup to seven days following a deportation/exclusion order.3. Several commenters expressed the concern that the proposed rule didnot fully release carriers from custodial and financial responsibilityfor excludable aliens. Section 206 of Pub. L. 99-591 did not repeal section237 of the Act, thus, it does not totally release commercial carriers fromcustodial and financial responsibility for aliens who arrive in the UnitedStates aboard commercial aircraft or commercial vessels without properdocumentation. Commercial carriers are still liable for detention and transportationexpenses of excluded aliens subsequent to a deportation/exclusion order.4. Certain commenters requested clarification regarding carrier/Serviceresponsibility for detained aliens in immediate and continuous transit(TWOV passengers). Although the issue of carrier responsibility for TWOVpassengers may be a thorny one, the rules and regulations are very clear.Pub. L. 99-591 did not repeal section 238 of the Act; thus, contracts enteredinto pursuant to section 238, and in this particular instance we are concernedwith carrier financial responsibility for detained TWOV passengers, arevalid and enforceable. In sum, carriers are responsible for the detentionexpenses of detained TWOV passengers while in Service custody as well ashaving financial responsibility for return transportation to TWOV passengerspoint to embarkation following a deportation/exclusion order.5. One commenter requested more detailed guidance regarding minimum standardsthat must be met for alien detention in a non-service facility. Such guidancehas been included in a revised andSection; 235.3(f).6. One commenter took issue with the specific minimum conditions that mustbe met for aliens detained in a non-service facility. This rule addressesthe change from carrier responsibility to Service responsibility for thecustody and detention of excludable aliens, and also amends the regulationsto conform to statutory deletions and amendments, pursuant to section 206of Pub. L. 99-591; it does not address details of specific alien detentionconditions. The conditions under which aliens are held would be a matterfor other proceedings.In compliance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of Immigration andNaturalization Service certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule isnot a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of Executive Order12291, nor does this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG> 8 CFR Parts 232 and 233Aliens, Immigration, Security measures, Aircraft, Vessels.8 CFR Part 235Aliens, Immigration, Security measures, Aircraft, Vessels, Travel and transportationexpenses.8 CFR Parts 237 and 238Aliens, Immigration, Security measures, Aircraft, Vessels, Travel and transportationexpenses, Transportation.8 CFR Part 239Aliens, Immigration, Security measures, Aircraft.8 CFR Parts 280 and 299Aliens, Immigration, Aircraft, Vessels, Accounting, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isamended as follows:1-2.
