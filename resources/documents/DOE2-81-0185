The texture of magnesite in core slab,thin section, and SEM is almost identical to that of dolomite. Becausethe density of magnesite is close to that of anhydrite and a high associateduranium content causes large gamma-ray deflections similar to that ofshale, magnesite could lead to improper evaluation of lithology and porosityfrom logs and ultimately results in failure to recognize potential reservoirzones. In the authors' core example, magnesite is found in tidal flatand evaporative lagoon dolomites of the Tansill and uppermost Yates Formations.The interval is overlain by Tansill anhydrite and a thick halite sectionof the Ochoan Salado Formation. The magensite consists of anhedral toeuhedral crystals ranging in size from 1 to 4 {mu}m. Within the dolomiteintervals, magnesite occurs in three forms: (1) patches and discretegrains floating in dolomite matrix, (2) pervasive replacement of hostdolomudstoen and pelodial and pisolitic dolowackestone or packstone,and (3) discrete layers interbedded with anhydrite. Mangesite rarelyfills pore spaces in dolomite, but within siliciclastic beds, magnesiteoccurs as a first generation cement and as a replacement of former carbonategrains. Magnesite and dolomite are mutually exclusive in siliciclastedbeds, and magnesite occurs only when anhydrite is abundant. Preliminarymeasurements of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes yield normal Permianvalues for {delta}C/sup 13/, averaging +6.84 o/00 and slightly evaporiticvalues of {delta}O/sup 18/, averaging +1.04; corrected Sr/sup 87//Sr/sup86/ isotopic composition averages 0.70687.</TEXT></DOC>
