The Treasury sold $9 billion of notes at an average annual yield of 8.21%. That was the second of a three-part government financing that concludes today with the most closely watched segment: the sale of $8.75 billion of 29 1/4-year bonds.    Yesterday's setback followed bond-price advances in eight of the previous 11 trading sessions. Some actively traded long-term Treasury bonds fell yesterday about three-quarters of a point, or around $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That included slight declines that came after the Treasury auction results were announced. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 8.39% from 8.32% Tuesday.    The auction results were &quot;slightly disappointing,&quot; said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg andamp; Co., a Westport, Conn., investment research firm. For example, he said the &quot;cover,&quot; or the amount of bids submitted by investors compared with the amount of notes sold, was &quot;slightly below&quot; the average of other recent 10-year note auctions. &quot;We've had such a strong rally that a correction at some point was inevitable,&quot; he added.    Several traders said they had hoped for greater buying by foreign investors than apparently occurred. Some also said money managers both in the U.S. and abroad may have decided to postpone investment decisions temporarily because of confusion about the economic outlook.    Separately, more large banks lowered their prime lending rate to 8 1/2% from 8 3/4%, matching moves Tuesday by most major banks across the country. First RepublicBank, Dallas, said late yesterday that it had lowered its rate to 8 1/2%, effective today. Irving Trust also joined in the prime-rate cuts, which brought the base rate to its lowest level since last September.    Corporate and municipal bond prices also fell yesterday. But short-term interest rates were mixed. Rates on short-term Treasury bills wound up little changed, but the rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, fell. The funds rate averaged just over 6 1/2% yesterday, down from 6.78% Tuesday.    Rumors of a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union circulated in the markets yesterday. Although denied by officials in Moscow, the rumors helped drive up the dollar and depress the price of gold. That in turn, &quot;produced a little rally early in the day in bond prices but had no lasting effect, as evidenced by the rather mediocre interest in the 10-year note auction,&quot; said Peter Bass, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc.    &quot;The real key to this market will be the employment report&quot; to be released tomorrow morning by the Labor Department, said Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;The market really is locked into that report.&quot;    The Labor Department report, covering the nation's employment picture last month, will be examined closely for clues to whether the economy, after expanding for about five years, finally is running out of steam. Most analysts in one recent survey expect the report to indicate the economy's growth slowed during January, but they caution that the report is very difficult to predict and often contains surprises that send shock waves through the financial markets.    According to the median estimate of 39 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., the number of workers on non-farm payrolls expanded about 200,000 last month. That would be down from 326,000 in December. Estimates, though, ranged from 100,000 to 350,000.    Some analysts say the report could show a sizable jump in the civilian unemployment rate, which stood at 5.8% in December. That, they say, would bolster the case for a credit-easing move by the Federal Reserve within a month or so. The Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet Tuesday and Wednesday. The committee will review monetary strategy as well as its money-supply targets.    The Fed committee &quot;probably will decide to issue a directive that will provide for an easing move if there is some solid evidence of further weakening in the economy,&quot; said Robert T. McGee, vice president and financial economist at Irving Trust Co.    &quot;Whatever easing there is, the Fed can't afford to do a lot&quot; because of concern that too large a credit-easing step might lead to a sharp drop in the dollar, Mr. McGee said. &quot;The dollar will be a constraint on the Fed.&quot; He and many other analysts agreed the Fed may decide to authorize steps that would lead to a decline of about a quarter of a percentage point in the federal funds rate.    The Federal Reserve intervened in the credit markets yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system. The move had been expected, many analysts said, and was designed merely to offset technical factors adding reserves to the banking system.    The Fed acted to drain reserves when federal funds were trading at 6 1/2%. Still, the funds rate declined anyway, averaging 6.54%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc.    Some analysts had hoped the Fed would take no action yesterday to stem the drop in the funds rate. If the Fed hadn't taken any action, &quot;that would have been a strong signal&quot; that the central bank already had decided to ease credit, said Mr. Thunberg of Ried Thunberg. But few analysts thought that was likely to occur.    In the bond market, the latest 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 105 7/32 from 106 1/32 Tuesday.    As of late yesterday, the 29 1/4-year bonds to be auctioned today were quoted in when-issued trading at 8.43% bid.    An index of long-term bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman fell 9.83 points to 1317.50. It finished only slightly above its low for the day of 1316.49. The high was 1329.22.    Among short-term rates, the rate on three-month Treasury bills declined slightly to 5.69% bid from 5.70% Tuesday. But the rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills rose slightly to 6.09% bid from 6.08%.    Here are details of yesterday's government auction of 10-year Treasury notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                            10-Year Notes    Applications .......................... $18,320,660,000    Accepted bids .........................  $9,001,520,000    Accepted at low price .................             82%    Accepted noncompetitively .............    $344,000,000    Average price (Rate) ..................   99.427(8.21%)    High price (Rate) .....................   99.696(8.17%)    Low price (Rate) ......................   99.293(8.23%)    Interest rate .........................          8 1/8%   The notes are dated Feb. 16 and mature Feb. 15, 1998.</TEXT></DOC>
