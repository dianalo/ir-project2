Twenty-three percent named the economy; 16 percent,drugs; 10 percent, crime and gangs; 8 percent, the environment; 7 percent,education; and 4 percent, government and politics.;    According to thereport, 57 percent of those questioned said they had &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quitea lot&quot; of confidence in religious institutions to deal with local communityproblems, while 54 percent had that much confidence in volunteer groups suchas the YMCA and 47 percent in the local public school system.;    Opinions ofthe ability of institutions to deal with local problems appeared to be voiceduniformly across different segments of society. But women were more inclined,and young adults less inclined, to place trust in religious institutions.Women voiced more confidence in religious institutions than men by a margin of65 percent to 48 percent.;    Adults 30 years of age or older generally hadgreater confidence in religious institutions than younger people.;    Butyoung people tended to show higher confidence than their elders in all otherinstitutions listed in the survey.;    &quot;This could suggest that the initialimpulse of people when they are young is to seek solutions from secularinstitutions, but later in life they can be expected to turn more to thechurch to channel their voluntary instincts to serve the community,&quot; said theauthors of the report.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Religious News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910112  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  324  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, January 12, 199100012212,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
