Three topical issues are presented to illustratethe application or abuse of scientific data in the political arena andto suggest appropriate responsibilities of scientists beyond the generationof data. The examples include regulation of occupation-related neurotoxicexposure, transfer of neurotoxic pollutants among environmental media,and export of neurotoxic hazards to Third World countries. These examplesillustrate the variety of ways in which neurotoxicants impinge on policyquestions--from international trade, through ecosystem effects, to personaloccupational health and safety.</TEXT></DOC>
