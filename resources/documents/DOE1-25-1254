Thevalue of this method is demonstrated on the basis of 400 patient examinations.The isolated imaging of soft tissues without skeletal superposition givesparticular advantages in diagnosis of the chest and the cranio-cervicalregion. Soft tissue calcifications and calcium-containing concrementsin the bile ducts and in the urinary tract are well demonstrated withoutsoft tissue superposition. The disadvantages and the limits of the methodare discussed, its potential and possible future developments are shown.</TEXT></DOC>
