But for more than three decades, the Air Forceshunned it as a flight of fancy.   Then, in the end, it embraced Northrop's dream to build the B-2``Stealth'' bomber, the world's most expensive airplane at currentestimates of $530 million apiece.   Now Congress must decide whether the United States can afford tobuild a plane the military says it can't afford to do without.   Northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of theflying wing _ chiefly, its reduced liklihood of being detected byradar _ as a side benefit, a nice selling point to the military, forwhat he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane. Aflying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventionalairplane of the same weight. It therefore is more efficient, meaningit requires less power and less fuel, and can carry a greaterpayload.   ``Any reasonable assumptions,'' Northrop said in 1947, ``willalways result in advantage to the all-wing configuration, of suchmagnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations maybe involved in its development.''   In 1981, as the headlines focused on Ronald Reagan's resurrectionof the B-1 program canceled by Jimmy Carter, Jack Northrop, thenretired and near death, was given a special security clearance soPentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34years earlier. The Air Force had finally contracted with the companybearing his name to build a flying wing as the nation's flagshipstrategic bomber.   Long before the public got its first glimpse of the B-2, AirForce Chief of Staff Larry Welch declared that ``the aerodynamicdesign ... is markedly more efficient than that of itspredecessors.'' The B-2, he continued, ``requires far fewer tankers... and carries a very healthy bomb load. It would be a superbbomber even if it weren't stealthy.''   Aside from military considerations, some aviation buffs arerooting for full development and production of the B-2 because ofits potential spin-offs for commercial flight. According to TimWooldridge of the National Air and Space Museum, airlines and airtransport companies have long flirted with the notion of an all-wingdesign for ``span-loaders'' that could fly tremendous distancescarrying huge weights _ oil, for example. ``But nobody's willing tobet the billions of dollars it would cost'' for feasibilityresearch, he notes. ``What airline would bet that kind of money?''   To some in Congress, the billions that will be needed to build afleet of B-2's look like a questionable bet, as well.   By current estimates, each one will cost about $530 million. Putanother way, a single B-2 will cost $100 million more than Toronto'sspectacular Skydome, the world's newest and fanciest sports stadium,replete with hotel, restaurants and retractable roof. The extra $100million would buy a major league baseball team.   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won'tfly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of theHouse Armed Services Committee. ``Members of Congress are balking atspending $4.1 billion this year for the Strategic DefenseInitiative. It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as muchper year on a plane.''   ``This was the worst kind of public policy,'' said Rep. John R.Kasich, R-Ohio. ``To keep something secret all this time and drivethe cost up to $22 billion (to date) will never be tolerated again.''   The Air Force rejects such criticism, suggesting that somemembers of Congress are being coy with their constituents now thatthe cost estimates are public after eight years of top-secretdevelopment. ``The charge that someone was hiding anything from theCongress is ludicrous,'' said Larry Welch, the Air Force chief ofstaff. ``There were dozens and dozens of people in the Congress whowere fully aware of all the details.''   But Rep. Myke Synar, D-Okla, said, ``I attended classifiedbriefings by the Air Force and by Northrop which frankly left a lotto be desired. They were not straightforward, they were not candidand, in many ways, they were very confusing.''   Synar charged that Northrop had ``miserably failed to manage thisprogram.'' Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costelloagreed, saying he had ``serious and grave concerns'' aboutNorthrop's management, and that the firm's quality controls were``terrible.''   Northrop's chairman, Thomas V. Jones, vigorously defended thecompany and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders, saying theprogram had produced an ``extraordinary new aircraft system'' and``unprecedented technical successes.''   The nation's first B-2 bomber made its public debut this summer,18 months later than scheduled. It taxied slowly from its hanger atNorthrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif., and turned onto runway 04 themorning of July 17. Chief Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, whohadn't been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for thehonor, ran up the plane's four General Electric engines and releasedthe brakes at 9:36 a.m. EDT. Twenty-three seconds later, the B-2 wasairborne.   ``The aircraft was very stable; rock stable,'' Hinds reportedlater. ``It's going to be a very easy airplane to fly.''   But not to sell. Before the August congressional recess, theHouse limited B-2 production to two planes next year and two theyear after that _ half what the Bush administration wants. It alsoordered the Pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper productionprogram. The Senate was kinder; it trimmed only $300 million fromthe $4.7 billion sought by the president for the B-2 next year. Acompromise bill may be crafted next month.   Meanwhile, the Air Force has scrambled to redefine the B-2'smission and capability. Originally conceived as a purely strategicbomber to seek out and destroy the Soviet Union's mobile missiles ina nuclear war, it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfireweapon as well.   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,argues that the B-2 would have been ideal, had it been available,for the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. ``Just three to four B-2s couldhave done the job directly from stateside bases,'' Randolph said.   That's a remarkable switch in Air Force thinking. When the raidwas planned by a young Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North,he inquired about having the already operational F-117A stealthfighter-bomber do the job, according to Sweetman.   The Air Force turned North down cold, saying the plane was toovaluable to risk on such a venture.   The question arises: if that is true of the F-117, thought tocost about $100 million per plane, why wouldn't it be true of theB-2, at more than half a billion dollars?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, Aug. 29</NOTE></DOC>
