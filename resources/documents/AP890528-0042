MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In carefully cryptic terms, thetraveling White House is heralding a conciliatory message fromPresident Bush to counter Soviet offers and perhaps defuse NATOdifferences on tactical nuclear weapons.   Bush flew from Rome to Brussels on Sunday for the 40thanniversary NATO summit beginning Monday, and his spokesman said itwould be th forum for a number of U.S. proposals, many of which``have not been presented before.''   The proposals apparently will involve some reduction in U.S.forces in Europe, on terms yet to be disclosed. In addition, thereare likely to be economic gestures toward Moscow, involving arelaxation of restrictions on high-technology exports.   According to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, trooplevels will be one of the issues on the Bush agenda at the meetingwith the leaders of 15 other NATO nations.   Bush himself was silent on the subject, dismissing questionsabout a report that he plans a 10 percent U.S. troop reduction, ashe conferred with Italian leaders and met with Pope John Paul II inRome.   At advance Memorial Day observances on Sunday at an Americancemetery in Nettuno, Italy, near the World War II landing zone atAnzio, Bush spoke of the generations who have grown in peace andprosperity since that war.   ``With no experience of the horror and reduction of war, it maybe difficult for them to understand why we need to keep a strongmilitary deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom anddemocracy,'' the president said. ``The answer is here, among thequiet of these graves.''   That insistence on deterrence, despite Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev's arms reduction offers, is another of the topicsawaiting Bush at NATO.   West Germany has been pressing for immediate talks onshort-range nuclear missiles, most of them deployed on German soil,with ranges of 300 miles and down, meaning that they also would beused on German soil if it came to that.   The Bush administration doesn't want those talks now, wary thatthe Soviet Union would seek to preempt the negotiations with animmediate proposal to eliminate all short-range nuclear weapons.The administration sees those weapons as an essential deterrent,offsetting Soviet superiority in conventional arms.   The administration tried without success to settle thatdisagreement prior to Buh's journey to Europe and the summit.Nevertheless, the administration does not see the difference as acrisis, or an issue likely to overshadow the summit.   The troop question would be a compelling issue, too. Pressure onthat topic is not just international; there are growing demands inCongress for a greater sharing of defense burdens by Europeanallies.   Some reduction in U.S. forces is guaranteed _ at least 4,000under budget decisions already made, and almost certainly more inmanpower assigned to intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which areto be eliminated under a 1987 treaty with the Soviet Union.   According to Pentagon testimony, that will eliminate the jobs ofabout 14,500 U.S. personnel in Europe over the next 16 months. Thearmed forces want to keep most of those personnel in Europe, onother assignments, but there are demands in Congress to bring themhome.   Amid all of that, the administration has indicated that sometroop reduction may already have occurred routinely _ from thelimit of 325,000 to the perhaps 305,000 estimated by anadministration official. The official, who declined to beidentified, said manpower levels fluctuate constantly.   But a swing like that _ if it lasted _ would carry more thanroutine significance.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
