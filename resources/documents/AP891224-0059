If the Soviet Union thought it necessary to intervene in Romaniaon the side of the anti-Ceausescu forces, France ``not only wouldnot object to it, but would support this action,'' Foreign MinisterRoland Dumas told Soviet officials.   There was no indication, however, of imminent militaryintervention by Soviet or other forces. Soviet Premier Nikolai I.Ryzhkov said Saturday that sending the Red Army to Romania would be``impermissible'' and a repetition of past mistakes.   In a later interview Sunday on French TV, Dumas said the Soviets``have just now let us know today that they are in agreement tobegin with us to coordinate all our aid.''   He did not elaborate, but it was clear he meant humanitarian,rather than military aid.   The French army said it will provide 10 trucks and 30 soldiersto help deliver medical aid to Romania.   In a short statement Sunday, the Foreign Ministry said Francerecognizes the National Salvation Committee as the legal authorityin Romania.   So far, France has only been asked for humanitarian aid, but itstands ready to respond if asked to go beyond humanitarianmeasures, Dumas said on French radio.   ``If other requests are made _ I don't know how the events willunfold _ if another demand is made, we will appraise it. I can tellyou we are ready to respond to any new situation,'' he said.   The foreign minister then added, ``Myself, I could very well seethe constitution of a brigade of volunteers. France could help init.''   Interviewed by Agence France-Presse, Dumas recalled thevolunteers who participated in the Spanish Civil War and in theliberation of France from Nazi occupation in 1944.   ``Many people talk, but don't take enough action,'' he said.   In an interview on French TV, however, Dumas said Westernparticipation in military intervention in Romania ``would poseproblems, because the region is a zone of the Warsaw Pact.''   Romanian-born playwright Eugene Ionesco, who lives in France,urged the West ``to provide military aid in arms and ammunition tothe regular Romanian army so it can defend the people against theagents of the security police.''   France has sent two planeloads of medical supplies and emergencymedical teams to Romania in a mission led by Bernard Kouchner,minister for humanitarian action in the Socialist government.</TEXT></DOC>
