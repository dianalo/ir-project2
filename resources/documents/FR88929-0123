The Commissioninvestigative attorney (IA) petitioned for review. On April 4, 1988, theCommission determined to review the ID on issues of domestic industry,prevention of establishment, and tendency to substantially injure the domesticindustry. The Commission solicited written submissions from the partiesto the investigation, other Federal agencies, and interested members ofthe public on the issues on review and on the questions of remedy, thepublic interest, and bonding. The only submissions the Commission receivedwere those filed by complainant The Upjohn Company (Upjohn), the IA, andthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA).On May 13, 1988, the Commission determined to suspend the investigationfor 30 days. On June 24, 1988, the Commission determined to continue thesuspension for another 30 days. On July 11, 1988, the Commission determinedto suspend the investigation until 30 days after final action by the FDAon Upjohn's new drug application (NDA) on the topical minoxidil compositions(ROGAINE), which are the subject of this investigation. On August 17, 1988,the FDA granted final approval for ROGAINE. On August 23, 1988, section337 was amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107) to eliminate the injury requirement and tobroaden the criteria for the industry requirement in patent-based cases.On August 9 and 19, 1988, Upjohn filed motions requesting resumption ofthe investigation for both of these reasons. The IA supported both motions.  After considering the submissions and examining the record developed duringthe investigation, the Commission determined that the investigation shouldbe resumed, that there was a violation of section 337, and that the appropriateremedy for the violation of section 337 is a general exclusion order prohibitingthe importation of infringing minoxidil compositions for the remainingterms of the patents, except under license from the patent holder or subjectto certification.   The Commission also determined that the public interest considerationslisted in subsection (d) of section 337 do not preclude issuance of a generalexclusion order and that while the order is under review by the Presidentpursuant to subsection (j) of section 337, the excluded articles will beentitled to enter the United States under a bond in the amount of 500 percentof the articles' entered value.   The authority for the aforesaid Commission determinations and the generalexclusion order is contained in 19 U.S.C. 1337, as amended by the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and in interim rules 210.53-58 ofthe Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. <ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Commission.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kenneth R.
