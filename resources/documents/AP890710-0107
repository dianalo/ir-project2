Mayor Arthur Eggleton was in Calgary, Alberta, over the weekendfor the announcement that the Calgary Stampede would stage threeshows at the SkyDome in September or October 1990 depending on theToronto Blue Jays' baseball schedule.   ``Toronto natives know about the Stampede,'' said the mayor,wearing a white hat and blue Western shirt. ``Now they'll be able toexperience it.''   The SkyDome, the world's first stadium with a retractable roof,opened last month. It houses the Blue Jays, the Toronto Argonauts inthe Canadian Football League and special events.   The Stampede is a combined agricultural fair and rodeo each Julythat dates to 1886 in Calgary and calls itself ``The GreatestOutdoor Show on Earth.'' The Toronto show would be the first everoutside the western province of Alberta.   O'Sullivan said the mayor should have held some form of publichearing before the plans were announced. He said his organizationwill approach the City Council to seek a ban on any rodeo events inToronto as well as campaign with the SkyDome's management and therodeo's corporate sponsor.   He said the last protest of rodeo events in Toronto took place inthe early 1980s at the Canadian National Exhibition, the fair heldat the end of each summer. No such events have been held morerecently.   ``SkyDome officials came to us last week and said this wassomething that was in the works,'' said Barry MacKay of the TorontoHumane Society. ``We feel that the best way to prevent an accidentto an animal is simply not do it.''   He said the society considers virtually all events in a rodeotreat animals in an unnatural way. While rodeos are a tradition insome parts of the country, MacKay said, that tradition does notexist in Toronto.   ``I can understand the Calgary Stampede in the cultural contextof the Wild West,'' said Nadine Nowlan, a member of the CityCouncil. ``But it's quite contrary to our whole history andtradition. We're not the Wild West, thank God.''   Bob Church, the Stampede's president, said a committee had beenstudying for two years whether to package a show that could travelto the United States and Canadian cities.</TEXT></DOC>
