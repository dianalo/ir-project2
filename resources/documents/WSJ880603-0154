Mr. Renda's plea agreement to charges brought last year calls for him to forfeit $4,250,000, the amount of his personal profit from an alleged scheme that yielded $14 million, according to Edward A. McDonald, chief of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn.    The 47-year-old Mr. Renda of Garden City, N.Y., also agreed to testify against Martin J. Schwimmer, 44, a Kings Point, N.Y., investment adviser and author, charged with him in a 145-count indictment last year.    The case is the largest criminal pension-fund scheme the Justice Department has prosecuted, the government said. The original charges carry maximum penalties of 38 years imprisonment and $1.3 million in fines. For the two charges to which he pleaded guilty, Mr. Renda faces a maximum sentence of 25 years.    Mr. Renda, president of First United Fund, once one of the biggest brokers of certificates of deposit in the U.S., and Mr. Schwimmer brokered the investment of more than $100 million from the benefit plans of Teamsters Local 810 and Local 38 of the Sheet Metal Workers union, AFLCIO, from 1981 to 1984, the government said.    They were charged with paying kickbacks &quot;to officials of Local 810 and its affiliated employee benefit plans&quot; through off-the-books accounts. Officials of the Sheet Metal Workers union weren't accused of such activity; no Teamsters officials were charged in the scheme.    Mr. Renda didn't respond to a request for comment. A woman who answered the phone at Mr. Schwimmer's home yesterday said he wouldn't comment. </TEXT></DOC>
