To test the adequacy of the various methods of data acquisitionsand radiological assessment a mock assessment exercise is currently beingconducted by the department. This paper outlines the proposed methodologywhich provides for the use of probabilistic modelling based upon theAtomic Energy of Canada Ltd SYVAC variability analysis approach usingnew models (SYVAC 'A') and data appropriate to UK conditions for a deephorizontal tunnel repository concept. This chapter describes the choiceof a suitable technique for the sampling of data input to the SYVAC 'A'model and techniques for analysing the predictions of dose and risk madeby the model. The sensitivity of the model predictions (risk and doseto man) to the input parameters was compared for four different methods.All four methods identified the same geological parameters as the mostimportant.</TEXT></DOC>
