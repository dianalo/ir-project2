<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-1064 </DOCNO><TEXT>The central and fringe field of a Mobley magnet were measured using nuclearmagnetic resonance and Hall voltage differences method. The field uniformitycan be raised from +- 7 x 10/sup -4/ to +- 3 x 10/sup -4/ by adjustingthe thickness of spacers between magnetic poles. The effects of the place,thickness, width of the magnetic screen on Mobley magnet fringe fieldhave been observed. The errors between the results of two method areanalysed and the accuracy is given.</TEXT></DOC>
