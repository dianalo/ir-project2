Environmental Watchdog; Dismiss Sanctions as Weapon</HEAD><BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two dozen nations Saturday agreedto enlist the United Nations as the world's environmental watchdogbut decided against arming it with the weapon of economic sanctions.   Presidents, premiers and ministry-level officials from 24countries signed a document they stressed was a politicaldeclaration rather than a legally binding commitment.   It agrees to set up a ``new institutional authority'' in theUnited Nations to ``develop instruments and define standards'' tocombat atmospheric pollution.   The body could take unspecified ``appropriate measures'' toenforce its decisions, the document said.   That phrasing differed from an earlier text giving the UnitedNations authority to impose ``economic sanctions ... on goodsproduced under conditions with negative impact for the atmosphere.''   ``We should avoid accentuating (the idea of) penalties,'' DutchPremier Ruud Lubbers told reporters.   ``We stuck to the word `measures' because we need a good balancebetween measures in terms of penalties and measures in terms ofassistance'' to help countries comply with the U.N. rules, he said.   The International Court of Justice, the U.N. judicial arm basedin The Hague, would be the ultimate authority to settle disputes,according to the document.   At issue in the gathering was the gradual heating of the earth'satmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect,'' and the depletion ofthe globe's protective ozone shield, which filters outcancer-causing radiation from the sun.   ``What we call for is unprecedented,'' said Norway's premier, GroHarlem Brundtland. She organized the conference with Lubbers andFrench Premier Michel Rocard.   ``If we don't begin immediately, life on earth will be impossiblechemically in three centuries' time,'' Rocard said. ``But if webegin immediately, we need not panic.''   Other key figures included King Hussein of Jordan, and presidentsFrancois Mitterrand of France and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.   Also present for Saturday's signing ceremony were ChancellorHelmut Kohl of West Germany, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,Premier Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, and President Daniel arap Moi ofKenya.   Other signatories are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ivory Coast,Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand,Senegal, Sweden, Tunisia and Venezuela.   The document said Third World countries where pollution-fightingmeasures would be ``an abnormal or special burden'' should getfinancial aid.   A Western diplomat told The Associated Press several Third Worldnations privately had demanded a blanket guarantee the West wouldshoulder most of the financial burden.   Charles Secrett, a spokesman for the Friends of the Earthenvironmentalist group, said of the gathering, ``There's a realdanger of (political) leaders jumping on the environmental bandwagonto show how `green' they are.''   Earlier this month, the 12-nation European Community agreed tophase out by 1999 all production of chlorofluorocarbons, thechemicals that deplete the ozone layer.   In Hong Kong on Saturday, the government of the British colonysaid it is drafting legislation to reduce imports ofchlorofluorocarbons and ban their production.   Many aerosol spray cans and domestic refrigerators contain theharmful gases, which also are used in the electronics and plasticsindustries.</TEXT></DOC>
