Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR BON STK </IN><G> SEC CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The congressional subcommittee investigating Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is focusing on allegations that prices of at least two Drexel issues of so-called junk bonds were manipulated, according to a Republican congressional aide and another person familiar with the investigation.    As part of those allegations, the aide said, investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee are looking into whether parts of some bond issues were improperly placed with affiliates of Drexel and with partnerships that included Drexel executives.    Staff members of the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), have been investigating Drexel for more than six months. At least some of their findings will be presented at hearings scheduled for tomorrow and Thursday. The subcommittee last week subpoenaed Michael Milken, the head of Drexel's high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bond operations, to appear before it tomorrow.    A Drexel spokesman said yesterday, &quot;We can't comment on anything that may or may not be the subject of the hearings, since we have been promised the subcommittee's report, and we haven't yet received it.&quot; He said he was referring to a report that subcommittee investigators are preparing for this week's hearings.    A subcommittee investigator declined to comment on any aspect of the Drexel inquiry.    The Republican aide said the investigators may have additional allegations he hasn't been informed of.    &quot;I haven't seen every deal they are looking at, but that's the guts of it. This isn't Ivan Boesky II,&quot; he said, referring to the central figure in the Wall Street insider-trading scandal. But, he said: &quot;It's stuff that can't be easily dismissed. . . . We do think some legal and policy questions are raised,&quot; including issues touching on &quot;general anti-fraud rules.&quot;    The aide said laws covering the treatment of debt issues are unclear in this area, but that handling equity issues in a similar fashion probably would violate securities rules prohibiting &quot;free riding&quot; and withholding of &quot;hot-issue&quot; securities.    A hot issue is a security whose bid price is higher than its fixed public-offering price on the day it is offered. Free riding occurs when a member of an underwriting account withholds part of a public offering and then resells it at a profit. Withholding involves selling portions of a hot-issue offering to a firm's employees or their relatives in violation of securities rules.    Investigating such matters would enable the subcommittee to look into junk bond transactions while steering clear of investigations of Drexel, by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by a Manhattan grand jury, that grew out of the insider-trading scandal.    Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick Joseph, is expected to testify before the subcommittee Thursday.    The SEC notified Drexel in January that the SEC's staff would recommend civil charges of major securities-law violations against Drexel, Mr. Milken, his brother, Lowell Milken, and several other Drexel employees. Drexel has argued to the SEC that no charges should be filed. </TEXT></DOC>
