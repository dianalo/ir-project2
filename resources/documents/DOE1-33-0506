Of all thesetechniques, the Random Decrement is unique in that it provides the homogeneouscomponent of the system response. Using this quality, a system identificationtechnique was developed based on a least-squares fit of the signaturesto estimate the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices of a linear randomlyexcited system. The results of an experiment conducted on an offshoreplatform scale model to verify the validity of the technique and to demonstrateits application in damage detection are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
