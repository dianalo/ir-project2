The sealed report, portions of which were obtained by The NewYork Times, also calls ``highly unusual'' Meese's 1985 call to theWhite House about the pipeline, and reveals that a sensitive memodiscussing financial guarantees for the project is missing fromMeese's files.   The report makes no recommendation that Meese be prosecuted butis said to raise numerous instances of questionable conduct and toprovide indications that Meese may have known about the plan to payoff Israel's Labor Party to prevent Israel from attacking thepipeline.   Meese has previously said that his involvement in the pipelinewas ``limited'' and ``totally lawful.''   The attorney general announced last week that he will step downlater this summer, saying the report by independent counsel JamesMcKay had ``vindicated'' him because it recommended no criminalprosecution.   In an interview aired Saturday, Meese said he couldn't commenton the specifics of the document. He was asked about a NationalPublic Radio report that said that McKay concluded in anotheraspect of his investigation that Meese could have been charged inconnection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Bell stock.   ``I think it's very unfair, quite frankly, for anyone to leakinformation that is purportedly in a report that I can't evencomment on,'' Meese said on the Cable News Network show, ``Evansand Novak.''   McKay submitted the report last week to a three-judge federalappeals court panel. Portions were also given to individualsmentioned in it so they could make rebuttal comments before it ismade public.   The Times published a story on the report in Saturday's editionsbut did not identify its source. One source, speaking on conditionof anonymity, told The Associated Press that the portions obtainedby the newspaper were made available to E. Robert Wallach, Meese'sformer lawyer and confidant. Executives of the Times have declinedcomment.   Wallach is awaiting trial in New York on a racketeeringindictment accusing him and two others of taking illegal paymentsfrom Wedtech Corp., a Bronx, N.Y., defense contracting firm, toinfluence Meese and other government officials.   McKay issued a statement Friday saying he would ``seek sanctionsagainst the person or persons responsible'' for leaking material inviolation of a court order. His office refused to elaborate furtherSaturday.   Wallach did not returned a reporter's telephone calls. Hislawyer, George Walker, said by telephone Saturday from SanFrancisco that he could not comment on the McKay report because itwas under seal.   Walker said he did not know who leaked the report but added:``If the order indicates that the document cannot be released, thenobviously McKay would have a right to request sanctions to anyonewho did that. Other than that, I don't want to speculate as to whomay or may not have done it.''   According to the Times account, Meese was asked in November 1987by McKay about his understanding of a memorandum from Wallach onthe pipeline, which was to take Iraqi oil to the Gulf of Aqaba.   McKay asked whether Meese understood when he received the memoin September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would godirectly to the Labor Party.   Meese replied that he couldn't ``recall specifically, but thatcertainly would be consistent with my understanding and wouldexplain why Mr. (then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres waspersonally interested.''   However, two months later, Meese submitted a clarification ofhis testimony, saying he didn't recall that part of the memo. Theclarification came a few weeks after news accounts reported thatthe memo from Wallach to Meese mentioned planned payments to theLabor Party, constituting a possible violation of the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act.   Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, said Meese hadbeen consistent in his statements about his knowledge of the planto make payments to the Israeli Labor Party. Lewin said Meese doesnot recall reading the portion of the memo dealing with payments tothe political party and that is what Meese meant to say when hegave the statement to McKay in November 1987.   McKay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of abribery plan and that the available evidence was thereforeinsufficient to conclude Meese's activities violated the corruptpractices act. Israeli officials were unavailable to be questionedand several American witnesses invoked their right not toincriminate themselves.   McKay found that Meese was ``closely involved'' in 1985 indiscussions about building the pipeline. McKay said the project wasof limited interest to the U.S. government until Meese calledRobert McFarlane, then national security adviser, at the WhiteHouse to set up a meeting for Wallach and Swiss oilman BruceRappaport, one of the pipeline project's partners.   ``It was highly unusual for a Cabinet officer to request Mr.McFarlane to meet with the Cabinet officer's friend about a matterof commercial interest to the friend,'' the report said.   Before Meese's phone call, the pipeline project was beingmonitored in a limited way by the National Security Council andother U.S. agencies. Afterward, members of the NSC staff workeddiligently, sometimes outside normal government channels, to tryand get U.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees forthe pipeline, the Times quoted the report as saying.   McKay also said a sensitive Justice Department memo to Meeseabout the pipeline was missing from his files.   The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possibleU.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees for thepipeline, according to the report. The memo was written atWallach's urging by a department attorney, whom Wallach hadrecommended that Meese hire for the position, and recommended apossible solution to the legal problem, the Times reported.   The pipeline project was never built. It was scuttled in 1986 byMcFarlane's successor, John Poindexter.</TEXT></DOC>
