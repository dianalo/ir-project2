Mr. Shribman is correct in his assessment of Iowa'sdeclining population as a whole, which, in fact, decreased5%, a net out-migration of 270,000 people since 1980.</LP><TEXT>   Do these figures, however, mean Iowa's demise? In DesMoines and other profit centers across the state, itcertainly does not. The greater Des Moines area has grown 8%since 1980. The 12-county Des Moines-Ames corridor includesabout 24% of the state's population and is the capital ofcommerce, communications and state government, and home ofIowa State University, Drake University and about 10 privatecolleges and universities. Greater Des Moines offersstability and future for the cities and towns that surroundour metro area.   Michael V. Reagen   Chamber of Commerce Federation   Greater Des Moines   Des Moines, Iowa   ---   Your story skirted the essential dynamic of ruraldepopulation, whether it's in Indiana or Iowa or any otherfarm state. &quot;Crisis&quot; or not, I'd bet my bottom dollar that(a) every last acre of Iowa crop ground is still inproduction, and (b) said production is increasingly dominatedby a relative handful of profitable, and (one would assume)reasonably happy family partnerships. These are farmers whosurvived the '80s because they didn't incur crippling landdebts, focusing instead on efficient, highly mechanized,large-scale cropping of rented ground. More than ever,farming is a low-margin, high-volume business in which thesuccessful producer is not a concurrent landowner.   Life does go on for those who survive the relentless crushof consolidation, albeit with fewer neighboring farms andpoorer, smaller towns, which traditionally have relied uponthe needs of numerous farm families as well as the land fortheir survival.
