Consider the changes that already can be seen. ThePalestinian issue is certain to get renewed attention oncethe confrontation with Iraq ends. At the same time, the Westno longer sees Iran's government as a regime it can afford toshun.</LP><TEXT>   In Europe, America's recent tilt toward Germany and awayfrom its traditional &quot;special relationship&quot; with Britain hasbeen slowed. U.S. antipathy toward Japan is deepening. Turkeyhas won Western gratitude, paving the way for greater U.S.aid and European integration. And a new international programto stop chemical and nuclear-weapons programs, such asIraq's, already is under discussion.   &quot;My strong impression is that not very many things willstay the same,&quot; says Rep. Lee Hamilton, an Indiana Democratand a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Not all the ripples can be foreseen right now; much woulddepend on the outcome of any U.S.-led war in the region. Butthe timing of this crisis, coming just as the old ColdWar-era political structures are collapsing, guarantees thatit will have an even more profound impact than would normallybe expected from such a highstakes internationalconfrontation.   Indeed, President Bush and his aides have purposely framedthe showdown as the event that will define the new worldalignment just as surely as the Yalta conference shaped thepost-World War II world. For starters, that means the crisisis coming just as the White House, Congress and the U.S.public are sorting out who will be America's closest friendsand allies in the new global order.   The U.S. now is bonded more closely than ever to thegovernments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, its main Arab alliesin the coalition opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. As aresult, the U.S. has assumed more responsibility than everfor their security.   That, in turn, is certain to produce one of the mostironic effects of the crisis: a renewed drive to resolve theplight of the Palestinians. That's just what Saddam Husseinclaimed from the beginning he was seeking as one outcome ofhis invasion of Kuwait.   Having identified themselves so openly with the U.S.,Egypt and Saudi Arabia will insist that a renewed effort byWashington to resolve the fate of Israeli-occupiedPalestinian lands is a requirement for their politicalsurvival in the face of anti-U.S. sentiments stirred up byIraq. Only a renewed drive on the Palestinian question,they'll argue, will allow moderate Arabs to demonstrate tothe Arab masses that the Americans they have embraced aren'tinterested only in Persian Gulf oil, but also in helping toresolve the most emotional political issue facing Arabs.   &quot;The most effective way for the U.S. and the West ingeneral to deal with the Arab backlash, whatever it may be,is to take up the question of the occupied territories,&quot; saysJames Placke, a former State Department Middle East expert.   But the crisis also is likely to markedly alter the waythe U.S. approaches the shopworn concept of an Arab-Israeli&quot;peace process.&quot; Washington now has little more appetite fordealing with Yasser Arafat's Palestine LiberationOrganization in an effort to arrange directIsraeli-Palestinian talks; by embracing the Iraqi invasion,Mr. Arafat has thoroughly alienated the Bush administration.   Instead, another development in the current crisis -- thewarming of long-strained ties between the U.S. and Syria --could open the way to a much broader peace process. Syria'sdispatch of troops to Saudi Arabia raises hope that the U.S.might be able to extract its cooperation in a broader peaceprocess between Israel and Arab nations.   &quot;I think we'll have a regional angle called a regionalsecurity conference, in which we'll try to sneak thePalestinian issue in through the back door,&quot; says WilliamQuandt, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution.Yet any renewed drive on the Palestinian issue is likely toproduce further strains between the U.S. and Israel, whichnow has a right-wing Likud government far more reluctant toconsider any concessions on occupied lands than the Jewishstate's previous national coalition governments.   The crisis also has begun a process of Westernre-evaluation of relations with the Iranian government ofPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani. &quot;In a neighborhood where thereare a lot of tough regimes, the Rafsanjani regime doesn'tlook like the worst around after all,&quot; says Mr. Quandt. &quot;Intime I think there will be a relaxation.&quot;   The rebuilding process with Tehran is moving slowly; Iranis getting some credit for refusing to support Iraq in itsfight with the West, and for complicating Iraqi planning byactivating troops along their border. Yet the U.S. also iswary because Iran seems to be allowing some smuggling ofgoods into Iraq despite the United Nations trade embargo. Sofar, the U.S. has made one tentative good-will gesture towardIran by lifting an embargo on purchases of Iranian oil. ButIranian diplomats complain privately that the West isn'tshowing more gratitude.   The changes are hardly restricted to the Middle East.Washington's ties to London, which had seemed to fade inimportance as the Bush administration focused in the pastyear on the unification of Eastern and Western Europe,suddenly are as warm as ever because of Britain's unflinchingsupport of President Bush's tough stand against Iraq. Ties toFrance, though strained slightly at the moment over PresidentFrancois Mitterand's diplomatic overture to Iraq, generallyhave grown stronger and closer because of France's agreementto dispatch about 10,000 troops to Saudi Arabia.   Similarly, by cutting off Iraqi oil pipelines and invitingin Western troops, Turkey has won deep U.S. and Europeangratitude. That could presage a shift in the traditional U.S.priority for Greece in foreign aid, lead to greater sentimentamong U.S. allies in Western Europe to satisfy Turkey's pleasfor economic integration in Europe and perhaps produce moreU.S. help in resolving Turkey's dispute with Greece overCyprus.   The crisis also has pushed along the changes already underway in U.S.-Soviet ties. By backing America's political driveto challenge Iraq, the Soviet Union already has helped winitself an initial dose of economic aid from the U.S. and anend to the Jackson-Vanik trade restrictions that hobbledU.S.-Soviet trade since the 1970s.   At the same time, though, ties to the more traditionalU.S. friends, Germany and Japan, have been strained by U.S.bitterness that those two states, deeply dependent on PersianGulf oil, haven't been more helpful in providing financialaid and logistical support for the big military buildup toconfront Iraq. The Bush administration claims publicly thatit is satisfied with the level of their contributions, butlawmakers in Congress don't hide their unhappiness.   &quot;There's a feeling they haven't done enough,&quot; says Rep.Hamilton. &quot;They haven't fulfilled the pledges they've made.&quot;   ---                       The Coalition                                                                                                          Nations participating in the U.S.-led coalitionconfronting Saddam Hussein over the invasion of Kuwait                                                                                                        Nations with                             Nations providing military forces on                       other forms of the ground in                            assistance, Saudi Arabia                             including basing,                                          naval, civilian                                          and other support                                                                                                        Bahrain                                  Argentina Bangladesh                               Australia Egypt                                    Belgium France                                   Canada Kuwait                                   Czechoslovakia Morocco                                  Denmark Oman                                     Italy Pakistan                                 Netherlands Qatar                                    New Zealand Saudi Arabia                             Norway Senegal                                  Spain Syria                                    Turkey United Arab Emrites United Kingdom                                                                                                          Sources: The White House, U.S. State Dept.</TEXT></DOC>
