Constitution: In conventional fuel assemblies,it is required to suppress the power per unit length to less than a limitedvalue so as not to degrade the integrity, and the fuel enrichment ata position of higher thermal neutron fluxes is reduced in order to decreasethe local power peakings, which leads to the reactivity loss and lowersthe fuel economy. In this invention, fuel rods in which fuel materialsare filled and water rods through which coolants flow are disposed ina 9 x 9 matrix in which the fuel rods having the highest average enrichmentare disposed to the outermost circumference of the fuel assembly andthe total of the transversal area of the water rods is made greater thanfour times of the transversal area of the fuel rods. In this way, thefuel enrichment at the outermost circumference opposing to the watergap where the neutron flux distribution is high is increased to improvethe neutron utilization and also improve the fuel economy.
