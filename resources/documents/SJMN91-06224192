It is a poor strategy,they say, because commodity prices have declined in value compared to finishedgoods.;    Also, Australia has had difficulty attracting job-creating foreigninvestment because the country is still trying to overcome image problems.Many still perceive it as a country of constant labor strife, said Mike VanHorn, president of the San Francisco-based Pacific Rim Consortium, aninternational investment consultant.;    Some tourism industry leaders say theAustralian economy can most efficiently be buoyed by bolstering the travel andleisure industry.;    The United States is seen as the market with thegreatest potential for growth because it is large but under-exploited byAustralians. A study based on interviews with 2,400 Americans concluded thatAustralia is the foreign country U.S. citizens would most like to visit. Thesurvey was conducted by Menlo Consulting Group, a Palo Alto-based travelresearch firm.;    Currently, more Japanese, New Zealanders and Britons visitAustralia than Americans.;    The commission is spending $1 million on publicrelations and direct-mail solicitations and about $4 million on magazine ads.It's also spending about $6 million on the television portion of the campaign.The commission says it has already received nearly 120,000 queries fromAmericans who viewed the first commercial, which was broadcast in six U.S.cities between May 27 and June 30. A second commercial will be broadcast overthe next two months.;    Partly as a result of the campaign, American pleasurevisits to Australia in 1991 are expected to increase by about 8 percent over1990, said the commission's John King, director of Australian travel promotionin the Americas.;    Including visitors from other parts of the world, saidKing, tourism is expected to be Australia's greatest generator of foreignearnings for the third consecutive year.;    Australian companies in theleisure and hospitality industries have benefited from reduced airline fares.Qantas, the Australian airline, dropped ticket prices in March. U.S. airlinesserving Australia -- United, American, Continental and Northwest -- respondedby also cutting fares.;    In all, the airlines have sold 35,000 special-fareseats for travel between March and September 1991. That is the heaviestAustralian-bound booking in the United States since 1988, the year Australiahad a record-high 322,000 American visitors.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GEORGE WHITE, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910811  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4T  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  519  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday August 11, 199100224192,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
