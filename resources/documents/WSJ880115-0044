The suitor said it decided to make the $69.8 million offer after failing to reach an agreement to acquire American Cellular, a Pleasantville, N.J.-based owner of mobile telephone systems in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.    New York-based Cellular Communications, which owns such systems in Ohio and Texas, said it already owns about 220,000 shares, or a fully diluted 2%, of American Cellular, and if the tender offer succeeds would own about 53%.    Cellular Communications stock rose 50 cents to close at $17.25 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday, while American Cellular was quoted at $16 bid, up $3, in OTC trading. </TEXT></DOC>
