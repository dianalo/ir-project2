Wymer, who has beencharged with securities and mail fraud in connection with$100 million of missing municipalities' funds.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jean Kawahara said the governmentwas concerned that Mr. Wymer might flee if set free on bail.Federal agents found a copy of a booklet, &quot;How To LaunderMoney,&quot; on his dresser when they conducted a search of theWymer home in Newport Beach, Calif., on Tuesday, she said.</LP><TEXT>   Paul N. Murphy, an attorney for Mr. Wymer, said the bookbelonged to Mr. Wymer's wife, Anne Marie. &quot;I don't want tocomment on his wife's nightstand reading,&quot; Mr. Murphy said.&quot;But there is no indication that Mr. Wymer read or subscribedto {the advice in} the book.&quot;   In addition, Mr. Murphy said that the missing $100 millionof funds from clients of Mr. Wymer's former firm resultedfrom &quot;trading losses&quot; and weren't the result of anywrongdoing. Mr. Murphy said that Mr. Wymer was &quot;contrite, notdefiant,&quot; and that he was willing to &quot;assist the governmentin untangling the case.&quot;   Mr. Wymer was arrested earlier this week at his NewportBeach home by federal agents and charged with three counts ofsecurities and mail fraud. Last week, a federal judge frozethe $1.2 billion of funds managed by Mr. Wymer's former firm,Institutional Treasury Management Inc. of Irvine, Calif., andhis personal checking and savings accounts, after theSecurities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuitagainst Mr. Wymer and his former company.   U.S. District Magistrate Judge Venetta S. Tassopulos saidshe denied Mr. Wymer's request for bail because he hadn'tprovided documents showing what happened to his clients'missing money.   Ms. Kawahara said the government was concerned that Mr.Wymer had &quot;access to hundreds of millions of dollars in cash&quot;and that the documents tracing the missing funds hadn't beenfound. She said Mr. Wymer, owner and former president ofInstitutional Treasury Management, had a net worth of $20million and received $4 million in income in 1991.   As of October, Mr. Wymer had a personal checking accountwith $9.9 million in it at First Interstate Bank, she said.It was apparently a &quot;clearing house&quot; for the money he wasmanaging on a discretionary basis for clients, she said. Inaddition, Mr. Wymer recently paid off a $675,000 loan on aproperty in Newport Beach, and sold a private plane for$500,000, she said. The government was &quot;concerned about hisliquidity,&quot; she said.   Ms. Kawahara also said there was concern about a letter toMr. Wymer indicating that he planned to set up trust accountsin Canada &quot;for his personal benefit.&quot;   Mr. Murphy said that Mr. Wymer knew of the impendingarrests &quot;and chose not to leave even though he had ampleopportunity.&quot; He said that Mr. Wymer is &quot;entitled to goliquid&quot; to raise money to prepare a defense. Mr. Murphy saideven though Mr. Wymer's personal accounts are frozen, hiswife has offered to put up for collateral her two autos andhis parents offered to put up their personal residence tocome up with bail of $350,000 to $400,000.   Magistrate Judge Tassopulos said that amount wasn'tsufficient.   Michael Perlis, another attorney for Mr. Wymer, said it'slikely that a federal judge today will unfreeze about $960million of Institutional Treasury's $1.2 billion of funds.   Institutional Treasury specialized in using allegedlysophisticated trading strategies with U.S. Treasurysecurities to bring cash-strapped cities higher returns.</TEXT></DOC>
