In his first full news conference in four months, Mr. Reagan wouldn't identify who the agitators were, but he said, &quot;There is every evidence these riots are not just spontaneous and home-grown.&quot;    Most analysts say the unrest has grown out of local discontent, and Mr. Reagan's statement will anger the Arab leaders Mr. Shultz is trying to involve in a new Middle East peace plan. Mr. Reagan also avoided criticism of the Israelis for their suppression of the Palestinians.    The president also made remarks about South Africa that may stir up another foreign policy controversy. Explaining why he hasn't supported forces opposing that country's regime as he has backed &quot;freedom fighters&quot; elsewhere, Mr. Reagan said there isn't an armed insurrection in South Africa and that government opponents are divided. He said the country's policy of apartheid &quot;is a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy.&quot;    On another foreign-policy matter, Mr. Reagan delivered his strongest public condemnation yet of Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on drug and racketeering charges. &quot;What we would like to see is a return to democracy and a civilian government in Panama, and not this domination by, literally, a military dictator,&quot; Mr. Reagan asserted.    Mr. Reagan wouldn't say, though, whether his administration will certify in a report due next week whether Panama has done enough to stop the flow of drugs through the country to warrant new U.S. aid.    In an unusual move, the president also said that government statistics due out this morning will show &quot;good news&quot; on the economy. The government is scheduled to release a revised estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth, and the president's comments suggest that figure will be higher than reported last month. That earlier report said the economy's total output, or gross national product, expanded at a 4.2% inflation-adjusted rate during last year's final quarter.    Although the nationally televised news conference was Mr. Reagan's first since last October, the session was largely uneventful. Mr. Reagan was challenged on several controversial issues, but he deflected questions on them.    Mr. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese, who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline advocated by one of Mr. Meese's friends. Mr. Reagan said he couldn't remember being told anything about the pipeline, and expressed &quot;every confidence&quot; in Mr. Meese's integrity. He also criticized the &quot;lynch mob atmosphere&quot; that has accompanied investigations of his aides.    Mr. Reagan went somewhat further than he has before in supporting George Bush's contention that he expressed reservations about the administration's secret arms sales to Iran. He wouldn't reveal details of the vice president's misgivings. But in a rambling explanation, he suggested that any opposition to the policy within the administration, including that voiced by Secretary of State Shultz and former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, stemmed from fears that the opening to Iran would be misconstrued as an arms-for-hostages deal if it became public.    Mr. Reagan also criticized Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson, who earlier in the day had maintained that his Christian Broadcasting Network had once known the location of American hostages in Lebanon. &quot;Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?&quot; Mr. Reagan asked.    The president also defended a Pentagon decision to assign Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a former aide to Mr. Weinberger, to United Nations forces in southern Lebanon. Col. Higgins was abducted last week. Mr. Reagan said Col. Higgins volunteered for the duty, and added that the marine's captors &quot;would have a hard time getting secrets that could harm this country from a person of that kind.&quot;    On the issue of U.S. aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, Mr. Reagan seemed to indicate that he is prepared to accept a package of purely humanitarian aid proposed this week by congressional Democrats. The Democrats were instrumental in voting down the president's recent proposal for an aid package that included military assistance. Asked about their package, he said &quot;if we can get that, that's fine,&quot; and indicated the administration would continue efforts to get military aid.    ---   Alan Murray contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
