(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Insilco Corp. said Thursday its boardapproved a management-led buyout offer that values thehigh-technology and specialty consumer products company at $950million.   The board's action in backing the $29-a-share offer came twodays after the company disclosed that its management wasconsidering making an offer to acquire the company in a leveragedbuyout.   In a leveraged buyout, investors typically borrow heavily to buyout a company and then pay off the debt with the target company'scash flow or the sale of its assets.   Insilco officials would not say whether there had been anyoutside offers for the company.   ``It's certainly in the ballpark of what's reasonable,'' saidArthur M. Stupay, an analyst with Prescott, Ball and Turben ofCleveland. ``It's a good offer.''   Stupay said he doubted a better offer would be forthcoming.   ``I don't think too many people can understand this company,''he said.   But in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Insilco rose $2 ashare to $29.25, or 25 cents above the offered price.   In recent years, Insilco, once known as the International SilverCo., has restructured itself into an industrial holding companywith operating companies that make products for high-technologyindustries and speciality consumer markets.   Insilco makes Red Devil paints, Rolodex rotary files, metalcartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry andDual-Lite emergency lighting equipment.   Stupay said management probably made the offer because it was``frustrated that good earnings did not lead to higher stockprices. They said if stockholders would not pay higher values, wewould.''   Under the buyout agreement, the management-led group ISCHoldings Inc. will pay $29 for each of the company's 25.6 millionshares. ISC Holdings, which also includes certain affiliates ofFirst Boston Inc., will assume Insilco's debt, giving the deal atotal indicated value of $950 million.   A cash tender offer will begin within five business days, thecompany said.   On Wednesday, Insilco soared $6 a share in heavy tradingfollowing an announcement that management might attempt a leveragedbuyout.   In making the announcement on Tuesday, Insilco said there wereno assurances an offer would be made or completed.   The management group has obtained commitments totaling $960million to finance the purchase, including $430 million fromaffiliates of First Boston.   In the second quarter, Insilco earned $11.7 million, or 55 centsper share, compared with $11 million, or 52 cents a share, in thesame period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $196.4 million from$154.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
