On May 24, 1988, the Commission temporarilyapproved GSCC's application for registration as a clearing agency underSection 17A of the Act,\5\<NOTE/> and authorized GSCC to provide trade comparison servicesto its members in order to assist those members in settling, among themselvesand outside GSCC facilities, delivery and payment obligations arising fromtrades GSCC reported to its members as compared.\6\<NOTE/> The proposals under consideration today would authorize GSCCto complete the basic core of its services, establish membership and accessrestrictions for its netting and settlement systems, and implement a systemof safeguards designed to limit foreseeable financial exposure to GSCCand its members that is inherent to the operation of a netting by novationsettlement system.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1 (1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25740 (May 31, 1988),53 FR 19639 (``GSCC Temporary Registration Order'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Netting by novation is the process of replacing a contractbetween two parties by interposing a third party as an intermediary creditor/debtorbetween the two parties. The original contractual obligation is satisfiedand discharged, and replaced by contracts between the third party and eachof the original parties. As applied to GSCC's netting system, this meansthat after the day's trades are netted, the system will substitute GSCCas the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description</ITAG>A. GSCC's Proposed Netting ServiceGSCC proposes to establish a netting and settlement system (``netting system'')for member trades in U.S. Treasury and agency securities for settlementof compared trades submitted by GSCC netting members on a next-day basisin same-day funds. To implement this sytem, GSCC proposes to add threenew rules, which will set forth operational requirements for the systemand the respective rights and obligations of GSCC and its members.\8\<NOTE/> New GSCC Rule 11 generally prescribes the netting process,including the calculation of net positions, the allocation of deliver andreceive obligations and the novation of obligations. New GSCC Rule 12 containsprocedures for the settlement of net positions with GSCC through designatedclearing banks. New GSCC Rule 13 contains procedures for the calculationand payment of funds-only obligations arising out of the netting process.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The proposals also will add or modify several definitionsthat appear in GSCC Rule 1.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Trades Eligible for Netting</ITAG>Only eligible trades will enter the GSCC netting system. A trade is eligiblefor entry into the netting system if it meets all of the following requirements:(1) The trade data has been compared by GSCC and listed on a comparisonreport made available to GSCC netting members,(2) Netting of the trade will occur on or before its contractual settlementdate,(3) Both parties to the trade are netting members \9\<NOTE/> (``members''), and<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ A netting member is a GSCC participant who is a memberof both the comparison and netting systems.(4) The security is an eligible security \10\<NOTE/> for netting purposes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ An eligible netting security is a security that GSCChas designated as eligible for netting. Initially, GSCC will designatecertain Treasury notes as eligible netting securities. Subsequently, GSCCexpects to make eligible U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, and securitiesissued by agencies of the U.S. Government. In addition, following varioussystem enhancements (<T3>see infra, </T3>section IV.B.3), GSCC also expects to make eligiblewhen-issued trades and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principalof Securities (``STRIPS''), which are separate interests in the interestpayments and principal on designated U.S. Treasury long-term bonds andnotes.Netting members must submit each eligible trade for comparison and netting.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Netting Process</ITAG>GSCC will net member trades, for each eligible security with a separateCUSIP number,\11\<NOTE/> by adding together the par amount of each purchase of thatsecurity and the par amount of each sale of that security by a member,resulting in a net long position, if purchases exceed sales; a net shortposition, if sales exceed purchases; and a net flat position, if purchasesequal sales. Once GSCC has calculated each member's delivery obligationson a CUSIP-number by CUSIP-number basis, GSCC will match all net long andshort positions of members on a CUSIP-number by CUSIP-number basis intosets of receive and deliver instructions. Because there may not alwaysbe a net long and short position of equal size, the matching process mayresult in the creation of more than one receive or deliver obligation foreach security with a separate CUSIP number. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ ``CUSIP'' is an acronym for the Committee on UniformSecurities Identification Procedures. The CUSIP numbering system was developedby a committee of the American Bankers Association bearing the same nameand was created to identify specific securities issues. Each eligible nettingsecurity issue has its own separate CUSIP number that GSCC uses in itsnetting system to group trades for the net. On the morning after trade date, members will receive a Funds-Only SettlementReport, a Netted Trade Summary Report and an Open Receive/Deliver OrdersReport. The Funds-Only Settlement Report will show the trade adjustment\1\\2\<NOTE/> for settling positions, any marks-to-the-market owed forfailed positions, \1\\3\<NOTE/> and adjustments for coupon, \1\\4\<NOTE/> margin, \1\\5\<NOTE/> and redemption payments.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The Netted Trade Summary Report will inform members whattrades entered the netting system and what the resulting net is, includingopen positions, and provide them with deliver and receive instructions.The Open Receive/Deliver Orders Report will reflect the novation of thetrades \1\\7\<NOTE/> and the substitution of GSCC as the contra-party to all opennetted positions.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The trade adjustment is the dollar difference betweenthe contract value and the system value of the securities that comprisea net settlement position on settlement date. <T3>See infra,</T3> section IV.B.3, for a description of system value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\<T3> See infra</T3>, section II.A.4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The coupon adjustment reflects interest payments amember either owes or is entitled to receive for securities that comprisea fail net settlement position that remains unsettled over an interestpayment date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ The margin adjustment reflects money due to or owedby GSCC with regard to the cash portion of a member's clearing fund depositor cash collateral deposited by the member with GSCC or a third party custodianacting on behalf of GSCC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ The redemption adjustment reflects the difference betweenthe system value and maturity value for securities that comprise a failnet settlement position that remains unsettled over a maturity date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Novation will occur at the time GSCC makes reportsavailable to GSCC members. Upon novation each member's receive and deliverobligations will be from or to GSCC. The reports will be available whenGSCC has completed its processing cycle for the preparation of such reportsand has released such reports to GSCC's data output facility, generallybetween 4 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time [``e.s.t.'']) and 7 a.m. (e.s.t.)on the morning after trade date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ During the course of its netting program and for GSCC'suse only, GSCC will allocate each member's net delivery obligation to anothermember's obligation to receive securities. The allocation process willpermit GSCC to issue precise instructions to its members and its clearingagent bank concerning the delivery and receipt of securities that the clearingagent bank will receive later in the day during the delivery and paymentprocess. Under GSCC's rules, the allocation process does not modify GSCC'obligation to deliver or receive securities to a netting member or alterthe novation of trades that comprise the net settlement position.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Settlement of Securities and Money Obligations</ITAG>a. <T3>Settlement of Funds-Only Obligations. </T3>GSCC's proposed rules willrequire each member to pay any money obligations, known as ``funds-onlyobligations,'' reflecting trade adjustments for settling positions, marks-to-the-marketfor any fail positions and adjustments necessary to account for interestand redemption payments. Under GSCC's proposed rules, a netting membermust pay GSCC its funds-only settlement obligations, through the fundswire transfer service maintained by the Federal Reserve Banks (``Fed Funds''),by the later of 10:00 a.m. (e.s.t.) on the business day the payment isdue or within two hours after GSCC issues to the member a report detailingthe member's payment obligation. A netting member entitled to collect afunds-only settlement amount will receive Fed Funds by the later of 11:00a.m. (e.s.t.) on the business day when such payment is due or three hoursafter the report listing such obligation is made available to the member.GSCC is required to pay such amount whether or not it collects paymentsowing from any other member. GSCC expects to make the reports availableat or before 7:00 a.m. (e.s.t.) each day.If a netting member fails to pay a funds-only settlement amount in a timelymanner, GSCC may apply to payment of the unpaid balance: (1) All or a portionof any monies owing by GSCC to the member, and (2) all or a portion ofthe member's clearing fund deposit or other collateral. The member willbe liable to GSCC for costs for any borrowing until the unpaid balanceis paid. In addition, GSCC's Board of Directors (``Board'') may discipline(<T3>e.g.,</T3> censure or fine) the member, if the Board determines thatthe failure to pay was done without good cause.\1\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ GSCC proposed Rule 12 defines ``good cause'' in thiscontext to mean a casual event or occurrence that the GSCC Board, in itssole discretion, determines was beyond the reasonable control of the nettingmember. Depending upon the specific circumstances, this may include anextended failure of Fedwire or the inability to gain access to Fedwireby a depository institution acting on behalf of a netting member or GSCC.b. <T3>Settlement of Delivery Obligations. </T3>Settlement of securities obligationsin GSCC's netting system is designed to operate in harmony with currentmethods for safekeeping and transferring Government securities. U.S. Treasurysecurities (bonds, bills, notes and STRIPS \2\\0\<NOTE/>) and several U.S. Government agency securities are issuedexclusively in book-entry form and are recorded in accounts at FederalReserve Banks and member depository institutions. These securities canbe transferred between member depository institutions (free or againstpayment) through the wire transfer service operated by Federal ReserveBanks (``Fedwire''). Thus, GSCC has decided that settlement of net obligationsbetween GSCC and its members in GSCC's system will occur through the movementof securities and funds over the Fedwire.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 10.Consistent with industry practice in the government securities market,settlement of net delivery obligations between each member and GSCC willbe made over Fedwire on the day after trade date. Because GSCC is not,and does not plan to become, a depository institution eligible for directaccess to Fedwire facilities, GSCC will obtain access to Fedwire indirectlythrough designated clearing agent banks acting on its behalf. Members thatdo not have direct access to Fedwire also will use clearing agent banksto hold their book-entry securities and to effect Fedwire deliveries andpayments on their behalf. Settlement will be accomplished through GSCC'sdesignated clearing agent bank, against payment of GSCC's assigned systemvalue for the securities that constitute the net settlement position. \2\\1\<NOTE/> Once reports are made available, each member must providesettlement instructions to its clearing agent bank promptly. The member'sclearing agent bank will then complete settlement with GSCC's designatedclearing agent bank through the simultaneous payment or receipt in FederalFunds at the system value for the eligible netting securities. GSCC willnot be obligated to deliver securities to a net long member until GSCCreceives from a net short member securities with the same CUSIP numberthat are at least equal in quantity to the net long position and that havenot been allocated for delivery to another member.\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Settlement of netted positions will be based on thesystem value of the eligible netting securities. The system value is theproduct of the amount in dollars equal to the par value of each eligiblenetting security in the position multiplied by its system price plus anyinterest that has accrued. The system price is determined for each eligiblenetting security with a separate CUSIP number and is a uniform price, expressedin dollars per unit of par value, not including accrued interest, basedon current market information. Initially, GSCC will calculate the systemprice as the average price of the trades for the day in each separate CUSIPnumber security, taking into account the volume of trades at differenttimes during the trading day. In calculating the system price, GSCC mayexclude trades executed at prices that are far away from the price of mosttrades in that CUSIP number security on the particular trading day.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 18 for a description of GSCC's system for allocatingdeliveries. GSCC may accept a partial delivery of eligible netting securitiesfrom a member with a net short position. GSCC will do so only upon theconsent of a netting member with a net long position with a like amountof such securities. If a partial delivery is accepted, the remaining undeliveredsecurities will constitute a fail net settlement position.GSCC may require netting members to pay or reimburse GSCC for certain financingand other costs that GSCC incurs in operating the netting system. If GSCCis unable to redeliver securities (that GSCC received from a netting memberwith a net short position) to a netting member with a net long position(<T3>e.q.</T3>, because the securities were delivered to GSCC too late inthe day to be redelivered), GSCC may require netting members (<T3>pro rata</T3> based on netting member use of GSCC services) to reimburseGSCC for any costs GSCC incurs as a result of holding the position overnight.GSCC's Board, however, may require a netting member to pay all costs relatedto financing securities held by GSCC overnight if the Board determinesthat the member, without good cause, frequently delivered securities toGSCC within time frames that prevented GSCC from redelivering those securities(<T3>e.g.</T3>, within the last few minutes of the day). \2\\3\<NOTE/> In addition, GSCC may require a netting member to pay allcosts incurred by GSCC where the member has a net long position and failsto take delivery without good cause. \2\\4\<NOTE/> Finally, GSCC may require a member to pay all costs for thedelivery of securities not at the appropriate system value or securitiesthat have not been designated to be delivered to GSCC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 19 for GSCC's proposed definition of ``good cause.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Fails to Deliver and Buy-ins</ITAG>A net settlement position that does not settle on settlement date willbecome a fail (``fail net settlement position''). The fail net settlementposition will be reported daily to the appropriate member in a fail reportuntil the position is settled. Except in the case of an insolvent member,\2\\5\<NOTE/> fail net settlement positions will not be netted with anyother deliver or receive obligations; rather, GSCC will maintain the failnet settlement position until its actual settlement. \2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See infra </T3>section II.B.4 for discussion regarding insolvent members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ GSCC's netting system differs from a continuous netsettlement (``CNS'') system, whereby each member's net position is recalculateddaily, using current net open positions and previous days' fails.GSCC will mark-to-the-market fail net settlement positions \2\\7\<NOTE/> and will include the mark-to-the-market amount \2\\8\<NOTE/> in computing the funds-only payment obligations of nettingmembers (other than inter-dealer brokers). \2\\9\<NOTE/> GSCC will mark fail net settlement positions on a daily basis,using that day's system value. \3\\0\<NOTE/> GSCC will have the discretion, however, not to collect amark-to-the-market for a fail net settlement position where the eligiblenetting securities have been delivered to GSCC but could not be deliveredto another member (<T3>i.e.,</T3> GSCC is holding the securities overnight). \3\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ GSCC will mark each fail net settlement position bydetermining the dollar difference between the fail net settlement position'ssystem value on the current day and its system value on the immediatelyprevious business day. GSCC will calculate the mark each business day inthis manner until the fail net settlement position settles.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ GSCC will match or ``pair-off'' members' net long failpositions and net short fail positions, similar to what is done today bygovernment securities brokers and dealers. Once GSCC has calculated eachmember's receive and deliver obligations on a CUSIP-number by CUSIP-numberbasis, GSCC will then look at each member's fail positions and that day'sreceive and deliver obligations to see if any fails may off-set each otheror if that day's receive or deliver obligations may be paired-off withpreviously failed positions. GSCC will issue a paired-off report to itsmembers and extinguish a member's obligation to deliver or receive suchsecurities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ Under proposed GSCC Rule 1, in order to qualify asan inter-dealer broker, the firm must limit its business <T3>exclusively</T3> to acting as a broker on behalf of other netting membersor persons who could qualify as eligible netting members (<T3>i.e.,</T3> persons who are government securities dealers). GSCC's Boardmay, at any time, review the qualifications of an inter-dealer broker.An inter-dealer broker is a broker that arranges trades among primary andsome aspiring primary dealers. In some cases an inter-dealer broker alsomay trade with dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ <T3>See infra,</T3> section IV.B.3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ This situation may arise when securities are deliveredto GSCC by a member just before the close of the Fedwire and GSCC can notredeliver the securities prior to the Fedwire closing.GSCC's netting system design assumes netting members will complete theirdelivery obligations on a timely basis. GSCC's proposed rules anticipate,however, that circumstances may prevent members from completing their deliveryobligations on a timely basis and that a member who is entitled to receivesecurities might seek to compel delivery from GSCC through delivery ofa buy-in notice not sooner than 30 calendar days after such member hasfailed to receive the securities.\3\\2\<NOTE/> Because GSCC will not maintain an inventory of eligible securities(indeed, GSCC's system is designed to avoid any such positions), GSCC'sproposed rules authorize GSCC to allocate any buy-in notices it receivesfrom a member (``submitting member'') to a netting member (or members)who has failed to deliver securities to GSCC. Generally, GSCC will allocatethe buy-in notice to the netting member or members (``allocated member'')with an open net short position in that CUSIP number equal to or greaterin size than the buy-in position that remains unsettled for the longestperiod of time. Under GSCC's proposed rules, the failure of the allocatedmember to deliver the securities that are subject to a buy-in notice willnot obligate GSCC to execute the buy-in notice (<T3>i.e.</T3>, buy securities to satisfy the delivery obligation); thesubmitting member must buy-in securities. If the submitting member buyssecurities in accordance with its notice, the submitting member must reportits purchase to GSCC and, if requested, document the price it paid forthose securities. Thereafter, GSCC will charge the allocated member forthe price of the securities and will terminate both the submitting member'sand the allocated member's obligations to GSCC with respect to the subjectsecurities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ Under industry custom, a purchaser who has failed toreceive securities from a seller for 30 calendar days following settlementday, may send the seller notice of its intention to close out the positionby buying-in securities. If the seller has not yet delivered securitiesbecause it is waiting for delivery from another party, the seller may retransmitthis buy-in notice to that party. <T3>See</T3> Public Securities Association Guidelines as published in ``GovernmentSecurities Newsletter'' (December 21, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Special Provisions for Inter-Dealer Brokers</ITAG>The netting system and GSCC proposed rules will allow inter-dealer brokers\3\\3\<NOTE/> the choice to exclude, in writing, a trade from the nettingsystem if the trade would result in a net settlement position other thanzero for the inter-dealer broker.\3\\4\<NOTE/> The notice must be submitted to GSCC no less than two businessdays prior to the execution of such trade or trades. Even so, in orderto encourage inter-dealer brokers to leave trades within GSCC's nettingsystem (including trades that may cause an inter-dealer broker not to havea zero net position), GSCC's proposed rules provide that inter-dealer brokerswill not be obligated until the actual settlement of a net settlement positionto pay to GSCC or receive from GSCC the net transaction adjustment payment,\3\\5\<NOTE/>  the net fail mark adjustment payment,\3\\6\<NOTE/> and the coupon adjustment payment.\3\\7\<NOTE/> Under GSCC's shareholder's agreement and proposed rules,GSCC netting members are obligated to reimburse GSCC, <T3>pro rata</T3>, based upon usage for GSCC's financing and other costs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 29.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ This provision is included to cover instances, forexample, where one of the two dealers involved in the trade is not a nettingmember and the inter-dealer broker's position, if left in the netting system,would not net down to zero.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ The net transaction adjustment payment is the net differencebetween the amounts a member is entitled to collect from or deliver toGSCC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ The net fail mark adjustment payment is the net differencebetween the dollar amount of all fail mark adjustment payments a memberis entitled to collect from or deliver to GSCC on a particular businessday. The fail mark adjustment payment is the absolute value of the dollardifference between the system value of a fail net settlement position onthe current business day and the system value of such fail net settlementposition on the immediately previous business day.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 14.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Facilities for Delivery of Securities and Payment of Funds</ITAG>Netting members will be required to maintain arrangements with a clearingagent bank to settle their net settlement obligations. A member must notifyGSCC, at least ten business days prior to becoming a netting member, whichclearing agent bank(s) it has designated to act on its behalf to receiveand deliver eligible netting securities. Any subsequent change in the designationalso must be made at least ten business days in advance. Clearing agentbank designation is subject to GSCC's determination that the clearing agentbank will: (1) Have and maintain Fedwire access, (2) have and maintainthe operational capability to interact satisfactorily with GSCC's clearingbank(s), and (3) agree to act on behalf of the netting member in accordancewith proposed GSCC Rule 12.\3\\8\<NOTE/> A member with direct access to Fedwire may act as its ownclearing agent bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ GSCC proposed Rule 12 sets forth a netting member'ssecurities settlement procedures and obligations.GSCC will maintain arrangements with several clearing agent banks to obtainaccess to Fedwire and complete settlement of member's net settlement obligations.Those arrangements will be governed by a Uniform Clearing Agent Bank Agreement,which GSCC will execute with its clearing agent banks. Under that agreement,the clearing agent bank will deliver and receive securities and funds intoand out of an account maintained for GSCC according to settlement instructionsissued by GSCC. The agreement also obligates the clearing agent bank toguarantee tender of delivery of securities pursuant to GSCC's deliveryinstructions within two minutes after securities have been delivered toGSCC's account. The agreement also provides an undertaking by the clearingagent bank to lend GSCC funds to finance GSCC's intra-day securities deliveryand related payment obligations, as necessary, and to make overnight demandloans to GSCC to finance securities the clearing agent bank received onGSCC's behalf that could not be delivered to a GSCC member before Fedwireclosed. As collateral for such loans, GSCC will grant the clearing agentbank a security interest in the securities and proceeds with respect towhich each loan is made.\3\\9\<NOTE/> The agreement limits the clearing agent bank's liabilityfor errors, acts and omissions in good faith not due to the clearing agentbank's gross negligence or willful misconduct.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ Under GSCC proposed Rule 4, each member will grantto GSCC a first priority perfected security interest in all assets andproperty placed by a member in the possession of GSCC (or its agents actingon its behalf), including all securities and cash on deposit with GSCCin satisfaction of a netting member's required fund deposit or additionalfund deposit as security for any and all of its obligations and liabilities.GSCC is entitled to its rights as a pledgee under common law and as a securedparty under Articles 8 and 9 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code withrespect to such collateral. GSCC maintains a lien on securities that havebeen delivered to it by the selling side of each trade until it receivespayment via Fedwire from the buying side. After GSCC receives payment,it releases the securities to the receiving member.B. Financial SafeguardsGSCC's proposed netting service presents credit and liquidity exposureto GSCC and other members utilizing the system. GSCC will implement a widearray of safeguards, including specific financial and operational standardsfor access to the netting system and clearing fund contribution requirements.In addition, GSCC will monitor the financial condition of its netting membersand will have authority to restrict member access to the netting system.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Membership Standards for Access to Netting</ITAG>Under the proposed rules, GSCC will establish a new category of membershipfor persons using the netting service.\4\\0\<NOTE/> GSCC will require that an applicant for access to the nettingservice be an existing GSCC member who has used GSCC comparison servicefor at least six months prior to applying for access to the netting service.\4\\1\<NOTE/> An applicant for access to the netting service must complywith the operational and financial standards set forth in proposed Rule15. Under this rule, an applicant must possess sufficient personnel andphysical facilities to handle transactions, communicate with GSCC and fulfillits commitments to GSCC. The applicant also must not be subject to a statutorydisqualification \4\\2\<NOTE/> or an order of similar effect issued by a federal or statebanking authority.\4\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ GSCC's proposal will establish new membership categoriesto designate those members using only the comparison service (``comparison-onlymembers,'') members that only provide clearing agent bank services (``clearingagent bank members'') and members that are eligible to use the comparisonand netting services (``netting members''). A clearing agent bank membermay become a netting member if it participates in the netting system onits own behalf or on behalf of a non-member who would be eligible to becomea comparison-only member. Under these circumstances, GSCC will considerthe clearing agent bank member a netting member for purposes of nettingand settling any transactions submitted by the clearing agent bank andwill expect it to satisfy the requirements applicable to any other bankapplicant seeking access to the netting system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ Under GSCC's proposed rules a person may become a comparison-onlymember if: (1) It is a government securities broker or dealer in compliancewith either Section 15, 15 U.S.C. 780 (1981), or Section 15C, 15 U.S.C.780-5 (supp. 1989) of the Act, or (2) it is a clearing agent bank who isobligated to GSCC on behalf of a non-member, or (3) it demonstrates toGSCC's Board that its business and capabilities would allow it to materiallybenefit from direct access to GSCC's services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ <T3>See </T3>section 3(a)(39) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39) (1981).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ In addition, an applicant to the netting membershipmust continue to meet the standards for becoming a comparison-only member.Such standards establish that a person may be disqualified from admissioninto the comparison-only membership if the Board of GSCC has reasonablegrounds to believe that the applicant (or any person associated with theapplicant): (1) Is subject to special or closer than normal surveillanceby its designated examining authority, regulatory agency or self-regulatoryorganization (``SRO''); (2) is subject to an action or condition whichwould subject the applicant, if already a member, to be placed on surveillancestatus by GSCC; (3) has misstated or omitted a material fact in connectionwith its application to become a member; (4) has violated any of the lawsor rules regulating the securities markets or, within the ten years precedingthe filing of the application, has been convicted of certain enumeratedfelonies or misdemeanors; (5) has been permanently enjoined or prohibitedthrough an administrative or judicial order from participating in the securitiesmarkets or has been expelled or suspended from a national securities association,exchange, SRO or clearance and settlement corporation.An applicant for access to the netting service must meet the followingfinancial requirements as of the end of the calendar month prior to theeffective date of its membership:(1) An applicant who is registered with the Commission as a broker or adealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Act (other than an inter-dealer broker)\4\\4\<NOTE/> must have a net worth of at least $50 million and excessnet capital of at least $10 million;<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ Applicants who demonstrate to the Board's satisfactionthat they limit their business to acting exclusively as brokers on behalfof persons that potentially meet the standards for netting membership willbe exempt from these capital requirements. Such inter-dealer brokers, however,must each deposit with GSCC $1.6 million to collateralize their potentialliabilities.(2) An applicant who is registered as a government securities broker orgovernment securities dealer pursuant to Section 15C of the Act (otherthan an inter-dealer broker) must have a net worth of at least $50 millionand excess liquid capital of at least $10 million;(3) An applicant that is a bank chartered under federal or State law musthave a level of equity capital of at least $250 million; and(4) Any other type of entity must meet minimum capital requirements asdetermined by GSCC on an individual basis.An application for membership in the netting system will be reviewed bythe Membership and Standards Committee of the Board (``Committee''). ThisCommittee will make a recommendation to the Board based on a questionnaireand the financial reports and information submitted by the applicant toGSCC. If the Committee issues a recommendation that the Board deny theapplication, GSCC will furnish the applicant with a concise written statementsetting forth the specific grounds for the denial. The applicant may requesta hearing before the Board, which is responsible for determining whetherto approve or disapprove the application.Once an applicant becomes a netting member, it must remain in compliancewith the relevant qualifications or standards for admission to such membership.A failure to meet such standards will prompt a review by the Board of thefinancial condition and operational capacity of the member.\4\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ The Board also may institute such a review whenevera member violates any GSCC rule or procedure or any agreement with GSCC,fails to satisfy in a timely manner any obligation to GSCC, or incurs amaterial change in control or financial condition. Moreover, the Boardmay institute a review of a member upon the occurrence of an event which,in the Board's judgment, adversely affects the investing public, the clearanceand settlement process, GSCC, members, or creditors.If the Board finds that a member has ceased to maintain the relevant standardsestablished by proposed Rule 15, GSCC will notify the member and specifya time period within which the member must comply with such standards.If the member fails to comply within the specified time period, the Boardwill determine whether its membership should continue and, if so, underwhat conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Clearing Fund</ITAG>a. <T3>Required Clearing Fund Contributions. </T3>GSCC's proposed Rule 4,``Clearing Fund and Loss Allocation'', authorizes GSCC to establish a clearingfund and to collect clearing fund contributions from its netting members(except inter-dealer brokers). GSCC will calculate a member's clearingfund contribution requirement based upon the risk to GSCC resulting fromthe member's daily settlement activities. GSCC will require netting members,except inter-dealer brokers, to maintain a minimum clearing fund depositof $100,000 in cash. This deposit must be made by the close of businesson the business day immediately prior to the business day on which theybecome netting members.\4\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ <T3>See</T3> GSCC proposed Rule 4, sections 2 and 9, ``Clearing Fund andLoss Allocation'' and ``Required Fund Deposit and Timing of Payment ofRequired Fund Deposit.''Inter-dealer brokers will not be required to make clearing fund contributionsto GSCC. Instead, the shareholder's agreement and GSCC's rules requireeach inter-dealer broker to submit a collateral deposit of $100,000 incash and an additional deposit of $1.5 million in U.S. Treasury securitiesor letters of credit issued in favor of GSCC.\4\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ As discussed <T3>infra</T3>, at section II.B.6, GSCC will use the collateral depositsfrom inter-dealer brokers and other clearing fund contributions to satisfylosses GSCC incurs. The shareholder's agreement, however, limits inter-dealerbrokers' required contributions to $1.6 million. <T3>See</T3> GSCC proposed Rule 4 section 8, ``Clearing Fund and Loss Allocation,Allocation of Loss or Liability Incurred by the Corporation'' and <T3>infra</T3>, at section II.B.5. ``Loss Allocation and Pro-Rata Assessments.''GSCC will calculate daily each netting member's clearing fund contributionrequirement and determine whether the netting member's deposit exceedsits required clearing fund contribution. Although complex, the formulameasures a netting member's payment and delivery and receive obligationsdue later in the day against the netting member's average payment and deliveryand receive obligations during the previous 20 business days. Accordingly,the formula contains two components_payment obligations and securitiesnet settlement obligations_and each of those components in turn containstwo subcomponents_one subcomponent measures the netting member's averageobligations during the previous 20 business days and the second subcomponentreflects the netting member's obligations to be settled later that day.In general, GSCC uses the largest figure as each member's clearing fundrequirement to address the risk posed by the member's activities. A fulldiscussion of the clearing fund calculation follows. The first component (``funds-only settlement'') measures all of the nettingmember's funds-only settlement obligations to GSCC. This includes, amongother things, securities clearing differences, transactions adjustmentpayments, coupon adjustment payments and marks-to-the market. The firstsubcomponent (``weighted rolling average'') \4\\8\<NOTE/> is equal to 125% of the absolute value of the netting member's\4\\9\<NOTE/> average funds-only settlement obligation for the previous20 business days. The second subcomponent (``anticipated funds-only settlementobligation'') is the netting member's funds-only settlement obligationdue at 10 AM (EST) that day. If the second subcomponent (the netting member'santicipated funds-only settlement obligation) exceeds the first subcomponent(the netting member's weighted rolling average) by 25% or more, GSCC willuse the second subcomponent (the anticipated funds-only settlement obligation)as the funds-only settlement component in the clearing fund deposit calculation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ GSCC's proposed rules authorize GSCC to place greaterweight on more recent days within the 20 business days. Initially, GSCCwill use a weighting factor of one for each day but plans to monitor the20 day average to determine if and what type of weighting factor is necessaryto better reflect the risk to GSCC with regard to funds-only settlements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ The absolute value is used to reflect the fact thatGSCC is at risk both when it is owed funds by a member and when it haspaid out funds to a member that are required to be returned when settlementof the trade to which the funds movement is related is made.The second component (``securities settlement'') measures the netting member'ssecurities settlement obligations to GSCC. This includes the absolute valueof the total dollar amount of the netting member's daily net settlement(delivery and receive) obligation in each security issue eligible for GSCC'snetting system, grouped by product and within each product, by maturityranges. It also is composed of two subcomponents. The first subcomponent(``weighted rolling average securities settlement'') is the average absolutevalue of the total dollar amount of the netting member's securities settlementposition in each security issue (deliver and receive) during the previous20 business days in each maturity range within each product group. GSCCwill not net securities positions within maturity ranges or product groups.GSCC will then multiply the weighted rolling average securities settlementtimes a margin factor (described below) to obtain the total figure forthe first subcomponent. GSCC has established a margin factor for each maturity range within eachproduct group. That factor is a percentage, which is generally designedto measure the potential volatility of prices in that maturity range, amongother things, based on GSCC's review of average daily government securitiesprice volatility data for the period encompassing the first quarter of1988 through the first quarter of 1989. In addition, on June 30, 1989,GSCC amended the proposed rule change (SR-GSCC-89-5) to specify the currentmargin factors, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Margin Factors for Bills, Notes and the 30-year Bond</T4><H1>Time to maturity </H1><H1>Percentage factor</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 day through 3 months <D>0.040</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 months plus 1 day through 6 months <D>0.080</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 months plus 1 day through 1 year <D>0.125</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1 year plus 1 day through 2 years <D>0.250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 years plus 1 day through 4 years <D>0.500</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 years plus 1 day through 5 years <D>0.625</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 years plus 1 day through 7 years <D>0.750</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 years plus 1 day through 10 years <D>0.935</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 years plus 1 day through 30 years <D>1.450</D></ITAG></ITAG>GSCC's proposed rules authorize GSCC to change, among other things, themargin factor for any maturity range, to change the maturity ranges, andto use a revised factor after 10 days notice to netting members.\5\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\As amended on June 29, 1989, GSCC's proposed rules wouldauthorize GSCC's Board of Directors to increase one or more percentagescomprising the margin factor upon a determination that such an increaseis appropriate in view of market experience and conditions. The amendedrules also would authorize GSCC to decrease one or more percentages comprisingthe margin factor upon submission and review of a proposed rule changepursuant to section 9(b)(2) of the Act. The amended proposed rules alsowould authorize the Board to waive the requirement that members must receive10 days notice before the effective date of a change in margin factorsif the Board determines market conditions warrant such action.The second subcomponent (``current securities settlement position'') isthe absolute value of the total dollar amount of the netting member's positionin each security issue that is due to settle later that day. GSCC willmultiply the absolute value of the total dollar amount of the anticipatednet securities settlement position in each maturity range within each productgroup by the same margin factors as applied to the weighted rolling averagesecurities settlement subcomponent. GSCC will use the current securitiessettlement position if the total absolute dollar value of current securitiessettlement positions exceeds, by 25% or more, the total absolute dollarvalue of the netting member's weighted rolling average net settlement positions.In addition, a separate further calculation of a netting member's clearingfund contribution requirement will compare the sum of the funds-only settlementcomponent and the securities settlement component, as determined above,to the result if the anticipated funds-only settlement obligation subcomponentand the current securities settlement position subcomponent were used tocalculate the required clearing fund contribution. If the netting member'spayment and delivery obligations resulting from trades in the netting systemfor settlement later in the day are substantially greater than the nettingmember's average settlement activity during the previous 20 business days(<T3>i.e., </T3>the sum of the anticipated funds-only settlement obligationsubcomponent and the current securities settlement position subcomponentis more than 125% of the sum of the funds-only settlement component andthe securities settlement component as calculated above), the netting member'sclearing fund requirement will be based on the netting member's currentsettlement and payment obligations (<T3>i.e., </T3>the sum of the anticipated funds-only settlement obligationsubcomponent and the current securities settlement position subcomponent).\5\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\In other words, for example, even if the anticipatedfunds-only settlement obligation subcomponent only was 15% greater thanthe weighted rolling average subcomponent (and, therefore, normally theweighted rolling averge would be used in computing the funds-only settlementcomponent), but the current securities settlement position subcomponentsubstantially exceeded the weighted rolling average securities settlementsubcomponent (<T3>e.g., </T3>45%) such that the sum of anticipated funds-only settlementsubcomponent and the current net securities settlement subcomponent wouldexceed by 125% the contribution otherwise required, than the anticipatedfunds-only settlement subcomponent (rather than the weighted rolling averagesubcomponent) will be used to calculate the funds-only settlement component.Having calculated each netting member's clearing fund contribution requirement,\52\<NOTE/> GSCC then will determine whether the netting member's clearingfund requirement exceeds its current deposit.\53\<NOTE/> GSCC's rules specify a wide range of time frames within whicha netting member must satisfy a deficient deposit, depending on the amountof the deficiency and whether GSCC has placed the netting member on surveillancestatus. If the deficiency exceeds 25% of the netting member's current deposit,the netting member must increase its deposit to eliminate the deficiencyby the close of business on the day after GSCC notifies the netting memberof the deficiency. If the deficiency is more than 10%, but less than 25%of the netting member's current deposit, the netting member must increaseits deposit, to eliminate the deficiency, by the close on the third businessday after GSCC notifies the netting member of the deficiency. Finally,if the netting member has been placed on surveillance status, any deficiencymust be cured by the close of business on the same day GSCC notifies thenetting member of a deficiency. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ GSCC's proposed rules provide GSCC with the discretionto require members, excluding inter-dealer broker members, who are placedon surveillance status to make and maintain an additional deposit to theclearing fund of up to 200% of its highest single business day's requiredclearing fund deposit during the most recent 20 business days, or suchhigher amount as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of GSCCand its members. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ A netting member's clearing fund deposit may exceed itsrequired contribution. Within five business days after the end of eachcalendar month, GSCC will make available to each netting member a clearingfund detail report that lists the form and dollar value of such member'sdeposits to the clearing fund and the amount of the member's required funddeposit and the amount of any additional fund deposit requirement. If GSCCdetermines at the end of any calendar quarter that the amount depositedin the clearing fund is in excess of its required fund deposit, GSCC shall,within 15 business days after such determination, notify the member ofits excess clearing fund contribution. Upon the member's request, GSCCwill return the excess, unless returning the excess would produce the resultthat letters of credit would constitute more than 70% of the member's funddeposit. If the member has an outstanding payment obligation to GSCC, however,GSCC may elect not to return the excess. GSCC also may retain the excessif it determines that the member's anticipated funds-only settlement amountsor net settlement positions over the next 90 calendar days reasonably maybe expected to be materially different than during the prior 90 calendardays, or if the member is on surveillance status. b. <T3>Assets That May be Deposited to Meet Clearing Fund Requirements andUse of Clearing Fund Assets. </T3>The proposal allows each member to meetits clearing fund contribution through deposits of a combination of cash,securities, and letters of credit. Each netting member must deposit a minimumcash contribution of the greater of $100,000 or 10% of the total amountof the required clearing fund deposit, up to a maximum of $500,000.\54\<NOTE/> To satisfy the remainder of the required clearing fund contribution,each member may deposit U.S. Treasury securities (bonds, bills and notes)with dates to maturity of less than one year.\55\<NOTE/> Each member also may deposit irrevocable letters of creditfrom an issuer acceptable to GSCC,\56\<NOTE/> payable to the order of GSCC to meet the remainder of therequired clearing fund deposit. Letters of credit, however, may not comprisemore than 70% of a netting member's clearing fund requirement.\57\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ GSCC proposed Rule 4, section 2(a)(ii). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ The proposal authorizes GSCC's Board to designate otherissues of securities as acceptable collateral to satisfy a member clearingfund obligations and to establish a haircut for valuation purposes. GSCCwill file such proposals to expand the list of eligible securities andthe associated haircuts with the Commission as proposed rule changes undersection 19(b)(2) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ GSCC has established standards for letters of creditissuers that are essentially the same as the National Securities ClearingCorporation's (``NSCC'') standards. Like NSCC, GSCC has established qualificationstandards which potential letters of credit issuers must meet; standardletters of credit agreements between GSCC and the potential issuer; standardletters of credit forms setting forth the terms of each letter of credit;limits on the total amount of funds represented by letters of credit whichNSCC will accept from any one issuer, and standards for the expirationor revocation of letters of credit. GSCC also will establish a list ofapproved banks and trust companies that GSCC will accept as letters ofcredit issuers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ GSCC will deduct 1% from the stated value of lettersof credit in calculating the current value of clearing fund deposits. Inaddition, GSCC only will accept letters of credit from issuers that meetits financial standards. GSCC will value member deposits of securities daily, based on their currentmarket value, as determined by GSCC's system price. Any interest on thesesecurities GSCC receives will be credited to the member's cash depositsto the clearing fund, unless the member has defaulted on its payment obligationsto GSCC. In such cases, GSCC may liquidate the securities and apply theproceeds and the interest to satisfy the member's obligations to GSCC.GSCC's proposed rules will limit the use of the clearing fund to satisfyingGSCC's losses or liabilities arising from the failure of a netting memberto satisfy an obligation to GSCC or any other loss or liability GSCC incursincident to GSCC's clearance and settlement activities. GSCC's proposedrules authorize GSCC to use clearing fund deposits as a source of collateralto meet its temporary financing needs,\58\<NOTE/> including, among other things, financing funds-only paymentdefaults and GSCC's overnight inventory resulting from end-of-day deliveriesthat could not be turned-around.\59\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ As amended on June 29, 1989, GSCC will allocate, <T3>pro rata, </T3>the amount of any pledge, loan or use of clearing fundassets outstanding for more than thirty days according to the allocationscheme in GSCC proposed Rule 4, section 8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Cash in the clearing fund may be partially or whollyinvested in securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interestby the U.S., or U.S. agencies or instrumentalities, repurchase agreementsrelating to such securities, or certificates of deposit or accounts inbanks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or otherwisepursuant to the investment policy adopted by GSCC. Investment income fromcash deposits will accrue to GSCC, until and unless the Board permits paymentsof such investment income to netting members. Upon such a determination,investment income from cash deposits, if any, less an amount to compensateGSCC for its handling costs, will be paid to members no less frequentlythan quarterly. Any securities, repurchase agreements, cash deposits, orother instruments involving the investment of cash deposits, and any securitiesor letters of credit pledged or deposited by any member to secure an openaccount indebtedness to the clearing fund, may be pledged by GSCC as securityfor loans made to it. If a GSCC loss or liability is allocated to a member pursuant to proposedRule 4, section 8 (Allocation of Loss or Liability Incurred by the Corporation),GSCC may apply the portion of that member's deposit to the clearing fundnecessary to satisfy the allocation. GSCC may use any cash, draw againstany letters of credit, and liquidate any securities deposited by the memberin the clearing fund. If the defaulting member's clearing fund contributionis insufficient to satisfy the loss, GSCC may use the remainder of theclearing fund (which is comprised of the other members' clearing fund contributions)as collateral for a loan to satisfy the loss or may use it directly tosatisfy the loss.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Monitoring of Member's Financial Condition</ITAG>As discussed above, members must remain in compliance with GSCC's financialand operational membership standards. GSCC will require its members tosubmit certain financial reports.\60\<NOTE/> In addition, GSCC through NSCC's surveillance department,has developed a number of analytical reports which will allow GSCC to monitormembers' possession and dollar exposure to GSCC. GSCC will perform dailysurveillance based on its own records of the member's activity to obtaina snapshot of the member's financial position. For example, GSCC aggregatesthe member's positions to determine the member's total exposure, beforeand after netting, and compares its exposure with its prior exposures todetermine whether its current total exposure is consistent with its pastexposure or is significantly higher, thus indicating potentially increasedrisks. GSCC also will monitor changes in the mix of a member's securitiesportfolio as well as its trade adjustment payments and will compare thosechanges to its prior securities portfolio and prior trade adjustment paymentsfor significant increases that may indicate potentially increased risksto GSCC. Moreover, GSCC monitors a member's fails by size age and the netdollar amount of those fails to determine if the fails pose a risk to thesystem. Further, GSCC has established informal relationships with otherclearing agencies, SROs, and appropriate banking regulatory authorities,through its relationship with NSCC, in order to obtain relevant financialinformation concerning its members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See,</T3> GSCC proposed Rule 2, section 4.GSCC has developed mandatory\61\<NOTE/> and non-mandatory\62\<NOTE/> factors to determine the circumstances under which GSCC mayplace a member on surveillance. Once GSCC has determined to place a memberon surveillance, GSCC may impose certain restrictions. These restrictionsinclude, among others, the ability to restrict a member's access to netting,for certain products or for all netting services, if upon review of themember's financial position GSCC believes that such restrictions are necessaryto protect GSCC and its members. GSCC may require a member on surveillance,other than inter-dealer brokers, to make additional clearing fund depositsof up to 200% of its required clearing fund contribution.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ The mandatory factors which require GSCC to place a member,including an inter-dealer broker, under surveillance are as follows. GSCCwill examine each member's capital position and place a member under surveillancestatus if any element of a member's capital position falls below that whichwould be required in Rule 15 if it were applying to become a netting member.GSCC will place a broker, dealer, government securities broker or governmentsecurities dealer on surveillance status if it incurs a net loss for (1)the prior calendar month equal to 15% or more of its excess net capitalor excess liquid capital, calculated as of the last day of the immediatelypreceding calendar month period, (2) the prior two-calendar month periodequal to 25% or more of its excess net capital or excess liquid capital,calculated as of the last day of the next prior calendar month, or (3)the prior three-calendar month period equal to 30% or more of its excessnet capital or excess liquid capital, calculated as of the last day ofthe immediately preceding calendar month.<ITAG tagnum="28">GSCC also will place a member on surveillance: (1) If the member temporarilyexperiences either an inability to meet its money settlement obligationsto GSCC in a timely fashion or another significant cash flow problem; (2)if the member temporarily experiences an inability to meet its securitiessettlement obligations in a timely fashion; (3) if the member experiencesa significant reorganization or change in control or management of themember that, in the judgment of the Board, is likely to impair the member'sability to meet its money settlement obligations or securities settlementobligations to GSCC; (4) or if the member has been placed on a specialsurveillance status by another self-regulatory organization (``SRO'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\The non-mandatory factors which GSCC uses to determinewhether to place a member on surveillance status are as follows: (1) Ifthe member temporarily experiences a significant operational problem; (2)if any member's daily funds-only settlement amount or net settlement positionis significantly disproportionate to its usual activity, in light of currentindustry conditions; (3) if it is a depository institution which incursa loss for any of the prior three fiscal quarters; (4) if GSCC receivesa notification from a member's designated examining authority or appropriateregulatory agency of a pending administrative action regarding, or investigationof, the member that could call into question the member's ability to meetits obligations to the corporation; (5) if it experiences any conditionthat could materially affect its financial or operational capability soas to potentially increase GSCC's exposure to loss or liability.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Authority to Restrict Access to Netting, Ceasing To Act for Membersand Member Insolvencies</ITAG>The proposal authorizes GSCC to act for a member under certain enumeratedcircumstances \63\<NOTE/> and requires GSCC to cease to act for a member who is insolvent.\64\<NOTE/> Under proposed Rule 18, GSCC may cease to provide any memberwith any service provided by GSCC or cease to act for any member with respectto a particular transaction, or transactions, or with respect to all ofa member's transactions.\65\<NOTE/> Proposed Rule 18 also provides that members will be notifiedof GSCC's decision to cease to act for them, and of their right to appealsuch a decision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ The Board may cease to act for a member if, in its solediscretion, it has reasonable grounds to believe that ceasing to act isappropriate either for the protection of itself or other members to facilitatethe orderly and continuous performance of GSCC's services. Proposed Rule18 also states that GSCC may cease to act for a member if the Board determinesthat the member: (1) Has failed to perform any of its obligations to GSCCarising under these rules or under the procedures or has materially violatedany rule, procedure, or agreement with GSCC; (2) has failed to make anyrequired payment or deposit provided for in the rules or procedures, includingany fee, fine, or other charge to GSCC in a timely manner; (3) is no longerin compliance with any provision of the admission standards provided inproposed Rule 15 that would be applicable to it, if it were an applicantfor membership, or the continuance standards provided in proposed Rule15 applicable to it. Further, the Board may cease to act for a member ifit has determined that it has reasonable grounds to believe that: (1) Themember, or any associated person, has been responsible for fraudulent ordishonest conduct or breach of fiduciary duty or has made a material misstatementor omitted to state a material fact in any statement to GSCC or to anyofficer or employee of GSCC in connection with its application to becomea member, or thereafter, in connection with any transaction processed orservice furnished by GSCC; or (2) the member is currently experiencing,or is approaching significant financial or operational difficulty or otherwisewill be unable to meet its obligations to GSCC. In determining whetherto cease to act for a member, the Board may determine that adequate causefor ceasing to act does not exist, that such standards, as applied to amember or associated person, are unduly or disproportionately severe; orthat the conduct of the member or associated person has been such as notto make it against the interests of GSCC, other members, or the publicfor GSCC to continue to act for such member, and thus, may allow such memberaccess to GSCC services either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporaryor other conditional basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ GSCC's proposed Rule 20 specifies five events that wouldrequire GSCC to treat such a member as if it were insolvent: (1) Receiptof notification of insolvency renders a member insolvent, unless it postsan appropriate guarantee; (2) The member is determined to be insolventby the Board, or by any Designated Examining Authority or Appropriate RegulatoryAgency with jurisdiction over such member or any SRO; (3) If the memberis a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, and a courtfinds that it meets any one of the conditions for insolvency set forthin the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. andSection;78aaa <T3>et seq</T3>. (1981)); (4) If the member receives a decree or orderby a court adjudging the member as bankrupt or insolvent; approving a petitionseeking reorganization, liquidation, or dissolution under the BankruptcyCode or any other applicable federal or state law; appointing a receiver,liquidator, or trustee for the member, or ordering the winding up or liquidationof its affairs; (5) If the member files a petition seeking reorganizationor relief under the Bankruptcy Code or other federal or state law, or consentsto the filing of such a bankruptcy petition, or to the appointment of areceiver, liquidator, or trustee, or makes an assignment for the benefitof its creditors, or if it admits in writing that it is unable to pay itsdebts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ For example, GSCC has stated that it generally expectsto use its ability to exclude a particular transaction from netting whena participant has attempted to submit non-GSCC-eligible trades for settlement,(<T3>e.g., </T3>the redelivery of securities to satisfy a repurchase agreementor to satisfy a securities delivery obligation resulting from the exerciseof an option agreement). GSCC generally expects to use its authority tocease to act for a particular transaction to remove a trade from nettingin the event a member, whose business is being closed-out and who onlyis permitted to submit trades through GSCC to become ``flat'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>purchasing securities to eliminate short positions and sellingsecurities to eliminate long positions) submits trades which are made forother purposes.When GSCC ceases to act for a member, GSCC's rules require GSCC to notifythe member promptly of its decision to cease to act and provide the memberwith a statement of the grounds for its decision and notice of the member'sright to request a hearing, pursuant to GSCC Rule 37. If the member sorequests, GSCC must hold a hearing as promptly as possible. GSCC will promptlyprepare a written report of any action taken pursuant to proposed GSCCRule 18 and will file the report as part of GSCC's records and with theCommission.GSCC will notify all members promptly that it has ceased to act for a member.\66\<NOTE/> This notice will identify the transaction or transactionsconcerned and will state how the transaction(s) will be affected and whatsteps GSCC will take in view of its ceasing to act. When GSCC has ceasedto act for a member with respect to a particular transaction or transactions,or with respect to all transactions, it will decline to accept or processdata from that member, or from other members with regard to that particulartransaction or transactions, or any transactions with which the memberis a party, unless the Board determines otherwise in order to promote anorderly settlement process.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ After GSCC has ceased to act for a member, GSCC willnevertheless retain the same rights and remedies with respect to any moniesor securities due from the member, or any liability incurred as the resultof such member's action, or on behalf of the member, as though GSCC hadnot ceased to act for it.Generally, GSCC will take the following actions with respect to an insolventmember. GSCC will delete all trade data it receives from the insolventmember with regard to transactions to which it is a party that have notbeen reported by GSCC as compared from the comparison system; and GSCCwill exclude from netting any trades made by the insolvent member whichhave been reported as compared, but which have not been reported by GSCCas included in a net settlement position, unless the Board determines thatthese trades should be included in order to promote an orderly settlementprocess. All long and short net settlement positions of the insolvent member,outstanding at the time of insolvency, will be closed out by establishinga final net settlement position for each security that will be equal tothe net of all outstanding deliver and receive obligations of the insolventmember in each security, including those that arise from net settlementpositions that have failed to settle on their scheduled settlement date,and by buying-in or selling out the securities deliverable by or to theinsolvent member in order to close out the final net settlement positionestablished for each security. GSCC will complete the close out procedurewithin 30 calendar days after GSCC has given its members notice that itwill treat the member as an insolvent member, unless the Board determinesthat the immediate close out of positions in a security may be disadvantageousto GSCC or may promote a disorderly market in that security, in which caseGSCC must obtain Commission approval to suspend the operation of the close-outprovision for more than 30 days.\6\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\<T3>See </T3>Letter to Ester Saverson, Jr., Branch Chief, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, from Jeffrey F. Ingber, Associate General Counsel, GSCC,dated June 29, 1989, amending GSCC proposed Rule 20, section 4(c). If GSCC incurs a loss or liability as a result of closing out an insolventmember's final net settlement positions, the loss or liability will beallocated as provided in GSCC Rule 4. If GSCC makes a profit as a resultof closing-out an insolvent member's final net settlement positions, thisprofit will be credited to the insolvent member, or his appointed legalrepresentative. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Loss Allocation and Assessment Provisions </ITAG>GSCC will employ a variety of loss allocation schemes depending on thesource and the amount of the loss or liability it incurs. As discussedbelow, GSCC's loss allocation methods vary according to the nature of theevent giving rise to the loss. If GSCC incurs a loss or liability resulting from one or more netting members'failure to fulfill their obligations to GSCC, GSCC will look to those members'clearing fund deposits and other collateral held by GSCC to satisfy theloss. If the value of the defaulting members' deposits and other collateralis insufficient to satisfy the loss, GSCC will allocate the remaining amountof the loss (``Remaining Loss'') among the netting members in accordancewith proposed GSCC Rule 4, section 8. In allocating any Remaining Loss, GSCC will determine the amount of theRemaining Loss attributable to direct transactions\6\\8\<NOTE/> and the amount of the Remaining Loss attributable to brokeredtransactions.\69\<NOTE/> The Remaining Loss attributable to direct transactions willbe allocated to the netting members (except for inter-dealer brokers) thathad trading activity with the defaulting member for settlement on the dayof default,\7\\0\<NOTE/> on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis, based on the dollar value of such trading activityof each netting member with the defaulting member. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\A direct transaction is a transaction submitted to GSCCfor settlement by the parties to the trade. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\9\A brokered transaction is a transaction which an inter-dealerbroker has submitted to GSCC for comparison and/or settlement that involvesboth a netting member (or eligible applicant) on the buy side and a nettingmember (or eligible applicant) on the sell side regardless of whether ornot such netting members have submitted data that compares with the datasubmitted by such inter-dealer broker. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\0\The term ``activity for settlement on the day of default''used above will mean trading activity with a defaulting member transactedby a netting member on the business day immediately prior to the businessday on which the failure of the defaulting member to fulfill its obligationsto GSCC occurred, except that, if the level of trading activity of nettingmembers with a defaulting member for settlement on the day of default,measured by the dollar value of securities traded, is less than the dollarvalue amount of the securities of the defaulting member that are liquidatedpursuant to GSCC's close-out procedures, ``activity for settlement on theday of default'' will mean trading activity with a defaulting member transactedon that number of business days immediately prior to the business day onwhich the failure of the defaulting member to fulfill its obligations toGSCC occurred such that the dollar value amount of such trading activityis equal to or greater than the dollar value amount of such liquidatedsecurities. The Remaining Loss attributable to brokered transactions will be allocatedin the following manner. GSCC will allocate to inter-dealer brokers, asa group, 10% of such Remaining Loss, regardless of the level of activityeach inter-dealer broker had with the defaulting member for settlementon the day of default. This allocation, however, is subject to a $1.6 millionper broker, per calendar year, cap. The balance of such Remaining Losswill be allocated among other netting members on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis according to the dollar value of each members'trading activity through inter-dealer brokers for settlement on the dayof default with the defaulting member. Where a netting member defaults on a required allocation assessment orwhere GSCC suffers a loss arising out of events unrelated to a member failure,GSCC will employ a separate allocation procedure. To satisfy such a loss,GSCC first will apply 25% of its retained earnings, or such greater percentagethereof as the Board determines to be appropriate, to satisfy the loss.If such amount is insufficient to satisfy the loss, GSCC will apply upto $50,000 from each netting member's required cash deposit (or, in thecase of an inter-dealer broker, the cash deposit required to be maintainedby such broker with GSCC) equally among all netting members. If the lossstill remains unsatisfied, GSCC will apply the remainder of each nettingmember's required clearing fund deposit (or, in the case of an inter-dealerbroker, of the collateral deposit, including securities and letters ofcredit maintained by such broker with GSCC) on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis in accordance with the average daily level of suchdeposits or collateral over the prior 12 calendar months.\7\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\1\To illustrate how GSCC's loss allocation provisionsoperate, assume that GSCC suffered a $10,500,000 loss or liability as aresult of a member's insolvency. Assume also that the member had $500,000on deposit in GSCC's clearing fund and the member had no other assets thatwere available to meet its obligations to GSCC. GSCC will apply the members'clearing fund deposit to satisfy a portion of the loss. GSCC will allocatethe remaining $10,000,000 loss not covered by the defaulting member's assets,including the member's clearing fund deposit and other collateral at GSCCin the following manner. Assuming that the loss resulted entirely frombrokered transactions, the inter-dealer brokers, as a group, would be responsiblefor 10% or $1,000,000 of the loss. If there were only two inter-dealerbroker netting members, and even if only one of the two had trading activitywith the insolvent member for settlement on the day of default, each inter-dealerbroker would be equally responsible for the portion of the loss allocatedto the inter-dealer brokers and would pay $500,000 to GSCC. <ITAG tagnum="28">The remaining $9,000,000 loss will be allocated among the non-inter-dealerbroker netting members who traded with the insolvent member based on theirlevel of activity with the insolvent member. Assume that member </ITAG><T3>Y, </T3>with a clearing fund deposit of $6,400,000, was the <T3>contra </T3>party to half the trades and that member <T3>Z, </T3>with a clearing fund deposit of $2,500,000, was the <T3>contra </T3>party to the other half of the trades. Each member willowe GSCC $4,500,000. Assuming that each member will satisfy its obligationout of its clearing fund deposit, <T3>Z </T3>will still owe GSCC $2,000,000. If <T3>Z </T3>refuses to pay or is unable to pay, GSCC will cease to act for<T3>Z, </T3>will treat <T3>Z </T3>as if it elected to terminate its membership and sue <T3>Z </T3>to recover the $2,000,000. <ITAG tagnum="28">GSCC will allocate the $2,000,000 loss resulting from </ITAG><T3>Z'</T3>s allocation default by first applying 25% of its existing retainedearnings (or a greater percentage, as the Board may decide) toward suchloss. Assuming that GSCC has $400,000 of existing retained earnings andapplies 25% of such earnings to cover the loss, GSCC will still have a$1,900,000 loss outstanding. GSCC then will apply up to $50,000 of eachremaining netting member's required cash deposit equally among all suchmembers. Assuming that there are a total of ten remaining netting members,GSCC will collect $500,000 from such members. To satisfy the remaining$1,400,000 loss, GSCC will look to the aggregate deposits of all nettingmembers, including inter-dealer brokers, <T3>pro rata, </T3>based on the average daily level of each member's depositsover the prior twelve calendar months.   <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Member Liability for Loss Allocations </ITAG>GSCC's proposed rules provide that the entire amount of a netting member'srequired fund deposit may be used to satisfy the amount of any loss allocatedto any such member. If such amount is not sufficient to satisfy the fullamount of any such loss allocation, GSCC's rules provide that such membermust promptly deliver the amount necessary to eliminate any such deficiency.A netting member (other than an inter-dealer broker, whose liability iscapped at $1.6 million per calendar year) who actively traded with thedefaulting member for settlement on the day of default is liable for thefull amount of its allocated portion of GSCC's losses. A member who hadno trading activity with the defaulting member for settlement on the dayof default, however, may limit its liability for the losses allocated toit by GSCC to the amount of its required fund deposit by electing to withdrawfrom GSCC in a timely manner. Once GSCC has notified a netting member that a loss has been allocatedto such member, and that the amount of such member's required fund depositis not sufficient to cover such allocation, such member must deliver toGSCC by the close of the next business day, or, if the Board so determines,by the close of the business day of issuance of such notification, theamount necessary to eliminate such deficiency. With respect to an allocationarising from a loss where the netting member had no trading activity withthe defaulting member for settlement on the day of default, a member mayavoid further liability for such an allocation by providing GSCC, by theclose of business on the business day on which its payment is due, a writtennotice of the member's election to terminate its membership in GSCC.\7\\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\After a member terminates its membership, or if themember fails to take any action, GSCC will make an additional assessmentagainst the remaining netting members on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis, according to the size of the initial assessment,to cover the amount not paid by the netting member who terminated its GSCCmembership. After the loss has been satisfied, if the amount of funds depositedto fulfill any remaining netting member's clearing fund requirement isinsufficient, GSCC will request the member to deposit the appropriate amountwith GSCC. GSCC's proposed rules permit it to impose sanctions against members whofail to act in accordance with the allocation rules. If a member failsto deliver funds or fails to notify GSCC of its intent to terminate itsmembership, GSCC will cease to act on behalf of such member pursuant toproposed Rule 18 and may take appropriate action, including initiatinglegal action to recover any funds owed or imposing disciplinary actionagainst the member pursuant to GSCC Rule 48. Moreover, a member that electsto terminate its membership will not be eligible to re-apply to becomea comparison-only member or a netting member of GSCC unless it pays GSCCthe amount previously allocated to it plus interest on such amount at theFederal Funds rate plus one percent, calculated from the date on whichthe loss was incurred until the date of payment. In the event GSCC suffers a loss resulting in an assessment to members,GSCC will promptly notify the Commission of the amount of such loss andthe reasons for the loss. If GSCC later recovers all or part of the loss,such amount shall be credited or paid to the members against whom the losswas charged in proportion to the amounts they paid, regardless of whetherthey are still members of GSCC. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Ceasing to be a Member </ITAG>If a netting member, including an inter-dealer broker, notifies GSCC ofits intention to terminate its membership in GSCC, the member's depositsto the clearing fund in the form of cash and securities will be returnedto it within 30 calendar days and its deposits in the form of letters ofcredit will be returned within 90 calendar days, unless the member hasan outstanding unpaid obligation to GSCC or an open net settlement position.The termination of membership will not affect any outstanding obligationof a member to GSCC. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. GSCC's Rationale for the Proposed Rule Changes   </ITAG>GSCC believes that the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirementsof Section 17A of the Act. Specifically, GSCC believes that its nettingsystem will promote the prompt and accurate settlement of government securitiesby reducing money payment and securities receive and delivery obligationsof compared trades among GSCC members. In addition, GSCC states that nettingwill substantially reduce the number of Fedwire payment and securitiesmovements by GSCC members. Moreover, the proposed system would reduce costsand promote the efficient utilization of the market's resources by facilitatingthe timely collection and processing of data. GSCC also believes that the netting process and the associated financialand operational safeguards provide GSCC with the capacity to safeguardsecurities and funds in its custody or control or for which it has responsibility.GSCC also believes that the proposal would help ensure an orderly clearanceand settlement process by providing the level of surveillance necessaryto ensure that members adhere to its rules and by pointing out any financialor operational problems among its members that could create an unreasonablerisk for the rest of the membership. In addition, GSCC stated that themarks-to-the-market and the clearing fund provide additional safeguardsthat minimize the risk to market participants and promote stability inthe government securities market. GSCC notes that the proposed system wouldenable it to keep track, on a daily basis, of each net position that failsto settle and would assist its members' efforts to assess their positionwithin the government securities market by automatically revaluing a member'snet fail positions each business day to a price that is current as of theend of the prior business day. Finally, GSCC notes that it does not believethat the proposed rule changes will have an impact on, or impose a burdenon competition. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>Sections 17A(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency beso organized and that its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsibleand to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or forwhich it is responsible. GSCC's netting system provides an effective meansto reduce member's settlement obligations, thereby, offering a significantreduction in risk to the market place. GSCC also has designed a numberof safeguards, including marks-to-the-market, securities against paymentthrough the Fedwire, the clearing fund, and a required deposit by inter-deale2brokers, that are designed to reduce the risk associated with netting andsettlement to GSCC and its members. A. Prompt and Accurate Clearance and Settlement Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that a clearing agency be so organized andthat its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible.As discussed below, the Commission believes that GSCC meets the requirementsof section 17A(b)(3)(F). The market for government securities is the largest by dollar volume inthe U.S. Outstanding U.S. Treasury Securities issues exceeded $1.8 trillion,with the daily average trading volume in excess of $100 billion by theend of 1988. The size and value of the trading in government securitiescreates potential exposure for market participants if a delivery of securitiesis late or if the Fedwire is temporarily non-operational. Thus, providingeffective means to reduce government securities participants' settlementobligations may offer significant reductions in risks to the marketplace.The benefits of GSCC's centralized, automated netting facilities in thegovernment securities market will include reduction of both counterpartycredit risk\7\\3\<NOTE/> and increased efficiency and cost savings, benefits alreadyenjoyed by broker-dealers and banks in the corporate, municipal and mortgage-backedsecurities markets. First, trade netting will reduce delivery and paymentobligations for dealers. Testing of GSCC's netting system indicates thatboth the size and number of delivery and payment obligations will be reducedby up to 90%.\7\\4\<NOTE/> Thus neeting will reduce both exposure and settlement costsfor GSCC members. Second, GSCC's facilities will reduce member exposureto the risk that the party it trades with will be unable to settle thattransaction. GSCC will interpose itself between parties to a trade andguarantee settlement. If a member fails to satisfy a settlement obligation,GSCC's mechanisms, including marks-to-the-market of fail positions, clearingfund deposits, and insolvency procedures, will reduce the likelihood ofloss to its counter-parties and GSCC. Finally, the netting system willreduce daylight over-drafts on Fedwire and the risk that the failure ofone institution to settle may cause losses or the failure of other institutions.The staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``FRB''),in a recent proposal, estimated that GSCC would directly reduce book-entryoverdrafts of government securities over Fedwire by about 5%.\7\\5\<NOTE/> The proposal also stated that GSCC would provide other riskcontrol advantages to market participants, and indirectly to the FRB.\7\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\``Counterparty credit risk'' is the risk to one partyto a trade that the other party to the trade will default on its paymentor delivery obligations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\Netting may not reduce a member's delivery or receiptobligation to a single Fedwire movement. The Fedwire $50 million cap oneach Fedwire securities movement may require more than one Fedwire deliveryto satisfy a large net obligation. The reduction of the number of Fedwiremovements, however, still will be substantial despite the cap. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\<T3>See </T3>Proposals for Modifying the Payments System Risk ReductionPolicy Proposal, Staff of the Federal Reserve System, May 1989 (``FederalReserve Staff Proposals''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\The other risk control advantages stated are: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Controlling and reducing resettlement credit risks, especiallythrough the broker's market, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Accelerating and strengthening the ``pair-off'' process to eliminateone of several obstacles to earlier releases of securities transfers. </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 29. The Commission believes GSCC has the capacity to operate a central nettingservice for government securities. First, GSCC's facilities manager, NSCC,has operated a netting system for corporate securities since the 1970sthat accounts for approximately 90% of the number and dollar value of alltrades executed on national securities exchanges and in over-the-countermarkets. Although the dollar value of daily transactions in governmentsecurities is substantially greater, NSCC's experience in operating a nettingsystem by novation is nonetheless invaluable to the smooth operation ofGSCC's netting system. Because of the volume of daily trading activity, the short settlement timeframe and the importance of the government securities market, GSCC mustbe able to perform both its comparison and netting system accurately andon a timely basis even during severe market conditions. GSCC has representedto the Commisson that it will be able to operate its entire trade processingsystem accurately and within time frames established by GSCC during currentand reasonably anticipated future average daily and peak volume processingdays.\7\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\<T3>See </T3>GSCC Temporary Registration Order, <T3>supra </T3>note 6, at n. 33. GSCC expects that the comparison and netting process will require onlyseveral hours and will be completed during the early morning hours. Accordingly,the Commission believes GSCC will have sufficient flexibility to handlebrief interruptions or delays without compromising smooth and efficientsettlement during the day.GSCC recently completed arrangements for, and tested the operational capabilityof, a back-up facility in the event a power failure or disaster preventedGSCC's operations at its main facility. GSCC has contracted with SecurityPacific National Trust Co. (``Security Pacific'') to provide GSCC withan off-site computer backup facility in the event of a disaster at GSCC'smain facility. The agreement provides that Security Pacific's backup computerfacility will become available within two hours of notification of a disaster,and Security Pacific will provide the facility on a continuous basis untilGSCC's main facility can resume operations.GSCC's payment and delivery functions will be assigned to banks with anestablished history and reputation for providing clearing and payment servicesto government securities brokers and dealers, many of whom will be GSCCnetting members. Those banks will operate in accordance with GSCC's instructions,which GSCC will generate during the netting process before the businessday begins.\78\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ GSCC's relationship with the clearing agent banks issomewhat analogous to NSCC's relationship with DTC. NSCC maintains an accountat DTC and issues instructions to DTC to move securities from and to theDTC accounts of NSCC and NSCC's clearing members. NSCC then delivers securitiesout of its account and into the DTC account of NSCC participants with netlong positions. NSCC, however, does not rely on DTC to settle funds-onlyobligations; rather those obligations are settled directly through NSCC.The Commission believes, after examination of GSCC's agreement with itsclearing agent banks, and with the knowledge of those banks' experiencewith government securities clearing and payment services, that GSCC hasthe capacity to handle its payment and receipt obligations, arising outof the netting process.B. Safeguarding Funds and SecuritiesSection 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agencybe designed to, among other things, assure the safeguarding of securitiesand funds which are in its custody or control. Clearing agencies must assessthe risks to the clearing agency and its participants and develop a schemeto satisfy those risks on a uniform, non-discriminatory basis. GSCC hasdevised a variety of ways to reduce the risk to itself and its participants,including membership standards, member monitoring, the authority to restricta member's access to netting, the clearing fund and the loss allocationscheme.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Participation Standards</ITAG>In the Order granting GSCC temporary registration as a clearing agency,the Commission temporarily exempted GSCC from section 17A(b)(3)(B) and17A(b)(4)(B), on the basis of GSCC's representation that it would ``developappropriate member financial and operational standards in the near future,before it expand[ed] its range of services, and, in any event, before itoffer[ed] trade accounting or netting services.'' \79\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that GSCC's participant standardsshould be based on the anticipated credit risk associated with clearingagency admission. In the GSCC Temporary Registration Order, the Commissionrecognized that minimum capital requirements may not adequately cover suchcredit risk and encouraged GSCC to use its experience as guidance in establishingfinancial responsiblity standards for membership.\80\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ GSCC Temporary Registration Order, <T3>supra </T3>note 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>Id.</T3>GSCC has developed operational and financial responsibility standards basedon its experience as a clearing agency engaging in comparison-only activitiesover the past year. GSCC's capital requirements are substantially higherthan the minimum capital requirements for government securities brokersand dealers established by the Treasury Department.\81\<NOTE/> GSCC believes that these membership standards for broker,dealer, and bank applicants are fair and appropriate in light of the riskposed by a member of GSCC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 400.1 through 402.2d, 52 FR 27910 (July 24, 1987).<T3>See also </T3>17 CFR 240.15c3-1.The Commission believes that GSCC has established reasonable financialand operational requirements for the admission of brokers, dealers andbank applicants. The Commission recognizes that GSCC only has one year'sexperience as a clearing agency and that the experience GSCC will gainfrom the netting of Government securities will provide GSCC with the furtherexperience to more appropriately evaluate the credit risk associated withclearing agency admission.Thus, the Commission expects GSCC to review its financial and operationalstandards in light of the experience it gains from netting, prior to theCommission's consideration of GSCC's full registration (<T3>i.e., </T3>before May 24, 1991, the expiration date of the Order temporarilyapproving GSCC's application for registration as a clearing agency.\82\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ The Commission is continuing GSCC's exemption from sections17A(b)(3)(B) and 17A(b)(4)(B) of the Act. GSCC rules do not specificallyenumerate other clearing agencies, investment companies and insurance companieswithin its categories for membership and do not have appropriate standardsfor these categories and members. GSCC has represented that it will amendits rules prior to full registration of GSCC (<T3>i.e., </T3>May 24, 1991, the expiration date of the GSCC TemporaryRegistration Order) in order to provide explicitly for the admission ofall statutorily enumerated categories of members into the comparison-onlyand netting systems. In addition, GSCC has agreed to develop appropriateoperational and financial standards for other registered clearing agencies,investment companies and insurance companies if any seek to join GSCC.<T3>See </T3>GSCC Temporary Registration Order, <T3>supra </T3>note 6.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Member Monitoring</ITAG>The Commission believes that it is important that GSCC carefully monitoreach member's activities, financial condition and compliance with GSCC'srules, consistent with GSCC's obligations under section 19(g) of the Act.\83\<NOTE/> GSCC should pay close attention daily to each member's settlementposition, the number of aging fails each member is responsible for, andthe changes in the mix of each member's securities portfolio, particularlywhen a member changes its aggregate portfolio to assume a more risky position.GSCC's rules have established adequate early warning requirements to informit when a member is beginning to have difficulties, but GSCC should developfurther sources of information to verify a member's financial and operationalcapabilities. For this reason, the Commission believes that GSCC must coordinateclosely with other SROs, the Commission, and relevant bank regulatory authoritiesconcerning the financial and operational capabilities of its members.\84\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ Section 19(g) of the Act requires a clearing agency tocomply with and to enforce compliance by members of its own rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ <T3>Cf. </T3>Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets,Appendix D, May 1988.Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agencybe designed to, among other things, assure the safeguarding of securitiesand funds which are in its custody or control. Clearing agencies must assessthe risks to the clearing agency and its participants and develop a schemeto satisfy those risks on a uniform, non-discriminatory basis.

System Price and Mark-to-the-Market </ITAG>GSCC proposes to collect and pay marks-to-the-market from or to nettingmembers with fail net settlement positions based on the par weighted averageprice of member trades for those securities during the day. The Commissionbelieves that GSCC's use of a par weighted average price during fallingor rising intra-day markets could weaken GSCC's marking-to-the-market offailed net open positions and expose GSCC to unnecessary risk. Specifically,the Commission is concerned that the par weighted average price may notaccurately reflect the end of the day value of securities positions wheresubstantial intra-day price volatility has occurred. Because governmentsecurities transactions are not time-stamped and dealers and brokers donot report their end-of-day trade prices, there is currently no completelyreliable method to determine an accurate closing price. In order to addressthis concern, GSCC has represented that it will compare the prices establishedfor seven Treasury securities of varying maturities \86\<NOTE/> through its par weighted average system with prices fromother sources, including price made available by the Federal Reserve, inter-dealerbrokers and other public sources.\87\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ The securities are: one-year Treasury Bill, two-year,four-year, five-year, seven-year and ten-year Treasury Notes, and the 30-yearTreasury Bond. <T3>See </T3>Letter to Ester Saverson, Jr., Branch Chief, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, from Jeffrey F. Ingber, Associate General Counsel, GSCC,dated June 29, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ <T3>Id.</T3>GSCC has represented that in establishing a system price, GSCC will compareits par weighted average price with other available prices and if, in GSCC'sjudgment it would be prudent to do so, it will use another price as thesystem price. GSCC will provide the Commission with a monthly report comparingthe par weighted average price with available end-of-day prices. The Commissionbelieves that GSCC's proposed procedures provide an appropriate means todetermine the marking price, at least on an interim basis. The Commission,however will revisit with GSCC the issue of possible changes to its markingof prices after reviewing the data provided. GSCC's proposed rules provide that it may not mark-to-the-market a faillong position where the securities have been delivered to GSCC but areheld overnight because GSCC's clearing agent bank could not redeliver thembefore the Fedwire closed. This situation will arise when a member makesa late-day Fedwire delivery. GSCC will be at risk that the value of thesecurities it holds overnight will decrease, exposing GSCC to risk of lossif the receiving member defaults before delivery the next morning. TheCommission is concerned about whether this marking exception may exposeGSCC to an unnecessary financial risk. In this connection, the Commissionnotes that GSCC's rules provide GSCC with the authority to fine a memberwho regularly effects deliveries which can not be redelivered prior toFedwire closure. In addition, GSCC has represented that it will providethe Commission with a monthly report stating: (1) Each occurrence of anovernight ``box'' position experienced by GSCC's clearing agent bank, (2)the member(s) involved, (3) what, if any, action GSCC's Board takes, and(4) the amount of GSCC financing as a result of the late delivery.\88\<NOTE/> After GSCC compiles and reviews the data, the Commissionexpects that GSCC will examine methods of reducing their overnight riskexposure, including the collection of a mark. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ GSCC may request confidential treatment of the informationcontained in this report. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Clearing Fund Requirements </ITAG>The Act does not require clearing agencies to establish and maintain clearingfunds; however, the Standards Release counsels that ``it is appropriatefor a clearing agency to establish by rule an appropriate level of clearingfund contributions based, among other things, on its assessment of therisks to which it is subject.''\89\<NOTE/> Clearing funds may provide, among other things, a defenseagainst financial loss due to participant defaults; a ready source of liquidfunds in that event; and a vehicle to facilitate risk mutualization amongparticipants. The Commission believes that it is essential that a clearingagency have a liquid source of funds available to meet its liquidity needsindependent of its loss allocation rules.\90\<NOTE/> GSCC's major source of liquidity is its clearing fund.\91\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41920 (``Standards Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ <T3>See also </T3>Federal Reserve Staff Proposals, <T3>supra </T3>note 75, which states that clearing agencies should havean independent source of liquidity to meet its needs and not rely solelyon reversals to shift the loss to its members. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ The collateral which it holds as a result of late deliveriesalso could be used to provide liquidity, but the amount of this collateralin many cases will be too small to meet potential losses from participantdefaults. GSCC plans to use its clearing fund as source of immediate liquidity, tomeet its temporary financing needs\92\<NOTE/> by pledging its required member deposits at one of two bankswith which it has an agreement to provide such financing.\93\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that it is vital that GSCC continueto maintain sufficient sources of credit to obtain immediate financingto meet its liquidity needs and to continue evaluating its credit needsto ensure that it has sufficient sources of temporary financing to meetsuch needs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ An example of a situation when GSCC may need to obtaintemporary financing would occur if a member failed to make his 10:00 a.m.(e.s.t.) funds-only settlement obligation to GSCC, yet GSCC was requiredto pay out those funds as part of GSCC's 11:00 a.m. (e.s.t.) settlementwith its members. GSCC would need to obtain temporary financing by 11:a.m. (e.s.t.) to pay its members until GSCC was able to recover the fundsfrom the defaulting member or through the use of its loss allocation procedures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ GSCC currently maintains these agreements with the SecurityPacific Bank and the Bank of New York. GSCC's clearing fund formula has been properly constructed to serve asa mechanism for GSCC to measure the risk profile of its members' securitiessettlement obligations for yesterday's trades, standing alone, and againstthe backdrop of a member's settlement obligations for the previous month.Initially, GSCC will use a schedule of margin factors for use in calculatingclearing fund contribution requirements.\94\<NOTE/> GSCC believes, based on its review of average daily governmentsecurities price volatility data from the period from the first quarterof 1988 through the first quarter of 1989, that the margin factors containedin its proposed schedule, which reflect calculation of the mean of theprice volatility data plus two standard deviations, cover approximately95% of the historical one-day market movements in each such security and,thus, that the schedule is a prudent and appropriate one.\95\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ As discussed above, GSCC has amended its proposed rulesto authorize GSCC to revise the margin factors to address changing marketconditions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ <T3>See</T3> Letter to Ester Saverson, Jr., <T3>supra</T3> note 86.While the Commission believes that GSCC's proposed schedule is satisfactoryfor the start-up of netting, the Commission believes that GSCC should developthe ability to assess, on an automated, daily basis, historical and potentialprice movements and the implications that those price movements could havefor the risk profile of GSCC members. In the event of a member defaultor insolvency, GSCC will be obligated to close-out and buy-in securitiesat prices that may bear no relation to yesterday's prices. In this connection,because of the potential financial exposure associated with such liquidations,an insufficient margin factor could result in significant losses to GSCC,particularly if a GSCC member determines to concentrate its trading activityin a limited range of maturities or on the same side of the market. Accordingly,GSCC should be in a position to continuously review the adequacy of itsmargin schedule.In this connection, GSCC has undertaken that it will not make eligiblefor netting, and will not net through the Netting System, U.S. agency securities,STRIPS, and U.S. Treasury Bonds (other than the 30-year Treasury Bond),until it has provided the Commission staff with a design plan and schedulefor the implementation of an automated system for the assessment, basedon maturity ranges, of price volatility that satisfactorily takes intoaccount historical and implied volatility.GSCC has taken the additional step of imposing a 1% haircut on lettersof credit which members submit to meet their clearing fund requirementsto ensure that in the aggregate the clearing fund will be sufficient tomeet its needs and to account for possible delays in drawing down on lettersof credit. The Commission believes that imposing the 1% haircut is a prudentstep because it will ensure that GSCC will have the full amount it requiresafter GSCC pays the costs of pledging the letters of credit and offsetsthe financing costs which banks will impose on GSCC because the funds providedpursuant to the letters of credit which GSCC received from its membersare not immediately available.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Loss Allocation</ITAG>The Commission notes that the Act does not require a clearing agency tomutualize the risk of loss among its members. Although some clearing agenciesregistered with the Commission, such as NSCC, \96\<NOTE/> employ some form of risk mutualization for netting by novationsystems, others, such as the Participants Trust Corporation, have a morelimited system of risk mutualization.\97\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that while risk mutualization hascertain benefits, including the provision of liquidity from within theclearing agency environment that otherwise must be provided by outsidesources, full risk mutualization is not required. The Commission will examineeach clearing agency's risk management system, including its clearing fundformula and the amount, if any, of risk mutualization, to determine whetherits risk management procedures are appropriately tailored to the marketsserved by the clearing agency and otherwise satisfy the requirements ofthe Act. The Commission has examined GSCC's risk management system andbelieves that it is an acceptable method of allocating losses among itsparticipants and appropriately balances the statutory goals of promotingprompt and accurate clearance and settlement (by encouraging broker participationin central clearing facilities) and equitable allocation of dues, fees,and other charges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20221 (September 23, 1983),48 FR 45167.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26671 (March 28, 1989),54 FR 13266.In this connection, GSCC's proposal provides for differential treatmentbetween broker and dealer netting members and inter-dealer brokers, withregard to particular aspects of the netting system. For example, the proposalexcludes inter-dealer brokers from having to pay marks-to-the market onnet fail positions. The proposal also limits an inter-dealer broker's liabilityto GSCC at $1.6 million per calendar year. In addition, inter-dealer brokersare exempt from the clearing fund contribution requirements; instead, inter-dealerbrokers must deposit $1.6 million in collateral with GSCC.\98\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that clearing agencies can treatdifferent categories of members differently provided that any differenttreatment contained in the scheme of financial and operational safeguardsis rationally related to the risks posed to the clearing agency by eachclass of participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ GSCC's proposed Rule 4, section 7 requires inter-dealerbrokers participating in the netting system to deposit and maintain a cashdeposit of $100,000 and an additional open account indebtedness of $1.5million secured by either eligible treasury securities or irrevocable lettersof credit.GSCC treats inter-dealer brokers differently than it treats brokers anddealers because inter-dealer brokers present less potential risk to GSCCand its members than brokers and dealers. Inter-dealer brokers act exclusivelyas agents for others through systems intended to ensure that all transactionsare offset. Thus, the extremely large number of transactions in which inter-dealerbrokers participate as parties do not reflect the settlement risks theypose to GSCC. In recognition of this fact, GSCC members collectively decidedto set up a separate financial scheme for inter-dealer brokers that providedfor allocation of losses based on the fact that inter-dealer brokers actexclusively as agents for others. Therefore, the Commission believes thatthe special treatment of inter-dealer brokers as a membership categoryis fair and appropriate in light of the whole scheme GSCC employs to minimizethe risk to itself and its members.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposedrule changes are consistent with the Act and, in particular, section 17Aof the Act.<T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the proposed rule changes (GSCC-98-04; GSCC-89-05; GSCC-89-06; andGSCC-89-07) be, and hereby are, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirley E.
