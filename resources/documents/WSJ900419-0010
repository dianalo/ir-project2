Chase, which will operate the branches as part of itsChase Manhattan Bank, agreed to pay the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. $5 million for 161-year-old Seamen'sdeposits, which represent 169,800 accounts.</LP><TEXT>   As part of the transaction, the FDIC has agreed to offer a$2.1 billion short-term note to Chase, repay securedborrowings of $450 million and retain assets of the failedbank, chiefly mortgage-backed securities, totaling $2.4billion.   Late last year, the American Stock Exchange delistedSeamen's, after the thrift reported a negative net worth of$66 million. For its last publicly reported period, the ninemonths ended Sept. 30, 1989, Seamen's reported a loss of $168million, or $7.18 a share.   For 1988, Seamen's reported earnings of $16.5 million, or$1.02 a share, down 10% from $18.3 million, or $1.10 a share,in 1987.   In 1984, a group of Texas investors injected $75 millionof capital into the troubled mutual savings bank andconverted it to public ownership in 1985. The threeindividuals -- Robert T. Enloe, Robert K. Utley and Jess Hay-- together controlled 69% of the company's stock.   In 1985, Seamen's shifted its strategy from thetraditional thrift role of originating residential mortgagesto one of investing in mortgage-backed securities, buildingup a huge $3.5 billion portfolio. As part of that strategy,Seamen's placed complicated hedges using mortgage-relatedderivative securities on the portfolio to protect its incomefrom rising interest rates.   However, those hedges relied on short-term interest rateskeeping their historical relationship to long-term rates.That relationship changed, and Seamen's found itself payingconsumers more for their deposits.   In composite trading yesterday on the New York StockExchange, Chase Manhattan shares closed at $27.25, down 50cents.</TEXT></DOC>
