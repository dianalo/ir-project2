The report warns that declining oil exploration, a depletion of reserves and rising domestic consumption could turn Southeast Asia's largest oil exporter into an oil importer by the year 2000.    Such a development would have &quot;profound economic consequences&quot; for Indonesia, the report says. While government reforms aimed at raising non-oil exports are under way, the report says that Indonesia will depend on oil and gas exports for the bulk of its foreign-exchange earnings for years to come.    The annual U.S. report, prepared by the embassy staff in Jakarta, is the most comprehensive document on Indonesia's oil industry and its prospects. This year's report recounts the &quot;full retreat&quot; of the oil industry during 1986 because of the collapse of world oil prices, noting that the average price Indonesia received for its oil last year was $13.80 a barrel, about half the year-earlier average.    Foreign-exchange earnings from oil and gas exports in the government's fiscal year ended March 31 dropped 48% from a year earlier, to $6.5 billion. The loss of oil revenue has threatened the country's balance of payments, restricted government spending and forced a currency devaluation last September.    Because of the sharp fall in prices and the world-wide recession in the oil industry, foreign oil-company spending for exploration, development and production in Indonesia last year fell 31% below planned expenditures. The $2.6 billion spent also was 7% below year-earlier spending.    Even though oil prices recovered in 1987, the report says, new contracts with the government to explore and develop fields have been signed at a low rate in recent years, and several oil companies have relinquished their contracts. That means that a significant turnaround in exploration could take at least two more years.    But the report is optimistic about a recovery in spending in 1988 and beyond. It says the government can help counter the time lag in exploration spending by speeding up negotiations with foreign oil companies seeking to extend contracts. The report says the government could require companies to increase investment in the near term in return for extending contracts now set to run out in the next decade.    Another problem is Indonesia's production quota as a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That quota now stands at 1.133 million barrels of crude oil a day.    The U.S. report says OPEC moves to limit output have helped raise oil prices, but &quot;the cost to Indonesia of restraining production is high.&quot; Net exports under the quota are 823,000 barrels a day -- 25% below the level reached after quotas were temporarily abandoned in December 1985.    Further, the OPEC quota hampers Indonesia's desire to expand exploration and add to its reserves.    The report says that Indonesia must encourage active exploration, especially of potentially rich frontier areas, if it is to maintain production and exports into the next century. Domestic demand, although rising slowly, will continue to reduce the amount of oil available for export. Diminishing reserves and falling output will complicate the problem further.    Production of natural gas, used domestically and exported as liquefied natural gas, is expected to increase, which will help ameliorate a decline in oil production.    Indonesia will begin to produce more energy from natural gas than oil by the first half of the 1990s, according to the report, and exports to Japan, Korea and Taiwan are expected to grow steadily under long-term contracts.    However, the report says efforts to use gas in industry and homes are hampered by the offshore locations of major gas fields and by the high cost of building pipelines. It adds that government pricing policies have kept gas prices too low to provide sufficient incentive to producers.    Despite current budget difficulties, the report says, the government should move &quot;sooner rather than later&quot; on building a domestic gas-distribution network. </TEXT></DOC>
