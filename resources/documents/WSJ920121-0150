For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the defense contractor andengineering concern reported a profit of $157.8 million, or$2.37 a share, on sales of $2.43 billion. That compares withnet income of $143.6 million, or $2.20 a share, on $2.46billion in sales in the year-ago quarter.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Raytheon's established commercial diversity was a keycontributor,&quot; the company said in a news release.   Pinched by cuts in defense spending, sales at Raytheon'sElectronics Division, which makes among other things, thePatriot missile, slipped 3% to $5.33 billion in 1991 from$5.51 billion the year earlier.   But the company's Energy Services and Aircraft Productsdivisions, both of which provide engineering and othercivilian services, saw sales gains in 1991 of 20% and 2%respectively. Those segments were highly profitable in 1991and pretax net income in the divisions jumped 43% and 32%respectively over the prior year.   Raytheon's slack in defense business was partly caused bytiming. For instance, it expects to receive a sizablecontract in the current quarter from Saudi Arabia afterCongress cleared the way for the sale of 14 Patriot fireunits and 758 Patriot missiles to the Mideast nation earlierthis month.   Raytheon also said since last January it reduced totaldebt 22% to $1.14 billion from $1.47 billion and trimmed thenumber of its employees by 5,100 to 71,600 world-wide.   For the full year it had net income of $591.8 million, or$8.95 a share, on sales of $9.27 billion. In 1990 the companyreported a profit of $557.3 million, or $8.53 a share, onsales of $9.26 billion in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
