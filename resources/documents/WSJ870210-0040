SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN INTCMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><TEXT>   The shaky U.S.-Japanese trade agreement covering semiconductor sales in both countries inched closer to collapse yesterday, as the U.S. industry's trade group asked President Reagan to impose &quot;trade measures&quot; against Japanese chip producers.    Asserting that the Japanese government &quot;repeatedly failed to live up to its side of the bargain&quot; since the agreement was signed, the Cupertino, Calif.-based Semiconductor Industry Association said &quot;it is now both necessary and appropriate&quot; to take punitive action against Japanese products.    Last July 31, trade representatives of both countries signed the sweeping chip agreement, setting minimum prices for certain Japanese-made chips sold anywhere outside Japan and committing the Japanese government to help U.S. chip makers win more of Japan's own market for chips, now the largest in the world.    Upon signing the accord, the U.S. agreed to waive punitive duties against various Japanese producers for illegally &quot;dumping&quot; semiconductors in the U.S. at prices lower than it cost to make them. U.S. chipmakers asserted at the time that Japanese &quot;predatory pricing&quot; was endangering the financial health of the entire U.S. industry.    U.S. chipmakers have complained since last September that Japanese companies have been ignoring price benchmarks set by the Commerce Department for certain dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, and eraseable programmable read only memory chips, or Eproms, high-volume staple products used in nearly every computer. While Japanese companies have honored the prices in the U.S., chip customers and U.S. producers contend that dumping has continued in &quot;third countries&quot; at prices as much as 33% below assigned prices.    In Washington, U.S. trade officials declined to comment on the semiconductor association's report, saying they hadn't finished reading it yet. Administration policy makers said, however, that the document is unlikely to result in any new government actions. The administration already has told Tokyo it will give Japan until early March or April to comply with the Aug. 31 accord. Washington has warned that if there still are serious violations, it will consider abrogating the pact.    &quot;It was time to pull the trigger&quot; on the agreement, said Andrew S. Grove, president and chief executive officer of Intel Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based semiconductor maker. Mr. Grove asserted that Japanese companies recently have been dumping Eproms in Europe at prices well below assigned values.    As recently as six weeks ago, Mr. Grove thought the agreement might yet hold up. &quot;It has been almost like a cleverly orchestrated deal,&quot; he said. &quot;Whenever the noise or temperature would build up, the Japanese would pull back prices just enough to give us a sense that the agreement is about to work.&quot;    The trade association requested the trade sanctions as part of what it called a &quot;report to the president&quot; that was delivered to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. In that report, the association estimated that by March 31 the U.S. will have lost more than $100 million in waived dumping duties, and U.S. companies will have lost more than $60 million in sales of chips in Japan.    The report stopped short of asking that the agreement be scuttled outright. &quot;Measures should be aimed at enforcing the commitments and achieving the objectives of the agreement both with respect to market access (in Japan) and the prevention of dumping in the U.S. and other markets,&quot; the report said.    Mr. Grove of Intel, however, would like to see the government go beyond merely imposing penalty duties to enforce the accord. &quot;To reimpose duties would just freeze in this windfall we have given them,&quot; he said. &quot;The only way to get results is to hit them where they live. I would like to see duties on electronic equipment, whether it be printers, computers, VCRs (videocassette recorders), and such,&quot; not just chips.    With the request to impose trade measures on the record, it is now up to the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to decide whether to go ahead and impose duties, and perhaps even wider and more protective penalties, something both the U.S. and Japan had hoped to avoid.    In recent weeks, however, even U.S. officials have hinted that harsher penalties might be in store. Late last month, Undersecretary of Commerce Bruce Smart, who at the time was in Tokyo to discuss problems with the trade agreement, threatened that the Reagan administration might cancel the agreement if Japanese companies didn't &quot;begin to work and work fast&quot; at making the accord work. </TEXT></DOC>
