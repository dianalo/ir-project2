Unions representing electricians and laborers also authorizedstrikes against producers on Monday, said Earl Bush,secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 399. He estimated about3,200 workers were on strike.   Producers, stung already by a 22-week strike by scriptwritersthat ended in August, vowed their movie and television productionschedules would not be disrupted again and hired replacementdrivers. No new talks were scheduled.   The Hollywood plumbers and plasterers unions did not join theprotest. And Hollywood's talent unions _ actors, writers anddirectors _ have contract clauses that forbid them from honoringthe picket lines of other unions.   Teamsters were hoping that drivers who belong to locals thataren't striking the producers would still honor picket lines andrefrain from making deliveries to studios.   The strike was called after weekend negotiations, which wereordered by a federal mediator, collapsed. The union voted 1,441-196on Thursday to reject the contract proposal submitted by theAlliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.   Key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules forweekend work, salary rates, wages for out-of-town film andtelevision production and guidelines for making non-union films.Some Teamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61to $14 per hour.   About two dozen pickets marched Monday in front of the HollywoodBoulevard offices of producer Stephen J. Cannell. Drivers alsopicketed the Cannell production ``Hunter.'' The NBC-TV show wasshooting on location at the Santa Monica Pier.   Bush blamed the producers for the impasse.   ``We have attempted to cooperate every way possible not to havea strike,'' he said. ``Can we stop production? I guess that'ssomething we're going to have to wait to see.''   In a separate news conference, J. Nicholas Counter, president ofthe alliance, said the Teamsters' demands were unreasonable in anera of higher production costs.   ``We've been very flexible in attempting to achieve our goals,''Counter said. ``These issues are as important to us as the issuesin the writers' strike.''   Counter said replacement drivers would have no problem fillingwork requirements. ``We will continue to produce,'' Counter said.``We will operate today. We will operate tomorrow.''   Bush said the Teamsters had offered to extend the contract thatexpired on July 31 for one year, but the producers refused. Heclaimed the producers' bargaining position reflected an attempt to``break the union.''   Counter denied that producers were engaged in any union-bustingtactics. ``We will gain control of our costs,'' Counter said. ``Andthat's not union-busting. We're trying to create more union jobs.''   Bush said he did not know when talks would resume or how longthe strike might last. ``The next move is up to the federalmediator.''</TEXT></DOC>
