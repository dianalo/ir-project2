Two methodsof transportation by ships and pipelines are considered, but both ofthem have some problems. In the case of ship transportation, the costof construction is low, the preparation of ships corresponding to theamount of production is possible, the selection of shipping route iseasy, and the effect of destruction of environment is weak, but continuouslarge-scale transportation is impossible. Further, the development ofnew and powerful ice smashing tanker or submarine tanker is necessary.In the case of pipeline transportation, continuous large-scale transportationis possible, but new establishment of large caliber pipelines is necessary,which is very expensive corresponding to the proved reserve of oil andgas, and further has a strong effect on the destruction of the environment.(22 figs, 19 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
