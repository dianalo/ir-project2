Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Ruder said the market-making systems of the stock exchanges, of the over-the-counter market's Nasdaq system and of the options markets &quot;need to be looked at.&quot;    Mr. Ruder declined to blame the futures markets for the one-day 22.6% crash in the stock market, as several commentators have done. But he said his &quot;preliminary judgment&quot; is that &quot;stock index futures did contribute to volatility to some degree.&quot; He also said that although derivative financial instruments such as the index futures have some usefulness, &quot;these benefits may not be sufficient&quot; in times of crisis.    In addition, he said institutional investors may have been &quot;oversold&quot; on the computerized hedging strategy known as portfolio insurance. &quot;It may very well be that as a result they overbought,&quot; he said.    Mr. Ruder said the SEC in recent weeks has been &quot;somewhat hampered&quot; by the division of securities-regulation authority between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the financial futures markets.    He also said the SEC needs a &quot;significant increase&quot; in staff and that maintaining or cutting the current staffing level &quot;would simply be a disaster for us.&quot; Mr. Ruder said he senses administration support for an increase, despite efforts to trim the federal budget.    The SEC chairman twice said that the markets as a whole were &quot;overbought.&quot; First, he said that &quot;the markets were very much in an overbought situation&quot; without specifying the period he had in mind. Later in his testimony, he said, &quot;When the Dow (Jones Industrial Average) was at 2700, it was my personal opinion that it was too high.&quot; The industrial average reached a high of 2722.42 in late August. It stood at 2246.74 before its Oct. 19 plunge, and it closed yesterday at 1945.29.    An SEC spokeswoman later said Mr. Ruder had intended to make the point that the stock market was too high for several months before the crash.    The dominant theme of his testimony was concern about the structure of the markets, and specifically about the capital adequacy of market-makers.    Asked what he would do if he knew another market plunge would occur in a few months, he said: &quot;I would want to look at the margin system and at the order-routing system. I would want most of all to look at what steps could be taken to increase available capital.&quot;    He added: &quot;To me, the most important thing would be to assure that there is sufficient capital to prevent unnecessary volatility.&quot;    By focusing on market structure in his first public statements on the issue, the SEC chairman could shape the debate about regulatory and legislative responses to the market plunge.    Mr. Ruder said the commission will examine &quot;very closely&quot; the clearance and settlement systems of broker-dealers and will urge firms to maintain adequate back-office staffs. He said, &quot;We are going to insist that there be adequate routing systems in the future.&quot;    Mr. Ruder also said the SEC will be looking at how small investors were treated during the market plunge. Reminded by Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) of the SEC's mandate to protect small investors, Mr. Ruder said, &quot;Don't you worry about that, sir.&quot;    He then said, &quot;I would like to take regulatory action to make sure that that small investor doesn't feel pushed away from the market.&quot;    Several senators expressed concern that firms may have taken care of their own positions before handling customers' trades, a practice sometimes referred to as &quot;front-running.&quot;    Sen. Donald Riegle Jr. (D., Mich.) said he had heard rumors &quot;that during the events of recent weeks, certain firms sold for their own accounts before executing individual orders.&quot; Mr. Ruder said the SEC plans to look into the matter.    The unspoken question of the day was whether Congress will make the futures markets and computerized trading the twin villains of the crash. The initial reaction on Capitol Hill against computerized program trading seems to have faded.    Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) said, &quot;If by eliminating the use of the computer, you could make stock prices higher, I suggest you outlaw the use of the calculator,&quot; and even the pencil, and order that trades be chiseled in stone.    But futures trading remained the subject of many questions by the committee. Sen. Bob Graham (D., Fla.) said, for example, that the social value of financial instruments such as index options &quot;isn't clear to me.&quot;    Mr. Ruder sidestepped most of the argument, saying, &quot;I think it's very premature to place blame on the futures market and the way it operates, or on the stock market and the way it operates.&quot; Although he said trading in stock-index futures appears to have contributed to market volatility, he also said that if futures trading were stopped in the U.S., it simply would move overseas.    Mr. Ruder also declined to identify excessive speculation as the culprit in the crash. &quot;I don't think we can easily state what is too speculative and what isn't,&quot; he said.    He said he expects the SEC to reach preliminary conclusions about the causes and effects of the crash next month.    In response to a question, Mr. Ruder said he &quot;wouldn't personally support&quot; provisions in the House-passed deficit-reduction package that would eliminate several tax breaks related to corporate mergers and acquisitions.    Several Democratic senators criticized the SEC. Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), the committee's chairman, said John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, in recent years repeatedly expressed concern over the possibility of a market crash, while Mr. Ruder's predecessor at the SEC, John Shad, was telling the Senate that the chances of such an event were remote.    &quot;It is now evident that the New York Stock Exchange had a much firmer grip on reality than the SEC,&quot; Sen. Proxmire said.    Mr. Ruder recalled that when he took office three months ago, SEC staff members told him they were &quot;intensely&quot; concerned by the market's volatility. &quot;My response was, 'We better get going on this,'&quot; he said.    Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.) said he is concerned by the possibility that &quot;we may have not have seen anything yet&quot; in terms of problems in the markets. He said he plans to introduce a bill to have the Federal Reserve set margin requirements for the futures markets, as it currently does for the stock markets.    Meanwhile, at a hearing yesterday before the House Agriculture Committee's credit panel, lawmakers and CFTC officials cautioned against prematurely blaming computerized program trading for triggering the market collapse.    Robert Davis, a CFTC commissioner, said a &quot;reflex condemnation&quot; of program trading wouldn't be &quot;helpful.&quot; Kalo Hineman, acting CFTC chairman, said index arbitrage volume on Oct. 19 wasn't &quot;as high as we have seen on other days.&quot;    Mr. Hineman attributed the 508.00-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that day to investor pessimism. Commissioner William Seale cited such factors as the U.S. budget and trade deficits, rising interest rates and military clashes in the Persian Gulf region.    In holding the hearing, members of the Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, were also asserting themselves in a developing turf battle with Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    The CFTC commissioners vehemently objected to suggestions that their agency be merged into the larger SEC or that stock-index futures be regulated by the SEC. The latter suggestion, Mr. Seale said, would incorrectly &quot;imply the CFTC somehow had failed its regulatory mandate.&quot;    Commissioner Fowler West said combining the SEC and the CFTC would &quot;spell disaster for the futures industry,&quot; particularly in agricultural commodities. He and other commissioners argued that the futures markets, which allow investors to hedge risks, are fundamentally different from securities markets and should be overseen by regulators with the necessary specialized knowledge.    ---   Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
