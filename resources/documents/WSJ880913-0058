But trading was very light ahead of tomorrow morning's release of U.S. trade figures for July.    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield of the latest 30-year government bonds climbed back above 9%, finishing the day at 9.03%, up from 8.98% Friday.    Oil prices initially fell early yesterday but later reversed direction, surprising bond traders. Many analysts recently have been forecasting lower oil prices, a development that they said would bolster prospects for keeping inflation under control.    The reversal in oil prices came after Saudi Arabian King Fahd issued a brief statement expressing hope that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to reestablish production discipline.    The bond market reaction yesterday &quot;was larger than it might have been on a busier day,&quot; said William Michaelcheck, senior managing director of the fixed-income department at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Moreover, he said, &quot;the market has been bullish for several days, and when you get a piece of information contrary to that trend, you're going to get a sharp reaction.&quot;    Traders said volume was light not only because of nervousness about what the trade report will show but also because of the Jewish New Year.    Most analysts in several recent surveys predicted that tomorrow's trade report will show a smaller deficit than June's $12.54 billion gap. According to the average estimate of 15 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the trade gap narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $11.2 billion in July. Estimates ranged from $10.5 billion to $12 billion.    Treasury Securities   After inching lower early yesterday, Treasury bond prices fell further in the afternoon in sluggish activity.    The government's latest 30-year issue closed at 100 29/32, down 17/32 of a point from last Friday. Other benchmark issues also fell. For example, the Treasury's latest 10-year notes were quoted late in the day at 101 30/32, down from 102 5/32, while the yield rose to 8.95% from 8.92%.    The yield on the Treasury's latest two-year notes rose slightly to 8.41% from 8.39%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., fell 5.22 points to 1241.26. It ranged between 1239.11 and 1248.23.    Among short-term interest rates, the average rate on new 13-week Treasury bills auctioned yesterday by the government was 7.21%. That was down from an average of 7.26% at last week's sale.    The average rate on new 26-week bills rose slightly to 7.41% from 7.40% last week.    The Federal Reserve yesterday moved to inject funds into the banking system by arranging three-day repurchase agreements. While some analysts said the move was more aggressive than they had expected, many others agreed it was merely technical in nature, related to the Sept. 15 corporate tax date and building Treasury cash balances at the Fed. Thus, they said, it doesn't indicate any change in the Fed's credit policy.    The Fed move came at a time when the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, was trading at 8 3/16%.    Here are details of the Treasury bill auction yesterday:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                  13-Week         26-Week    Applications ........... $29,487,020,000 $27,263,935,000    Accepted bids ..........  $7,021,395,000  $7,027,100,000    Accepted at low price .............. 19%              5%    Accepted noncompet'ly ... $1,122,005,000    $974,410,000    Average price (Rate) ..... 98.177(7.21%)   96.254(7.41%)    High price (Rate) ........ 98.180(7.20%)   96.259(7.40%)    Low price (Rate) ......... 98.175(7.22%)   96.249(7.42%)    Coupon equivalent ................ 7.45%           7.80%   Both issues are dated Sept. 15. The 13-week bills mature Dec. 15, and the 26-week bills mature March 16, 1989.   Foreign Bonds   Australian bonds have produced exceptionally attractive returns so far this year and are likely to continue to sparkle in coming months, according to the investment adviser for a large mutual fund.   PaineWebber Master Global Income Fund is planning to keep a large percentage of its assets in the Australian bond market, said Nimrod Fachler, a managing director at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management. Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management is the investment adviser to the PaineWebber fund, which has $1.1 billion under management.   Since the PaineWebber fund began in March 1987, Mr. Fachler has kept a large position in Australian paper. He said in an interview that he will continue holding about 32% of the fund's assets in Australian paper, just short of the 40% maximum allowed by the fund's prospectus in any one country.   He said that when the fund was started in March 1987, he detected a government &quot;extremely committed to tightening the budget process,&quot; balancing the budget and lowering inflation. Government bonds he bought yielding around 14% now yield around 12%, thus producing large price gains for the PaineWebber portfolio.   Mr. Fachler thinks Australian government bond yields will drop to about 11 1/2% or lower in the next six to nine months. He contends that the government is &quot;in excellent control of the economy and inflation is still falling. The budget surplus is huge.&quot; Moreover, he thinks inflation in the next year will fall to the 5% to 5 1/2% range from the 7.1% level at the end of the last fiscal year. And while the Australian government turned a budget deficit into a surplus, he's heartened by the government's decision to use that surplus to redeem Australian government paper.   According to data compiled by Salomon Brothers Inc., the Australian government bond market, in U.S. dollar terms, was the best performer among all major government bond markets in August, with a 1.25% total rate of return. Moreover, on a year-to-date basis, the Australian government market was the best performer, with a 22% total rate of return. The next best market, Canada, returned 10.3%.   Absent from the portfolio entirely are long-term U.S. government bonds. There won't likely be any in his portfolio &quot;for a while. I can sit and wait,&quot; as he expects long-term bond yields, now just above 9%, to edge up to 10% within the next six months. However, he added: &quot;I will be heavily invested in the U.S. sometime in 1989.&quot;   Bond trading yesterday in the West German, Japanese and U.K. markets generally was lethargic. West German and British government bond prices edged higher, while Japanese issues finished little changed.   In West Germany, the government's 6 3/4% issue due 1998 ended at 100.70 bid, 0.05 point higher than Friday's interbank close of 100.65. On the Euromark side, the European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue of 1998 finished at 99.20, up 0.25 point from Friday.   &quot;It's quiet and steady,&quot; one Eurobond dealer said, &quot;We're all waiting for Wednesday,&quot; when the U.S. trade figures will be released by the Commerce Department.   In Tokyo, the benchmark No. 105, 5% bonds of 1997 closed in the inter-dealer market at a price of 98.90 to yield 5.175%, unchanged on the day. The range on the session was only three basis points, 5.165% to 5.195%. Volume was light.   In London, gilt prices ended with small gains as traders reacted with relief that August's retail sales increase wasn't as large as some had feared.   The British government's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 rose 6/32 to 113 23/32 to yield 9.93%. The government's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 rose 1/8 to 102 1/32 to yield 10.70%.   Nevertheless, dealers said the market remains nervous ahead of other economic data due later this week, including the release of new U.S. trade data on Wednesday.   Municipal Issues   Rebounding oil prices and a downdraft in Treasury bond prices pushed municipal bonds to the lower end of their session trading range in light activity.   Some long-term municipal bonds finished about 1/8 point lower on the day. For example, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted late in the day at 92 3/8 bid, off 1/8 point, with bids staying between 92 3/8 and 92 5/8 all day. The yield on the bonds rose slightly to 7.86% from 7.85%.   With the ranks of participants thinned by observance of the Jewish New Year and with some participants hesitant to commit funds ahead of the next round of economic indicators, the volume of trading was moderate during the session, and prices stayed in small ranges.   New issuance was also light. Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. tentatively priced $175 million of homeowner mortgage revenue bonds from the State of New York Mortgage Agency.   Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities eased from session highs in late trading and ended lower, but they outperformed Treasurys, which were pressured lower by a sharp rebound in oil prices.   Ginnie Mae 10% securities for September delivery were off 2/32 at 100 6/32 in late afternoon trading, yielding about 10.12% to a 12-year average life. That narrowed the spread to the benchmark Treasury 10-year note to 117 basis points, from about 119 basis points Friday afternoon.   Elsewhere in the secondary market, Ginnie Mae 9% securities were off 2/32 at 94 1/2, Freddie Mac 10% securities off 1/32 at 99 24/32 and Fannie Mae 10% issues down 4/32 at 100 4/32.   Retail trading was relatively light during the session, due in large part to the Jewish New Year thinning Street participants. Activity is expected to pick up Wednesday.   On the pricing front, one of the few new offerings launched was a package of $106.7 million of conventional manufactured housing contracts pass-through certificates from Merrill Lynch Mortgage Investors Inc.   The Series 1988-J offering was priced as 9.95% securities at 99 13/32 to yield 10.21%.   Backed by a 23% letter of credit from the Industrial Bank of Japan, the certificates are rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is lead underwriter.   Corporate Issues   Rebounding oil prices dragged corporate bonds lower in late trading, leaving some issues 1/4 to 3/8 point softer on the day.   Prices started the session on a quiet but stable note, and wavered in line with oil price fluctuations and Treasurys during the course of the session.   Crude oil futures for October delivery settled 31 cents higher at $14.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, having earlier slipped as low as $13.75 a barrel.   Chief among new corporate issues Monday was the pricing of $300 million of Masco Corp. notes by underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   The 9 1/4% notes, due Sept. 15, 1993, were priced at 99 3/8 to yield 9.41%, 75 basis points over the Treasury's benchmark five-year note.   The issue is noncallable for three years and is rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
