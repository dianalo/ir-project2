Bob'sserves up a sandwich of thinly sliced steak which has been cooked on a hotgrill with the appropriate sizzle and scraping of the metal spatula as themeat is moved around so it doesn't burn. A healthy serving of onions and anadmittedly messy dollop of melted cheese is scooped on to the bun.Monday-Thursday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday 11 a.m.to 10 p.m. (star)(star)(star);    The Country Way Restaurant,  5325 MowryAve., Fremont, (415) 797-3188, is a place that specializes in itsordinaryness.

The food is excellent while the service is well-intentioned, but a littlescattered.

(star)(star)(star);    Chevy's Mexican Restaurant,  5605 Mowry SchoolRoad, Newark, (415) 226-9080, is a perfect imitation of one of those good-timerestaurants on Mexico's coast.
