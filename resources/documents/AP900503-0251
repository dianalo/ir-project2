The store's computer recordsthe fact that an item has been sold. Using the information, thecomputer can automatically reorder goods from Levi's.   _As orders are shipped by Levi's, the company's distributioncenter generates packing slips and sends them electronically to thestore's computer. The store now knows what is coming and when toexpect it.   _Stores receive pre-ticketed Levi's products in boxes printedwith a bar code on the side. This bar code is cross-referenced tothe electronic packing slip number. When stores scan the bar codethey eliminate the need to count the merchandise by hand, and thegoods can be sent directly to the store shelves.   _Under an improvement in the system to be introduced soon,Levi's computers will automatically reorder denim and othersupplies needed to make more jeans to replace those shipped.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday May 6</NOTE></DOC>
