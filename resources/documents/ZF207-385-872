Weber, who was deputy chief of staff for planning inthe Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base, Colo., will head thenew division.andM;Meanwhile, a new commander was named recently for the Air Force ComputerAcquisitions Center (AFCAC), one of the activities that will report to CSD.andO;Col.andP;  John W. Davies succeeds Col.andP;  Richard L. Ferro, who retired this year.andM;Davies formerly was the commander of the 2163rd communications group of theSpace Communications Division within the Air Force Communications Command(AFCC).andM;Located at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, Mass., AFCAC oversees majorcomputer procurements for the service.andP;  Other activities that will report toCSD include:andM;* The Standard Systems Center (SSC), also located at Gunter, which emphasizessoftware development and advanced computing.andM;* The Command and Control Systems Center, a specialized communications groupat Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.andM;* The Computer Services Center, which provides fee-for-service applicationssupport to other Air Force units from its base of mainframes at Brooks AirForce Base, Texas.andM;AFCC officials said they expect the Computer Systems Division to coordinateplanning and develop policies for future technologies and procurements.andM;Bob Majors, CSD's deputy commander, said the staff of about 100 will be madeup mostly of holdovers from SSC's planning section, which was eliminated whenCSD was formed.andM;&quot;The computer units within the AFCC have been sort of diverse for a number ofyears,&quot; Majors said.andP;  &quot;There had been several studies in the past that showedit made sense to consolidate things.&quot;andM;Majors said the Computer Systems Division will oversee all AFCAC and SSCacquisitions, but it will not &quot;fight the local brush fires you fight on adaily basis when you're implementing and maintaining computer systems.&quot;andM;That task, he said, will remain within the subordinate units.andM;&quot;Where you will see us involved in procurements,&quot; Majors said, &quot;is insomething that's maybe two or three years down the line, not Desktop IIIsource selection or something that's already in the works.&quot;andM;He said CSD would try to standardize the procurement process by developinguniform costs models, life cycle maintenance and software requirements.andM;But for the most part, Majors said, the division will be concerned withlong-range planning.andP;  &quot;One of the real advantages we see in the divisionstructure is that it will give us a true long-range technology group that canlook out and see where things are going and where the Air Force ought to be,&quot;he said.andM;Col.andP;  Charles Loney, who helped set up the CSD structure, said, &quot;We have agroup that provides policies and procedures which will be applied throughoutall the reporting units.andP;  And then we have what we call advanced technologyand concepts.&quot;andM;Loney said the technology specialists will concentrate on matters likearchitecture and integration issues, acquisitions stream-lining and softwaredevelopment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
