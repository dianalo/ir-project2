The currently certified facility consists of two combustionturbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators and one extraction/condensingsteam turbine generator. Thermal energy recovered from the facility isto be utilized in the cooling process for a cold storage facility and forheating and cooling of industrial buildings located nearby the facility.The net electric power production capacity was to be 295 megawatts. Theprimary energy source is natural gas, with oil used when natural gas isnot available.The recertification is requested due to a change in the type of generatingequipment used in the facility and an increase in the net electric powerproduction capacity from 295 MW to 301 MW. In addition, steam from thefacility will no longer be used in a cold storage facility but will beused by National Energetics Company in the production of carbon dioxide.Steam from the facility will continue to be used for heating and coolingof an industrial building located nearby. Installation of the facilitywill begin on February 1, 1989.
