The group, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop DesmondTutu, were to present their plan today on Capitol Hill to some 80lawmakers, governors, business leaders and academics. They havealso asked to meet with President Bush.   The blueprint includes ``constitutional principles for apost-apartheid South Africa,'' said Randall Robinson, director ofTransAfrica, the lobbying group coordinating the visit. The SouthAfrican delegation also includes the Revs. Allan Boesak, BeyersNaude and Frank Chikane.   Robinson said the four will propose a detailed negotiatingprocess with their government. ``They hope to salvage the window ofopportunity that exists now for a negotiated settlement,'' he saidin an interview. ``It won't exist forever, and then there'll onlybe bloodshed.''   U.S. anti-apartheid leaders and government officials believe anexpected leadership change in South Africa means an opportunity toengage in negotiations with the government on granting politicalrights to the black majority.   National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to becomeSouth Africa's next leader once President P.W. Botha retires inSeptember, has called for a new political system in his country,although he rejects a one-person, one-vote system espoused byanti-apartheid groups.   There has been speculation de Klerk may come to the UnitedStates for a visit later this year.   State Department officials say the administration has decided tobroaden its contacts with South African leaders across thepolitical spectrum and that a de Klerk visit is possible.   The proposals of the anti-apartheid leadership promptedpublication Tuesday of a Gallup survey showing most South Africansoppose international economic sanctions because they believe thesanctions lead to joblessness rather than political change.   Only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea becausethey would force the government to abolish apartheid. Six of 10blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led thegovernment to resign within five years.   The survey of 2,192 people _ 1,400 blacks, 392 whites and 400 ofmixed race and Asian origin _ was commissioned by the South AfricanChamber of Mines, representing the country's mining industry.   Of those polled, 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of thewhites rejected foreign sanctions, with most saying they would leadto higher unemployment.   Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986,overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, in an effort to forcethe government to grant political rights to the black majority.   The survey, conducted between March 11 and May 8, had a 4percent margin of error. Neil Upmeyer, research director forGallup, said that to ensure credibility of the responses,interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewerswho were of the same race as the respondent.   In the survey, 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of thewhites, and 58 percent of all respondents, said American companiesin South Africa can help make the government moderate its racialpolicies.   Of those polled, 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whitessaid ending American business operations would seriously hurt theSouth African economy.</TEXT></DOC>
