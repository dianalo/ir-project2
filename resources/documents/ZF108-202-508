(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Bruce HaaseandM;Manufacturing and Consulting Services (MCS) has been in the CADD business foralmost two decades, and it has developed an excellent reputation in themainframe, minicomputer, and workstation markets.andP;  For the PC-based 3-D CADDmarket, MCS offers Anvil-5000, Version 2.andP;  The product ranges in price from4,800 for the 3-D design and drafting module alone to $10,400 for thecomplete system, which includes a 2.5- and 3-axis NC CAM milling package andfinite-element modeling.andM;The PC version of Anvil is ported down from the same code used by its bigbrothers; it shares a user interface with its mainframe and workstationcounterparts, so if you move from one to another you won't have to learn newcommands or deal with different menus and icons.andP;  Your files can be easilytransferred between hardware platforms as well.andM;Paradoxically, that interoperability may also be Anvil 5000's weakest point.andO;The program's executable file, which weighs in at over 11MB, is gargantuan.andO;And as feature-packed and powerful as the software is, it acts sluggish inplaces, as if it hasn't been optimized for the PC.andP;  For example, shading ispainfully slow with a standard VGA card (MCS recommends a high-resolutiongraphics card with extra memory, and output quality is marginal at best).andM;Anvil's menu system, which combines text and icons, was designed as aconvenience for users, but on a standard-sized VGA monitor it's a hindrance.andO;The icons (20 sit on the fight of the screen) are extremely small; in fact,four of them are indecipherable.andP;  When you split the screen intomultiwindowed views the situation goes from bad to worse-either your textmenu blocks out the upper-left view or your drawing blocks out the menu.andP;  On19-inch screens these problems melt away; a monitor of that size isrecommended.andM;FEATURE-FILLED PACKAGE As a PharLap DOS-extended program, Anvil offers anextended geometry set with surface modeling, 3-D curves, 3-D splines thatinclude editable splines, mass properties analysis, built-in shading, Bill ofMaterials handling, and Anvil's own programming language, GRAPL-IV.andM;Our 3-D test drawing didn't come close to challenging Anvil.andP;  Since Anvil isa 3-D wireframe package, lines representing an object's edges need to beconstructed first.andP;  Once the wireframe of a part is complete, a surfacingoperation is usually required on the face of the object before it can berendered.andP;  I began with the base, drawing half of it and mirroring the rest.andM;You have to be careful about selecting the correct boundary lines for thesurface you are creating.andP;  If you pick the wrong line or the fight line atthe wrong place, your surface will resemble a pretzel instead of parallelline sets.andP;  The more complex the drawing, the more time it takes to createsurfaces.andP;  Anvil handles this tedious job well.andP;  Just position the cursornear your boundary during selection and press the letter &quot;L&quot; for line, &quot;E&quot; for end, &quot;P&quot; for point,  A&quot; for arc, and so on.andP;  Anvil will pick the closestmatch.andP;  This snappy feature is also available when you are drawing, editing,and manipulating.andP;  It's a real time-saver.andM;Anvil uses a two coordinate system.andP;  The first is the standard model or worldspace of x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0; the second is DCS (defined coordinatesystem).andP;  With wireframe or 3-D construction, your coordinate system's pointof origin must change as you draw a part.andP;  The ease of setting up differentpoints of origin and activating them makes or breaks a 3-D package, and Anvilprovides an effective approach.andM;Once a DCS is created, a transform representing its point of origin and axisorientation is displayed on the screen and activating a second DCS makes asecond transform appear.andP;  Furthermore, by clicking your mouse on the DCS iconyou can switch from one point of origin to another.andM;Like AutoCAD, Anvil uses levels and tracks items by type: surfaces, lines,arcs, points, and so forth.andP;  This is a blessing when you need to perform massmanipulations, deletions, or changes.andP;  Any level or type of entity drawn canbe turned off and on.andP;  If necessary, just hit a couple of keys to blank allsurfaces or simply pick the modify-many icon to change all line types.andP;  Anvilalso provides a full set of drawing tools and snap commands.andM;Anvil can draw 2-D views efficiently and effortlessly, but there's no need tocreate something twice.andP;  Existing views of your 3-D drawing are projectedinto the Drawing Layout screen for detailing and dimensioning.andP;  There, anymodifications made to the 3-D drawing will be reflected in the 2-D drawing.andM;Anvil's drafting menu includes full associative dimensioning.andP;  When you move,copy, scale, or stretch an entity, the dimensioning will adjust to match thenew geometry.andP;  A full annotation symbol set is included, and ASCII text filescan be imported for notes.andP;  In addition, you have full control over leaders,text placement, tolerances, witness lines, precision, dual dimensioning, andseveral other features.andM;CHINKS IN THE ARMORandM;Anvil requires an 80386 processor and matching math coprocessor, a hard diskwith at least 10MB of free space after the program is installed, as well asat least 2MB of RAM.andM;Some chinks in Anvil's armor are noticeable in the package's handling ofvirtual memory.andP;  All DOS-extender programs require some type of virtualmemory space unless you have sufficient RAM to hold all of the executable,drawing, and overlay files.andP;  Anvil's virtual memory requirements amount tobetween 6MB and 12MB of empty disk space; this empty disk area is used forscratch files, temporary storage, and swapping.andM;But the problem isn't that Anvil requires this space; it's what happens whenyou run out of room.andP;  At start-up, Anvil checks your disk for sufficient freespace; if it's lacking the program refuses to run.andP;  That's file, but thingschange when you're close to-but still above-the reserved virtual disk spacelimit.andP;  The program loads itself into memory, but as your drawing grows insize and you move below the reserved disk storage limit, Anvil prevents youfrom saving your work.andP;  It doesn't matter that your disk has severalmegabytes of empty space-Anvil has put this on reserve and won't allowanything to be stored there.andP;  As far as Anvil is concerned your disk is full.andM;The same problem pops up if you push Anvil to its calculation limits (duringshading, for example).andP;  As the program begins to swap things to virtualmemory, you might find yourself locked up.andP;  You'll have to reboot, losingeverything since your last save.andM;In fairness, MCS does discuss the need for plenty of empty disk space in itsinstallation manual and in the README files on the installation disk, butthere's got to be a better way.andM;Other problems are minor irritants.andP;  For instance, the interface lacksuniformity in some of the submenus: in some menus the Return key completesyour choice and starts the command; in others, you must press the Return keyand then the O/C (operation complete) key.andP;  In still others, you need topress the O/C key or icon twice before anything happens.andM;You may also have a hard time getting used to having the Escape key act asthe erase key.andP;  I accidentally pressed it more than once, deleting plenty ofthe entities previously drawn in the process.andM;On the plus side, Anvil's installation is simple; the documentation andtutorial are excellent.andP;  The program is as powerful as a Mack truck andcarries more features than several of the other 3-D packages.andM;New users will like the icon approach.andP;  Old friends from other platforms willappreciate the familiarity of the interface and command set.andP;  And everyonewill approve of Anvil's open data structure, its ability to transferinformation across any platform, and its exceptional editing facilities.andO;Just make sure that you set up a vigorous disk maintenance routine, savedrawings religiously, and have the appropriate hardware.andM;AEC Architecture/engineering construction.andM;AliasingandM;A term to comes from signal processing, a subdiscipline of electricalengineering.andP;  Used in graphics, aliasing refers to &quot;jaggies&quot;-the stairlikesteps that make up a diagonal line on a raster display.andP;  Some displaysincorporate &quot;anti-aliasing&quot; circuitry, which reduces the visual impact of thejaggies without increasing resolution.andM;Associative dimensioningandM;The process whereby a program changes some dimensions automatically toreflect changes the user has made to a dimensioned object.andM;AttributesandM;Pieces of information embedded in a CADD drawing.andP;  They can be graphical,such as color, line type, and so forth, or nongraphical, such as part number.andM;B-splineandM;A mathematical representation for smooth curves.andP;  Compare Bezier curve.andM;Bezier curveandM;A kind of smooth curve defined by four points, two of which are theendpoints.andP;  The other two do not lie on the line of the curve but attract itduring interactive tracking, so that the shape of the curve is influenced bytheir location but retains a natural smoothness.andP;  Bezier curves are oftenused to design consumer products such as automobile fenders and other smoothobjects.andM;Boolean equationsandM;Applications of the set-theory operations of union, intersection, andcomplement to solid models.andM;BreakandM;To make gaps in a geometric object, usually creating new endpoints; forexample, removing an arc from a circle.andM;CADDandM;Computer-aided design and drafting.andM;CAEandM;Computer-aided engineering.andM;CAMandM;Computer-aided manufacturing, including numerical control (NC), robotics, andother applications of computers in the factory.andM;ChamferandM;To join or chop two perpendicular lines with another line.andM;Coordinate precisionandM;In digital computers, points in space are represented by discrete numbers.andO;The coordinate precision is a measure of how many such points can bedistinguished in a given unit of area Sometimes precision is expressed as alinear function, as in &quot;100 points per linear inch.&quot; Another way ofspecifying coordinate precision is in programming terms, as a numeric type:16-bit integer means that each axis can be divided into 65,536 parts (2 tothe 16th power); floating point means that each axis can be divided into avery large number of parts.andP;  There are various forms of floating-pointrepresentation, all of which can express values of 100 million or larger.andM;The coordinate precision of a CADD program is what determines whether you canrepresent small objects that are found within large areas.andP;  For example, in a16-bit integer system, if a plot of land that measured a mile on each sidewere represented in a drawing, the smallest object that could be representedin the same drawing would be .97 inches long.andM;Digitizing tabletandM;An electronic board with a stylus or puck pointer, connected to the computer.andO;Positioning the pointer corresponds to selecting a function on a menuoverlay.andM;DimensionsandM;Notations on drawings that indicate lengths and angles.andM;DitheringandM;The act of mixing pixels on-screen to simulate shades and colors that do notexist in the base palette.andM;DrawingandM;CADD drawings are close analogs of real drawings.andP;  They are 2-Drepresentations of objects, accompanied by notations such as dimensions.andO;Unlike a model, a drawing cannot be analyzed to determine the strength of thestructure depicted.andM;.DXFandM;Autodesk's external drawing exchange file format; widely used by othervendors.andM;Engineering drawing sizesandM;The five standard sizes are: A, 8.5 by 11 inches; B, 11 by 17 inches; C, 17by 22 inches; D, 22 by 34 inches; and E, 34 by 44 inches.andM;FEAandM;Finite-element analysis.andP;  A powerful way of analyzing physical shapes forstructural, thermal, and magnetic characteristics.andP;  Objects are representedby meshes.andM;FEMandM;Finite-element modeling or meshing.andP;  See FEA.andM;FilletandM;A rounded intersection between two surfaces, used primarily in mechanicalengineering.andP;  In 2-D design, a fillet is a curve connecting lines or arcs insuch a way that they are tangent to it.andP;  The counterpart in 3-D design iscalled a fillet surface.andM;Floating-point representationandM;A way of representing a number by a pair of smaller numbers; in this pair,the first (or mantissa) is to be multiplied by the base (usually 2 or 10)raised to the power of the second number (the exponent).andP;  Thus, 743,000 infloating-point notation would be 7.43/5, or 7.43 times 10 to the fifth power.andO;This technique makes it possible to represent numbers larger than the maximuminteger value of a single word in a computer.andM;GridandM;A matrix of dots or lines, with user-determined spacing, that can be used toalign drawing elements visually.andP;  Snapping allows you to use grids to forcealignment.andM;GroupandM;To link two entities temporarily for certain operations, such as moving orerasing.andP;  Some systems use &quot;windows&quot; for this purpose.andM;HatchingandM;A shading pattern made up of lines at specified spacings and angles.andP;  Thereare standard hatching representations for various materials-steel, aluminum,and so forth.andM;Homogeneous geometryandM;A way of representing geometry in CADD programming in which points, lines,surfaces, and solids share a common mathematical form, allowing a single setof manipulation routines to be used for all objects.andM;IGESandM;Initial Graphics Exchange Specification.andP;  A neutral (nonproprietary) CADDfile format defined in ANSI standard Y14.28.andP;  CADD software vendors supplyprograms that translate between their formats and IGES, permitting users tomove CADD files from one system to another.andM;ISOandM;International Standards Organization.andP;  &quot;ISO dimensioning&quot; refers to a set ofdrafting symbols for dimensions and rules for their placement.andM;Isometric ViewandM;A drawing of a 3-D object in which they axis is vertical and the x and z axesmake angles of 30 degrees with the horizontal.andP;  An isometric view is usedbecause it gives a measure of realism while permitting measurement with thesame scale along all three axes.andM;LayersandM;A way of organizing information in a digital drawing so that differentversions of the drawing can be viewed and worked on separately.andP;  You canthink of the process metaphorically as overlay drafting.andM;MacroandM;A collection of system commands that can be activated by a single code orbutton.andP;  Also used in some systems to refer to a  symbol.&quot;andM;MaskandM;To select geometry for exclusion from a subsequent operation.andM;MCAEandM;Mechanical computer-aided engineering.andP;  This usually means CADD plus FEA plussolids, with additional tools for facilitating the entire design process.andM;MirrorandM;To create a copy by &quot;reflecting&quot; an image of the original around an indicatedaxis.andM;ModelandM;A 3-D representation of an object within a CADD program.andP;  A model containsrepresentations of many of the object's attributes and can therefore beanalyze-say, using FEA tools.andP;  Contrast with drawing.andM;MRPandM;Manufacturing requirements planning.andP;  A computer-based method for determiningmaterials purchasing needs, based on orders and bills of materials.andM;NCandM;Numerical control.andP;  The control of machine tools through computers.andM;NURBandM;Nonuniform rational B-splines.andP;  A type of homogeneous geometry constrained toensure continuity among objects.andM;Orthogonal viewandM;A drawing in which a face of the object is parallel to the drawing plane, andthe projection lines are perpendicular (orthogonal) to the plane of thedrawing.andP;  A six-view orthographic projection is a standard mechanicaldrafting representation that provides views of the front, rear, left, fight,top, and bottom of the object.andM;PanandM;To view a different part of the image without changing magnification.andM;Polar coordinatesandM;A way of specifying location by means of angles and distances.andM;PolylineandM;A geometric entity consisting of a number of connected lines.andM;PrecisionandM;The number of points in the coordinate space, or along each of the axes.andO;This value determines how small an object can be represented in a given CADDsystem.andP;  See coordinate precision.andM;RasterandM;A way of representing pictures in digital form.andP;  The picture is subdividedinto pixels, or picture elements, which are like the tiles in a mosaic.andP;  Anumerical value is stored in the computer memory for each pixel, indicatingits color.andP;  All PCs have raster displays.andP;  Contrast with vector.andM;Relative and absolute positioningandM;When locational coordinates are keyed in, absolute coordinates are numberedfrom the origin, while relative coordinates are numbered fromelsewhere-usually from the last point entered.andP;  &quot;Place a point at x = 10, y =12&quot; is an instruction given in absolute coordinates; &quot;place a point at alocation 10 feet to the right and 12 feet up from the present point&quot; is givenin relative coordinates.andM;ScaleandM;The numerical relationship between the dimensions of the image and the actualobject.andP;  For example, architects often draw at a scale of 0.25 inch = 1 foot.andO;In CADD systems, it is usually possible to draw in &quot;real-world&quot; dimensions;then scaling is handled dynamically by the program and is transparent to theuser.andM;SnapandM;Snaps are like point placement magnets: a snap is a point on the screen towhich you can move any object you are placing.andP;  A CADD user might want tosnap an image to a point at the end of a line, to a midpoint, or to theintersection of two lines.andP;  Systems that have snaps usually allow the user toset the snapping range.andM;Solid modelingandM;Also called volumetric modeling and geometric modeling.andP;  Of the three mainforms of computer-based geometry-wire-frame, surface, and solid--solids arethe least abstract and hence the most realistic.andP;  But they are also the mostprocessor intensive to draw; interactive solid-modeling systems are thereforevery expensive.andP;  Only solids allow you to check interference and accuratelyanalyze the mass properties of the geometry.andP;  The two main types ofsolid-modeling systems are CSG (constructive solid geometry) and b-rep(boundary representation).andP;  A CSG system stores only Boolean equations; thesystem creates geometry by evaluating the Boolean expressions.andP;  A b-repsystem actually stores the geometry.andM;SplineandM;Technically, a parametric polynomial curve whose points obey certainconstraints.andP;  Used loosely to mean curve.andP;  See B-spline and Bezier curve.andM;Surface modelingandM;Required for NC models, surface-modeling systems demand more computationalpower than wireframes do and are less natural for designers to use, but theyare more adaptable than solids.andP;  Surfaces are often defined by sweeping onecurve along another.andP;  When shaded, surface models are indistinguishable fromsolids.andP;  But surfaces can be used to create objects within the computer thatare topologically impossible to build (like the ones in M. C. Escher'sdrawings), while solids cannot.andM;SymbolandM;A grouping of geometry and text can be named and stored as a symbol in mostCADD systems.andP;  it can then be recalled and placed in a drawing, at any scaleand angle.andP;  Many systems store only a reference to a symbol within thedrawing file, so that if the definition is changed, all drawings containingthe symbol reflect the change.andP;  Some systems also allow symbols to be&quot;exploded&quot; into their component parts, which then become like any othergeometry.andP;  Also known as a block or component; in some systems, a macro.andM;VectorandM;As an adjective, contrasts with raster.andP;  The vector approach to computergraphics entails the decomposition of images into edges; the program storesthe coordinates of the endpoints of each edge rather than the entire line.andO;All CADD systems store drawings and models in vector format.andP;  There arevector input, display, and output devices; a pen plotter is a vector outputdevice.andM;WindowandM;A &quot;virtual terminal&quot; giving the user an access port to the system or data.andO;Windows can be used in some systems to hold different drawings or models; inothers, only views of a single drawing or model can be simultaneouslydisplayed.andP;  Windows are also used in some programs as a mechanism forgrouping drawing elements.andM;WireframeandM;A computer representation of a 3-D object in which only the edges arerepresented.andP;  Contrast with surface modeling and solid modeling.andM;Witness linesandM;Lines extending out from a dimensioned object so that the dimension-labelingtext can be placed where it will be legible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
