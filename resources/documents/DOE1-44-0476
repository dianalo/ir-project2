From a comparisonof the copper and oxygen Auger spectra with the valence-band spectrawe conclude that the on-site repulsion U between the valence electronsis fairly high both on copper and oxygen sites. A strong satellite isfound in the copper 2p spectra, indicating a d{sup 9} configuration ofmost copper atoms. The shape of the oxygen 1s line is found to dependstrongly on the oxygen concentration. In both the occupied and unoccupiedstates as measured by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy and bremsstrahlungisochromat spectroscopy the density close to the Fermi level is verylow and the consequences hereof are discussed. From the room-temperatureoptical spectra we find evidence for metallic behavior and a longitudinalmode at about 0.8 eV which we interpret as a plasmon.</TEXT></DOC>
