A spokeswoman for the EEC Commission said the offer ``was not afundamental change'' in the U.S. desire to eliminate all farmsubsidies.   Reagan said Thursday the United States would be flexible about adeadline for abolishing farm subsidies. Until now, it had demandedsuch subsidies be stopped by the year 2000.   The Commission spokeswoman said the EEC seeks a reduction in farmsubsidies over the long term, not their complete elimination.   Reagan's speech was seen here as an attempt to ensure progress atthe Montreal talks due to begin Dec. 5.   The meeting will assess progress made to date in the four-yearUruguay round of trade liberalization talks within the 96-nationGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   That progress is to be discussed in weekend talks here betweenthe U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter, U.S. AgricultureSecretary Richard Lyng and top EEC officials.   On Friday, Yeutter and Lyng discussed other contentious tradeissues with their EEC counterparts, including EEC plans to banimports of hormone-treated meat from the United States as of Jan. 1and U.S. objections to possible EEC subsidies for the Airbusconsortium.   On Saturday the talks will focus on the Uruguay trade round ofthe GATT talks. Yeutter is in Brussels after having meetings inrecent days in West Germany, France and the Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
