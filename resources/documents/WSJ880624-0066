A Nomura spokesman said the plan is in response to new insider-trading legislation recently passed by the Japanese parliament. The move follows the recent announcement of a somewhat different plan by Daiwa Securities Co., also designed to prevent insider trading.    Nomura, Japan's largest securities company, will split the functions currently handled by the &quot;corporate department,&quot; which is responsible for maintaining customer relationships for most products and services.    Over the next several months, duties will be gradually divided, so that one section will be primarily responsible for underwriting and advisory services, while the other will handle sales and trading, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
