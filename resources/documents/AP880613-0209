Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., an opponent of converting themothballed Washington Public Power Supply System No. 1 nuclearreactor to defense use, said the report recommends against such aconversion.   The report, released by an advisory panel to DOE's EnergyResearch Advisory Board, seems to favor the Savannah River Plant inAiken, S.C. for the new production reactor, Adams said.   The proposed reactor would replace three Savannah River plantsthat now produce tritium for defense use. Tritium, a radioactiveisotope of hydrogen, is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons. Itdecays relatively rapidly and so needs to be constantly replenished.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the report favored SavannahRiver because its current reactor technology _ heavy water _ waschosen as the best type for producing nuclear weapons materials.   However, an executive summary of the report said: ``Each of thereactor types considered can meet the mission requirements of a newproduction reactor with varying degrees of risk as to cost andschedule.... Heavy water is the most mature technology. Otherswould require some research and development.''   The ``heavy water'' option is limited to defense use and couldwin favor ``by clearly separating defense missions from civilianuse,'' the report said.   The technology for recovering tritium from a converted WPPSSreactor does not exist, according to the report.   The DOE report, said Adams, ``says what I have said many times:If we need to produce tritium we should build a special reactordesigned for that purpose....   ``While these reports are preliminary, they only confirm mybelief that conversion of WPPSS No. 1 is the wrong option andshould not be pursued,'' Adams said.   But Sen Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash., a supporter of WPPSSconversion, said the report's conclusions were ``by no meansfinal.''   Evans said four of the advisory board's subcommittees arediscussing possible technology for the reactor.   ``Each subcommittee is inclined to sing the praises of itsparticular nuclear reactor technology. It's premature to speculateabout the final decision,'' Evans said.</TEXT></DOC>
