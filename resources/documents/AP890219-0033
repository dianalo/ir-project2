The legislators ``believe that the absurd ideological content of`The Transformers,' especially its promotion uristic cartoon about robotswho canalter their shapes to become cars, planes and weapons, and whobattle other evil robots.   The official Xinhua News Agency said it has been shown onShanghai and Beijing television in translation, and severalpublishing houses have issued picture books of characters from thecartoon.   U.S.-made toys of the cartoon characters also have been sold inChina for the ``excessively expensive'' price of about $270 per set_ nearly as much as the average Chinese worker makes in a year, thenews agency said.   The legislators who objected to the program and toys are membersof the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, whichmeets periodically between annual sessions of the full congress.   The reports did not say if any government department hadresponded to the appeal or if the legislators planned to push forthe whole congress to take some action on it.   The congress has had a real voice in drafting and approving lawsonly for the past few years, but legislation still is proposed bygovernment ministries or the ruling Communist Party, not individuallegislators.</TEXT></DOC>
