(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Searchers today found a 16-year-old youth whohad been stranded in his car for 2{ days on a snow-blocked road withonly a light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats for warmth inbelow-zero temperatures.   Towner County Sheriff Howard Soderberg identified the boy asBennett Stebleton of rural Egeland. He was returning Monday nightfrom Devils Lake, about 40 miles to the southeast, when heapparently became disoriented.   Overnight temperatures in the region had dropped to 20 degreesbelow zero or more.   Greg Mitchell of Rock Lake, a volunteer in the search effort,came upon Stebleton's car shortly before 11 a.m. today. The vehiclewas on a lightly travthat was blocked by a snowdrift.   The boy was coherent when he was rescued, but was badlyfrostbitten on his feet and hands, Mitchell said. He was listed inserious condieled rural road tion at Towner County Memorial Hospital inCando.   About 20 to 25 people, both officers and volunteers, helped inthe search, Soderberg said.   Stebleton had driven to Devils Lake on Monday to take his olderbrother to the Amtrak station there, Soderberg said. The brother wasgoing to Fargo to take a military pre-induction physical, thesheriff said.   Stebleton's parents were already in Fargo visiting a sickrelative, and discovered the boy was missing after th   ``I'm trying toinvest it wisely. I never had that much beforeand a couple of times I was down on hard times,'' she said,recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for $30 aweek.   John D. Flowers, an assistant high school principal fromBarboursville, W.Va., has followed a similar play-it-safe patternafter winning $2 million in the West Virginia lottery in the springof 1986.   Flowers, 40, who continues working but whose wife quit her job,said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house.On his accountant's advice, 10 percent was placed in a tax-deferredretirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his threechildren's college education.   A small amount was invested in mutual funds and short-termtax-free municipal bonds. Flowers, like some other lottery winnersinterviewed, has avoided stocks.   ``This has raised our overall standard of living and lowered ouroverall worry level,'' said Flowers.   Most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higherliving standard, long after the lottery checks cease.   Tax expert Jane Feola Scaccetti, who has counseled lotterywinners, says that can easily be done through diversifiedinvestments. But her first advice is that clients take things slow.   ``It's the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot ofmoney,'' said Ms. Scaccetti, a tax partner with the Philadelphiaaccounting firm Laventhol andamp; Horwath. ``You usually try to slow thepace down, apply all the sound financial decision process ... as youwould a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period oftime.''   For the first two years most lottery winners might want to keepthe money in high-yielding CDs or Treasury bills, Ms. Scaccettisaid. Some banks, such as Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, offerspecial accounts for clients who suddenly have $1 million or moreand need a place to park it.   Of course, lottery winners also should be looking for ways toshelter themselves from taxes, such as tax-free municipal bonds orannuities, Ms. Scaccetti said.   Later on, ``They need to ask themselves: `Do I need to have afixed return because I want to give up working, or do I want tocontinue working and put a fixed income amount set aside,'' she said.   Dick Zimmermann, 39, a former ABC News producer from the SanFrancisco Bay area, fell in both categories after winning $9.76million in the California lottery a year ago.   Although his annual net income of $500,000 has kept himself andhis wife out of the work force, they've been cautious.   Zimmermann opted for investments most likely to appreciate, likea new $425,000, 3-bedroom house and a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver CloudIII. For tax reasons Zimmermann obtained a 15-year home mortgagerather than paying cash.   ``We're trying to be good stewards of this money,'' he said.``After all, this sort of thing doesn't even come once in alifetime. Your chances of being struck by lightning are four timesbetter.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 5</NOTE></DOC>
