Antonio Ricardo Valle, a 32-year-old professor ofMarxist-Leninist studies at the University of Havana, revealed hisdefection at a news conference here.   He defected June 10 in the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, andwas given permission from the State Department to fly to Miami lastweekend, he said.   ``He didn't know, essentially, my political views,'' Valle saidof Garcia Marquez, who helped him obtain travel papers to Colombia.``He didn't know I didn't conform to Castro's system.''   Valle, who met Garcia Marquez at the home of a mutual friend inHavana, said the 1982 Nobel laureate is a ``very close friend ofCastro's.''   Garcia Marquez called two or three times a week to speak withthe leader of the communist nation and visited Valle on trips toCuba, the defector said.   ``He encouraged me not to fear being critical,'' Valle said.``But I would explain to him I had hundreds of pages hidden in myhome I knew would never be published because of politicalcensorship.''</TEXT></DOC>
