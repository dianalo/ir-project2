<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0804 </DOCNO><TEXT>The left ventricular asynchrony of both ejection and relaxation phasesas also their interrelationship are analysed at rest after Dipyridamole(0.44 mg/kg) in 27 patients without previous myocardial infarction andwith a normal ejection fraction at rest. The patients are divided inthree groups: G0: 13 patients with no coronary artery disease (CAD),G1: 7 patients with one vessel disease and G2: 7 patients with two orthree vessels disease. Two high temporal resolution sequential radionuclideventriculographies are obtained at rest and after Dipyridamole (36 imagesin LAO projection). No significative variations were observed for thedifferences rest-Dipyridamole for the three groups and regarding theparameters derived from the global left ventricular time-activity curve:peak emptying and filling rates (PER and PFR) and their correspondingappearing times in the cardiac cycle (TPER and TPFR* = time to end systole+ time to peak filling rate). New functional images representing thepixel by pixel distribution of the TPER and TPFR* are obtained, permittingthe determination of the corresponding histograms. The relative variationsrest-Dipyridamole of the full width at half maximum (dispersion) of theTPER histograms are different (pandless;0.01) between the control group G0 andthe CAD patients (G1 + G2), contrary to the dispersion of the TPFR histograms.Moreover there is as linear correlation (r = 0.74, pandless;0.01) between therelative variations rest-Dipyridamole of the TPER versus TPFR dispersionsof the CAD patients (G1 + G2). These findings suggest that the relaxationasynchrony in patients with CAD is a consequence of dysfunction of theejection phase.</TEXT></DOC>
