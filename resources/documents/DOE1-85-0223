Retrieval is an event that,although it is not expected, must be planned for. Both high-level programmaticdocuments and Federal regulations require that the waste should be retrievable.It is therefore an important design consideration that the option existsto retrieve waste in the unlikely event retrieval is needed. There areseveral broad issues involved in a repository in salt that have significantimplications to retrieval systems. Among these are high temperaturesthat can affect mining equipment operation and personnel safety; theviscoplastic behavior of salt that results in room closure and increasedpotential for unstable openings; and nuclear issues such as radiationand contamination, criticality, and accountability and safeguards. 31refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
