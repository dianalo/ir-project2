With the establishment of theUniversity Research Initiative in fiscal year 1986 and rising funds forthe Strategic Defense Initiative, the Department of Defense's investmentin university-based research is increasing. Consequently, the appropriationscommittees need to ensure that the peer-review process for the allocationof university funding is working effectively, and that mechanisms arein pace to broaden the base of DoD university research commensurate withthese increasing resources. Therefore, the conferees direct the Departmentof Defense to submit a report to the appropriations committees by March1, 1987, which (1) explains in detail the current peer-review processin a step-by-step fashion; (2) explains current participants in thisprocess, including peer-review panels, boards, or conferences, and howsuch peer reviewers are evaluated and chosen; and (3) an analysis ofthe potential for expanding the research base into geographical areaswhich at the present time receive little defense-related university funding.This report explains DoD's merit-review process and the participantsin that process and also describes the current distribution of DoD researchfunding to universities and the potential for geographic expansion.</TEXT></DOC>
