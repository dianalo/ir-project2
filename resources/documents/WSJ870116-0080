Reagan remains adamant against more taxes to help curb the deficit. But Senate Budget Chairman Chiles senses a new &quot;tenor&quot; in comments by top officials that suggests the administration might accept a small tax increase, though it wouldn't be called that. GOP Sen. Rudman of New Hampshire sees &quot;more accommodation at the White House this year&quot; than before.    One administration policy maker speculates that a beer-and-wine or telephone excise tax might be part of a budget compromise, but only if the Democrats agree to &quot;real cuts&quot; in domestic spending. A congressional staffer predicts that about $10 billion may be raised from new taxes.    House Democrats will hit the road next month to criticize Reagan's budget before deciding on their own budget plan.    CREDIBILITY PROBLEMS hit U.S. international-economic-policy makers.    News stories that Washington wants to drive down the dollar draw protests from West Germany and Japan; both had been promised a respite from U.S. pressures to stimulate their economies. Debtor nations express outrage over reports that senior Treasury officials now believe that some Latin American debt no longer is worth its face value.    Treasury officials try to correct both impressions, but their denials come out lame. &quot;They can't say they don't want the dollar to decline, because they'd be lying,&quot; one U.S. official says, but to say they do &quot;would suggest, erroneously, that they're trying to push it down faster.&quot; Some fear that further incidents could tarnish Treasury chief Baker's high standing abroad.    PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS compete to grab the trade &quot;competitiveness&quot; edge.    Among Democrats, Gephardt makes the issue part of every speech; he proposes to give the president new authority to negotiate reduced trade barriers against U.S. exports. Babbitt stresses his plan to negotiate a new international trade agreement. Biden talks vaguely of antitrust actions against unfair imports. Hart pushes export promotion.    The GOP's Kemp makes trade a major issue; he boosts a plan to withhold foreign aid from countries illegally subsidizing farm exports. Haig recommends &quot;market development rather than 19th-century protectionism.&quot; Dole urges an aggressive stance against unfair trading practices but &quot;no protectionist wall building.&quot;    &quot;No one's talking about free trade,&quot; says Dole, &quot;because nobody has free trade.&quot;    THE CLAIROL CONNECTION? People who have read the Senate Intelligence Committee report on Iran say that it cites a CIA memo referring to an independent effort by former Secretary of State Haig to establish Iranian contacts. The effort &quot;blew their mind&quot; at the CIA, the report says. The reason: It was &quot;via an Iranian hairdresser in Europe.&quot;    THE VOLCKER BANDWAGON picks up speed. Five House Banking Committee members write Reagan urging him to reappoint the Fed chairman to a third term. The three Democrats and two Republicans say that Volcker's &quot;name has become synonymous with vigilance&quot; against inflation and that for economic stability at home and abroad, &quot;his presence is needed more than ever.&quot;    SQUEEZE PLAY: The EPA and Michigan Rep. Dingell press to dilute air-quality standards. Otherwise, they suggest, new factories may have to be banned and auto use curbed in areas such as the Los Angeles district of Rep. Waxman, whose subcommittee has blocked easing. Waxman now plans hearings on the issue.    HOLD THE PHONE: As the leadoff speaker at Senate hearings on trade, former Trade Representative Robert Strauss fervently stressed the need to help the U.S. telecommunications industry gain access to foreign markets. It wasn't until the questioning period that Strauss volunteered he now lobbies for ATandamp;T.    HOPES RISE among consumer groups for more support in Congress.    With Democratic Senate control, such groups are &quot;optimistic that the issues important to us will at least receive significant consideration,&quot; says the Consumer Federation of America's Alan Fox. New Banking Chairman Proxmire plans hearings on a bill to limit check holds. Sen. Dodd, head of a consumer panel, will propose regulation of credit-card advertising.    Commerce Chairman Hollings is expected to quash efforts to ease product-liability laws. Sen. Metzenbaum, chairman of an antitrust subcommittee, will examine the insurance industry's antitrust exemption. He also will propose giving state regulators more power over multistate frauds. High pharmaceutical-product prices also may get congressional attention.    Nobody expects a rush of consumer legislation. But after a six-year lull, &quot;there's a kind of a backlog syndrome building up,&quot; says Ralph Nader.    MINOR MEMOS: Patrick Buchanan says that if he runs for president, his campaign slogan will be &quot;Why not the Beast?&quot; . . . Taking revenge for being called &quot;San Francisco Democrats&quot; by the GOP, liberal Democrats now refer to the &quot;Tehran Republicans.&quot; . . . The Capitol Hill Squash and Racket Club runs an ad in Roll Call noting that all six of the club's congressman members who were up for election last fall won. </TEXT></DOC>
