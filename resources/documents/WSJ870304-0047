Government Securities stunned municipalities and thrifts across the country that had invested with the firm. The scheme that Jose L. Gomez helped perpetrate initially cost investors about $320 million.    But perhaps nowhere was the damage greater than in Ohio.    &quot;When in March '85 I saw the tragedy of the Ohio depositors, that really hurt,&quot; Mr. Gomez says. &quot;This is something I had never looked at -- whose money is being played with here. That caused me a great deal of pain and sorrow. I don't know that that comforts them any. I don't think it would.&quot;    When the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a court order to close E.S.M. on March 4, 1985, it was disclosed that Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank would likely suffer heavy losses from its dealings with the firm. Beginning March 6, depositors began a run on the thrift, withdrawing more than $150 million and forcing Home State to close three days later.    While a conservator was appointed to sell the ailing thrift, Ohio legislators authorized a new $60 million insurance fund; a $136 million privately financed deposit insurance fund for 71 state-chartered savings and loans was considered inadequate.    But the state's move failed to calm depositors, who began massive withdrawals from state-chartered thrifts. On March 15, following all-night meetings with banking regulators, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste invoked emergency powers to close the 71 thrifts for at least three days. It was the first bank holiday since the Depression. All the Ohio thrifts were eventually required to obtain federal insurance.    Since then, the E.S.M. debacle has prompted two suicides: Stephen W. Arky, a prominent Miami lawyer who represented E.S.M. on various matters, and Henry Earl Riddel, a former E.S.M. officer who was convicted of fraud.    Six E.S.M. officers and Mr. Gomez have pleaded guilty to various charges, and four others have been convicted of felonies in two trials. One man was acquitted. Most recently, on Monday, an Ohio state jury convicted Marvin L. Warner, the owner of Home State, and two former top officers of charges related to Home State's failure. Mr. Warner and a former bank officer also face felony charges in federal court in Ohio in May.    Grant Thornton, Mr. Gomez's auditing firm, has paid about $80 million to settle suits against it. The firm is appealing a federal court decision in Fort Lauderdale that it must pay $36 million to E.S.M. creditors for negligence. And it still faces litigation by the Ohio Deposit Guaranty Fund and the liquidator for Home State, which lost about $147 million through its E.S.M. investments.    &quot;Had I looked at the depositors as the ones being ultimately hurt, this would have been a different decision on my part early on,&quot; Mr. Gomez says today. &quot;If this had been a case of somebody setting out on a scheme to defraud a bunch of people of their retirement money, it wouldn't have lasted a year because I would have stopped it. But what made it easier to accept was, yeah, (E.S.M.) lost some money playing in the market, but I never looked at it as not being their money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
