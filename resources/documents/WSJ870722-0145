The party's popularity was demonstrated Monday when it won three parliamentary by-elections, two in districts that had been Conservative strongholds.    The New Democrats are highly critical of U.S. domestic and foreign policies. The party says it would break off Canada's current negotiations with the U.S. to dismantle trade barriers, halt U.S. testing of cruise missiles in Canada's north, withdraw Canada from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and curb U.S. takeovers of important Canadian industries.    The left-wing party's strength may force the Mulroney government to proceed more cautiously with policies such as the sale of government companies, analysts say.    The New Democrats' surge is attributed partly to the popularity of their leader, Ed Broadbent, and partly to deep disenchantment with Mr. Mulroney's scandal-plagued government and with John Turner's indecisive leadership of the Liberal Party.    Mr. Mulroney has been trying to undermine the New Democrats' support by drawing public attention to the party's more-radical policies. Conservative Party headquarters mailed a fund-raising letter to supporters, warning that the New Democrats, if elected, would establish a &quot;Soviet style&quot; government.    New Democrat leaders, seeking to project a more-moderate image, are considering dropping some of their more-extreme proposals. Party leaders also are trying to restrain their most far-left members. Mr. Broadbent scolded three members for heckling President Reagan during a speech to Canada's Parliament in April.    Canadian financial markets so far have shown little reaction to the New Democrats' strength, partly because the Mulroney government has two years left in its mandate.    Michael Manford, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., said the rise of the New Democrats has been overshadowed in the equity market by the robust performance of the Canadian economy and the sharp rise in corporate profits in recent months.    The New Democrats fared badly in the last election, capturing only 30 of 282 seats in the House of Commons. Analysts of all parties agree that the next election will be a much closer contest, with a strong prospect that none of the parties will win a parliamentary majority. </TEXT></DOC>
