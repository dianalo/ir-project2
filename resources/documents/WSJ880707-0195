Tannenbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CRZYE </CO><IN> BBK </IN><TEXT>   Balky debt holders have stalled a crucial refinancing at Crazy Eddie Inc., but the troubled electronics chain said it expects an agreement to end the impasse this month.    At stake is the Edison, N.J., company's offer to exchange new convertible debentures for an existing debt issue. That issue has a face value of $81 million, but its market value recently has been less than one-third of that amount.    As of Tuesday, the original deadline for the swap, the offer had attracted debentures with only about $7.2 million of face value, Crazy Eddie said as it extended the deadline for the swap to 5 p.m. EDT Aug. 1.    The company said it was negotiating with holders of a majority of the existing debt over a possible &quot;restructuring of the terms&quot; of the proposed new debt. Chief Financial Officer Frank Fuino declined to be more specific.    As originally planned, the new debentures would have a shorter maturity, lower conversion price and higher interest rate than the existing 6% debt, but Crazy Eddie would gain the option of paying interest of 7% in stock instead of 6.25% in cash.    The proposed swap would do much more than possibly save $4.8 million a year in cash. Because the market value of the new debentures would exceed the book value of the old ones, Crazy Eddie's balance sheet would reflect an estimated $38 million gain on the transaction.    After posting losses of $109.1 million for the year ended Feb. 28, Crazy Eddie showed an $18.7 million &quot;current deficiency in net assets,&quot; or negative net worth. Crazy Eddie's new auditor, Touche Ross andamp; Co., has said the asset deficiency, operating losses and legal problems &quot;raise substantial doubt&quot; about Crazy Eddie's &quot;ability to continue as a going concern.&quot; But dressing up the balance sheet through the proposed debt swap would help the company keep and increase its bank and vendor credit lines, Crazy Eddie has said.    Moreover, Crazy Eddie needs to improve the balance sheet, through the debt swap or otherwise, by Oct. 3, or face the dropping of its securities from the National Association of Securities Dealers' Automated Quotation System, or Nasdaq. As of last month, the company failed to meet certain Nasdaq requirements, but was granted a temporary exemption. </TEXT></DOC>
