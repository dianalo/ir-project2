Trading activity was moderate, picking up the pace from Mondaywhich was the slowest trading day of the new year.   Stock prices had risen in three of the past four sessions aftersinking for most of the month of January.   Some analysts said today's decline was an indication that themarket's broader trend is still lower.   The prospect of rising interest rates has inhibited recent pricegains, making yields on short-term Treasury securities morecompetitive with those available on stocks and dimming chances forcorporate earnings growth.   Those worries grew more pronounced as the Treasury's auction of$30 billion in new securities approached this week.   In the credit markets today, rates edged up on six-monthTreasury bills while yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the8.56 percent level from 8.53 percent late Monday.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
