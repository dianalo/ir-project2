The company, which makes specialty glass and ceramics, telecommunications and houseware products, said it will invest $40 million in the plant in order to increase U.S. production capacity for cellular-ceramic products. The Blacksburg facility made specialized glass for technical applications before closing in 1984. Production is expected to begin late next year. Employment will reach 175 when the plant is in full production by the end of 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
