But the Rev. Donald Wildmon, head of the American FamilyAssociation, called Bakshi's decision a victory for his group.   ``This is a de facto admission that indeed Mighty Mouse wassnorting cocaine,'' Wildmon said from his Tupelo, Miss., office.``We have been vindicated by CBS itself.''   Wildmon on Monday also demanded Bakshi's removal as producer ofthe Saturday morning cartoon and reiterated his call for the firingof Judy Parker, CBS-TV's vice president for children's programming.He asked for a public apology by the network because of the April23rd episode, titled ``The Littlest Tramp.''   CBS said the cartoon has been rerun twice and will be shownagain, but no date was given.   The 11-minute episode involves Mighty Mouse's efforts to savePolly, ``a poor but industrious flower seller,'' from a villain whodestroys her flowers.   Just before vanquishing the villain, Mighty Mouse either sniffscocaine (according to Wildmon) or inhales the aroma of flowers ``intypical cartoon fashion'' (according to CBS).   ``Mighty Mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because ithelped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly,''said Bakshi, creator of the X-rated ``Fritz the Cat'' animatedmovies in the 1970s.   ``But even if you're right, their accusations become part of theair we breathe. And that's why I cut the scene. I can't havechildren wondering if Mighty Mouse is using cocaine.''   Bakshi said the work of the American Family Association ``is thesame thing'' as McCarthyism.   ``The principal thrust of this episode is to show the redeemingquality of love and kindness,'' said CBS Entertainment PresidentKim LeMaster in a statement supporting Bakshi. ``There is nothingin the story line, the dialogue or the behavior of Mighty Mousethat would suggest otherwise.''   Wildmon last year pressured CBS into scrapping plans for acartoon based on the ``Garbage Pail Kids'' cards.   Other targets of the fundamentalist preacher have been the``Bloom County'' comic strip, and adult magazines like Penthouseand Playboy. The 7-11 and Stop-n-Go convenience store chainsdropped Penthouse and Playboy in part due to pressure from Wildmon.</TEXT></DOC>
