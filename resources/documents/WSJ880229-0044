Mr. Robertson's reports show him preparing for what appears to be a much more expensive effort, and a big legal battle. His rivals George Bush and Robert Dole, struggling to stay within the limit, are sure to accuse him of breaking the federal election law, something he'll just as surely deny. Several election-law experts say Mr. Robertson's legal strategy is dubious at best, but that election-law enforcement is so weak that he can probably get away with it.    &quot;I think it's brilliant,&quot; says Jan Baran, Mr. Bush's legal adviser. &quot;I feel like Horatio at the bridge when every living soul at the Bush campaign is looking over there and saying, 'Hey, why can't I do that?'&quot;    The Bush and Dole campaigns are spending at rates that will consume two-thirds to three-quarters of their legal spending allowance by Super Tuesday, leaving them strapped for resources during any protracted struggle afterward.    But Mr. Robertson had already spent nearly 80% of the limit, which applies to operating and fund-raising expenses, as of Jan. 31, the cut-off date for his most recent report. Furthermore, he was going through money at an average of nearly $200,000 a day in January. If that rate continues, his campaign will be well over the limit before the Super Tuesday contests on March 8.    &quot;Obviously, sooner or later a decision will be made,&quot; says Mr. Robertson's campaign lawyer, Marion Harrison, adding that the choice is between halting spending or &quot;opting out&quot; of the limit. He says the campaign hasn't yet decided which to do, but Mr. Robertson shows no signs of turning off its expenditures.    The strategy being considered is to repay the more than $6 million the campaign has accepted from the U.S. Treasury. Taking those federal matching funds triggered the spending lid, but Mr. Harrison says that by paying the money back, the campaign could argue that it no longer is bound by the limit. Mr. Harrison calls it &quot;a fascinating legal issue, the kind lawyers like to chew around.&quot;    Other election-law specialists, both Democratic and Republican, say Mr. Harrison will have a hard time selling that argument to the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Robertson did put his federal funds in an escrow account when he accepted them, and hasn't spent the federal dollars themselves. But his lawyer confirms that the campaign pledged the federal money as collateral for $5.5 million in bank loans that it used to finance its heavy spending in December and January.    &quot;I'd love to be on the other side of that argument,&quot; says Michael Berman, a Washington lawyer who helped run Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign. &quot;They've used that money; they've used it for collateral.&quot; Republican lawyer Daniel Swillinger, adviser to Pete du Pont's defunct campaign, also says Mr. Robertson probably can't deactivate the limit now. &quot;I think he's stuck,&quot; he says.    Furthermore, Mr. Robertson's debts exceeded his cash balance by $430,000 on Jan. 31. So if he wants to return the federal money, his only option seems to be to find a friendly banker who will lend him the $6 million without collateral, on the strength of his predicted future receipts and his prodigious reputation for raising money when he was in the television religion business. Mr. Harrison says the campaign is in fact thinking about borrowing to repay the federal money.    That in itself would be legally risky. Federal law prohibits banks from lending to federal campaigns except &quot;on a basis which assures repayment,&quot; wording which at least some FEC commissioners interpret as requiring a firm pledge of existing collateral. The commission sued Ohio Sen. John Glenn's 1984 campaign for borrowing $2 million without collateral. On the other hand, the FEC settled the case for a $4,000 fine against the Glenn campaign, which it hasn't paid to this day. The banks weren't fined at all. The Glenn campaign still owed the banks $1.2 million at the end of last year.    As a practical matter, election-law experts agree, the election commission would be powerless to stop Mr. Robertson. The law is so full of procedural safeguards for politicians that no action would be possible before Election Day, and probably not until long afterward.    Meanwhile Mr. Robertson could gain a big spending advantage over Messrs. Bush and Dole, particularly in some of the delegate-rich states that hold contests after Super Tuesday, including New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. His reports show he is investing heavily in direct mail and such promotional items as video and audio cassettes, apparently building up a base of small donors to whom he can appeal again and again for funds.    &quot;Eventually, it becomes a cash cow,&quot; says Mr. Baran. &quot;This guy operates on a scale we have not experienced before in politics.&quot;    Mr. Robertson's rivals, meanwhile, are resigned to living within the limits. &quot;We would hope all candidates would abide by the law,&quot; says Scott Morgan, legal adviser to Sen. Dole. And Mr. Baran says, &quot;Maybe Pat Robertson can get away with this kind of stuff, but George Bush cannot. He's the vice president of the United States. It becomes a political problem.&quot;    To comply with the federal limit, they may have to curtail frills such as the Bush campaign's $5,000 consulting payment last month to George W. Bush, the vice president's son, or the $2,852 paid by the Dole campaign to two limousine services.    More important, the limit will force the Dole and Bush camps to make strategic decisions as to where they restrict their outlays. &quot;You decide whether you're going to buy time in North Carolina or California,&quot; explains Mr. Morgan, the Dole adviser. &quot;Do you try to save more for the long run? It's a very fluid decision. . . . Everybody would like to go out and buy a Mercedes or a Cadillac, but you just have to stay within your means.&quot;    Mr. Robertson might have to pay a political price for exceeding the lid, but probably not among his own ardent followers. And his lawyer doubts it would hurt him among the wider electorate, either.    &quot;I would doubt that it would cause much of a ripple,&quot; says Mr. Harrison. &quot;Pat is either going to expand beyond the base ascribed to him or he isn't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
