NASA spokesman Ed Medal said it had not yet been determined ifthe outdated ring was used in the two boosters attached to thespace shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launch Sept. 29, butpreliminary investigation showed it had not.   ``There's no indication that the old configuration is in theboosters (in Discovery). But we've got to go ahead and check therecords and clear that,'' Medal said.   ``We certainly don't believe the situation will impact thelaunch, though,'' Medal said at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centerin Huntsville, Ala., which oversees the booster rocket contract.   Asked how the ring with the old design might have been installedon the test rocket, he said, ``We're taking a long, hard look athow the old ring got there. One of the leading possibilities is across labeling of parts.''   Medal said it is necessary to check records because actuallysearching through Discovery for the ring would be too difficult.   ``We are going through the records and checking to clear theboosters for flight. If one of the old inlet rings was there, therewould be no safety issue for flight. The old design workedperfectly well on all space shuttle flights. The modification was avery minor one,'' Medal said.   The ring, located inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of theshuttle booster, was redesigned for production models of the solidrocket motors.   But for some reason the nozzle installed in the Aug. 18 testbooster contained a ring of the old, pre-Challenger design, Medalsaid.   ``It is true that a nozzle forward nose ring, not of theredesigned solid rocket motor design, the RSRM design, wasinadvertently installed in the PV-1 (Production Verification Motor,fired Aug. 18),'' said Ed Snow, a Morton Thiokol spokesman atOgden, reading a prepared company statement.   ``The forward nose ring performed satisfactorily. The error wasdiscovered during regular post-test examination and analysis of thepart. NASA and Morton Thiokol are working to discover how the errorwas made and how it can be prevented in the future,'' the statementsaid.   Medal said he believed the mistake was discovered within thelast day or two.   Barbara Selby, a spokeswoman at NASA headquarters in Washington,said space agency officials now are concentrating on trying todetermine if the old ring, or the redesigned ring was installed inthe rockets on the launch pad.   She said no decision would be made about the effects on thelaunch until this was known, but added: ``When I left, they didn'tthink it would cause a postponement.''   A firm decision on that may come on Thursday, she said.   ``We fully believe the correct parts are in the flight set,''company spokesman Rocky Raab told the Associated Press. ``We andNASA are researching the record, the documents, to make sure theyare the correct parts. Even if they were not, they would not affectthe safety of the flight.''   Raab said the discovery was made during X-ray analysis of thepart after the test firing. ``There is no visible differencebetween the two parts,'' he said.   Raab said the search would include X-rays of the nozzle rings onthe Discovery booster and engineers should have an answer withindays.   ``We expect to be able to tell that by two days before launch,and perhaps sooner, but certainly by then,'' he said.   The Aug. 18 test, the fifth full-scale static firing of theredesigned booster, was conducted at Thiokol's Wasatch Operationsplant 25 miles west of Brigham City under NASA and Thiokolsupervision.   After the test, engineers disassembled the rocket and began alengthy process of examining it. NASA later pronounced the test asuccess and certified Discovery for launch.   Most of the booster redesign was aimed at making the rocketsafer. A faulty O-ring seal on one of the booster segments wasblamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttleChallenger, which grounded the nation's manned space program.   Medal said that uder the old design, the flame from the rockethit the ablative carbon cloth fabric on the ring at an angle of 90degrees. Under the new design, it hits at an angle of 45 degrees.   ``That's slightly improves the ablative tolerance of the ring,''he said.   An ablative substance melts off in layers when hit by the rocketflame, protecting the ring and preventing it from burning through.   He said these parts are not marked for technical reasons. ``Theold design ring certainly did not affect that test in August,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
