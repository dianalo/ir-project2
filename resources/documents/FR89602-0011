Further, a significant part of the interpretedhistory of the unit is related to the Gold Rush and its influences on thearea during the mid-1800's. The park now allows gold panning as part ofan interpretive program. However, to allow panning outside of a structuredinterpretive program and to allow visitors to retain minimal amounts ofgold as an enhancement of this experience, the National Park Service proposesthis rulemaking pursuant to the Unit's enabling legislation at section6.The existing National Park Service (NPS) general regulations at 36 CFR2.1(a)(1)(iv) that pertain to the preservation of natural resources restrictthe possessing, removing and/or digging for any mineral resource. Theseprovisions apply at the Whiskeytown Unit of the National Recreation Area.However, the enabling act for the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National RecreationArea, Pub. L. 89-336, section 6, provides the Secretary of the Interiorwith the authority to permit the removal of nonleasable minerals from landswithin the recreation area in accordance with the Reclamation Act of 1939(43 U.S.C. 387).The regulation provides the conditions under which the recreational goldpanning will be allowed. It stipulates registration requirements, locationswhere the activity will be allowed, and controls on the equipment, materialsand methods by which the gold panning may occur.A proposed rule was published February 9, 1988, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 3759) to allow for this activity. An editorialcorrection was published March 8, 1988, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7466) to clarify the methods of takinggold from ``any method'' to ``any other method.'' No other changes in thefinal rule from the proposed rule have occurred. During the 30-day commentperiod that expired March 10, 1988, one supporting comment was receivedfrom the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recommending that the permit systemadopted by the NPS be similar in nature to that utilized by BLM on adjacentlands.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information    </ITAG>The primary authors of this regulation are Ray C. Foust, Superintendent,and T. Dwayne Collier, Chief of Visitor Services and Law Enforcement Operations,both of Whiskeytown Unit, Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity NRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act   </ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws   </ITAG>An environmental assessment of the effects of this proposed regulationwas prepared and submitted to the Regional Director, Western Region, NationalPark Service, in July, 1987. A statement of a ``Finding of No SignificantImpact,'' in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42U.S.C. 4332), was prepared in conjunction with the environmental assessmentin July, 1988.   The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 (February 19, 1981), 46 FR 13193,and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). While this rulemaking has no economic effect, it doesrelax one existing NPS regulation, 36 CFR 2.1(a)(1)(iv), that restrictsthe possessing, removing and/or digging for any mineral resources.   An Assessment of Actions Having An Effect On Cultural Resouces was conductedin accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470,<T3>et seq.</T3>, it was determined that the proposed activity will nothave an adverse effect on cultural resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 7   </ITAG>National parks, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.In consideration of the foregoing, 36 CFR Chapter I, Part 7 is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 7_SPECIAL REGULATIONS, AREAS OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM   </ITAG>1.
