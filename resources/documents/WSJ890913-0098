Under the Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program, any enterprising foreigner willing to invest at least a quarter of a million dollars in a new business in an economically depressed area would be awarded an immediate visa. The prospective immigrant would be required to create at least five new jobs for U.S. workers and would have to agree to operate in the depressed area for at least five years.    A confession: This is not an entirely new idea. Canada has had a business immigrant program for almost 10 years and the Kennedy-Simpson immigration bill, which passed the Senate in July and soon will be taken up by the House of Representatives, would allow 6,800 investor immigrants into the U.S. Two thousand visas would be reserved for immigrants willing to invest at least $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise with at least 10 employees in a disadvantaged rural or urban area. Championing the idea are Sens. Phil Gramm (R., Tex.), a conservative, and Paul Simon (D., Ill,), a liberal.    But there's really no reason to limit the number of entrepreneurial immigrants at all. If 2,000 such immigrants are good for the country, why not 10,000?    The American public's main criticism of immigrants has always been the dubious claim that they take jobs from U.S. workers. Those entering the U.S. under the entrepreneurial immigrant program would be making jobs, not taking them.    By requiring a minimum $500,000 investment, however, the Senate bill would prevent many people with more modest amounts of capital from starting small businesses in parts of the country where jobs are in short supply. Small businesses often start with an initial capital investment of far less than $500,000. Thus, the proposed alternative Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program would require a start-up investment of only $250,000, about the amount required under Canada's program.    Would such a program work? In Canada, the &quot;Business Immigrant&quot; program is working well. According to Canada's Employment and Immigration Office, in 1988 alone 3,258 foreign entrepreneurs -- predominantly Asians -- invested nearly $2 billion in new businesses, creating nearly 15,000 jobs for Canadians.    These new ventures were not just restaurants and corner grocery stores. Many of the immigrants started firms in manufacturing, financial services, textiles, computer services and export-import. Residential real estate is not considered a commercial enterprise under the program.Canada's former minister of state for immigration, Gerry Weiner, has quipped that the U.S. would be doing Canada a great favor by keeping the American immigration system &quot;exactly like it is.&quot;    One criticism of such an Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program for the U.S. is that it would invite more foreign investors to buy up American assets. This fear of foreign investment -- several bills under consideration in Congress aim to regulate the flow of capital into the U.S. -- is grounded in xenophobia, not economics.    If anything, the Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program would reverse the &quot;problem&quot; of foreign investment. The whole idea is to attract foreign investors who want to live here and want to become American citizens. Today, many of these people can't gain visas, and the profits from their investments flow abroad. The Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program would put the profits from these new enterprises to work here.    Others object to the investor immigrant program because they claim that it would permit wealthy foreigners to &quot;buy their way past the Statue of Liberty.&quot; But is a successful entrepreneur less deserving of a visa than a foreigner with a Ph.D., or the brother or sister of a U.S. resident or a farm worker -- three groups that now receive preferential treatment under immigration law? If the U.S. must ration visas, why not give at least some consideration to those who will provide immediate benefits to U.S. citizens?    Over the past three decades Congress has tried dozens of approaches to revitalize decaying urban and rural areas, usually without success. It spent nearly $5 billion on the Urban Development Action Grant program; the program became little more than a political slush fund and was mercifully defunded in 1988. Despite an annual $3 billion budget, the Community Development Block Grant program has similarly failed, as has the 25-year-old Appalachian Regional Commission, which spends about $100 million a year, targeting much of its aid to counties that have unemployment rates far below the national average.    To its credit, Congress is now reassessing how best to stimulate economic activity in distressed areas. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's push for enterprise zones, which offer tax and regulatory relief to investors in decaying areas, is one new approach that holds promise. The Entrepreneurial Immigrant Program is similarly promising.    ---   Mr. Moore is a fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the Heritage Foundation. </TEXT></DOC>
