In mid-October 1990, I was well on my way to being electedthe Republican governor of Minnesota. Twenty days before thegeneral election, charges were leveled against me by twowomen who claimed that at a July 4 party nine years earlier,I swam nude with them and attempted to touch the breast ofone of them.</LP><TEXT>   Given the political connection of the women, I neverbelieved the media would take the charges seriously. When itbecame apparent that the Minneapolis StarTribune would printthe charges and not even wait a few days to interview allwitnesses, I knew immediately that my life would never be thesame. My wife, my children and all those associated with mewould also have their worlds dramatically turned upside down.   The very nature of an 11th-hour charge of sexualimpropriety against a public figure is impossible to defend.In my case, I took a polygraph exam and passed without onepolygraph expert disputing the results. I brought forwardnearly 20 witnesses who signed affidavits to counter thecharges against me. I did so because with the 11th-hourcharge there is no court to hear your case; you will be triedin the court of public opinion. Sex-related charges are sotantalizing to reporters and editors that the chance of afair hearing is nearly impossible.   I challenged my accusers to take a polygraph examination-- they refused. When my accusers were asked if they wouldbring civil or criminal charges against me, they said no.When asked to make public their telephone records, they saidno.   Yet repeatedly I was asked, &quot;Why would the women lie?&quot; Theburden of proof was on my shoulders and I was withoutrecourse because of the manner in which public figures havelimited legal protection under the First Amendment.   My popularity and favorability rating nosedived in thepolls despite the fact that the same polls showed nearly 70%of all Minnesotans believed the charges against me to bepolitically motivated. A clear plurality believed me, but asizable minority didn't know whom to believe. The environmentof doubt had been created.   The political motivations of my accusers were much betterestablished than those of Anita Hill, but once again I amchilled by the war cry of &quot;Why would she lie?&quot; Especially,when I hear it from those in the legal community.   The American political process has now firmly entered adangerous new era. The 11th-hour charge is an old campaigntactic that has often backfired. Now, armed with sex as aweapon, opponents need not worry about defeating you on theissues. When the charge of sexual impropriety is launched,the very nature of the charge eliminates the probability ofwitnesses.   You are permanently tainted and forced into the impossibledebate of the never-never land of &quot;yes, you did-no, Ididn't.&quot;   These types of charges are rarely resolved, especiallywhen a feeding frenzy ensues. What is left, however, is thedangling corpse of a public figure whose character willalways be in question. Or as my wife put it, &quot;In SouthAmerica they assassinate their political leaders withbullets; here we kill you, but you're still alive.&quot;   There are real victims in our society, victims of rape,incest and sexual harassment. These are serious issues thatdemand serious policy responses. Using sex as a weapon whendue process is impossible or denied just creates a new classof victims.   So how do we as a society prevent the total destruction ofour political process without trampling all over the FirstAmendment or the rights of real victims? The answer is noteasy. It requires restraint mostly on the part of the media,whose societal interests must extend beyond a good story andratings wars.   Those who are politically motivated have learned the gamewell -- it is pathetically easy to get the media to bite on asex charge. Editors and reporters need to insist that thosebringing 11th-hour charges of sexual impropriety come armednot merely with an affidavit (that does little more thanprotect the media outlet from litigation), but that theaccusers be willing to file formal civil or criminal charges,as well as take polygraph tests before the charges are madepublic; that the accusers do so at least 30 days before thescheduled election or nomination, or the story will be heldover until after the election. It is not a perfect solution,but it restores some element of due process.   If a victim of sexual impropriety can wait for nine or 10years to bring forth charges that clearly would never havebeen made had the accused not sought public office, then theleast we should demand for the accused is a level playingfield -- which those who wrote the Constitution attempted toachieve. Failure to do so will only create tenfold a newclass of victims -- just ask my children.   Jon R.
