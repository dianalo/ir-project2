Sullivan, chairman of First Chicago Corp.,last year's hard times brought both good and bad pay news.   The bad news: a pay cut. Because of slumping profits atthe Chicago-based bank-holding company, Mr. Sullivan didwithout a bonus last year, thus cutting his cash compensationby 50%, to $735,632. The good news: Last year, the companygave him 65,000 stock options, as well as 25,000 restrictedshares valued at $662,500.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our senior people took a significant zap in terms ofannual pay,&quot; says Paul Knuti, vice president ofhuman-resources policy at First Chicago. But in bad times andgood, he adds, &quot;we want to provide them significant long-termopportunities. Then our shareholders will be happy, and wewill create some nice wealth for our senior management.&quot;   As Mr. Sullivan and others are discovering, hard times cutinto many executives' pay last year. Overall, chiefexecutives' salary and bonuses still rose, but the rate ofincrease slid for the second year in a row, to its lowestrate in five years. Many executives saw annual bonuses slipaway altogether as corporate profits faded.   But don't weep for anyone just yet. Behind the scenes,many companies continue to fatten executive stock plans. Thatmay not have boosted pay for 1990, but it set the stage forhuge pay gains in the future.   &quot;It is very safe to predict that if the stock marketremains strong, the gains reaped from {these} stock plans . .. will yield dramatic numbers in the mid- to late-1990s,&quot;says Michael Halloran, head of the executive-compensationpractice at compensation consultants Towers Perrin.   Of course, stock ownership implies risk, as stock pricesgo down as well as up. But most of these stock and optiongrants represent net additions to executives' compensationpackages, and their sheer size means that even very smallstock-price gains will translate into big paper profits.   That, at least, is the picture for the boss. For middlemanagers, the news last year wasn't quite so mixed. It wasunequivocably bad: For the first time in a decade, middlemanagers found their pay raises trailing inflation. As therecession slashed pay budgets, companies trimmed meritraises, postponed increases, froze salaries and in some caseseven imposed pay cuts. With the economic outlook stillcloudy, many organizations remain uncertain about this year'spay for middle-level executives.   One thing is clear, however: &quot;Any increase for the averageemployee is less of a sure thing than in the past,&quot; saysMarsha Cameron, a principal with Wyatt Co., a consultingfirm.   To look closely at the trend in CEO pay, The Wall StreetJournal asked Towers Perrin to survey the compensation ofchief executive officers at the country's biggest companies.In all, 352 proxy statements were sampled.   The survey showed that in a year when corporate profitsoverall slid by 6.8%, the median increase in CEO annualcompensation, including salaries and bonuses, was 6.7%,compared with 8% in 1989. The median CEO annual compensationin this year's sample was $981, 200.   In a year in which the overall stock market, as measuredby the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dropped by 6.3%, fewerchief executives exercised stock options. But those who didhad bigger gains. Last year, 101 executives exercised stockoptions or stock-appreciation rights, for a median gain of$485,800, compared with 114 executives and a median gain of$428,200 in 1989. The median total CEO compensation lastyear, including salaries, bonuses and long-term compensation,was $1.4 million.   The rate of increase in chief executives' annual pay wasthe lowest since 1985, when CEO cash compensation rose 6.1%in the face of a 10.8% corporate-profit slide. Last year, athird of the CEOs sampled saw their annual pay remain thesame or fall.   Largely because of bonus cuts last year, the gap betweenthe annual pay increases at the top and the middle of theorganization -- while still large -- narrowed for the secondyear in a row. At 6.7%, the rate of increase in CEO annualpay is only 1.5 percentage points higher than the change inmiddle managers' and professionals' salaries and bonuses. In1989, that gap was 2.9 percentage points, while in years pastit has averaged 4.7 percentage points.   The rest of the organization also had little to cheerabout. At 5.2%, the rate of increase in non-union employees'annual compensation trailed the 5.4% inflation rate. The lasttime this group's pay failed to keep pace with inflation wasin 1981.   The overall rise in CEO annual compensation in 1990 maskedbig variations among different industries. &quot;We are seeing amove away from the late 1980s, where it didn't matter whatindustry you were in as far as pay was concerned,&quot; saysTowers Perrin's Mr. Halloran.   In the troubled financial-services industry -- which had a7.3% drop in profits among surveyed companies -- the medianincrease in compensation was only 1.3%, and bonus cuts werecommon. Among chief executives hit by big pay cuts were: S.Parker Gilbert of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., who saw hisannual pay fall 63% to $2.8 million; PaineWebber Group Inc.'sDonald B. Marron, with a 54% drop to $950,000; and Hugh L.McColl Jr. of NCNB Corp., with a 53% drop to $700,000.   Non-cyclical consumer goods -- such as drugs and food --were strong last year, with surveyed companies posting amedian 14.2% profit gain. The median increase in CEO annualcompensation in that industry was 11.8%. Big gainers inannual pay in that industry included: Vernon R. Loucks Jr. ofBaxter International Inc., with a 20% increase to $1.8million; Raymond V. Gilmartin of Becton Dickinson andamp; Co., witha 25% gain to $729,100; and Richard D. Wood of Eli Lilly andamp;Co., with a 31% gain to $1.8 million.   Many see last year's intensified variation in pay as asign that the much-vaunted trend towards pay for performanceis finally taking hold. &quot;I definitely saw 1990 as a watershedyear in the pay-for-performance issue,&quot; says Ira Kay, whoheads the compensation-consulting practice for Hay Group inPhiladelphia. He adds: &quot;We predict that will continue. Thepoorer performing companies will continue to have declines incompensation {while} at the high end, they will continue todo extremely well.&quot;   Still, a growing number of compensation specialists insistthat the key facet of pay for performance is rapidly becomingstock ownership -- and not annual pay.   &quot;The future is more of a sense of shared ownership, whichmeans sharing the risk, which means having a piece of theaction,&quot; says Jude Rich, president of consultants Sibson andamp;Co. &quot;That's the major trend you will see in the next 20 yearsor so.&quot;   Thus, last year, 45 companies made so-called mega-grants-- defined as grants of stock options that exceed three timesannual pay, or grants of restricted stock that exceed onetimes annual pay. In 1989, 43 companies made such grants.Last year, the median stock-option grant was worth 1.5 timesannual pay, compared with 1.2 times annual pay in 1989.   By far the largest stock-option grant last year was thefour million-share grant to H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman AnthonyJ.F. O'Reilly. With a grant price of $29.88, the face valueof the grant was $119.5 million, or 115 times his annual pay.Each $1 rise in the price of the stock yields Mr. O'Reilly a$4 million gain on those options. With the stock tradingabove $39 this month, his paper profits already exceed $36million, although the options can't be exercised until 1995.At the time the board made the grant, one director termed Mr.O'Reilly &quot;a very rare executive.&quot;   Other big stock-option grants include a 2.5 million-sharegrant to Reebok International Ltd.'s chief executive, Paul B.Fireman, which substitutes for a cash-only pay arrangementthat last year resulted in $14.8 million in pay. Under thenew plan that went into effect this year, Mr. Fireman's cashcompensation will be capped at $2 million. Bristol-MyersSquibb Corp.'s Richard L. Gelb received a 310,000-share grantat $52.75, with a face value of $16.4 million.   As at First Chicago, hard times didn't discouragecompanies from adding significant stock options toexecutives' portfolios. At Scott Paper Co., where the annualpay of CEO Philip E. Lippincott dropped by 20% to $603,000, astock-option grant had a face value of $1.7 million, or 2.88times his annual pay. The company's regular program ofstock-option grants is &quot;fairly aggressive and has been thatway on purpose,&quot; says Roger Bobertz, vice president,compensation and benefits. &quot;Stock options are the clearestlink between executives and company performance,&quot; he says.   Indeed, hard times may actually be encouraging a move tostock payment. &quot;The pressure to pay for performance isconverging with another phenomenon: Economic problems wherecompanies are looking to save cash,&quot; says Robert Salwen, aprincipal with William M. Mercer Inc., compensationconsultants.   Even many relatively trouble-free companies are looking tostock as an economical way to save cash. &quot;As executive pay isgetting bigger . . . companies are looking for cost-effectiveways to dampen the growth in dollars,&quot; says Alan Ritchie,compensation and benefits vice president at General MillsInc., which last year formalized a new executive stock-optionplan that gives senior executives the choice of taking theirannual bonuses either in cash or in stock options.   Still, most pay-for-performance programs -- including onesthat greatly increase chief executives' stock holdings -- arecriticized by consultants as deeply flawed. For one thing,unlike the General Mills plan, which requires the executiveto trade off pay for stock, most plans are additions to pay.That means most plans are all reward, and no risk. &quot;There isa significantly different view of the ownership issue whenyou have paid something for {the stock} than when it issimply a grant,&quot; says Mr. Ritchie.   Stock plans also allow executives to benefit from a risingstock market, and not necessarily from superior corporateperformance. In February of this year, Ralston Purina Co.executives were awarded $49.8 million in stock -- including$16.2 million in stock for chairman and CEO William P.Stiritz -- as a reward after the company's stock priceremained above $100 a share for 10 consecutive days. Thatrepresented a 60% increase in the price of the company'sstock -- exactly the rate of increase of the Dow JonesIndustrial Average over the same period.   A Ralston Purina spokesman says the plan was valuablebecause the goals prompted other accomplishments, such aschanging the mix of the company's business. The plan was alsodesigned to retain key executives, the spokesman adds.   Some companies put in stock plans hoping for big payouts-- and when the payoffs don't materialize, they simply changethe rules. Among companies canceling so-called underwaterstock options -- options whose purchase price is below thestock's market price -- and replacing them with new,lower-priced options, were:   -- Teledyne Inc., which last May issued 370,000 executivestock options priced at $26, and by February of this year hadalready canceled and reissued them at $19.63. A Teledynespokesman declines to comment.   -- Apple Computer Inc., which repriced 11.2 millionoptions to $29.75, lowering the average exercise price forall 15.6 million outstanding options to $25.80 a share from$33.24. &quot;We wanted people to share in the growth and successof the company, so we wanted {the options} to be worthsomething,&quot; says an Apple spokesman.   -- Wang Laboratories Inc., which canceled 8.2 millionstock options originally issued at between $5.66 and $33.63,and reissued them at either $5.50 or $5.75. &quot;Because thestock had decreased in price, the options had lost much ofthe incentive value they were intended to create,&quot; says aspokesman. &quot;The canceling and reissuing renewed thatincentive.&quot;   Some executives and consultants argue that becausestock-based plans only pay off when the company does well,they reduce the resentment that high executive pay can causein a troubled organization. At Santa Fe Pacific Corp.'s majorrailway-operating unit, for example, all nonunion employeestook pay cuts in 1990, and everyone got stock -- from a500-share grants to secretaries to CEO Robert D. Krebs's260,000-share grant. &quot;We think if the economy recovers, withthe changes we have put in place the stock recovery could besubstantial, and we want that same thinking all the waydown,&quot; says Russell E. Hagberg, vice president, humanresources. &quot;Everybody has the same chance proportionately.&quot;   But innovative companywide plans can be much harder toimplement than ones at the top. Late last year, a Du Pont Co.unit canceled its experimental plan under which employees gotbigger pay raises when the business exceeded profit goals,but gave back part of the raises if goals weren't met. Theplan unraveled in its second year, as it became clear thatsome of the money at risk would be lost.   Part of the reason the plan failed, says Ben Wilkinson,manager of corporate compensation at Du Pont, was thatemployees didn't feel they could directly affect the companyresults that were dictating their pay. The other reason: Atlower levels, it's harder to put pay at risk. &quot;When you havepart of your college savings -- in your mind -- at risk, it'sa little more burdensome to carry around,&quot; Mr. Wilkinsonsays. &quot;It weighs on your mind.&quot;   Walter Wriston, former chairman of Citicorp, who now sitson a number of corporate boards, cites one company that hadto hurriedly adjust a lower-level pay-for-performance programwhen corporate profits plunged. &quot;You couldn't permit thoselower-level people to default on their mortgages, so we hadto readjust the plan, which was wrong to begin with,&quot; Mr.Wriston says. &quot;You can't penalize the people down below tothe point where they can't eat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
