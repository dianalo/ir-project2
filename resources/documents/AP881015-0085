(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an effort to preserve the survival of aspecies, six of the nearly extinct black-footed ferret will travelTuesday under strict sanitary controls to a pre-screened zoo for anew captive breeding program.   The tiny, weasel-like animals were among 34 kits born thisspring at the Wyoming Game and Fish department's Sybille Canyoncaptive breeding facility. The 58 there are thought to be the onlyblack-footed ferrets in the world.   ``The ferrets are doing real well, and we are at a situation nowwhere we feel we have enough ferrets that we can split the Sybillecolony,'' said Art Reese, chief of habitat and technical servicesat the game department.   The ferrets were nearly wiped out in late 1985 when an epidemicof canine distemper ran through their last known colony nearMeeteetse. Biologists managed to save only 18 of the rare animals.   As a result, officials had to be sure that the plane chosen tofly the six kits had not carried a cat or dog for at least severalmonths, Reese said in an interview Friday.   There also will be a 15-foot buffer zone around the ferrets onthe Wyoming Air National Guard plane where no one will be allowedto enter, he said.   Some 17 zoos around the country answered the game department'scall for captive breeding proposals, Reese said, but just three metstringent conditions the department imposed, which includes thatthe kits can't be put on display to visitors for fear of exposureto disease.   ``The overriding purpose (of sending the animals to other zoos)is captive breeding,'' he said. ``Ferrets are susceptible todisease and stress, and we didn't want to take that risk.''   Following a tour of the zoos, the department selected HenryDoorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb., and the National Zoo, just outsideWashington, D.C., in Front Royal, Va. The first six kits are flyingto Washington on Tuesday, and another eight will go to Nebraskanext month.   ``We only had enough young to go to two,'' Reese said, so thedepartment's third choice, the Minnesota Zoo in Minneapolis, wasturned down.   To win the ferrets, the zoos had to agree not to do research onthem without approval of both the Wyoming game department and theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and to fund the breeding program,Reese said.   When the next set of ferrets is taken to Omaha next month, theylikely will ride in a van specially conditioned and disinfected forthe purpose.   The precautions are in keeping with a stringent disease controlsystem at Sybille, Reese said.   Anyone going in to see the animals at the facility must firstshower and put on protective gear similar to a hospital isolationunit, he said.   ``It's worse than the Mayo Clinic, I think. That's because youhave all your eggs in one basket,'' Reese said. ``If disease didhit, you could face extinction of the whole species.''   Biologists are confident that spreading the population out tothe other two sites will put the department closer to its goal ofreintroducing the ferrets in the wild by fiscal year 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
