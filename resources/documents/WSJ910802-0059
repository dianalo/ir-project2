But sofar, most people who invested in them are doing just fine.   Many financiers who took companies private during the1980s in leveraged buy-outs (purchases of corporationsfinanced mainly with debt) now are selling shares in thesecompanies to the public. In Wall Street parlance, that's areverse LBO. It often allows the financiers to start cashingout, and it shores up companies' debt-laden balance sheets.</LP><TEXT>   The losers, cynics thought, would be the small investorswho bought the newly issued shares. After all, if thesmart-money types think it's a good time to sell stock,should you buy? Besides, the companies still carry sizabledebt even after the public offerings.   Maybe the cynics will prove right in the long run. Todate, though, stocks born in reverse LBOs have mainly risen.Highly indebted companies such as Filene's Basement,AnnTaylor Stores Inc. and Duracell International Inc. allhave gone public in the past four months, and seen theirstock soar in subsequent trading.   &quot;These are wonderful opportunities to invest in franchisesthat the public hasn't been allowed to touch,&quot; says DanielFrank, manager of the $220 million Special Situations Fund atFidelity Investments. Mr. Frank says he has bought five&quot;deleveraging&quot; stocks, and is looking for chances to buymore.   Deleveraging stocks hardly look like the traditional starsof the IPO (initial public offering) market. Their salesgrowth often is just a fraction of what's posted by fledglingtechnology companies. Their net income is skimpy. And most ofthese companies are using proceeds to retire debt instead ofto finance expansion.   But bulls argue that in the current financial climate --in which debt is out and equity is in -- reducing high-costdebt is sometimes the best possible use of new capital.Former buy-out companies don't need 20% sales growth to showbig earnings leaps in the next few years, says Fidelity's Mr.Frank. Smaller interest bills will be enough to sendper-share earnings soaring.   Skeptics warn that a deleveraging angle alone won't ensurea winning stock. Mariel Clemensen, head of junk-bond researchat Shearson Lehman Brothers, questions how long earnings cangrow if sales are flat, no matter how clever the financialengineering. And Jack Laporte, manager of T. Rowe PriceAssociates' $1.2 billion New Horizon Fund, cautions that &quot;aminor operating disappointment can be magnified many timesover by financial leverage.&quot;   Still, the idea of selectively playing the deleveragingtheme intrigues many on Wall Street. Robert Natale, anemerging-growth stock analyst at Standard andamp; Poor's, sayscompanies going public to pay off debt are larger andlonger-established than the typical IPO, and thus will have&quot;better staying power.&quot;   Already this year, nearly 30% of the record $7.4 billionin IPOs has been raised by former buy-out companies goingpublic. More such offerings are on the way, including stocksales by York Holdings Corp., Super Rite Corp. and Vans Inc.   Some grossly overleveraged companies may attempt publicofferings even though they still don't have their debt undercontrol, warns Dean Kehler, an investment banker at ArgosyGroup. Mr. Kehler and his colleagues have jokingly developedthe &quot;Argosy Spinner,&quot; a wheel of chance in which &quot;IPO&quot;alternates with &quot;Chapter 11&quot; (for bankruptcy law filings) asa way of showing which path an individual company will followif the deleveraging trend is taken to an extreme.   The most popular reverse LBO companies are those withstrong underlying growth. T. Rowe Price's Mr. Laporteparticularly likes AnnTaylor: the 190-store clothing retailerplans to open 85 more stores by the end of 1993. Thatexpansion, more than the debt-repayment angle, is the realappeal of AnnTaylor, Mr. Laporte says.   In a rapid turnaround, Super Rite Corp. plans to sellstock just two years after Rite Aid Corp. Chairman and ChiefExecutive Alex Grass and his son Martin bought the grocerywholesaler and retailer in a leveraged buy-out. Under thefather-son team's stewardship, sales have risen 27% to $961.8million. After a year of debt-laden losses, Super Ritereported a profit of $792,000 in the year ended last March.   Super Rite's interest expense has ballooned more thanfive-fold from pre-buy-out levels. No wonder: Debt is 99% oftotal capital. But the company hopes to pare that ratio to73% after a stock offering of 2.1 million shares at $15 to$18 each.   Such debt levels may be crippling in some industries. ButPaineWebber analyst Gary M. Giblen, says they are tolerablein the slow-growing but stable food wholesaling business. Helikes Super Rite's management and figures the debt will be&quot;chicken feed&quot; compared with that of two other highlyleveraged grocery chains, Kroger Co. and Safeway Inc. Sharesof both Kroger and Safeway have done well in the past year,despite giving back some gains recently.   Drawing interest as an economic-recovery play is York, anair-conditioning and refrigeration company taken private byCiticorp and Prudential Insurance Co. of America in 1988.York wants to sell stock at $21 to $23 a share; it earned 64cents a share in 1990 but would have posted pershare earningsof $1.43 if the debt-reducing elements of the proposed IPOhad been in effect then.   Analysts are divided about the best-known reverse LBO, RJRNabisco Holdings Inc. The tobacco and food company has twicesold shares to the public in the past year, first at $5apiece and then at $10. Its stock closed at $11.50 yesterday,a level that some analysts believe is getting pricey, giventhat operating profit growth has slowed and that analystsexpect pershare earnings this year to total only 35 cents orso.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst Kurt Feuerman likes RJRNabisco anyway. He concedes RJR is having a tough year indomestic tobacco but expects per-share earnings to surge to98 cents in 1993, aided mostly by debt reduction and lowerborrowing costs.   RJR is controlled by the buy-out firm of Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co., which in the past 15 months has also takenpublic Duracell, Safeway and AutoZone Inc. If the stockmarket remains strong, investment bankers say, KKR may rollout more public offerings in the next year -- most likelyStop andamp; Shop Cos. and Owens-Illinois Inc. Of those two, Stop andamp;Shop already is reporting net income; Owens-Illinois has beena laggard in KKR's portfolio to date.   How much life is left in the deleveraging trend? Some onWall Street think it could rival a big investment concept ofthe early 1980s, disinflation, as a multi-year investmenttheme. &quot;It would take $35 billion to $60 billion of newequity issuance over the next few years to return corporatebalance sheets&quot; to normal levels, says strategist StevenEinhorn at Goldman Sachs.   Another hint of the staying power of the deleveragingtheme lies in two recent career paths at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.Departed is the firm's champion of emerging-growth companies,Sorrell Mathes, who resigned last year to join a much smallerfirm. Gaining ground is a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.investment banker, Alison Mass, who lined up Merrill's twobiggest IPOs the past six months.   Ms. Mass's forte: helping highly leveraged ex-Drexelclients go public.</TEXT></DOC>
