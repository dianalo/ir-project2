Richard Celeste signed into lawFriday emergency legislation that enables the state to assess theeconomic impact of takeover bids by foreign corporations.   The law, which takes effect immediately and expires July 1, wasprompted by Campeau Corp.'s billion bid to acquire or merge withFederated Department Stores, Inc., Celeste said.   Campeau is headquartered in Toronto; Federated is based inCincinnati.   ``With the help of this bill, we will use every resourceavailable to investigate the impact of this offer and take whateveraction is necessary to prevent the loss of jobs in the Cincinnatiarea,'' Celeste said.   Separately, Campeau Chairman and Chief Executive Officer RobertCampeau cautioned that any attempt by Federated to enter intoagreements with other firms would be met with a ``vigorous legalchallenge.''   In a letter to Henry Kravis of the leveraged-buyout firm ofKohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., Campeau noted that it has been``widely reported'' that KKR has expressed interest in Federated.   Campeau said the firm ``cannot enter into such arrangementswithout our having a full and fair opportunity to compete with anyoffer you make, including providing us with any informationprovided to you or any other third parties.''   Under Ohio's new law, foreign businesses trying to acquire anOhio business are required to disclose financing plans and anyintent to sell the target company's assets to pay for theacquisition.   Companies must make the disclosure to the Department ofDevelopment, which is then authorized to conduct an economic impactreview and also can involve other departments, including commerceand taxation.   ``This legislation protects target corporations with aconsiderable presence in Ohio by requiring bidders to explain theirfinancing plans,'' the governor said.   Celeste said serious questions have arisen about the amount ofdebt involved in the transaction.   John Chester, a Columbus attorney representing Federated, saidThursday that enactment of the bill should send a signal toToronto-based Campeau that Federated has obtained some of theprotection it wanted.   A companion bill requested by Federated effectively has been puton hold. The measure would have expanded Ohio's existinganti-takeover law to include certain non-Ohio corporations licensedto do business in the state.   But lawmakers said there were substantial constitutionalquestions and other concerns about the bill.   Campeau's $5.4 billion, $61-per-share offer to merge withFederated was made as an alternative to its outstanding $4.2billion hostile tender offer.   Federated employs about 16,000 people in Ohio, and has a payrollof $237 million annually.</TEXT></DOC>
