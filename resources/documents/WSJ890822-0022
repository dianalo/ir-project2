The stake has a market value of roughly $110 million.    The two men founded the company together, and Mr. Vajna also holds a 36% stake.    An official of Carolco said Mr. Kassar is negotiating the sale because &quot;he would prefer to have a bag of cash instead of the pressure and stress in building a large public company.&quot; Mr. Kassar declined to comment on the possible sale of his stake. A person close to the company said Mr. Kassar, who was Hungarian born, separated from his wife five months ago and wants to spend more time in Hungary.    The Carolco official said another party has expressed an interest in the stake but declined to identify the party. Together, Messrs. Kassar and Vajna hold 22.4 million shares. Carolco has almost 30 million shares outstanding.    Separately, Carolco posted a 78% drop in second-quarter profit. The company said that it released two major action movies in the year-ago period, including &quot;Rambo III&quot; and &quot;Red Heat.&quot; The company didn't release any movies in the 1989 second quarter. The company said the results, therefore, were fully in line with expectations and should pick up in the current half.    In the second quarter, net income fell to $2.6 million, or nine cents a share, from $11.9 million, or 38 cents a share. Revenue slumped 53% to $34.2 million from $72.8 million.    Messrs. Kassar and Vajna have co-produced many of the company's pictures and have been involved primarily in the production side of the business. Peter Hoffman, president and chief executive officer, runs the company on a day-to-day basis.    Carolco said three films are set for release in the third and fourth quarters: &quot;Johnny Handsome,&quot; &quot;Music Box,&quot; and &quot;Mountains of the Moon.&quot; Carolco also has the world-wide distribution rights to &quot;Lock Up,&quot; which stars Sylvester Stallone and opened in August. A spokesman said the company's first-quarter release, &quot;Deep Star Six,&quot; which did meagerly at the box office, has only recently been released on videocassette. The company said it also is anticipating &quot;an important contribution&quot; from Live Entertainment, a home-video company in which it holds a 49% stake.    In composite trading in the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Carolco shares closed at $9.75, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
