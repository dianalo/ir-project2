MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakisis likely to find that Jesse Jackson's political blessings are notalways unmixed.   Jackson can be a difficult ally despite his pledges of supportat the Democratic National Convention. He showed that four yearsago, when it took public coaxing to persuade him to campaign forthe ticket.   For Jackson, campaigning is a permanent work in progress. Evenas he promised to work for the ticket, he said: ``Our charge todayis to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon itas the vision for the next campaign.''   As the Atlanta convention ended, the most formidable blackpresidential candidate in history stood with Dukakis and vicepresidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, winners and losers together inthe traditional show of unity.   So he had stood four years before, with Walter F. Mondale. Then,as now, Jackson told the convention he would support its nominee.It took him a while.   After the cheering was over, Jackson said he wasn't satisfiedwith the role and status the Mondale organization had given him andhis supporters. It took six weeks and a post-conventionreconciliation conference to produce his unqualified endorsementand set him to work, campaigning for his cause and for the ticket.   In 1984, Mondale promised that black Democrats would have keyroles in his campaign and in the party hierarchy. Jackson said hewanted more specific commitments. Jackson also said he wasn'tlooking for a job or a title for himself _ a statement he hasrepeated in Atlanta.   After the Democrats broke camp in San Francisco four years ago,Jackson broke ranks. He said the Mondale campaign had no strategyand no themes to win the black vote. He said there were not enoughblacks or other minorities on the campaign staff.   Mondale showed his irritation, remarking that he had appointed aJackson adviser as a deputy director of his campaign and even thatdidn't help.   Jackson kept saying he wanted to support the ticket, but had todo so ``with integrity and self-respect, and I must be able toconvey a message of hope to the people I represent.''   Those themes, too, became familiar in Atlanta.   Jackson said he certainly will work for the ticket, ``But insome sense the relationship I will have with the campaign must bedefined by Gov. Dukakis.''   Dukakis has been defining it all week with praise for Jacksonand with assurances of roles for him and his allies.   In his acceptance speech, Dukakis praised Jackson as ``a manwhose very candidacy says to every child _ aim high; to everycitizen _ you count; to every voter _ you can make a difference; toevery American _ you are a full shareholder in the American dream.''   So far, Jackson has responded in kind. ``While I may disagreewith both Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Bentsen on some important issues,our interests converge in building a coalition to beat theRepublicans this fall,'' he said Thursday night. ``We will all berepresented in the fall campaign councils, and I will make surethat the progressive agenda remains an integral part of theDemocratic vision.''   Dukakis held his summit with Jackson the day the Atlantaconvention opened, met with him during the week, and has kept theirstaffs in frequent contact.   Jackson won a promise of a dozen new seats for his supporterswhen the Democratic National Committee meets today. There is to bea vice chairman for minority voter registration. He won a change inparty rules, to tie future delegate apportionment more directly toprimary election results. He got some of what he wanted in theparty platform.   That's not bad for the loser, but there could be more on hislist. Jackson was meeting today with his delegates and supportersto take stock and look ahead. He will be launching a politicalaction committee to raise funds and work for minority candidates,in voter registration and, in waiting, for the next Jacksoncampaign.   While Dukakis has worked at unity and conciliation, he also hasindicated that there are limits, and that he is not yielding theparty command he won with the nomination.   He needs Jackson, but not at any price. Dukakis is not inMondale's position. Four years ago, the Democratic ticket trailedhopelessly behind Reagan. Dukakis is dealing from strength; heleads in early polls.   Republicans already are claiming Dukakis has made Jackson aDemocratic boss. One GOP spokesman, Gov. James Thompson ofIllinois, said Dukakis made Jackson ``his partner'' and gave him atleast as much clout as Bentsen will have. It's all part of theRepublican effort to depict Dukakis as a liberal in centristdisguise.   Any renewal of the 1984 scenario would play into that GOPstrategy. Dukakis won't let it happen.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R. Mears is executive editor of TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
