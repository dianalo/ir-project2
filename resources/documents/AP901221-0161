About 700 Christians gathered Friday for a three-hour publicworship meeting in the heart of Katmandu. Previously, they wereforced to worship secretly in unmarked halls and private homes.   Last year, 14 Nepalese Christians were arrested for singingcarols at Patrang Bari in southeastern Nepal. All were sentenced tosix years in prison by the government, then a divine-right Hindumonarchy.   Following pro-democracy protests last spring, King Birendra wasreduced to a constitutional monarch and freedom of worship wasallowed.   The jailed Christians were released in June under a generalamnesty by the new government.   The National Bible Society estimates there are about 50,000Christians in Nepal. About 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million peopleare Hindus. Most of the rest are Moslems and Buddhists.   Nepal's new constitution still forbids the conversion of Hindusto other faiths.</TEXT></DOC>
