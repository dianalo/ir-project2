Recent disclosures depict a clear change in the character of Jet Capital Corp., an obscure, closely held investment company through which Mr. Lorenzo and a tight circle of associates hold voting control of Texas Air. Once operated from Mr. Lorenzo's desk drawer, Jet Capital recently has broadened its ownership base, opened an office in New York and hired a noted takeover specialist for purposes that Mr. Lorenzo and Texas Air executives refuse to discuss. The disclosures were made in Texas Air filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in its latest stock prospectus.    After buying Continental Airlines, Eastern Airlines, People Express and Frontier Airlines -- all in the past half-dozen years -- Mr. Lorenzo could use Jet Capital as a platform for a new series of acquisitions, former associates speculate. And although the idea seems far-fetched, there is even speculation that Mr. Lorenzo and his associates could use Jet Capital as a vehicle for a leveraged buyout of the Texas Air empire -- the largest airline holding company in the free world -- and its $8 billion of assets. Texas Air's market value currently totals about $1.5 billion.    &quot;You just never know about Lorenzo,&quot; says a former associate. &quot;This is the era of going private.&quot;    The ownership of Jet Capital began expanding last year when Robert Carney, formerly president of Texas Air, sold his one-third interest in Jet Capital for $11 million to Mr. Lorenzo and Carl Pohlad, a prominent Minneapolis investor who is a close associate of investor Irwin Jacobs, also of Minneapolis. Texas Air later sold some of the Jet Capital shares it held to several top executives and two outside directors of Texas Air, and to Douglas Tansill, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    Currently, 49% of Jet Capital is owned by Mr. Lorenzo, about 27% by nine associates, and the remaining 24% by fewer than 100 other investors.    Several of the Texas Air executives, while purchasing interests in Jet Capital, have sold millions of dollars of Texas Air common since last fall. A Texas Air spokesman said the executives sold their Texas Air shares to finance their Jet Capital stock purchases and their planned relocations to New York, where three of them will join a financial specialist who was recently hired as Jet Capital's first full-time employee.    Jet Capital's hiring of Kevin S. Moore as president last month is all the more intriguing, considering that his experience and qualifications seem far beyond those needed to head a company that has only Texas Air securities -- unless Mr. Lorenzo has big plans in store. Mr. Moore wasn't available for comment. The 32-year-old Mr. Moore helped coordinate a dizzying series of leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions as an adviser to William F. Farley of Chicago, who bought Northwest Industries Inc. in a $1.4 billion leveraged buyout in 1985. Mr. Moore helped in the Northwest Industries buyout and in the sale of part of that concern as a publicly held company, Fruit of the Loom Inc.    Mr. Moore is a shrewd judge of merger and acquisition candidates, according to a former associate at Mr. Farley's company, Vice Chairman Jack Albertine. &quot;He's very bright and very creative,&quot; Mr. Albertine said. &quot;He's a guy who's got exceptionally good financial instincts.&quot; Mr. Moore has worked closely with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which financed many of Mr. Farley's highly leveraged transactions and which also is one of Texas Air's investment bankers.    Whatever Mr. Lorenzo intends for Jet Capital, he was apparently eager to recruit Mr. Moore. According to the prospectus, Mr. Lorenzo made available nearly $1.4 million in Jet Capital shares for a stock incentive and purchase plan for a &quot;recently employed executive.&quot;    One of Mr. Lorenzo's most impressive achievements in assembling the Texas Air empire has been his success in maintaining control of it all through Jet Capital. Texas Air is a publicly held company with about 38 million shares outstanding, and Jet Capital holds about 23% of the airline company's &quot;general voting power,&quot; according to the prospectus. But Jet Capital also owns 100% of a class of Texas Air stock that has the power to elect three-quarters of the company's directors.    Though Texas Air's recent disclosures contain only broad hints about Jet Capital's activities, they suggest that Jet Capital has been used mostly to buy and hold Texas Air stock and to make investments jointly with Texas Air. Jet Capital is the successor to Lorenzo Carney Co., which was founded in 1966 by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Carney, the former Texas Air president, who were Harvard Business School classmates, on an investment of $1,000 each. Later, the two men each chipped in an additional $25,000 to form Jet Capital, which proceeded to raise $1 million through a stock offering. In an era when airline takeovers where unheard of, Messrs. Lorenzo and Carney acquired then-failing Texas International Airlines in 1972.    Jet Capital also has functioned lately as an anti-takeover device for Texas Air. According to Texas Air filings with the SEC, Jet Capital last year bought stock in Eastern Airlines before Texas Air announced its bid to acquire Eastern. Texas Air said in the prospectus that such joint investment arrangements are intended to repel any defensive attempt by a Texas Air target to respond with a takeover bid for Texas Air. Also in these arrangements, Jet Capital had a profit of $150,000 in the Eastern transaction, for example, and $291,900 from other joint investments that weren't specified, according to the prospectus.    Texas Air insiders who have most recently obtained interests in Jet Capital include Thomas Plaskett, president of Continental, and Donald Burr, a Texas Air executive vice president and former People Express chairman, who received loans from Texas Air to help finance the purchases.    For his part, Mr. Lorenzo's interest in Jet Capital is an asset of potentially greater value than his direct interest in Texas Air. To the extent that either company may have major transactions in the offing, Mr. Lorenzo would participate through Jet Capital as a 49% owner, but through Texas Air as a 4.8% shareholder. </TEXT></DOC>
