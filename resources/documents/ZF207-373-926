(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jeffrey FrentzenandM;As more and more corporations and government agencies adopt CD ROM publishingas a means of distributing data, text-retrieval software-development packagesfor CD ROM are becoming increasingly sophisticated.andM;Apart from the ordinary indexing and data-formatting features found in suchpackages, image-retrieval capabilities have become standard fare in theseproducts, as more commercial and in-house corporate developers integrate textand graphics on their CD ROMs.andM;&quot;More [CD ROM] applications are needing images,&quot; said Mike Befeler, vicepresident of strategic marketing at Reference Technology Inc., a CD ROMretrieval-software vendor in Boulder, Colo.andM;&quot;Users do their research on text and also want to bring up images andgraphics,&quot; he added.andM;Some products, such as CD Answer from Dataware Technologies Inc. andSearchExpress from Executive Technologies Inc., have image retrieval builtin; others offer it as an optional add-in software utility.andP;  Examples of thelatter include TextWare from Unibase Systems Inc. and Full Text Manager fromReference Technology.andM;Users reported that most CD ROM text-retrieval products do essentially thesame thing.andM;&quot;Most products have most of the features you need.andP;  It's just a matter offinding the best mix of features for your [CD ROM] applications,&quot; claimed JayTindall, a multimedia project manager who has developed interactive CD ROMapplications at Reactive Systems Inc., a promotion firm in Teaneck, N.J.andM;In producing a CD ROM, developers must first import text and graphics fromword processors, document processors, spreadsheets and other files stored onmagnetic media.andM;Text and graphics in hard-copy form must be converted to electronic formusing a scanner.andM;This data is then converted (or formatted) to conform to the file structureof the CD ROM.andP;  The text-retrieval engine processes data tags, buildsindexes, designs the user interface and compresses and encrypts the data.andM;Most retrieval packages can be customized by the developer and tailored to aparticular application.andM;Image retrieval involves compressing graphics files (usually in CCITT Group 3or Group 4 fax format) for later storage on the CD ROM.andP;  The developer thencreates a cross-referencing system for text and images.andP;  The retrieval enginewill perform decompression automatically when the user calls an image fromthe CD ROM to a computer terminal.andM;Preparing DataandM;At the data-preparation stage, most text-retrieval packages involve a degreeof customization.andP;  However, few require that the CD ROM developer actuallywrite original code.andP;  Their programming interfaces are largely menu-drivenand easy to use, according to users and vendors.andM;&quot;On the whole data-preparation side, you do need to understand how the datais going to be used,&quot; said Befeler.andM;&quot;For example, you might have an encyclopedia and break it down to title,author and actual text.andP;  It's not exactly programming, but someone has toprepare data.andP;  That includes scanning any images and processing the [text]and images,&quot; he explained.andM;Text-retrieval software doesn't necessarily have to be customized if thedeveloper takes the package as-is, said Befeler.andM;&quot;Some programming may be needed to create a unique look and feel to the frontend,&quot; he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
