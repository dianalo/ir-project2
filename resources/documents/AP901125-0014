Food sometimes isharder to find than in the starvation days of Communistdictatorship.   ``Life is surely more miserable now than under Ceausescu.'' saidPascu Dumitrescu, a 68-year-old pensioner, pointing to empty stallsin a public market. ``The shops are a reflection of our lives.''   After a long search, Dumitrescu found a store that had bread,waited in line with other sullen shoppers and bought a bag of staleloaves.   ``People will no longer stand it,'' said an angry man of 60.``They are going to take to the streets again, but this timethey'll be demanding food.''   When the government imposed price increases Nov. 1 to push thecountry toward a market economy, it agreed to freeze the prices ofsuch basic food items as bread, milk and meat until Jan. 1.   It also temporarily froze rents and energy prices.   Controlled prices don't make food any easier to find. Poorlypaid store employees sometimes sell subsidized food to blackmarketeers. The government said last week it would prosecute anyonecaught doing so.   Leather shoes, underwear and spare auto parts are a onlymemories. Refrigerators, televisions, radios and toilet paper areimpossible to find without special connections.   Romanians endured years of harsh rationing under Communistdictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who exported everything possible inorder to pay off the foreign debt.   When they began the protests last December that led to hisdownfall and execution, many assumed prosperity would followautomatically.   The new National Salvation Front government diverted foodintended for export to domestic use after the revolution. That,combined with donations from the West, created the illusion ofrelative plenty at the beginning.   It didn't last. Even though prices are higher now, shops offerthe same paltry selection of food, most of it canned, as they didunder Ceausescu.   In the farmers' markets, where food is available, sellers raisedtheir prices long ago without waiting for the government.   Marian Nitu, the deputy agriculture and food minister, estimatedin an interview that food exports totaled about $20 million so farthis year.   Along with livestock, he said, ``vegetables, fruits and cannedbeef'' were going to buyers in the West and Far East. All are hardto find in local markets.   Nicolae Tache, director of the public market where Dumitrescuwas shopping, said meat had not been available for more than a weekand blamed what he called a corrupt government distribution system.   ``I have to bribe for delivery contracts to be honored,'' hesaid.   At another market in the main Bucharest district of Pajura, morethan 50 people lined up for butter. Others waited silently forsmall rations of sugar.   Rumors that a milk van was arriving spread through the crowdandanother long line formed at the milk shop.   The only available meat was six pig feet, coated with fine hairsand laid out on a dirty shelf in a food shop that also offered2-year-old cans of squash, vegetable puree and spinach.   Most shoppers bought half-filled bottles of mineral water. Thedriest summer in years added tap water to the list of scarcecommodities.   For most Romanians, it will be another Christmas without theturkey, pork, fresh feta cheese, apple cake and wine some rememberfrom better times.   ``I am terrified by the coming days,'' said Maria Radoi, one ofthe shoppers.</TEXT></DOC>
