The agreements, with the Nigerian government and NigerianNational Petroleum Corp., allow Mobil to begin one of thebiggest petroleum developments ever in that West Africancountry.</LP><TEXT>   The project is expected to yield about 100,000 barrels ofcondensate a day soon after production begins in early 1993.The oil company and the country, a member of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries, have both been careful topoint out that the crude-like hydrocarbons are condensaterather than oil. That means the production won't be countedas part of Nigeria's OPEC quota.   A Mobil spokesman called the Oso condensate &quot;a goodhydrocarbon that refines easily into light products,including gasoline.&quot; Such condensates and light crudes tendto carry a premium on world energy markets.   The Oso field has nearly 500 million barrels of reserves,Mobil estimated. Mobil Producing Nigeria, the companyaffiliate, owns 40% of the field and is its operator.Nigerian National Petroleum owns the other 60%.   The Oso field development calls for construction of eightoffshore platforms, a condensate pipeline and storage tanksand other facilities. Mobil, a New York-based oil and energyconcern, said a $400 million construction contract for theproject was awarded to an international consortium ofcompanies including McDermott International Inc. of NewOrleans.   A McDermott spokesman confirmed the contract and said thecompany, which specializes in offshore energy constructionprojects, was named to do &quot;a little over half&quot; of theconstruction work, which will also include a naturalgas-gathering system. Mobil Producing Nigeria plans to injectnatural gas from Oso and from other nearby fields that Mobiloperates into the Oso project to maintain reservoir pressure.   Financing for the project came from the World Bank andInternational Financial Corp., a World Bank affiliate.Nigeria has had occasional difficulties funding its majorityinterests in such programs, at times making payments withcrude oil instead of currency. But World Bank officials saidthey were backing the Oso project because of its &quot;enormouspotential.&quot; Industry estimates put annual revenue from theproject at $600 million.   The Oso field is 35 miles offshore from the Qua Iboeterminal that Mobil operates. The condensate pipeline willlink the two, and the condensate storage tanks will be at theterminal.</TEXT></DOC>
