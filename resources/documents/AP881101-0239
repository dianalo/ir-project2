(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Delaware judge on Tuesday orderedPolaroid Corp. to give investor Roy E. Disney the names andaddresses of workers who participate in an employee stock plan,handing Disney a minor victory in his battle to buy the instant filmcompany.   The ruling by Delaware Chancery Court Vice-Chancellor CarolynBerger, if unchallenged, would ease the way for Disney to promotehis hostile $2.6 billion buyout offer to Polaroid employees.   The ruling was announced here late Tuesday by Disney's ShamrockHoldings Inc. The case is in Delaware court because that is wherePolaroid is incorporated.   A spokeswoman at Polaroid's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass.,Marcia Phillips, would not comment when asked if Polaroid wouldappeal the decision.   Polaroid's new employee stock ownership plan, created as part ofa recent restructuring, is seen by some as an anti-takeover defense.Disney, nephew of famed animator Walt Disney, has made his buyoutoffer conditional on dismantling of the plan.   Polaroid had refused a Shamrock request for a list of names andaddresses of employees in the plan.   That legal wrangle is separate from a suit by Polaroid, also inDelaware Chancery Court, seeking an order blocking Shamrock's$42-a-share tender offer for Polaroid stock. Trial of that suit isset to begin Thursday.   In another development Tuesday, Shamrock extended the deadlinefor acceptance of its tender offer from Monday to Nov. 17, and saidabout 6.8 percent of Polaroid stockholders had offered to sell theirshares as of Monday.   A parallel offer from Shamrock offers $44 a share if Polaroidmanagement negotiates a friendly takeover.</TEXT></DOC>
