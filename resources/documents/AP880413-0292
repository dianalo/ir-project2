The savings rate dropped to historic lows. Unemployment reacheddouble-digit levels. Housing prices soared five times. Borrowingand interest rates hit record highs. Odd things kept happeningthroughout the economy.   Seeking explanations, some economic theorists came up withequally odd theories, the most popular of them being that thenation had lost its work ethic and common sense and was on arelentless course downward.   Now comes evidence that maybe what happened to produce theseevents, or to exacerbate them, was a factor so obvious it wasn'tduly considered _ an unlikely possibility until you take intoaccount the imperfections of human perception.   That unlikely cause was the baby boom of 1946 to 1964.   Edward Yardeni, an economist for Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., contends that the boom not only caused some of those extremereadings but is likely to produce a few extremes, mainly positive,for the future as well.   ``The baby boomers have had a tremendous influence on oureconomy,'' says Yardeni, 38 years old and therefore a boomerhimself.   ``Undoubtedly they will continue to be extraordinarilyinfluential. Yet most models of the economy completely ignoredemographic trends,'' he said.   Background:   During the 19 years between 1946 and 1964, more than 76 millionbabies were born in the United States, almost one-third of ourpresent population. This, of course, produced a population bulgethat, as it moved through the years, produced economic change.   In the 1970s inflation roared and unemployment soared as babyboomers overwhelmed the job market.   ``They entered the labor force faster than the economy couldcreate jobs,'' says Yardeni, observing that the labor force rose11.3 percent in the 1950s and 18 percent in the 1960s _ comparedwith 30 percent in the 1970s.   As the jobless rate rose, policymakers responded by stimulatingthe economy in an effort to create more jobs for the boomers.Politicians knew also that the boomers were entering anothermarketplace, the political arena.   So, Yardeni notes, economic policy became biased towardsinflation.   ``Inflation didn't bother the baby boomers. They could beatinflation by getting married and bringing home two paychecks. Thosetwo paychecks, in turn, gave them the purchasing power to fuel evenmore inflation.''   They needed a place to live, so they leveraged their paycheckswith large mortgages for condominiums and houses, forcing housingprices to rise even faster than the general level of inflation.Interest rates rose, too.   They needed items to fill those houses, so they consumedeagerly. They needed furniture and appliances and cars, and thatdidn't leave much money to save, especially since they were stillwell below their peak earning years.   Now, as the demographic bulge moves on, the baby boomers aregrowing older and leaving behind the habits of the young.Increasingly, the high-spending Yuppies are shifting to theconservative, savings-minded ``couch potato'' stage.   So, says Yardeni, we can expect this within the next five years:   _The savings rate will rise from the current 5.4 percent to 10percent, a rate previously not reached in peacetime for anysustained period of time.   _The jobless rate will fall to 4 percent from March's level of5.6 percent.   _Increases in consumer spending should slow markedly.   _Home prices should rise at a much slower pace.   _Productivity should grow rapidly because the boomers will havepeak skills. This same factor should help keep the inflation ratelow.   While other factors contributed to the extremes of the past twodecades, it is difficult to argue that Yardeni's demographicsdidn't play a very large role _ a role so big it seems incredibleit wasn't given proper attention.   The message now is a pleasant one: The baby boomer bulge thatgave the economy indigestion for two decades is now spelling relief.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday April 13</NOTE></DOC>
