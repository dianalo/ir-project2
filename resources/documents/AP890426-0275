(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc., the world's leadingmaker of contact lenses, has decided that it's not a good idea towear extended-wear soft contact lenses continuously for more than aweek without removing and cleaning them.   Wednesday's announcement may be the first indication that theend is near for the soft contact lens that can be worn for longperiods of time.   ``I think you'll see the FDA come out with a similar policy verysoon,'' said Dr. Michael Lemp, professor and chairman of the Centerfor Sight at Georgetown Medical School in Washington.   Extended-wear lenses, first introduced in 1984, are currentlyapproved by the Federal Drug Administration for continuous wear ofup to 30 days. There are about 4.6 million Americans who wearextended-wear lenses.   Lemp said a recent, as yet unpublished, study conducted at theMassachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, has indicated thatthe longer lenses are worn continuously, the greater the risk tothe eyeball's outer coating, the cornea.   ``My own impression, is that people have been shying away fromextended-wear lenses for a long time because of safety concerns,''Lemp said Wednesday. ``This announcement says that seven days is anacceptable time period.''   A spokeswoman at the FDA in Rockville, Md., said the agency wasreviewing its policy about extended-wear lenses and would probablyissue a statement next week.   But Carol Herman, a spokeswoman in an FDA office that isconcerned with the safe use of medical devices, said the agency isdrafting a letter urging the nation's eight major contact lensmakers to voluntarily change their labels and packaging to reflecta seven-day, instead of a 30-day, maximum.   The question of the safety of extended-wear lenses has beenhotly debated in the eye care industry for the past five years.   ``Our review of the research tells us that ... the risk ofcomplication increases at longer-wearing periods,'' said HalJohnson, president of the professional products division at Bauschandamp; Lomb.   The company sent a telegram to 30,000 ophthalmologists andoptometrists around the country Monday recommending thatextended-wear lenses only be prescribed for seven days' continuoususe, rather than 30 days.   ``We believe that successful wear is most easily achieved withinthe seven-day window. We're saying at or before seven days, thelenses should be removed, cleaned and disinfected,'' said Johnson.   The much-talked about Boston study, which examined bothdaily-wear and extended-wear soft contact lenses, has beencompleted, but is being examined by statisticians to ensureaccuracy, said Regina Kilfoyle, a spokesman the Eye and EarInfirmary, a hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School.   Results from the study have been made available to contact lensmakers and some eye doctors, but they have not been published andare still being confirmed, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
