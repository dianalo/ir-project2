Since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesended its meeting on Feb. 15, the price of crude oil hasdeclined by about $1 a barrel. Traders who had anticipateddeeper output cuts by the group of ministers than thoseannounced were disappointed. But telexes to customersassuring such cutbacks by OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and someother of the group's members stanched a major sell-offfollowing the meeting. Now traders are waiting to see if thepromised cuts really materialize.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The market is going through a post-OPEC lull,&quot; saidAndrew Lebow, an analyst for E.D.andamp; F. Man International inNew York.   Crude oil for April delivery ended trading at $18.46 abarrel, down 2 cents. Heating oil contracts for Marchfinished at 50.87 cents a gallon, down 0.48 cents. Gasolinecontracts for March, however, rose by 0.88 cents to 54.57cents a gallon.   The only news report of note in the market yesterday wasthe weekly statistics analysis released late Tuesday by theAmerican Petroleum Institute, which showed a rise incrude-oil inventories. That increase, coupled with a jump inrefinery throughput, was perceived as bearish by traders.   But an unanticipated decline in gasoline inventorieshelped prop up oil prices across the board. Gasoline stockshad been expected to grow. &quot;Gasoline saved the market,&quot; saidNauman Barakat, vice president of energy futures trading forMerrill Lynch. &quot;And in anticipation of driving season, it mayjust be a case of as gasoline goes so goes the market, atleast for awhile.&quot;   According to the Institute, crude stocks last week rose by1.35 million barrels to 334.18 million barrels. Heating oilstocks fell by 3.38 million barrels, marking only half thepace of inventory drawdowns set during the past few weeks.Gasoline supplies slipped by 365,000 barrels to 230.78million barrels.   In the absence of other news, market participants arelikely to await the first news of OPEC production during thesecond half of February. Those numbers could give someindication of how serious the group really is about reducingproduction. However, because much of February's business wasaccounted for prior to the OPEC gathering, output duringearly March might provide a more accurate picture of pumpinglevels.   But market participants are anxiously awaiting signs thatmajor OPEC producers Iran and Nigeria are going to reduceoutput to customers. So far, Iran has indicated that it willreduce its spot sales of crude oil. But, traders point out,most of that producer's crude has been sold via contractrather than on a basis of individual spot sales.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat futures contractsrebounded from a dip early in the session amid reports thatgrain importing officials from the Commonwealth ofIndependent States are slated to arrive in the U.S. nextweek. Grain traders said they expect talks with U.S.officials to concern how the Agriculture Department mightbegin to award food-buying loan guarantees directly toindividual republics instead of through a commonwealthorganization. Soybean prices dipped amid increasing prospectsfor a large harvest in South America, which is a majorcompetitor of the U.S. in the world market. Corn pricessettled mixed.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rallied. Copper for Februarydelivery ended at $1.031 a pound, up 1.1 cents; the activelytraded May contract rose 1.35 cents to $1.029. Mark Jevons,senior vice president of Sharps Pixley in New York, saidshort-covering in London was followed by very heavy fund andcommission house buying in the U.S. Traders cover shortpositions, or bets that the price will fall, by buyingoffsetting contracts. The rally ran into some resistance at$1.03 on profit-taking and some producer selling, Mr. Jevonssaid, but he added that producers for the most part arestaying on the sidelines. Stephen Platt, vice president ofDean Witter in Chicago, attributed the strength to continuednervousness about labor disruptions in Chile and Peru. Headded that yesterday's durable goods report for January,which was up 1.5% from December, also helped copper prices.He predicted prices won't rise through the strong resistancebetween $1.03 and $1.05.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices fell on selling based on technicalfactors. Sugar for March delivery lost 0.29 cent a pound tofinish at 7.87 cents. The actively traded May contract ended0.2 cent lower at 7.95 cents. Prices came under pressure bydisappointed traders who had expected to see indications ofbetter demand, particularly from Russia, before theexpiration of the March contract, said Dean Witter's Mr.Platt. As the price fell below 8 cents, previously enteredsell orders were executed, pushing prices down further,traders said. Prices are likely to remain weak until theMarch contract expires on Friday, said Scott Servetah,analyst at Cargill Investor Services.</TEXT></DOC>
