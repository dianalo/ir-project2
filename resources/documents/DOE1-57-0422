<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0422 </DOCNO><TEXT>The principal factor that makes the Wishbone Hill district a unique Alaskancoal deposit is that essentially all required infrastructure is alreadyestablished. The hard-surfaced Glenn Highway passes about 1 to 3 milessouth of the district. Palmer and the lower Matanuska Valley is servedby a 7-mile long branch of the Alaska Railroad. Export coal could betransported by the Alaska Railroad from Palmer to the Port of Seward,a distance of approximately 155 rail miles. An evaluation of past geologicinformation, coupled with new drilling and field mapping, has led tothe location of two surface-mineable coal blocks. Although not completelydefined, these two blocks contain an estimated 20 million tons of surface-mineablecoal. As a result of a east-west stratigraphic variation in the coal-bearingsection, there is a significant difference in run-of-mine coal qualitybetween the two blocks. A consistent, very high-quality product can beproduced from either block if the coal is washed. The coal from bothblocks can be mined using a truck/shovel direct overburden haulback system.Because of the coal quality differences between the two potential mineblocks, there is unusual flexibility for the marketplace, both in Alaskaand abroad. 17 references.</TEXT></DOC>
