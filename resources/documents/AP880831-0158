A 25-year-old woman occupying Tooth Cave was arrested fortrespassing Tuesday afternoon, said Travis County sheriff'sdeputies. Formal charges were pending.   Members of the group Earth First! on Monday occupied three cavesin northwestern Travis County, near the site of a planned shoppingcenter. Activists continued to occupy Amber and Kretschmarr caveson Wednesday, a spokeswoman said.   James Reddell, a University of Texas scientist who discoveredthe three caves 25 years ago, said he agreed with the environmentalgroup that they are priceless biologically. But he called theirprotest ``absurd, counterproductive'' and said it could threatenthe very organisms the activists are trying to save.   ``Those caves are small, and any time you have someone insideyou change the temperature,'' he said. The protesters ``have gonecompletely overboard,'' he said.   But Earth First! coordinator Barbara Dugelby defended theprotest and said it came after months of effort to work throughnormal channels.   ``People say we're intruding on these caves,'' she said. ``Wethink construction and destruction are intruding on these caves.''   The group claimed the landowner, Dr. Fred Purcell, risked damageto the caves by allowing sewer lines, detention ponds and roadwaysto be built on the land.   However, Purcell denied the charges, saying he is working withcity officials and researchers to keep the caves intact.   Tooth Cave has five species of invertebrates found nowhere elseon Earth, said Reddell, who has written about 100 articles on caveenvironments. But he said Purcell has been ``totally cooperative''with explorers and with University of Texas researchers.   Dugelby said the environmentalists want the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service to place the five species _ two beetles, a spider,a pseudoscorpion and a ``cave-adapted daddy longlegs'' _ on itslist of endangered species.</TEXT></DOC>
