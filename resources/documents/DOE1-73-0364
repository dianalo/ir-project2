Technical feasibility is proved in many cases.Efficiency has generally improved and the costs were lowered by a factorof 2 to 3. Nevertheless, commercialization on a broad basis has failedto be realized to date, and the question, whether the renewable energysources will render an important contribution to the electricity supplyin Switzerland or not, is still unanswered. So far the fundamental disadvantagesof these energy carriers cannot be overcome. Energy yield related tomaterial input remains low, the area requirements are large and the resultingenergy output is usually determined by meteorological and physical factorsthat cannot be influenced. 1 ref., 10 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
