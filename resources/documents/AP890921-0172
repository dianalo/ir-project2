Though nominally independent, the farmer's union has battledalongside Solidarity for eight years and backs its new parliamentarycoalition. Its initiative to form its own party could augur thebreakup of Solidarity into more narrowly defined parties.   However, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk a varietyof parties in Poland was inevitable and that he was not disturbed.Hesaid the proposal ``should be treated naturally.''   In his statement, Rural Soldarity Chairman Jozef Slisz said thenew party should be called Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity.   ``It is only the Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity that canabolish monopolies. I believe that (this party) will help build acivil society,'' he said in the statement printed in thepro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.   The new party would rival the existing United Peasants Party,which Rural Solidarity criticizes for its long alliance with theCommunist Party and its support of collectivation of private farmsin the 1950s.   The United Peasants Party switched allegiance last month toSolidarity, creating the parliamentary bloc that allowed Solidarityactivist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to take over as prime minister on Aug.24. His government is the first East Bloc admiministration led by anon-Communist since the Communists consolidated control of EasternEurope after World War II.   Rural Solidarity members have been unhappy with their role in thenew government. The farmers' union received only one post ofminister without portfolio in the 24-member Cabinet, despite itslong alliance with Solidarity.   Slisz's statement implied criticism of how the new government wasformed. He said the countryside viewed ``with astonishment'' recentparliament reshuffles.   ``In this situation, after due consideration, I came to theconclusion that it is necessary to establish our own politicalorganization,'' he said.   He said that the United Peasants Party was not equal to theproblems facing Poland.   ``Agriculture needs immediate changes. However, it is to deludeoneself dangerously to believe that these changes can be effected bythe renovated United Peasants Party: a Stalinist product establishedby the (Communist Party) to fight against private farming,'' saidSlisz.   ``The people who earlier acted against the interests of thecountryside will not cure its ills now,'' he said.   United Peasant Party chairman Dominik Ludwiczak issued astatement read on state television Thursday night saying ``mutualcomplaints and conflicts do not serve effective action.'' He added,``One cannot blame currently active members of the party formistakes of 40 years ago.''   He suggested instead that farm leaders of all stripes holdmeetings to work out their differences.   Earlier Thursday, Slisz told leading Solidarity parliamentdeputies and senators about the plans for the new party, the statePAP news agency reported.   In response to fears that the caucus would break up intofactions, Slisz promised that deputies or senators who join the newparty will continue to operate as members of the Solidarity caucus.</TEXT></DOC>
