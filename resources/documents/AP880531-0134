Dead fish were found in three locations along the coast ofDenmark since the algae spread from the southern coasts of Norwayand Sweden last week, Toerring said in a statement. Tests werebeing conducted to determine whether the fish were killed by thealgae, which suffocates fish by clogging their gills.   ``There is nothing to indicate that the growth of algae hasculminated,'' said Henrik Sandbech, deputy director of the stateEnvironment Agency.   The agency's emergency staff is worried that the algae couldspread even further along the coast later this week, when winds areforecast to shift.   Experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers andphosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramaticgrowth of the single-cell plants.   Carpets of algae up to 10 feet thick have been found about 33feet under the surface of the water.   Resort owners along the west coast of Denmark's JutlandPeninsula fear news of the algae might ruin the lucrative touristtrade this summer.   ``If the algae plague gets worse in the next 14 days, we risk anose dive in the number of West German tourists,'' said KurtLarsen, head of tourism in west Jutland.   Tourism is a $2.3 billion business in Denmark, and about 10percent of that amount comes from Jutland.   In Norway, fish farmers were advised by marine biologists tokill their fish. As a result, the farmers have lost salmon, seatrout and other domestically grown fish worth $38.5 million.   Some fish, particularly herring and flounder that swim at thebottom of the sea, have not been as hard hit as fish cultivated inpens. Some major fish farms in western Norway began towing theirpens away from coastal areas into Norway's deep, cool fiords toavoid the algae threat.   Danish authorities have dispatched two marine environmentresearch vessels to the Skagerrak Strait between Denmark and Norwayand the Kattegat belt between Denmark and Sweden to monitor thegrowth and movement of the algae.   Swedish Environment Minister Birgitta Dahl called for a specialsession of the Nordic Council _ an association of Icelandic,Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Finnish parliamentarians _ to dealwith the algae threat in the Baltic and North seas.</TEXT></DOC>
