Col. Enrique Bermudez, 56, a former colonel in the latePresident Anastasio Somoza's army, was elected by a 44-2 voteMonday night to the seven-member directorate that oversees theU.S.-backed insurgency against the leftist Sandinista government.   Late Tuesday, a small homemade bomb exploded outside the hotelwhere the Nicaraguan resistance met, police said. No one wasinjured in the blast, which occurred about nine hours after themeeting ended.   Police Maj. Bueno Jiminian said no one had claimedresponsibility for the bombing. Police would not speculate on whoset off the bomb.   Bermudez's position was further enhanced by the re-election ofhis closest ally on the directorate, Aristedes Sanchez, and ofAlfredo Cesar, who spoke strongly in favor of his candidacy.   Newly elected director Wilfredo Montalvan also was seen as aBermudez supporter, but the allegiances of Roberto Ferrey andWycliffe Diego were less clear. Ferrey replaces his sister,Azucena, who decided not to seek re-election, and Diego fills avacant seat representing Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast Indians andCreoles.   Bermudez won a second vacant seat.   Adolfo Calero, 56, who as the directorate's senior member hadbeen regarded as its political head, also was re-elected. He is arival of Bermudez.   At a news conference Tuesday, Calero dismissed suggestions thatthe colonel's election would lessen chances that the U.S. Congresswill resume military aid to the Contras.   ``We elected a directorate to manage the organization,'' Calerosaid. ``We didn't elect people to appeal for the aid.''   Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February. Butthe Sandinista government's recent crackdown on politicalopposition in Nicaragua has given the Contras new hope that theUnited States will resume the flow of weapons and ammunition.   In Juigalpa, Nicaragua on Tuesday, the ninth anniversary of theSandinistas in power, President Daniel Ortega said governmentleaders ``are socialists and there's socialism in Nicaragua since1979.''   Both Bermudez and Calero said Bermudez, a professional soldier,would confine himself to military matters, acting as aquasi-defense secretary on the previously all-civilian politicaldirectorate.   But Bermudez skirted questions about whether he would relinquishhis military command of the 17,000 rebel troops, saying only thatthe directorate had not yet considered the matter.   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who was ousted from the directorate byMontalvan, said he thought Bermudez was determined to take absolutecontrol of the resistance movement.   ``I don't think he has total control, but that his clearly hisintention,'' said Chamorro, a 36-year-old former Nicaraguanjournalist.   A Reagan administration official, who was at the conference asan observer, said Washington would not object to Bermudez' electionto the directorate, which sets overall policy for the resistancemovement.   ``It's not Enrique Bermudez as one man equals the directorate;the ultimate decisions rests with all seven directors,'' said theofficial on condition of anonymity.   The resistance movement has been split by feuding betweenBermudez supporters and dissidents, who accuse him of being tooclose to former backers of Somoza.   The Nicaraguan Resistance Assembly is composed of exilerepresentatives of political parties and labor, business and ethnicgroups in Nicaragua.   In April, Calero and Chamorro sided with dissidents who triedbut failed to strip Bermudez of his military command after he firedsix commanders in Honduras for mutiny.   Bermudez said he sought a position on the directorate to regroupand unify the movement and give a political voice to the rebelforces in the field. He denied having any ambition for control ofthe movement and insisted he would confine himself to militarymatters.   He said said he is willing to resume negotiations for peace ifthe Sandinistas live up to promises to institute democratic reformsin Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
