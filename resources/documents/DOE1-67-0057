<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0057 </DOCNO><TEXT>The experimental installation for studying the polarization effects inexclusive reactions of negative meson recharging in neutral finite statesdecaying to gamma-quanta is described. Scintillation counters of beammonitoring, threshold Cherenkov counters for determining the incidentparticle type, two coordinate hodoscopes, the system of control counters,two units of a neutron detector and the Cherenkov gamma spectrometerof total absorption are main elements of the installation. Gamma spectrometerdesign (GAMS-type) containing 800 counters of total absorption with leadradiators is considered in detail. The spectrometer energy scale in theenergy range from 10 to 40 GeV has nonlinearity less than 1%. Energyresolution for gamma-quanta with energy andless; 40 GeV equals approximately0.03. The spectrometer spatial resolution is 3 mm. A flowsheet of theinstallation electronic equipment, consisting of modules of nanosecondelectronics, amplitude converters, counters and storage registers, isgiven. All electronic units are made according to the SUMMA standard.HP-2100A computer is used in the experiment for data collection, it operateson-line with the installation and has a random access memory of 32 K16-word capacity. Asymmetry investigations are carried out at the installationin the recharging reactions of {pi}/sup -/p -andgt;({pi}/sup 0/, eta, eta',{omega}, f)+N type.</TEXT></DOC>
