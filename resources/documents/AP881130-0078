One recommendation is for a big increase in required fuelefficiency for automobiles.   The coalition of 30 environmental groups, organized as``Blueprint for the Environment,'' also called for raising theEnvironmental Protection Agency to full Cabinet status andincreasing its budget by about 20 percent. The fiscal 1989 budgetcontains about $l.5 billion for EPA operations.   In all, the coalition proposed increased spending of about $5.5billion for a variety of environment-benefiting programs, including$2 billion for mass transit.   The groups recommended $12.9 billion in tax increases, most ofthat from higher taxes on gasoline and other fuels. They askedspending cuts totaling $2.2 billion, including an end to what theysaid were subsidies to the nuclear power industry.   Thomas B. Stoel Jr., a staff attorney of the Natural ResourcesDefense Council who served as chairman of Blueprint for theEnvironment, said, ``Humanity's exploitation of the world's energyand other resources, global warming of the atmosphere, pollution ofthe air, water and land, and poisoning of the world's oceansthreaten to choke off worldwide economic progress. Indeed, theythreaten the physical viability of the planet itself.''   He said the United States was no longer the leader onenvironmental issues and that regaining that status ``will be thefirst and most important task for President-elect Bush.''   Many scientists believe that the globe faces a warming of 3 to 8degrees fahrenheit on average by the middle of the next century.   This warming is caused by the trapping of the earth's heat bygases emitted into the atmosphere by human activity, mostimportantly carbon dioxide from burning fuel. That trapping of heatis called the greenhouse effect.   Peter A.A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, saidthat to counter such a warming and to combat other air pollutionproblems such as acid rain, Bush should ``order that improved energyefficiency be the top priority of the Energy Department.''   Berle said setting such a priority would require increasingemphasis on renewable technologies such as solar systems and raisingthe fuel efficiency of U.S. automobiles to 45 miles per gallon fromthe current requirement of 26.5 mpg.   Stoel had breakfast with Bush this morning and presented asummary of the group's recommendations, which were contained in 16volumes being distributed to the Bush transition team for study anduse by various departments.   Bush has made environmental protection a theme of his campaign,calling for, among other things, new controls on the sources of acidrain if the government's current $5 billion, five-year ``cleancoal'' demonstration projects don't bring enough pollution reduction.   Other groups in the coalition include Defenders of Wildlife, theWilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the National WildlifeFederation, Friends of the Earth, and the Izaak Walton Club.</TEXT></DOC>
