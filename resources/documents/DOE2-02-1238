The constitution of axially heterogeneouscores of 1,000 MWe class was comparatively examined in order to optimizefrom the viewpoint of the size reduction of core systems, the extensionof fuel life and the improvement of safety. As the results of comparingthe selected main characteristics of the axially heterogeneous coreswith homogeneous cores, it was clarified that the former has the followingmerits. The power peaking factor is small, and the core volume can bereduced. The maximum quantity of fast neutron irradiation is small, andfuel life can be extended. Since the axial distribution of neutron fluxis flat, the insertion of reactivity due to the vertical movement ofcontrol rods is small, therefore, the allowable value for the verticalmevement of control rods at the time of earthquakes increases. The energyreleased at the time of a hypothetical core collapse accident decreases.In this study, emphasis was placed on the conceptual design of the coressuitable to the reduction of power generation cost utilizing the featuresof AHC concept, and the construction of internal blankets and the planof operating control rods were optimized.
