In two 5-4 votes, the Supreme Court said Monday theConstitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibitexecution of people who committed crimes as young as 16, or adultswith the reasoning capacity of children.   ``The imposition of death sentences on juvenile offenders was inclear contravention of international human rights treaties andstandards including the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights, bothof which the U.S. government signed in 1977 but has not ratified,''Amnesty International said.   The London-based group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977,said the death penalty was particularly inappropriate forindividuals who had not attained full physical or emotional maturityat the time of their crimes.   ``To impose the death penalty in such cases, whether asretribution or as an intended deterrent, violates basic principlesof humanity,'' the group's statement said.   Amnesty International noted that 72 countries that retain thedeath penalty have abolished it for criminals under the age of 18,including the Soviet Union, South Africa, Syria, Paraguay and Libya.   Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran are among the countries thathave executed people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes,Amnesty International said.</TEXT></DOC>
