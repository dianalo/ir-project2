Salvadoran Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, an observer at thetalks, said the the Farabundo Marti National Liberation front andthe government delegates could not agree on details for acease-fire. But he said they agreed to continue trying at a meetingNov. 20-21 in Caracas, Venezuela.   ``The two sides have agreed to continue negotiating an end tohostilities, with both undertaking to include all specific proposaleach sides presents in the agenda at the next round,'' he said.   Rosa Chavez said the only agreement reached at the three-daymeeting in the town of Moravia, just north of San Jose, was that amechanism should be set up to verify future accords are honored.   The talks, which began Monday with a two-day schedule, had beenextended to Wednesday. But Rosa Chavez said the two sides recessedthe talks after it became apparent there was no way out of thedeadlock.   Oscar Santamaria, who heads the government delegation, said theguerrillas had created an ``obstacle to advancement'' by expandingtheir proposal.   The rebels ``divert the discussion from the main theme to otherelements and that number of points make it impossible to go intothe theme of an end to hostilities,'' Santamaria said.   The guerrillas have proposed a cease-fire, a purge of the armedforces, respect for human rights and democratic freedoms to lay thegroundwork for their formation of a legal political party.   President Alfredo Cristiani's government has proposed animmediate end to fighting and disbanding of rebel forces as a firststep.   Salvador Samayoa, a rebel representative, accused the governmentof inflexibility in the talks.   ``Substantial agreements appear to be far away. The governmentis not prepared to negotiate,'' Samayoa said.   The first round of talks since Cristiani took office June 1 washeld in September in Mexico City.   About 70,000 people have been killed in the war, the majority ofthem civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
