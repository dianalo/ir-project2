The notes may cause controversy in congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair. According to an intelligence source, White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan in December told the Senate Intelligence Committee that such notes existed, but that he didn't know what they contained.    Asked by the committee whether the president could turn over the notes to help in an investigation, the source said, Mr. Regan indicated that they would be protected by executive privilege. The source said the exchange &quot;wasn't confrontational.&quot;    Another White House official said yesterday that the only way to keep the notes, if subpoenaed, would be to claim executive privilege. &quot;I don't anticipate anyone is going to subpoena those notes,&quot; said the official, who described them as &quot;private recollections.&quot; He added, &quot;We haven't had any requests for them.&quot;    The Washington Post yesterday reported the existence of such notes and said some members of the Senate select committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair might ask for those pertaining to the issue.    Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), vice chairman of the select committee, declined to comment on the matter yesterday. And the full committee apparently has yet to decide on how to proceed.    White House spokesman Donald Mathes said the White House doesn't plan to release the notes to any of the investigators. &quot;The White House does feel to release them would impinge on the privacy of the president and others,&quot; he said.    Mr. Mathes added: &quot;We feel confident that by the end of the investigations, there will be no significant unanswered questions that would warrant the release of the president's private papers.&quot;    Both President and Mrs. Reagan keep notes, in private diaries, for potential use in writing their memoirs, according to friends of the Reagans. </TEXT></DOC>
