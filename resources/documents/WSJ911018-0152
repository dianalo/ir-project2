MD-80 jetliner tobe assembled by Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corp. would havebeen the perfect occasion to announce a new co-productionarrangement between the U.S. aerospace giant and China'spremier aircraft factory.   Lion dancers cavorted around the gleaming new twinjetbound for Shenyang-based China Northern Airlines. Firecrackers popped, banners flapped, and gongs sounded in thepleasant afternoon breeze. Inside Shanghai Aviation's newhangar, top Chinese officials delivered numerous speeches,and McDonnell Douglas executives praised six years ofSino-U.S. industrial cooperation.</LP><TEXT>   But there was no announcement about the long-awaited&quot;Trunkliner&quot; contract, a hard-fought deal under whichShanghai Aviation and several other Chinese aerospacefactories would co-produce what had been expected to be 150MD-90 twinjets to meet at least part of China's burgeoningair-traffic needs into the next century.   Indeed, since McDonnell Douglas last April won the mandatefrom Beijing to enter final negotiations with the Ministry ofAeronautics and Astronautics Industry, internal Chinesepolitics have whittled the proposed venture to just 40airplanes to be assembled in Shanghai between 1994 and 2000.An additional 130 planes now under discussion would needreconfirmation in 1995 for fabrication in the next century.   Gareth C.C. Chang, president of McDonnell Douglas Pacificandamp; Asia Ltd. and the U.S. company's lead negotiator, said hehas received assurances that China will commit to theadditional airplanes, both to build and to buy, at a laterdate. &quot;The {Chinese} government can't commit to somethingthat goes beyond 2005,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;What wehave today is a much more pragmatic way of doing it.&quot;   Despite this new, conservative approach, the deal isn'tdone yet. A Chinese team is scheduled to fly on Oct. 21 toLong Beach, Calif., where McDonnell Douglas builds commercialaircraft, for still more talks. Mr. Chang said that theproject documentation so far amounts to 1,000 pages, and thatthe most difficult negotiating points -- price and payment --still lie ahead.   He said it is &quot;critical&quot; that a final agreement be reachedby year end. Otherwise, the Shanghai factory will run out ofwork by the end of 1993 and first deliveries of the new modelwon't be on track for 1996.   Yet things still could go wrong for McDonnell Douglas.Aside from the complexities of the negotiations, rumoredreorganizations of both the Aerospace Ministry and the CivilAviation Administration of China, which buys aircraft andoversees the country's nominally autonomous carriers, couldfoul up existing relationships. New trade tensions resultingfrom Washington's possible imposition of trade sanctions onChina also could sour the climate for such a deal. &quot;Theycould hold it up for political reasons,&quot; Mr. Chang said.   In the months since McDonnell Douglas apparently knockedrival Boeing Co. out of the running for what could be a $4.5billion airplane and engine order, tensions between theAerospace Ministry and CAAC have continued unabated. CAAC, abig Boeing customer, favored a plan whereby the Shanghaiplant would assemble Boeing 737s. According to aviationsources in Beijing and elsewhere, CAAC did its sums and foundthe proposed MD-90 to be more expensive to buy and to fly. Soit told the powerful State Planning Commission that itwouldn't buy any of the 158-seat planes without statesubsidies.   The Aerospace Ministry, whose goal is to build on a decadeof cooperation and technology transfer between McDonnellDouglas and Shanghai Aviation, favors the add-on order of upto 170 MD-90s. The ministry's China National Aero-TechnologyImport-Export Corp., or CATIC, the official party in thenegotiations, thus resolved to limit the accord, at leastinitially, to 40 airplanes, and to take responsibility forselling them in China.   &quot;We have no risk on the airplanes being sold,&quot; Mr. Changsaid. &quot;We'll get paid up front even if there's no client.&quot;   He dismissed the notion that it would be difficult forCATIC to peddle the 40 firmly agreed airplanes within China.With its heavy-duty landing gear, new engines and otherimprovements, the MD-90 would be perfect for China's regionalairlines, he said. &quot;Provincial cities are still served byRussian airplanes,&quot; Mr. Chang said. &quot;With the new {landing}gear, every single airline in China besides the major fourwill want it. . . . We'll have trouble meeting demand.&quot; TheShanghai-built MD-80s have only two customers, China Northernand Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines.   Complicating the demand side of the equation is a separateplan to have the Shanghai plant assemble yet another MD-80derivative, the proposed 105-seat MD-95. This scaled-downversion of the existing model is being shopped around byMcDonnell Douglas to several potential customers, the mostimportant being NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines.   Northwest has a fleet of 149 old DC-9s, the airplane uponwhich the MD-80 and the MD-90 families are based. The U.S.carrier's DC-9s won't meet new noise requirements that willgo into effect in the U.S. by the end of the decade. Theplanes must be equipped with new engines or scrapped.   The Minneapolis-based airline said it is studying thefeasibility of buying Chinese-built MD-95s as replacements.But a spokesman cautioned that the study is at a &quot;verytentative and early stage.&quot; If the MD-95 goes ahead, &quot;itcould be a good plane,&quot; he added. &quot;But there is a big if inthat sentence.&quot;   The Shanghai factory already has a contract to buildanother 10 MD-80s, work that should keep it busy through1993. CAAC has pledged to buy five of the aircraft, and theother five will be purchased by McDonnell Douglas and sold tocarriers in the West, probably in South America, Mr. Changsaid.   But it is vital to keep the production line going, giventhat China has invested some $50 million in new assemblyfacilities, sophisticated computerized milling machines andwork-force training. Thus McDonnell Douglas and CATIC arekeen to agree on a further 20 MD-80s to keep the plant busyuntil 1996, when production of the first 20 Trunkliner MD-90swould begin.   At that point, if further Trunkliner orders are agreed,the Shanghai plant and its components suppliers in Shenyang,Xian and Chengdu would have to gear up to produce at leasttwice the number of airplanes a year than the current rate ofeight, Mr. Chang said. And if the MD-95 is launched, &quot;we canoverlay that on existing programs,&quot; he said, although itwould be &quot;tight.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
