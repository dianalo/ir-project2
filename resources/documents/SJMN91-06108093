For most of us that means beans.;    But whohas the time to go through all that soaking and long, slow cooking? EnterKonriko Quick-Cook 8 Bean Soup. In 20 minutes or so you get a protein andfiber fix that's not bad. There's a nice pepper undertone that doesn't requireany additional seasoning. (The mix is made in New Iberia, La., where they knowfrom hot.) I'd bolster the flavor some with vegetable or chicken stock though.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THESE BEANS COOK QUICKLY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Tasting Notes  </MEMO><TEXT>     On the downside, some of the beans, split peas mainly, cook faster thansome of the others, creating a mushy texture. And there is no way a 4-ouncebox and three cups of water feeds four to six people, not in my house anyway.Quick-Cook 8 Bean Soup costs about $1.69 in most supermarkets.; (hbox);    Yousay your life is so hectic you can't even spare 20 minutes? How about five tomake Instant Black Beans from Fantastic Foods? The Novato company, which alsomakes Instant Refried Beans, combines precooked black beans that are dried andflaked with dehydrated onion, spices, soybean oil and garlic and puts it in a7-ounce package that costs about $1.55.;    Combine the mix with water andseasonings for an easy Caribbean black bean soup or use as is for one of theelements in a burrito filling. As a dip, the mix needs a little somethingextra. I added a half cup of spicy salsa and it worked fine. Chili powder andcumin also would be good choices. Instant Black Beans are available at naturaland health food stores such as Whole Foods Market in Palo Alto.; (hbox);    Ofcourse, once we solve the problem of lowering our cholesterol with more beans,we get another problem. And you know the refrain of that tune.;    Yes, thosemusical fruits can be embarrassing. But Beano, an enzyme made by Lactaid Inc.of Pleasantville, N.J., is designed to minimize flatulence by breaking downgas-producing sugars from beans as well as broccoli, cabbage and many otherfoods. Just add three to eight drops of Beano to the first bite of theoffending food. The only catch is that Beano doesn't work at temperaturesabove 130 degrees. So cooked foods have to be cooled first.;    I tried Beanoon three occasions and I didn't notice any significant reduction inflatulence, though admittedly it's hard to measure such things. Companyofficials told me that people with high fiber diets may have to add Beano toseveral different foods to get the full effect. Or, if one food in particularcauses a problem, a higher dose may be required.;    Beano is sold in.55-ounce bottles for about $8.55. Look for it at Pay Less and Walgreen DrugStores and at K mart stores.
