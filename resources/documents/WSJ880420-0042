The energy concern said its Triton Canada Resources Ltd. unit will add 25 billion to 30 billion cubic feet of natural gas to its proven net reserve base as a result of the discoveries. Triton said it will pump gas from 18 of the wells initially, increasing its deliverability about 25 million cubic feet of natural gas a day.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Triton closed at $17.875, unchanged.    Separately, Triton said Triton Canada signed a new contract with Syncrude Canada Ltd., a government-run energy concern, calling for Triton to provide as much as 20 million cubic feet of gas a day to Syncrude's heavy oil extraction plant. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. </TEXT></DOC>
