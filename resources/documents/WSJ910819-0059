Patents issued to individuals in the U.S. rose 37% in thepast five years, to 18,300 in 1990 from 13,000 in 1986. AlanTratner, executive director of Inventors WorkshopInternational in Camarillo, Calif., says his appearance on&quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; last year triggered more than 10,000calls and letters to his club. &quot;We've seen a real surge ininterest in inventing,&quot; Mr. Tratner says.   One reason: Help for inventors is proliferating, enhancingthe odds for success. Inventing the better mousetrap remainsa lonely endeavor, likely to end in failure. But before, evenwhen would-be Edisons made their gadgets work, few knew howto market them.   Now, inventors are getting guidance as never before. Thenumber of major nonprofit inventors clubs has increasedfivefold to 150 in four years, estimates Roberta Toole,president of United Inventors Association of the U.S.A., anumbrella group based in St. Louis.   &quot;Not so long ago, inventors had to slog through everystep. Today, inventors groups will lead them,&quot; says Ms.Toole. &quot;Just about every state's economic-development agencyis working with inventors now.&quot; The Department of Energy evenstarted a free newsletter three years ago expressly to helpinventors clubs.   The clubs give moral support and tips on everything fromgetting a patent to negotiating a licensing agreement. Theycan also help find someone to evaluate an idea.&quot;You have tobe willing to tell the inventor he has an ugly baby,&quot; saysClayton Williamson, head of the Kansas Association ofInventors. Mr. Williamson is playing an active role in theinvention boom, building his club's membership to 800 from 17in four years.   A growing number of universities are offering to evaluateinventors' creations, generally for fees of around $150. TheUniversity of Wisconsin's Innovation Service Center findsmarket potential in only one of every eight ideas it sees,says Debra Knox-Malewicki, the program's manager. Successfulitems include a plastic tube that fits over crayons toprevent breakage and a new design for a shoe sole.   Despite such assistance, would-be inventors face manypitfalls. For every legitimate evaluation service, criticssay, there's a for-profit &quot;marketing firm&quot; that chargesthousands of dollars for nearly worthless reports andmailings. Even inventors with useful ideas can findthemselves butting their heads against the walls ofcorporations that shun outsiders for legal or internalreasons. And companies willing to consider an independent'sinvention usually want to see a workable prototype -- andproducing that can be costly.   Despite all that, things are looking up for smallinventors. One bright spot in recent years has been thecourts. A separate federal patent court was created in 1982,and it has been receptive to claims of patent infringement.As a result, inventors have been winning more cases -- suchas a recent $10.2 million judgment against Ford Motor Co. ina dispute over a windshield-wiper design.   &quot;Big companies used to tell us, go ahead and sue,&quot; saysJames Fergason, an inventor in Menlo Park, Calif., who didpioneering work in the liquid-crystal-display technology thatis used in watches and calculators. &quot;We don't have to takethat anymore.&quot;   Government assistance has also helped. Inventors oftenstart small businesses to commercialize their ideas, andgovernment research money earmarked for small business hasmore than doubled in the past five years, to $446 million in1990 from $199 million in 1985. The Commerce Departmentspends about $5 million a year on individuals and smallcompanies with energy-saving ideas, and is planning a programto give technology-evaluation support to the states.   Luis Muga, a University of Florida chemist, says $500,000in federal grants have been crucial in helping him develophis idea for improving the focusing of spectrometers,laboratory instruments that analyze substances.   Private venture capital is tough to find, but somecompanies do focus on inventors, especially inhigh-technology areas. Medical Innovation Partners ofMinneapolis says it looks at two or three dozen ideas a monthin the health-care and medical-devices field. It recentlyjoined forces with a physician who has found ways to healchronic skin wounds.   Doing a better job getting inventions to the marketplacecould have a significant impact on the nation. Giant,job-producing technologies -- ranging from photocopying topersonal computers -- were either created or advanced byindividual inventors, says Herbert Wamsley, executivedirector of Intellectual Property Owners Inc., aWashington-based trade group.   Some don't make it quite that big but still fill niches.Curt Landi of Sunnyvale, Calif., invented a new method formaking honeycombs, lattice-like structures used in everythingfrom airplane wings to shoe soles. Since 1989, ReebokInternational Ltd. has been using his honeycombs in its shoesto help cushion shock.   Another inventor, Robert Parker of Alamo, Calif., whosepatents cover creations from a liquid-crystal digitalthermometer to a device for measuring how hard an egg is asit boils, licensed technology to Duracell International Inc.for the battery tester it puts on its packages.   And Mr. Fergason, the liquid-crystal-display inventor,joined forces with a company in Holland, Mich., in Decemberto produce a welding-helmet lens that switches back and forthbetween a very light and a very dark filter in 1/20,000th ofa second, shielding the welder's eyes and sharply increasinghis productivity.   Inventors in academia are getting help, too. In themid-1980s, the U.S. gave universities patent rights toinventions financed by federal research money. As a result,the number of patents granted to U.S. universities hassoared, jumping 50% in 1989 alone to 1,216, and royaltyrevenues have shot up.   University researchers are being turned intoinventor-entrepreneurs. Research Corporation TechnologiesInc. of Tucson, Ariz., commercializes inventions foruniversities, paying faculty researchers up to $3,000 todisclose ideas for possible marketing. Arlon Hunt, ascientist at the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory at theUniversity of California's Berkeley campus, has used hisfederally financed research on super-insulating materials tohelp form a company to commercialize the technology. &quot;Fifteenyears ago the government probably would have tried to jail mefor doing that,&quot; says Mr. Hunt, describing the change in theclimate.   Increasingly, forging a corporate partnership is alsopossible. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has started a program lookingfor inventions that can be sold at its stores. And GeraldUdell, a professor at Southwest Missouri State University andthe head of Innovation Institute, which evaluates inventors'ideas, says that &quot;companies that 10 years ago were totallyclosed to inventors are opening their doors.&quot;   That can only fan the hope that springs eternal for everyinventor. Jay Edward Jones, an engineer in Youngstown, Ohio,has held talks with Kmart Corp. about distributing his TimberTies, which hold together landscaping timbers. While amanufacturing problem has put his project on hold, Mr. Jonesboasts that the next office he decorates &quot;will be on ayacht.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
