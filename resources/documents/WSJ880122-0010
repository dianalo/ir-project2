Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co. turned up the pressure on Sterling Drug Inc., by raising its tender offer for the company to $81 a share, or $4.62 billion.    The move late Wednesday night marked the second time in three days that the Swiss drug giant has sweetened its bid for Sterling.    Traders said Hoffmann-La Roche appeared to be attempting a classic &quot;bear hug,&quot; rapidly raising the ante for Sterling in an effort to pressure it into accepting the bid while also scaring off potential friendly suitors. They noted that Hoffmann-La Roche has twice raised its offer for the maker of Bayer aspirin, without any formal rejection by Sterling of the subsequent bids. As previously reported, Hoffmann-La Roche on Monday raised its bid to $76 a share, after Sterling's board rejected the Swiss concern's initial $72-a-share offer.    &quot;It was easy to turn down $72, but it would be really tough to reject $81,&quot; said one trader, who nonetheless expects Sterling to reject the latest offer.    Sterling Drug shares rose $2.50 to close at $78.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Heavy volume of more than 2.2 million shares made it the third most active issue on the Big Board.    Sterling declined to comment on Hoffmann-La Roche's latest sweetened bid, which now is scheduled to expire Feb. 3 instead of Feb. 2. In rejecting the initial offer, Sterling had called it &quot;grossly inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders&quot; and said the company had entered into talks with other potential buyers.    Sterling hasn't identified any potential friendly suitors. But in speculation among Wall Street professionals, one name frequently mentioned is Johnson andamp; Johnson. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based healthcare products maker declined to comment.    Others mentioned as potential suitors have been Nestle S.A., Pfizer Inc. and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., a major Japanese drug concern that formed a Japanese joint venture with Sterling.    But some Wall Street traders and investment bankers said the chances of a U.S. company's rescuing Sterling diminish as Hoffmann-La Roche's offering price escalates. If a U.S. company were to buy Sterling, it would have to amortize Sterling's substantial goodwill on its income statements over 30 to 40 years, without being able to deduct it from its taxes. Goodwill is the difference between a company's book value and a higher purchase price. Foreign companies don't have to worry about this goodwill problem.    In its statement Monday rejecting Hoffmann-La Roche's initial bid, Sterling said it has explored &quot;alternative transactions.&quot; These, Wall Street sources said, include the sale of certain assets, a recapitalization, a complete or partial liquidation, and the sale of equity to a friendly buyer.    Sterling also said it intends to pursue vigorously a lawsuit that the company filed last week against Hoffmann-La Roche, seeking to block the bid. A hearing on that suit is scheduled for next Friday. Sterling could wait until the court ruling, but Wall Street traders said this could make it difficult to cut a potential deal with a friendly suitor between then and Feb. 3, when Hoffmann-La Roche's bid expires.    And some Wall Street traders said that despite some analysts' valuing Sterling between $83 and $93 a share, Sterling can't count on the offering price being bid up much further than the current level, because of a weak stock market. </TEXT></DOC>
