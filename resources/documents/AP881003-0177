That was spread among 70.3 million physician claims _ roughlyone-fourth of all submitted to Medicare in fiscal 1987 _ andaveraged $38.11 in extra charges per billing.   Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay 20 percent of theamount Medicare deems reasonable, and those co-payments amounted to$25.99 for each of the 70.3 million claims that also contained whatMedicare calls ``excess billing.''   Adding the average Medicare co-payment to the average excesscharge resulted in an average out-of-pocket expense of $64.11 foreach of the patient bills that exceeded the Medicare standard.   The excess-billing claims came from the 63 percent of thenation's doctors who have not agreed to abide by the fee schedulesset by Medicare.   The percentage of claims with excess charges ranged from 3percent in Massachusetts, where state law forbids excess billing,to 51 percent in Wyoming.   Although federal health officials and Congress have instituted aseries of programs designed to encourage doctors to follow theMedicare scale, there is no national rule requiring them to do so.   The percentage of physicians who voluntarily follow the Medicarefee schedule ranges from 73.5 percent in Alabama to 14.9 percent inIdaho.   Despite the state law keeping doctors from collecting excesscharges from their Medicare patients, only 45.9 percent ofMassachusetts doctors have voluntarily agreed to be listed onMedicare's roster of ``participating physicians'' who ``acceptassignment.''   A physician who ``accepts assignment'' charges only the fee thatMedicare deems reasonable and proper, considering his or her billfully paid after collecting 20 percent from the patient and 80percent from Medicare.   ``With physician net income 10 times that of the elderly, it'snot too much to ask that all doctors accept the rates Medicare setsfor reimbursement as full payment from all Medicare patients,''said Robert M. Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, aconsumer group that released the study.   ``That's why we support national legislation prohibiting excesscharges. Voluntary efforts on the federal and state levels have notworked well enough, even when they have included incentives.''   Citizen Action, which claims 1.7 million members, based itssurvey on records maintained by the Health Care and FinancingAdministration, the agency that manages Medicare. Fiscal 1987 wasthe last year for which full statistics are available. Fiscal 1988ended only last Friday and all the bills are not in for the mostrecent 12-month federal budget year.   The Citizen Action analysis showed that the doctors who treatMedicare patients received an average income of about $60,000 infiscal 1987 just from those patients. That included the 80 percentpaid by Medicare and the enrollee's 20 percent share of``reasonable charges.''   ``Doctors who are not participating physicians (those who canbill patients excess charges) receive, on average, an additional$7,400 per year in excess charges to seniors,'' the study said.</TEXT></DOC>
