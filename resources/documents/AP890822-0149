Manuel AntonioNoriega, will be closed next week until democracy is restored toPanama, it was announced Tuesday.   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has used the embassy as ananti-Noriega headquarters for the past 18 months, made thedisclosure in a telephone interview on the eve of an Organization ofAmerican States foreign ministers meeting on Panama.   Sosa was appointed ambassador to Washington by then-PresidentEric Arturo Delvalle two years ago. Delvalle was deposed byNoriega's allies in February 1988 but the United States continues toregard him as the legitimate authority in Panama.   It also has continued to recognize Sosa as Panama's officialenvoy.   Sosa said he has decided to close the embassy on Aug. 31 becauseSept. 1 is the date on which Delvalle's term was scheduled to expire.   ``We have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutionalprinciple,'' Sosa said, adding he and his family are vacating theembassy and will move to an apartment in Washington. He intends tocontinue his struggle against Noriega, he said.   Sosa said State Department officials have informed him theyconcur with his decision to close the embassy.   Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma attempted to replace Sosalast year but the envoy, with U.S. goverment support, refused torelinquish control of the embassy.   Sosa has had partial access to Panamanian government funds in theUnited States which were frozen by the Reagan administration toprevent Noriega from having access to them. Sosa has used the fundsto keep the embassy functioning.   Sosa said he held little hope that an OAS mediating team set upthree months ago will be able to fulfill its mandate of achieving ademocratic transfer of power in Panama.   The crisis arose in Panama last May when, amid widespreadallegations of fraud, Panamanian authorities threw out the resultsof the country's national elections. Independent observers said theanti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo Endara, appeared to have won by alarge margin.   The OAS mediators were due to return to Washington Tuesday nightand will present their report to the OAS foreign ministers onWednesday.   U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said it appearlikely Noriega will arrange for Solis Palma, a Noriega loyalist, tobe replaced by an equally reliable successor on Sept. 1. Noriegawould retain behind-the-scenes control of Panama's political life.   This would fall short of the Bush administration's objectives forPanama.   ``We've supported the OAS mission,'' State Department deputyspokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday.   ``We've supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer ofpower. We've stated very clearly that for that to occur Noriega mustgo. We've stated very clearly our policy that there will be noaccommodation with the Noriega regime,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
