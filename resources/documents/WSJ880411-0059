Mr. Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer of Reebok International Ltd., again was one of the highest-paid executives in the U.S. last year, receiving compensation of $15.4 million, up 17.6% from $13.1 million in 1986.    Mr. Fireman, who tentatively agreed recently to buy a majority stake in the National Football League franchise, received a salary from Reebok of just $357,200 in 1987. But he received a bonus of $15,066,700 under an employment agreement that provides him a bonus equal to 5% of the company's pretax earnings that exceed $20 million. The footwear and apparel company had pretax income of $306.1 million last year. Its net income was $165.2 million, up 25% from 1986, on sales that rose 51% to $1.39 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
