The patient was a 63-year-old woman who complained of gaitand memory disturbances. On admission neurological examination revealedrecent memory disturbance, left deafness, left XI, XIIth cranial nervepalsies, and slight ataxic gait. Roentgenogram of the skull showed anenlarged left jugular foramen with bone erosion. Plain X-ray computerizedtomography scan (X-CT) indicated obstructive hydrocephalus and X-CT withcontrast enhancement revealed a mass lesion in the left posterior cranialfossa extending through enlarged left jugular foramen to the extracranialspace toward the level of C/sub 2/. Cerebral angiography demonstrateda large mass with blood supply from branches of left external carotidand vertebral arteries. The tumor stain was not remarkable. Left internaljugular vein was completely obstructed at the level of the second cervicalvertebral body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) clearly showed the tumorextending from the anterolateral portion to the second cervical vertebralbody through the enlarged jugular foramen to the posterior cranial fossa.Brain stem and cerebellar hemisphere which were markedly compressed bythe mass were clearly visualized. At first a ventriculo-peritoneal shuntwas made and four weeks later subtotal removal of the tumor was undertaken.Histopathology of tumor specimen showed typical glomus jugulare tumor.MRI was considered to be very useful for the diagnosis and treatmentof the glomus jugulare tumor with intra- and extracranial extension.</TEXT></DOC>
