The justices ruled, 6-3, that the store owner in aNewington, Conn., shopping plaza didn't violate federal laborlaw by barring union organizers who weren't store employeesfrom distributing handbills in the plaza's parking lot.</LP><TEXT>   A number of national business associations had urged thejustices in friend-of-the-court briefs to curtail whatemployers consider the increasingly aggressive tactics thatsome unions have used in recruitment campaigns. Unions, manyof which have shrunk in recent years, contend that they havemerely responded to difficult circumstances, such ascommunicating with widely dispersed work forces.   Yesterday's case arose from a 1987 effort by the UnitedFood and Commercial Workers union to organize the workers atLechmere Inc.'s variety retail store in Newington. Thestore's management prevented the union from distributinghandbills in an adjacent parking lot jointly owned byLechmere and a developer but generally open to the public.The union filed a complaint with the National Labor RelationsBoard, which ruled that Lechmere had violated federal laborlaw by denying workers the right to organize. A federalappeals court in Boston affirmed the NLRB ruling, andLechmere appealed to the Supreme Court.   In an opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the highcourt reversed the appeals court decision. Justice Thomassaid that as a general rule, an employer can't be forced toallow nonemployee organizers onto its property. The justicesrejected a method of analysis the NLRB has used since 1988 tobalance employee rights to organize against employer propertyrights.   The Bush administration had filed a brief supporting theNLRB's ruling and opposing Lechmere.   Justice Thomas, however, wrote that nonemployee organizersmay enter company property only in the rare case whereemployees are so inaccessible that &quot;reasonable attempts&quot; toreach them &quot;through the usual channels&quot; aren't available tounion recruiters. He suggested that one such case would be ifemployees lived on company property closed to the public. Thehigh court said that the organizers in this case faced no&quot;unique obstacles&quot; that prevented their access to Lechmereemployees.   Justice Byron White wrote a dissenting opinion, joined byJustice Harry Blackmun; Justice John Stevens wrote a separatedissent opinion.

The justices said they will review an Alabama SupremeCourt decision upholding that state's efforts to limit theimporting of hazardous waste. Chemical Waste Management Inc.of Oak Brook, Ill., filed a lawsuit to challenge the fees.The firm contended that Alabama violated the constitutionalprotection of interstate commerce by imposing a tax thatapplies only to out-of-state waste.   The case has broad implications for the waste-treatmentindustry. Chemical Waste Management operates the country'slargest hazardous waste disposal facility in Emelle, Ala.,where the company receives hundreds of thousands of tons ofwaste annually, most of it from other states.   Moreover, trade groups representing many industries arguedin a brief supporting Chemical Waste Management that, if theAlabama Supreme Court decision is allowed to stand, &quot;otherstates almost certainly will follow Alabama's lead and imposesimilar restrictions.&quot; Such regulation would lead to severe&quot;economic disruption,&quot; the manufacturers' groups warned.   Alabama officials asserted that efforts by a number ofstates to exclude waste from elsewhere present politicalproblems requiring congressional legislation. But in themeantime, the Alabama officials argued that they have &quot;alegitimate interest in guarding against the various health,safety and environmental risks posed by the transportationand landfilling of enormous quantities of inherentlydangerous hazardous wastes.&quot;   Chemical Waste Management filed suit to try to eliminateseveral obstacles to importing waste into Alabama. The U.S.Supreme Court agreed to consider only one provision: a$72-a-ton levy imposed on waste coming from out of state. TheAlabama Supreme Court ruled that the tax, as well as otherrestrictive measures, serve &quot;legitimate local purposes&quot; andaren't aimed at discriminating against out-of-state business.(Chemical Waste Management Inc. vs. Hunt)   ---   Dial-a-Porn                                                                                                          The justices effectively cleared the way for enforcementof a federal law designed to restrict children's access todial-a-porn telephone message services. The Supreme Court'srefusal to review a lower-court ruling upholding the lawcould make it difficult for companies to make a profit byselling sexually explict telephone services.   The federal appeals court in New York upheld asconstitutional a 1989 law requiring that individuals filewritten requests with the telephone company if they want toreceive access to sexually explicit message services. Theprimary aim of the law is to prevent minors from hearing&quot;indecent&quot; material. But purveyors of dial-a-porn contendthat the cumbersome process of collecting written requestsfrom customers may drive them out of business.   The law hadn't been enforced, pending resolution of thecase before the Supreme Court.   Congress passed the 1989 law in response to a SupremeCourt decision that year that struck down a tougher versionof the anti-pornography statute. The earlier versioncategorically banned &quot;indecent&quot; telephone message services --a prohibition that the high court said wasn't &quot;narrowlytailored&quot; to the purpose of preventing children from beingexposed to sexually explicit material. The First Amendmentgenerally requires that restrictions on speech serve a&quot;compelling interest&quot; in a narrowly tailored fashion.   The revised law imposes the written-request requirement ona phone company if it serves as an intermediary by issuingbills to its customers for sexually explicit messages. Thelaw doesn't appear to apply if dial-a-porn services billcustomers directly.   Commercial dial-a-porn providers sued to challenge theconstitutionality of the revised law, and a federal trialcourt blocked its enforcement. The trial court ruled thatprotecting children from indecent phone messages is acompelling government interest but that the written-requestapproach isn't the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; of advancing thegoal. The trial court suggested using the less restrictiveapproach of putting the burden on parents to request that thetelephone company block access to dial-a-porn services fromtheir homes.   The federal appeals court in July reversed that decision,concluding that the written-request procedure &quot;is morelikely&quot; to prevent children's access to dial-a-porn and thatit doesn't violate the constitutional protection of freespeech. The Supreme Court declined to review the appealscourt decision.

Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island haveaccused New Hampshire of imposing a property tax onSeabrook's owners that would ultimately result in addingmillions of dollars to the electric bills of consumers in thethree challenging states, but not to those of New Hampshireresidents. (Connecticut vs. New Hampshire)   -- Declined to review a dispute over whether certainwidely issued corporate liability insurance policies covercompanies for causing environmental pollution.
