No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Iranian daily said today that holdingWestern hostages can be used as a way to prevent foreignintervention in Lebanon, according to Iran's official IslamicRepublic News Agency.   The report came a day after a pro-Iranian group holding JosephCicippio and another American threatened to kill the hostages if theFrench navy intervenes in Lebanon.   ``To prevent foreign intervention, a lever in the hands ofLebanon's Moslem combatants was the susceptibility of Westerngovernments vis-a-vis the hostage issue,'' the Abrar newspaper saidin an editorial.   The pro-government daily assured the Lebanese Moslems that their``struggle'' would culminate in the establishment of a state basedon ``their will as the country's majority,'' according to IRNA,monitored in Nicosia.   The pro-Iranian kidnappers of 16 Western hostages held in Lebanonare Shiite Moslems _ Lebanon's largest single sect _ seeking tocreate an Iranian-style Islamic republic to replace theChristian-dominated system.   Iran has denied it has any direct control over the fate of thehostages.   Urging the West against involvement in Lebanon's politics, Abrarreferred to the 1983 attacks by Shiite zealots against the Frenchand American military units in Beirut, which killed nearly 300troops and led to the withdrawal of the multinational peacekeepingforce from Lebanon a few months later.   IRNA said the Iranian newspaper described the withdrawal of thepeacekeepers from Lebanon as the ``escape of the American and Frenchforces.''   On Sunday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened tokill Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy if there is intervention byFrance, which dispatched two warships to the eastern Mediterraneanreportedly to evacuate 7,000 French nationals from war-batteredLebanon if the need arises.   ``America, which is spurring France, should realize that anyfoolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of itshostages to danger,'' the Shiite Moslem group said in a statement.   The handwritten message in Arabic, delivered to the independentnewspaper An-Nahar and a Western news agency in Beirut, wasaccompanied by a photocopy of a photograph of Tracy the groupreleased Aug. 1.   The group recently threatened to kill Cicippio unless Israelreleased kidnapped Shiite cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, but thegroup later suspended its threat.   President Francois Mitterrand of France said Sunday that hisnation's forces had no intention of intervening in Lebanon.   Moslem leaders, including the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, have said France may be preparing for a military interventionto help Christian forces who are fighting with the Syrian army andits Moslem allies.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiiteextremist factions holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon,including eight Americans. The longest-held hostage is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
