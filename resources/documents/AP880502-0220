While the Oliver Hazard Perry-class guided missile frigates,small vessels known as ``figs,'' will continue to dominate theGulf-based Middle East Force, the Navy has assigned three of itsmodern Spruance-class destroyers to the waterway, and for the firsttime in at least a year will have no guided missile cruisers onhand.   The cruisers, none of them less than 20 years old, have sharedthe brunt of Gulf escort and patrol duties with the frigates in thepast year.   The emphasis now is to be on more modern ships, primarily thedestroyers, which one officer said ``will be the backbone of theNavy in coming years.''   Assigning these and other types of ships to the Gulf will givesome ``balance'' to the overall surface fleet, rather than havingthe combat experience concentrated in mostly older vessels, saidthe officer, speaking only on condition of anonymity.   At the time the guided missile frigate Stark was hit and nearlysunk by an Iraqi missile May 17, 1987, the U.S. Middle East Forcehad four to six members. It more than doubled, then tripled, afterthe United States began escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers inJuly to protect them from Iranian attack.   More than 50 of the Navy's 230-plus surface combat ships havemade their appearance in the Gulf since then.   Although it varies from week to week as ships arrive and depart,the Gulf-based force recently stood officially at 16, including sixwooden-hulled ocean-going minesweepers, more than 30 years old, andtheir mother ship, the Trenton.   Several of the Navy's 31 Spruance-class destroyers, 7,810-tonships armed with a variety of long-range missiles, have served withcarrier battle groups supporting the Gulf convoy operations fromthe Arabian Sea, but none have been in the Gulf until recently.   One reason, officers say, is that their long-range missiles anddefensive weapons were not suitable for the confines of the Gulf,where close-in missile attacks and armed speedboats are consideredthe major threats.   The same was true of the older Adams-class destroyers, whichwere regulars in the Middle East Force for many years until theStark incident. Those ships, built in the 1950s and 1960s, areamong the last of the Navy's World War II-style vessels, althoughwith aluminum superstructures.   None of these ships carry the computerized gatling gun, called``sea whiz,'' designed to knock down incoming cruise missiles withstorms of spent-uranium shells. All other ships in the Gulf havebeen equipped with the rapid-firing ``terminal defense'' and otherimprovised defenses.   Recent arrivals were the Spruance-class destroyers O`Brien andMerrill and the 25-year-old guided missile destroyer JosephStrauss. They are being followed into the Gulf by at least oneother Spruance-class ship, the John Hancock.   The recent arrivals saw action during the April 18 clashes withIranian naval forces. The Strauss fired a Harpoon missile thatscored a direct hit on one of Iran's frigates and itself came underfire from Iranian missiles.   Since the Stark, 22 of its sister Perry-class ships have been tothe Gulf and four more will soon do their 2{-month turns in thewaterway.   In addition to the ``figs,'' the list includes 10 of the Navy's17 1960s-vintage missile cruisers, two of its seven helicopterassault carriers of the same era, and a variety of amphbiouslanding ships. No large aircraft carriers, battleships,state-of-the art ``aegis'' cruisers or nuclear-powered warshipshave operated in the Gulf.   When they entered service in the late 1970s, the boxy-looking,3,700-ton Perry-class frigates were much criticized as inadequatefor their intended role, which was providing anti-submarineprotection for battle groups.   But in the Gulf, the ``figs'' have carried the brunt of theescort duty, and the punishment.   One frigate, the Reuben James, set a tedium-endurance recordwith more than a dozen ``transits'' during its two-month duty tour.Another, the Samuel B. Roberts, hit a mine April 14 but survivedthrough the heroic efforts of its crew.   Cmdr. Edward Mann, skipper of the frigate Jack Williams, saysthe ships have proved in the Gulf that they can handle almost anysituation.   ``As late as 1980, admirals were still saying the FFGs didn'tbelong in the fleet,'' said Mann, 42, of Bucks County, Pa. ``Now weknow _ they can steam, they can deliver, they have sustainability.''   Another officer, asking not to be named, said there was no doubtthat the frigates have been ideally suited for the Gulf assignment.   ``But there's also a need to give other types of ships and theircrews the same chance for training under those conditions,'' hesaid.   The Pentagon announced the rotation of ships at an April 22 newsbriefing, in an effort to forestall speculation that the UnitedStates was enlarging its Gulf-based force following the one-dayseries of armed clashes with Iran on April 18.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 9</NOTE></DOC>
