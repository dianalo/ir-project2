About 38 megawatts worth.    The big maker of orange juice and other products says it intends to generate its own electricity from a $30 million, natural-gas fired plant it will build at its sprawling facility here. The plant is expected to begin operation in January 1990. Tropicana joins a growing list of companies that have built or will build their own generating facilities.    Tropicana, a unit of Seagram Co., currently is a customer of FPL Group Inc., a big utility holding company based in Miami. FPL expects to lose about $12 million in annual billings because of Tropicana's move.    George Zulanas, Tropicana's chief executive officer, said its power generating plan &quot;doesn't demean FPL -- we're not unhappy with them and we think it's a fine company.&quot; But he said Tropicana needs to produce huge amounts of steam for its manufacturing processes; that steam can also be used to produce electricity. So Tropicana intends to build a cogeneration facility that can convert its excess steam into power, something FPL isn't well-equipped to do.    &quot;We believe we can be 80% more efficient in our power production than&quot; a publicly owned, regulated utility, Mr. Zulanas said.    FPL won't miss the business much; it had 1987 revenue of $4.4 billion. But an FPL spokesman said it's trying to reach an agreement in which it would buy any excess power from Tropicana's plant. &quot;We're always looking for power to meet our projected growth,&quot; a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
