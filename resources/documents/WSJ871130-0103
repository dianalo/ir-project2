As a result, Dallas Corp. said it will take a net charge of about $5.9 million against fourth-quarter earnings. The company didn't say if the charge would result in a loss for the quarter.    The building products company had a loss of $1.6 million on sales of $93.3 million a year earlier. For 1986, net income was $1.3 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of $396.2 million.    Telectron, a closely held maker of automatic garage door radios, brought the suit in 1979, seeking about $69 million in damages.    As previously reported, Telectron alleged that Overhead Door Corp., which changed its name to Dallas Corp. in 1985, violated federal antitrust laws by tying sales of its garage doors to purchases of its radio controls over several years, beginning in 1971. That made it difficult for Telectron's radios to compete with Overhead Door's radios, Telectron alleged.    In May, Dallas Corp. lost one round in the suit when a federal judge in Miami ruled against the company. Judge Stanley Marcus cited evidence that a former Dallas Corp. official ordered company employees to destroy documents pertaining to the case. The judge said he didn't reach his decision on the merits of the case because the documents were destroyed.    Dallas Corp. appealed the decision. William Schochet, assistant general counsel at Dallas Corp., said the settlement terms prohibited him from elaborating on why the company decided to drop the appeal and settle the case.    Dallas Corp. shares closed Friday at $8.50, unchanged, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
