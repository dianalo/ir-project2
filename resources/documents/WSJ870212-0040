The operation may seemsimple and trouble-free. But it helps explain why the world'slargest auto maker is losing money in Europe.   GM's Adam Opel AG unit buys the oil pump's aluminum housing from a West German supplier and assembles the part. Yet the same pump could be purchased already assembled from Japan for less than what the German supplier charges for just the housing, plant officials say.    Why not buy it from Japan, then? &quot;We will, in the near future,&quot; says plant manager Heinrich Klein. But first, he explains, the change must be reviewed and approved by corporate higher-ups and then negotiated with the union. &quot;There are a lot of steps involved,&quot; he says.    Similarly, while GM is well aware of its problems in Europe, its cumbersome structure makes turning around its European operations tortuously complicated. Since 1980, GM has invested more than $7 billion in Europe. The result: modern, efficient plants, among the finest in the world. Yet GM incurred a loss of $343 million in Europe last year, its sixth deficit on the continent in the past seven years, while arch-rival Ford Motor Co.'s European unit earned $326 million in 1985, its most recently reported year.    Now, as part of a company-wide effort to boost lagging profits, GM has decided it can no longer tolerate such results. Efforts under way to reverse its European fortunes are crucial to the auto maker's overall turnaround strategy.    GM is closing its heavy-truck operations in Britain and is trying to streamline its European components businesses. But the principal focus of its streamlining efforts in Europe is the company's passenger-car operations. GM bought Opel in 1929, and it became the parent company's kingpin in Europe. Opel maintained its autonomy until last year, when it began reporting to GM's European corporate headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The new corporate structure was imposed to provide a continent-wide coordination of activities, something Ford did in the 1960s, and to &quot;de-Germanize&quot; GM's costly European car operations.    The immediate goal is to post a profit; GM executives say privately that the passenger-car operations have already reached that goal. But critics say that in a year of record volumes for the European auto industry, that isn't much of an achievement. They argue that market pressures demand that GM act more boldly.    The problems GM faces in Europe aren't as severe as those in the U.S. GM has increased its European car-market share by 32% since 1980, in sharp contrast to the steep declines it has suffered in the U.S. market. The European unit, moreover, has a better reputation for quality. Some new models, such as the Opel Omega, have been favorably received.    But the European passenger-car operation shares one trait of its American sibling: It costs GM more to build cars than its major competitors. Opel traditionally bought most of its parts and materials from German suppliers. German goods cost more because of higher wage rates and the high value of the German mark relative to other European currencies.    German-supplied parts cost an average 23% more than the same part from a British source, according to the preliminary findings of one study GM commissioned.    At Kaiserslautern, in southern Germany, where Opel produces axles, drive shafts and 1,500 engines daily, German companies account for 80% of the raw materials and parts supplied to the plant. That is in contrast to a ratio of about 50-50 at a nearby Ford of Europe factory.    Unlike GM, Ford makes greater use of non-German suppliers. As a result, Ford's production costs are 7% to 8% lower than GM's, analysts estimate. That translates into savings of $350 to $400 per car, based on an average $5,000 production cost. And with each company producing more than one million cars a year in Europe, total savings approach $500 million.    &quot;Our cost structure, that's our weakness,&quot; says John Smith Jr., the tough-talking former president of GM's Canadian subsidiary who last year assumed the No. 2 position at GM Europe.    GM is working to reduce costs. It plans to close one of its two assembly plants in Antwerp, Belgium, and, by rearranging shifts, produce as many cars from one plant as it now does from two. At the Ruesselsheim plant in Germany, it now takes 15% fewer man-hours to build the new Opel Omega than a predecessor model.    Yet some of GM's cost disadvantage will never be overcome. The company has car-parts and assembly plants at nine locations in Western Europe that are connected in a complicated and inefficient grid.    The Antwerp plants, for instance, get their stamped metal body parts -- door panels, fenders, bumpers -- from German GM facilities hundreds of miles away. Shipping costs can be greater than the value of the part, company officials acknowledge. But to overcome that penalty, GM would have to invest huge sums building a closer stamping plant.    Progress has even been slow with costs that GM can control. While Mr. Smith says he is leading a &quot;massive&quot; effort to buy parts from non-German sources, parts suppliers say it's business as usual.    &quot;We read (about GM's commitment to lowering costs) in the newspapers, but we don't hear it when we go to their purchasing people,&quot; says a sales manager at a British brake manufacturer. The manager, who asks not to be identified, says his company has submitted several bids to Adam Opel indicating a savings of at least 15% on selected brake parts compared with parts from Delco Moraine, the GM unit that supplies most of Opel's brakes.    &quot;The response is always the same,&quot; says the sales manager. &quot;It isn't a question of price, it's a question of policy.&quot; That policy, he maintains, is to continue purchasing from the GM source, regardless of price. A senior GM executive agrees. While Opel isn't required to buy brakes from another GM subsidiary, he says, &quot;there is indirect pressure to remain within the corporation.&quot;    Indeed, some Adam Opel officials complain that efforts to cut costs are hindered by tighter controls being imposed by GM's Detroit headquarters. For instance, some matters formerly left to local discretion, such as personnel decisions, now require Detroit's full involvement and approval.    ---          General Motors vs. Ford in Europe       European passenger car market, in percent                          1980          1986 General Motors ......... 8.4%          11.1% Ford .................. 11.0%          11.7% Japanese (all makes) ... 9.9%          11.8% Fiat* ................. 12.0%          12.5% Volkswagen** .......... 12.1%          14.6% Peugeot ............... 14.6%          11.2% Renault ............... 14.7%          10.6% All others ............ 17.3%          16.5% *1986 figure does not include 1.5% market share of recently acquired Alfa Romeo **1986 figure includes SEAT's 1.6% Market share Source: Data Resources Inc.   --- European Profit (Loss)          GM             FORD                               ----------------------                              (In millions of dollars) 1981                         ($427)            $289 1982                             6              451 1983                          (228)             281 1984                          (291)             147 1985                          (372)             326 1986*                         (343)             400 *Estimate Source: Motor Industry Research Unit, University of EastAnglia   (Revised WSJ Feb. 18, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
