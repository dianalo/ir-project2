(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker railed against thenews media but urged followers of his New Covenant Church to forgivehis accusers Sunday in his first public remarks since being indictedon fraud and conspiracy charges.   ``If the news media wasn't the biggest money-maker today, wouldthey still pay people $1 million to lie and tell stories?'' he saidduring a 20-minute message to about 400 followers. ``The love ofmoney is the root of all evil.''   ``They ask us, `Why don't you attack your enemies?''' Bakkersaid, his voice rising. ``The Devil wants me to renounce mysalvation and attack, attack, attack. The Bible says `Love yourenemies.'''   ``I'm not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies. I'm notgoing to lift a finger to vindicate me,'' Bakker said. ``That willput cold chills down your enemy's spine.''   Bakker also talked about his reaction to being fingerprinted andhaving his mugshot taken at the federal courthouse in Charlotte.   ``I looked up at all those wanted posters and I thought, `No oneis smiling _ so I smiled,''' Bakker said. ``If I'm going to be onthe walls of post offices, I'm going to smile.''   Bakker did not allow reporters inside the converted skating rinkwhere his New Covenant Church holds Sunday services. However, someof his remarks could be heard through the door.   Bakker has declined interviews since his indictment last Mondayon 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He and three of his formerassociates were indicted after a 16-month federal grand juryinvestigation of the PTL television ministry.   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy at PTL,were accused of diverting more than $4 million of their followers'money to support their own ``lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.They and the others are expected to appear Thursday before U.S.Magistrate Paul Taylor.   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting money waspaid to buy the silence of a woman with whom he had sex.   Meanwhile, PTL, which filed for reorganization under federalbankruptcy law in June 1987, goes on the auction block with itsHeritage USA theme park Monday at the order of a bankruptcy judge.   Analysts say it's unlikely creditors will get more than afraction of the $130 million they're owed.   It will be the second time in a month that court-appointedtrustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton will try to auction the 2,200-acreproperty, which includes a 500-room hotel, a water park, atelevision studio and a 2,000-seat church.   The only certain bidder, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, haslet it be known he intends to offer a total of less than $70 millioncash. A month ago, he said he would pay $115 million, $50 million ofit cash.   If the top bid doesn't satisfy U.S. Bankruptcy Judge RufusReynolds, the judge might shut down PTL and sell it piece by piece.   As Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, entered the building Sunday,he briefly talked about reports that more than 30 televisionministries were under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service.   ``They fear evangelism,'' he said.   Bakker, in introducing a fellow preacher at the service, made anapparent reference to former associate John Wesley Fletcher, who wasquoted by Penthouse magazine as saying he had a homosexualrelationship with Bakker.   ``I've learned people I gave $100,000 to weren't my friends,'' hesaid. ``It's wonderful to know you have friends. I'm talking aboutpeople who stick with you through thick and thin.''</TEXT></DOC>
