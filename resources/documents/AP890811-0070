The Commerce Department reportd Thursday that state taxcollections totaled $264 billion in the year ending June 30, 1988,compared with $246 billion in fiscal 1987.   Other states reporting big percentage gains included Texas, 19percent; Alaska, 18 percent; Kansas and Maine, 17 percent each;Florida, 16 percent, and South Dakota, 15 percent.   While Hawaii, Montana and Oklahoma posted the biggest percentagegains, Alaska recorded the highest state per-capita tax payments,$2,439. However, the Alaska payments included $818.7 million inseverance taxes on oil and gas production that skew individualincome tax payments.   Other per capita leaders were Hawaii, $1,866; Delaware, $1,543;New York, $1,462, and Massachusetts, $1,451. At the bottom of theper capita ranking were New Hampshire, $532; South Dakota, $665;Oregon, $770; Tennessee, $784, and Texas, $600.   The national per capita tax average was $1,077, the departmentsaid.   Only three states reported decreases in 1988 state tax revenue _Wyoming, down 9 percent, and Oregon and West Virginia, each down 6percent.   Taxpayers placed $36 billion in California's state coffers, thelargest collection reported. Other big revenue producers were NewYork, $26 billion; Texas, $13 billion; Pennsylvania, $12 billion;Illinois, Michigan and Florida, $11 billion each; and Ohio, $10billion.   Tax collections in those eight states totaled nearly half of thetaxes collected nationally.   South Dakota collected the smallest amount, $476 million.Ranking with it at the bottom of the tax collection list wereWyoming, $573 million; New Hampshire, $583 million; Vermont, $617million; and North Dakota, $633 million.   The department said general sales and gross receipts taxes werethe largest source of state tax revenues at $87 billion, up 10percent from 1987. Individual income taxes accounted for $80billion, up 5 percent, while corporate net income taxes rose 6percent to $22 billion.   ``The general sales tax is still the primary revenue source inmost states, accounting for more revenue than any other tax sourcein 23 of the 50 states,'' the department said, ``and in 18 of the39 states which impose both a general sales tax and an individualincome tax.   ``The individual income tax is the primary source of tax revenuein 24 states, while the severance tax is the primary source inAlaska and Wyoming,'' it added.   The Commerce report included data on state taxes only, most ofwhich was collected by a canvass of state offices. Revenue fromnon-tax sources such as federal government payments was notincluded.   In addition, the report did not include figures for the realestate taxes that are a primary source of revenue for local, asopposed to state, governments.</TEXT></DOC>
