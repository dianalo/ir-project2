(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Stephanie WilkinsonandM;The Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s Energy Systems division has more computingpower than any private facility in the country.andP;  That power ranges from aCray supercomputer in the basement running heavy finite-element analysis to alowly laptop PC running strategic planning meetings.andM;What is as important as the raw computing power is the fact that Westinghousehas a corporate culture that encourages business staff to champion newtechnology, said Jim Thomas.andM;Thomas, a senior engineer in the strategic planning department at the EnergySystems division, is one employee who has responded to this encouragement.andM;His official job is to help allocate the division's annual $80 million incapital spending, but a strong background in computing, an interest inbehavioral psychology and a supportive corporate culture have allowed Thomasto bring new technology to the strategic planning process at the Monroeville,Pa., facility.andM;For about three years, for example, Thomas has been championing groupdecision-support systems (GDSS), electronic tools that aim to make meetingsmore productive and to ease the notoriously unstructured decision-makingprocess.andM;''The information-center folks are too busy fighting fires to think aboutmeeting management,'' Thomas said.andP;  ''I was hired in the strategic planningdepartment because I had computer experience, I think, though it wasn't partof my job description when I arrived.''andM;Thomas' proudest accomplishment to date is introducing OptionFinder, aninteractive PC-based GDSS made by Option Technologies Inc. of MendotaHeights, Minn.andM;With OptionFinder, each meeting participant has a small numeric keypad, withwhich he or she votes on issues raised during the meeting.andP;  The keypad,hooked to a portable PC, dumps the electronic votes into the OptionFindersoftware, which instantly tallies them and produces a graph of the results.andO;The graphs, giving quick visual clues on areas of agreement and dispute, canbe projected on a screen at the front of the room by an LCD overheadprojector.andM;''Because everyone must participate, must push their button, the toolsencourage teamwork,'' Thomas explained.andP;  ''This in turn helps ensureparticipants will buy into the decisions made at the meeting.''andM;When meeting attendees haven't worked together before, too much time is spentsizing one another up, keeping a respectful distance -- and a closed mouth --before real issues are brought to the fore, Thomas said.andP;  These tools ''breakthrough the facade,'' allowing people to express opinions anonymously.andP;  Thistype of voting mitigates a subordinate's fear of offending his boss andensures that everyone is ''heard.''andM;''One user of this system told me his group accomplished in one afternoonwhat normally took two to three days of arguing,'' Thomas said.andP;  ''He saidthe group didn't necessarily like the decisions that resulted, but all agreedthey were best for the group as a whole.andP;  The teammanship these tools fosterare worth their weight in gold.''andM;Thomas decided to search for a tool to help build consensus about three yearsago, when he used written questionnaires in one of his monthly planningmeetings to sample opinion and was left with a pile of incomplete, incoherentdata.andM;''I was trying to make sense of over 14,000 'opinions,' '' Thomas recalled.andO;When an associate suggested a couple of PC-based tools, Thomas jumped.andM;''The day after the OptionFinder arrived, we had a big meeting of thecompany's general managers -- bigwigs.andP;  Unfortunately, after about 15 minutesof use, the system crashed because of a software bug.andP;  Naturally, themanagers voted to go back to the manual system for the rest of the meeting.''andM;Thomas recovered from the mishap, got the manufacturer to fix the softwarequickly and was back using it within six weeks.andP;  Since then, it's been usedin over 100 meetings.andM;Thomas has automated the meetings of general managers, corporate headquartersstaffers, union arbitrators and manufacturing personnel.andM;''I've gotten over the bow wave of resistance now,'' Thomas said.andP;  ''A lot ofpeople here have heard about it, either through a demo, the companynewsletter or word of mouth, and they're starting to come to me about it,''he said.andM;Support and promotion of the system have been left up to him, Thomas said,which he enjoys.andP;  ''Sometimes I'm told I'm in the wrong group, that I oughtto be with MIS,'' Thomas said.andP;  ''But I'm right where I want to be.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
