Both were createdin 1982 when the federal government removed the ceilings onthe maximum interest payable on bank and thrift deposits butdid not simultaneously reform the deposit insurance system.By allowing the highest bidder to raise funds with governmentguarantees, the U.S. enabled banks and thrifts to givedepositors returns that were too high relative to the risksthey were running. This can be called the deposit anomaly.   This government subsidy of interest payments todepositors, in turn, enabled banks and thrifts to lend toborrowers on overly generous terms relative to risks. Thiscan be called the credit anomaly.</LP><TEXT>   Over-generous credit is the bane of all financial marketsbecause it feeds speculative demand. And when speculationbegins to overwhelm fundamental demand and supply, the boomsand busts that have long characterized the history offinancial markets appear. It was just such a speculative boomthat the U.S. went through in the 1980s. We now face thecrash.   As a result, the savings-and-loan deposit insurance fundhas gone insolvent, and the bank insurance fund is nowteetering on the brink of insolvency. The U.S. needs morecapital in the banking system, but capital is just anothername for profitability. The deposit anomaly, however,undercuts the ability of well run depositories to takedeposits profitably, and the credit anomaly undercuts theability of strong lenders to extend credit on prudent terms.   Some want to repair this situation with tighterregulation. But down that path is the government deciding whogets credit and who does not. In any event, the evidence ofthe past decade indicates that regulation is not verysuccessful at controlling market forces.   Others want to cure the problem with market discipline.But the evidence of 600 years of banking history is that inbanking, &quot;market discipline&quot; is another name for panics. Itshould not be beyond the talent of American society toprovide its citizens and businesses with a secure place tokeep their money.   Where instead should the U.S. go? The best answer is toreform, directly, the deposit and credit anomalies at theheart of the problem. Specifically, interest-rate regulationon deposits should be reinstated for insured depositories.   Right now, the risk for federally insured deposits isbasically the same as for U.S. Treasuries of equivalentmaturity. Because it has less risk, a bank backed by thegovernment's guarantee should be able to raise money morecheaply than an uninsured institution. Deposit insurance is asubsidy of the deposit-taking function. Because of the creditanomaly, many institutions have used this subsidy to take onexcessive risk: Troubled institutions overbid for funds tokeep liquid and, in the process, erode the profits of eventheir strongest competitors, since everyone has to offerhigher rates to keep depositors from switching.   The deposit anomaly can be eliminated by limiting theinterest that insured banks can pay on deposits (and otherborrowed funds) to the rates paid by the U.S. Treasury. Inother words, if the six-month Treasury rate were 7 1/2%,insured banks would be allowed to pay a maximum of 7 1/2% fordeposits or other borrowed funds.   Talk of reimposing an interest-rate ceiling bothers manypeople. The ceiling that prevailed between 1934 and 1975 usedto suck liquidity out of the system whenever the marketinterest rate rose above the maximum banks could pay theirdepositors. By pegging the maximum interest rate on depositsto the market interest rate on Treasuries, the problems ofthe old Regulation Q would be avoided.   Of course, an institution that owned an insured depositorywould also need to be able to raise money in segregated,separately capitalized, uninsured subsidiaries by payingwhatever rate the market required. Thus, depositors wouldhave to make a choice. Depositors who wanted safety would puttheir money in the insured bank. Price-sensitive investorswould put their money in uninsured, segregated subsidiaries.   Analysis undertaken by my firm suggests that under such asystem most institutional investment money would leaveinsured banks for higher yields in uninsured bankingsubsidiaries or other money market instruments. That wouldremove some $450 billion of large domestic deposits and some$350 billion of large foreign deposits from insured banks, aswell as some $200 billion of smaller deposits. Altogether,more than $1 trillion of deposits and other borrowed fundswould leave insured banks and thrifts, significantly reducingthe bank insurance fund's total exposure.   To fix the credit anomaly, the legal lending limit shouldbe lowered to force federally insured banks to make onlyrelatively small loans. Under present law, most banks canlegally lend between 10% and 20% of their equity to a singleborrower. A bank can therefore commit its entire equity toonly five or 10 borrowers. Decrease the legal lending limitfor all banks with more than $100 million in equity capitalto 2% of their equity above the first $100 million and largeinsured banks would be forced to diversify their portfoliosand to put the bulk of their insured deposits in loans toindividuals, small businesses, and mid-sized companies. Bankscould, of course, make whatever loans they wanted fromsegregated, uninsured subsidiaries.   This system would force most large loans off the balancesheets of insured banks and into separately capitalizeduninsured banking subsidiaries or finance companies. Thiswould not unduly burden borrowers: It is small borrowers thathave few alternatives to bank borrowing. Large, creditworthyborrowers have many alternatives. There would be no need tolower legal lending limits for small banks, whose very sizekeeps them focused on small borrowers in their communities.The problem is with larger banks that have taken on enormousexposures to real estate and highly leveraged companies.   In combination, limiting the rates paid on deposits andlowering the legal lending limit would force the use ofinsured deposits back to those essential core bankingfunctions for which insured banks still uniquely add value.These reforms would help restore the profitability of insuredbanks. If insured banks had held to the loan loss rates thatprevailed before 1980, some $20 billion of last year's $29billion in insured bank loan losses could have been avoided.   Meanwhile, all of the non-core banking functions,including global money market activities and the underwritingof high-risk credits, would be forced out into themarketplace where the only regulation would be securitieslaw. This, of course, means that the U.S. must modernize itsentire system of regulating financial institutions. But,unless the deposit and credit anomalies are fixed first,financial modernization will fail.   ---   Mr. Bryan, a director of McKinsey andamp; Co., is the author of&quot;Bankrupt: Restoring the Health and Profitability of OurBanking System,&quot; to be published next month by HarperCollins.   910429-0072</TEXT></DOC>
