The smooth and continuous growth of phosphateadsorption followed a first order kinetics and the rate constants werefound to be of the order of 10/sup -3/ min/sup -1/. The results showedthat the adsorption in the system under study obeyed the Freundlich isotherm.The increase in temperature from 303 K to 323 K did not affect the processsignificantly. The adsorption kinetics of phosphate ions was highly dependenton the pH of the adsorption solution. On the basis of the present datathe nature and mechanism of the adsorption are discussed.
