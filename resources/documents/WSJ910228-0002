But Taipei hasgiven thousands of illegal workers from Asia and Africa untiltoday to leave Taiwan or face fines, taxes and detention.   These workers' dreams -- from jobs that few local laborerswould consider -- have come up against a law-and-ordergovernment intent on stopping the influx. Despite pleas fortime from struggling local industries and the Philippines,which fears a flood of returning workers, Taipei is stickingto its hard-line policy.   So far, about 18,000 illegal workers clutching passportsand plane tickets have registered with police to depart.Their total was estimated before the crackdown at 60,000 to150,000.   Separately, the British right-of-abode package for HongKong residents is a flop, despite a last-minute surge inapplications. Britain's offer of citizenship for as many as50,000 Hong Kong families expires today. Officials expected750,000 applications, but only about 41,500 were submitted.Meanwhile, demand for emigration visas to Canada, Australiaand the U.S. continues unabated, ahead of the colony's returnto Chinese control in 1997.                                                                                                          LEGAL EAGLES TO FLY EAST                                                                                                          Bonn, worried about the pace at which some property rightsand other legal questions are being resolved in the formerEast Germany, will spend 120 million marks ($78.8 million)this year to send judges and lawyers east. Without help, itcould take three years for the east to expand the legalsystem.                                                                                                          BULGARIA TO RETURN PROPERTY                                                                                                          The Communists who ruled Bulgaria unchallenged for fourdecades will return property to the impoverished state. TheSocialist Party, renamed after the Communists were ousted in1989, plans to hand back assets valued at about $52 million.The party recently estimated it owned property valued at $89million. Former Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov is widelyblamed for leading Bulgaria into an economic crisis.                                                                                                          WARSAW, PRAGUE TO COOPERATE                                                                                                          Poland and Czechoslovakia signed a military cooperationaccord. The pact won't result in a military alliance andisn't related to disbanding of the Warsaw Pact's militarystructures. It covers defense doctrines, informationexchanges between general staffs and cooperation in armsproduction. The two neighboring countries also will assume acommon stance in Vienna disarmament talks.                                                                                                          OWNING A HOME IN CHINA                                                                                                          Beijing city planners said the phasing out of welfarehousing, a cornerstone of socialist economics, has begun inthe Chinese capital. Citing a lack of state funds forrenovation, authorities bent on urban renewal are pullingdown crumbling old houses to build apartments that will besold to individuals. &quot;We are aiming at privatization ofhousing,&quot; a designer said at one of two newly completedprojects that introduce private home ownership to Beijing.The state has owned all real estate for more than 40 years.                                                                                                          JAKARTA, CAIRO ACT ON MONEY                                                                                                          To counter devaluation rumors, Indonesia's central bankmoved boldly to drain as much as eight trillion rupiah ($4.17billion) from the country's banks and to raise interestrates. The steps were viewed as likely to crush a new spateof currency speculation, despite fears it could crush someilliquid banks in the process. Separately, Egypt set up atwo-tier currency exchange system, a primary market and afree market for foreign currencies. The two rates will bemerged within a year and be subject to marketsupply-and-demand forces.                                                                                                          EC PUTS FARM PLAN ON HOLD                                                                                                          The European Community Commission put off proposingfundamental changes in the EC's huge farm subsidy programuntil later this year. The delay in the long-promisedrevisions could prove to be a setback for the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, which resumed inGeneva this week.   The EC's annual farm price package unveiled by thecommission calls for price cuts and production taxes aimed atkeeping a lid on runaway agricultural spending. RayMacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, made clear he wantsrapid adoption of the price package by farm ministers, so theEC then can negotiate revamping the costly CommonAgricultural Policy.   EC officials contended that the proposed price cuts shouldbe viewed as a positive sign by EC trading partners. But theyadmitted that the package would do little to meet demands bythe U.S. and other farm exporters that the EC slash exportsubsidies, which allow Europe to dump surpluses on worldmarkets.   Mr. MacSharry said the package would boost EC farmspending by seven billion European currency units to 32.5billion ECUs ($43.7 million) this year, within budget onlybecause of the proposed price cuts and output penalties.
