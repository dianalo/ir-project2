The mainpoints of support are set accordingly. They concern the cost degressionfor solar cells and modules (for small equipment), which can be achievedby mass production. Apart from these details, simulation models and thedevelopment of solar module circuit techniques are discussed and so areprototype plants for domestic supply with integrated hot water supply/waterdrainage and a test laboratory for photovoltaic plants. A demonstrationprogramme for photovoltaic solar energy plants was also supported. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
