For the year-earlier period, the real estate and retailing concern posted net income of 30.4 million dollars, or 67 cents a share.    But Robert Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that per-share earnings before extraordinary items for 1988 would exceed two dollars, as the company begins to benefit from the consolidation at Allied and from debt reduction. Campeau has about 44 million shares outstanding.    For the latest period, Campeau had a loss from continuing operations of 162.1 dollars, and a loss of 77.2 million dollars from Allied's discontinued operations. Revenue soared to 2.87 billion dollars from 202.4 million dollars a year earlier, with Allied contributing 2.66 billion dollars.    Campeau Corp. is selling 16 of 24 store divisions to satisfy a banking agreement that financed its $3.4 billion purchase of Allied late last year. Mr. Campeau said the asset-sale program has been &quot;very successful, way beyond our expectations.&quot; Only the sale of its Syracuse, N.Y.-based Dey's Department Stores division remains to be completed. Mr. Campeau predicted that total proceeds from the sales will be about $1.2 billion.    Sales of Allied real estate have generated a further $400 million, allowing Allied's bank debt to be halved to about $1.65 billion, he added.    Mr. Campeau said that Allied earlier this month arranged to refinance its bank debt with Security Pacific Corp. at an interest rate of about 0.75% above the 30-day London interbank offering rate. The refinancing effectively satisfies the earlier banking agreement.    Campeau said its loss resulted from non-cash charges, including 24.5 million dollars for amortization of goodwill, 93.3 million dollars for depreciation and 53.3 million dollars for amortization of financing costs. &quot;The loss (from continuing operations) isn't as bad as it seems,&quot; said Timothy Walker, a senior vice president.    Mr. Campeau said New York-based Allied plans on 1988 sales of $3.53 billion, compared with $3.3 billion projected for 1987.    The retailing outlook in the U.S. next year looks good, he said, and &quot;shows no sign of recession.&quot; But Allied has lowered its costs, so &quot;even if it is a slow year, we'll do very well.&quot; He cited staff cuts that will save Allied $120 million a year.    Mr. Campeau, who has been managing Allied's revamping, said he expects Robert Morosky, Allied's new president and chief operating officer, to succeed him as Allied's chief executive within six months. &quot;When that happens, Bob Campeau will go back to real estate,&quot; he said.    While Campeau is trying to sell certain of its mature Canadian real estate properties to reduce debt, Mr. Campeau said, &quot;we have on the drawing board plans for in excess of $1 billion of U.S. real estate construction,&quot; including office buildings and shopping malls.    In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday, Campeau closed at 15.875 dollars, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
