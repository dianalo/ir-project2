James Barth, chief economist of the Office of ThriftSupervision, said preliminary figures indicate that Sandamp;L red inkwill be at its lowest point since a $1.8 billion loss in the thirdquarter of 1988.   Thrifts last year lost a record $13.4 billion. Official figuresfor the July-September period of this year will not be releaseduntil next month, but if Barth's projection proves correct, lossesfor the first nine months of this year will total $9.7 billion, ontrack for a slight improvement for all of 1989.   Barth, speaking at the annual convention of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions, said losses in the latest quarter wereconcentrated heavily in the approximately 260 institutions undergovernment control, although the rest of the industry also lostmoney.   He attributed the reduction to government steps to close orrescue failed Sandamp;Ls and said he expected the decline in losses tocontinue.   ``The fact that we've gotten rid of a lot of institutions ...suggests that the numbers should get smaller over time,'' Barthsaid.   In Washington, meantime, the thrift supervision office announcedtoughened capital standards designed to prevent further Sandamp;Lfailures. It estimated that 800 thrifts with assets totaling $600billion would not be able to meet the new requirements when theytake effect Dec. 7 and would be subject to restrictions on growth.   In September, the industry continued to shed assets for thefourth consecutive month in an effort to meet new capital standardsgoing into effect next month, Barth said. Institutions reducedtheir portfolios by about $15 billion, up from a record $13.4billion shrinkage in August, he said.   Deposit outflows totaled about $9 billion, up from $5.1 billionin August and close to the record $10.8 billion in January, he said.   Meanwhile, Sandamp;L executives, looking back on their industry's mostturbulent year in five decades, are wondering if they fought alittle too hard to wrap themselves in the American dream of homeownership.   When leaders of the league mapped strategy last year for thedebate on a taxpayer bailout of the industry, they decided theirkey argument would be that Sandamp;Ls are needed to finance housing.   Congress listened. Legislation enacted Aug. 9 authorized $50billion to rescue or close an estimated 500 failed Sandamp;Ls. However,it also required the survivors to devote more of their assets tohome lending.   Starting July 1991, 70 percent of thrift assets must be inhousing, up from 60 percent currently.   As Sandamp;L executives gathered today for the 97th annual conventionof the industry's oldest and largest trade group, the 70 percentrequirement was the top item on a list of changes they wantCongress to make in the three-month-old bailout bill.   ``We think this may have gotten us into the overkill area,''said league President Frederick L. Webber.   ``It's a classic example of getting killed by a myth,'' saidBert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.``They bought their own propaganda and now they're choking on it.''   The problem is that the new rules are taking effect as advancingtechnology makes it easier for competitors to enter the mortgagemarket and on the eve of a decade expected to see the housingsector weaken in response to the aging of the Baby Boom generation.   James W. Christian, chief economist of the league, estimatedthat new households in the 1990s will require 12 million to 13million new housing units, down from 15 million units in the 1980sand 17.5 million units in the 1970s.   ``However you varnish it ... weak aggregate demand for housing... is going to be part of the picture of the 1990s,'' he wroterecently.   According to Ely, technology has split the home financingbusiness into three parts: mortgage funding, mortgage servicing andmortgage origination.   Insurance companies and pension funds are taking over thefunding part by purchasing securities from Freddie Mac and FannieMae, large congressionally chartered companies that buy mortgagesto back the securities they sell.   Since anyone can sell a mortgage to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,Sandamp;Ls now must compete for origination business against commercialbanks and private mortgage companies.   And, because most thrifts are too small to compete effectivelyagainst large, computerized mortgage-servicing operations, whichcollect homeowners' monthly payments, they are losing that part ofthe business as well, Ely said.   Webber, however, said, ``We are confident ... there will be asuccessful thrift industry provided we can correct some of the moreonerous parts of'' the Sandamp;L bill.   Among the other changes the group wants:   _A reduction in the industry's contribution to the bailout. The12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which are industry owned andprovide low-cost loans to member Sandamp;Ls, ar being tapped for $2.6billion in retained earnings through 1991. And, they're supposed tocontribute $300 million a year to help pay the interest ongovernment borrowing for the bailout.   _An increase in the limit on loans to one lender. The bill cutsthe limit from 100 percent of capital to 15 percent. Under the oldstandard, one default could push an Sandamp;L into insolvency. But Webbersaid 15 percent may be too stringent and suggested somethingbetween the two figures would be more appropriate.   _Equal deposit insurance premiums for both thrifts andcommercial banks. Both types of institutions will have to pay morefor deposit insurance. But the thrift rate will be higher than thebank rate until 1998 when both types of institutions will pay 15cents for every $100 in deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
