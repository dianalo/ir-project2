The seam is separated by 2 partings not morethan a dozen cm thick: an illite-montmorillonite parting and a claystoneparting. The illite-montmorillonite layer swells under the influenceof moisture. The illite-montmorillonite layer formed a sliding planeduring sedimentary rock inversions. Kink zones were created. Pressureincrease caused by overlying strata and stress concentrations causedstylolitization of the coal seam. Structural properties of the coal seamcan be found in other coal seams in the Upper Silesia basin. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
