Customers and consultants said the announcement shouldaddress some of the concerns that customers and investorshave developed about Computer Associates in the past year.</LP><TEXT>   Computer Associates, the largest independent softwarecompany, had been growing nearly 50% annually in the pastseveral years and generates more than $1 billion of revenue ayear, but it stumbled badly in the summer. The acquisition ofCullinet Software Inc. took much longer to work through thanexpected. Sales stalled while customers waited to see howComputer Associates would handle the overlap in the twocompanies' product lines.   Those problems then brought to a head existing concernsabout Computer Associates; Gartner Group Inc., amarket-research firm, says the Garden City, N.Y., companyranks at or near the bottom of its user-satisfaction surveys.   Investors quickly got nervous, too, and have stayed thatway. Some analysts already were saying they believed thecompany was using aggressive accounting procedures during itsnumerous acquisitions to make results look far better thanthey were. So, at the first sign of weakness, the stocktumbled 50%. It closed Friday at $13 a share, down 12.5cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, stillsome 40% below its 52-week high.   In an attempt to get some momentum going again, ComputerAssociates executives said they will, in effect, promise tocross-pollinate their numerous products. The best-known ofthose are mainframe and minicomputer products that makecomputer systems run more efficiently. The company also sellsdata bases and packages aimed at specific markets, such asbanking.   The Computer Associates executives said features inproducts for International Business Machines Corp. hardwarewill be made available on Digital Equipment Corp. machines,and vice versa. The ability to grab data from relatively new&quot;relational&quot; data bases will be provided in older systems,known as hierarchical or navigational data bases. Softwarethat generates reports from a banking package may be madeavailable on other products.   The strategy plays into the major concern that corporatecustomers have these days: Now that they've spent millions ofdollars on all this hardware and software, how are theysupposed to get it all to talk to each other? The strategyshould also reassure customers that Computer Associatesdoesn't plan a wholesale abandonment of many of the productsit has acquired.   Still, the announcement doesn't include a timetable, andsuch broad efforts usually take several years to implement.They also almost always prove to be tougher to develop thanexpected.</TEXT></DOC>
