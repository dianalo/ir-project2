The Catch: You'll be out of work after 1996.</LP><TEXT>   Those are some of the job characteristics that Atlanta hasin mind as city officials begin a search to fill what may bethe toughest spot in sports over the next five years: chiefoperating officer for the 1996 Summer Olympics.   Atlanta, which won the right to play host to the Games inSeptember, last week selected Heidrick andamp; Struggles,Chicago-based executive recruiters, to find a person able tohandle construction of more than $500 million in athleticfacilities, coordination of 70,000-plus volunteers andmicroscopic scrutiny by national and international media.   And the winner has to recognize that his or her serviceswill no longer be required after the Games end.   &quot;Some very fine candidates&quot; will probably disqualifythemselves, says Patrick S. Pittard, managing partner forHeidrick andamp; Struggles's Atlanta office, because they &quot;won't beable to take a break in their careers.&quot;   Taking a break is something Mr. Pittard and his colleaguesmay be unable to do for the next two months. That's becauseAtlanta's Olympic organizers have specified that they wanttheir man or woman by Feb. 28. &quot;It's an incredibly shortamount of time,&quot; says Mr. Pittard, who adds that a search fora position of this type would normally take twice as long.But Atlanta itself is running up against a March 18 deadline,set by the International Olympic Committee, for having theexecutives in place who will actually manage the Games.   So far, Olympic organizers and Heidrick andamp; Struggles are abit sketchy on what or who they're seeking. They're notlooking for someone who wants to be the next Peter Ueberroth,the man who ran the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. The job ofchief executive officer in Atlanta will likely be filled byBilly Payne, a local attorney and the driving force behindthe city's bid to win the Olympics.   Mr. Payne, however, &quot;is smart enough to know what hedoesn't know,&quot; says Mr. Pittard. And what he doesn't know --or has had virtually no experience in -- is the large-scalemanagement a chief operating officer will perform.   &quot;Chances are the executive we're looking for will not comefrom the sports field,&quot; Mr. Pittard says. &quot;Most of the job isnot sports-related; it's commercial construction,communications, public relations, human resources, financeand marketing.&quot; (One of the positions, that of a senior vicepresident, will be hired to deal with athletics.)   No salary has been set. Mr. Pittard says only that it willbe in the &quot;six figures,&quot; adding: &quot;A lot of people that willtake this {job} will be financially secure anyhow.&quot;   Whoever gets the nod will have his or her hands full fromthe first day. Battles have already erupted over the locationof the yet-to-be built Olympic stadium, as well as the makeupof the executive board that will manage the Games.   But there will be no shortage of applicants. WhileHeidrick andamp; Struggles says it will evaluate several hundredexecutives in hopes of providing about a dozen finalists forAtlanta to consider, the local Olympic committee itself hasalready received more than 5,000 resumes for all types ofjobs, including a fair number who want to be &quot;high-levelexecutives,&quot; says a spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
