The aide, Bob Grady, told a luncheon Wednesday at the ClimateInstitute that the Bush administration also would advocate growingmore forests and clearing fewer of them.   The Climate Institue is a non-profit group trying to callattention to environmental threats from climate changes.   Bush pledged during the presidential campaign to convene aninternational conference on the ``greenhouse effect'' causing globalwarming and said he would bring a ``conservation ethic'' to theWhite House.   He was not specific, though, on what results should come from aconference on the greenhouse effect. He said only that it should``develop a strategy for tackling this global problem.''   ``His experience is that international cooperation is indeedpossible in these matters,'' said Grady.   ``I sincerely believe George Bush will use his foreign policyexperience, informed by the conservation ethic, to work towardglobal consensus.   ``The agenda is clear ... We must work together to reduce theemissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.   ``We must plan to phase out CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) thatdestroy stratospheric ozone. We must stem the alarming net loss offorests around the world.''   Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the principal gaswhose buildup in the atmosphere trapping the earth's heat is blamedby many scientists for the warming trend.   CFCs, which contribute importantly to the warming, already arethe subject of an international agreement to reduce production by 50percent by 1998 because they destroy the high-altitude layer ofozone that protects the Earth's surface from the ultraviolet rays ofthe sun.   These chemicals are used abroad for aerosol propellants andeverywhere for solvents, refrigeration fluids and plastic foamproduction.   Forest clearing, in addition to other harm such as removal ofwildlife habitat, releases carbon tied up in plant tissue whichbecomes carbon dioxide when burned. A growing forest, however,removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.   Brazilian forest burning to create farmland has been estimated toaccount for 10 percent of the 5.6 billion tons of carbon dioxidethat reaches the atmosphere every year.</TEXT></DOC>
