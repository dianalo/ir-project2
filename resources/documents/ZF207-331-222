by the worm degraded substantially,unless remedial steps were taken.andP;  Eventually such infected computers wouldcome to a halt.andP;  These symptoms were caused by uncontrollable replication ofthe worm clogging the computer's memory.andP;  The worm, however, did not modifyor destroy any system or user files or data.andM;* Based on anecdotal and other information, several thousand computers wereinfected by the worm.andP;  The commission has not systematically attempted toestimate the exact number infected.andP;  Many thousands more were affected in thesense that they had to be tested for infection and preventive measuresapplied even if the computers were not infected.andP;  It appears that theoperation of most infected and potentially affected computers and of theresearch done on those computers was brought to a halt in order to applyremedial or preventive measures, all of which required the diversion ofconsiderable staff time from more productive efforts.andM;Mitigation AttemptsandM;* Morris made only minimal efforts to halt the worm once it had propagated,and did not inform any person in a position of responsibility as to theexistence and content of the worm.andM;Violation of Computer Abuse PoliciesandM;* The Cornell Computer Science Department &quot;Policy for the Use of the ResearchComputing Facility&quot; prohibits &quot;use of its computer facilities for browsingthrough private computer files, decrypting encrypted material, or obtainingunauthorized user privileges.&quot;andP;  All three aspects of this policy wereviolated by Morris.andM;* Morris was apparently given a copy of this policy but it is not knownwhether he read it.andP;  Probably he did not attend the lecture duringorientation when this policy was discussed, even though he was present oncampus.andM;IntentandM;* Most probably Morris did not intend for the worm to destroy data or otherfiles or to interfere with the normal functioning of any computers that werepenetrated.andM;* Most probably Morris intended for the worm to spread widely through hostcomputers attached to the network in such a manner as to remain undiscovered.andO;Morris took steps in designing the worm to hide it from potential discovery,and yet for it to continue to exist in the event it actually was discovered.andO;It is not known whether he intended to announce the existence of the worm atsome future date had it propagated according to this plan.andM;* There is no direct evidence to suggest that Morris intended for the worm toreplicate uncontrollably.andP;  However, given Morris' evident knowledge ofsystems and networks, he knew or clearly should have known that such aconsequence was certain, given the design of the worm.andP;  As such, it appearsthat Morris failed to consider the most probable consequences of his actions.andO;At the very least, such failure constitutes reckless disregard of thoseprobable consequences.andM;Security Attitudes and KnowledgeandM;* This appears to have been an uncharacteristic act for Morris to havecommitted, according to those who knew him well.andP;  In the past, particularlywhile an undergraduate at Harvard University, Morris appears to have beenmore concerned about protecting against abuse of computers rather than inviolating computer security.andM;* Harvard's policy on misuse of computer systems contained in the HarvardStudent Handbook clearly prohibited actions of the type inherent to thecreation and propagation of the worm.andP;  For this and other reasons, thecommission believes that Morris knew that the acts he committed were regardedas wrongful acts by the professional community.andM;* At least one of the security flaws exploited by the worm was previouslyknown by a number of individuals, as was the methodology exploited by otherflaws.andP;  Morris may have discovered the flaws independently.andM;* Many members of the UNIX community are ambivalent about reporting securityflaws in UNIX out of concern that knowledge of such flaws could be exploitedbefore the flaws are fixed in all affected versions of UNIX.andP;  There is noclear security policy among UNIX developers, including in the commercialsector.andP;  Morris explored UNIX security issues in such an ambivalentatmosphere and received no clear guidance about reporting security flaws fromhis peers or mentors at Harvard or elsewhere.andM;Technical SophisticationandM;* Although the worm was technically sophisticated, its creation requireddedication and perseverance rather than technical brilliance.andP;  The worm couldhave been created by many students, graduate or undergraduate, at Cornell orat other institutions, particularly if forearmed with knowledge of thesecurity flaws exploited or of similar flaws.andM;Cornell InvolvementandM;* There is no evidence that anyone from the Cornell community aided Morris orotherwise knew of the worm prior to its launch.andP;  Morris did inform onestudent earlier that he had discovered certain security weaknesses in UNIX.andO;The first that anyone at Cornell learned that any member of the Cornellcommunity might have been involved came at approximately 9:30 p.m.andP;  onNovember 4, 1988 when the Cornell News Service was contacted by theWashington Post.andM;Ethical ConsiderationsandM;* Prevailing ethical beliefs of students towards acts of this kind varyconsiderably from admiration to tolerance to condemnation.andP;  The computerscience profession as a whole seems far less tolerant, but the attitudes ofthe profession may not be well communicated to students.andM;Community SentimentandM;* Sentiment among the computer science professional community appears tofavor strong disciplinary measures for perpetrators of acts of this kind.andO;Such disciplinary measures, however, should not be so stern as to damagepermanently the perpetrator's career.andM;University Policies on Computer AbuseandM;* The policies and practices of the Cornell Computer Science Departmentregarding computer abuse and security are comparable with those of othercomputer science and many other academic departments around the nation.andM;* Cornell has policies on computer abuse and security that apply to itscentral facilities, but not to departmental facilities.andM;* In view of the pervasive use of computers throughout the campus, there is aneed for university-wide policy on computer abuse.andP;  The commission recommendsthat the Provost establish a committee to develop such policy, and that suchpolicy appear in all legislative and policy manuals that govern conduct bymembers of the Cornell community.andM;* In view of the distributed nature of computing at Cornell, there is also aneed for a university-wide committee to provide advice and appropriatestandards on security matters to departmental computer and network facilitymanagers.andP;  The commission recommends that the Vice President for InformationTechnologies be asked to establish such a committee.andM;COMMISSION COMMENTSandM;The commission believes that the acts committed in obtaining unauthorizedpasswords and in disseminating the worm on the national network were wrongand contrary to the standards of the computer science profession.andP;  They havelittle if any redeeming technical, social or other value.andP;  The act ofpropagating the worm was fundamentally a juvenile act that ignored the clearpotential consequences.andP;  The act was selfish and inconsiderate of the obviouseffect it would have on countless individuals who had to devote substantialtime to cleaning up the effects of the worm, as well as on those whoseresearch and other work was interrupted or delayed.andM;Contrary to the impression given in many media reports, the commission doesnot regard this act as an heroic event that pointed up the weaknesses ofoperating systems.andP;  The fact that UNIX, in particular BSD UNIX, has manysecurity flaws has been generally well known, as indeed are the potentialdangers of viruses and worms in general.andP;  Although such security flaws maynot be known to the public at large, their existence is accepted by those whomake use of UNIX.andP;  It is no act of genius or heroism to exploit suchweaknesses.andM;A community of scholars should not have to build walls as high as the sky toprotect a reasonable expectation of privacy, particularly when such wallswill equally impede the free flow of information.andP;  Besides, attempting tobuild such walls is likely to be futile in a community of individualspossessed of all the knowledge and skills required to scale the highestbarriers.andM;There is a reasonable trust between scholars in the pursuit of knowledge, atrust upon which the users of the Internet have relied for many years.andP;  Thispolicy of trust has yielded significant benefits to the computer sciencecommunity and, through the contributions of that community, to the world atlarge.andP;  Violations of such a trust cannot be condoned.andP;  Even if there areunintended side benefits, which is arguable, there is a greater loss to thecommunity as a whole.andM;This was not a simple act of trespass analogous to wandering throughsomeone's unlocked house without permission but with no intent to causedamage.andP;  A more apt analogy would be the driving of a golf cart on a rainyday through most houses in a neighborhood.andP;  The driver may have navigatedcarefully and broken no china, but it should have been obvious to the driverthat the mud on the tires would soil the carpets and that the owners wouldlater have to clean up the mess.andM;Experiments of this kind should be carried out under controlled conditions inan isolated environment.andP;  Cornell Computer Science Department faculty wouldcertainly have cooperated in properly establishing such an experiment hadthey been consulted beforehand.andM;The commission suggests that media exaggerations of the value and technicalsophistication of this kind of activity obscures the far more accomplishedwork of those students who complete their graduate studies without publicfanfare; who make constructive contributions to computer science and theadvancement of knowledge through their patiently constructed dissertations;and who subject their work to the close scrutiny and evaluation of theirpeers, and not to the interpretations of the popular press.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
