users mustbuy a special interface device to connect the modem to a cellularphone.andP;  The interface 'fools' the modem into thinking it isworking with a conventional phone line with a dial tone.andP;  Oldercellular systems were bulky and heavy, but today's systems run offinternal batteries and are much lighter.andP;  Three differentmanufacturers have developed cellular modem protocols, and eachhopes its design will become standardized.andP;  Spectrum CellularCorp's SPCL is the best established product.andP;  Some laptop vendorsare now building complete units that combine a laptop, cellularphone transceiver and cellular modem in a single box.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Cellular radioModemsStandardsLaptop computersData Communications.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Cellular Modems in Need of Industry StandardandM;Uses of battery-powered laptop and portable computers, who are already freefrom electrical power, can now also have freedom from the tyranny of thetelephone line.andM;Thanks to the growth of cellular-telephone services, a laptop-toting travelerdoesn't have to be tied to a telephone cord to send orders to the factory,keep in touch with electronic mail from headquarters or send a facsimile.andO;With the proper software and modem connections, wireless communication ispossible.andP;  But it's not easy.andM;Currently, only a small percentage of people are taking advantage of thistechnology.andP;  &quot;Less than 10 percent of our customers aresending data now, butit's growing&quot; in popularity, said Dale Fox, manager for data services atAmeritech Mobile Communications in Schaumburg, Ill.andP;  &quot;The cellular businesshas been geared to voice, and the technology has been geared to that.andP;  Onlynow is it starting to change to voice and data.&quot;andM;Using cellular modems to transmit data is more complicated than using aconventional modem.andP;  Difficulties in the packaging of cellular datacommunications have slowed some of the growth of cellular-based dataapplications, according to Gary Brunt, a consultant to the CellularTelecommunications Industry Association in Washington.andM;In addition to a cellular phone, users must buy a special interface device toconnect the modem to the phone.andP;  Most cellular phones don't have extra jacksfor modem connections, and cellular gear it not like a regular telephone.andO;Because it's a two-way radio, the cellular phone doesn't use a conventionaldial tone.andM;A special interface units is needed to generate a fake dial tone and fool themodem into thinking it's dealing with a conventional phone line.andM;The lack of standards makes buying an interface unit a complicated process.andO;&quot;There's no standard interface for cellular phones,&quot; Brunt said.andP;  &quot;You haveto buy an interface unit for the specific model of the phone you have.&quot;andM;Another drawback is the weight of the older cellular systems.andP;  Early machinescombined an interface unit with the modem, which resulted in a bulky,external model that required external power from a 12-volt car battery.andO;Because today's systems run off an internal battery, they're much lighter.andM;In terms of performance, cellular data communications usually require anerror-correction protocol, due to the usually noisy telephone lines throughcellular technology.andP;  &quot;The quality of the connection varies according to howfar you are from the cell transmitter and how many people are on the system,&quot;Fox said.andM;Signal quality also changes if the phone is in a mobile vehicle.andM;Another problem is the cellular-system architecture, which consists of manycell transmitters, each covering a small area and transferring calls betweencells as users move around an area.andP;  The transfer, or &quot;handoff,&quot; of callsdisrupts communications for a second or two, which is tolerable for voicecommunications but deadly to modem communications.andP;  Data communications cancrash if the line isn't in constant operation.andM;Three cellular-modem manufacturers have developed protocols that they hopewill become the standard for cellular data communications.andM;SPCL from Spectrum Cellular Corp. is the best-established product currentlyavailable.andP;  SPCL has been installed in many cellular systems.andP;  Severalcellular systems offer Spectrum's Bridge and Span system, which provideserror correction on the cellular side of the call while connecting mobileusers to non-SPCL modems over conventional phone lines.andM;SPCL now has competition, though.andP;  Microcom Inc. has included MNP Class 10 inits series of error-correction/data-compression protocols, and Telebit Corp.andO;is selling its own Packetized Ensemble Protocol (PEP) with its modem.andP;  Inmost cases, users need two modems from the same manufacturer to implement theprotocols on both sides of the connection.andP;  (See story, Page 133.)andM;Even with the confusion over competing products, there has been someimprovement in both the packaging and performance areas.andP;  The interfere unitsbetween the modem and the cellular phones are becoming smaller and lighter.andM;Spectrum Cellular recently developed SmartCable, which weighs less than onepound and plugs into the case of an NEC P300 phon.andP;  Motorola Inc. hasdeveloped a hand-held cellular phone with a modem interfere and RJ-11 jackbuilt into the phone.andM;Although cellular phones are becoming more sophisticated, modems are startingto slim down.andP;  Most of the existing units are external models that needconnections to bulky power supplies, such as a 12-volt car battery.andM;The lure of wireless communications has not gone unheeded by the major laptopmanufacturers.andP;  Many of them are starting to come out with internal modemsthat will work on either conventional telephone lines or via a cellularphone.andP;  Toshiba was first out of the gate with a modem made by Spectrum.andO;Other vendors, including NEC, are working on their own entries.andM;&quot;Now that the technology has come down to a more manageable form factor, itwill open up the possibilities for all sorts of applications,&quot; said DavidDorsey, senior product manager for laptop planning at NEC America Inc.'sMobile Radio Division in Richardson, Texas.andP;  &quot;Cellular can be used in avariety of applications, such as the field sales force.andP;  If you're taking anorder in a customer's office, you don't want to bother him for a phoneconnection.&quot;andM;There are also more choices beyond the bulky combinations of carrying acellular phone, modem and laptop.andP;  Some firms build a complete unit thatincludes all three components in one box.andM;Intelligent Technology Corp. is one such vendor.andP;  Its unit combines a laptop,a cellular-phone transceiver built into the motherboard of the laptop, and aMicrocom modem that uses the MNP 10 error-correction protocol.andM;Powertek Industries Inc., is taking this approach one step further.andP;  Ratherthan forcing a user to use a particular laptop, the company has designed adocking-stationlike interface that links any laptop to a unit that contains acellular-phone transceiver and a modem.andM;Cellular-service providers are aiming at providing increased capacity andbetter signal quality over the next few years as systems move from analog todigital transmission mechanisms.andP;  However, it will be a while before datausers get the benefit of the upcoming digital technology.andP;  The preliminaryindustry standards for digital cellular service include no provisions fordata.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
