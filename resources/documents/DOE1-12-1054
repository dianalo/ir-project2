In terms of the fracture state of thecontrolling bed, the authors suggest that the basic patterns of surfacesubsidence can be divided into equilibrium and non-equilibrium subsidences,the latter can be further divided into bending, bending-cave-in and cave-insubsidences. Having made a comparison analysis of the subsidence behaviorbetween the different patterns, the paper points out that the principleof superposition is only approximately applicable to the non-equilibriumsubsidence, and is not applicable to the equilibrium subsidence. Thedysymmetry of both sides of subsidence trough along the strike profileand the dispersity of the deviated distance of the (quasi-) inflectionpoints are explained theoretically. Utilizing the principle of subsidencemechanism, the methods of computation for the equilibrium and the non-equilibriumsubsidences have been given. 12 refs., 7 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
