Hamoud al Rqobah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, has beenpublicly stating such a target for weeks, most recently atlast week's meeting of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries in Geneva. That level of production issignificant for Kuwait both economically and psychologicallyand represents the tiny sheikdom's official OPEC quotaallotment set before the Iraqi invasion and devastationhalted Kuwait oil flow.</LP><TEXT>   But will war-ravaged Kuwait be able to do it? &quot;Godwilling,&quot; one Kuwaiti industry official at the OPEC meetingsaid. Said another about the oil minister's pronouncements:&quot;I wish him luck -- it's almost impossible.&quot;   Even officials of Bechtel Corp., which is overseeing thereconstruction of Kuwait including its oil industry, areconcerned. &quot;They're going to have to be very aggressive tomeet their targets,&quot; warned one of the construction company'sfive senior managers appointed to oversee the work there.   How quickly Kuwait regains its stature as an OPECheavyweight will have a major impact on global oil prices.Sluggish oil demand world-wide has made it more difficultthan usual for the group's ministers to divvy up theproduction pie. At their recent meeting in Geneva, theyappeared to be more divided than they have been for years,and oil prices declined based on the shaky accord theyattained. That dissonance reigned even though the ministersdidn't have to deal with the anticipated reentry of Kuwaitinto the OPEC production fold. &quot;What are they going to dowhen Kuwait and Iraq come back on the scene?&quot; asked oneindustry expert who was in Geneva to observe the meeting.   Neither Kuwait nor its war foe Iraq have been pumpingsignificant quantities of oil into the market since Iraqinvaded Kuwait. Kuwait has been out of the market because ofthe devastation of the war, and Iraq because of a UnitedNations ban on its exports.   As recently as the 1970s, Kuwait was pumping 3.5 millionbarrels of oil a day. But the government choked back thatproduction partly to conserve the resource. Kuwaiti oil menclaim that before Saddam Hussein's invasion in August 1990,the emirate was pumping 2.2 million barrels daily even thoughits assigned quota was 1.5 million barrels. It was, in fact,this overproduction that triggered Iraq's invasion.   The Kuwaitis have been reworking their oil fields --primarily the most profilic Burgan, Ahmadi and Magwa -- at arapid pace. The speed of the recovery, which will cost theKuwaitis as much as $13 billion for the oil industry and $2billion for the petrochemical sector, will play a major rolein whether the disarray at last week's meeting will becomemore pronounced at the next meeting in April.   But although work in Kuwaiti oil fields is continuingunabated, there are signs that the pace has fallen offslightly. Goals to attain certain production targets haveslackened -- oil men there are currently behind schedule by10,000 barrels of daily production, one Kuwaiti insider says.   There is a desperate need for drilling rigs, the oil mensay. And stalled negotiations with British Petroleum over acontract to reconfigure the Kuwaiti fields is slowing therate of recovery as well.   Currently, Kuwait's total daily oil output is 620,000barrels -- of which 490,000 barrels are being pumped withinKuwait proper and the remainder from the so-called neutralzone it shares with Saudi Arabia. And a hard-driving plancalling for the workover of some wells and the drilling ofnew ones is, by Mr. al Rqobah's reckoning, expected tocatapault the emirate's production to an average for thesecond quarter of 812,000 barrels a day. That figure, whichincludes Kuwait's share of the neutral zone, is the newproduction ceiling allotted it at last week's OPEC meeting.   Mr. al Rqobah is in a race against time. The longer ittakes Kuwait to get its industry up and running, the moremarkets it loses to other producers and the less clout itcarries within the OPEC power structure, where muscle ismeasured by oil output. Mr. al Rqobah has the support ofKuwaiti oil men, who say they are under tremendous pressureto meet the stringent targets set by the oil ministry. Butthey also know that Mr. al Rqobah is trying to stake out asbig a piece of OPEC's production pie as he can. &quot;He's justtrying to hold onto his quota,&quot; one Kuwaiti said.   To meet Mr. al Rqobah's targets, the Kuwaitis need as manyas 20 drilling rigs working the fields. At present, there areonly 10 rigs in the emirate, and one is so huge it isn'tbeing used to drill the relatively shallow wells. Another rigis on its way from Egypt, and the oil men are looking tolease some already in the Persian Gulf area.   In addition, only four to six of the gathering centershave been rebuilt. Before the war, there were 27 of thesefacilities that separate oil from gas and then route them tothe appropriate destinations. The centers are consideredcritical because all oil produced in the fields must flowthrough them.   Many of these centers are still twisted hulks of metallying out in the desert. Bechtel officials say they arecannibalizing the devastated facilities to rebuild some ofthe others.   A reconfiguration of the Kuwaiti oil fields currentlyunder way could return output to two million barrels a day bythe end of 1993. But attaining that goal will depend to someextent on how quickly they can obtain an agreement with BP.Because Kuwaiti oil wells flowed prolifically with littlemechanical prompting before the damage by the Iraqis, the oilmen there say they haven't the sophistication needed to dothe best job of reconfiguring the fields.   Negotiations have been dragging on for almost six months,with the oil company asking unusually high fees for itsservices, the Kuwaitis say. The British oil company is anespecially good candidate to help rework Kuwait's oil fields.BP was very active there before the nationalization of theoil industry, and it has retained much of the geologicaldata. BP declined to comment other than to acknowledge that&quot;talks have been going on for quite some time.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
