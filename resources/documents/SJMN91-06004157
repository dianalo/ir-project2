He has been convicted ofmurder, but is awaiting retrial on the issue of special circumstances, whichcould lead to the death penalty.;    Inmates are allowed to attend religiousservices in the jail and to use religious implements there, but may not keepthem in their cells. Inmates may have in their possession only items issued bythe jail or included on an approved list of items, such as books.;    &quot;It's ahigh-security jail,&quot; said Richard Reynolds, the attorney handling the county'sdefense. &quot;It is a fairly standard practice that in these sort of modern,high-tech jails, that this is the best thinking on how to control contraband,weapons, etc.&quot;;    The Rev. Raymond Breton, chancellor of the Oakland Diocese,said he was not familiar with the case, but said he could understand jailofficials' safety concerns.;    Keeping the religious implements in theircells &quot;wouldn't be essential from the point of view of the church,&quot; he said.;   The appellate decision, written by Chief Judge Alfred Goodwin, upheld anearlier ruling by U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel. It was initiallyissued in October but was not published until Thursday -- establishing it asprecedent throughout the 9th Circuit, which covers the Western United States.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BARRY WITT, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910104  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  408  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 4, 199100004157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
