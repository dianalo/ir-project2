Steve Frankel: The No.andP;  1force is the user demand for connectivity.andP;  There are so many computersystems around the world, and the user demand to integrate these individualcomputer systems into one large network is forcing the OSI market.andP;  That sameneed was to some degree a forcing function  in  the  TCP/IP market.andM;Can I digress and discuss more about why OSI has a wider range andOpportunity than TCP/IP? TCP/IP went a certain distance to provideconnectivity in that it built a transport stack that allowed machines tointercommunicate in a local area network environment.andP;  it also addressedthree applications: file transfer, electronic mail, and remote login accesscapabilities.andM;It was expected that OSI would duplicate the first successes of TCP/IP.andP;  Whatyou saw initially evolving Out of the OSI market was a transport stack, onefor the wide area and one for local area environments, and the initial, majorapplications developed were akin to what the TCP/IP network market did-filetransfer, a stronger opportunity in electronic mail in the X.400 arena, andthe specification for virtual terminals, or the remote login facilities.andM;The difference is that the world has decided that interconnectivity, orinteroperability, is an important issue-a mandatory requirement of thecomputing environment in general.andP;  Networking unto itself yields productivitytools that are not derived by islands of computers unto themselves.andP;  The realrichness of the OSI model is beginning to show, in that there are now properdirectory services specifications-x.500, which we'll talk about later, Iwould think.andM;Beyond that, for the first time we're seeing standards for remote databaseaccess and other applications.andP;  In the database environment in particular, itwill be attractive to have different environments, be they computermanufacturer-derived or independent software vendor-supplied, and still havea vehicle [OSI] to intercommunicate in an effective way, as though it were aseamless interconnection.andP;  This wide-ranging set of applications is reallywhat's going to make OSI into a very attractive vehicle for connectivity inthe future.andM;We were talking about market forces driving the acceptance of OSI.andP;  Userdemand is the first one.andP;  The second one is due to a little bit of a forcingfunction-the U.S.andP;  GOSIP [Government OSI Protocol] mandate, where the U.S.andO;government has mandated that computing systems installed and purchased by theU.S.andP;  government after August 1990 must utilize OSI as their standardnetworking facility.andM;The benefits are that government agencies will see the viability of the OSIapplication and the OSI services, and get a fuller product [than] they mighthave.andP;  This forced computer manufacturers to make an investment in OSI soonerthan they might have otherwise.andP;  Clearly, now that they've made thatinvestment to bring products to the government market, they will bringproducts to the commercial market.andM;A third force is the international market, in particular Europe, whereinterconnectivity is a very important issue.andP;  In fact, [Retix officials] seethe European market growth in many OSI environments outpacing the activitiesin the U.S.andP;  We see strong growth in the U.S.andP;  market by manufacturersgetting themselves ready to address the GOSIP market, and in particular theX.400 commercial market.andP;  But the international market is demandinginteroperability.andP;  We see a faster paced environment, resulting in computermanufacturers and others moving toward OSI [in Europe].andM;The fourth reason is productivity derived in a corporate environment fromelectronic mail.andP;  it's well accepted that a networkwide electronic mailsolution is a productivity tool.andP;  We at Retix are a fine example of thebenefits of electronic mail as a corporate tool for communication.andP;  When wemoved into this new building, our electronic mail network was down for awhile.andP;  And we lost productivity.andM;The last issue driving OSI is the viability of the applications within OSI,in particular, the electronic mail application, X.400.andP;  I don't personallybelieve a new [protocol] stack is what the world wanted-it wasn't a keyattribute of OSI.andP;  The key attribute of OSI must be that it solves problemsthat customers have.andP;  And so it [OSI] is solution driven, not technologydriven.andM;One of X.400's real values is that it appears to be the only viable andindustry-accepted interoperability vehicle for electronic mail.andP;  It's thetool by which islands of electronic mail will be interconnected for the firsttime.andP;  It is solving a real-world problem.andP;  It has meaning as an application,as a solution, not purely as a technology.andP;  It will clearly be followed byother important applications as well, X.500 in particular, and file transfer.andO;Although, to be quite candid, there are many solutions to intersystem filetransfer.andP;  FTAM [File Transfer, Access, and Management] will be a good,viable one because it's a standard.andP;  But electronic mail has never had aninteroperability solution before.andM;LAN: What are some of the other major OSI applications we can expect to see?andM;Frankel: You mentioned X.500, the directory service.andP;  The electronic mailindustry today is dominated by IBM in their PROFS and DISSOS environments andDEC in their VMS mail and All-in-one environment.andP;  If you look at theelectronic mail industry in general, it is an industry where the applicationshave been installed on islands-for example, an isle of IBM mainframe andusers of that IBM mainframe.andP;  And maybe people within that IBM network arecommunicating electronically.andP;  And then in the same corporation, in theengineering lab, you might find a DEC machine, and members of that communityare communicating.andP;  And maybe also there are Sun workstations, where thereare members of that community.andP;  And then there's a financial application,which may have IBM or may be a different application.andM;To make a long story short, electronic mail has been an island-orientedapplication.andP;  As the e-mail environment grows, with everybody tied togetherboth within and outside of a company-all of a sudden, these networks get verylarge.andP;  As these networks get larger, we need a vehicle equivalent to theYellow Pages-a vehicle to define addresses for everybody and allowintercommunication in a simple-touse, attractive way.andP;  X.500 will be thatvehicle.andP;  I can see X.500 following with the growth of X.400, and e-mail ingeneral.andM;Another very important application is network management.andP;  The user basetoday is demanding essential network management systems that manage theirentire network, regardless of who manufactured the elements of the network.andO;We've seen network management move very rapidly to SNMP [Simple NetworkManagement Protocol], which is a TCP/IP-based standard, with future growthinto the CMIP [Common Management Information Protocol] environment, whichwill be the OSI environment.andP;  Retix will incorporate SNMP management agentsin its future internet working products because the market demands it.andP;  Butwe also see demand in the OSI network management environment.andP;  The value ofthat is to have one system that can manage the multiplicity of equipment on anetwork.andM;Another extremely important application, one that is further behind in thestandards environment but potentially extremely important, is the one Imentioned before, the remote database environment.andP;  We can see thestandardization of remote database procedures among all of the databasesuppliers.andM;LAN: What progress is being made in that area now?andM;Frankel: A key event has been the formation of a user group in the SQL[structured query language] access area, composed of many of the suppliers ofdatabase packages.andP;  This organization is attempting to utilize the OSIstandards for remote database access as the vehicle for interchange ofdatabase transactions  between  their products.andP;  LAN: Who are some of theother major competing  players&quot; in the OSI marketplace?andM;Frankel: If you don't mind me bragging a little bit, we believe our marketshare in the OEM sector, as the supplier of OSI software technology, exceeds70 percent.andP;  We view our primary competitor to be not another vendor but thelarge computer manufacturers with the resources and talent to implement theirown OSI technology.andP;  They represent a larger threat to us, or a competitivethreat to us in terms of expanding our market share.andP;  We don't see anyparticular vendor with enough market share to be ranked second, if you will.andM;LAN: How does Retix plan to penetrate this market niche?andM;Frankel: When you think of companies who have announced their in be majorplayers in the OSI arena-of bringing the facilities of OSI to their users andtheir environments-you've got to keep DEC, Hewlett-Packard, NCR, Phillips,and Olivetti in mind.andM;[Although] each of those companies has internal resources for OSIdevelopment, Retix licenses its OSI technology to over 140 companies.andP;  Of themajor companies who have announced OSI products, most are in fact customersof Retix.andP;  We think we have most of the market.andM;LAN: Retix says that adoption of OSI by the global networking community willoccur in three phases: the technology development phase, the selectiveinstallation phase, and the enterprise wide employment phase.andP;  We're wellpast phase one.andP;  Could you elaborate on phases two and three?andM;Frankel: Sure.andP;  Just to reiterate: Phase one was the technology developmentphase.andP;  We suggested that phase was in the approximate time frame of 1985through the end of 1988.andP;  When we say technology development, we mean thatthe task for us as a company was to create the pure technology, the OSIprotocol stacks, and to provide that technology on a license basis tocomputer manufacturers.andP;  It's a very complex, sophisticated technology, veryrich, robust.andM;We take pride in having helped expedite the technology evolution by the factthat we were so active in the creation of the technology.andP;  Even in phase twothe selective installation phase, which we say began in early 1989 and laststo the end of 1991-there's continuing technology development.andP;  As newstandards emerge, as standards get modified, and as additional companies jumpon the bandwagon for implementation of OSI, there's ongoing technologydevelopment.andM;In the selective installation phase, selected applications [and]implementations of the OSI standards would be employed in different segmentsof the market as a test, as a trial, as a solution to a real-world problemthat was not found in any other technology.andM;What does that mean? In the commercial [OEM] market, for example, we have thebeginnings of a viable X.400 business, with implementation beginning in 1989.andO;It's getting stronger and healthier today.andM;The selective installation phase began in the government sector as a resultof GOSIP.andP;  The government has already come out for bids for procurements thatmandate GOSIP.andP;  We've won many of those bids, so getting ourselves preparedfor that market has been beneficial for us.andM;We're also in a selective installation phase in other applications.andP;  Forinstance, we're involved in a very large banking application in Germany,where FTAM [the OSI file transfer protocol] is the application of choice, andmost of the major banking centers of Germany will implement FTAM across anOSI stack.andP;  I think our prediction as to the phasing of the market seems tobe holding true.andM;To get ourselves prepared for phase two, we built Retixmail, an end userX.400 product line that is Microsoft Windows-based.andP;  We created theOpenserver as an X.400 gateway product on a PC LAN to allow proprietaryelectronic mail products to interface to X.400 and build on thisinteroperability tool.andP;  We've developed a family of migration products fromthe TCP/IP environment to OSI, in particular in regards X.400 from SNMP toX.400, and in the file transfer world, from FTP to FTAM.andP;  We see this as avehicle to allow the TCP community to begin [migrating] to X.400, filetransfer, and OSI in general.andM;We see the selective installation phase in process and growing nicely, andwe're taking a very active role in it.andP;  I'll talk about the enterprisewideemployment phase, which we think will begin in 1992, in one minute.andM;There's one event that I'd like to tell you about-an event that I think iscritical to the growth of the end-user market for OSI.andP;  Retix will make amajor announcement in June that [brings] fundamental improvement in theperformance and viability of OSI in a local area network environment.andP;  Wewill announce and demonstrate a new OSI transport stack whose performance andsize of code-meaning viability in a PC environment-will surprise the industryat large.andM;We think it will answer the question once and for all of whether or not afast, viable transport stack can be implemented in OSI.andP;  We think theindustry will recognize for the first time that OSI as a transport vehicle ona local area network environment is efficient, fast, and will fit within thedomain of a PC memory system.andM;This [will put to rest] one of the issues people raise when they question theviability of OSI: People recognize that OSI is a rich and robust transportand communication stack, but [they also] question whether it is a slowertransport vehicle than other competing technologies, either proprietary orTCP/IP.andM;Getting back to your question [about the progression of the OSI market), thelast phase of the growth or maturation is the enterprisewide deploymentphase, beginning in 1992.andP;  For the first time, we'll see companies [who have]gone through the selective installation phase, tested the viability of theapplication, and begun to make a fuller and more complete commitment to OSI,and [they'll] begin to deploy  enterprisewide  OSI-based networks.andM;LAN: Regarding your planned June announcement: When exactly and where are youplanning to make it?andM;Frankel: I'm glad you asked that.andP;  Retix will host, beginning on June 6, whatwe're calling the International OSI Forum, a three-day forum, tentatively setfor San Diego, Calif.andP;  We'll invite major [OSI] participants around theworld-from the government and commercial sectors, industry pundits, marketresearchers, and [we'll] spend three days talking about OSI and itsprogression-where it's succeeding, where it's going, applications beingimplemented today in OSI, products in place and marketed.andM;The first day will be an industry day-where's the market going, what are theprognosticators' views of the market, fa look at] real applications, and anoverview of the market's and the technology's status.andP;  The next two days willbe focused on Retix offerings, and the participants' views of where we'reheaded.andP;  We'll be asking users and government agencies to verify that ourtechnology plans are in line with where they [want] us to go.andM;LAN: How long has your new OSI stack been in development, and what led to itsrevision?andM;Frankel: For quite a while.andP;  We saw that OSI was a winner in the wide areanetwork.andP;  We observed OSI as being attractive in the wide area networkenvironment, and clearly applications like X.400 were making the wide areanetwork implementation of OSI technology grow and prosper.andM;In the local area network environment, the OSI transport stack was notproceeding at the pace we think is achievable.andP;  We think the perception wasthat the stack was clearly a better, well-thought-out transport stack.andP;  Butsome viewed it as less efficient or effective than other protocols.andP;  We setout to address that [with the new, slimmer stack].andP;  We're pleased [withit]-we can actually demonstrate it today.andP;  You'll see a formal demonstrationin June that I think will impress the industry at large.andM;LAN: Did users perceive that your OSI stack was too large?andM;Frankel: Too large in code space and not efficient enough in terms of speedof transfer and throughput.andM;LAN: In the X400 market, does Retix believe that being first in the marketensures success?andM;Frankel: It's certainly a key factor in our growth, in that X.400 is nowbecoming a well-accepted interoperability standard for electronic mail.andP;  ButI must confess that in the OEM arena we were not first.andP;  In fact, a Canadiancompany, our most aggressive competitor with an OEM product, was first withX.400.andP;  Retix proceeded along that path  slightly  behind  this  othercompany.andM;We've taken over the market share in that business, and in source-leveltechnology licensing, we clearly are the market leader.andP;  Of course, we havebeen the market leader in the X.400 segment of the OSI market.andP;  inparticular, we were the first company to announce and demonstrate anative-mode X.400 PC-LAN based product, demonstrated at ENE [EnterpriseNetwork Event] in 1988.andM;And we were the co-founders with Telenet of the X.400 API Association, withthe intent to define a proper X.400 interface for applications running in aPC LAN or other LAN environment.andP;  That organization defined a gateway levelAPI, and Retix was the first to implement technology based on it.andP;  We werealso the first to implement a gateway product that utilizes that API.andP;  It'scalled our Openserver 400 family, and it runs on DOS, Novell's NLM [Netwareloadable module] environment, UNIX, and other environments are coming in thenear term.andM;You're probably familiar with our joint announcement with Novell in Boston,at Networld in February, where we announced a relationship with Novellwhereby Novell would include the [Retix implementation of the X.400] API withits Netware 386 product.andP;  Netware 386 will come standard with an interface toX.400.andM;We've also implemented the Openserver 400 running in the NLM environment tointerface directly with it.andP;  [This means] a single server in a PC LANenvironment can for the first time act as a file server and a complete mailserver.andP;  This is the first implementation of such a cost-effective,single-server application for electronic mail and file sharing services.andM;LAN: What about OS/2-specific versions of your products ? You have DOSversions that will run with Microsofts LAN Manager as a client, and you'vejust mentioned Netware.andP;  Are you developing OS12 products for LAN Manager,too?andM;Frankel: Yes, I can announce that we will, in fact, have an OS/2 [LANManager] Openserver 400 product near term.andM;LAN: How does the move to the more powerful CPUS, such as Intel's 80486s,affect the OSI market?andM;Frankel: It's actually quite a positive event for OSI technology.andP;  A 486platform offers a more capable, faster processor.andP;  You can expect the fileserver in the Netware world to be even more robust.andP;  A 486-based serverrunning a full X.400 communication server, as well as acting as a fileserver, is very attractive.andM;LAN: Describe how Retixmail and X.400 mail differ from what you might call amore traditional kind of e-mail product, such as cc:mail or 3Com's 3 + Mail.andM;Frankel: First of all, Retixmail was designed to implement the full X.400feature set-all of the X.400 facilities.andP;  Retixmail is a user-agent family ofproducts, and the Openserver 400 is designed to utilize the X.400 APIAssociation's application program interface [API] so that it interfaces toall of the mail pipes, including the cc:Mail pipe.andP;  The target for RetixMailwas to demonstrate the viability of X.400 in a user environment.andP;  Weimplemented native-mode X.400 within the user agent itself.andM;One of the values of RetixMail is that it is Gosip-compliant.andP;  Because it wasdesigned to work hand in hand with X.400's MTA [message transfer agent], itis a Gosip-compliant product.andP;  I want to stress, however, that the keydirection for Retix is to open the market for cc:Mail and others to utilizeX.400 via our Openserver products.andP;  One of the contracts we recently signedwas, in fact, with cc:Mail, and cc:Mail is utilizing Retix's Openserver 400as its gateway to X.400.andM;I would expect that many [e-mail] manufacturers will enrich their useragents-their products-to encompass all the features of X.400.andP;  If thathappens, our investment in RetixMail will have achieved its goal.andP;  We willcreate a large user base of X.400 users, we will have strong partnershiprelationships with all of the major PC LAN e-Mail suppliers, and we will helpcreate a very large, growing market with opportunities for all of us.andM;LAN: How large is the e-mail market? Certainly there are a lot of companiesout there with e-mail products.andM;Frankel: if you cover the total population of e-mail users, the large,dominant users are those running in the IBM and DEC worlds.andP;  The PC LANe-mail market, where we've focused our attention, is much smaller, althoughgrowing quite rapidly.andP;  While I'm not giving you exact statistics on thenumber of e-mailboxes, it's a very fast paced market.andP;  With the LAN industrygrowing at a fast pace, more and more of those networks install electronicmail.andP;  And with X.400 as the first standard vehicle to allow mainframes andminicomputers and workstations-the PC clients on PC LANs-to intercommunicate effectively  and seamlessly, you will see that market grow very rapidly.andM;LAN: What kind of percentage rate of growth do you foresee?andM;Frankel: We're not predicting, although the percentages will be very high.andO;For the first time, the technology moves from islands to a fully meshednetwork, akin to the voice network today.andP;  With companies like U.S.andP;  Sprint,MCI, ATandamp;T, and other public data networks offering X.400 services, we've gotthe vehicle for intercommunication across continents.andM;LAN: Could you describe what X 500 is, why it's important, and explain someof the major issues you dealt with in developing it?andM;Frankel: Yes.andP;  X.500 is, if you will, an electronic Yellow Pages.andP;  itprovides an electronic vehicle to look up, in a distributed-directoryenvironment, the address, which is akin to a telephone number in the voicenetwork, of the party a PC user [wants] to have a dialogue with.andP;  [It allows)user clients on desktop workstations, without any knowledge of the networklayout, to get address information from this distributed directory.andP;  It's anautomated tool based on the OSI standards for addressing.andM;We view X.500 as an extremely important application, one that will follow thepath of X.400 as X.400 grows.andP;  At Retix, we're familiar with electronic mailnetworks that exceed 80,000 users.andP;  There's no rational way to implementthese kinds of networks and manage them without essential electronicdirectory services.andM;When you expand a corporate environment to communicate electronically withthe world at large, and as buying and selling and invoicing and billingbetween companies migrates to the electronic world, an automated directorysystem-a distributed electronic directory-becomes mandatory.andP;  And EDI[electronic data interchange] will utilize X.400 for the delivery ofinformation from one location to another.andM;X.500 has been the most sophisticated development project Retix hasundertaken.andP;  Our Unix-based X.500 product is the richest, fullest productever developed by Retix.andP;  It's also the most expensive project we've everundertaken.andM;LAN: Why was it such an expensive, difficult process?andM;Frankel: The size of the databases involved is one reason.andP;  The fact that it[the X.500 product) must have an integrated database-that it's more than justa protocol stack, it's more than an implementation of a protocol engine.andO;It's a full system that has to have, internal to it, a full database.andP;  Andbecause it is both a user agent and a server, it has to provide serverfunctions, as well as the user functions to access the server, to request adirectory service.andP;  it also is distributed in nature.andP;  It can be central, butit's also distributed.andM;With X.500], you have to build the protocol to allow it to be in sync withall the other elements of the distributed directory service-it's a verysophisticated standard.andP;  We've had to go way beyond the basic implementationof the protocol engine and, in fact, build a very sophisticated, veryexciting product from our standpoint.andM;LAN: How long has your X. 500 product been available?andM;Frankel: We've been shipping the portable version [Retix's operatingsystem-independent version designed for licensing to OEMS] since 1988.andP;  Westarted shipping the UNIX version, which is the full-function product, at theend of 1989.andP;  We're now proceeding toward end-user versions of our X.500server products; some of our products, like the Openserver 400, will havedirectory user agents embedded in them.andP;  This will happen in 1991.andM;LAN: Retix has a strong history of OEMing its products to other companies.andP;  Iunderstand that Retix is now buying other companies' products.andP;  Is this true?andM;Frankel: Yes.andP;  We decided a little over a year ago that the demands on Retixas the market-leading supplier of OSI technology in the world-plus the factthat we have 140 OEM major accounts-meant we alone could not meet the needsof the entire market for OSI technology.andP;  We had to move towardstrategic-alliance relationships with other companies to help us meet theneeds of our customers.andM;We made that decision first in the OSI arena, where the demand-even if wehired another 1,000 software people-was so great we still couldn't implementeverything our customers would like us to.andP;  We've created partnerships withsome very good software companies who have excellent communicationstechnologies.andP;  We've had them implement products with us on a joint basis orimplement them for us, purely by their team.andM;We had an element of our X.400 product done for us that way, with very goodsuccess.andP;  Most of our TCP-TO-OSI migration products, which allow a customerrunning in TCP environment to rapidly, easily, and seamlessly migrate intoOSI, were done for us on a strategic-alliance basis by another company.andO;We're completing a product on a strategic-alliance basis to bring our X.400technology, not to UNIX or DOS or OS/2, but to a proprietary operatingsystem, where we saw a real market opportunity.andM;We're now beginning to look at strategic alliances in our internetworkingbusiness.andM;LAN: Let's move to another of Retix's markets: The bridge has becomesomething of a commodity item, and Retix was among the first to sell bridgesat rock-bottom prices.andP;  With this cost erosion reducing margin, how do youplan to compete in this area? Frankel: Retix initially came out with alow-cost local bridge to gain position in a market where it was not firstinto the market with a product.andP;  As we've added value and enhancements andnetwork management and higher throughputs to that bridging product, we'veactually seen our prices increase.andP;  And the marketplace has been verycomfortable with paying a little higher price for a better-performingproduct.andP;  We've been able to improve the performance of our product.andP;  inMarch of 1989, we introduced our first T-1 remote bridging product.andP;  There,our target was not [to be] the price leader but the performance leader.andM;We've migrated from the low-price supplier to a supplier with a full familyof products, with a graphical network manager.andP;  We do not see margins erodingsubstantially in that market.andP;  We've seen new competitors coming in.andP;  Butlast year, our internetworking business grew more than 150 percent.andP;  Not onlyare we preserving a strong position and a growing position in that market,our market share grew substantially last year, and we're forecasting veryattractive growth in our market share this year as well.andP;  L  AN: If I were anend user who didn't know much about OSI, but / knew that it was somethingimportant, and you had two minutes, or five minutes, what would be the keythings you would tell me about OSI?andM;Frankel: I would say that investments in OSI should be started on a smallscale and should be viewed as a learning experience, to ensure that yourinvestment yields a proper return.andP;  And this return might be added value.andP;  Inthe case of X.400, interoperability between a PC platform and a minicomputerand a workstation and a mainframe is substantial value, not to be derived byany other technology.andM;Test the waters.andP;  implement a low cost cc:mail product with our OpenServer400 gateway or RetixMail or a TOPS server or one of the other [email)products, and interface it to interoperate with users on your IBM machine oryour DEC machine.andP;  Show the value that interoperability and its connectivityadvantages bring to your corporation, to your environment.andM;It's our prediction that one investment in this kind of solution to a realworld problem will open the gates to your use of OSI products and technologyfor years to come.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
