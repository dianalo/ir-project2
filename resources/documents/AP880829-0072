SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Strike leaders said thousands of workersjoined a stoppage at a huge southeastern steel mill today whenmanagement tried to reopen it two weeks into Poland's worst laborunrest since 1981.   Word of the broadened strike at the Stalowa Wola steel and heavymachinery plant came a day after Communist authorities said theymight let Solidarity leader Lech Walesa take part in broad-basedreconciliation talks.   Management had ordered the 18,000-worker plant closed Fridaybecause of a strike that began a week ago, but allowed workers intothe yard this morning and more than 5,000 joined the roughly 1,000strikers, said Piotr Niemczyk of the Solidarity Information Centerin Warsaw.   Phone calls to management at the defense-related plant were notanswered. But state-run Polish radio said seven plant departmentswere affected. It accused strikers of ``entering workingdepartments by force, making operation impossible.''   On Sunday, Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski endorsed the ideaproposed by authorities of a ``round-table'' discussion with strikeleaders.   In a speech broadcast to the nation at the end of a two-daymeeting of the communist party's policy-making Central Committee,he directed his most severe criticism at the party-appointedgovernment of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner.   Gen. Jaruzelski said that by failing to deal with economic andpolitical tensions, the government had helped precipitate thestrikes that began Aug. 16.   The general, who heads the communist party, refrained fromdirectly blaming the Solidarity free trade union movement for thestrike wave and hinted at a government shakeup in the near future.   Communist party spokesman Jerzy Majka said the government wasprepared for reconciliation talks without any preconditions, butadded that he had no information on when such talks could begin.   He called Walesa ``one of the possible candidates'' forparticipation in such talks, but added that no one could take part``as a representative of an illegal organization.''   ``It's up to the other side to make the first move,'' Majkaadded.   In addition to higher wages to offset inflation of nearly 60percent, the strikers have demanded demand the legalization ofSolidarity, which was banned after being crushed in a 1981 militarycrackdown.   Walesa last held a meeting with high-level communist authoritiesin early 1982 before he was released from internment.   In Gdansk, Walesa rejoined striking workers at the Leninshipyard Sunday morning, injuring himself slightly as he hauledhimself over the 7-foot fence after a police officer tried to stophim, aides said.   Solidarity estimated today that about 13,500 people wereoccupying 10 strikebound workplaces. About 20 enterprises wereidled at the height of the strike wave.   In the Baltic port of Szczecin, talks between management andrepresentatives of striking dockers broke off and a managementattempt to hold talks with striking bus employees failed as well,the state-run news agency PAP reported.   But in the southwestern city of Jastrzebie, workers at theJastrzebie coal mine agreed to end their strike after a meetingwith management, PAP reported. Only the July Manifesto coal mine,where the labor unrest began two weeks ago, remains on strike inthe Silesian town not far from the Czechoslovak border.   Police evicted strikers from several workplaces last week, butthere was no use of force to end strikes over the weekend.   In Gdansk on Sunday, police blocked about 400 people who set offafter a mass at St. Brygida's church from approaching thestrikebound Lenin shipyard a few blocks away. The crowd dispersedpeacefully.   The latest bid for national reconciliation by Jaruzelski, wholed the 1981 crackdown on Solidarity, appears to leave the decisionon potential discussion partners for the round table up to theopposition.   Efforts earlier this summer to draw senior Solidarity advisersinto informal talks with low-ranking party and government officialson the economic malaise met with only limited success.   The idea for round-table talks was proposed Friday by InteriorMinister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who said they would be to take upgrievances of striking workers after the strikes, as long as theyobserved the nation's legal and constitutional order.   Jaruzelski made no immediate recommendation to shake upMessner's government, but said party deputies would decide whenParliament next meets, most likely in September.   Ending its meeting, the central committee passed a resolutionendorsing continuation of economic and political reform with no``half-way measures,'' but condemning ``law-breaking anddestruction,'' a reference to strikes.   On the meeting's opening day, a number of the centralcommittee's 230 members launched harsh attacks on the governmentand their speeches were later televised.   ``We are not used in the party to criticizing the governmentfrom the rostrum of the central committee. That we have always donein the family, silently,'' Jaruzelski said. ``Now we are finishingwith that practice.''</TEXT></DOC>
