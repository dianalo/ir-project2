The stepped-up violence coincided with parliamentary elections inIsrael that pitted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likudagainst Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' leftist Labor Party.

People ranfrom their houses to put the fire out,'' he told a reporter.   The woman, Yocheved Farbish, 23, was in serious condition atJerusalem's Shaarei Zedek Hospital, hospital officials said. Assisand his friend Uzi Kazdan, 26, the driver of the car, suffered lightfacial burns.   Police said about 30 Arabs were detained for questioning, andsaid they suspected Palestinians were behind the attack.
