Leahy is sponsoring a computer crimebill that would stiffen the penalties for convicted computercriminals and distinguish between 'reckless' and 'intentional'crime.andP;  The pending bill would close purported loopholes in theComputer Fraud and Abuse Act.andP;  It would shift emphasis fromunauthorized access to computer systems over to issues of usingelectronic information to perpetrate crimes.andP;  The term 'access'would be explicitly extended to cover both entry into a system andtransmission of information.andP;  A national group, ComputerProfessionals for Social Responsibility, is also involved in thepublic debate on computer crime and is critical of the SecretService's Sun Devil operation, which reportedly was overzealous inprosecuting computer users.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Statute:   Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (interpretation andconstruction).andO;Topic:     United States.

Leahy fears law enforcement officials might think of 1991 asthe &quot;Year of Computer Crime&quot; and so be enticed to overstep theirjurisdictional boundaries, he said recently.andM;Although the Vermont Democrat fears the repercussions of emphasizing thenation's growing computer crime problem, he convened a hearing of his SenateJudiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law to discuss strengtheningfederal computer crime laws.andM;At the hearing Leahy warned high-level federal law enforcement officialstestifying on behalf of the Justice Department and the FBI against beingover-zealous in their pursuit of computer criminals.andM;&quot;I don't want to see the massive resources of the U.S.andP;  Justice Departmentturned loose on things that really don't matter that much,&quot; Leahy said.andM;Leahy and Sen.andP;  Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.) introduced a computer crime bill,S 2476, and said it should cose the loopholes in the existing Computer Fraudand Abuse Act (CFAA).andP;  The bill has not been scheduled for committee mark-up,but Leahy wants it to go to Senate floor before that end of the year, asubcommittee staff member said.andM;Recent actions by federal law agencies, including the Secret Service'sOperation Sun Devil, have caused Leahy concern, he said.andP;  Because of theincreased media and congressional interest shown computer crime, Leahy saidhe feared law officials inadvertently might sweep innocent people into theirnets because they want to respond aggressively to this problem.andM;Computer Professionals fo Social Responsibility, a national membershiporganization, agreed.andP;  Earlier this year, CPSR severely criticized the SecretService's Sun Devil investigation of computer hackers.andM;But Mark Rotenberg, director of CPSR Washington office, said his organizationsupports stiff penalties for people who is tentionally break laws usingcomputer CPSR also supports law enforcement agencies' rights to investigatesuspected computer crimes, he said.andP;  However, some agencies have shownmisplaced zeal, he said.andM;&quot;By raising concerns about Operation Sun Devil, we don't want to commendmischievous acts,&quot; Rotenberg said.andP;  &quot;But we also don't want to send out thewrong message.andM;Leahy said computer crime laws must find a delicate balance between judicialprotection and to technological innovation.andP;  Clean laws will help create acode of ethics among computer users, he said.andM;&quot;These are not the areas we learned in law school, and we're tying to searchout the best ways to deal with it,&quot; Leahy said.andM;Essentially, the pending bill attempts to shift the emphasis of the ComputerFraud and Abuse Act, which now focuses on unauthorized access.andP;  Thelegislation concentrates on the use of computers and electronic informationin perpetrating crimes.andM;It also seeks to clarify the term &quot;access&quot; used in the older law to coverboth entry into a computer system and the transmission of information.andP;  Thebill would expand the coverage of the CFAA to include not just &quot;federalinterest computers,&quot; which are defined broadly as government systems andother systems such as financial databases affecting large groups, but anycomputer used in interstate commerce or communications.andM;&quot;The computer abuse crimes covered by the CFAA are all limited by the conceptof 'unauthorized access' to certain categories of computer,&quot; Humphrey said.andO;&quot;But experience has taught us that some of the most far-reaching froms ofcomputer sabotage can be activated without gaining unauthorized access to theaffected computer systems.&quot;andM;Aslo, as several witnesses told the sub-committee, most computer crimes arecommitted by people authorized to use the systems.andM;Computer CrimesandM;Get New AttentionandM;To avoid excessive punishments get create a deterrent, the bill discriminatesbetween reckless and intentional behavior, Leahy said.andM;The reform bill would make reckless actions a misdemeanor, punishable by upto one year in prison and a $5,000 fine.andP;  Intentional actions would beconsidered felonies that could result in a $250,000 fine and a maximumfive-year prison sentence.andM;The existing law provides only for felonies and prison sentences of up tofive years.andM;With some minor exceptions, Justice official support the bill but feel itdoes not go far enough, said Mark M. Richard, deputy assistant attorneygeneral in charge of the Criminal Division.andM;&quot;We endorse the approach, but we think the approach should be expanded toother provisions that need modification,&quot; he said.andM;Humphrey countered by asking if some improvements were preferable to none.andO;Would Justice officials rather delay these changes until the entire bili canbe revamped? he asked.andM;&quot;If you say I can take only part of the apple, I'll take what I can get,&quot;Richard said.andP;  &quot;But if you say i can have the whole apple, I'd rather haveit.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
