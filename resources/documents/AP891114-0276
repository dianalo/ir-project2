(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Automakers and proponents of electricallypowered vehicles touted their wares Tuesday and predicted a futurewhen motorists will charge up rather than fill their tanks.   About 200 people, including representatives of two majorAmerican auto manufacturers, gathered to gawk at and driveprototypes of the first electric vehicles to be produced inconjuction with the American car industry.   One vehicle, the G-Van, which will be marketed by General MotorsCorp., is scheduled to begin production next year. Another vehicle,Chrysler's TEVan, is expected to be available in 1992 or 1993.   The conference was sponsored by the Electric Power ResearchInstitute, the research and development arm of the electric utilityindustry, which also helped developed the two vehicles.   From the outside, the electric vans look like theirpetroleum-powered counterparts and their proponents claim theyhandle like gasoline-powered vans as well. But instead of aconventional engine and gears, the electric vans operate on abattery-driven motor that can be recharged by plugging into anelectrical outlet.   ``We don't want to suggest this is going to turn aroundovernight, but we think it will provide an alternative,'' saidRichard E. Balzhiser, president of the Electric Power ResearchInstitute, which has been working on electrically powered vehiclessince 1979.   Despite progress, the driving range of the electric vehiclesremains limited when compared to conventional automobiles.   In the G-Van, for example, which is expected to sell initiallyfor about $32,500, the lead-acid battery will run for about 60miles without recharging. The TEVan, which has no suggested retailprice as yet, will use a nickel-iron battery and have a range ofabout 120 miles. Both batteries will take about eight hours torecharge, manufacturers said.   The top speed for the G-Van is about 52 miles per hour, whilethe TEVan will top off at about 65, the designers said.   Instead of the growl of conventional engines, the electric carproduces a low hum.   ``After the initial shock of the different noises, everything isbasically the same,'' said Dave Harris, of Chloride Ltd., one ofthe companies involved in manufacturing the G-Van. ``People get alittle bit thrown when they touch the gas pedal and they're waitingfor the engine to rev.''   Electric industry officials were ready with a laundry list ofreasons why Americans should push development of the vehicles.   Besides the fact that it would open a vast new market forelectric power, experts said electric vehicles would reduceemissions that threaten the environment with ozone and carbonmonoxide.   Replacing 1 million gasoline cars with electric cars would cutdown emissions by 150 million tons a year, said Balzhiser.   A car that runs without gasoline also could reduce the UnitedStates' dependence on foreign oil imports, since electricity can begenerated through several means, including hydro, coal and nuclearpower, said John E. Deegan, a senior vice president of ConsolidatedEdison Co. of New York.   Ken Winters, of Penstar Electronics, a Chrysler subsidiary,estimated electric vehicles would corner 10 to 20 percent of themarket for commercial vehicles by the second half of the 1990s.   Response to the cars from conference participants varied greatly.   ``The most promising stage of electric vehicles for commercialuse that I've seen in the 25 years I've been in the business isthis,'' said Victor Wouk, an electric vehicle consultant from NewYork. ``They seem to have solved the major problems that existed inthe past.''   But Mark A. Reedy of Wisconsin Electric said his utility had noimmediate plans to buy any.   ``We have some skepticism,'' he said. ``We've had some electricvehicles in our service areas before and they haven't reallyperformed adequately. We're just waiting to see how all this shakesitself out.''   Jerry Mader, president of the Electric Vehicle DevelopmentCorp., said he was optimistic about future sales.   He said the corporation has received orders for 185 electricvehicles since September, when it began soliciting business from600 utilities across the country.</TEXT></DOC>
