But he faces avery daunting task.''   Other officials still inside the Pentagon, who asked not to benamed, say it's possible for a congressman to jump into the hugemilitary bureaucracy and shine.   For example, one said, Melvin Laird did well in the Nixonadministration. And Cheney, who like Laird held a leadership postamong House Republicans, is no stranger to most of the big issues,the official added.   But Cheney is about to leap from running a Capitol Hill officewith relatively few employees to becoming the boss of 3.1 millionpeople. And he is doing so with little time to select key assistantsand aides.   The first important job he'll face is trimming the fiscal 1990budget. And he's never played that peculiar brand of Pentagonpolitics.   ``Dick Cheney is about to walk into this job right when it's timeto play referee among four services that are attacking each other inhopes of saving their own budget,'' said one official.   President Bush already has ordered the Pentagon to slash about$6.4 billion from its fiscal 1990 budget proposal ``and now it'sdog-eat-cat time,'' the source said.   Weinberger recalled such military budget fights, saying,``Everybody has recommendations of their own _ their own hopes andneeds _ and there's never enough for everybody. ... It will be very,very tough'' for Cheney.   To make matters worse, the congressman doesn't have the detailedmilitary-program knowledge possessed by Bush's first choice for thejob, John Tower.   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,was widely known for his exhaustive knowledge of such details. Hispersonal life, however _ including allegations of excessive drinkingand womanizing and his financial relationships with militarycontractors _ led to rejection of his nomination last week.   Cheney, by contrast, after being lauded for his honor andintegrity, was approved 20-0 Thursday by the Armed ServicesCommittee and is expected to clear the full Senate withoutopposition Friday.   One Pentagon official said anyone who sets his mind to it canlearn what weapons the nation depends on, how they work, how they'reproduced and how much they cost.   ``But that takes time, and Cheney doesn't have any,'' he said.   Tower knew the inside politics, the ``games between the servicesand program quirks,'' another source said.   As if setting budget priorities were not enough, Cheney also willhave only about a month to help Bush make broad decisions that willaffect national security for years to come.   For example, the administration must decide whether the UnitedStates needs a mobile nuclear missile to deter Soviet attack and, ifso, what type and how large it should be. The administration alsomust decide how fast it will attempt to build B-2 stealth bombers _a decision with huge financial implications.   Other pending decisions include how vigorously to develop a``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system, whether to continuesupporting a Navy built around 15 aircraft carriers, whethermilitary manpower should be cut, what goals to aim for innegotiating a nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union, and how towalk the tightrope of safeguarding Europe while negotiatingreductions to conventional arms.   ``He's going to have to do about 14 or 15 things at once,'' saysWeinberger, who was sworn in as secretary of defense just one dayafter Ronald Reagan began his presidency.   ``It's too bad he lost these months.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Norman Black has covered the Pentagon for TheAssociated Press since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
