John Cole, who is representing Tulsa, Okla.-based United VideoInc., said he had petitioned the U.S. Appeals Court for theDistrict of Columbia to stay the implementation of new syndicatedexclusivity, or syndex, rules, which opponents claim will causemassive headaches for cable operators and reduce the opportunitiesfor viewers to watch some of their favorite TV shows.   A three-judge panel of the court in October denied an earlierrequest for a stay, and then on Nov. 17 denied the overallchallenge to the rules. Cole said he was seeking a review by thepanel or by the full court on First Amendment grounds.   He claimed the panel's reasoning was ``unique in the annals ofthis court as well as the U.S. Supreme Court, and indeedcontradicts the consistent constitutional precedent of each.''   He claimed the rules, which the Federal CommunicationsCommission in 1988 decided to reimpose after an eight-year lapse,violate cable operators' First Amendment rights.   Officials for two other parties in the original challenge,Tribune Broadcasting and the Community Antenna TelevisionAssociation, said Friday they were admitting defeat and were notappealing.   United Video relays by satellite Chicago ``superstation'' WGN tocable television systems nationwide. Other TV stations also aredistributed to cable systems nationally or regionally.   In some cases that means a cable system may be showing itssubscribers ``Green Acres,'' for instance, from both the distantand local TV stations. The new rules would let the local stationsclaim exclusive rights to a syndicated program, therefore forcingcompanies like United Video or cable operators to black outportions of the distant signals.   Opponents say many cable systems, rather than incurring theexpense of blacking out programs, will drop the distant stationsentirely.   ``The subscribing public is the one that's going to get hurtmost on this,'' CATA President Stephen Effros said. He saw nochance for a successful appeal given the court's 3-0 vote on Nov.17.   Broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiencesand their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters lessincentive to develop syndicated programming.   The opponents claimed that the FCC does not have the authorityto impose the new rules under the 1976 Copyright and 1984 Cableacts, and that the rules violate cable's First Amendment rights.   But Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald said the cable companies were``claiming that they have a First Amendment right to expressthemselves using the copyrighted materials of others.''   Cole, however, said the court had cited no precedent forgovernment to ``restrict communicative transmissions, whatever thesubject matter, without minimally inviting the traditional scrutinyof the First Amendment.''</TEXT></DOC>
