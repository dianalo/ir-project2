Department of Energy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Agencies Can Think Small With Text Retrieval on PCsandM;When it comes to text retrieval software, some federal agencies are thinkingsmall and placing what once were typical mainframe applications onto PCs.andM;For example, several agencies, including the Energy Department and theFederal Bureau of Investigation, have used Zylab Corp.'s ZyIndex system tohost text retrieval applications on PCs.andM;The Arlington Heights, Ill., company's package is the base of a full-textindexing and retrieval system in an Energy Department document classificationapplication.andM;The application, called the Classification Guidance System, offers on-lineaccess to government regulations and reference manuals pertaining to nuclearenergy, said Anton &quot;Joe&quot; Sinisgalli, chief of the operations branch in theEnergy Department's Office of Classification and Technology Policy.andM;For this application the Energy Department has 35 ZyIndex systems across thecountry, each with a complete collection of classification guides on nuclearenergy, Sinisgalli said.andP;  There are more than 1,000 such guides.andM;&quot;According to the Atomic Energy Act, there are certain degrees ofclassification to all information about nuclear energy.andP;  These guides givethe rules or guidelines as to what should be released publicly and whatshould not,&quot; he said.andM;Sinisgalli noted the PC platform as one of ZyIndex's many benefits.andP;  &quot;ZyIndexmade the classification guides available on a PC without giving us theoverhead associated with a mainframe,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I don't think many people thought a PC system could handle this volume ofdata,&quot; said Tom Kurtis, a senior computer systems engineer with Computer DataSystems Inc. (CDSI) of Rockville, Md.andP;  CDSI is a computer support contractorproviding computer security and technology management services to the EnergyDepartment.andM;The Classification Guidance System uses IBM-compatible 286 machines with 640Kof RAM at minimum, Sinisgalli said.andM;Classified DataandM;&quot;We use the PC XT 286, a scaled-back PC AT-type of machine.andP;  We alsorecommend a 40M hard drive, and we use a removable cartridge because we'reworking with classified data,&quot; Kurtis said.andM;&quot;We use a portable hard drive for security purposes.andP;  The database is alwayschanging, and we have to be able to transfer it among our users and keep thedata secure,&quot; Sinisgalli said.andM;The ZyIndex package helps users search the content of documents acrossmultiple subdirectories and drives and supports more than 25 Different wordprocessing formats, company officials said.andM;Primarily, Energy's senior classification analysts use the system.andP;  Howeverthe department has about 4,000 classifiers that could use the system.andM;&quot;There were these 1,000 or so classification guides that existed in paperform.andP;  We took the text and put them into the ZyIndex system and indexedthem,&quot; Kurtis said.andM;The database takes up about 20M to 25M, he said.andM;The department has been using ZyIndex for about 18 months, according toSinisgalli.andP;  He said agency officials had evaluated eight or nine packages,but ZyIndex &quot;met our needs the closest.&quot;andM;&quot;The problem that the Energy Department's classifiers have, and that all ofus have, is the need to be able to go through large amounts of data to get tospecific information.andP;  This system has a lot of information, but ZyIndexallows people to very rapidly sift through the information,&quot; Kurtis said.andM;The average search time using the Classification Guidance System is a fewseconds, Sinisgalli said.andM;This application &quot;is on the large side,&quot; Kurtis said.andP;  Yet, while thedatabase is more than 20M, &quot;the indexed files take up 20 percent of that, andthe actual text files, the guides, take up 80 percent.&quot;andM;Kurtis said the Energy Department chose ZyIndex because of its speed andcapacity, and &quot;because it's very simple to use.&quot;andM;Sinisgalli agreed, saying the department had had a similar system, developedon a mainframe about nine years ago, &quot;that nobody liked to use because theuser interface was complex.andP;  ZyIndex has a friendly user interface,&quot; he said.andM;Documentation LaudedandM;In addition, Sinisgalli said the ZyIndex system has excellent documentation.andO;In fact, the department, using the ZyIndex documentation, created a usermanual in comic book form, customized to its application, he said.andM;The department also developed a bigger, loose-leaf manual using both Zylabmaterial and specific information for the agency's classifiers, he added.andM;&quot;This system is not necessarily on the cutting edge, but it's an applicationof computer technology that helps people do their jobs better.andP;  This systemprovides simplicity linked with power,&quot; Kurtis said.andP;  &quot;You don't have to be acomputer whiz to use the system.andP;  If someone can use a keyboard, we feel wecan get them up and running in about 15 minutes.&quot;andM;&quot;We have more installations in the government than any other retrievalvendor, and we lead in overall market share in the industry,&quot; said ScottWoodard, Zylab's president.andP;  The Delphi Consulting Group Inc. of Bostonconfirmed ZyIndex's leading market share for PC text retrieval products inits study titled, Text Retrieval Systems: A Market and Technology Assessment,published this year.andM;In addition to the Energy Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigationuses ZyIndex as a retrieval tool to help investigators with case management,company officials said.andP;  The FBI offers ZyIndex to about 6,000 PC users.andM;The Energy Department's Los Alamos Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., usesZylab's ZyIndex for Unix products.andM;Robin Young, of the Los Alamos Laboratory said she thinks the product &quot;opensthe way to manufacturing and searching large optical disks and CD-ROMs andallows us to access files more effectively.andP;  We plan on searching severalgigabytes of information,&quot; with the product.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
