Twenty-five years ago tomorrow, he signed a friendship treaty with West Germany designed to make the two nations the keystone of postwar Europe.    Now, faced with what seem to France to be the twin threats of U.S. withdrawal from Europe and a Soviet public relations blitz, Francois Mitterrand is also turning east. Tomorrow at the Elysee Palace, where the 1963 friendship treaty was signed, the French president and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will praise the quarter century of Franco-German cooperation, and sign accords for joint defense and economic councils and a joint military brigade.    But underneath the friendly rhetoric, the French, as they have been on and off for 400 years, are worried about their German neighbors. They worry most that Mikhail Gorbachev's charm and the Germans' desire for national unity will someday tempt Bonn out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They worry that German economic policies will continue to play to domestic concerns, not international responsibilities. They worry that Germans might one day find more cultural affinity with a reconstructed, German-speaking &quot;Middle Europe&quot; than they do with a French- or English-speaking West. They worry that a unified Germany would soon get out of control.    Even as the Elysee Treaty is being feted, some French are recalling the words of author Francois Mauriac: &quot;We like Germany so much we'd rather there were two of them.&quot;    Old problems are highlighted by new developments, such as the U.S.-U.S.S.R. treaty removing intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe, and how to respond to fresh Soviet disarmament initiatives. The French are disturbed by reports that some Bonn officials favor the removal of battlefield and other short-range nuclear weapons from Europe, which the French fear will lead to a total denuclearization of Europe, a pullout of U.S. troops, and pressure on France to give up its independent nuclear force.    &quot;West Germany is playing for the long term,&quot; says Pierre Lellouche of the French Institute for Foreign Relations. &quot;It believes it can get East Germany back without falling under Soviet domination itself.&quot; Mr. Lellouche and most other Frenchmen don't think this is possible.    &quot;There is a growing divergence between France and West Germany over German relations with the Soviet Union,&quot; says a French Foreign Ministry official who asks not to be identified. &quot;This is a fact, but a fact that is hidden under all these anniversary celebrations. The Germans are saying we must help Gorbachev. We are saying that we must be vigilant, and that the question of the West helping Gorbachev is unrealistic.&quot;    Adds another French official: &quot;If Franz Josef Strauss, the rightest of the German right-wingers, can come back from {a visit to} Russia a Gorbachev man, what are we supposed to think?&quot;    The French tend to worry so much because the stakes for them are so high. &quot;The French-German relationship is the foundation of the European pillar&quot; of the Western alliance, says former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. &quot;It is absolutely the core.&quot;    What the French want from the Germans are closer links, to firmly anchor West Germany to the West. A lot has been accomplished in the past 25 years. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing and former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, both former finance ministers of their countries, invented the European Monetary System in 1978, which links the franc, mark and six other European currencies. The two leaders met frequently and spoke on the telephone -- in English -- at least once every two weeks. &quot;The thing about it isn't the lip service, it's the work behind it,&quot; Mr. Giscard d'Estaing says of the relationship.    Much work remains to be done. French and German students still tend to learn English as their second languages, rather than each others' tongues. French and German television carry American or British detective series and sitcoms, not each other's. The French still envy West Germany as Europe's economic superpower, but now want Bonn to stimulate its economy -- and buy more French goods.    Some progress is being made. More French and German companies are forming alliances with an eye toward the removal of most intra-European trade barriers by 1992. This week, in an important symbolic gesture, the French government let Daimler-Benz AG buy 4% of Matra S.A., the French defense contractor that is being sold off by the state.    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur recently proposed a common European central bank and a common European currency, which would effectively institutionalize France and West Germany as the continent's joint economic powers. Bonn greeted the proposal with stony silence. But French Treasury officials speak privately of the distant day when the Bank of France and the Bundesbank simply merge -- and French and Germans spend the same currency in either country.    The Mitterrand-Kohl relationship has centered far more on defense cooperation than economic unity. The two leaders have tightened links between their respective defense and foreign-policy bureaucracies, and in addition to the proposed joint brigade, the French have set up a 40,000-man Rapid Action Force that would intervene quickly in Germany in the event of a Warsaw Pact tank attack.    But in France's view, at least, military cooperation is destined to remain more symbolic than real. All West German army troops are under NATO, not German command, because of World War II treaty restrictions, and France isn't a member of NATO's military wing. So the joint brigade will consist of far-from-crack recruits.    The Germans can only provide the equivalent of U.S. National Guard regiments; the French are keeping their own best troops for the French-controlled Rapid Action Force. And despite French contentions that such joint efforts represent a way around the NATO problem, officials say France doesn't intend to rejoin the alliance's military arm.    ---                     Comparative Strengths                               FRANCE          WEST GERMANY    Population                 55.4 million    60.8 million    GDP per capita             $10,243         $9,251    Annual defense spending    $26 billion     $25 billion    Annual defense spending      per capita               $468            $406    Armed forces               558,000         495,000    Battle tanks               1,339           4,887    Submarines                 16              24    Helicopters                675             700    Sources: OECD; Western European Union; German Defense Ministry</TEXT></DOC>
