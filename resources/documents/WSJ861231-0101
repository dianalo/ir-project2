Hazlett</HL><DD> 12/31/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP AFRICMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   The officiating of a contest sometimes mistakenly deemed the &quot;South African debate&quot; is suspect. Points and penalties are distributed in a moral bathing-suit competition in which the judges assign precious &quot;10s&quot; only to the most spotless geopolitical motive -- and their promenade must be flawless.    The latest to bare his anti-apartheid soul for our American panel of judges was a skilled contestant. Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labor Party and heir propellant to Mrs. Thatcher, paraded his moral muscularity to stateside admirers earlier this month in a multicity pageant.    Those who oppose punitive economic sanctions on South Africa, he determined, simply use &quot;an alibi for the appeasement of apartheid.&quot; Mr. Kinnock saw in anti-sanctions logic &quot;sweet reason with racism,&quot; and remained poised and charming to conclude: &quot;It is necessary to enforce strict measures that get to the very core of the relationship between apartheid South Africa and its economic trading partners overseas. For it is just that relationship which has enabled South Africa to sustain apartheid.&quot;    Sadly, Mr. Kinnock has every reason to know, and know well, what lays at &quot;the very core&quot; of South Africa's system. It was a shame, certainly, that he could not have been called upon by his hosts, among them Andrew Young, to explain the fascinating legacy of Labor Party complicity with the apartheid way of life.    While the Dutch cum Afrikaner may boast of a three-century stock in racist institutions, the recent (post-1948) development of &quot;separateness&quot; as the overarching public-policy mandate was fundamentally a reinforcement of a policy largely crafted by English-speaking South African Laborites in the &quot;Colour Bar&quot; legislation early in this century. The proximate cause of same was the competitiveness of black labor. After embarking on a series of strikes, white trade unionists crafted what was called the &quot;civilized labor policy&quot; to suppress the advance of lower-paid non-Europeans. In 1911, the first Colour Bar Act was instituted, over the opposition of industrialists (most notably the Chamber of Mines), which served to exclude nonwhite laborers from skilled crafts via occupational licensing and fixed white-black ratios in employment.    Labor peace was temporarily bought by the measure, and World War I soon lifted world demand for South African outputs, sending white incomes upward. But growth also had the temerity to suck hundreds of thousands of eager black workers into the industrial marketplace and, adding black insult to white injury, enabled many of them to accumulate both wages and human capital.    It was to create a political powder keg. For the wartime boom was soon to become a peacetime bust, and as the profit squeeze on capitalists intensified, the under-priced black worker looked handsomer than ever. In December 1921, the mine owners could no longer afford the &quot;status quo&quot; agreement signed with the white unionists in 1918, and announced the wholesale replacement of 2,000 semi-skilled white tradesmen by black Africans. On Jan. 10, 1922, the militant, all-white Mine Workers Union struck, and struck violently, quickly seizing control of the entire Rand gold-mining region. It was March before the Jan Smuts government could send 7,000 troops, aided by warplanes and heavy artillery, to restore order at a cost of some 200 lives. The MWU's marching slogan was a rather catchy tune: &quot;Workers of the world unite, and fight for a White South Africa.&quot; Lyrics by Marx, melody by Maddox.    But as the Smuts regime restored order in the Rand, it could not save itself in Parliament. In the 1924 elections it was swept from office in a white backlash excited by the Rand Rebellion. A Pact Government was formed, teaming the traditional race zealotry of the Afrikaner's National Party with the &quot;progressive&quot; economic agenda of the South African Labor Party. The latter group, explicitly socialist and modeled on Britain's Labor Party, quickly proposed the Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924, the Wage Act of 1925 and the Mines and Works Act of 1926 (called the Second Colour Bar Act). These and associated laws were to implement a &quot;cartelization of white laborers,&quot; as economist Mancur Olson puts it, threatened by &quot;unfair competition.&quot; As a white labor-union official told a Royal Commission in 1914, &quot;seeing that the average Kaffir {African} is bred as a slave, he has no right to usurp our position as free men to drive us from these mines.&quot;    Interestingly, economic protectionism quickly graduated into enforced social segregation. Indeed, long before the 1927 Immorality Act illegalized multiracial sex, MP Frederick Cresswell bragged that his Labor Party had shown leadership in the area of race separation-by-law with its advocacy of &quot;heavy penalties for co-habitation of whites with Kaffirs.&quot; The LP also opposed education and the vote for blacks, and actually helped the nationalists disenfranchise Cape Africans in the 1930s.    As it happened, the Laborites soon found that separatism could backfire, as an inferiority-complex ridden Afrikaner populace took out with a vengeance against English speakers generally. This, combined with the Afrikanerization of the white labor unions, led the Labor Party into political obscurity by the 1940s, but the Colour Bar agenda was enthusiastically expropriated by the Nationalists.    The plush economic standards of protected white workers had again been threatened by a postwar slump, and state-enforced racial exclusionism was the handy political response.    Foreign capitalists were not only not &quot;at the core&quot; of promoting apartheid institutions, the magnetism between them and the black working class was the primary evil to be expunged by apartheid. As the militant Afrikaner Broederbond was to pledge in its 1933 charter: &quot;Abolition of the exploitation by foreigners of {South Africa's} natural resources&quot; and &quot;the nationalization of finance and the planned coordination of economic policy.&quot;    Even in today's modernized neo-apartheid mutation, the trade-unionist flavor of white supremacy is crisp: The current general secretary of the MWU, Arrie Paulus, rose to power on a stalwart pledge to turn back &quot;the onslaught of Kaffir, Moor and Indian.&quot; His union struck the mines in 1979 specifically to resist black advancement, just as a potentially genuine progressive force, African trade unions, were being officially recognized by the government. As he now says: &quot;I make no apologies about it. We are trying to protect the interests of the white man in the country against the black.&quot;    In 1970 Norman Macrae noted in Harper's magazine that &quot;South Africa today is probably the only country where the big business community is visibly to the left of the government.&quot; Indeed, leading capitalists have repeatedly called for an end to racial domination, have opened a dialogue with black leaders, and have called for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela. Indeed, vocal business opposition to the pass laws in the 1960s prompted Prime Minister Verwoerd to denounce the associated chambers of commerce as &quot;traitors&quot; who were &quot;paving the way for black domination.&quot; Even the Institute for Policy Studies, not known for its Reagan administration ties, labels the liberal and anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party as the &quot;main political vehicle&quot; of industry and finance. What Mr. Kinnock is curiously silent about is the converse of Mr. Macrae's maxim: that South Africa uniquely offers a (white) trade-union movement well to the right of the government.    That this Mr. Kinnock may charm Western judges by tying South African apartheid to free trade is testimony to his fine nose for sniffing out a vintage promotional opportunity. Mrs. Thatcher, beware. But that the man may thereby be ogled by his American hosts as a principled foe of the forces of evil is testimony to the yawn that the facts of apartheid, as distinct from its drama, evoke in domestic idealists.    ---   Mr. Hazlett is an economist at the University of California at Davis.
