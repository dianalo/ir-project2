The workers are expected to return to their jobs as soon as they are officially notified of the law. It may take another 48 hours after they return to work to get the rail line operating again, Long Island Rail Road officials said.    The heavily traveled New York commuter railway has been immobilized by the walkout since Jan. 18, when 10 of 15 of the railroad's unions declined to ratify a proposed new contract.    The legislation, passed Tuesday by voice votes in the House and Senate, prohibits strikes or lockouts against the railroad through March 17. During this period, labor-management negotiations will continue, and if they fail, a three-member panel appointed by the National Mediation Board is to make its own proposal to Congress. If Congress were to reject the panel's finding, the strike could resume. </TEXT></DOC>
