The procession came a day after thousands of demonstratorsfought police with firebombs and rocks on the eighth anniversary ofthe bloodiest uprising in South Korea's history.   Thursday's march was in honor of Cho Sung-man, 24, who stabbedhimself in the stomach and jumped off an annex to MyongdongCathedral Sunday in an anti-government protest.   About 20,000 students and dissidents took part in the march,many of them carrying placards calling for an end to the governmentof President Roh Tae-woo and the expulsion of U.S. forces.   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Drive out theYankee imperialists,'' marchers chanted to the beat of drums.   Prayers were said at the spot in the cathedral compound whereCho died, and Roman Catholic priests led a ceremony outside thecathedral.   On Wednesday, fierce clashes broke out in the center of Seoulafter riot police hurling tear gas grenades broke up a studentmarch near City Hall. Students blocked streets around MyongdongCathedral and attacked riot police who tried to intervene.   Terrified pedestrians on their way home from work were caught inthe fighting. People trying to flee screamed with pain from the gas.   ``Down with the military dictatorship which committed theKwangju massacre!'' protesters yelled. ``Drive out the Roh murderregime!''   Roh was an army general when military force was used to quellthe 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju. At least 190people were killed.   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, reported Wednesday that astudent angered because a campus festival was going ahead on theKwangju anniversary set himself on fire in Chonan, about 31 milessouth of Seoul. The agency said he suffered serious burns.   There was also fighting in the provincial cities of Sunchon,Pusan, Chungju and Chongju following student rallies marking theKwangju anniversary.   Speakers in Seoul denounced the United States, claimingWashington had supported successive military regimes in SouthKorea. Students cheered as a crude, home-made American flag wasburned.   ``Yankee go home!'' protesters chanted. The United States has40,000 troops stationed in South Korea.   Waves of screaming students charged riot police units indowntown Seoul, hurling rocks, bricks and firebombs that explodedin plumes of blazing orange gasoline.   Protesters and police pelted each other with rocks and stonesripped from sidewalks as clashes continued into the night. Severalofficers and a press photographer were hit by firebombs thatignited their clothing.   Police reinforcements were rushed to the center of the city andlines of officers in green combat fatigues, black helmets and gasmasks swept along the streets as rifle squads fired volleys ofchoking tear gas.   The National Police, which mobilized 50,000 riot policenationwide, said about 43,000 students and protesters took part inanti-government demonstrations in 106 locations Wednesday.   Police declined to release any figures on injuries or arrests.   About 10,000 students attended a rally at Korea University ineastern Seoul. Students applauded speakers who demanded a fullinvestigation into the Kwungju uprising and urged Roh be ousted.   The anniversary was marked in Kwangju almost without incidentfor the first time since the uprising. Tens of thousands of peoplevisited the cemetery where many victims of the killings are buried.   Up to 50,000 people took part later in an anti-governmentprotest in the city. Police opened fire with tear gas launchers,but then announced over loudspeakers that they had made a mistakeand apologized. The rally finished without further incident.   At the time of the uprising, Chun was a general leading othermilitary officers who seized power after a coup. Most of them laterretired to take on political posts, and Chun became president. Thegovernment says 191 people were killed when troops ended theuprising, but dissidents claim more died.   Roh, who took power in February after winning election inDecember, has tried to defuse lingering bitterness over Kwangju.</TEXT></DOC>
