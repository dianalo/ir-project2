(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MIS BELT BEING PULLED TIGHTERandM;To be more competitive in the world trade market, large corporations arelooking for ways to cut costs and to be more productive.andM;Conglomerates are rapidly reducing their staffs.andP;  During the 1980s, thenumber of workers at Fortune 500 companies dropped by 3 million, even thoughrevenue at the nation's largest companies increased significantly.andM;In many instances, MIS departments helped corporations become moreproductive.andP;  By automating manual operations, firms were able to pareworkforces, yet maintain or even increase production of their wares.andM;MIS departments were rewarded for their efforts.andP;  As budgets in otherdepartments were drastically cut, MIS expenditures grew.andM;Currently, MIS costs represent the third highest expense at largecorporations.andP;  Spending on computers, software and network services trailsonly personnel and travel and entertainment at the top of the list.andM;Faced with the high cost of computers and software, company presidents andchief executive officers have begun examining MIS department productivity.andM;&quot;MIS managers are under tremendous pressure to document every cent that theyare spending,&quot; said Roger Craig, a product manager for CA-Unipac/PMA softwareat Computer Associates International Inc. (CA) in Garden City, N.Y.andM;For many MIS departments, growth in expenditures has slowed or stopped.andO;&quot;Dramatic increases in MIS budgets are not as common now as they were in theearly and mid-1980s,&quot; said Dr. Harold Schwenk Jr., president and CEO at BGSSystems Inc., Waltham, Mass.andM;The slowdown comes at a time when top executives are asking for more fromtheir MIS departments.andP;  &quot;Companies are looking to MIS to keep pace withcompetitors,&quot; said Schwenk.andP;  &quot;Corporations are attempting to buildapplications that were impossible 10 to 15 years ago.&quot;andM;Many of these applications are closely linked to corporations' businesses, soavailability requirements are becoming more stringent.andP;  &quot;Users expect theircomputers to operate like telephones: They should be available all the time,&quot;said Doug MacKinnon, an executive consultant at Candle Corp., Los Angeles.andM;The proliferation of microcomputers is also creating unrealisticexpectations.andP;  &quot;Users see subsecond response time from microcomputerapplications and expect mainframes to operate [similarly],&quot; said MacKinnon.andM;Even though executives are asking more from their MIS departments, they wantto spend less.andP;  &quot;We are seeing a growing number of MIS departments withbudgets of $20 million being asked to pare costs to $18 million,&quot; accordingto BGS' Schwenk.andM;MIS departments are being pitted against other important businessconstituents.andP;  Said Craig at Computer Associates, &quot;A company's president mayput off a mainframe purchase to dole out higher dividends to shareholders.&quot;andM;In some cases, new equipment is needed just to keep pace with growingapplications.andP;  &quot;If a company adds 1,000 users to its network, the MIS managermust increase the amount of mainframe resources just to meet guaranteedresponse-time requirements,&quot; said Michael Connolly, a senior manager atNolan, Norton andamp; Co., a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.andP;  &quot;But a chiefexecutive sees increased costs for the same level of service and is notpleased.&quot;andM;How can MIS managers balance conflicting requirements?andP;  &quot;MIS managers mustrecognize that they are running a business within their corporations andtreat their department accordingly,&quot; Craig suggested.andM;MIS managers must produce statistics to back up requests for additionalfunding.andP;  Most top executives take painstaking steps to measure items such asproductivity, but MIS departments rarely take these steps.andP;  &quot;MIS managershave never been good at quantifying their operations,&quot; Craig said.andM;TAKING THE FIRST STEPandM;Because they have not concentrated on this requirement, many managers mayhave difficulty taking a first step.andP;  &quot;It is very difficult to measureproductivity changes if one is not sure what should be measured,&quot; notedCharles Krueger, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin inMadison.andM;One place to start is with performance management and capacity planningtools.andP;  For more than a decade, software vendors have sold software thatmeasures system performance and outlines plans for future requirements.andM;As MIS managers come under more pressure to justify operating costs, thetools are becoming more popular.andP;  &quot;Interest in performance management toolshas increased dramatically in the past few years,&quot; said BGS' Schwenk.andM;By measuring productivity, MIS managers have ammunition when they ask foradditional expenditures.andP;  Productivity tools can determine the impact of datacenter consolidation.andM;During the past few years, many large enterprises have melded various datacenters.andP;  Consolidation is possible because vendors are delivering largermainframes and new software, such as IBM's Prism, which supports mainframepartitioning.andP;  Previously, customers could only run one operating system onan IBM mainframe.andM;Reduced operating costs is the primary reason for data center consolidation.andO;&quot;Systems programmers are hard to find,&quot; noted Schwenk.andP;  &quot;If a companycombines two data centers, it gets more bang for its programming bucks.&quot;andM;DEPARTMENT MERGERS MORE COMMONandM;During the past year, many corporations have eliminated some data centers.andO;U.S.andP;  West Inc., a telephone company in Denver, has embarked on an ambitiousprogram to pare its data center staff.andP;  The company expects to save more than$1 million per year by cutting the staff at an Albuquerque, N.M., datacenter.andP;  Manufacturer's Hanover Trust, a bank in New York, has melded sevendata centers into two sites; and ATandamp;T, Morristown, N.J., is in the process ofconsolidating 12 centers into five.andM;The moves are evident in almost every industry segment.andP;  During the pastyear, Ohio State University, Columbus, merged two IBM data centers.andP;  &quot;To moreefficiently use our personnel, we combined our operations staffs at twosites,&quot; said Daniel Cornelius, a systems programmer at the university.andM;But consolidation is not a cure-all and frequently entails hidden costs.andP;  Theprocess often costs more money than it saves.andM;For instance, Ohio State University is now pushing the processing power ofits mainframe to the limit and may be forced to purchase a new machine.andP;  Theprocessing constraints could have been used as an argument against theconsolidation.andM;In many cases, such issues crop up only after consolidation has beencompleted.andP;  In other instances, MIS managers find that a data center may nothave the room needed to house additional tape drives, modems or disk drives.andM;Consolidation can also hinder response time.andP;  Some companies may actuallylose money if response time degrades.andP;  If the line to an airline reservationsystem is busy, a travel agent may call another supplier and that business isgone forever.andM;A second way to cut MIS costs is to hand over operations to a systemsintegrator.andP;  These companies, which promise substantial savings, run all orpart of an MIS department.andP;  Last year, Muerrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp;Smith in New York handed over much of its MIS operation.andP;  The market forthese services is growing so fast that IBM has begun actively pursuingoutsourcing contracts.andM;Outsourcing is becoming a common issue for many MIS managers.andP;  &quot;I visitedthree data centers in Texas last week, and each was considering itsoutsourcing options,&quot; said Craig at Computer Associates.andM;Outsourcing suppliers do not always play fair Systems integration executivesboast that they often circumvent MIS departments and bring outsourcing issuesdirectly to top company executives.andM;Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester, N.Y., has been a leader in outsourcing itsMIS functions.andP;  Observers claim that the notion actually came from ElectronicData Systems Corp., a systems integrator in Dallas.andP;  EDS told top managersthat Kodak's MIS costs were above industry averages, and claimed that EDScould dramatically cut costs.andM;Ironically, EDS did not win any of Kodak's four outsourcing contracts, whichwere awarded in the past two years.andM;Kodak contracted IBM to manage its data center operations, which were to beconsolidated from four operations to one.andP;  Kodak's telecommunicationsoperation will be outsourced to Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.andP;  AndBusinessLand will be handling the company's personal computer procurement andmaintenance.andM;Despite the growing number of outsourcing deals, many MIS managers thinktheir operations are secure.andP;  &quot;Many MIS managers think outsourcing will neveroccur at their companies,&quot; said MacKinnon at Candle.andP;  &quot;In some instances,they are shocked to find that is not true.&quot;andM;Some managers view outsourcing as a threat to their jobs.andP;  &quot;Whenever I beginto talk about outsourcing, many MIS managers simply get up and walk out ofthe room,&quot; noted Connolly at Nolan, Norton andamp; Co.andM;For instance, Doug McMahan, the systems and programming manager at MartinSprocket and Gear Inc. in Arlington, Tex., said that his company will neverexamine outsourcing.andP;  &quot;Our firm is a privately held company, so it is not asbottom-line-oriented as many public companies,&quot; he said.andP;  Martin Sprocket andGear operates an IBM System/38 and IBM AS/400 computers, which supportapproximately 250 users.andM;A few industry experts think that the current hullabaloo about outsourcing isoverrated.andP;  &quot;There has always been a segment of companies that handed overtheir MIS operations to systems integrators,&quot; said BGS' Schwenk.andP;  &quot;But thenumber of companies in that segment is not growing dramatically.&quot;andM;MANAGERS MUST BE AGGRESSIVEandM;Other industry observers recommend that MIS managers take an aggressiveposture in battling outsourcing alternatives.andP;  &quot;MIS managers should bring theissue up rather than wait for their bosses to talk about it,&quot; said Craig.andM;To be proactive, managers must measure their own performance by documentingtheir departments' productivity and staff requirements.andP;  This task may makesome managers uneasy because MIS productivity has leveled off in the past fewyears, according to Connolly.andP;  &quot;We are seeing only modest increases in MISdepartment productivity.&quot;andM;Using a pool of 200 companies, Connolly has monitored various indicators ofMIS department productivity for years.andP;  He found only minimal increases inthe effective use of mainframes.andM;For example, use of available CPU cycles has shown slight improvement.andP;  Primeshift utilization of CPU cycles has grown from 58% in 1987/88 to 61% during1989/90.andP;  Overall utilization of mainframe processing capabilities rose from42% to 45% in the same period.andM;Rapid industry progress has contributed to the slowdown.andP;  &quot;In the past fewyears, MIS departments automated many data center functions,&quot; said Connolly.andO;&quot;Software now supports remote printing and remote operation.andP;  Various consolemessages are automatically suppressed.andP;  So, there are not many functions leftthat can be easily automated.&quot;andM;Message suppression is one reason for the move to consolidate data centers.andO;This technique displays only items that require human intervention, such as&quot;Insufficient memory to process CICS Apps.&quot;andP;  If the mainframe executesproperly, the operator receives no messages.andM;&quot;Operators do not have to sit and watch messages on their screens todetermine if the system is operating properly,&quot; said Jon Henderson, a productline manager at Goal Systems International Inc., a software firm in Columbus,Ohio.andP;  &quot;They can now do more productive things with their time.&quot;andM;Productivity gains can also come from squeezing more cycles out of existingsystems.andP;  For example, Amsouth Bank of Birmingham, Ala., reduced theprocessing time required for its asset management applications by 50% afteridentifying a bottleneck in the software.andP;  Using the Strobe tool fromProgramart, Cambridge, Mass., Amsouth learned that most of the CPU processingtime consumed by asset management packages was for input/output operations.andO;Strobe analyzes the computer resource use of application software.andM;&quot;We saw that 95% of all our wait time was associated with Vsam I/O,&quot; saidClarence Golson, technical support manager at the bank.andP;  To address thatissue, Amsouth used the Iam package from Innovation Data Processing, Clifton,N.J., to replace the Vsam I/O.andP;  &quot;We 'restrobed' each job and were able todocument a runtime reduction of 50%,&quot; said Golson.andM;GETTING USERS INVOLVEDandM;MIS management must make company management aware of this kind of successstory.andP;  To do that, MIS must enlist the help of users.andP;  &quot;MIS has to get usersmore involved in decisions, such as setting service-level requirements,&quot;explained Krueger at the University of Wisconsin.andM;Most MIS departments have set loose service-level objectives for their users.andO;&quot;If users aren't complaining about poor response time, then MIS managers seeno reason to outline formal service-level agreements,&quot; said MacKinnon atCandle.andM;But the agreements can function as a marketing tool.andP;  For instance, at theUniversity of Wisconsin, the Computer Services' central Florida regionalcenter in Tampa established formal service-level agreements four years ago.andM;&quot;We review the agreement at least once a year to make sure our usersunderstand our response-time objectives,&quot; said J.R.andP;  Clark, a capacityplanner at the university's Computing Services center.andM;The process can help resolve disputes.andP;  &quot;If disagreements arise, the MISmanager and the user can go back to written documents,&quot; said Krueger.andM;Interest in formal service-level agreements is on the rise.andP;  &quot;MIS departmentsare setting formal guidelines for items, such as response time, outputdelivery time and the number of batch jobs that execute in 60 minutes orless,&quot; said Henderson at Goal Systems.andM;To forge additional agreements, MIS managers need better software.andP;  Currenttools have limitations, such as little integration between variousperformance monitoring programs.andM;&quot;New applications are becoming quite complex,&quot; said MacKinnon at Candle.andP;  &quot;Auser often pulls information from a variety of places on a mainframe.andO;Current tools do a poor job of measuring the processing time needed toperform these tasks.&quot;andM;Most performance monitoring programs monitor a specific piece of mainframesoftware.andP;  For instance, a program will measure the time that IBM's DB2relational database management system takes to complete a transaction.andP;  Thesoftware will not determine the time needed to import information from a CICSapplication to DB2.andM;The constraint often frustrates users.andP;  &quot;Measuring end-to-end performance isa problem,&quot; said Craig at Computer Associates.andP;  &quot;A network operator will sitat a terminal and tell a user that all network equipment is functioning.andO;Then, the frustrated user will ask, 'Why have I stared at the same terminalfor five minutes?'&quot;andM;To provide better answers, MIS managers need a central place to storeapplication information.andP;  Product lines, such as IBM's AD/Cycle, are designedto address that issue.andM;But such software is immature.andP;  For instance, the AD/Cycle's centralrepository, Repository Manager/MVS, began shipping in June.andP;  IBM is only justbeginning to outline plans for a comprehensive systems management plan, akinto AD/Cycle, that includes performance management.andP;  Observers estimate thatcomprehensive solutions are at best a few years and at worst a dozen yearsfrom completion.andM;Once available, the tools are expected to be expensive.andP;  &quot;We have stayed awayfrom many performance and planning tools because they are expensive topurchase and costly to maintain,&quot; said McMahan at Martin Sprocket and Gear.andM;In addition, the tools add overhead to computers and networks.andP;  Krueger said,&quot;There is always a fine line between productivity increases and increasedspending.andP;  No one is sure where that is.&quot;andM;Faced with data center consolidation and outsourcing alternatives, MISmanagers want to err on the side of too much measurement.andP;  Documenting theirperformance may be the key to job security.andM;Korzeniowski is a freelance writer based in Malden, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
