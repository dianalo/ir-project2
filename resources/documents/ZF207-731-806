Bit by Bit, COMPUTER LANGUAGE, Sept.andO;1989, pp.andP;  141-150).andP;  I indicated that the arena traditionally associatedwith ergonomics, namely the physical and environmental design factorsaffecting user-machine interaction, had broadened considerably with theadvent of general-purpose computing systems.andP;  Aspects of ergonomics thatinvolve (or rather, should involve) software developers are rapidly coheringinto a distinct discipline, graced by its own national and internationalsocieties, journals, jargon, acronyms, ACM special interest group (thefast-growing SIGCHI), and--the sure sign of a serious field ofdiscourse--several disputatious standards committees.andM;Apart from all the obvious human engineering problems in designing keyboards(the IBM PC Jr.andP;  springs to mind) and display units (the screens on board theAegis, for instance), new ergonomic challenges are emerging for theprogramming community, especially with the growth of personal computing bycasual users.andP;  The latter come in all shades of prejudice, fromcomputerphobia to great expectations, but must generally be considered ashaving no instrinsic enthusiasm for the slew of hidden drain pipes that guidethe garbage-in to the garbage-out.andM;Protecting users from irrelevant bits and bytes, however, must not beconfused with isolating users from the computer as a problem-solving tool.andO;Trying to make a new tool look and feel like an antiquated tool is not theway forward.andP;  A screen is not a desk, a disk file is not a manila folder,and, just to make a song of it, a house is not a home.andP;  As with candle-shapedelectric lamps, log-shaped electric fires, and horseless carriages, the useris not fooled for long.andP;  In fact, a phony metaphor can be counter-productivein the long term, even if the initial encounter suggests familiarity and userfriendliness.andM;I make a notable exception with an icon on the NeXT interface builder.andP;  It'sa huge, grotesquely realistic double-pole, two-way switch, straight fromFrankenstein's laboratory.andP;  When you click on the handle, the switch clunksover before your very eyes and flips you between build and command modes.andO;You can feel the life force sizzling through the reviving monster.andP;  Now thatis an acceptable metaphor for a toggle.andM;In an uncharacteristic burst of aphoristic anemia last month, I offered thesingle golden rule, &quot;The user comes first.&quot;andP;  As with all such swithyproclamations (the portmanteau &quot;swithy&quot; usefully combines &quot;sweeping&quot; with&quot;pithy&quot;), more questions are begged than answered.andP;  One of my pettier peevesis that least helpful of all mnemonics: KISS.andP;  Robin Pasley wrote recently,&quot;The old KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) rule makes sense.andP;  Complexity justcreates problems.&quot; [1]andM;Unfortunately, most real-world data-processing problems, including many thatcan be stated in a few simple sentences (&quot;Keep these three lathes gainfullyoccupied,&quot; or &quot;Get those salespeople on the road&quot;) are provably complex,often to the extreme of noncomputability.andP;  Complex solutions are the result,not the cause, of such problems.andP;  In a relational database management systemcontext, try shouting KISS to Codd!andM;Returning to the user interface, may I clarify some misconceptions?andP;  Someusers think that if you want windows, mice, and fancy pop-up menus, you musthave a graphical user interface.andP;  Running the Microsoft QuickC integrateddevelopment environment on any text-only, monochrome display adapter willprovide an immediate rebuttal.andP;  You can even generate passable icons in textmode.andP;  I am not knocking the graphical user interface or extolling textmodes, but simply correcting some existing bias.andP;  If you want a richconfusion (sorry, profusion) of icons, fonts, and exploding pie charts, andhave the spare CPU cycles and RAM to support you habit, a graphical interfaceis your only fix.andP;  The other misconception is that this interface aloneautomatically lets the user switch among applications with no extra training.andO;In Design Management, David McGee wrote:andM;The familiar DOS prompt will soon be outdated.andP;  Instead, users can choosefunctions from a graphical menu via a mouse....andP;  Users who know PresentationManager have already mastered the basics of the applications that operatewith software written to the interface....andP;  With a product such asPresentation Manager, a user does not have to memorize a host of operationalcommands to use a program because the interface has stripped away a wholelayer of computer literacy.andP;  [2]andM;What is overlooked is that any consistent interface, graphical or otherwise,confers a certain advantage when hopping about different applications.andP;  Weshould not exaggerate this advantage.andP;  The semantics of differentapplications are (presumably) different, even if they share similaroperational features, such as Load, Run, and Quit.andP;  The implication thatgraphical interfaces ease the memory burden is also misleading.andP;  A crypticcommand-line syntax is not the only alternative.andP;  Text-based menus can bemouse-or keyboard-selected in new and intriguing ways.andM;A recent bout of serendipity revealed how existing text-based applicationscan quickly acquire some of the claimed graphic glitter without the overheadof Windows or Presentation Manager.andP;  When ordering my 386 system fromRobotics Concepts in San Leandro, Calif., I asked, almost as anafter-thought, for a mouse to be fitted.andP;  The new rodent in my life turns outto be a three-button Logitech bus-mouse from the folks who brought Modula-2to our PCs.andP;  Our two cats, Sieglinde (a.k.a.andP;  Siggy) and Legume (a.k.a.andO;Leggy), were not impressed.andP;  Mousetalk now includes the word &quot;chord,&quot; meaningthat you can generate seven distinct signals by pressing any set of buttonssimultaneously, avoiding arpeggios.andP;  The mouse comes with four manuals andlots of what Logitech calls MouseWare.andP;  This is not the traditionalchurchmouse deal offering MOUSE.COM and a leaflet on how to change yourCONFIG.SYS.andP;  Yes, I know Microsoft also has a mouse that roars with similarsoftware, but can you chord with two measly buttons?andM;The neat thing is that the Logitech mouse works not only with applicationswritten for mice but with ordinary, nonmouse, keyboard-based applications.andO;The latter can be &quot;mousified&quot; (yet more mousetalk) using the LogiMenusoftware supplied.andP;  You write an ASCII definition file with the same name asthe application but with the extension .DEF.andP;  Listing 1 shows WS.DEF forWordStar.andP;  Logitech supplies .DEF files for most of the leading packages.andO;You can edit these using the reasonably self-evident LogiMenu syntax.andP;  Youthen compile *.DEF using NEWMENU, to give you *.MNU.andP;  You can either load theWS.MNU into RAM with the command LOGIMENU WS or use the CLICK system.andM;CLICK.EXE is a terminate-and-stay-resident program that manages the loadingand unloading of .MNU files.andP;  With CLICK in place, simply invoking WordStarwith the usual WS command will load WS.MNU for you.andP;  CLick can manage up to50 applications.andP;  Again, you can edit CLICK.SRC (Listing 2) and compile it toCLICK.EXE using NEWCLICK.andP;  Alternatively, CLICKADD.COM lets you add anapplication at any time to update CLICK.EXE in RAM.andM;The syntax for the single-column, pull-down menus (Menu keyword) and moregeneral free-format, pop-up menus (Pop-p keyword) is shown in Listing 3.andP;  TheLogiMenu language is simple but effective.andP;  Note the MATCH statement allowingmany context-sensitive tricks:andM;MATCH Row, Col, &quot;string&quot;, MatchLabel, MisMatchLabelandM;If a particular application screen or mode displays some revealing clue in apredetermined position (a common situation, as shown in WS.DEF), you can testfor a MATCH and branch accordingly.andP;  I can only give you the flavor ofLogitech's MouseWare suite.andP;  A comprehensive pop-up DOS shell is alsoprovided that can protect beginners from command-line tyranny and render theDOS prompt obsolete without the expense of OS/2 and Presentation Manager.andM;Other goodies include program control over mouse movement, sensitivity, anddynamics.andP;  A ballistic control adjusts cursor sensitivity as you approachyour target.andM;The interesting question is deciding where these customized mousificationsfit into the general user-interface debate.andP;  The shells provided by Logitechfor Lotus 1-2-3, for example, are complete and immediately usable by thenonprogrammer.andP;  But can the average casual user be expected to master eventhe simple LogiMenu customizing software?andM;Bob Fowler's date algorithms in &quot;The dating game&quot; (Bit by Bit, COMPUTERLANGUAGE, July 1989, pp.andP;  105-109) attacted some enlightening correspondencefrom John Kennedy and Irving Sperling.andP;  Next month I will review theircorrections with Fowler's comments.andP;
