Late yesterday, federal Judge Morris E. Lasker said in open court that a note from the jury indicated they were still working on only one of the 27 questions the jurors were instructed to answer in coming to a decision. That question, which concerns damages, would be reached by the jury only if it first found the Hunts liable on at least one of Minpeco S.A.'s claims.    Minpeco alleged the three Hunt brothers and others concocted a scheme to corner the 1979-80 world silver market. In its $150.6 million suit, government-owned Minpeco contended the Hunts and others committed fraud and violated commodity and antitrust laws as well as federal racketeering laws.    Because this is a civil case, the company only has to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence rather than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; as in criminal cases.    The jury began its deliberations Monday, after a trial that lasted nearly six months.    Minpeco's attorneys attempted to prove, through circumstantial evidence, that the Hunt brothers, two Arab sheiks, a Lebanese businessman and a brother-in-law of the Saudi Arabian crown prince conspired to hoard silver bullion. The lawyers also tried to show that the alleged conspiracy was responsible for moving the price of silver to an unprecedented high of $52 an ounce on Jan. 21, 1980. By March 27, the price had plummeted to $10 an ounce.    A jury verdict against the Hunts on either antitrust or racketeering charges could mean triple damages under federal law. Minpeco has already received $64.7 million in pre-trial settlements from six other defendants in the same case, and this sum would be deducted from any damages assessed by the jury.    A verdict against the Hunts would have a ripple effect in their other legal proceedings. Judge Lasker, who has presided over the trial in federal court here, also has before him two large class-action suits against the Hunts on behalf of about 17,000 investors, many of whom had short positions in the silver market in 1979. There are also numerous individual suits claiming losses because of the alleged price manipulation. Action in these suits has been suspended pending the outcome of the Minpeco case, which was the first against the Hunts to reach a jury.    Also in limbo has been an administrative proceeding against the Hunts initiated in February 1985 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington.    Depending on the extent of the damages, a negative verdict could put more financial pressure on the brothers' struggles to hold on to the remnants of their empire, once one of the U.S.'s greatest fortunes. The brothers owe a group of banks an estimated $1.6 billion, some of which traces back to the original bailout loan for the silver debacle. In 1980, to cover losses on March 27, known as Silver Thursday, the Hunts took out a $1.1 billion loan.    In 1986, battered by misfortunes in silver and oil investments, the William Herbert Hunt trust estate sought protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; the Nelson Bunker Hunt and Lamar Hunt trust estates followed in 1987. Under Chapter 11, a company operates under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.    Through the trusts, the brothers control Penrod Drilling Co., which owns one of the world's largest offshore drilling fleets. Last month, the brothers filed a reorganization plan in federal bankruptcy court to settle $760 million in Penrod debts and to allow the trusts to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.    Placid Oil Co., long considered the jewel of the Hunt empire, has also been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings since 1986. Also last month, to settle a two-year battle with its banks, Placid Oil liquidated or mortgaged lucrative assets to the point where it forecast a &quot;relatively tight&quot; cash position for several years. As a result, if oil prices don't rise soon, there may be additional asset sales such as real estate and energy leases.    A bankruptcy filing in late July showed for the first time the degree to which the Hunts have had to sell off portions of the flagship company just to keep it afloat. </TEXT></DOC>
