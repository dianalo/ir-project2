News of the job action at the Chuquicamata open-pit minein the northern Atacama desert sent copper prices soaring totheir highest level in seven weeks in international metalsmarkets.   The stoppage is the first at Chuquicamata since themilitary seized power in Chile in 1973 and banned strikes atthe mine. The mine accounts for almost half of Chile's copperoutput-last year, it produced 667,000 metric tons-andgenerates 13% of its foreign revenue.   State-owned Chile Copper Corp., the world's biggestproducer, rejected union pay demands because of rapidlyrising costs and falling output at the mine. &quot;The strike willseriously damage the country's image as a stable democracyand a model economy in Latin America,&quot; Chile's financeminister said.                                                                                                          ITALY'S FOREIGN-CURRENCY DEBT                                                                                                          Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded Italy'sforeign-currency debt, citing Italian policy makers' slowresponses to economic changes in the past few years. Therating concern lowered to double-A-1 from triple-A about$22.2 billion of long-term debt issued in other currencies.Moody's said that in the European Community integration,Italy has become open to capital flows. The opening of theeconomy and lower household savings have constrained thestate's access to usually captive sources of finance. It saidItaly's debt-service capacity is bound to face strains, givenlarge public deficits and high interest rates. Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. plans no rating change.                                                                                                          INDIA'S RUPEE IS DEVALUED . . .                                                                                                          India's central bank said it devalued the rupee 9.5%against the dollar. New Delhi called the move routine, butbankers and industrialists viewed it as a step to satisfy theInternational Monetary Fund. India is said to be seeking $7billion in loans and financing from the IMF and World Bankfor development projects. The devaluation came as India's newgovernment faced a foreign-currency crisis. The treasury hasonly enough hard cash to pay for less than one month'simports.                                                                                                          . . . AND PERU HAS NEW TENDER                                                                                                          Peru introduced a new currency, the second in six years,though it said the nuevo sol, which replaces theinflation-ridden inti, won't start circulating until at leastOctober. The government estimated it wouldn't be able tocover the cost of launching the currency for several months.The inti will be valid until it is exchanged. The nuevo sol,now valued at $1.20, equals one million intis. Prior to thechange, the dollar bought 840,000 intis on the black market.                                                                                                          EASTERN GERMANY'S JOBS OUTLOOK                                                                                                          Unemployment in the five eastern German states could peakat almost 46% next year under a catastrophic scenario by theVienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies. A secondscenario, which assumes a moderate shock to the economy,predicts a jobless peak of slightly more than 36%. Bothassume a slump in productivity this year and relatively rapidgains from 1993.                                                                                                          SOCIAL COST OF ECONOMIC CHANGE                                                                                                          The high social cost of economic reforms in Eastern Europecould undermine democratic change, the United NationsChildren's Fund warned in Geneva.   &quot;Unless social needs are met, political unrest andpressure for migration to the West could increase,&quot; Unicefsaid, unveiling a study showing a significant drop instandards of living in Eastern European countries sincecommunism collapsed. In moves toward a market economy, theagency said, vulnerable groups such as mothers and childrenneed to be protected.   The report said that in Poland, incomes dropped 25% lastyear and most families spent half of their salaries on food.A recent opinion poll showed that 43% of Poles believed theyhad lived better under socialism. In a survey in Hungary,people complained that they spent 80% of their incomes onfood and housing.   The Unicef study showed that minimum wage levels inEastern Europe are a fraction of what they had been in termsof purchasing power.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The first Luxembourg bank workers' strike in memory causedlittle if any disturbance to the financial sector.
