Inc.'s HowardSorgen, director of information processing and technical services at the NewYork City-based financial giant.andP;  Adds the 31-year is veteran: &quot;Vendors areworking so much harder, they are earning the business.andM;Underneath the surface, however, executives who manage the companiesproviding is solutions see a darker, more treacherous side to thebusiness-one fraught with change.andP;  The very things that dazzle the public anddelight big users like Merrill Lynch-standards, 12-month product cycles,mainframe power on a desk, global connectivity, etc.-cause heartburn inArmonk, Paris, Tokyo and the headquarters of countless other is suppliers.andM;Satisfying customers weaned on the 1980s' promise of more, more, more forless, less, less is taking its toll.andP;  And it may be even more painful as thepace of change in the industry accelerates throughout the 1990S.andM;A Lackluster Financial PerformanceandM;The price exacted by achieving customer satisfaction is evident on the topline and the bottom line of the collective financial results posted by theworld's top suppliers that constitute the DATAMATION 100.andP;  Is revenues forthese companies grew just 5.2% in 1989, which is less than one-third of thegrowth rate of the last two years.andP;  Clearly, a number of companies weren'tdelivering as many new solutions as they needed to satisfy users or to keepup with rivals.andP;  Witness the decline in virtually flat growth at Unisys Corp.andO;and NCR Corp. over the last two years.andM;Those suppliers that shipped hardware and software components of theclient/server model of distributed computing-or serviced it by way ofnet-working or systems integration-had no trouble growing in 1989.andP;  Forexample, Sun Microsystems Inc. increased its sales 40% to $2.1 billion bysolving users&quot; needs for high-performance networked computing based onreduced instruction set computing (RISC) and industry standard (UNIX)software.andP;  Bull added more than  1 billion to its is revenues, which reached$6.5 billion, by acquiring Zenith Data Systems Corp., whose MS-DOS, os/2 andUNIX desktop systems and portable computers fit the model.andP;  The networkingarm of japan's giant communications monopoly, Nippon Telegraph and TelephoneCorp. (NTT), expanded its business 32% to  2.3 billion on the strength of itsability to integrate superservers, new technologies and standards.andM;Overshadowing such positive results, however, was the negative financialperformance of several of the industry's leaders in 1989.andP;  Although earningsdisappointments are de rigueur in information technology, the litany ofcompanies reporting disappointing results in net income for 1989 reads like aWho's Who of the business: IBM-down 35%; Digital Equipment Corp.-down 28%;Amdahl Corp.-down 30%; etc.andP;  Even in Europe, where demand for is is runningat peak levels, Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA suffered a 43% decline inearnings to L202.8 billion ($147.3 million).andP;  Only the highly diversifiedjapanese suppliers reported consistently good profit performance.andM;Where did the profits go? In part, they went into restructuring costs andstock buy-backs, which totaled some  5 billion among U.S.andP;  companies.andP;  IBMtopped everyone in this regard, taking a  2.3 billion charge against itsfourth-quarter 1989 earnings to cover the cost of plant closings and earlyretirements.andM;But, mainly, profits just disappeared into operating margins, the differencebetween what it costs a supplier to create a product or service and what thatproduct or service sells for.andP;  The systems that are spurring industry growthtoday-personal computers and workstations-command lower margins than othertechnologies.andP;  Although the economics of distributed systems was known tosupplier executives for some time, the pace of this economic revolution caughmost off guard.andP;  &quot;The speed of the shift surprised us,&quot; admits James A.andO;Unruh, who has taken over for Michael Blumenthal as chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Unisys Corp. How surprised was the Blue Bell, Pa.-basedcompany? It lost 1639 million in 1989, despite realizing IS sales of nearly$9.4 billion.andM;The margin squeeze affects even those suppliers that figured out early onthat users were going to demand standards-based distributed-computingplatforms in the 1990s.andP;  Hewlett-Packard Co., despite growing its is revenues24% to $7.8 billion in 1989, didn't make as much money on its systems as ithad in previous years.andP;  Gross margins for the Palo Alto computer makerdropped from 52.2% in 1987 to 48.8% in 1989.andP;  They'll sink even further inthe future to 46.1%, estimates Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., an investmentresearch and management firm in New York City.andM;Even if traditional minicomputer suppliers like HP are able to adjust tosomewhat lower profit margins, it's unclear just how far they can go tocompete against companies that do nothing  ut offer standards-based solutionson desktop platforms.andP;  &quot;We are profitable on 30% gross margins,&quot; points outThomas Yuen, cochairman of AST Research Inc., the $482 million Pc maker inIrvine, Calif.andP;  &quot;While it may be technically feasible for minicomputermanufacturers to move their products downward, financially it will bedifficult for them to do so.&quot; He cites Digital as an example.andP;  If the world'sNo.andP;  2 computer maker tried to realize one-fourth of its revenues fromservicing PCs as it does today in minicomputers, Yuen says, Digital would beout of business.andP;  &quot;Old habits are hard to break,&quot; Yuen says of theminicomputer companies' plight.andM;Wall Street Winds DownandM;As if adapting to the new economics of distributed computing weren't enoughof a challenge for suppliers, they must also cope with flat U.S.andP;  demand fornew systems and services.andM;Divining the reasons for the slowdown in U.S.andP;  spending on is is a topic ofconversation at virtually every industry gathering.andP;  To some, it's due toundersupply of critical technology (See &quot;What's Right with the U.S.andP;  Market,&quot;p. 38.) To others, it's a natural consequence of a market that has just runout of gas after accelerating 15% annually in the late 1970s and early 1980s.andO;U.S.andP;  spending on high technology (everything from computers to copiers)peaked in 1985 as a percentage of capital spending and will continue to be asmaller share of the overall capital investment, maintains Stephen S. Roach,chief economist at the Big Apple investment house Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc.andM;One of the big culprits in the spending slowdown is the financial servicesindustry.andP;  Investment banks, commercial banks, savings and loan institutions,insurance companies and real estate enterprises displayed an almostinsatiable appetite for is during the bull market of the 1980s.andP;  But thestock market crash of 1987, the fall in real-estate values (and hencemortgage loans) in the Southwest and Northeast, natural disasters and otherevents have sharply curbed Wall Street's and Main Street's hunger forcomputers.andP;  In fact, many are consolidating-not expanding-their isoperations.andP;  Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Inc. is a case in point; the firm isreducing the number of its data centers from seven to two.andM;Merrill Lynch and other big is customers are demanding that suppliers reduceor at least govern the total cost of using information systems-not just thehardware component.andP;  Operations support, the cost of real estate andfacilities, salaries for programmers maintaining old programming code-all ofthat is rising, not declining.andP;  Until suppliers help cut those costs, salesof hardware to U.S.andP;  sites will remain depressed.andP;  &quot;The market is responsiveto total solution price/performance,&quot; says Don Young, a securities analystfor Bernstein.andP;  &quot;Mainframe Is staffs are developing, supporting and operatingsystems in the same way they did five years ago.andP;  And the systems are gettingmore complicated, involving more resources to implement.&quot;andM;Although is suppliers have responded to the rising support costs faced bytheir customers with new products and services, their full effect won't befelt by vendors for some time.andP;  Improvements to large-scale computeroperating systems  like automating storage management) and to programming like computer-aided software engineering tools) won't begin to significantlyraise demand for big systems until middecade.andM;Until CASE and other tools really take hold, however, suppliers are resortingto the only other alternative available for keeping the cost of computinglow: heavy discounts on new systems.andP;  Users of large-scale systems, midrangesystems and workstations are typically getting 15%-off list price deals fromsuppliers.andP;  Such aggressive pricing can, in some cases, spur significantlyheightened demand from users.andP;  In 1989 IBM, for example, saw its U.S.andP;  salesclimb for the first time since 1985-thanks, in part, to extremely aggressivemainframe pricing.andM;For most of the is industry, the strategy for future growth is to switch tosystems built around standards-whether the commonly accepted operatingsystems like UNIX, MS-DOS or OS/2 or industry-approved communicationsprotocols like Open Systems Interconnect  (OSI).andP;  So-called open systems willdrive revenues for the majority of suppliers in the 1990s.andP;  Only IBM, Digitaland some Japanese suppliers seem to have customer bases big enough to buyenough proprietary platforms to keep them grow-inAnyone smaller-even those onthe scale of a $5.3 billion NCR Corp. or a $5.6 billion Olivetti--must becommitted to open platforms.andM;Open Systems Strategies for SurvivalandM;&quot;By the time the decade is over, I would expect that most, practically all,of our users of our proprietary products will be wearing the open systemshat,&quot; predicts Charles Exley, chairman of Dayton, Ohio-based NCR.andM;&quot;If we had been caught in 1989 without the transitions we have been makingsince 1987, it would have been a disaster for us,&quot; says Vittorio Cassoni,comanaging director of Olivetti.andP;  He's referring to the Ivrea, Italy-basedcompany's decision three years ago to move away from proprietary systemstoward open platforms.andP;  Proprietary products only generated about 10%Olivetti's 1989 system sales.andM;The transition to the new economics of distributed computing is affecting newproduct strategies in almost every corner of the industry, particularly amongminicomputer makers.andP;  Most of the leading U.S.andP;  mini producers-Data GeneralCorp, MAI Basic Four Inc., Prime Computer Inc. and Wang LaboratoriesInc.-either market UNIX-based hardware or intend to do so.andP;  The switch fromproprietary products is costing them, however.andP;  In 1989, DG lost $121million; MAI$40 million; Prime $277 million; Wang $511 million.andP;  On the otherside of the Atlantic, minicomputer makers had their woes too.andP;  Norsk Data ASof Norway lost $69 million.andM;The slowdown in the U.S.andP;  market and the squeeze on profits in 1989 led to apredictable escalation in demands for a high-tech industrial policy in theUnited States.andP;  Advocates of such a policy, like Intel Corp. president AndrewGrove, maintain that the U.S.andP;  system of funding technology initiatives-viamoney raised from venture capitalists or public stock offerings-can't competewith Japan's system.andP;  In japan, individual companies either make long-terminvestments in new technology on their own or in groups in consultation withgovernment planners-often because of economic incentives (e.g., lowerinterest rates) and government directives.andP;  They also enjoy much closer andfriendlier ties to banks, which are themselves oriented toward the long term.andM;But the noise made by policy-minded U.S.andP;  executives apparently isn'treaching the White House.andP;  The Bush administration has promised only to backmeasures like the proposed capital gains tax cut and the relaxation ofantitrust laws, which benefit companies in all industries, not just hightech.andP;  Executives do credit the administration for trying to pry open thejapanese market for big ticket items like satellites and supercomputers.andO;However, they have only themselves to blame for the collapse of U.S.andO;Memories, an industrial consortium proposed to keep the United Statescompetitive in the area of memory chips.andM;The two most important components of the is industry, when judged on thebasis of growth alone, are the software and services associated with systems.andO;One has to look no further than the ranks of the DATAMATION 100 to see thatthe companies providing programs to run on computers and those integratingthem are enjoying spectacular growth.andP;  For example, Electronic Data SystemsCorp. of Dallas expanded its non-General Motors Corp. systems integrationbusiness 30% to nearly $2.5 billion in 1989.andP;  Cap Gemini Sogeti of Paris grew21% to $1.1 billion on the strength of its is services.andP;  Software andamp; ServicesAre PivotalandM;There are now at least seven software or service suppliers with annual isrevenues in excess of $1 billion.andP;  Besides EDS and Cap Gemini, there areAndersen Consulting, Automatic Data Processing Inc., Computer AssociatesInternational Inc., Computer Sciences Corp.andP;  (CSC) and TRW Inc.andM;The biggest force in software flexed its muscles in 1989.andP;  Not only did IBMgrow its software business beyond $8 billion, Big Blue also invested inseveral software companies--including several members of the DATAMATION 100.andO;Notable among them was Management Science America Inc. (now part of Dun andamp;Bradstreet Software).andP;  IBM is also increasing the number of softwareprogrammers it employs, even as it cuts back on workers in other areas.andM;The excitement and investment in software is by no means confined to theUnited States.andP;  In Europe, several other companies besides Cap Gemini areriding the software wave.andP;  Finsiel SpA of Rome and SD-Scicon PLC in Fleet,U.K., have boasted consistently strong growth rates and profitability.andP;  Evenestablished hardware manufacturers in Europe are depending more on softwareand service sales.andP;  The computer division of London-based STC PLC flow drawsnearly half of its $860 million from these segments.andP;  Even japan has caughtthe systems integration bug.andP;  &quot;We are not in competition for hardwareanymore,&quot; Hiroshi Yoshida, an executive with Nihon Unisys Ltd., toldDATAMATION.andP;  &quot;What clients are looking for now is personalized services anddesign capabilities.&quot;andM;But software and services have yet to give the industry the kick it needs toregain double-digit growth or attain higher profits.andP;  For instance, IBM'ssoftware revenues rose only 6.3% in 1989.andP;  Pure-play software providers evenfind the going unsteady: witness the less-than-stellar quarterly performancesturned in by Computer Associates and Oracle.andP;  And who knows how much cutbacksin U.S.andP;  government spending will affect service companies like CSC.andM;Customer Focus Becomes CriticalandM;Software and services, however, represent more than market segments.andP;  Theyreflect just how successful companies-particularly hardware suppilers-are atunderstanding customer needs and developing products to meet those needs.andO;For a number of vendors, that means a whole new way of doing business.andP;  Theyhave to shift the emphasis of research and development out of labs and intocustomer sites.andP;  They have to embark on new distributionstrategies-establishing partnerships to open channels that can best deliverdistributed-computing solutions to users.andP;  They have to develop globalofferings that, nevertheless, can be customized region by region.andP;  In short,they have to listen not to their own employees as much as their customers.andM;One subject they had better lend an ear to is outsourcing.andP;  Increasingly,large users of information systems are asking service providers to assumecontrol of some aspects of their is operations.andP;  Outsourcing, to beprofitable for users and suppliers, depends on a degree of cooperation andunderstanding between both; such cooperation is almost unprecedented in thehistory of the industry.andP;  Fools who rush into the business may findthemselves drowning in red ink.andP;  Those who avoid it may find themselves outof touch with users.andM;When suppliers are on top of changes-such as the need for users in the 1980sto express their individuality via personal computing and the technology(microprocessors) that enabled it-they flourish.andP;  When they are in the throesof change-such as the swift movement toward distributed computing confrontingsuppliers today--they flounder.andM;&quot;Does the data-processing industry have to start each decade with a stumble?&quot;andO;asked Frederic G. Withington in an article in DATAMATION 10 years ago on thesubject of how the industry looked going into 1980.andP;  The analysis byWithington, a former DATAMATION adviser and consultant with Arthur D. LittleInc., would play as well today as it did in 1980.andP;  At the time, earnings forthe world's top computer makers were off-including the first downturn iniBM's earnings since the early 1950s.andP;  Rising wages and other support costswere threatening suppliers' ability to deliver continued gains in the priceand performance of systems.andM;But the similarities end there.andP;  At the start of the 1980s, the number ofpeople who knew how to operate a computer was small.andP;  Marketing took a backseat to engineering.andP;  Customers were fed technology by computer makers.andO;Today, there are at least a 100 million people in the world who know how toboot up a personal computer.andP;  Marketing and engineering are almost synonymousfunctions at most companies.andP;  And customers only want to be fedsolutions--not bits and bytes.andM;Profitability will undoubtedly return to the is industry.andP;  just as the Pcspurred the growth of the 1980s, there will be a new horse, or horses, toride in the 1990s.andP;  Desktop systems based on standard platforms, networkedtogether in client/server relationships will be the heart of corporateinformation management.andM;There will also be a new horse to ride in higher margin software andservices.andP;  But the difference--and it's a big one-is who will be holding thereins.andP;  It's not the suppliers anymore, it's the customers-you.andM;Joseph Kelly, a contributing editor based in New York City, comanaged theDATAMATION 100 project.andM;The companies with the highest revenues per employeeandM;1989                  REV.andP;
