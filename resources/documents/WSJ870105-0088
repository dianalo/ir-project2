That's the deficit target, in billions of dollars, that the administration and Congress must reach in fiscal 1988 to satisfy the harsh demands of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The president's budget is filled with proposals that Congress has flatly rejected in the past and it employs all manner of deficit-cutting gimmicks, but it hits the $108 billion bull's-eye. The president plans to insist that Congress do the same. &quot;He's not going to yield on the target,&quot; says Budget Director James Miller.    But leading congressional budget writers are already considering abandoning the $108 billion goal. They would like to persuade the president to sit down and negotiate a package of spending cuts and tax increases. Among the tax ideas being discussed by Democratic leaders are an oil import fee, a general import fee and some sort of temporary tax surcharge. But if the president continues to resist tax increases, then they want to set a more gradual -- and, they insist, more realistic -- path to a balanced budget. Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles complains that $108 billion is &quot;a very, very tough number.&quot; And House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray says that &quot;many economists&quot; believe a deficit of $135 billion would be better for the economy.    The difference over the deficit target promises to be a centerpiece of the conflict this year between the Democratic Congress and the Republican administration, and it will be an important backdrop in the 1988 struggle for the presidency.    At the heart of the debate are predictions that, for the first time this decade, the federal budget deficit will finally shrink.    Until recently, many budget analysts were still echoing former Budget Director David Stockman's dire forecasts of $200 billion deficits &quot;as far as the eye can see.&quot; But both the administration and the Congressional Budget Office are predicting that the deficit will narrow substantially in the next few years, even without further budget cuts or tax increases.    And private analysts, who have been skeptical of such projections in the past, now say that the figures appear increasingly credible. They cite the dramatic slowing in the growth of defense spending and the drop in interest rates -- which helps reduce federal borrowing costs -- that have occurred over the past year. &quot;We're moving to within a tolerable range&quot; for the deficit, says John Palmer, an economist at the Urban Institute.    After reaching a record $220.7 billion in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30, the deficit is projected by the Office of Management and Budget to be $173 billion this year and about $150 billion in fiscal 1988, if no cuts are made. But the administration's new budget proposes enough spending cuts, asset sales and fee increases to bring the deficit down to $107.8 billion, just below the Gramm-Rudman target, next year.    The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office, which is often less ebullient than its administration counterpart, foresees deficits dropping gradually until they reach $85 billion in fiscal 1992 if current tax and spending policies are left unchanged. However, the administration wants to put the deficit on a path that will produce a surplus of about $12 billion in fiscal 1992.    In part, the projected reductions in the deficit are a testament to the success of the Gramm-Rudman law, which forced both the administration and Congress to agree to some tough budget cutting. &quot;Gramm-Rudman has begun to put the monster of big spending into a cage,&quot; President Reagan said in his weekly radio address Saturday, &quot;and we won't let that monster out.&quot;    But the downward sloping deficit projections could also help to undo Gramm-Rudman this year. With deficits appearing to be shrinking, Congress's desire to fight the flow of red ink may be reduced. &quot;There's definitely less pressure this year (to cut the deficit) than there was last year,&quot; says Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. &quot;Last year they were all hyped up. This year, they'll say: 'We did something last year.'&quot;    Furthermore, the push to cut spending and the deficit has created pent-up demand for spending on clean-water programs, education, job training for displaced workers, housing for the homeless and investment in the nation's basic infrastructure. These wishes put further pressure on the lawmakers to abandon the $108 billion target. &quot;We've squeezed the fat, the skin and some of the muscle out of these domestic programs,&quot; says Chairman Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat. &quot;Now we're down to the marrow.&quot;    Congressional Democrats are wary of expressing their desire to abandon the deficit target; they realize that the president could make political hay out of any Democratic effort to repudiate Gramm-Rudman. With the Democrats in control of both houses of Congress for the first time since President Reagan was elected, the opportunity is greatly enhanced for the administration to gain partisan advantage by bashing the legislature.    Congress also faces economic as well as political risks. While the deficit outlook has improved, &quot;there are so many things that could put us in the soup again,&quot; says Rudolph Penner, the director of the Congressional Budget Office.    One of the main uncertainties is the new tax law. According to official estimates, the revised tax code will yield about the same amount of revenue over the next five years as the previous system would have. But those estimates depend considerably on guesswork, and many experts fear a revenue shortfall.    A renewed surge in interest rates would cause federal borrowing costs to soar, and a recession would cause revenue to plummet. An international confrontation could lead to a renewed increase in defense expenditures. &quot;There's just no margin for risks in our current fiscal stance,&quot; Mr. Penner says. He worries that the relaxed attitude some people are showing toward the projections of diminishing red ink &quot;reflects how quickly we've become inured to what otherwise would be considered absolutely horrendous deficits.&quot;    The approach Mr. Reagan is adopting to the deficit in his new budget, which proposes outlays of $1.024 trillion and marks the first time any president has sought spending of more than $1 trillion, closely resembles his approach in previous years. He is requesting a 3% inflation-adjusted increase for military programs and a rise in spending on foreign aid, space programs, AIDS research and law enforcement. He is planning to curtail or cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, education, farm subsidies, mass transit and dozens of other domestic programs. Overall, spending would be cut from projected levels by $19 billion.    But to reach the $108 billion deficit target for fiscal 1988, the president's budget also includes $23 billion of user fees, asset sales and other proposals that critics denounce as unrealistic fiscal gimmickry. Among these are a plan to raise $1 billion from the sale of Amtrak's Northeast corridor -- despite the fact that these passenger rail operations currently lose money.    Last year, Congress initially hooted at administration proposals to sell federal assets to the private sector, saying that such schemes provide only temporary savings. Later, lawmakers sheepishly concluded that asset sales were less painful than spending cuts and tax increases. One result was a cacophony of complaints that in Gramm-Rudman's first year, the White House and Congress had met the law's requirements for fiscal 1987 with accounting sleights of hand.    But while Gramm-Rudman didn't produce an overall solution to the deficit, many analysts credit the law with easing the nation's fiscal problem. &quot;Sure, there was a lot of smoke and mirrors, a lot of creative accounting,&quot; says Brookings' Mr. Reischauer. &quot;But nevertheless, in an election year, Congress showed a great deal of fiscal discipline. There was a remarkable degree of restraint.&quot;    Defense spending in particular was curbed. The military received an appropriation of $289 billion for fiscal 1987. That was $30 billion below President Reagan's request and $100 billion below the level that the president had envisioned three years ago. Congress also put a lid on domestic spending growth; even so wily a legislator as Jamie Whitten, the Mississippi Democrat who heads the House Appropriations Committee, was unable to persuade his colleagues to save the federal revenue-sharing program.    But Chairman Gray plays down the effects of the budget law, calling it &quot;a symptom but not a cause&quot; of Congress's desire to cut the deficit. He argues that the drastic cuts called for under the budget law for fiscal 1988 could actually exacerbate the deficit problem by slowing economic growth.    Both Rep. Gray and Sen. Chiles, the Florida Democrat, also argue that the large asset sales and user fees in the president's own budget are proof that you can't reach the $108 billion target through spending cuts alone. The Democrats argue that it might be better to craft a proposal that misses the target in fiscal 1988 but includes enough &quot;real&quot; deficit reduction measures to eliminate the deficit by the early 1990s.    &quot;The real problem is not how you get to $108 billion,&quot; says a Democratic Senate aide, &quot;but how you get to zero in four or five years.&quot;    Deputy Budget Director Joseph Wright fears, however, that if Congress does abandon the 1988 target, spending &quot;will just go through the roof&quot; because lawmakers won't feel obliged to find budget savings to offset proposed spending increases, as the law currently requires.    &quot;What they are saying when they say, 'don't meet the $108 billion' -- what they really mean -- is 'let's ignore the whole process,'&quot; says Mr. Wright. &quot;That's what worries me.&quot;    Congressional budget leaders hope that the threat of big cuts in defense and foreign assistance will compel the president to negotiate with them and agree to raise taxes, alter the deficit target, or do some combination of the two. Speaking on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, Rep. Gray suggested converting the nation's trade quotas into tariffs to raise money. Sen. Chiles was less specific but suggested that he might favor &quot;some kind of a surcharge on all of us for a period of three to five years to put the deficit behind us.&quot; Appearing separately on ABC-TV's &quot;This Week,&quot; House Majority Leader Jim Wright said he thought &quot;it's altogether possible we might want to consider&quot; an oil import fee to help pay for deficit reduction.    If the president refuses to yield, however, the Democrats will have to make their own choice: They can abandon the target and face the political consequences, or they can try to make the $108 billion target despite their misgivings. In either event, they're likely to make sharp cuts in defense and foreign aid -- and to turn to the same sorts of sleights of hand that the administration used in its budget.    Whether or not Congress sticks with the $108 billion deficit target for fiscal 1988, Democrats and Republicans agree that they must continue to cut the deficit. &quot;If we're going to do it, we better do it this year,&quot; Rep. Gray says. &quot;Nobody is going to want to bite the bullet in 1988.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
