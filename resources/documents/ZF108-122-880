 Amdilyan has a doctorate in economics fromMoscow University.andP;  In his former job he produced propaganda materials (theconnotations are different here) for the Knowledge Society (Znanie).andP;  Znanieis an organization of Soviet intellectuals which produces books and sponsorslectures on the role of information and knowledge and new technologies;writing and lecturing under its auspices was one of the few waysintellectuals could earn money before perestroika.andP;  Its best-knownpublication is &quot;Arguments and facts,&quot; with 30 million readers, the periodicalwhose editor recently provoked official displeasure by publishing a pollunfavorable to Gorbachev.andM;Znanie is one of 15 co-founders of the ICC, which also include the far morepowerful USSR Academy of Sciences.andP;  Founded in December 1988, ICC has astart-up budget of 5 million rubles but is expected to become self-funding.andO;The International Computer Club was the outfit that first invited us to theSoviet Union last April.andP;  Its charter is &quot;Informatique in the service ofinternational dialoque...uniting the interests of Soviet and foreign usersand producers of modern information technologies to assist in thecomputerization of the Soviet Union.&quot;andP;  Its activities include establishmentof a software and hardware testing lab, a newsletter for members and thesponsorship of visiting dignitaries.andP;  ICC is sponsoring its inauguralconference-cummini-tradeshow in Moscow this June, and Amdilyan will bescouting the Forum for prospective attendees and speakers.andM;ICC has a strong user orientation; in the Soviet Union, that means mostlygovernment ministries, research institutes and factories.andP;  Industriesrepresented include banking, agriculture, railways and manufacturing.andP;  (Theminimum membership fee is 10,000 rubles annually.)andP;  However, one of its 105members, a science institute located in Zelenograd, is about to beginproduction of floppy disks.andP;  There are also seven or eight co-ops and acouple of joint ventures.andP;  Although the staff is authorized at 35 people,Amdilyan would rather have control than size, and has kept it to six, pluseight part-timers and consultants.andM;ALEXANDR BARILOV, 35, is a scientist at the Leningrad Institute ofInformatics and Automation, part of the Soviet Academy of Sciences andresponsible for workstation strategy for the Soviet Union.andP;  Barilov, a crackprogrammer and designer, was assigned to analyze and use the first known IBMpc and Epson printer in the Soviet Union in 1983.andP;  He has supported CentralCommittee and Leningrad telephone company installations, and worked theoperating system for Soviet number-crunchers in space program -- as well asthe system supporting the Soviet Olympic cycling team.andP;  He headed developmentof a tool to make English software bilingual, and specifically ofInformontage, built with that tool, which allows Framework II to operatebilingually in Russian and English.andP;  Barilov is sponsored in the UnitedStates by Ashton-Tate Europe, which is in the final stages (it hopes) ofnegotiating a joint venture with the Institute.andM;ARKADY BORKOVSKY, 35, has just resigned his post at the Computer Center ofthe Soviet Academy of Sciences -- mostly a formality since he hasn't been towork since October.andP;  Instead, he has been working as a programmer in theUnited States, trying to soak up as much knowledge and experience withWestern software technology -- especially in tools for text manipulation --to sustain him when he eventually returns to the Soviet Union.andP;  He is theauthor of Polytext, the first commercial-grade Soviet word-processor for thePC, which lets users intermingle Roman and Cyrillic text.andP;  A newer versioncontains a cross-language dictionary and a Russian spelling checker.andP;  (2)andM;Borkovsky's interests revolve around text-processing, hypertext, language andthe sort of semi-semantic work being shown at the Forum by Verity andIndividual Inc.andP;  (If you think you've caught him in an error in English, takecare; he may just be playing with words -- and with you.)andP;  But he is also oneof the more civic-minded programmers, with a wide circle of friends in theprogramming community with whom he trades ideas and contracts.andP;  Most of theSoviet software co-ops have tried to sign him on full-time, but until now hehas preferred to retain his freedom.andP;  This month he joined Moscow-basedParaGraf in absentia.andP;  ParaGraf is a US-Soviet joint venture, but it's moretruly cooperative than most Soviet co-ops, which are trying to be likeserious US businesses.andM;ParaGraf was founded by Stepan Pachikov, formerly with the Central Economicsand Mathematics Institute of the Academy of Sciences, where he met Borkovskyand several other programmers at the Academy's Computer Center who have sincejoined ParaGraf.andP;  Where Borkovsky is a social activist -- connecting friendswith jobs, people with people -- Pachikov takes a more structured approach,although ParaGraf feels more like a political/user group than a business -- afree-form collection of programmers doing their own thing and selling theirwares through ParaGraf.andP;  Its roster includes Anton Chizhov, author of Alpha,a shareware Cyrillic font driver, and beta, a more polished, commercial setof font drivers and a font-editorf Evgeni Veselov, author of Lexicon, aword-processor, and Master, a Framework-like multifunction development tool;and Pachikov's brother Zhora, who writes games, including Perestroika, anavigate-the-bureaucracy game full of inside jokes that should do well inthis era of East-consciousness, and the Wall (no, just a generic wall, notthe Berlin one), a more-straightforward tactics game which requires you tobreak down a wall with carefully aimed balls.andM;ParaGraf's board includes Abel Aganbegyan and chess-master Gary Kasparov.andM;JACK BYERS, 46, the American chief of Joint Venture Dialog, is an honoraryRussian for the purposes of this listing.andP;  He will be running a couple ofsessions for people interested in learning about JVD in particular and thepleasures and problems of doing business in the Soviet Union in general.andO;Like the pig in the breakfast story, he is committed rather than justinvolved: His wife Laura and their new baby will be joining him to live inMoscow this April, just in time for Jacob Jr.'s christening.andM;MIKHAIL KRASNOV, 37, head of the computer lab at the USA-Canada Institute, isalso a member of a co-op called Inforcom, which consults to Western Firmsinterested in doing business in the USSR.andP;  Inforcom is a partner in a plannedjoint venture called CAT (for Computer Advanced Technologye, which Krasnovwill run after resigning from the Institute.andP;  Working with a US-baseddistributor that doesn't want to be identified until everything is signed andapproved, CAT will import pcs and provide the infrastructure and technologytransfer that will make them useful to their customers.andM;The Inforcom activities are mostly focused on management consulting andbusiness education, with partners at California State University and theMenlo Group, as well as the USSR's All-Union Economic Society.andM;The USA-Canada Institute has extremely good connections both in the USSR andin the West, and is a hotbed of modern management and economic thinking inthe USSR.andP;  Krasnov, although he runs the technical end of things at theInstitute and has a masters degree in computer science from the MoscowInstitute of Aviation, also has a degree in economics from Moscow Universityas well as a PhD in economic georgraphy from the USA-Canada Institute.andP;  Hehas access to a large band of programmers who now do or used to work at theInstitute, as well as others he had encountered over the years.andP;  He is one ofthe best-informed sources on the current status of joint ventures in theUSSR, and will lead a discussion on the subject at a &quot;company&quot; presentation.andM;IGOR MIZIN and VIKTOR PRACHENKO are the director and the head of a technicaldepartment respectively of the Moscow-based Institute of Problems inInformatics (IPIAN).andP;  With 400 people, IPIAN is the arm of the Soviet Academyof Sciences charged with the computerization of Soviet society -- both acause and effect of perestroika.andP;  As director of IPIAN, Mizin is successor toBoris Naumov, a leader in the Soviet computerization movement who died of aheart attack in 1988.andP;  The Institute is known for its work in databasetechnology, including object-oriented databases and knowledge representation,and for strong political connections.andM;IPIAN recently formed a joint venture, Intersoft, with Software ProductsInternational, vendor of Open Access, a suite of office automation toolsincluding database, word-processing, spreadsheet and the like.andP;  SPI gets 90percent of its sales outside the US and is the leading pc package in Spainand third in West Germany, the company says.andP;  (President John Bowne is alsoat the Forum.)andM;Prachenko, a specialist in office automation, runs the unit of IPIANconcerned with office automation and pcs, and with Intersoft.andP;  He is leadinga team of programmers who are building a Russian version of Open Access forsale inside and outside of USSR.andP;  The deal also envisions joint developmentof new products in both Russian and English.andM;VALERITT MIRANTSEV, 43, is head of the software and hardware department forexternal contacts at JV Dialogue.andP;  Educated in mathematical statistics at theUniversity of Moscow, he still teaches there part-time; it's a good source ofyour programmers for JV Dialogue.andP;  At JVD since August, he leads a group ofabout 12 project managers who identify software and hardware in the SovietUnion which can be finished and marketed by JVD.andP;  These include software forgames, statistics, translation, education and physics, as well as electronicproducts and materials.andM;ALEXEI (LYOSHA) PAJITNOV, 34, is the author of Tetris and Welltris.andP;  He isthe Soviet programmer best-known outside the country, and is getting aglimpse of what that means on his first trip to the United States.andP;  In theSoviet Union he still has his day job as a mathematician at the Academy ofSciences' Computer Center (where Borkovsky also worked).andP;  Like perestroika inthe large, the personal perestroika of Pajitnov's fame hasn't changed hislife much, but it has irrevocably altered his outlook and his sense ofpossibilities.andM;(2) Russian spell-checking is an interesting proposition: There are fewerroot words in Russian than in English, but most words take on many forms,regular and irregular, determined by parameters including case (nominative,accusative, genitive, dative, etc.), gender, tense and number.andP;  In addition,the roots change internal form (and meaning) depending on the suffixes andprefixes, of which there are many.andP;  In short, you need more rules and fewerstrings.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
