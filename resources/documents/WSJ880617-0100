Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CTUS </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A team of London geneticists reported that a simple mouthwash can obtain cells needed in tests for human genetic defects.    The mouthwash could replace the taking of blood samples, potentially making mass screening for genetic diseases far simpler and less expensive.    The researchers, at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School here, used gene-analysis techniques developed three years ago by Cetus Corp., an Emeryville, Calif.-based biotechnology company.    The mouthwash method, reported in this week's issue of the Lancet, a leading British medical journal, only requires that people rinse with a simple salt solution to collect loose tissue from the linings of their mouths.    The St. Mary's team ran the used mouthwash through Cetus's chemical-analysis technique. In just a few hours, the scientists were able to detect whether the tissue cells contained genetic fragments thought to be associated with cystic fibrosis, a severe inherited disorder of the lungs and digestive system.    Nicholas Lench, a St. Mary's geneticist who led the researchers, said the mouthwash method might be used to screen for many other genetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia. Existing gene tests for such disorders normally require expensive, three-day processing of blood samples.    In an editorial, the Lancet said the mouthwash method &quot;has enormous potential in population screening for single gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis.&quot; It added that the related Cetus chemical-analysis technique, called polymerase chain reaction, &quot;is set to revolutionize&quot; the technology of identifying genes.    Under the Cetus technique, lab technicians perform a series of relatively simple chemical tricks that make a suspected gene rapidly reproduce and become easily detectable. The technique avoids the radioactive materials and delicate lab work generally needed to spot genes. </TEXT></DOC>
