As a general matter, these federal standards preempt State andlocal standards and any other State and local requirements with respectto energy efficiency or energy use of these products. Among other things,NAECA requires DOE to consider amending the energy conservation standardsfor dishwashers, clothes washers and clothes dryers. Based on an Environmental Assessment (EA), (DOE/EA-0386), DOE has determinedthat the proposal of any of the candidate amended energy efficiency standardsfor dishwashers, clothes washers and clothes dryers would not be a majorfederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentwithin the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).Therefore an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.

L. 91-190, 40 U.S.C. 4221 et seq., and the implementing regulationsof the Council on Environmental Quality [40 CFR Parts 1500-1508]. The EAaddresses the possible incremental environmental effects attributable tothe application of a range of candidate amended standards (in the formof engineering changes) to the design of dishwashers, clothes washers,and clothes dryers. The effects of the candidate amended standards rangefrom no change to a slight improvement in the environment as discussedin the General Findings below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Approach Used in the Analysis </ITAG>The EA evaluates the environmental impacts resulting from the proposedsetting of a range of amended energy-efficiency standards for dishwashers,clothes washers, and clothes dryers in accordance with the NAECA. A completedescription of the Engineering and Economic Analysis of the range of amendedstandards may be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD). The main environmental concern addressed is emissions from fossil fueledelectricity generation. Each of the design options for dishwashers, clotheswashers and clothes dryers would result in decreased electricity use and,therefore, reduced powerplant emissions. The proposed efficiency standardswould decrease air pollution by decreasing future energy demand. The greatestdecreases in air pollution would be in sulfur oxides. Some design options for dishwashers would also reduce water consumption,resulting in lower in-house emissions from fuel-burning water heaters.An in-depth analysis of particulate emissions is not included in the EAbecause particulate emissions are minor compared to sulfur and nitrogenoxide emissions. For example, in 1984 power plants contributed only 7 percentof U.S. total particulate emissions as compared to contributions of 83percent and 34 percent of total SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions, respectively (EPA, 1986) <ITAG tagnum="84">General Findings </ITAG>1. Dishwashers The greatest environmental impacts of the candidate standards would resultfrom generating less electricity. Power plants' main environmental effectson air and water result from emissions of sulfur oxides (SO<T2>x</T2>), nitrogen oxides (NO<T2>x</T2>), and carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>). All SO<T2>x</T2> and NO<T2>x</T2> emissions are expressed in the equivalent weights of SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2>, respectively. Carbon dioxide emissions are commonly expressedas tons of carbon. General findings are summarized below. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Sulfur Dioxide </ITAG>The greatest decrease in air pollution would occur for sulfur dioxide.The range of expected reductions from the candidate standards is from 4,442tons, or 0.03 percent of the U.S. SO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants in the year2010, to a level of 9,523 tons, or 0.06 percent of the expected U.S. powerplant emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> in 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Nitrogen Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in NO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 3,299 tons, or0.03 percent of the total NO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants in the year2010, to a level of 6,869 tons, or 0.07 percent of the expected U.S. powerplant emissions of NO<T2>2</T2> in 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carbon Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from the equivalentof 350,000 tons, or 0.02 percent of the total CO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted in the U.S. in the year 2010,to a level of 704,000 tons, or 0.04 percent of expected U.S. emissionsof CO<T2>2</T2> in 2010. The candidate dishwasher standards would also save 197 billion to 276 billiongallons of water during the 1993-2015 time period. None of the environmental impacts from the savings of SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standards is considered to be significant.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Clothes Washers </ITAG>The greatest environmental impact of the candidate standards for clotheswashers would be a decrease in electricity consumption. General findingsare summarized below: <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Sulfur Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 8,943 tons, or0.05 percent of the expected U.S. power plant emissions of SO<T2>2</T2> in 2010, to a level of 21,528 tons or 0.13 percent of the U.S.SO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants in the year2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Nitrogen Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in NO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 6,759 tons, or.07 percent of the U.S. NO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants in the year2010, to a level of 15,875 tons, or 0.16 percent of 2010 emissions of NO<T2>2</T2> from U.S. power plants. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carbon Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 736,000 tons,or 0.04 percent of the expected CO<T2>2</T2> emissions in the U.S. in 2010, to a level of 1,677,000 tons,or C.09 percent of the CO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected in the U.S. in the year 20l0. The environmental impacts from the savings of SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standards are considered to be insignificant.3. Clothes Dryers The greatest impact of the candidate standard levels for clothes dryersis a decrease in electricity consumption. General findings are summarizedbelow:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Sulfur Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 10,552 tons, or0.06 percent of the SO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected from U.S. power plants in the year 2010,to a level of 38,230 tons, which would represent 0.22 percent of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions by U.S. power plants in 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Nitrogen Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in NO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 7,020 tons, or0.07 percent of the U.S. NO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by U.S. power plants in theyear 2010, to a level of 25,641 tons, representing 0.25 percent of NO<T2>2</T2> emissions by U.S. power plants in 2010. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Carbon Dioxide </ITAG>The expected reductions in CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standard levels range from 638,000 tons,or 0.04 tons of the CO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted in the U.S. in the year 2010,to a level of 2,398,000 tons, or 0.13 percent of U.S. emissions of CO<T2>2</T2> in 2010. The environmental impacts from the savings of SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> from the candidate standards are considered to be insignificant.In conclusion, no levels of the candidate standards for the appliances,individually or cumulatively, would result in significant reductions ofSO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2>, or CO<T2>2</T2> and therefore none would result in significant environmentalimpacts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination </ITAG>Based upon the EA, DOE has determined that the proposal of any of the candidateamended energy-efficiency standards for dishwashers, clothes dryers andclothes washers would not constitute a major federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of NEPA.Therefore, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, May 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Peter N.
