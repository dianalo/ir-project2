(HP) puttheir output cards on the table last week, detailing plans to support outlinefonts in a variety of operating systems and printer page-descriptionlanguages.andM;Ending months of speculation, IBM announced its intention to include outlinefonts in a forthcoming version of its OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM).andO;Microsoft, which made a similar announcement last fall, last week extendedits support of outline fonts by vowing to include them in future versions ofWindows, as well.andM;On the printer-language side, Microsoft discussed plans to enhance itsoutline font-equipped PostScript clone, MS-PDL, while HP reiterated its plansto support outline fonts in a next-generation page-description language forits LaserJet printers, due next month.andM;Outline fonts are technically superior to the bit-mapped fonts often used inPC software and printers because they let users manipulate typefaces moreprecisely and provide a closer resemblance between on-screen and printedappearances.andP;  The inclusion of these fonts in OS/2 and Windows will make iteasier to incorporate the sophisticated typefaces; currently, users must runfont software separately on the PC or printer to tap the technology.andM;Speaking at last week's PC/ Desktop Printing Conference here, Richard Hayes,IBM's font and printer product manager, confirmed that the PC giant will sooninclude an outline-font format in a forthcoming version of OS/2 PM.andM;IBM's outline-font strategy is broader than Microsoft's plan to include AppleComputer Inc.'s Royal outline fonts in PM, Hayes said.andP;  IBM may include aformat such as Royal or Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript Type I, but will alsoinclude its own Integrated Font Interface (IFI).andP;  IFI provides compatibilitywith all third-party outline fonts, Hayes said.andM;Before IBM's statement last week, vendors and users were unsure whetherRoyal, PostScript or another format would become the industry's de factooutline-font standard.andM;&quot;IBM's decision makes it clear there will be room for at least two fontstandards in the PC world -- Royal and Type I PostScript,&quot; said JonathanSeybold, publisher of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, based inMalibu, Calif.andM;IBM will support outline fonts across all of its Systems ApplicationArchitecture platforms, giving users access to a common font format forprinting sophisticated documents, Hayes said.andM;Not to be outdone, Microsoft last week revealed plans to support Royaloutline fonts in future versions of Windows.andP;  Dan Steele, marketing directorof the firm's Printer Business Unit in Redmond, Wash., declined to say whichversion of Windows would be the first to sport outline fonts, but sourcesbriefed by the firm said the fonts will appear in a version after 3.0'sscheduled spring release.andM;Steele added that Microsoft will incorporate into MS-PDL elements of theGraphics Programming Interface (GPI) used in PM, and will inexpensivelylicense the language to third parties.andM;HP will lend its support to printer-based outline fonts next month when itannounces its next-generation Printer Command Language (PCL) for LaserJetprinters.andP;  PCL 5 will include Agfa Compugraphic Division's Intellifontoutline-font format, enabling printers to scale and rotate fonts on the fly,said Richard Belluzzo, general manager of HP's printer division in Boise,Idaho.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
