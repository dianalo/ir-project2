Such negotiations have taken weeks after past elections, butThai Nation leader Chatichai Choonhavan, whose party got the mostvotes, said after Sunday's ballot he felt a prime minister could beagreed upon this week.   His party and its three partners in the last coalition won 58percent of the 357 seats in Parliament's lower house. Prem, a67-year-old former general, has no party affilitation.   Chatichai, who was a deputy premier in the last government,already has expressed support for keeping Prem in office. The primeminister has made no public statements about the matter.   Political analysts predict difficulties ahead for anadministration led by the former general.   ``The new government will face the same difficult problems itendured under Prem's last administration because there is growingand open resentment of and opposition to Prem,'' said SomboonSuksamran, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University inBangkok.   Friction among coalition partners caused trouble in Prem's lastgovernment.   Somboon and other political observers say Prem might not be ableto complete a four-year term. He called Sunday's election two yearsearly.   Prem has been prime minister since 1980, dissolved Parliamenttwice for elections, survived two coup attempts and formed fivecabinets. He is the longest-serving premier in modern Thai history.   Among his serious problems are flagging support in the powerfulmilitary, sharp criticisms from opposition parties and protests bystudents and labor.   ``These pressures will only get more intense,'' Somboon told TheAssociated Press.   Party leader Chatichai told newsmen Monday a ``gentlemen'sagreement'' had been reached by the four coalition partners to backPrem. The person chosen also must be approved by King BhumibolAdulyadej, Thailand's constitutional monarch.   Thai Nation, Chatichai's well-financed party, won 87 seats inthe House of Representatives in Thailand's 17th general electionand its coalition partners got a total of 123: Social Action Party54; the Democrat Party 48 and Citizens' Party 21.   Interior Minister Prachuab Soontrangkul said 16.9 million of the26.6 million eligible voters participated.   Sixteen parties entered 3,606 candidates and only one partyfailed to win representation in Parliament. The main oppositiongroup, the Thai Citizens' Party, won 31 seats.   The Thai Unity party gained 35 seats and was considered apossible coalition member, but party leader Narong Wongwan toldThai journalists he would not join a ``Prem coalition.''   Thai elections center largely on personalities, not politicalplatforms, and the main question in this election was whether Premshould continue in office.   Despite the factionalism in his government, Prem has had thesupport of three of the nation's most powerful institutions: themilitary, bureaucracy and monarchy.</TEXT></DOC>
