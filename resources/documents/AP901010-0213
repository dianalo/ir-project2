In a case that could affect millions of working women, JusticesJohn Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia voiceddoubts about the wisdom and legality of such a policy.   The court is expected to decide by July whether the policyamounts to illegal sex discrimination.   The three justices, along with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy,dominated an hour-long argument session. They posed numerousquestions to the two lawyers before them, firing their most bitinginquiries at Stanley Jaspan, who represented the Milwaukee-basedJohnson Controls Inc.   Stevens seemed dubious when asking Jaspan about the overall riskposed to women working at Johnson Controls' 13 battery-makingplants.   When Jaspan argued that exposure to lead, the principal materialused in making batteries, ``poisons the fetus and causes permanentbrain damage,'' Stevens interrupted to ask, ``How often does thishappen?''   He asked whether ``the slightest risk'' was enough to renderinapplicable a federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, banning on-the-job sex bias.   O'Connor and Scalia took issue with Jaspan's interpretation ofwhat legal duty employers face under a 1978 amendment, called thePregnancy Discrimination Act, to the law.   ``You are not coming to grips with the effect of the PregnancyDiscrimination Act,'' O'Connor told Jaspan.   And Scalia said Jaspan's suggestion that employers may treatpregnant workers differently if fetal health is an issue ``is tomake a farce'' of the 1978 law. ``You're making it a ridiculouspiece of legislation,'' Scalia said.   But Jaspan held firm in defending the company's policy. ``Itwould violate common sense ... to require an employer to damageunborn children,'' he argued.   Marsha Berzon, the San Francisco lawyer representing thepolicy's challengers, told the justices, ``The net effect of apolicy like this is to sanction the re-segregation of the workforce.''   She said such policies could ``render women marginal workers andoust them from the workplace.''   One federal judge, calling the case the most important sex-biasdispute in decades, said the estimated number of women affectedruns as high as 20 million.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. Whiteeach asked only one question during Wednesday's session.   Three court members - Justices David H. Souter, ThurgoodMarshall and Harry A. Blackmun - did not ask any questions.   The nation's largest manufacturer of car batteries, JohnsonControls adopted its policy in 1982, declaring certain jobs offlimits for fertile women.   Those who could not prove they were infertile were transferredto other jobs, although their salaries were not cut. Some of thewomen were in their 60s.   Fertile women now hired are ineligible for top-paying jobs withthe greatest lead exposure at the company's plants in California,Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan,Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin.   The policy was upheld in lower courts.</TEXT></DOC>
