(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An inexpensive drug used to treatbronchitis appeared to block production of the AIDS virus intest-tube experiments, researchers said.   The researchers cautioned against human use of the drug untilthe outcome of further study.   The drug is not a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,scientists at Stanford University said Tuesday in announcingresults of lab tests.   But they said it could slow down the virus' assault on theimmune system, as well as prolong and improve the patient's qualityof life when used with AZT or other drugs approved for treatingAIDS.   Unlike Compound Q, a sometimes toxic protein distilled from aChinese cucumber root, dextran sulfate from Japan or high-pricedAZT, the drug under study at Stanford is readily available andrelatively cheap and safe.   ``I am really optimistic about this,'' said Dr. LeonoreHerzenberg, a professor of genetics at Stanford, who worked on theresearch with her husband, geneticist Dr. Leonard Herzenberg.   ``Looking at the scientific evidence for what this drug does,and the scientific evidence for how AIDS works, our guess is thattreatment with this drug may be quite good. But until we get ittested in patients, we won't know if it will work.''   The drug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is used for treating chronicbronchitis and other lung ailments, and as an antidote to overdosesof acetaminophen, the ingredient in Tylenol and otherover-the-counter pain relievers. The drug is made by the ZambonGroup in Italy and is available in liquid form in the United Statesand in tablet form in Europe. Bristol-Myers Co. makes a vaporizedformula with the drug called Mucomist.   Mrs. Herzenberg warned that AIDS patients should not begintaking the drug in any form before further experiments show whetherthe drug works on AIDS in humans.   ``We're moving as quickly as possible and we are now talkingwith physicians about doing clinical tests,'' she said.   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation forAIDS Research, said the experiments sounded promising, but he alsourged caution.   ``While I think this holds promise, we have to have ... tests onhumans before we know how effective it will be,'' Silverman said.   NAC blocks the triggering of AIDS virus production by increasingglutathione levels in blood cells affected by the virus, theHerzenbergs said. Glutathione eliminates potentially harmfuloxidizing agents and is essential for energy generation and othercell functions.   The Herzenbergs are scheduled to report preliminary results ofthe research today at an international conference exploringresearch strategies on AIDS in Geneva.</TEXT></DOC>
