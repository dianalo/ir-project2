Butthere seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough.   After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered theirnegotiators to return to Geneva on July 12 to work on a proposedtreaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50percent.   Gorbachev told reporters ``it is still possible to sign anagreement in this administration.'' Reagan said, ``Conversationsare still going on and they are still being discussed and I sayprogress is still being made or we wouldn't be talking as we are.''   In a 24-page joint statement, the two leaders announced``achievement of substantial additional common ground'' on two ofthe five major disputed areas on the proposed Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty (START), ways of monitoring mobile missiles andcounting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on warplanes.   But U.S. arms negotiator Edward Rowny said there was ``a lot ofroom'' to go in the two areas.   And he said ``we didn`t get anywhere'' on the two biggestobstacles to a treaty: keeping track of submarine-fired cruisemissiles and Soviet objections to Reagan's Star Warsmissile-defense program, formally known as the Strategic DefenseInititiative.   Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched aheadon other arms control issues.   They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate-RangeNuclear Forces treaty (INF) to eliminate medium-range nuclearmissiles, which was signed at the Washington summit last Decemberand ratified by the Senate last Friday and by the Soviet assemblyof presidents 17 hours later.   During the summit, Gorbachev and Reagan also signed two lesserarms control agreements, one requiring advance notifice ofballistic missile tests and another to tighten verificationprocedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.   On the START treaties, U.S. officials said they had restatedopposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles.   ``It is the position of the United States that such missilesshould be banned unless the United States and the Soviet Union canreach agreement on provisions which provide for effectiveverification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclearweapons carried by such missiles,'' U.S. officials said.   U.S. officials, in a briefing paper given to reporters, saidthat acceptable verification rules would require, among otherthings, restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas,means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all suchweapons, and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspectedviolations.   The two sides remained far apart on Star Wars and how tonegotiate reductions in conventional armies.   ``We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,''Gorbachev told reporters.   The Kremlin leader, who has used all four meetings with Reaganas forums to air his opposition to Star Wars, said he had proposedresolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspectionof facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense istested.   But no strategic arms treaty is possible, he said, without anagreement assuring that development and deployment of strategicdefenses does not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.And a fifth summit would not be possible without a START deal, hesaid.   On the opening day of the talks, U.S. and Soviet officials said,Gorbachev suggested to Reagan that they exchange data onconventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts, as proposed bythe Russians in 1986.   U.S. officials say they will not directly negotiate conventionalcuts with the Soviets, because the matter must be agreed upon bythe 33 nations taking part in the Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe.   Those talks also include discussion of alleged Soviet violationsof human rights provisions of the original conference accord,signed in Helsinki in 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
