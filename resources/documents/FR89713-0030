Both species areendemic to Middle Park in Grand County, Colorado, where they grow on shalebadlands. Penland beardtongue is only known within 2 miles of the typelocality. The Osterhout milk-vetch occurs in scattered populations overa 15-mile range. Both species occur largely on Federal land administeredby the Bureau of Land Management, with smaller occurrences on State andprivate land. The Osterhout milk-vetch would be impacted directly by damconstruction and inundation, and secondarily by recreational uses and developmentaround the proposed Muddy Creek Reservoir. The single Penland beardtonguearea is a fragile habitat vulnerable to off-road vehicle damage.

They are restrictedto badlands of Upper Cretaceous Niobrara and Pierre Shale and of Tertiary(Miocene Troublesome Formation) siltstone sediments at 2,250-2,350 meters(7,450-7,700 feet) elevation within 6 miles to the north and east of thetown of Kremmling. <T3>Astragalus osterhoutii </T3>Jones was described in 1923 by Marcus Jones(1923) from material collected by George Osterhout, an early Colorado botanist.Osterhout first collected it in fruit July 17, 1905 (specimen 3038), andin flower June 9, 1906 (specimen 3235) at ``Sulphur Springs'' (holotype)and ``about 4 miles below Sulphur Springs, Grand County'' (cotype). Theholotype (at the Pomona College Herbarium, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,California) is a combination of material from these two specimens. Thetype locality had been interpreted to be near the town of Hot Sulphur Springs,which is 17 miles east of Kremmling (Barneby 1964, Peterson et al. 1981);but, despite several searches, the Osterhout milk-vetch has never beenfound in this area. However, the population recently located along TroublesomeCreek is adjacent to Sulphur Gulch, which contains a Sulphur Spring (about6 miles northeast of Kremmling), and this is likely the type locality (RupertBarneby, New York Botancial Garden, <T3>in litt., </T3>1987). Until the 1980's, <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>was collected only five times and from two additionallocalities: a small population 1 mile northeast of Kremmling and the largestpopulation along Muddy Creek 6 miles north of Kremmling. These populationswere discovered by Beath in 1939 and 1940 respectively (Peterson <T3>et al. </T3>1981). The population along Muddy Creek was further delineatedduring the preparation of the status report (Peterson <T3>et al. </T3>1981) and the Rock Creek/Muddy Creek Reservoir Draft EnvironmentalImpact Statement (Grah and Neese 1987). Occurrences along Pass Creek andRed Dirt Creek near Hinman Reservoir, a few miles west of Muddy Creek,were also discovered during inventories for the Draft Environmental ImpactStatement (Grah and Neese 1987). During graduate studies at the Universityof Colorado, Jeff Karron located two sites, 1 mile and 5 miles  northeastof Kremmling, the latter along Troublesome Creek. These sites probablyrepresent Beath's 1939 locality and Osterhout's original ``Sulphur Springs''locality in the Sulphur Gulch/Troublesome Creek vicinity, respectively.In the summer of 1988, the author found a small colony of about 500 plantsof <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>on a shale hill along the north side of the ColoradoRiver 3 miles east of Troublesome Creek. There are an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 Osterhout milk-vetch plants, approximately90 percent of the total for the species, in the vicinity of Muddy Creek.The remaining 10 percent of the species occurs on the eastern and westernextremities of the range at Troublesome and Red Dirt Creek (a tributaryof Muddy Creek), respectively.<T3>Penstemon penlandii </T3>Weber was independently discovered in thesummer of 1986 by David Johnson of Western Resource Development Company(Weber 1986) and the author while on visits to the Osterhout milk-vetchTroublesome Creek site located by Karron. While the Osterhout milk-vetchis found only along one gulch here, the Penland beardtongue populationof approximately 5,000 plants extends over the whole series of badlandsbetween Troublesome Creek and Sulphur Gulch, which are approximately 1\1/2\miles long and \1/2\ mile wide. In the summer of 1988, the author locateda small colony of 500 plants along Troublesome Creek 2 miles north of thetype locality. This is the only known area for the Penland beardtongue.<T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>P. penlandii </T3>are both disjunct from their nearest relatives, whichoccur approximately 150 miles away in southwestern Wyoming and northwesternColorado: <T3>A. grayi </T3>and <T3>A. nelsonianus </T3>(Barneby 1964), and <T3>P. paysoniorum </T3>(Weber 1986) and <T3>P. gibbensii </T3>(personal observation), respectively. These speciesmay be remnants of a previous extension of northern species southward duringglacial or pluvial periods. As such, they can provide clues to past floristicmigrations and are scientifically valuable in the study of biogeography.<T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>has also been the subject of evolutionary studiescomparing rare and common species of <T3>Astragalus </T3>(Karron 1987a). Their adaptation to specific geologichabitats makes them good scientific subjects for such studies. <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>is a tall rush-like plant with linear leafletsand several bright green stems up to 100 centimeters (40 inches) tall.There are 12-25 large white flowers, 2.4 centimeters (1.0 inch) long, perinflorescence (flowering stalk), and stipitate pendulous pods, 4.5 centimeters(1.8 inches) long. <T3>P. penlandii </T3>is a short plant with linear leaves and several clumped,pubescent stems up to 25 centimeters (10.0 inches) tall. There are 5-15bright bicolored flowers with blue lobes and a violet throat, 1.2-1.5 centimeters(0.5-0.6 inch) long, per inflorescence; the fruits are small brown capsules.Both species are characterized by clusters of showy flowers relative tothe size of the plant. The largest population of the Osterhout milk-vetch occurs on shale benchesalong Muddy Creek, the site of the proposed Muddy Creek Reservoir. Whilethe lower edges of this population would be inundated by the proposed reservoir,there would be additional impacts to the remainder of the population fromassociated development and recreational use of the reservoir and the surroundingbenches (U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management 1988).Changes in vegetative composition, particularly an increase in big sagebrushdensity due to past grazing history, may have resulted in a decrease inthe size and/or density of Osterhout milk-vetch populations. The TroublesomeCreek/Sulphur Gulch badlands, the habitat of both the Osterhout milk-vetchand Penland beardtongue, are a fragile habitat susceptible to damage fromoff-road vehicle use. Approximately two-thirds of the large Osterhout milk-vetchpopulation along Muddy Creek is on Federal land administered by the Bureauof Land Management (Bureau); the remaining one-third is mostly on privateland, with two colonies on State land (although the edges of other Osterhoutmilk-vetch colonies may be within State highway rights-of-way). The smalloccurrences up Pass Creek and Red Dirt Creek near Hinman Reservoir areon private land. The small site 1 mile northeast of Kremmling is on Bureauland, and the Troublesome Creek/Sulphur Gulch populations of Osterhoutmilk-vetch and Penland beardtongue are on Bureau land and private land.Federal action involving <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>began with section 12 of the Endangered SpeciesAct (Act) of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service publisheda notice of its acceptance of this report as a petition within the contextof section 4(c)(2), now section 4(b)(3)(A), of the Act and of its intentionthereby to review the status of those plants. <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>was included as ``endangered'' in the July 1, 1975,petition. On December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82485), and September 27, 1985 (50FR 39526), the Service published updated notices reviewing the native plantsbeing considered for classification as threatened or endangered. <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>was included in these notices as a category 2 species.Category 2 comprises taxa for which the Service possesses information indicatingthat proposing to list them as endangered or threatened species is possiblyappropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerabilityand threat(s) are not currently available to support listing. The presentproposal is based on biological data from Peterson et al. (1981), Karron(1987a), and Grah and Neese (1987).Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary of the Interior to make findings on certain petitions within1 year of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the Act's amendments of 1982further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treatedas having been newly submitted on that date. Because the 1975 Smithsonianreport was accepted as a petition, all the taxa contained in the notice,including <T3>A. osterhoutii,</T3> were treated as being newly petitioned on October13, 1982. On October 13, 1983, October 12, 1984, October 11, 1985, October10, 1986, and October 9, 1987, the Service made successive 1-year findingsthat the petition to list <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> was warranted, but precluded by other listing actionsof higher priority. The Service published a proposed rule to list <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> and <T3>P. penlandii</T3> as endangered species on July 5, 1988 (53 FR 25181),constituting the next 1-year finding that would have been required on orbefore October 9, 1988. Because it was discovered in 1986, after the last notice of review forplants was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in 1985, there has been no previous Federal actioninvolving <T3>P. penlandii.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the July 5, 1988, proposed rule (53 FR 25181) and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateand Federal agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, andother interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices that invited public comments were published in the <T3>Middle Park Times</T3> on August 4, 11, 18, and 25, 1988, and in the<T3>Rocky Mountain News</T3> on September 1 and 2, 1988. A public hearingwas requested by the Grand County Board of Commissioners (County) on August5, 1988, and by the Colorado River Water Conservation District (Water District)on August 12, 1988. The Service extended the initial comment period toOctober 24, 1988 (53 FR 37009), to accommodate the requested public hearingwhich was held on October 13, 1988, in Kremmling, Colorado. Newspaper noticesannouncing the public hearing and the extension of the comment period werepublished in the <T3>Middle Park Times</T3> on October 6, 1988, and in the <T3>Rocky Mountain News</T3> on October 6 and 7, 1988. At the hearing aService botanist read a prepared statement and showed slides of the plantsand their habitat. Individuals in the audience were then given the opportunityto present their oral comments. Following the comments there was a questionand answer period. Six people attended the public hearing and three presentedoral comments. Eleven written comments also were received in response tothe proposed rule. The three oral comments were from parties who also submittedwritten comments and raised similar issues. Seven written comments in support were received, including the State, conservationgroups, and professional botanists; three written comments in oppositionwere received from a local (county) government and a local water district;and one written comment was neutral. Two oral comments in opposition tothe listing were received from a local water district and a local (county)government, and one supporting comment was received from a professionalbotanist. Written and oral comments of similar content are grouped intoa number of general issues. These issues and the Service's response toeach are discussed below. <T3>Issue 1:</T3> The Water District and the County stated that the estimatedpopulation size of Osterhout milk-vetch along Muddy Creek was 100,000 plantsand that the plant covered 50 percent more acres in 1987 than in 1985.Therefore, the impacts of the Muddy Creek Reservoir were less than indicatedin the Service's proposed rule which states 25,000 plants and uses the1985 acreage figure.<T3>Response: </T3>The 100,000 figure was used in a preliminary BiologicalAssessment (U.S. Forest Service 1987), but the final Biological Assessment(U.S. Bureau of Land Management 1989) and the Supplemental Draft EnvironmentalImpact Statement (U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management 1988)use a figure of 50,000 plants. The estimate of 25,000 plants is the resultof personal observations by a Service botanist in July 1986, August 1987,and July 1988. All of these figures are based on ocular estimates of thesame plant populations, but by different observers. The higher figuresare based on extrapolations of an estimated average density over the totalacreage, rather than an actual census. Extrapolations are usually highestimates because plants are not evenly distributed in nature, due to suchthings as micro-habitat differences or limited seed dispersal. The Servicebelieves that the degree or level of impact should be determined basedon the low end of population fluctuations, which represents its base populationnumber. The range of <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>does not appear to be expanding and is still confinedto a small part of Middle Park. It should also be understood that duringflood stages an additional, undetermined number of plants would be inundated.Moreover, besides the direct impacts, another 80 acres of habitat couldbe impacted by recreational activities and development. <T3>Issue 2: </T3>The Water District and the County stated that existingBureau of Land Management regulations and the Conservation Plan proposedin the (now) Final Biological Assessment (U.S. Bureau of Land Management1989) are sufficient to minimize impacts to <T3>A. osterhoutii. </T3><T3>Response: </T3>Unless <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>is listed there would be no legal requirement forthe Bureau to make the Conservation Plan or any other measures permit conditionsof the project. The Final Biological Assessment (U.S. Bureau of Land Management1989) specifically states that protection would only be required by theBureau if Osterhout milk-vetch is listed, which supports the need for listing.The Service believes that the Conservation Plan by itself may be insufficientto protect the species, and that protection of additional plant sites isnecessary. Moreover, the habitat manipulation techniques in the ConservationPlan are experimental and their success uncertain. And finally, if thespecies is not listed there is no law requiring the Bureau to protect thespecies and administer its recovery if the Conservation Plan falls shortof its goal or if future activities are planned that could affect the species.<T3>Issue 3: </T3>The Water District stated that ``* * * the best scientificand commercial data currently available does not justify * * * endangeredstatus [for <T3>Astraqalus osterhoutii</T3>].'' <T3>Response: </T3>Professional botanists who have worked on the species,including a Service botanist, a graduate student whose dissertation includedthe species, professional botanists with the State and conservation groups,and consultants on the Muddy Creek Reservoir, think that existing biologicaldata support endangered status. Their data and conclusions are includedin this rulemaking. A pre-proposal letter from a consultant stated: ``Bothspecies are highly vulnerable to extinction by virtue of extremely limiteddistribution habitat, and population numbers * * *'' (Elizabeth Neese,independent consultant, <T3>in litt., </T3>1988). Also, their fragile habitat is highly susceptibleto surface disturbance. The Osterhout milk-vetch was a candidate for listingas threatened or endangered (1980) before the Muddy Creek Dam was proposed(1985). <T3>Issue 4: </T3>The Water District stated that listing would not furtherelevate awareness of the plant's status and promote conservation efforts.<T3>Response: </T3>The fact that the plants and their habitats have alreadyreceived consideration in the environmental impact statement and biologicalassessment has already contributed to an awareness of them among partiesinvolved in that project. However, other interested parties such as theWorld Conservation Centre are notified once a species is listed. Increasingawareness is only one reason for listing. <T3>Issue 5: </T3>The Water District stated that there is not a seriouspresent threat to the Penland beardtongue. <T3>Response: </T3>Off-road vehicle use and mineral exploration are definitethreats to the species. Off-road vehicle damage and mineral explorationhave occurred in the area, and both are a threat to the species' fragilehabitat.<T3>Issue 6: </T3>The County stated that private lands around the reservoirare zoned at the least intensive county zoning designation, Forestry andOpen. <T3>Response: </T3>The Forest and Open zoning does require 20-60 percentopen space in developments, but still allows lodges and cabins to be built.Therefore, surface disturbance of the habitat would still be possible.<T3>Issue 7: </T3>The County stated that both species occur in the PassCreek, Red Dirt Creek, and Troublesome Creek areas. <T3>Response: </T3>All inventories by consultants and the Service throughthe 1988 field season have shown Penland beardtongue to be limited to justthe Troublesome Creek area. The Service has not received any data documentingoccurrences of Penland beardtongue at these other sites. <T3>Issue 8: </T3>The County stated that only marginal habitat at the loweredges of the population would be damaged by inundation and bench sloughing.<T3>Response: </T3>The plant density is naturally lower at the edge ofan occurrence on the sideslopes of draws than at its center on the topof a bench. However, because of the plant's rarity and limited range, theedges of the occurrences are still important to its survival. They representthe potential expansion and enlargement of an occurrence. Also, bench sloughingaround the reservoir would ``eat'' into the benches and hence the centerof the occurrences where the highest densities of plants exist. <T3>Issue 9: </T3>The County stated that past and present grazing impactson the species may have been greater than the effect of a reservoir ona fringe of the population. <T3>Response: </T3>Past grazing, particularly historically high numbersaround the turn of the century, have significantly altered the pristineecological condition of Middle Park. Because the plants grow best in openecological settings with little vegetative competition, and past overgrazinghas caused an increase in big sagebrush density, it is possible that thetwo plants were more common in the pristine habitat. Studies with habitatmanipulation of sagebrush stands have been proposed in the ConservationPlan to test this hypothesis. If it is correct, then this is another factorendangering the plants above and beyond the reservoir and its secondaryimpacts. Current levels of grazing, which are much lower than historiclevels, are probably not further endangering the plants. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Astragalus osterhoutii</T3> and <T3>Penstemon penlandii</T3> should be classified as endangered species.Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act and regulations(50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of theAct were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatenedspecies due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1).These factors and their application to <T3>Astragalus osterhoutii</T3> Jones (Osterhout milk-vetch) and <T3>Penstemon penlandii</T3> Weber (Penland beardtongue) are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or Range<T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> and <T3>P. penlandii</T3> are both naturally rare species. <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> has only one major population along Muddy Creek,with small scattered outlying colonies up to a distance of 6 miles away.<T3>P. penlandii</T3> is known only from one area, with two occurrences2 miles apart along Troublesome Creek/Sulphur Gulch (which is also theeastern most area for <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3>). The badlands on which an estimated 5,000 individualsof <T3>P. penlandii</T3> occur are currently vulnerable to modification fromoff-road vehicle use because of their fragile soils, steep topography,and arid environment. There are dirt roads running through the badlandswhich provide easy access for off-road vehicle use. Off-road vehicle damageand mineral exploration have occurred on the area. The resulting modificationof the habitat could result in a curtailment of the range for Penland beardtongue.The major population of <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> along Muddy Creek has an estimated 25,000 to 50,000plants (personal observation; represents about 90 percent of the totalfor the species) on 132 acres and is threatened by the proposed Muddy CreekReservoir. With construction of the high dam proposal at 7,485 feet elevation,18 acres or 14 percent of the Muddy Creek population would be inundated.An alternative lower dam proposal at 7,475 feet would inundate 10 acresor 8 percent of the population (Bio/West 1988). Also, during flood stagesthere would be a short term rise of 8 to 10 feet in the reservoir levelwhich would inundate an undetermined number of additional plants. Additionaldirect losses from reservoir construction could result from the raisedwater table through perennial soil saturation, and from surface disturbancedue to construction activities such as road building, creation of borrowpits, and heavy equipment movement (Grah and Neese 1987). While directinundation and bench sloughing would destroy habitat at the lower edgesof the population, significant secondary impacts to the benches aroundthe reservoir and along Alkali Slough and Pass Creek could occur with thebuilding of recreation facilities and increased use of the area by peopleand off-road vehicles. The presence of the reservoir would likely stimulateprivate development within the plant's range near the reservoir. Thesepotential secondary impacts would be the same for either dam height andcould cause destruction, modification, or curtailment of Osterhout milk-vetchhabitat or range. Depending upon the degree of future recreational usage, secondary impactsfrom the Muddy Creek Reservoir may be even greater to the Osterhout milk-vetchthan direct impacts from reservoir construction (Grah and Neese 1987).In addition to the direct impacts mentioned above, 80 acres, or 60 percentof the habitat of <T3>A. osterhoutii,</T3> could be threatened by secondary impacts fromrecreational activities associated with the Muddy Creek Reservoir proposal(Bio/West 1988). Proposed mitigation plans to offset direct and secondaryimpacts of the reservoir construction and recreation include managementof the habitat remaining around the reservoir to minimize effects to themilk-vetch; fencing the habitat and designing public recreational facilitiesto minimize the impact on the species; protection of off-site populations;land exchanges; a monitoring program with possible habitat manipulation;and plant surveys for avoidance of the milk-vetch during construction.Mining claims exist along Muddy Creek where the Osterhout milk-vetch occurs.Also, the density of <T3>A. osterhoutii</T3> has been observed to be lower in big sagebrushstands than in the adjacent open benchlands where it normally grows. Itmay be that the past grazing history has caused an increase in big sagebrushcover with a resultant canopy closure and modification of Osterhout milk-vetchhabitat with loss of individuals through lowered densities of populations.B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationPurposes. Taking for these purposes has not been documented. However, both plantshave showy flowers and grow in accessible areas, thus both are vulnerableto collecting and vandalism. C. Disease or Predation No threats are known. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms There are no existing Federal or State laws which protect <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>P. penlandii. </T3>The Act would provide protection and encourage activemanagement through the ``Available Conservation Measures'' discussed below.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>is an obligate outcrossing species (Karron 1989)that requires primarily ground-nesting bumble bees for pollination (Karron1987b). Thus, its pollinators, as well as the plants themselves, couldbe impacted by surface disturbance. Also, a sufficiently large populationsize must be maintained to support pollination by outcrossing. Geneticstudies by Karron <T3>et al </T3>(1988) using starch gel electrophoresis show that <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>is already genetically depauperate, probably dueto small population size. The studies also show that genetic differencesexist between the Muddy Creek population and those east of Kremmling, emphasizingthe need for protection of both sites. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Astragalus osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>Penstemon penlandii </T3>as endangered. Both are restricted endemicsoccurring on a limited habitat, and with only one major population each.<T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>would be impacted directly by construction of theproposed Muddy Creek Reservoir, and secondarily by recreational uses anddevelopment around the reservoir. <T3>P. penlandii </T3>is vulnerable to off-road vehicle damage to its fragilehabitat. There presently exists no opportunity for protection under existinglegislation (State and Federal). For reasons given below, it is not consideredprudent to propose designation of critical habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timethe species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service findsthat designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for thesespecies at this time because no benefit to the species can be identifiedthat would outweigh the potential threat of vandalism or collection, whichmight increase if detailed critical habitat maps are published. Such mapswould identify areas on public and private land, thereby making it moredifficult for Federal enforcement agencies to protect the species. As discussedunder Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' bothplants have showy flowers and grow in accessible areas, thus both are vulnerableto collecting and vandalism. Federal involvement in the areas where theplants occur can be identified without the designation of critical habitat.All involved parties and landowners will be notified of the location andimportance of protecting these species' habitat, and such protection willbe addressed through the recovery process and through section 7 procedures.Therefore, it would not be prudent to determine critical habitat for <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>P. penlandii </T3>at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Actprovides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the Statesand requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species.The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions againstcertain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>P. penlandii </T3>occur primarily on Federal land administered by theBureau. The Bureau's involvement could include section 7 consultation onthe proposed Muddy Creek Reservoir, monitoring the impacts of off-roadvehicle use, and studying the effects of grazing systems on vegetativecomposition. The Army Corps of Engineers would also be involved in anysection 7 consultation for the reservoir because of the need for a 404permit. On both Federal and private land, the Service expects that listingwould elevate the awareness of these plants' status and foster effortsaimed toward their conservation.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 for endangered species set forth a series of general trade prohibitionsand exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitionsof section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. Theseprohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethese species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession these species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition,for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibitthe malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting,digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violationof any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law.Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangeredspecies under certain circumstances. With regard to <T3>A. osterhoutii </T3>and <T3>P. penlandii, </T3>it is anticipated that few, if any, trade permitswould ever be sought or issued because these species are not common incultivation or in the wild.
