The multilayered squabble, replete with insults, a lawsuit and filings at the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington, involves freight charge payments between CSX and Guilford's Maine Central Railroad Co. unit. Also at issue are the financial health of closely held Guilford and the fate of the bankrupt Delaware andamp; Hudson Railway.    &quot;It's an old-fashioned pistol duel between railroads, with the shippers dead center in the line of fire,&quot; says Fred Zitto, manager of U.S. distribution operations of International Paper Co., based in Purchase, N.Y. &quot;We want them to go off and settle it themselves and not hurt us.&quot;    Earlier this month CSX and Guilford filed conflicting tariffs at the ICC. CSX, the Richmond, Va.-based transportation company, said it will stop interchanging freight with the Maine Central effective Aug. 30 unless CSX collects all charges from freight shippers and receivers. Guilford, North Billerica, Mass., then said its Maine Central unit would stop doing business with CSX on the same day unless Guilford collects all payments on shipments between the two railroads.    The tariffs filed by CSX and Guilford are &quot;an obvious effort by the carriers to retaliate against each other,&quot; said James Bartley, executive director of the National Industrial Transportation League. That shipper group and other shippers are vigorously protesting the filings at the ICC, warning that freight shipments between the two railroads would cease if both tariffs are allowed to take effect. By some estimates, 12,700 freight cars a year are transported between CSX and the Maine Central at an average rate of about $2,500 a car. Most of the cars carry paper or paper products from Maine and chemicals or clay from the South to Maine paper mills.    Under normal rail industry practices, the carrier that delivers the freight collects from the shipper and once a month pays intermediate carriers their share of the freight haul. The arrangement particularly benefits smaller railroads such as the 325-mile Maine Central which terminate substantial volumes of freight and are able to control the cash an extra 15 to 45 days.    Officials of CSX, which operates 19,300 route miles, now want to collect all payments from customers shipping between CSX and the Maine Central. That's because they say the Maine Central has failed to make timely settlement of its inter-line balances due CSX. For example, CSX said Maine Central paid the $745,000 owed to CSX last month a week-and-a-half late and then not in the full amount.    CSX is a &quot;financially responsible carrier,&quot; the company said in its ICC filing. But the Maine Central's &quot;financial status is questionable.&quot; Last year CSX began to collect payments from shippers moving freight beween CSX and the Boston andamp; Maine Co., another Guilford rail subsidiary, which CSX said failed to make timely payments in excess of $100,000 to CSX.    Guilford officials bristle at such charges. &quot;It just makes me angry,&quot; said F. Colin Pease, a Guilford vice president, adding that &quot;CSX is an enormous Goliath railroad picking on the Maine Central.&quot;    Mr. Pease said Guilford's rail operations, had first-half net income of $13 million on revenue of about $60 million. The company's first-half earnings include more than $7 million from sale of stock and real estate.    In a suit filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., early this month, Guilford charged CSX with making &quot;false and misleading statements&quot; about Guilford. For example, Guilford said a CSX official told a shipper that Guilford &quot;is not paying and cannot pay its bills and is about to declare bankruptcy.&quot; CSX acknowledged that an official had said that Maine Central was late in making payments to CSX but denied any statements about Guilford's financial health.    Guilford's suit also charged that by seeking to collect payment on shipments to Maine Central destinations CSX threatened to erode Guilford's freight business and profits and impede Guilford's ability to make a bid for the bankrupt Delaware andamp; Hudson Sept. 25. In June 1988 the Delaware andamp; Hudson, then a subsidiary of Guilford, filed for Chapter 11 protection because efforts to reduce the railroad's labor costs collapsed. Guilford said CSX is lending financial and other support to Delaware Otsego Corp., Cooperstown, N.Y., the interim operator of the Delaware andamp; Hudson and a likely bidder for the railroad.    Guilford is no stranger to controversy. In 1986 the company mounted an attack on railroad work rules, but Congress settled a three-month strike at Guilford on terms favorable to labor. Guilford then transferred the Boston andamp; Maine and Maine Central to Springfield Terminal, a subsidiary that has lenient work rules. That maneuver was followed by more labor unrest.    Guilford, owned by Timothy Mellon of the Pittsburgh Mellon family, likes to portray itself as a scrappy railroad willing to fight battles vital to the railroad industry's future that bigger carriers would rather avoid. However, other railroads say Guilford is needlessly confrontational.    Working at Guilford is &quot;like being on the operations deck of an attack destroyer,&quot; said David Fink, chairman of Guilford's rail system. But &quot;CSX is like being on the fantail of Donald Trump's yacht. We're out there toiling in the vineyards, not sunning ourselves.&quot;    A CSX spokeswoman responded, &quot;I can't fathom what he's talking about.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
