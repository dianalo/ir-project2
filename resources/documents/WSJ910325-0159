But much of the violent crime thatis commonplace, especially in the big cities, could beprevented if we redirected public safety policy away fromcontrol of the things criminals misuse -- such as airplanes,beepers, boats, cars, cash and, yes, guns -- and towardcontrol of the criminals themselves.   Bank officials are required to report to the Treasury anycash deposit exceeding $10,000. (They must keep a log onevery currency transaction in amounts between $3,000 and$10,000.) There are more than 20,000 gun-control laws ineffect nationwide. In some communities, beepers are bannedfrom schools or otherwise restricted. Yet convicted, violentcriminals are routinely granted early release, for lack ofprison space.</LP><TEXT>   Focusing on things rather than criminals is a faultystrategy from the start; it defies the logic of supply anddemand. The number of criminals is tiny relative to thesupply of their tools. Surely less than 1% of America'spopulation -- 2.5 million people -- engages in violent crime.But in America there are perhaps 130 million automobiles and150 million firearms. With so abundant a supply, the toolswill always be available to the criminals, despite theimposition even of unimaginably harsh controls that wouldvictimize everyone.   The proximate cause of crime is the tiny minority that isnow free to behave violently. Murderers usually have priorcriminal records, typically involving violent crimes. Between1980 and 1986, persons with records of criminal violenceaccounted for 87% of all murders in Chicago (up from 57% in1970-76). Murder tends to be the culmination of a personalhistory of violent criminal actions -- not the result of alaw-abiding, stable person suddenly going berserk.   The failure of public safety policies based on control ofthings is clearest in regard to firearms. Under the auspicesof the Milwaukee-based Jews for the Preservation of FirearmsOwnership, I have surveyed the Chicago Police Department'sannual &quot;Murder Analysis&quot; reports for 1965 through 1989. Thesereports present detailed, consistent data on murders: theperpetrators, the circumstances, and the means. Allreferences that follow are to these data for Chicago.   The data do not show that control of weapons improvespublic safety. That is, the misuse of handguns to commitmurder varies independently of the incidence of murder. In 19of the 25 years surveyed, the number of handguns used tocommit murder rose more slowly or fell more quickly than didthe number of murders.   Chicago's gun-control measures -- specifically the 1982handgun registration banappear to have ended a strongdowntrend in the misuse of handguns by murderers. In 1973,59.2% of all murders by firearms were committed by peopleusing handguns; this percentage fell to a low of 36.9% in1981. After the 1982 enactment, the downtrend stopped. Thefigure hovered around 40% until 1988, when it rose to 45%.   The firearm most commonly used to commit murder has alwaysbeen the .38-caliber revolver, for decades the policeofficer's standard pistol. Chicago murderers used 9mm and.45-caliber semiautomatic pistols (the most common type)seven times less often than .38-caliber revolvers in the1980s. Yet it is the semiautomatics that gun-controlproponents claim constitute the gravest current threat topublic safety.   The data on rifles and shotguns are even more interesting.Such firearms have been controlled far less tightly thanhandguns. Yet murderers' use of long firearms has fallen fromlow to now negligible levels.   The use of shotguns to commit murder was halved in the1980s, to an annual average of 20 cases. Nearly all the otherlong firearms used to commit murder were .22-caliber rimfirerifles, by far the most commonly owned rifle in America. Inthe 1980s, the .22-caliber rimfire accounted for an annualaverage of 6.5 murders, 0.9% of the total (down from anannual average in the 1970s of 11.2 murders, 1.4% of thetotal).   In no year from 1965 through 1989 were more than 10 riflesother than the .22-caliber rimfire used to commit murder.Indeed, from 1985 through 1989, only seven such rifles wereso used. Of these, only one used a bullet of a size typicalfor a current military-style rifle. Thus, no more that 0.002%of the 3,502 murders from 1985 through 1989 involved riflesother than the .22-caliber rimfire. In only one of thesemurders -- 0.0003% of the total -- was a rifle used thatcould have been a rifle of the type so often targeted bygun-control advocates.   Gun-control measures miss the mark. It is time wediscarded policies that victimize the law-abiding by denyingthem access to things they use properly. We should insteadchampion public safety policies based on containing thecriminal minority. Let us focus on violent criminals -- noton the tools they use.   ---   Mr. Simkin is an international economist in Chicago.
