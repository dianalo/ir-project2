Jefferson Guaranty Bank, Metairie, La., which has assets of $307 million, is to be acquired by Royal Windsor Holding Co., a bank holding company being organized by a group of investors.    The FDIC agreed to make a $57.5 million payment to shore up Jefferson Guaranty's capital and loan-loss reserves in order to make it attractive to private investors. In addition, the new holding company has agreed to contribute $17 million in additional capital.    The additional capital will come from a securities offering being organized by a group of private investors to raise $19 million for Royal Windsor. The group includes James Coleman, a Metairie investor; New York attorney Douglas Hawes, and Peter Del Col and Roy Simpson, both of New York-based Colson Investments.    The FDIC will provide no more assistance to the bank or its new parent and won't assume any of the bank's bad loans. Instead, the agency has told the new owners and managers that it is their responsibility to maintain the bank in sound condition.    The FDIC usually limits its assistance to finding a buyer for a bank once it has failed, but will move to aid a struggling bank if that is less expensive than acting after the institution has failed. </TEXT></DOC>
