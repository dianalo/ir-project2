It made the statement in a letter to holders urging them to reject Brookhurst Partners L.P.'s bid to oust seven Zenith directors and sell the company.    The letter says Zenith, based in Glenview, Ill., is studying consolidating manufacturing activities in North American plants; sourcing of manufacturing and assembly work to Zenith facilities; using common electronics designs to reduce development costs; licensing Zenith technology; and distributing purchased electronics products under the Zenith name.    New York-based Brookhurst began a consent solicitation for its proposals Wednesday. It owns 6.1% of Zenith. </TEXT></DOC>
