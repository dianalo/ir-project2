An East German truck driven by two East Germans pulled up to theguardhouse of Tirstrup airbase in west Denmark Nov. 3 with documentsshowing that the supplies came from neutral Austria, theJyllands-Posten daily said Wednesday.   The materials were for hangers meant to protect NATO warplanesfrom bombers of the Soviet-bloc alliance, the Warsaw Pact.   ``We thought it was an Austrian company that would deliver thematerials. So we were much taken aback when we learned that theorder had gone to an East German firm,'' the paper quoted basecommander Lt. Col. Egon Baek as saying.   The truck was unloaded outside the base, the report said.   A spokesman for the entrepreneur firm WTK, one of the contractersbuilding the 71 reinforced hangars, said the Austrian supplier hadhired the East German transport company.</TEXT></DOC>
