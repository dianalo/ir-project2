Arthur Silverman, 62 years old, pleaded guilty in federal court in Hartford, Conn., to the wire-fraud charge in connection with the 1986 merger of Suffield Savings Bank of Suffield, Conn., and Portland, Maine.-based Coastal Savings Bank. He faces a maximum sentence of as long as five years in jail and a fine of $250,000.    Mr. Silverman, a broker in the Hartford office of what now is Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a unit of New York-based American Express Co., had been indicted on one count each of insider trading, wire fraud and mail fraud.    Neither Mr. Silverman, nor his attorneys, nor Shearson were available for comment last evening.    The indictment charged that Mr. Silverman learned of the secret merger talks from a business associate of Robert C. DiGennaro, then-president of Suffield Savings. Mr. DiGennaro is awaiting trial in federal court in Hartford in another case involving the merger, the U.S. Attorney's office added.    The indictment alleged that Mr. Silverman used the inside information to buy Coastal stock and realized a personal profit of $5,000, as well as commissions from transactions by others. </TEXT></DOC>
