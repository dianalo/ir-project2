The justices are being asked to use the Missouri case tooverturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizingabortion.   The landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, based on a woman'sconstitutional right to privacy, said a woman's decision to have anabortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left toher and her doctor.   The court said states may interfere in the abortion decisionduring the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, andmay take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimesterwhen the fetus can survive outside the womb.   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimesterwas not made absolute, however.   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down asunconstitutional five key provisions of the Missouri law now underscrutiny:   _A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities forperforming abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting an abortion.   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions.   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonablybelieved to be older than 19 weeks is viable, capable of survivingoutside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing.   _A declaration that the ``life of each human begins atconception.''   Here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised infriend-of-the-court briefs submitted to the justices. In all, thecourt received 45 such briefs supporting the Missouri law and 33briefs opposing it.</TEXT><BYLINE>SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE><TEXT>   _From the Bush administration: ``Roe vs. Wade, as the court iswell aware, has been intensely controversial from the day it wasdecided. That controversy is more than simply a reflection of thedeep divisions in American society over the underlying question ofabortion. Rather, the controversy has, in substantial measure, beena product of the decision itself.   ``Roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in theConstitution; it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissiblestate regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy;and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislativebodies in weighing competing social, ethical and scientific factorsin reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation isappropriate in this sensitive area.''   _From the International Right to Life Federation: ``In mostnations of the world, abortion policy has not been the subject ofconstitutional intervention by a high court, remaining determinedby a wide variety of legislative schemes ... The democraticcompromises reached in developed Western nations are significantlymore protective of fetal life than is Roe vs. Wade.''   _From the American Collegians for Life and the Catholic Leaguefor Religious and Civil Rights: ``Under ... Roe, the states have animportant and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life fromconception until birth, which interest becomes compelling atviability.   ``If the states' interest in the protection of fetal lifebecomes compelling at viability, it necessarily follows that thestates possess the ability to require that the point of viabilitybe determined. If the compelling nature of a state's interest inunborn human life ... is to be anything more than illusory, thenRoe and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiringto protect fetal life to require a physician to make adetermination, consistent with sound medical practice, as toviability.''   _From the National Right to Life Committee: ``Abortionjurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil. Thiscourt attempted to resolve the matter in 1973. Time has proven theeffort a failure. This court is now confronted with the opportunityto restore a proper interpretation to the Constitution, returningthis volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora _ thestate legislatures.''   _From Feminists for Life: ``There is ample evidence in themedical studies and public health statistics cited herein that theunfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society bythe court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster theproportion of which we are just beginning to uncover.''   _From Focus on Family and the Family Research Council ofAmerica: ``Changes in understanding and medical science will alwaysoutpace the court's ability to respond. When this court'sprecedents are rooted in science and not in the Constitution, aswas Roe's trimester framework, science is pitted against precedent,and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers.   ``This court can best protect the interests of our citizens byabandoning the trimester approach as outmoded, unscientific andconstitutionally unworkable, and by recognizing that the stateshave legitimate interests, existing throughout pregnancy, inprotecting the life of the mother and the unborn child.''   _From the U.S. Catholic Conference: ``If the court seriouslyseeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line ofprivacy cases, it must reflect accurately that one person's`liberty' is not `license' to control even one's own body whereanother's interest could suffer or the common good be diminished.''   _From the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Associationof Evangelists, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and theChristian Life Commission: ``It has been argued that state lawsprohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religiousbeliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering tothose views, thereby constituting an `establishment' of religionprohibited by the First Amendment.   ``We do not advocate the imposition of our religious views bylaw in order to impose on others our religious beliefs. Rather,those religious beliefs are ... deeply seated in the moral andethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil andcriminal law of this nation ... The fact that a state's lawcoincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render thatlaw unconstitutional under the First Amendment.''</TEXT><BYLINE>OPPOSING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE><TEXT>   _From the American Medical Association and other medical groups:``This court has observed that viability is usually placed at aboutseven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.Since the improvements in health care have resulted in greatersurvival of infants born at a gestational age of 24-28 weeks ...The earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 23-24 weeks.''   ``Thus, while substantial strides have occurred in savinginfants born between 24 and 28 weeks, the earliest point at whichan infant can survive has changed little.   ``What the court found in 1973 is even more true today: themedical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risksof abortion.''   _From 167 scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobellaureates: ``There is no scientific consensus that a human lifebegins at conception, at a given stage of fetal development or atbirth. The question of `when a human life begins' cannot beanswered by reference to scientific principles like those withwhich we predict planetary movement. The answer to that questionwill depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical,ethical and moral beliefs and values.   ``Assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier infetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence.Although advances in technology have improved the chances ofsurvival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, theouter limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed.   ``Roe vs. Wade has not been rendered obsolete by subsequentadvancements in science.''   _From the American Psychological Association: ``Five majorreviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature publishedbetween 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelmingmajority of women who undergo abortion, there are no long-termnegative emotional effects.   ``When women experience regret, depression or guilt, suchfeelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affectinggeneral functioning. Severe emotional responses are rare, even inyoung women. To the contrary, the great majority of women who havehad an abortion express feelings of relief.''   _From the National Association of Public Hospitals: ``Throughits restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose ofperforming or assisting an abortion and on the use of public fundsfor the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion ...Missouri has intruded deeply into the physician-patientrelationship.   ``Missouri's restriction ... has the effect of prohibitingconstitutionally protected conduct, and it is thereforeunconstitutional.''   _From Women (about 3,000) who have had abortions, a compendiumfiled by the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense andEducation Fund and the National Abortion Rights Action League:``Women's privacy and liberty interests ... would be substantiallyinfringed upon by the provisions of the Missouri statute at issue.The option of abortion ... is fundamental to women's lives, libertyand their pursuit of happiness.''   _From 281 American historians: ``At the time the federalConstitution was adopted, abortion was known and not illegal.Abortion was not uncommon in colonial America.   ``A presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justifydenying women their historic liberty to choose abortion.''</TEXT></DOC>
