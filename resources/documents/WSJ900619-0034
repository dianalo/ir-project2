Hesaid the exchange will try to achieve the cutbacks withoutlayoffs.   Mr. Rawlins said the exchange ended the year with a#453,000 ($774,403) pretax profit after rebates to memberfirms. The small surplus &quot;very much reflects the essentiallybreak-even position to which we are aiming the finances ofthe exchange,&quot; he said. After taxes, the exchange swung to a#603,000 loss, compared with an #11.3 million surplus a yearearlier.   Meanwhile, the exchange's chairman, Andrew Hugh Smith,said he plans to meet with counterparts from other EuropeanCommunity exchanges in Brussels on July 3 to discuss recentefforts toward a common informationsharing and stock tradingsystem for Europe.
