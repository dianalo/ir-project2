The surge reflects a growing militancy among shareholders,especially large institutions such as pension funds, which now seeannual meetings as an important forum to confront executives abouttheir ethics and priorities.   ``I think the reason this is growing is because institutionalinvestors in particular have discovered they have responsibilitiesfor their stakeholders, pensioners or others, beyond just gettingas much of a financial return as they can,'' said Diane Bratcher,director of communications for the Interfaith Center on CorporateResponsibility, a New York-based activist church concern.   Some also attribute the shareholder resolution movement to amatured population of baby boomers raised during the antiwarmovement of the 1960s.   Many of these people are now stockholders and stock mutual fundinvestors, looking to put their money to work in ways that conformto their own political and ethical beliefs.   That's led to an explosion in professional investment funds thatuse social concerns as a basis for what securities to buy. Thesefunds have grown from $40 billion in assets a few years ago toabout $400 billion now, securities industry figures show.   ``There are a lot of '60s people who are still around and havethe money to invest,'' said Rosalyn Will, a researcher at theCouncil for Economic Priorities, a New York group that follows theshareholder resolution movement. ``Many have retained those values.Many have kids who have those values, too.''   Others say many corporate executives themselves have begun toencourage shareholder resolutions as part of a strategy to showthey are more sensitive and responsive to the people who own theircompanies.   ``An interesting trend we've seen this year, more and more, isthat companies are realizing how to open a dialogue withinstitutional investors,'' said Robert Amen, a corporate consultantin Greenwich, Conn., who attends and evaluates dozens of annualmeetings.   Three leading management consulting firms, Ernst andamp; Whinney,Touche Ross andamp; Co., and Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells, have startedpublishing special booklets for executives on how to answershareholder queries at annual meetings, especially in an era ofeconomic uncertainty and growing questions about business ethics.   ``Company directors and officials prepared for the 1989 annualstockholders meetings will be responding to investors who areconcerned about not only the potential impact of results onindividual share prices but also the way companies are being run,''Deloitte says in its booklet.   The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-basedgroup that monitors corporate behavior, says a record 176shareholder resolutions on sensitive issues will be voted on duringthis annual meeting season, which generally runs from mid-Aprilthrough early June.   That compares with 156 introduced in 1988, 108 in 1980 and 40 in1973.   Shareholder activists say the catalyst clearly has been theeffort aimed at compelling U.S. corporations to vacate South Africabecause of its white-minority government's systematic suppressionof the black majority.   Although many South Africa divestment resolutions have beenroutinely defeated at annual meetings, their sponsors say merediscussion of the issue has raised management awareness and hasplayed a role in the departure of more than 140 U.S. companies fromthat country since 1984.   Moreover, sponsors of South African resolutions have beengaining an increasing number of yes-votes at annual meetings,forcing companies to reintroduce the resolutions the followingyear. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules on publiclytraded companies, shareholder resolutions receiving at least 3percent approval the first year they are introduced must be on thenext annual meeting's agenda.   Ms. Bracher, whose group has been a leading proponent of SouthAfrican divestment, said the success of the movement has inspiredother socially active investor groups to start their own campaigns.   She said the fastest growing efforts target U.S. divestment inBritish-ruled Northern Ireland and fair employment practices byU.S. multinationals operating in Third-World countries.   Aerospace giant Lockheed Corp., for example, has been targetedby the pension fund managers of New York public employees over thefair-hiring practices of the company's subcontractors in NorthernIreland.   Figgie International, a Richmond, Va.-based concern that makesprofessional sports equipment, has been targeted by church-activistgroups over allegations of abysmal working conditions at itsbaseball factory in Haiti.   Animal rights, long an issue raised by picketers at annualmeetings, has become an agenda item as well. This year,shareholders in at least 10 U.S. companies will be voting onresolutions proposed by animal rights activists.   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Washington lobbygroup, has introduced shareholder resolutions on laboratory testingat the annual meetings of American Home Products Corp.,Bristol-Myers Co., Colgate-Palmolive Inc. and the Gillete Co.,among others.   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animalsasked that McDonald's Corp. investigate the effect on animals offactory farming, the mass production of chickens, cows and pigsslaughtered for food. The ASPCA withdrew the resolution afterMcDonald's agreed to conduct a study.   Elsewhere, the Federation of American Scientists has introducedshareholder resolutions at BankAmerica, Citicorp and ManufacturersHanover, three of Latin America's biggest creditors, requestingthem to persuade debtors Brazil and Argentina not to developnuclear weapons.   Other shareholder issues on the agenda this season include humanrights in Chile; nuclear reactor safety; antibiotic-fed poultry;Third World debt; and contributions to political action committees.   William Morley, chief counsel for the SEC's division ofcorporate finance, said he's noticed a growing sophistication byshareholder activists who want to get resolutions on meetingagendas.   They know, for example, what eligibility rules are from state tostate, when to submit proposals to companies and how to seek SECassistance if they think a company has unfairly blocked a proposalfrom consideration.   ``A lot of social issue people have been writing them foryears,'' Morley said. ``But each time you go through a season youget new groups involved, and they have a better idea of how youjump through the hoops.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday, April 24</NOTE></DOC>
