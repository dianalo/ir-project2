The law, which amends the Texas Open Records Act, allowsgovernment agencies to keep confidential the identities of victimsof felonies, including homicide.   Police also can withhold information that could lead to victims'identification, such as addresses. The bill went into effect June 14.   Generally, the news media voluntarily withholds the names only ofvictims of sex crimes.   One of the sponsors, Rep. Fred Blair, said the bill was aimed atprotecting crime victims from harassment, whether by reporters'questions or from other sources, such as security companies. He saidvictims or their families could release the information, but itotherwise would not be public unless it reached the courts.   ``A lot of crimes go unreported because the victims just don'twant to go through it,'' Blair said. ``I was thinking about thevictims. I wasn't thinking about anybody else.''   ``I think the law is outrageous and I hope law enforcementagencies will choose to ignore it until this serious challenge tofreedom of information can be corrected,'' Jack Loftis, editor andvice president of the Houston Chronicle, said in a telephoneinterview Tuesday.   The Chronicle waged a lengthy court battle in recent years toobtain records from the Houston Police Department.   In Amarillo, reporters and editors said that authorities wouldnot release the names of people involved in a fatal car accidentlast weekend because of the law.   ``If I hadn't been familiar with the case already, I would havebeen out of luck,'' said John Hagerty of KFDA-TV. ``It really tiesour hands.''   Dennis Spies, managing editor of the Amarillo Daily News, saidhis reporters encountered similar problems with police, who refusedto give the name of the woman killed in the accident because asuspected drunken driver was charged with involuntary manslaughter,a felony.   The paper finally got the names of the woman and her criticallyinjured husband from a funeral home, Spies said.   Spies also said police refused to disclose the names of fivepeople injured in a knife fight at an Amarillo nightclub Monday.   ``I'm sure (lawmakers) had good intentions,'' Spies said. ``Butit's not helping our readers any ... it affects everybody.''   Blair said he believes some law enforcement agencies aremisinterpreting the law's intent and that authorities should be moreliberal in releasing such information.   ``There is so much misinformation on the bill. Variousdepartments are still studying it,'' Blair said. Departments thatare withholding information ``have already just across-the-board,broadly interpreted using the bill that way.''   Blair said that, under the House counsel's interpretation, thenames of the crash victims should have been released by authorities.   Police spokesmen in Austin and San Antonio have said they arestudying the law before changing any policies. In Midland, DeputyChief John Smith said police were not aware of it.   The Texas Department of Public Safety, which asked for a stateattorney general's interpretation of the law, told troopers towithhold the names of people killed or injured in drunken-drivingaccidents, said spokesman Mike Cox.   Ira Perry, regional director of the Society of ProfessionalJournalists, said he expected several media groups to fight themeasure.   ``We're getting calls from everywhere, either about problems orfrom news media saying, `what is going on here?''' said SharonJayson, chairwoman of Texas Media, a freedom-of-information lobbyfor several statewide news associations. She said the group Tuesdaywas discussing how to respond to the law.   Gov. Bill Clements said Tuesday that if asked, he'll considerputting the issue on the agenda of the special legislative sessionthat began last week.   ``Certainly, (Clements) realized what he was signing, but ...there was no opposition voiced'' during the bill's journey throughthe House and Senate, said Rossanna Salazar, the governor's deputypress secretary.</TEXT></DOC>
