This &quot;below regulatory concern&quot; approach is designed togive the commissioners a uniform framework for grantingblanket exemptions covering such activities as thedecontamination of nuclear power plants, and such materialsas consumer products and low-level radioactive waste.</LP><TEXT>   In the past, the commission has granted exemptions on acase-by-case basis to a few products. The NRC contends thatallowing for blanket exemptions will enable it to focus itsresources on more-serious risks.   Consumer and environmental groups attacked the change,saying it will result in excessive radiation exposure toindividuals and increase cancer deaths.   Under the new policy, a material or practice can beconsidered for exemption if it will result in an averageradiation dose to an individual of less than 10 millirems ayear. By comparison, a single round-trip cross-countryairline trip exposes an individual to about five millirems ofradiation, the NRC said.   For consumer products or recycled materials, the dosecouldn't be above one millirem a year.</TEXT></DOC>
