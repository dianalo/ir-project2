We consider those values of the magneticfield for which the parameter andless;fandgt; that measures the average flux throughan elementary plaquette in units of the flux quantum is integral. Forandless;fandgt; = 1 and andless;fandgt; = 3, we find Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase transitionfrom a normal to a superconducting phase. For andless;fandgt; = 5 and andless;fandgt; = 7, theresults suggest a spin-glass-like freezing over the time scales of thesimulations. We do not find any evidence for a low-temperature reentranttransition for any value of andless;fandgt;.</TEXT></DOC>
