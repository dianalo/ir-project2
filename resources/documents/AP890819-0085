The effort comes in response to a weighty problem: a modern Navywarship carries 15 to 25 tons of operating, maintenance and repairmanuals; the B-1B bomber has generated 1 million pages of how-todocumentation.   The Pentagon says the campaign could reduce the lifetime cost ofmajor weapons by up to 20 percent by converting masses of printedtechnical information into computerized databases.   The cost for technical data delivered with military hardwareranges from 10 percent to 30 percent of the total weapon systemprice tag. Add to that the millions of dollars that must be spent,year after year, to keep the manuals up to date.   To spearhead the conversion of printed data to electronic form,the Defense Department in September 1985 launched a program calledComputer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support, or CALS.   Bruce Lepisto, deputy director of the Pentagon's CALS PolicyOffice, said each of the military services has selected particularweapons to lead the way in carrying out the computerization effort.   For the Air Force, he said, these lead systems are the AdvancedTactical Fighter and the B-2 Stealth bomber; for the Navy, the A-12attack aircraft and SSN-21 Seawolf class attack submarine; and forthe Army, the LHX helicopter and M1-A2 tank.   Lepisto acknowledged that there had been some problem weaningmilitary personnel as well as defense contractors from reliance ontraditional paper documents.   ``We're talking about a major cultural change here,'' he said.``Some people are overly anxious and want to rush in. And somepeople feel that better is the enemy of good enough. What we'reimplementing is a new way of doing business. And certainly there aregoing to be people that want to go either faster or slower.''   Paul N. Pechersky, co-chairman of the CALS Industry SteeringGroup, representing hundreds of defense contractors, said, ``We'restill in the very early stages. This is a massive undertaking. Frommy own personal perspective, I think we're doing very well.''   ``The first several years have been devoted to trying to get ouract together _ to decide what we want to do and how we want to doit. And more importantly, to try and get agreement on some of theearly digital (information) exchange standards that have to be putin place,'' he said.   Pechersky, corporate director of management information systemsfor E-Systems Inc. in Dallas, said the program is ``evolutionary,not revolutionary. We'll see various implementations of CALS wellinto the year 2000.''   The CALS program involves development of standardized text andimage formats so that electronic data can be readily exchangedbetween a wide variety of different computer systems within themilitary and at defense contractors.   The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, a publishing industrynewsletter based in Media, Pa., has forecast that CALS eventuallywill have a major impact spreading far beyond the defense industry.   Peter Dyson, associate editor of the newsletter, observed that``the Defense Department handles so much printing and so muchelectronic information that they are the classic 800-pound gorilla.Whatever they do sets a standard.''   ``Every aspect of the publishing industry is coming to grips withthis electronic dissemination of information,'' he said. ``Andthey're sort of mucking around, not quite knowing how to do it,because it's still a difficult technology.   ``What the Defense Department has done is simply issued a fiat,`This is how you shall do it.' Having said so, they're going to makeit so. Large other chunks of the industry are going to go that waysimply because the vendors of electronic systems will have alreadywritten the software to do it for DoD,'' Dyson said.</TEXT></DOC>
