On a 35-13 margin, the panel rejected efforts to continue providing arms assistance to the guerrillas, in an action that represents a warning to the White House not to press the issue while the Central American peace process continues.    An estimated $3.5 million is expected to be attached to the bill on the floor next week to pay for food and nonlethal aid to sustain the Contra forces. But the bipartisan leadership in the House has no appetite for a vote on military aid before Nov. 7, when the peace plan is scheduled to take effect.    &quot;Nobody wants a bloody, knockdown fight right now,&quot; said House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, reflecting the mood in meetings with Democrats, who appear anxious as well to sidestep any immediate confrontation.    New York Rep. Jack Kemp, a Republican conservative and candidate for president, was relatively isolated in the committee yesterday. His amendment to continue military funds for the Contras won no Democratic votes while losing senior moderates in his own party.    The postponement of action on military aid also means the issue is likely to be addressed after the release of the final report next month of the House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Investigators are continuing to pursue evidence that the diversion of funds from U.S. arms sales to Iran was planned weeks before January 1986, when President Reagan authorized the weapons transactions.    A draft of the narrative portion of the report, comprising nearly 1,000 pages, was made available yesterday to members of the investigative committees. In weighing the evidence, a major issue will be when the diversion was planned in the National Security Council and whether it became a driving force behind the decision to sell arms to Iran.    The spending resolution approved yesterday is required because Congress has yet to enact any of the annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1988. The measure would fund most accounts at their current level, but foreign aid programs would be squeezed in an effort to stay within Congress's fiscal 1988 budget resolution. Foreign economic aid programs would be most affected, and though the cut is regarded as only temporary, it would translate into an annual reduction of nearly $1 billion.    The House action yesterday came as the Senate Appropriations Committee approved more than $15 billion in fiscal 1988 spending for the Treasury Department, Postal Service and various independent agencies.    Postal subsidies would be cut to $517 million, an estimated 20% reduction from this year but still far more than the $71.8 million allocated in President Reagan's budget. Nearly $5 billion would be appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service, or slightly below the administration's request, and the Senate bill would provide significant new funding for the Customs Service in an effort to improve its commercial operations, particularly on the Southwest border.    The initiative reflects the combined power of Sens. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) who oversee the Customs budget, and the pressure of importers, particularly after the imposition of a Customs user fee this year.    The Senate bill anticipates the hiring of more than 1,700 new workers as part of a 17% increase in the Customs budget. And elsewhere, the same Southwestern interests won $83.5 million to improve U.S. border facilities in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. </TEXT></DOC>
