The $4.5 billion River Bend nuclear project, which went into commercial operation in June 1986, is 70% owned by cash-strapped Gulf States of Beaumont, Texas.    The decision was characterized as &quot;devastating&quot; by Gulf States, which operates in the petrochemical corridor of south Texas and Louisiana. The action, in the longest utility rate case in Texas history, didn't include a decision on a Gulf States request for $144 million in permanent rate increases.    Unlike a similar decision in Louisiana, the $1.45 billion in costs isn't a permanent exclusion from future rate increase requests. Using a regulatory tool known as the prudency probe, commissioners voted that only $1.6 billion in costs had been prudently or efficiently incurred. Commissioners said Gulf States failed to show the remaining costs were prudent, leaving the utility the option of again arguing its case at a rehearing or in another rate-increase case.    Gulf States said it will submit a report on Monday on the financial impact of the $1.45 billion exclusion. Commissioners also voted to give Gulf States a 13% rate of return on equity; the commission's hearing examiners had recommended 15.25%.    These two actions, along with a potentially smaller-than-requested rate increase, could result in Gulf States actually giving its customers rate rebates, a Gulf States spokeswoman said. &quot;We are very disappointed and very concerned,&quot; said the utility spokeswoman.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gulf States' stock closed at $5.875, down 37.5 cents.    Last week, the stock was buoyed when a Louisiana district judge granted Gulf States a $92 million rate increase, nearly $30 million more than Louisiana regulators had previously ruled was adequate. Additionally, the Louisiana judge gave Gulf States a 14% rate of return on equity, up from 12%. The judge, who took the case on appeal from Gulf States, hasn't ruled yet on a $1.4 billion permanent exclusion from Louisiana regulators. Wall Street analysts said the $1.4 billion penalty for inefficient management in the Louisiana case is the largest ever given to a utility. </TEXT></DOC>
