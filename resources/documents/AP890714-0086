JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The prominence given to the environment at theParis economic summit reflects a growing view among world leadersthat the battle against pollution is too immense and complicated fora single nation to tackle.   President Bush and his advisers are expected to argue forcefullythat unless a resounding effort is made to enlist all countries, themoves to cut pollution by a few nations could be wiped out byactions taken _ or not taken _ elsewhere in the world.   So leaders of the seven largest industrial nations _ the UnitedStates, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _want to conclude their meeting Sunday with a unified voice that willcarry weight among leaders not present.   The summit participants are aware that the environment has becomea hot political issue. Repeated polls indicate that people wanttheir leaders to tackle the world's pollution problems.   At the same time, the Bush administration sees the environment asa way for the United States to extend a new form of leadership inthe sometimes troubled Western alliance as well as becoming theconduit toward closer East-West ties in the coming years.   ``Our shared heritage is the Earth,'' President Bush said duringhis stay in Hungary. ``And the fate of the Earth transcends borders.It is not just an East-West issue.''   Dozens of international conferences have been held or arescheduled for the next few years to deal with global warming, thedecay of the protective stratospheric ozone layer, dirty urban air,and oceans contaminated with everything from medical wastes tosprawling oil spills.   All of these topics will be the focus of debate at the economicsummit today through Sunday in Paris. The environment is coming onlike ``a freight train'' as an international issue, Bush has said.   His chief environmental spokesman, William Reilly, head of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, complained recently that some ofthe conference participants may be trying to move too quickly.   ``There is something of a race on by some of the economic summitparticipants ... to be the greenest of all on this issue,'' saidReilly, the first EPA administrator ever to attend an economicsummit. ``Restoring the environment is not a sprinter's game; it'sgoing to require steady, long-term commitments.''   The Bush administration, however, has been criticized by someenvironmentalists for being too slow in asserting U.S. leadership ondealing with the growing global environmental mess.   Earlier this year the United States dragged behind in calling fora ban on the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which areblamed for depleting the ozone layer. The United States announcedsupport for a ban only after European nations did.   The administration also waited until the last minute beforecalling for an international workshop on global warming and then didso after critics charged the president was backing away from acampaign pledge to host such a conference. The workshop was to beheld in Washington, but now is planned for Geneva in October,although Reilly insists the United States will remain its ``host.''   The seven nations at the summit use about 60 percent of theworld's ozone-depleting CFCs and account for about 40 percent of theworld's carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels,the principal culprit in global warming.   ``You wouldn't launch a Marshall Plan at an economic summit,''Reilly quipped to reporters recently while reviewing hisexpectations of the Paris meeting, the 15th such summit and thefirst in which the environment has held this much attention.</TEXT></DOC>
