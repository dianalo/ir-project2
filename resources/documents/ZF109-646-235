Riggs, Adam E.andO;Grant and Franklin E. Darden, Jr.andP;  on November 16 for activities involvingillegal access to computer systems of BellSouth, Assistant United StatesAttorney for the Northern District of Georgia Kent B. Alexander has releasedthe &quot;Government's Sentencing Memorandum And S.G.andP;  andamp; 5K1.1 Motion&quot;.andM;This 21 page document, prepared by Joe D. Whitney, United States Attorney forthe Northern District of Georgia, and Alexander and sent to United StatesDistrict Court Judge J. Owen Forrester, puts forth the factors which theprosecuting attorneys wish the judge to consider in determining sentence.andM;The memorandum states: &quot;Although the government is going to recommend adownward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, the three defendants areclearly criminals who have caused a significant amount of damage and shouldbe punished accordingly.andP;  Moreover, the computer hacker world is watchingthis case very closely, and the Court should send a message that illegalcomputer activities will not be tolerated.&quot; (The word &quot;hacker&quot; is footnotedand explained by saying, &quot;The government uses the term 'hacker' to describe aperson who uses computers for criminal activity.andP;  The Court should note,however, that the term 'hacker' can also be used to describe legitimatecomputer users.andP;  At one time all computer users were known as 'hackers' andsome computer users still identify themselves as 'hackers'.&quot;)andM;In explaining the gravity of the crimes, the memorandum states  &quot;In all, theystole approximately $233,800 worth of logins/passwords and connect addresses(i.e.andP;  access information) from BellSouth.andP;  BellSouth spent approximately$1.5 million in identifying the intruders into their system and has sincespent roughly $3 million  more to further secure their network.&quot;andM;In explaining the perceived need to send a message to the  &quot;hackercommunity,&quot; the memorandum points out that the last  federally prosecutedadult criminal hacker, Robert Morris,  Jr.andP;  received probation and that thatsentence was followed  very closely by &quot;hackers&quot; throughout the nation.andP;  The memorandum states: &quot;Any sentence that does not include  incarceration wouldsend the wrong message to the hacking  community; that is, that breaking intocomputer systems is  not really a crime.&quot;andM;The document also states that &quot;All three defendants have  providedsignificant cooperation that has fueled further  investigation into theactivities of a number of computer  hackers throughout the country.&quot; Becauseof this  cooperation, the &quot;government moves for this Court to make a downward departure pursuant to S.G.andP;  5k1.1 in the amount of three levels fordefendants Grant and Darden and two levels  for defendant Riggs.&quot; Thememorandum then details the  cooperation of each of these defendants in casesinvolving  Craig Neidorf in Chicago and an unnamed &quot;fellow Legion of  Doommember&quot; in Detroit.andP;  The memorandum also explains why a  lesser departure isrecommended for Riggs - &quot;Defendant Riggs strikes the undersigned counsel asan unusually quiet  and pensive person.andP;  Throughout the investigation, he hasbeen cooperative, but because of his nature, he sometimes  comes across asuninterested and evasive.andP;  The bottom line  is that he provided helpfulinformation that furthered several investigations around the country, thoughhis  assistance was not as substantial as that of Grant and  Darden; hencethe recommendation of only a two-level  departure.&quot; An earlier conviction forRiggs related to computer fraud was also mentioned.andM;In the actual sentencing by Judge Forrester, Grant and  Darden received 14months incarceration of which 7 will be  in a half-way house  while Riggsreceived 21 months incarceration .andP;  Additionally, they were directed to make restitution payments to BellSouth of $233,000.andM;In a conversation with Newsbytes, the aforementioned Craig Neidorf questionedthe determination of damages in the case, saying &quot;I hope that the damagesclaimed by BellSouth have been well scrutinized by the government.andP;  You mayremember that, before the charges against me were dismissed, BellSouth hadclaimed that the value of the document in question was over $70,000.andP;  Itturned out that the document was available in print for under $20.andP;  Riggs,Darden and Grant had already pleaded guilty when this gross overstatementcame out.andP;  I hope, for justice's sake, that the restitution awarded actuallyrelates to substantiated damages.&quot; An examination of the sentencingmemorandum finds that the E911 file, &quot;the subject of the Chicago indictment&quot;was estimated by Bob Kibler of BellSouth Security to be valued, based on Randamp;Dcosts, at $24,639.andM;Kent Alexander, Assistant U.S.andP;  Attorney, told Newsbytes that he &quot;iscomfortable with the method under which the damages were determined.&quot; He alsoclarified the order for restitution, saying that Riggs, Darden and Grant arejointly responsible for the $233,000 and that each of them is individuallyliable for the entire amount should the others default in payment.andM;The Department of Justice release also stated: &quot;The United  States Attorneycommented that most computer users engage  in legal and constructiveactivities.andP;  Criminal hackers,  however, who break into computer systems ofothers, are  breaking the law and will be prosecuted accordingly.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
