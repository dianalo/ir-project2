The Transportation Department last month offered airlines operating at 13 busy airports antitrust immunity in an effort to encourage them to &quot;debunch&quot; their schedules at peak hours and reduce delays.    The offer required that any airline request the immunity, which Dallas-based AMR Corp.'s American Airlines subsequently did. The talks are likely to go forward after the department formally grants the immunity, despite widespread industry grumbling that the idea won't solve the problem. Industry officials believe the meetings may begin here as early as March 9.    &quot;Granting carriers immunity to conduct scheduling discussions poses significant risks to competition,&quot; Charles Rule, acting assistant attorney general, said in a letter to Matthew Scocozza, assistant transportation secretary for policy. Mr. Rule said the plan &quot;appears inappropriate here, where it is not at all clear that scheduling agreements among carriers have eliminated delays in the past or that they would do so in the future.&quot;    Besides the Justice Department, the White House Office of Management and Budget strongly opposes the Transportation Department plan. But neither agency has the authority to block it. Even American Airlines couched its request for antitrust immunity in terms that underscore its coolness to the plan.    The talks, American said, &quot;can only be a temporary and partial attempt to remedy flight delays.&quot; The carrier said the real problem was the air-traffic control system's inability to handle the growth in traffic.    But Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole contends that juggling airline schedules could substantially alleviate delays, which affected an average of 1,144 flights a day last year, up from 915 in 1985. In an appearance before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation yesterday, she noted that the airlines wouldn't be permitted to discuss prices or other matters besides scheduling.    In his letter, however, the Justice Department's Mr. Rule said that changes in airline schedules could raise prices by reducing capacity during peak hours. He also argued that granting airlines antitrust immunity should be used &quot;only as a last resort.&quot; First, he said, any airlines that knowingly schedule more flights than an airport can handle should be penalized by the Transportation Department for misleading consumers. He added that airlines perhaps should be required to provide information about their delay records to passengers.    But a high-ranking Transportation Department official contended that requiring airlines to disclose their delay records would be far more burdensome than the voluntary adjustment of airline schedules. The department already has begun probing carriers for possible misrepresentation of schedules.    The official also strongly disputed Mr. Rule's assertion that prices would rise if flights were spaced out. Spacing out flights would involve a matter of minutes, not hours, he said, and thus wouldn't decrease service or raise prices.    Industry officials contend that delays are caused by various factors, ranging from an inadequate number of air-traffic controllers and outdated facilities to such things as mechanical problems and food-service snafus.    Many in the industry believe, however, that they have little choice but to go along with the talks. Some fear that if delays aren't reduced, the Transportation Department will increase the number of airports that have a cap on flight operations -- even though Secretary Dole told the House panel yesterday that the department isn't &quot;anywhere near&quot; expanding such traffic limits beyond the four airports to which they currently apply.    Moreover, industry officials and Transportation Department officials are worried that unless something is done, the delays for this summer's travel season will be nightmarish. </TEXT></DOC>
