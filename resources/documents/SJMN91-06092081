Cityofficials in this neatly manicured Miami suburb did just that, confiscatingthe sidewalk racks and 400 copies of a regular critic, the weekly newspaperNew Times.;    The boxes and papers were removed from the street corners thesame day last month that the paper skewered city government for its multitudeof laws regulating everything from conduct in swimming pools on Sundaymornings to the color of house paint.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NEWSPAPER'S RACKS REMOVED IN TOWN IT BAD-MOUTHS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     In its story, New Times exposed a minor scandal involving a secret -- andnow fizzled -- plan to build a wall around the city's public golf course. ToNew Times, this was another spasm of compulsive neatness. Hours after thepaper hit the streets, seven New Times sidewalk boxes and their contents werehauled away.;    City officials said the New Times news racks violated one ofthe municipality's numerous ordinances, and that the newspaper can return whenit complies. But at the offices of the struggling weekly, which is distributedonly on the streets, the action seemed like revenge.;    Coral Gables, knownlocally as the &quot;City Beautiful,&quot; is one of Miami's lusher suburbs. It iszealous about maintaining order amid a chaotic metropolis where evensubtropical fauna seems to grow wildly out of control.;    In Coral Gableslife follows certain predictable patterns. The streets are lined with matchingtrees. Houses are painted in color-coordinated pastels.;    Laws prohibitswimming in private pools near churches on Sunday mornings. Cats are requiredto wear bells audible within 50 feet. A cat caught killing a bird must beexecuted by police.;    When New Times, an alternative newspaper that coversthe Miami area, began publishing four years ago, the editors found CoralGables an irresistible target. The paper came up with new monikers: the &quot;CityDutiful,&quot; the &quot;City Anal Retentive,&quot; and &quot;Moral Gables.&quot;;    Explaining theirdecision to build a wall around the golf course, city officials said theywanted to keep hoodlums from hot rodding across the greens in the middle ofthe night. New Times used the plan as another reason to mock city officials.;   So it wasn't surprising that New Times newspaper boxes disappeared from thestreets. It seems the New Times violated chapter 28, section VI of the citycode, which requires all sidewalk newspaper boxes to be uniform gloss brownwith the newspaper's name stenciled on the side in letters no wider than 1 3/4inches.;    New Times lawyers last week challenged the city's newspaper boxordinance on First Amendment grounds. They reached a temporary truce while thebattle is waged in court: The original boxes will be allowed back on thestreets, unless the City Beautiful ultimately prevails.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Coral Gables, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910401  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  453  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 1, 199100092081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
