 GAO said the upgrade should be assessed inlight of several factors, including the continuing corporate informationmanagement (CIM) plan to consolidate like applications.andM;Although members of the MAISRC acknowledged that a CIM effort for militarypersonnel is forthcoming and that the Army should keep consolidationprospects in mind, the MAISRC did not fully stop SIDPERS-3, according toservice officials.andM;&quot;The MAISRC likes our approach to the database part of the program and gaveus the go-ahead on that and some limited applications software to go alongwith it,&quot; said Anthony Valletta, the Army's program executive officermanaging SIDPERS and other applications upgrades.andM;The MAISRC did instruct the Army to limit software development, Vallettasaid.andP;  In the SIDPERS upgrade, the Army is attempting to convert itsfield-level administrative personnel system, SIDPERS-2.75, from otherlanguages to Ada.andM;&quot;The MAISRC wants more information on Ada,&quot; Valletta said.andP;  He said theMAISRC asked the Army to answer questions about Ada that also were raised byGAO and to produce a more detailed economic analysis for SIDPERS-3.andM;GAO said the Army so far has paid $6 million for Ada conversion work that isbeing done by a contracting team lead by Statistica Inc. of Rockville, Md.andM;Life cycle cost estimates for SIDPERS have bounced around over the years,from a high of $1 billion to less than $200 million.andP;  GAO complained that theArmy's current $151 million estimate does not include new hardwarerequirements that auditors put at $102 million.andM;GAO said the Army has not proven Ada &quot;promises to be the most economicalchoice&quot; for SIDPERS or that a standard method of interfacing Ada andStructured Query Language exists.andM;Valletta said the Army is confident that GAO's questions can besatisfactorily answered.andP;  But the close timing between delivery of the reportand the MAISRC review at which those questions were aired made preparationdifficult.andM;&quot;Since the GAO conducted its study, industry has made significant technicaladvances in the Ada-SQL binding area and we are confident ourgovernment-contractor team will deliver the product,&quot; he said.andM;Valletta and other officials have said in previous interviews that manyAda-SQL problems were solved during the rewrite of the Army's StandardFinancial System Redesign (STANFINS) into Ada.andP;  That effort involved 2million lines of code and 4,000 separately compiled programs.andM;Before the SIDPERS contract award last year, the Army's Information SystemsEngineering Command used an Ada compiler from Compass Inc. of Wakefield,Mass., to bind a test section of the system with SQL across all three ADPtiers of the Army's operating system architecture, MVS on mainframes, Unix onminicomputers and MS-DOS on micros.andP;  The SIDPERS contracting team recentlyproduced a prototype section of the personnel system that runs at the PClevel, an official said.andM;Members of both the contracting team and the Army's Personnel InformationSystems Command have said SIDPERS is being written to run on an enhanced386-based version of the Tactical Army Combat Service Support Computer System(TACCS), the multipurpose battlefield computers supplied by Unisys Corp.andM;When Statistica won the SIDPERS last year, contractor and Army officials saidthe upgraded system would run on their fleet of 186-based TACCS computers.andO;However, the unenhanced TACCS does not have enough processing power or datastorage capacity, one official said.andM;Officials have said the Ada code can be ported to other Army computers, suchas the Common Hardware/Software suite of battlefield machines supplied byMiltope Corp.andP;  Those machines someday will replace most TACCS computers.andM;GAO made its report, Army Automation: Decisions Needed on SIDPERS-3 BeforeFurther Development, to the House Government Operations Committee.andO;Congressional concerns about SIDPERS first surfaced last year after thecontract went to Statistica.andP;  At that time, the House Appropriations DefenseSubcommittee asked Army officials why they had not submitted their plans tothe MAISRC.andM;The Army countered that its cost estimate then was about $80 million, whichput SIDPERS beneath the scope of the MAISRC's attention.andP;  The subcommittee,however, contended costs could soar to $1 billion.andP;  Although they disagreedwith the high estimate, Army officials late last year submitted SIDPERS toMAISRC review as an item of special interest.andM;Under the CIM plan, DOD has targeted seven administrative areas forconsolidated systems development after teams of specialists completefunctional requirements for the three services and defense agencies.andM;The MAISRC is chaired by the comptroller, Sean O'Keefe, who also oversees theCIM plan.andP;  With military personnel systems soon to be subjected to CIMconsolidation, a decision to allow the Army to proceed fully with the SIDPERSredesign might be read as a sign that all the services someday will be servedby the Ada system.andM;However, GAO said the Army should restudy the possibility of adopting theMarine Corps' personnel system before proceeding with SIDPERS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
