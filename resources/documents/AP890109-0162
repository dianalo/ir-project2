Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci asked Congress to boost defensespending by an inflation-adjusted 2 percent for the next two yearsin the draft military budget. He proposed $315.2 billion in budgetauthority for 1990, and $330.89 billion for 1991.   The spending plans, however, will likely be modified after GeorgeBush assumes the presidency.   There has been growing criticism in the U.S. Congress in recentyears that America's allies in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization are not shouldering enough of the burden of financing acommon defense. NATO defense ministers in December released a reporton the ``burden-sharing'' issue and faulted some in the 16-nationWestern alliance for not doing enough.   In the late 1970s, the United States began pressing for aninflation-adjusted 3 percent annual increase in each country'sdefense spending, a sum that has become a rough guideline formeasuring military expenditures.   Martin McCusker, director of the military committee of the NorthAtlantic Assembly, said the draft budget plan ``will certainly bluntthe argument that some will make now _ that some Europeans are noteven keeping up with the minimum 3 percent.''   ``It will show the United States is not reaching that leveleither,'' he said. The assembly is made up of legislators whorepresent the NATO countries.   A spokesman for the U.S. mission to NATO said, ``Budgetaryconstraints have required the proposal for only a 2 percentincrease.''   ``Given the long-standing burden-sharing issue, the United Stateswould nonetheless hope that those countries which have not met pastgoals would not use this as an excuse for lowering their budgetprojections,'' said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity.   The NATO report on burden-sharing said that on average in thepast decade, Canada, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Turkey,Britain and the United States generally met the 3 percent goal.   Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Greece posted the smallest averagegrowth levels, it said.   ``Although some countries have improved performance in the lastfive years (Canada, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey andthe United States), performance in general has been somewhat lesssuccessful and this downward trend generally seems set tocontinue,'' it said.   Binnendijk said that although Carlucci wants a 2 percent pickupin military spending, ``the reality is they are not going to get anyreal increase.''   ``Because of the budget constraints on Capitol Hill ... the bestthe Pentagon can hope for is a straight line in real terms. Growthof 2 percent is highly unlikely,'' he said.   Indeed, Congress has trimmed the Pentagon's wish list in recentyears.   It approved a 1.3 percent inflation-adjusted decrease in budgetauthority in the current 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Theadministration had presented a budget proposal of $299.5 billionunder a compromise money plan worked out with Congress. Thatproposed spending level was not large enough to offset inflation.   Congressionally approved budget authority was off 2 percent in1988, 3.7 percent in 1987 and 4.4 percent in 1986. It soared 7.6percent in 1985, which had marked the sixth straight year ofincreases.   NATO's European members have responded to the U.S. push for moremilitary money with figures showing their total defense spendingskyrocketed 34 percent, after adjustment for inflation, between 1970and 1987. U.S. spending, in contrast, was up 15 percent over thesame period.   Per capital defense spending, according to these figures, grew 21percent in the European countries over the 1970-86 period, comparedwith a 3 percent decline in the United States. Military manpoweradvanced 5 percent in Europe over 1970-87, compared with a 31percent decline in the United States, according to the Europeanfigures.</TEXT></DOC>
