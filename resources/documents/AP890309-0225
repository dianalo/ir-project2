The latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday bythe Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the TreasuryDepartment bought or sold $4.3 billion for the equivalent amount ofWest German marks or Japanese yen between Nov. 1 and Jan. 31.   Both agencies bought $2.4 billion against those two currencies inNovember and early December and sold $1.88 billion against marks inJanuary as market sentiment turned more bullish.   In the previous three-month period, from August to October, U.S.intervention totaled $2.3 billion, with the government selling $2.14billion for marks and buying $200 billion with yen.   Sam Y. Cross, an executive vice president of the New York Fed,said the latest operations were designed to maintain marketstability and generally were coordinated between the central banksof the ``Group of Seven'' industrial nations. Besides the UnitedStates, the G-7 includes Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italyand Canada.   ``We don't have targets for the dollar,'' Cross explained at anews briefing. ``We just try to bring about greater stability.''   Cross said that some of the government's intervention operationswere done jointly with other central banks, but at other times theUnited States acted alone after notifying its trading partners.   Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities ofcentral banks in the open markets, but the Fed's policy is tocomment only well after the fact. The Fed also does not provide anydata on intervention by foreign central banks.   The dollar-buying operations by the Fed and Treasury in Novemberand early December came as the currency was coming under continuingpressure in worldwide markets, especially against the mark and yen.   The dollar had started to decline in late September and reachedits lows of the November-January period on Nov. 25, when it fell to120.65 yen and 1.7085 marks, or about 11 percent below the highs ofthe year reached in early fall. Lately it has been trading in themarkets at around 1.80 marks and 128 yen.   The dollar's weakness had come as the market began to doubt thatthe large improvement in the U.S. trade deficit experienced duringearly 1988 would continue. Traders also expressed growing impatiencewith the lack of progress in reducing the nation's huge budgetdeficit.   Those concerns came to a head after the Nov. 4 presidentialelection, with currency traders questioning whether the Bushadministration could reduce the twin deficits and keep its promisenot to raise taxes.   Intervention began Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, when the government bought$350 million against the sale of yen, according to the Fed report.The government also entered the market from Nov. 9 to Nov. 16, whenit bought $625 million with yen; and between Nov. 17 and Dec. 2,when it bought $795 million with yen and $630 million against marks,the report said.   By the new year, the currency market had shed its negative viewof the dollar. The turnaround began after Soviet General SecretaryGorbachev proposed Soviet arms cuts in a Dec. 7 speech before theUnited Nations.   The speech ``was temporarily seen as providing scope for theUnited States to reduce its budget deficit through defense spendingcuts,'' the Fed report noted. But even after that, the dollarcontinued to rise as interest rates continued to move higher, itsaid.   The government sold dollars against marks on the 12 days betweenJan. 6 and Jan. 27, the report said.   The dollar reached its highest point of the decade in February1985. It declined slightly until September 1985, when G-7 leadersagreed to lower its value to help narrow the U.S. trade gap andstave off protectionist sentiment in Congress.   The dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 beforerebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
