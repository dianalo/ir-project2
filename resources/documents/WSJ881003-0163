In ruling that Eastern can furlough 4,000 employees, the three-judge panel in Washington, D.C., said that U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker erred in holding that the layoffs violated the Railway Labor Act. Eastern's unions had charged -- and Judge Parker had agreed -- that the layoffs were calculated to hurt unionized Eastern while helping non-union Continental, both units of Texas Air Corp. Since acquiring Eastern in 1986, Texas Air has implicitly threatened to shed Eastern assets if the unions fail to help reduce costs.    &quot;This clears the air and totally vindicates Eastern,&quot; said John Gallagher of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer andamp; Feld, who represents Texas Air.    The decision Friday, which follows an earlier temporary stay of Judge Parker's injunction, comes as a relief to all major airlines, which, in a joint friend-of-the-court brief, had derided the lower-court injunction as an unfair restriction on management's ability to deploy airplanes and employees. &quot;Every railroad and every airline in the country is watching this opinion,&quot; said Clark Onstad, a vice president of Texas Air.    Eastern's unions also called attention to the broad significance of the ruling. &quot;It's going to cause concern for any employees embraced by the Railway Labor Act, because it distorts what was to this point a rather level playing field,&quot; said James H. Linsey of Cohen, Weiss andamp; Simon, a lawyer for the pilots union at Eastern.    Unless the unions succeed in their effort to get a rehearing from the appeals court, Eastern's victory returns the focus of the labor-cost battle to the National Mediation Board, which is supervising contract talks between the company and its machinists union. Under special labor laws applying to airlines, Eastern will be free to impose its own contract on the machinists if the board declares an impasse.    The three-judge panel found that Eastern's furloughs were part of a longstanding pattern of cutbacks undertaken by the financially strapped airline. Thus, the judges said, the layoffs were within the past practice of the airline -- not a violation of the &quot;status quo&quot; provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The act -- dating to a time when commerce froze if railroads were struck -- prevents employers from unilaterally changing working conditions while contract negotiations are under way.    The unions had a string of court victories earlier this year by adroitly using the act, temporarily blocking Eastern from selling its profitable East Coast shuttle service in a transaction that the company ultimately dropped, and barring Eastern from training replacement pilots in advance of a possible pilot strike.    The layoffs arose from Eastern's decision to close its Kansas City, Mo., hub and halt unprofitable flights to 14 mostly Western cities. Eastern never earned a profit during five years of operations in Kansas City, and has lately posted losses there of roughly $1.5 million a week.    In a big setback for the unions, the appeals court also rejected Judge Parker's finding that Texas Air had plundered Eastern of assets to hurt the unions and to benefit non-union Continental. &quot;The evidence in the record . . . does not establish that Eastern implemented a plan to deliberately 'bleed off' Eastern's assets,&quot; the judges wrote.    The unions said they may petition the court for a hearing before all 11 members of the appeals court to review Friday's decision. Failing that, the unions will return to Judge Parker's court for a full trial on a pending lawsuit against the transfer of assets from Eastern to Continental. </TEXT></DOC>
