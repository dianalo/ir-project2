Overall energy use in the state increased 6% spreadover almost all end-use sectors. The increase reflected a colder yearthan 1986 and a large population increase. On the supply side, the mostimpressive change in meeting demand was a substantial (23%) increasein the use of natural gas, particularly for power production and in theindustrial sector. The increase was fostered by drought conditions thatlimited hydropower, by the increased availability of out-of-state supplies,and by changes in regulations governing gas transmissions. The numberof cogenerators and self-generators grew faster than in the nation asa whole. The amount of power sold to the utilities by this group wasdouble the amount sold in 1985, posing problems to utilities and regulatoryagencies alike. Alternate sources of energy continued to grow. The state'swindfarms and geothermal installations are the largest in the world.The state sponsored methanol program moved ahead with the introductionof flexible fueled automobiles into the state's fleet and installationof a large number of service stations selling the fuel. Nonetheless,California's energy picture is dominated by the use of petroleum andnatural gas, the bulk of which are imported. 31 refs., 3 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
