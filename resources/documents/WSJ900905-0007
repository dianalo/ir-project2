Apple and Adobe said yesterday that they had signed aletter of intent to reach a &quot;new and expanded&quot; technologylicensing agreement. Under terms of the accord, Apple andAdobe plan to continue to work together to provide newproducts based on Adobe's PostScript software and printertechnology developed by Apple. PostScript creates images andtype fonts on computer screens and printers, enabling usersto see exactly what will issue from their printers.</LP><TEXT>   Although the two companies declined to provide details,the agreement appears to be a reconciliation of sorts. Lastyear, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., announced that itwould sell its 16.4% equity stake in Adobe, based in MountainView, Calif. It also said it would compete with Adobe bydeveloping a clone of PostScript with Microsoft, the biggestmaker of personal computer software. Apple's action wasviewed as a major blow to Adobe, since Apple was Adobe'slargest shareholder and customer, accounting for 28% ofAdobe's revenue during 1988.   Yesterday's agreement was seen by analysts as a move byApple to stay at least neutral in offering desktop publishingsoftware from both Microsoft and Adobe, letting the marketdecide the winner. In March, International Business MachinesCorp. said it would bundle PostScript with all lines of itscomputers, but would only offer Microsoft's version with itsPC line.   After the announcement, Adobe shares jumped $3.125 toclose at $28.125 in national over-the-counter trading.Adobe's stock is still depressed however, trading far belowits 12-month high of $50.75 a share, reached in May.   &quot;When your largest customer suddenly says that they needyou after they have been saying they didn't need you, that'sa pretty good vote of confidence,&quot; said Steven L. Ossad, ananalyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.   An Apple spokeswoman said the agreement isn't a change inplans. &quot;We always said we would work with multivendors,&quot; shesaid.   Analysts held varying opinions as to just how positive theagreement was for Adobe. Shearson Lehman Brothers analystDavid S. Nelson, for one, called the impending agreement a&quot;monumental&quot; development for Adobe. Mr. Nelson said the pactnot only solidifies Adobe's relationship with its largestclient, but affirms Adobe as the pre-eminent vendor ofcomputer printing software.   Analyst Bruce M. Lupatkin of Hambrecht andamp; Quist in SanFrancisco said the relationship solidifies nothing. Apple, hesaid, is keeping its options open to work with both Adobe andMicrosoft. &quot;My guess is that Apple is hedging its bets,&quot; Mr.Lupatkin said. &quot;Apple is saying it can support Adobe'stechnology, but that it is also supporting Microsoft'stechnology. Ultimately, the best technology will win.&quot;   &quot;With this announcement, the relationship has gottenextremely better,&quot; said John E. Warnock, Adobe chairman andchief executive officer, in a teleconference with reporters.&quot;Apple needs Adobe and Adobe needs Apple.&quot;   Mr. Warnock said that there has been considerablespeculation among investors and in the press that Apple andAdobe were drifting further apart. &quot;I think the real meat ofthis announcement is that we aren't&quot; drifting apart, he said.&quot;This is a public reaffirmation that we plan to continue thatprocess&quot; of cooperation.   &quot;Continuing to work closely with excellent third-partyvendors such as Adobe has many benefits for Macintoshcustomers,&quot; said Randy Battat, vice president of productmarketing for Apple.</TEXT></DOC>
