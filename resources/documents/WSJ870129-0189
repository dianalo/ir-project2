It brought to mind an experience I had recently in London, when I attended a concert of the Royal Philharmonic at the Royal Festival Hall.    The conductor was Russian Yuri Temirkanov, who is a slim, athletic-appearing gentleman with a shock of black hair, and who conducts without a baton. He waves his hands; he moves his body; he tosses his head and hair; he is constantly in motion.    During the intermission I was standing in the lobby viewing a case in which were mounted batons from all the legendary conductors who had led the orchestra over the years. There were fat batons, short batons, long batons, skinny batons, wispy batons, etc.    I remarked, sort of to myself, that &quot;they'll never get a baton from this fellow.&quot; And a gentleman standing next to me remarked, &quot;Well, maybe they could mount a lock of his hair.&quot;    Robert L.
