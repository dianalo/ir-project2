(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Spreadsheets Spotlight New Features and Application InterfacesandM;Spreadsheets have come a long way since VisiCalc became the first personalcomputer software superstar in the early 1980s.andP;  Vendors have since addednumerous features to transform spreadsheets from basic financial tools intoturbo-charged application instruments.andP;  Today sophisticated features such asintegrated graphics, interfaces to relational database management systems andreal-time data links are becoming common adjuncts.andM;In addition, some spreadsheets can represent data in multiple dimensions, andothers allow users to link cells in different worksheets, providing new waysto process and present data.andP;  Windowing interfaces, such as X windows andDECwindows, are just beginning to catch on in the spreadsheet market.andP;  Unixspreadsheets are also appearing in increasing numbers, both from vendors whoare new to the DEC-compatible spreadsheet market and from vendors who alsooffer VAX or PDP-11 spreadsheets.andM;Despite the increasing number of specialized features, the foundation ofevery spreadsheet remains essentially unchanged: It is still atwo-dimensional grid of cells used to perform calculations, analyze data andforecast trends.andP;  In their most basic--and least expensive--form,spreadsheets simply let users enter numbers, formulas and functions, andautomatically recalculate values based on new data.andP;  Most spreadsheets alsolet users create search strings and combine lengthy series of keystrokes tocreate complex and efficient macro commands.andM;Prices for basic VAX spreadsheets haven't changed much in the past few years,nor has there been more than incremental enhancement of the core spreadsheetprices increase, so do the number of features that reach beyond thespreadsheet norm.andP;  These can include capabilities such as worksheetencryption and passwords, integrated graphics, and interfaces to extra-costgraphics packages, relational database management systems and other businessapplications.andM;Because these capabilities can add considerable expense, buyers shouldcarefully examine their needs to determine which features are most important,and therefore which spreadsheets are the most suitable and least costly fortheir particular applications.andM;One of the more significant recent trends in the spreadsheet market is theincreasing appearance of standard and optional interfaces to RDBMSes.andP;  Manyvendors in the spreadsheet market now allow users to access data not only inRMS files, but also in such RDBMSes as Oracle, Ingres, DEC's Rdb and InformixSoftware's Informix-SQL.andM;Such spreadsheets serve essentially as a window into the database.andP;  Thespreadsheet provides an easy, familiar tool for viewing and analyzingdatabase files, whereas the more powerful features some RDBMSes offer, suchas a fourth-generation reporting language, can make the spreadsheet and RDBMSfunction as a sophisticated data processing system.andM;In a relational database, the description of data is called a schema.andO;Columnsz in the spreadsheet point to fields in the RDBMS schema, andspreadsheet rows are instances of each field.andP;  Generally, spreadsheet uershave just read-only access to the database, and other applications orprocesses store data in and update the database.andP;  But there is at least oneexceptiond: Oracle's SQL*Calc lets spreadsheet users update data in theOracle RDBMS.andM;First-time spreadsheet buyers should determine whether the spreadsheetproducts they're considering can link to any relational database productsalready in use on-site.andP;  However, buyers who also need to select an RDBMSproduct should not limit the scope of their database shopping to thosepackages that their favorite spreadsheet can access.andP;  An RDBMS' capabilitiesand importance generally outweigh a spreadsheet's role, so it's wise toselect an appropriate RDBMS first.andM;Another significant trend among VAX and PDP-11 spreadsheets is the advent ofreal-time data gathering capabilities.andP;  Real-time data gathering involveslinking the spreadsheet to an electronic data feed that continuously updatesthe spreadsheet while users monitor the action on a terminal screen.andP;  Thecapability can provide crucial, up-to-the-minute information for users suchas stockbrokers and manufacturing automation managers.andP;  Access Technology andUnipress Software both offer this capability with their spreadsheets.andM;It's also important for VAX and PDP-11 spreadsheet buyers to consider whetherto get one of the increasing number of products that claim to be compatiblewith the 1-2-3 spreadsheet from Lotus Development of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Forspreadsheet users accustomed to running 1-2-3 on personal computers, a1-2-3-compatible VAX spreadsheet can smooth the transition to the newsoftware.andM;The problem, according to Brian Danaher, president of AOK Software Products,is that 1-2-3 compatibility is &quot;a loose expression.&quot;andP;  Some vendors claimtheir products are &quot;Lotus-like&quot; because users press the slash key to summon ahorizontal menu--just like 1-2-3.andP;  But the similarities might end there.andM;Other packages, such as AOK's AOK.abc and Timeline's DigiCalc II, take 1-2-3compatibility further.andP;  They present a menu that is virtually identical inappearance and function to 1-2-3's, and let users import 1-2-3 files and runmacros written in 1-2-3 with little or no alteration.andM;Meanwhile, there's Lotus itself.andP;  In November 1988, the company announcedthat it was developing a VAX version of 1-2-3.andP;  So far, no product hasemerged.andP;  According to Bob Hatcher, Lotus' product line manager for DECproducts, 1-2-3 for VAXes is currently being used at beta test sites and willbe released during the first half of this year.andM;Hatcher said the VAX version of 1-2-3 will make its appearance in threephases.andP;  The first phase will provide the basic VAX version.andP;  The secondphase will be a version of 1-2-3 that can be integrated with DEC's All-in-1environment, and the third phase will include support for DECwindows, DEC'sversion of the X windows protocol.andM;When the spreadsheet finally emerges, DEC will offer 1-2-3 for VAXes througha non-exclusive distribution agreement with Lotus, according to Chris Reed,DEC's marketing manager for business intelligence systems.andP;  Reed said the VAXversion of 1-2-3 will let businesses standardize around a single spreadsheet,whether users employ terminals, personal computers or workstations.andM;Of course, many VAX spreadsheets are available in compatible personalcomputer versions.andP;  With third-party spreadsheets offering varying degrees of1-2-3 compatibility, buyers who need to exchange spreadsheets betweenpersonal computers and VAXes would be wise to shop around.andM;There are additional considerations for buyers who are trying to decidebetween purchasing a VAX spreadsheet and a product for a PC network.andP;  Besidescomparing the functions of the different spreadsheets, buyers should comparethe costs of the packages and the cost per user.andP;  This includes the cost ofmaintenance and, in the case of a PC environment, that of maintainingspreadsheets that are running on individual personal computers.andP;  In addition,look for a vendor with an able support and training program.andP;  When evaluatingspreadsheets, buyers should call the vendor's support hot line and judge theeffectiveness of its response.andM;Many users need the ability to consolidate data from two or morespreadsheets.andP;  For instance, they might want to use information from onespreadsheet in a different context in another, but without having to reenterthe data.andP;  Rekeying data wastes time and disk space, and can introducetypographical errors.andP;  Inaccuracies can also result if users enter new datainto one spreadsheet and forget to update the related version.andM;In general, there are two ways to avoid redundancy when consolidating data.andO;The first, the hierarchical approach, involves electronically linkedspreadsheets.andP;  Data in one cell or a range of cells in a spreadsheet can bedirectly referred to in one or more additional spreadsheets.andP;  when data inthe original worksheet is updated, the new values are reflected in the linkedspreadsheet.andP;  Access Technology's 20/20 and AOK Software's AOK.abc are amongthe spreadsheets that offer this capability.andM;Consolidating data in this fashion provides considerable flexibility.andP;  Thesecond spreadsheet's format can be entirely different from that of the firstspreadsheet.andP;  For example, a linked spreadsheet could summarize detailed datadrawn from a number of lower-level spreadsheets.andM;Hierarchically linked spreadsheets aren't fail-safe, however.andP;  If there aresubstantial changes to the original spreadsheet or spreadsheets, a linkedspreadsheet can essentially lose track of the cells with which it's supposedto be connected.andP;  In addition, spreadsheet recalculations tend to slow downin proportion to the number of spreadsheets that are linked together becausenot one but several worksheets are being accessed and updated.andM;The second approach, the multidimensional spreadsheet, avoids these problems.andO;In additiona to the familiar x and y axes common to all spreadsheets, amultidimensional spreadsheet adds axes at right angles to the other two,giving depth to formerly flat planes.andP;  Each layer in a multidimensionalspreadsheet is called a page.andP;  The simplest multidimensional spreadsheet hasthree dimensions.andM;Employing a multidimensional spreadsheet, a user could create a financialmodel with rows of expense categories, columns of budgeted and actualexpenses, and several pages representing several months' worth of data.andP;  Thedata can usually be viewed across any axis.andP;  The financial users could lookat one month's budgeted and actual expenses for all categories, for example,or the actual expenses of all months for one category.andM;Looking at a spreadsheet becomes difficult as it acquires more dimensions.andO;However, some spreadsheets support n-dimensional layouts, meaning that theycan support virtually limitless numbers of dimensions.andP;  Timeline's DigiCalcII, for example, offers a maximum capacity of 65,535 dimensions.andP;  Suchspreadsheets can prove useful if users need to track data that's categorizedaccording to numerous and diverse criteria.andM;Multidimensional spreadsheets contain all data in one file, which allows forfaster file access.andP;  But they are also more structurally constrained thanhierarchical spreadsheets, because each page of a multidimensionalspreadsheet must have the same structure as every other page.andM;Despite considerable growth during the past year in the number of terminalsand workstations that support X windows, few spreadsheets currently supportthe protocol.andP;  The reason, AOK software's Danaher said, is that mostspreadsheet buyers haven't invested in the more expensive terminals needed torun X windows.andM;Many spreadsheet vendors said they're waiting for more affordable X terminalsto appear before they begin to offer spreadsheets that support the windowingprotocol.andP;  With X terminal prices slowly moving downward, that wait may beover within the next year or two.andP;  (See &quot;High-Resolution Graphics TerminalsPick Up New Capabilities and Appeal,&quot; DR, Jan. 15, page 33; and &quot;Xtravaganza&quot;on page 29 of this issue for a look at six of the leading DEC-compatible Xterminals.)andM;Some spreadsheet vendors are working toward X support now.andP;  For example, KenKunstmann, president of Saturn Systems, said the Saturn-Calc spreadsheet willsupport X windows by the middle of the year.andP;  He said Saturn hopes X windowssupport will help to court buyers seeking spreadsheet packages forworkstation users.andP;  In addition, Access Technology intends to release aDECwindows version of 20/20 by the end of this month.andP;  DEC now bundlesDECwindows, its own implementatio of X windows, with VMS version 5.0 andabove.andM;On the Unix front, there are only a small number of office automationapplications currently available for Unix environments.andP;  But that situationwill begin to change this year, according to CArl Nelson, president of AccessTechnology.andP;  Nelson predicted that growing Unix standardization will lead togreater acceptance of Unix as a business operating system.andM;Spreadsheet vendors, attracted by the growth of Unix workstations in the VAXmarket, have been among the first software makers to jump into the Unixbusiness application market.andP;  Many VAX spreadsheets, including 20/20,Interactive Systems' Mentor and Oracle's SQL*Calc, are now available in bothVMS and Unix versions, and more spreadsheet vendors will no doubt join theUnix ranks.andM;As these various developments indicate, DEC-compatible spreadsheets arecontinuing to grow in scope and power.andP;  The spreadsheet market has matured tothe point where buyers have a wide range of packages and optional featuresfrom which to choose.andP;  There are packages for expert and inexperiencedspreadsheet users alike, and some of the spreadsheets are designed toaccommodate both types of users readily and efficiently.andM;Of course, as with any software, spreadsheet buyers should consider theirspecific needs carefully before making a purchase decision.andP;  It isn'tdifficult to end up with a spreadsheet loaded with expensive features thatusers might never employ.andP;  Spreadsheet buyers truly get what they pay for; ifthey need less, they can spend less.andP;  On the other hand, if they want more,and their budgets allow the additional expenditure, there are some mightypowerful spreadsheet packages out there.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
