Mr. Clegg, 33 years old,resigned after rumors linked him and the firm to an IrishRepublican Army money-laundering scheme.   Mr. Clegg couldn't be reached for comment, but a Wacespokesman said he was unaware of &quot;any links&quot; of either thecompany or Mr. Clegg to the IRA, adding that the executivehad resigned believing the rumors might continue to harm theBristol, England, company.</LP><TEXT>   On Friday, before the announcement, Wace stock dropped 64pence a share to 104 pence in trading on the London StockExchange. It rose yesterday to 125 pence.   The resignation came a week after a report in London'sSunday Telegraph that claimed the IRA had been using a Londonfirm to launder millions of dollars through London's stockexchange. The paper didn't identify Wace, but the name latercame up in stock exchange rumors.   British and Irish authorities declined to comment onwhether there is an ongoing investigation. The Telegraphreport was contradicted by a subsequent report by London'sFinancial Times. The newspaper said that while NorthernIreland's Royal Ulster Constabulary had investigated linksbetween Mr. Clegg and the IRA, it had found no evidence andhad dropped the inquiry and that Britain's Serious FraudOffice also declined to pursue the matter.</TEXT></DOC>
