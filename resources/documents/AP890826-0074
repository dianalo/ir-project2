(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An insurance salesman whose phonenumber was mistakenly listed in a pizza ad says even though he makesa pretty good home-cooked pizza, he isn't ready to deliver.   Hank Foiles says his telephone has been going non-stop sincePizza Hut mailed out an ad last week to thousands of homes.   Calls from hungry customers began Thursday night, but they didn'thit a peak until Friday afternoon.   ``Since 4:30, there's been a call about every two minutes,''Foiles said Friday. Not one was a personal call.   He said Pizza Hut had assured him the problem would be corrected,but company officials declined to comment.   Pizza Hut offered to put an answering machine on Foiles' line torefer callers to the correct number, he said. In the meantime,friends trying to reach Foiles will have to rely on his businesstelephone line.   ``The manager told me, `If you want to leave for the weekend andgo somewhere else and check in, we'll take care of it for you,'''Foiles said. ``They offered to keep me and my friends in pizza for ayear, or me for life.''   But Foiles said he likes his own home-cooked pizza just fine.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A vintage steam locomotive, whose last run 36years ago almost led to the scrapyard, will return to the rails nextmonth.   Engine No. 290 is ready for a new assignment, hauling touristsand railroad buffs on trips around the city and beyond.   The inaugural run between Atlanta and Macon is set for Sept. 10.   The thunder of the engine's 6-foot driving wheels hasn't beenheard in decades, since No. 290 pulled the crack Crescent Limitedpassenger train between Atlanta and Montgomery. So steam buffs arehailing the restored engine's pending debut as a chapter in a battleagainst indifference, rust and neglect.   ``I grew up in the steam era, and to see her back under steam isgoing to be an accomplishment,'' said Charlie Strike, president ofthe Atlanta chapter of the National Railway Historical Society _ nowthe engine's owner.   ``I don't know any kid, young or old, that doesn't get a rise outof seeing a steam engine thundering by,'' he said.   Restoration of No. 290 has been a joint effort of the society andthe Georgia Building Authority, which mostly manages state officebuildings but also runs the ``New Georgia Railroad,'' offeringregularly scheduled trips around the city and to state-owned StoneMountain over existing, commercial tracks.   Once No. 290 is under steam, the engine will alternate with NewGeorgia's other steam engine _ the smaller and older No. 750 _ andits stable of four diesels in providing front-end power for trips.   Built in 1926, No. 290 was slated for the scrap heap when thediesel age dawned in earnest following World War II. The engine'slast run was in 1953.</TEXT></DOC>
