<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0139 </DOCNO><TEXT>During this report period, all experiments were conducted with tuff fromthe proposed high-level nuclear waste site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.Batch sorption ratio determinations were conducted for strontium, cesium,uranium, and technetium onto samples of tuff using real and syntheticgroundwater J-13. There were no significant differences in sorption ratiosin experiments with real and synthetic groundwater. Columns were testedby determination of elution curves in J-13 containing tritium and technetiumas the TcO{sub 4}{sup {minus}} ion. For strontium and cesium, fairlygood correlation between values of the sorption ratio obtained by thetwo methods was observed. Little technetium sorption was observed witheither method. The elution peaks obtained with neptunium and uraniumwere asymmetrical and the shapes were often complex, observations whichsuggest irreversibilities in the sorption reaction. Synthetic groundwaterJ-13 was slowly dripped onto a slab of tuff maintained at 95--100{degree}C,and the result was a thin encrustation of solids on the slab as the waterevaporated. Fresh J-13 groundwater was then allowed to contact the encrustationin a vessel maintained at 90{degree}C. The principal result of the experimentwas a significant loss of calcium and magnesium from the fresh J-13 groundwater.13 refs. 25 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
