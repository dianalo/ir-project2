A measure to require minimum health coverage for all workers, offered by Sen. Kennedy, would send companies' health-care costs &quot;out of the ballpark,&quot; says a United Medical Corp. official. Federated Department Stores Inc. and Marriott Corp. warn that a provision covering part-time help would deter hiring. None of 70 companies surveyed by New York consultant TPFandamp;C meet all the bill's aims, like well-baby coverage.    Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, benefits consultant, says 80% of 854 employer responses tallied so far in a survey oppose the bill; most small companies can't afford its price tag, an official says. Companies, including Giant Food Inc. and Priam Corp., a San Jose, Calif., computer disk-drive maker, balk at any such federal mandate.    Kennedy's Labor Committee may bend some provisions, such as part-time worker coverage, and simply require compliance with overall benefit sums.    WHEN CAN YOU RETIRE? Most workers don't seem to know.    A study by the General Accounting Office shows that up to 82% of workers in a pension study were wrong about when they qualify for retirement benefits. Half of required plan summaries for employees are faulty, a Labor Department review finds. The agency still hasn't issued rules for employers to tell workers of their benefits status, as ordered by the 1974 Erisa law.    Without better knowledge, workers can't make &quot;informed career decisions&quot; or plan &quot;for their financial security,&quot; a Labor Department advisory group warns. But the department says most employer summaries are &quot;understandable,&quot; and existing benefit record-keeping regulations probably limit the &quot;knowledge gap.&quot;    TEAMSTERS GEAR UP to fight a federal takeover move.    The big union faces Justice Department court action -- now delayed for at least several months -- to oust its leadership. So the union has begun a special membership voter registration drive and urges members to lobby Congress to denounce the takeover try. They'll be helped by Drive, a fast-growing Teamsters political action committee, which expects to raise $4 million this year, up from $2.7 million in 1986.    Full-page Teamsters newspaper ads liken the union to Poland's Solidarity as the union seeks -- and gains -- wide support. Presidential candidates Jackson, Kemp, Haig and Simon lend support at a Cincinnati Teamsters rally. So do other unions. Even such foes as the AFL-CIO and a dissident Teamsters group oppose a takeover.    Americans Against Government Control of Unions, a new union group, plans a related $1 million lobbying effort.    THE WHITE HOUSE moves toward deciding on a possible bailout for shaky steel-industry pension plans. The issues: whether Congress will force the subsidy by moving to act first; how much should be paid, and what pension reform can be won in return. The Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank, urges the aid.    STAY-AT-HOMES: The percentage of rehired fired executives changing states for new jobs fell to 32% in the second quarter, the lowest since 1981, says James Challenger, a Chicago placement man. The high was 45% in the 1986 first quarter. Mr. Challenger cites strong local job markets and working spouses who won't move, among other reasons.    DANGEROUS DRIVING: Big-rig truck drivers who stay behind the wheel more than eight hours straight have a 50% greater chance of being in a crash than those who drive two to eight hours at a stretch, an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study shows. Federal rules allow 10-hour driving stints.    TEACHER STRIKES rose to 87 in the 1986-1987 school year from 71 the year before; the number of teachers involved -- 49,536 -- was almost unchanged, says Government Union Critique, a public-union newsletter. But students whose classes were disrupted fell 59% to 326,431, as more school districts keep teaching during strikes.    &quot;TIN PARACHUTES&quot; are packed by more firms, to unfurl in a takeover.    Hewitt Associates, a Chicago consultant, says 8% of 170 concerns polled offer employees lump sums similar to the now-common &quot;golden parachutes&quot; for top executives who lose their jobs in a merger. Most of these &quot;tin-parachute&quot; plans are less than a year old. Diamond Shamrock Corp.'s two successor companies will give workers up to two years' pay for job loss in a merger under a plan set up after an abortive 1985 takeover try by Occidental Petroleum Corp.    Tin chutes can be a &quot;poison pill&quot; to help block takeovers, or they can cushion employees against job loss or pay cuts. Office-furniture maker Herman Miller Inc., an East Coast drug company and Mobil Corp. now have such plans. Texaco Inc. asks the bankruptcy court to approve tin chutes for U.S. workers.    More companies mull the idea, often because of worker protests over golden chutes for management &quot;fat cats,&quot; says Hewitt partner Webb Bassick.    THE CHECKOFF: Unions back the National Football League players' strike, seeing &quot;scab football teams as a highly visible display of strike-breaking,&quot; an AFL-CIO man says. . . . Jesse Jackson seeks to mediate a dispute between Hyatt Hotels Corp. and a cashier fired for her cornrow hairdo. </TEXT></DOC>
