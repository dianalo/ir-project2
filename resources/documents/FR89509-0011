General License GIFT authorizes exportof parcels from U.S. individuals to individuals or charitable organizationsoverseas.General License GIFT is modified to allow no more than one gift parcelfrom the same donor to the same donee in any one month. Currently, oneparcel may be shipped each week. This change is intended to assure thatthe license is utilized in conformity with its intended purpose, namelythe donative provision of gifts between individuals. Specific authorizationto exceed this limit may be granted on a case-by-case basis to meet compellinghumanitarian concerns (e.g., gifts of medicine to relatives). The Bureauof Export Administration will grant case-by-case exemptions through issuanceof a validated license. For clarity, new text is added on appropriatenessof items as gifts.In accordance with andSection; 786.8 of the EAR, officials of the Officeof Export Enforcement or the U.S. Customs Service may inspect individualor multiple gift parcels. Exporters should also be aware that when parcelsviolate the terms of this general license, they may also violate regulationsissued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury,under the Trading with the Enemy Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This rule is effective May 9, 1989.

This rule is consistent with Executive Order 12291 and 12661.2. This rule does not involve a collection of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Publishing this rule in proposedform would impair the Bureau of Export Administration's ability to imposeeffective and timely controls. This rule is being published in interimform pursuant to section 13(b) of the EAA, and an opportunity for publiccomment is provided. No other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemakingand an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.Because this rule is being issued in interim form, comments will be consideredin the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The period for submission of comments will close June 8, 1989. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompaniedby a request that part or all of the material be treated confidentiallybecause of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. TheDepartment will return such comments and will not consider them in thedevelopment of final regulations. All public comments on these regulationswill be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspectionand copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Departmentrequires comments in written form.
