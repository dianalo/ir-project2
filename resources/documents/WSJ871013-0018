MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MRNCONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><TEXT>   Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it is taking charges totaling about $76 million, after taxes, against third-quarter earnings, to position it for growth in its core businesses.    The Boise, Idaho-based company said it intends to emphasize the core operations of construction and engineering and shipbuilding and discontinue real estate development activities, setting up a pretax charge of about $70 million for losses associated with liquidating those assets over the next several years.    The real estate unit, Emkay Development Co., had 1986 revenue of $39.5 million, 1.9% of the parent company's $2.11 billion in revenue for the year.    The company's financial-report plans weren't disclosed until just before the market closed yesterday. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading its shares closed at $51.75, off 75 cents.    Although Morrison Knudsen won't disclose third-quarter results for another week, the huge charge almost ensures that it will post losses for both the third quarter and the year.    For the 1986 third quarter, Morrison Knudsen posted profit of $10.2 million, or 93 cents a share, on revenue of $513.9 million. For the first six months of 1987, profit fell 34% to $12 million, or $1.09 a share, as revenue declined 9.2% to $963.7 million. The company has blamed the drop in profit on lower-than-expected construction bookings late last year and on a continued earnings decline in its shipbuilding unit.    Morrison Knudsen said it also is taking a $47 million pretax charge for the third quarter to establish reserves covering fixed-price construction, mining and shipbuilding projects. The company cited &quot;industry conditions&quot; for the move and said it may be able to recover some of the reserves through litigation or settlement with customers who changed their orders or otherwise impeded project completion.    The company also said it is taking a $10 million after-tax provision against earnings reflecting its decision to repatriate assets of its Bermuda-based Broadway Insurance Co. captive insurance unit. Morrison Knudsen said the move will improve &quot;operating flexibility and access to about $10 million in cash.&quot;    Third-quarter results also will include a $16 million after-tax write-down of its Brazilian unit, which it plans to repatriate. A spokesman declined to say why the company intends to withdraw from Brazil.    In addition, Morrison Knudsen said it expects to take an about $38 million third-quarter gain from terminating and replacing its overfunded employee pension plan. By buying annuities to cover pension obligations, it said, it can free about $45 million in cash in the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
