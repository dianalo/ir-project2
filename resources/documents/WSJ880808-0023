Stertz </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C </CO><IN> STK HRD AUT </IN><TEXT>   By all rights, Chrysler stock should be hitting the skids. Two weeks ago, the No. 3 auto maker reported earnings fell sharply for the second consecutive quarter. It acknowledged it could no longer afford its gambit of sacrificing profit for market-share gains; inflation sharply increased its costs, and analysts cut earnings estimates left and right.    But the stock improved slightly after the earnings report and has since remained steady. That's because Chrysler is increasingly viewed on Wall Street as a value play -- something that rarely happens to the giants of the auto industry.    Traditionally, Big Three stocks are priced close to earnings or the economy's outlook because of the car industry's cyclical nature. Speculators also avoid the auto stocks because the sheer size of the companies means takeover possibilities are slim. As a result, Chrysler stock has fetched prices only about five times earnings over the past year.    But some analysts and money managers now are calling Chrysler a good long-term play at its current price of 23 3/8, if investors are willing to abandon traditional expectations and tolerate earnings that are likely to appear weak over the next 18 months.    The main reason is Chrysler's 24% stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. That investment will most likely skyrocket in value when Japan's third-largest auto maker lists its stock on Japanese exchanges for the first time later this year.    The Mitsubishi holding was valued at $242 million on Chrysler's books at year-end 1987. But analysts now say Mitusbishi as a whole will be valued as high as $7.3 billion by the end of 1988, raising the worth of Chrysler's stake to as much as $1.7 billion, or about one-quarter of Chrysler's total market capitalization on the New York Stock Exchange.    Thus, the Mitsubishi holding could have a market value of $5.95 a share, estimates Charles Brady, auto analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. He further estimates the minimum combined market value of Chrysler's finance unit, its Acustar Inc. parts unit and its technolgy and aerospace subsidiaries at $18.05 a share.    Using Mr. Brady's calculations, Chrysler, even without its core vehicle business, would have a value of $24 a share. So far this year, Chrysler's highest market price has been 27 3/8, reached in February.    &quot;What you're getting practically for free is Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler, part of Maserati, all of Lamborghini, the whole distribution and sales network and all of the {assembly} plants,&quot; says Mr. Brady. &quot;The strong nonautomotive parts of Chrysler are easily worth the price of the whole right now.&quot;    Some analysts even suggest the company is a remote candidate for a buy-out because it is so undervalued and its holdings would bring a good return if split off. Such thinking usually indicates uncertainty about current management. Specifically, investors wonder how much longer Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, credited with guiding the company through its recovery from near-bankruptcy in the early 1980s, will remain with Chrysler.    Mr. Iacocca, 63 years old, has repeatedly insisted he isn't leaving and, in fact, signed an employment contract that runs through 1990 with an option in 1991. He also has recently re-emerged as an active participant in the company's day-to-day activities.    Even if his status with the company should change, a factor still mitigating against a buy-out is the difficulty of actually splitting off some operations. The troubles Chrysler encountered last March when union protests blocked a proposed sale of the Acustar unit demonstrate how difficult it would be for the auto maker or anyone else to shed Chrysler's valuable assets quickly.    Those analysts and investors who aren't ready to accept Chrysler as a long-term bet see a variety of automotive weaknesses ahead for the company. Even optimists have lowered their 1988 earnings estimates to an average of about $4.50 a share from an average of about $5 a share. They expect next year to come out even lower because of weaker U.S. sales and Chrysler's lack of overseas operations to cushion rising costs in the U.S.    But as Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. analyst Joseph G. Paul argues, investors now are getting at least $40 a share worth of goods for less than $25 a share, no matter what the auto side of the company does. In fact, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s David Healy suspects that Japanese investors, who are noted for their long-range approach to the market, are already buying Chrysler stock to take advantage of the Mitsubishi stake.    &quot;There may be a lot of value with Chrysler's Mitsubishi holdings and its subsidiaries,&quot; Mr. Healy says. &quot;But it's not the kind of value that will be easy to realize immediately.&quot;    ---   Chrysler   (NYSE; Symbol: C)   Business: Auto maker   Year ended Dec. 31, 1987:   Sales: $26.28 billion   Net income: $1.29 billion; or $5.90 a share   Second Quarter, June 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings: $1.45 vs $1.98   Average daily trading volume:   756,083 shares   Common shares outstanding:   220.9 million</TEXT></DOC>
