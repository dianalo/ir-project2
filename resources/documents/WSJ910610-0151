According to individuals with knowledge of thenegotiations, RJR approached its banks in recent weeks to tryto renegotiate at least a portion of its debt.</LP><TEXT>   An RJR spokesman said the company regularly talks to itsbanks and is always looking for ways to reduce the amount andaverage cost of its debt. A report about the latestnegotiations first appeared in Friday's American Banker.   Recently, RJR reduced its debt outstanding by more than $7billion, partly by selling more than $2.3 billion of stockand lower-yielding debt to investors.   RJR's banking group is led by units of Citicorp,Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical Bank and Bankers TrustNew York Corp. Spokesmen for each of the banks declined tocomment on the talks.   RJR is said by people familiar with the talks to beespecially interested in cutting the interest rate it pays ona $2.25 billion term loan made last year. The company ispaying 3.5 points above the London interbank offered rate onthat loan. A one percentage point cut would cut annualinterest payments about $20 million.   Since it was purchased in a $25 billion buy-out two yearsago, RJR has steadily improved its balance sheet. Ratingsagencies boosted RJR subordinated debt and preferred stockratings in the past two months and the stock market reactedfavorably to the sale of RJR securities.   When RJR was first taken private in the leveraged buy-out,the company had $23 of debt for each $1 of equity; itsdebtequity ratio is now less than 3 to 1.   RJR's banks have classified its loans as &quot;highly leveragedtransactions,&quot; making them subject to increased scrutiny byregulators. RJR is said to be seeking to have its loansreclassified because of its significant debt-reductionmeasures.</TEXT></DOC>
