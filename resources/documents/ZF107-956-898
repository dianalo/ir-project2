(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jane MorrisseyandM;The threat of computer viruses may prove to be the network security bane ofthe 1980s, but the proliferation of vaccines will shift users' focus to moreharmful computer crimes over the next decade, according to a leading industryexpert.andM;A handful of more serious dangers threaten to surpass the &quot;overblown&quot; virusscare, said Donn Parker, information security specialist at SRIInternational, a computer-security research and consulting firm in MenloPark, Calif.andM;Parker, speaking at the recent InfoSec '89 network-security conference inPalm Springs, Calif., said a number of fads in crime, or &quot;crime-oids,&quot; as hecalls them, will lead the wave of computer crime in the 1990s.andM;Over the coming years, Parker said, users should expect the following:andM;-- Microcomputer theft will escalate as more criminals realize that theinformation within the computer is even more valuable than the hardware.andM;-- Fraud involving electronic data interchange will continue until systemparameters are altered to catch criminals off-guard.andP;  For example, criminalsoften transfer sums of $9,999, thereby avoiding automatic background checksby financial institutions on transactions of more than $10,000.andP;  Currently,such a parameter can lie unchanged for long periods of time.andM;-- Until network management becomes more sophisticated, many networks willnot be monitored for &quot;phantom nodes&quot; that illegally tap into and stripinformation from the network.andM;-- Another new and more ominous threat is already being reported: voice-mailterrorism -- tapping into personal phone messages or even bringing down avoice-mail system.andM;It is virtually impossible to gauge the aggregate losses from these securitybreaches, Parker contends.andP;  Many cases are not reported to the authorities,and even when they are, it is difficult to quantify in dollars the cost oflost productivity, he said.andP;  &quot;There is less business crime because of the useof computers, but at the same time the losses per case are going updramatically,&quot; said Parker, who also founded the International InformationIntegrity Institute.andM;While the potential gains of computer crime are great, security schemes suchas user authentication are also becoming more prevalent and will prevent someof those crimes, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
