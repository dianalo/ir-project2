In interviews with a cross section of those gathered here for the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association, bankers noted that only a few banks, including Marine Midland Bank, and no other major bank Friday copied Chemical's increase. They interpreted this as a sign that banks generally are waiting for further upward pressure on rates before boosting them.    Banks often raise their rates to borrowers on Fridays because it tends to draw less publicity and puts the higher rate into effect over a weekend.    John F. McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York, said, &quot;We don't intend to raise our rates unless we're forced to.&quot;    Referring to last Friday's record plunge in the stock market, he added, &quot;When you're in the middle of a maelstrom, raising rates is not the thing to do. We don't think the Federal Reserve Board is sending a signal that it wants rates up. And Treasury Secretary James Baker is saying the same thing.&quot;    Thomas J. Stanton Jr., chairman of First Jersey National Corp., Jersey City, N.J., added, &quot;I hope that other banks don't follow Chemical. Having the prime raised twice in the same week is no good. I think as a policy matter, it's not the message that we want to send to the American public. People tend to look on bankers as money grubbing as it is. There are times when you just have to suck in your gut. This is one of them.&quot;    The prime rate isn't as indicative of borrowing costs as it once was. Nevertheless, it remains largely symbolic of where general rates on business and consumer loans are headed. Large corporations have access to cheaper funds through the commercial paper market and often pay less than prime on their banks. Even smaller businesses with prime-based loans often have the option of switching from prime to another rate, such as the London Interbank Borrowing Rate, or Libor. Consumer loans are often pegged to banks' cost of funds or the federal funds rate.    Nevertheless, other bankers see more widespread increases in the prime ahead. Though his bank hasn't matched Chemical's increase, Anthony P. Terracciano, president and chief operating officer of Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp., said, &quot;I think everybody will follow Chemical. But there's no need to rush.&quot;    Robert H. Dugger, chief economist for the bankers association, said recent increases in the rates that banks charge each other are forcing banks to charge borrowers more to maintain their spreads. The federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other on reserves loaned overnight, averaged 7.75% late last week, up from 7.59% earlier in the week and 7.43% the previous week.    But others, such as Mr. McGillicuddy, said that they are hesitant to boost their rates unless the Federal Reserve Board raises the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks and savings and loans. The Fed last week quashed speculation about an increase in the discount rate when it injected funds into the banking system.    Mr. Dugger said the nation's continuing trade deficit is feeding a pessimism about future economic conditions and the rate of inflation. Mr. Terracciano said, &quot;Debtor countries tend to have weak currencies,&quot; which forces interest rates upward.    But Mr. McGillicuddy cautioned that too much is being made of the trade deficit. &quot;A few years ago, everyone was focused on (money supply figures such as) M-1 as a proxy for interest rates,&quot; he said. &quot;Today M-1 doesn't count for a thing.&quot;    Bankers will be watching to see if the stock market continues its free fall today as another factor to weigh in any increase in the prime rate. George Clancy, senior lending officer for Signet Banking Corp., Richmond, Va., said &quot;We're not a leader when it comes time to increasing the prime rate. I think we're all going to be watching what the market does Monday. There certainly seems to be some upward pressure on rates, but I hope it is gradual.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
