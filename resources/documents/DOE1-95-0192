<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0192 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the conversion of oxygen-containing compounds on high-silicon zeolites(HSZ), a large amount of water (up to 56 wt.%) is formed, which resultsin significant changes in the catalytic properties of the HSZ at hightemperatures. The effect of coke formation and water on conversion ofmethanol on HSZ was investigated in this study. The studies were conductedon HSZ with a silicate modulus of 50. Conversion of methanol was studiedin a flow-type installation at atmospheric pressure, 663{sup 0}K, andwith a volume flow rate of 0.8-0.9 h{sup -1}. The acid properties ofthe HSZ were studied with adsorption of ammonia by the thermal desorptionmethod.</TEXT></DOC>
