And fund groups say the pace ofsales remained brisk during November.   The last time bond fund inflows got this large was March1987, when bond funds pulled in $9.9 billion just ahead ofthe April 1987 bond-market crash. So far this year, bondfunds have attracted $56.7 billion more than they havesurrendered to departing shareholders, putting bond funds ontrack for their best annual sales since 1986.</LP><TEXT>   During November, bond funds continued to pick up moneyfrom investors dissatisfied with lowly yields on money-marketfunds and certificates of deposit. But in addition, bondfunds also picked up some money that was earmarked for stockfunds. That money got diverted to bond funds instead,following the 120.31-point drop in the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage that occurred Nov. 15.   &quot;Bond funds were the beneficiaries of money coming fromboth the stock funds and the money funds,&quot; says MichaelHines, a marketing vice president with Fidelity Investments,the giant Boston fund group. &quot;You had some money coming outof the equity market, where there was some profit taking. Inaddition, more conservative investors have been moving frommoney funds to bond funds.&quot;   October's $9.6 billion inflow into bond funds was wellahead of September's level, when bond funds attracted $7.9billion. (These figures include bond fund sales lessredemptions, plus the net result of switches between bondfunds and other funds in the same fund group. Reinvesteddividends are excluded.)   &quot;What's driving this is the lack of alternatives,&quot; saysBruce Speca, a senior vice president with TNE Fund Group, aunit of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. &quot;Now we'reseeing the reluctant money coming in, which would rather bein CDs and money funds but just can't accept the yields thatthey're getting.&quot; Money market funds are yielding less than5%, while many bond funds offer yields of 7% and above.   Despite tumbling stock prices, investors are continuing toput money into stock mutual funds. But November's stock fundinflows probably won't match those of October, when stockfunds pulled in $4.8 billion from investors, the highestamount this year.   Broker-sold fund groups such as Franklin Resources,Oppenheimer Management Corp., PaineWebber Group, ShearsonLehman Brothers and TNE Fund Group report little or noreaction to the stock market's recent drop.   &quot;The November 15th market decline had no negative effect,&quot;says William Shiebler, a senior managing director withPutnam, a unit of Marsh andamp; McLennan. &quot;On the Monday after{Friday's market plunge}, we had a strong day. The individualinvestor took that as an opportunity to buy.&quot;   It was a different story at no-load fund groups DreyfusCorp., Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price Associates andScudder, Stevens andamp; Clark, which sell their mutual fundsdirectly to the public. These fund groups report a slowdownin stock fund inflows since Nov. 15. And some companies evensuffered net cash outflows. No-load fund investors, whotypically make their investment decisions without consultinga broker or financial planner, are often quicker to react tomarket events.   But among the major no-load fund groups, there was onenotable exception, Vanguard Group of Valley Forge, Pa. &quot;Itwas relatively quiet until the midmonth clearance sale,&quot; saysBrian Mattes, a Vanguard vice president. But in the weekfollowing the Nov. 15 market drop, money flooded intoVanguard's stock funds. &quot;Our single best day was Monday the18th, when 20% of the month's inflow occurred,&quot; says Mr.Mattes. &quot;They bought on the bad news.&quot;   According to a survey conducted for Fidelity by theUniversity of Michigan Survey Research Center, stock fundinflows are likely to level off in the months ahead. Thesurvey found that 39% of mutual fund owners plan to add totheir stock fund holdings in the next three months, unchangedfrom October's level. (These figures reflect those planningto buy stock funds minus those planning to sell.)   Throughout 1991, stock mutual fund managers have beencutting back on the amount of money they keep sitting inmoney market instruments. In August, cash holdings as apercentage of stock fund assets reached a seven-year low of8%.   But more recently, stock fund managers have been buildingup their cash again, so that they finished October with 8.7%of their assets in cash -- just in time for the mid-Novembermarket tumble. A. Michael Lipper, president of LipperAnalytical Services, believes, &quot;some of that money was putback into the market&quot; following the Nov. 15 correction.</TEXT></DOC>
