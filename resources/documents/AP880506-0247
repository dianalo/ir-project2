Michael Dukakis pursues success with a fiercedetermination. George Bush is an ``ideal No. 2.''   Gail Sheehy provides these character assessments of thepresidential candidates in her new book, ``Character: America'sSearch for Leadership.''   The book, which will be published this week, updates a series ofprofiles Sheehy did for Vanity Fair magazine during the past twoyears and adds a new study _ President Reagan.   ``Character is more than just a factor in our evaluation of howwe are going to vote,'' Sheehy writes in her book. ``It affects usall as an essential ingredient in how we work, play and deal withother people.''   The author, asked during the 1984 campaign to write a story on``What made Gary Hart tick?,'' said she found ``a virginterritory'' of reporting on a candidate's character.   ``I went and looked at them as human beings,'' Sheehy said in atelephone interview last week. ``Why wait for the biography whenthey're out of favor, out of office, out of life. These are earlybiographies.''   At the time, Sheehy said there was ``a lot of snickering aboutthis sort of soft-headed approach.''   ``It's wasn't hard horserace stuff, tipsters. I'm not sayingit's more important, but additional,'' she said.   However, some critics say the style of reporting ispsychoanalyzing by a journalist and that Sheehy is neither trainednor qualified to do it. She believes she answers her critics in thebook.   ``I don't pretend to be a psychoanalyst, nor do I work likeone,'' she wrote. ``I base my character analyses on evidence _evidence I go out and dig up.''   In discussing whether she answers the critics, Sheehy noted thatshe doesn't use any psychiatric terms in discussing the candidates.   ``I use the words of journalists and biographers, those beinginsights,'' she said. ``Insights are part of political journalismand literary journalism. It hasn't often been done with majornational political figures except in biographies.''   Her purpose, she says, is to ``mentally go beyond the facade''created by the campaign image-makers and the media.   Here is a summary of Sheehy's profiles of the three remainingpresidential candidates and Reagan.</TEXT><HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD><TEXT>      ``Bush has, in fact, the perfect resume for someone seekingappointive office. He has always been an ideal No. 2: He does whathe is trained to do, never challenges, never initiates ...,''Sheehy wrote. ``If he reaches the White House in 1989, it will notbe through the process of political combat and conquest, but bypolite succession to the throne.''   She suggested that Bush rarely gets fired up about ideas and hasspent a lifetime avoiding confrontation, despite his televisedrun-in with CBS anchorman Dan Rather over the vice president's rolein the Iran-Contra affair.   Bush's baseball hero was not Babe Ruth, but the Yankees' quietIron Horse, Lou Gehrig, Sheehy notes.   In the portrait, Bush describes flying torpedo bombers over thePacific during World War II, including the morning of Sept. 2, 1944when his plane was hit. Bush bailed out and survived in a tiny raftuntil rescued by a U.S. submarine.   The vice president has difficulty discussing the death of hisyoung daughter Robin, who succumbed to leukemia. According to hiswife, Barbara, Bush maintained a bedside vigil at the New Yorkhospital where his daughter underwent chemotheraphy, returning toTexas every few days to manage a new oil business in Midland.   But Sheehy writes, ``Bush apparently can't synthesize theepisodes of highest drama in his life and assign them meaning. Ifhe had been able to see his war experiences as a test of strength,they might have allowed him to perceive himself as strong andmanly. If he had been able to find a deeper spiritual orphilosophical message in his daughter's death, he might be able tofeel good about the courage his wife says he showed.''</TEXT><HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>      ``Stubbornness. This above all, registers as the most consistentmark of Michael Dukakis' character. Monos mou _ by myself _ if nothis first words, he admits, were certainly the watchword of thesecond son born to Panos and Euterpe Dukakis. Was he alwaysstubborn? I asked his mother. `Always. Michael never gave up.'''   Dukakis describes programming himself to grow three inches everyyear until he was 5-foot-11, but he stopped at 5-foot-8.Nevertheless, in junior high school, when the gym teacher said,``All the tall kids line up over here for basketball,'' Dukakisjoined the tall kids.   Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants who dreamed of beinggovernor even in high school, succeeded through much of his life _upper-middle-class, Swarthmore, Harvard Law School, and finallygovernor of Massachusetts. But in 1978, he suffered his firstfailure, losing his re-election bid. At the age of 44, Dukakis wasforced to rethink his mistakes and his career.   ``I blew it,'' he would say, ``too management-oriented andpolitically naive?''   Sheehy writes, ``Dukakis accepted blame for failure just as hehad pursued success _ monos mou, by himself.''   In January, Dukakis told Sheehy, ``I want to be president, butnot so badly; I mean, it's an incredible experience, for all of us.And I'm running to win. But if it isn't there, I'm still going tobe a happy guy.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
