The FHWA, withthis rulemaking, is establishing standards which include commercial driverlicensing and testing procedures to be used by the States; knowledge, skills,and abilities which drivers of different types of CMVs must possess; andthe information to be contained on the commercial driver's license (CDL)issued by the States. The standards also require that CMV drivers takeand pass the appropriate knowledge and skills tests by April 1, 1992, inorder to be qualified and licensed to operate a CMV. These actions arebeing taken to improve the safe operation of CMVs, and to help reduce truckand bus accidents and injuries by effecting minimum Federal standards forthe qualification of CMV operators, as called for in the Act. In addition, the FHWA published a request for comments on several petitionsfor waivers from various requirements of the Act for certain groups ofdrivers on April 14, 1988 (53 FR 12504; FHWA Docket No. MC-88-8). Thesegroups included farmers, firefighters, transit workers, active duty militarypersonnel, certain railroad employees and employees of public utilities.Specifically, the FHWA requested public comment on whether, if granted,the waivers would serve the public interest or diminish public safety asrequired by the waiver provisions included in the Act. The comment periodclosed on May 14, 1988, and the FHWA received over 2000 comments. Thesecomments are being analyzed and a separate action will address them indetail.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 22, 1988, except for andSection; 383.23,which will be effective April 1, 1992.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ms. Jill L.

Of these, only 12 require State-conducted, behind-the-wheeltesting of all applicants in a vehicle which represents the type whichthe driver operates or expects to operate. The other 20 States waive testingif the applicants meet certain conditions, such as certification of trainingand testing by their employer, and two States recognize training schools.The remaining 18 States and the District of Columbia do not require applicantsto demonstrate their driving skills in the types of vehicles they driveor intend to drive, nor do they require certification of training and testingby the employer or a recognized training school. Drivers in these Stateswho may be qualified to drive only a passenger car may also drive an 18-wheeleror a three-axle intercity bus. The Congress enacted the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (TitleXII of Pub. L. 99-570) to address these problems. Section 12005 of theAct directs the issuance of minimum testing standards to ensure the fitnessof drivers of CMVs. In general, the standards must include written anddriving tests. The written tests must cover the driver's knowledge of Federalregulations related to the safe operation of CMVs contained in Title 49of the FMCSRs (49 CFR Chapter III) and knowledge of the vehicle's safetysystems. The skills tests must be taken in a vehicle representative ofthe type of vehicle that each person operates or expects to operate. Also,the standards must ensure that persons are qualified to operate a CMV accordingto regulations published in the FMCSRs, to the extent that these regulationsare applicable to such persons. In addition, the standards must ensurethat drivers of CMVs which contain hazardous materials are qualified tooperate such vehicles and have a working knowledge of the hazardous materialsregulations. Finally, minimum scores for passing the tests must be established.Section 12006 requires establishment of minimum uniform standards for issuanceof CDLs by States. At a minimum, each person to whom a CDL is issued mustpass written and driving tests that meet the established standards. Also,CDL documents must contain certain information and be tamperproof. Section 12009 delineates requirements with which States must comply inorder to avoid having Federal-aid highway funds withheld. Some of theserequirements are related to issuance of a CDL and must be addressed inthe driver licensing procedures. Generally, these requirements define theconditions which must be met for a State to issue a CDL, the informationa State must provide to the Commercial Driver's License Information System(CDLIS) about its CDL holders, and the checks a State must make of eachapplicant's driving record before issuing the CDL. Section 12011 of the Act provides for the withholding of funds from Stateswhich fail to substantially comply with any of the requirements listedin section 12009(a). This final rule addresses a portion of those requirements.Thus, a State that is not in substantial compliance (throughout FiscalYear 1993 and subsequent years) with this and other regulations issuedpursuant to the Act could lose 5 percent of its Federal-aid highway fundsin Fiscal Year 1994, and 10 percent in later years. At a later date, theFHWA will propose in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, for State and public comment, a definition of``substantial compliance'' and the means of assuring it for the purposesof the withholding provisions of the Act. Throughout implementation of the Act, the FHWA has solicited comment fromthe States, industry, and the general public. These cooperative effortshave helped to ensure the commercial driver's licensing program is effectiveand practical. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requested commentto Docket MC-87-18 on three alternative approaches to establishing testingand licensing programs in consonance with the Act. In addition, the NPRMidentified and sought comment on numerous issues associated with programimplementation. To stimulate public comment and discussion, the FHWA organizedfour public forums_in Washington, DC, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Los Angeles_atwhich 60 persons testified on behalf of a full range of public agenciesand private associations and enterprises. In addition, over 1,200 partiessubmitted comments to Docket MC-87-18.

This will be part of the FHWA's continuing effortsto ensure that the CDL program is practical and effective. Any reductionor elimination of burdens on drivers, States, or motor carriers that maybe realized as part of this assessment would be incorporated into futurerulemaking actions. The rest of this supplementary information section summarizes the majordifferences between the NPRM and this final rule, discusses the FHWA'sselection among the alternative approaches proposed in the NPRM, and presentsa section-by-section analysis of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Major Differences Between NPRM and Final Rule </ITAG>In response to the many public comments on the NPRM, and FHWA has incorporatednumerous changes and refinements in this final rule, all of which are discussedin detail further below. With respect to certain issues prominently raisedin the NPRM or by the respondents to the docket, the FHWA has: (1) Selected Alternative 2 as the basis for the final rule. (2) Eliminated the Commercial Driver's Certificate (CDC), and replacedit_for foreign drivers only_with a ``Nonresident CDL.'' (3) Eliminated the requirement that a State check an applicant's recordwith all other States. (4) Clarified which applicants may, at the discretion of the State, substitutedriving record and other qualifications for their CDL skills tests.(5) Adopted a three-tiered vehicle classification system, based on weightand configuration, and added a passenger endorsement available in all threevehicle groups.(6) Eliminated the air brake endorsement and substituted a restriction.(7) Eliminated the skills test in a tank vehicle.(8) Enhanced the flexibility accorded to the States with regard to knowledgeand skills requirements.(9) Allowed the States the leeway to establish their own knowledge andskills test performance standards.(10) Omitted any specification for CDL document format.The changes listed above only partially reflect the differences betweenthe NPRM and the final rule; the section-by-section analysis presents thespecifics and rationale of all such changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Selection Among Alternative Approaches</ITAG>Development of AlternativesThe Congress passed the Act because of public concern for improving safetyon the Nation's highways. To remedy this concern and to assure the publicthat all CMV operators possess at least the minimum knowledge and skillsnecessary to safely operate their vehicles, the Act directed the Secretaryto develop minimum testing and licensing standards which all States mustmeet. In response to this mandate, the FHWA, in its NPRM of December 11,1987, considered whether to propose specific standards or more generalstandards that would give the States greater discretion in implementingthe testing and licensing programs mandated by the Act. The FHWA decidedto propose two principal alternatives for consideration by the States andother interested parties, and a third alternative that would allow Statesto use either of the two main alternatives.Under NPRM Alternative 1, the States would have to develop and implementa CMV driver licensing program meeting the requirements of the Act withoutspecific directions on program content. A State would be required to submitits testing and licensing plan to the FHWA explaining how its licensingprogram meets the requirements in the Act. The FHWA would then review eachplan to determine whether it is likely to be effective in determining whethera person is qualified to operate a CMV.Under NPRM Alternative 2, the FHWA would issue specific minimum standards,especially with regard to application procedures, the content of basictests, and methods of testing. States would have to meet those specifictesting and licensing standards in order to satisfy the requirements ofthe Act. Under Alternative 2, the States also would have flexibility toexceed the prescribed Federal standards in all areas, and would benefitfrom considerable leeway in implementing many of the prescribed minimumstandards.Under NPRM Alternative 3, each State would elect either to participatein the iterative process described in Alternative 1, or to adhere to therequirements of Alternative 2.In several areas, the FHWA proposed identical provisions for each of thethree alternatives. These areas included the vehicle classifications, licenseendorsements, conditions States must meet to ``grandfather'' certain drivers,and information to be contained on the license document. Thus, while Alternatives1 or 3 would have provided greater flexibility to the States, these alternativesrequired uniform minimum standards in the above areas.Public Response to the AlternativesIn the NPRM, the FHWA solicited comments on the desirability of each ofthe three alternatives. As indicated in Exhibit 1, Alternative 2 garneredstrong support from the overwhelming majority of respondents in virtuallyall categories, including: The NTSB; four-fifths of the States and theDistrict of Columbia; the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators(AAMVA); trucking industry associations, carriers, and the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters (IBT); general trade associations; the insuranceindustry; and public interest groups. Only transit and school bus interestsendorsed Alternative 1 to any appreciable degree.Of the States and the District of Columbia, 40 preferred Alternative 2;five argued for Alternative 1; and five supported Alternative 3. Dual opinionsemerged from the docket responses of two transportation-related agenciesin one State. In compiling these State totals, the FHWA first used thedirect State responses to the NPRM docket. When a State did not submita docket response, or did not address the alternatives issue in its response,the FHWA made use of a survey conducted and submitted to the docket byAAMVA. Thus, the FHWA gleaned 29 State responses on this issue directlyfrom the docket, and 22 State and District of Columbia responses by meansof the AAMVA submittal.<ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit 1._Stratified Tally of Preferences for Alternatives 1, 2,and 3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp0,b2,i1,s10,7,4,4,4,7</C> <H1>Respondent category</H1><H1>Total responses</H1><H1>Preferences by alternative</H1><H2>Alt. 1</H2><H2>Alt. 2</H2><H2>Alt. 3</H2><H2>No opinion</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">NTSB<D>1</D><D/><D>1</D><D/><D/></ITAG>States and D.C.:<ITAG tagnum="3">Direct responses to FHWA</ITAG><D>29</D><D>5</D><D>19</D><D>4</D><D>1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Responses thru AAMVA</ITAG><D>22</D><D>0</D><D>21</D><D>1</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">State/D.C. totals</ITAG><D>51</D><D>5</D><D>40</D><D>5</D><D>1</D>State-related:<ITAG tagnum="1">AAMVA<D>1</D><D/><D>1</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Natl.

Thus, thefinal rule consists of NPRM Alternative 2, as modified in light of thecomments to the docket. These modifications are described in the section-by-sectionanalysis, which appears later in this preamble. Issues and Arguments Underlying the Selected AlternativeIn reviewing the docket, the FHWA identified several major issues bearingon the selection among alternatives. This part of the supplementary informationsection analyzes those issues, and shows how the Alternative 2 approach_asincorporated in the final rule_responds to them in comparison with Alternative1. The comments in favor of Alternative 3 were essentially the same as thosesupporting alternative 1 because Alternatives 3 and 2 differed largelyin the former's inclusion of Alternative 1 as an option open to the States.Three respondents_the NTSB, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA),and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania_asserted that Alternative 3 was inferiorto Alternative 1 because it would establish two completely different administrativepaths for the States and the FHWA. As the NTSB stated, ``Alternative 3raises questions and problems that do not exist if either of the primaryalternatives is chosen. There would be additional administrative burdensas FHWA attempts both to establish national standards and review and approveState plans.'' The ATA likewise opposed Alternative 3 ``because it wouldexacerbate the problem (of lack of uniformity of licensing standards) byallowing two entirely different approaches to the establishment of licensingstandards.'' For all of these reasons, the following discussion confinesitself to the primary choices, Alternatives 1 and 2. FederalismThis regulation has obvious Federalism implications because it will havea substantial direct effect on the States. This direct effect will resultfrom the introduction of statutorily mandated minimum Federal standardsfor the testing and licensing of CMV operators. However, the FHWA has adheredstrictly to the criteria of Executive Order 12612, ``Federalism,'' in writingthis rule. Specifically: (a) The FHWA has closely examined the statutory authority supporting thisaction, and has carefully assessed its necessity. The rule derives itsauthority from the Commerical Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, which requiresthe Secretary to ``issue regulations to establish minimum Federal standardsfor testing and ensuring the fitness of persons who operate commercialmotor vehicles,'' and to establish ``minimum uniform standards for theissuance of commerical drivers' licenses by the States and for informationto be contained on such licenses.'' (Pub. L. 99-570, sections 12005 and12006.) The necessity for this action resides in the need for improvedhighway safety with respect to CMVs. For example, in 1985, medium and heavytrucks were involved in 12.3 percent of all fatal highway accidents, butaccounted for only 4.9 percent of vehicle-miles traveled and approximately2 percent of registered vehicles. Owing to this disproportionate involvementof CMVs in highway fatalities, the Congress found that minimum Federalstandards for State testing and licensing of CMV operators were necessaryto help assure that such drivers have the knowledge and skills necessaryto operate their vehicles safely. Thus, this action is both authorizedand necessary. Moreover, the FHWA has consulted the States and relied heavily on theircollective experience before implementing this action. The NPRM yieldedcomments on the proposed minimum uniform Federal standards from 29 States,and the other States expressed their opinions through the AAMVA. As Exhibit1 indicates, the States and the District of Columbia overwhelmingly endorsedAlternative 2. With the changes introduced in this final rule to augmentthe flexibility available to the States, the FHWA believes that an evenhigher proportion of States will favor the conceptual basis of this rulemaking.Furthermore, the FHWA has constructively addressed many of the commentsto the docket from those States supporting Alternative 1 or Alternative3.(b) Because the CMV safety problem is national in scope, it is necessaryto have the reciprocity among the States that is mandated by the provisionsof the Act. While this action establishes minimum standards for the issuanceof CDLs, it does not in any way alter the basic role of the States in issuingdriver's licenses.(c) While specifying minimum uniform Federal standards for CMV operatortesting and licensing, Alternative 2 grants to the States the maximum administrativediscretion possible. Not only may each State choose to impose its own higherstandards in every facet of the program, but the States will also benefitfrom significant flexibilities in applying the minimum standards. Indeed,the ``flexibility'' section below identifies (in Exhibit 2) 19 sample areasin which the States will exercise considerable latitude within the minimumstandards. (d) The language of the enabling legislation requires the establishmentof uniform national standards for this program. However, the FHWA has carefullyconsidered the comments of the States and their organizations in formulatingthese standards. In addition, the FHWA has worked closely with State officialsin their independent efforts to develop materials and procedures with whichto implement the CDL Program. Federal/State cooperation has also characterizedthe development of the CDLIS, an integral part of the total program. This final rule, based on Alternative 2 in the NPRM, therefore, conformsfully to the letter and spirit of the Federalism Policymaking Criteriaissued by the President. Federal Involvement as Viewed by Respondents The docket responses substantiated the FHWA's assessment of the Federalismimplications of Alternative 2. Only a few responding organizations equatedAlternative 2 with undue Federal interference in internal State prerogatives.On the other hand, at least one respondent argued that the Federal reviewand approval process embodied in Alternative 1 could lead to a more intrusiveFederal presence than would be the case in Alternative 2. Thus, Pennsylvaniaobserved:<ITAG tagnum="21">While on the surface, Alternative 1 seems to provide greater flexibilityfor the States, in reality, there will be minimum standards that FHWA willutilize to judge whether a State's program is acceptable or not. However,these standards will not be openly discussed or developed * * *. Although[Alternative 1] provides the guise of State flexibility, it actually allowsFHWA more latitude in interpreting without State comment what constitutesan acceptable program. A State could make an enormous investment in thedevelopment of a test only to have it rejected * * * because it is deemed``ineffective'' by FHWA. However, ``effectiveness'' is not defined withinthe proposed rules [for Alternative 1]. Therefore, we feel that Alternative2 provides States with more latitude in developing their testing programsby providing [them] with clear minimum guidelines for the program.</ITAG>The Alternative 1 process would require each State to submit a planningdocument for FHWA review by July 15, 1989. The FHWA, in turn, would have90 days to review each plan and issue a determination. The NPRM analysisstates that the FHWA would judge whether each plan is ``likely to resultin an effective program that insures that only qualified driver applicantsare licensed.'' Given the short-time frame to evaluate 51 State and District of Columbiaplans, however, the FHWA would have had to develop a set of ``checklist''criteria against which discrete elements of each State plan would be judged.Consonance With Goals of the Act In issuing the NPRM, the FHWA determined that all three Alternatives wouldaccord with the goals of the enabling legislation. However, the CDL program,far from being a unilateral Federal effort, will succeed or fail due tothe degree of cooperation of a host of parties including the State motorvehicle administrations, carriers, drivers, and trade associations. TheFHWA thus requested public comment on the desirability of each of the alternatives.Most respondents_including the groups critical to program implementation_haveasserted that only Alternative 2 provides the minimum uniform Federal standardscalled for in the Act. Exemplifying these responses, the State of Illinoiswrites: ``Alternative 2 is the only alternative that professionally addressesthe problems which generated (the Act) in the first place.'' By contrast,the respondent organizations overwhelmingly perceive Alternatives 1 and3 as antithetical to the purpose of the Act. A minority of respondents, on the other hand, argued that the latitudeafforded by Alternative 1 would lead to greater compliance on the partof the States. These arguments imply that greater compliance would resultin improved highway safety and would thus be consistent with the goalsof the Act. On the basis of the tally of State opinions, the FHWA believesthat compliance will also result if the rule encompasses the clear preferenceof most State respondents. In addition, the practical concerns discussedfurther below would support the FHWA's view that Alternative 2 could betterpermit the States to focus their resources so as to meet the statutorydeadline for full implementation of the CDL testing and licensing program_April1, 1992. In sum, the FHWA agrees with the majority of respondents that Alternative2 is the better means of meeting the provisions of the Act.Testing Materials and ProceduresSimultaneously with this proceeding, a Committee of States (with FHWA fundingand technical support) has been developing a comprehensive set of commercialdriver testing materials and procedures through a contractor, the EssexCorporation. These Essex outputs had been circulated, in draft form, priorto the NPRM comment deadline. Several respondents misidentified NPRM Alternative2 with the draft Essex outputs: that is, they mistakenly inferred thatFHWA adoption of Alternative 2 would automatically include promulgationof the Essex testing materials and procedures as binding on all States.For example, since the draft Essex materials included a mandatory off-streetdriving skills test, certain respondents incorrectly concluded that off-streettesting_including the provision of potentially costly sites and personnel_wouldbe required of the States under Alternative 2.Such an inference continues to be incorrect, both for the specific off-streettesting example and for the Essex outputs as a whole. The FHWA regardsthe Essex materials as important, but optional, aids for the States toconsider in developing their own testing and licensing programs. Statesmay incorporate all, some, or none of the Essex outputs in their testingprograms, as long as those programs meet or exceed the minimum standardsset forth in this rule. In the example cited above, this rule requiresonly that some or all of the skills test be given in actual traffic conditions.In other words, off-street testing remains an option available to, butnot forced upon, each State. The same principle applies to all other elementsof the Essex program, which may be of maximal utility to States that currentlyhave no classified testing program in place and that do not wish to developtheir own skills and knowledge tests.Flexibility The supporters of Alternatives 1 and 3 adduced as their prime argumentthe additional ``flexibility'' promised by those Alternatives. Commentsby California and Pennsylvania, however, suggest that Alternative 1_withits early FHWA review requirement_would not be as flexible as it mightappear, and Alternative 2 (as modified by the comments by AAMVA and theStates) would offer a high degree of latitude to the States.Exhibit 2 lists 19 examples of flexibility available to the States withinthe minimum standards of the final rule. As requested by AAMVA and severalStates, the FHWA has also revised the knowledge and skills listings ofNPRM Alternative 2 to enhance State flexibility. Knowledge and skills requirementshave been made more general so as to allow the States greater discretionin selecting specific topics for emphasis.In arguing for the flexibility afforded by Alternative 3, the State ofAlaska cited its own unique situation: The existence of many localitiesthat, although physically detached from the State highway network and fromdriver testing facilities, still have CMVs and operators subject to thisfinal rule. The FHWA believes that the waiver process as prescribed inthe Act and in andSection; 383.7 would be the most appropriate forum in whichto address this specific local problem.<ITAG tagnum="85">Exhibit 2._Examples of Flexibilities Offered by Final Rule</ITAG>Each State may * * *(1) Set the price level for the CDL.(2) Set age limits for CDL holders not covered by Part 391 of the FederalMotor Carrier Safety Regulations.(3) Establish the duration of its penalties against driver applicants providingfalse information.

(Section 383.153)(19) Incorporate improved positive identification methods on the CDL. (Section383.153)In addition to the foregoing flexibilities, each State may add more stringentrequirements to the minimum standards contained in all individual sectionsof the rule.CostMost of the States supporting Alternatives 1 and 3 pointed to the allegedlyhigher costs of Alternative 2. In reality, each State will be free to setthe price of the CDL at any level, regardless of the selected Alternative.Furthermore, the ``grandfathering'' and ``third-party testing'' provisionsof the final rule will allow the States to mitigate the impact of initialstartup costs on State budgets. Inferring that Alternative 2 incorporatedthe Essex tests as requirements, certain respondents incorrectly ascribedto Alternative 2 the major capital investment associated with producingoff-street testing sites Statewide. In fact, Alternative 2 did not includeany such requirement, nor does the final rule. Conversely, Alternative1 carried a significant administrative cost burden_preparation, submission,and iteration of the State Plan at an early date. Under the final rule,States will need to plan carefully for program implementation, but theclarity of the standards could lead to more efficient planning than wouldhave been the case under Alternative 1. For all these reasons, cost considerationsdo not argue against Alternative 2 as incorporated in the final rule.ReciprocityThe Act mandates reciprocity among all States. Many respondents arguedthat, given the history of the development of State licensing procedures,one State could hardly be expected to have full confidence in all the otherState programs unless a perceived minimum uniform national standard pervailed.Reciprocity, in turn, will influence State decisions on such issues astransfer retesting. As the approach perceived by most respondents as uniform,Alternative 2 would encourage true nationwide reciprocity including theminimization of the retesting burden.Practical ConcernsIn arguing in favor of Alternative 2, most responding jurisdictions andorganizations cited the practical problems inherent in the Alternative1 process. Although time is of the essence in the CDL program, respondentspointed out, the requirement under Alternative 1 for a State plan, FHWAreview, and possible further iterations would detract from the States'ability to comply with the April 1, 1992, deadline. The paperwork and likelytime delays would create high cost burdens at both the State and Federallevels. By contrast, at least one respondent pointed out that adoptionof Alternative 2 in mid-1988 would give all involved parties_includingCMV operators and their employers_an early warning of the April 1, 1992,requirements, hence a head start on responding to them. One State respondentclaimed that Alternative 2, by advancing specific Federal requirements,could ease the task of pushing enabling legislation through the respectivelegislatures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mechanisms To Assure State Compliance</ITAG>To assure proper implementation of the CDL testing and licensing standards,State compliance must take two forms. First, a State must design an organizationalframework and set of procedures and materials that will allow the standardsto be met. Second, the State must administer the program so that the organization,procedures, and materials actually function according to the program design.In the NPRM, Alternative 1 would have addressed the first form of complianceby producing an FHWA-approved State plan for CDL testing and licensing.By contrast, Alternative 2 would have included neither a requirement forState plans, nor a process for their review by FHWA. The NPRM did not addressthe second form of compliance in any way under either Alternative, exceptto raise the following question for comment:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Is it appropriate for the Governor to certify that the Stateis in compliance? Should the FHWA monitor the licensing procedures and,if so, on what basis? What is the most practical and cost-effective methodthat can be used to certify that the States are in compliance? Should theFHWA approve each of the States' programs? If so, how often should theFHWA review these determinations?</ITAG>In the NPRM docket, 19 States and the AAMVA responded to this question.No consensus emerged from their responses. The largest group of respondents(five States and AAMVA) asserted that State self-certification would suffice,without any subsequent FHWA audit programs. The 14 other commenters embracedten different compliance certification schemes, most of which combinedan initial State certification with some form of FHWA review on an initial,random, annual, or longer-term basis. One respondent suggested initialState certification with a periodic ``peer review'' to be conducted annuallyby AAMVA on behalf of FHWA.Owing to this current lack of a consensus among the States on the importantissue of compliance, the FHWA has elected to defer the establishment ofa compliance certification and/or audit mechanism. In any event, the Actdoes not require full implementation by the States of the CDL program untilOctober 1, 1993, when statutory sanctions would take effect. Thus, ampletime remains to resolve this important issue. The FHWA plans to seek additionalState and public comments on the issue of a compliance certification and/oraudit mechanism by issuance of a future <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. The States, meanwhile, should proceedwithout delay to implement the testing and licensing standards containedin this final rule because CMV drivers must be relicensed under the programby April 1, 1992.The rest of this supplementary section contains a section-by-section analysisof the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 383.5 Definitions.<T3>Commercial motor vehicle (CMV). </T3>The Act (section 12019) defineda CMV, in part, as having ``a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 ormore pounds, or such lesser gross vehicle weight rating as the Secretarydetermines appropriate by regulation * * * .'' This regulation has expandedthat definition to include all vehicles having a gross combination weightrating of 26,001 or more pounds, inclusive of a towed unit with a grossvehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds. The definition changereflects comments received from the AAMVA with respect to vehicle groups.The FHWA agrees with AAMVA that combination vehicles, when hauling 5-tonand greater trailers, merit inclusion in the definition of a CMV becauseof their handling characteristics, even though the gross vehicle weightrating of the main vehicle, if operated without a trailer, may be wellbelow 26,001 pounds. The operator of such a power unit would not have topossess a CDL if the unit is operated without a trailer, or with a trailerhaving a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 10,000 pounds.<T3>Tank vehicle. </T3>In commenting on the NPRM, the National Tank TruckCarriers, Inc., asserted that the use of the term ``cargo tank'' wouldunduly constrain the types of vehicles for which the special dynamics ofbulk cargoes would mandate an endorsement. The FHWA recognizes that ``cargotank'' is a term of art in the hazardous materials regulations; to expandthe definition of this term for the special purposes of Part 383 wouldcreate unnecessary inconsistencies among regulations issued by the Departmentof Transportation. Therefore, the final rule has eliminated the term ``cargotank'' and substituted the term ``tank vehicle.''A tank vehicle must meet the definition of a CMV as provided in this rule.Thus, a tank vehicle must either satisfy the 26,001 pound vehicle weightfloor as specified in andSection; 383.5, or be of any size and be used inthe transportation of materials requiring the motor vehicle to be placardedunder the Hazardous Materials Regulations. Moreover, the tank vehicle mustbe designed to transport any liquid or gaseous material within a tank thatis either permanently or temporarily attached to the vehicle or the chassis.Examples of such vehicles would be cargo tanks and portable tanks.Drivers of vehicles that transport nonhazardous materials (such as milk)in bulk, and that have a weight rating below the 26,001 pound floor, wouldnot require a CDL at all, since the vehicles they operate are not CMVsas defined in the final rule.A tank vehicle required to be placarded by virtue of its hazardous gaseousor liquid cargo would generally be considered a tank vehicle regardlessof its size or weight, and its operator would require the tank vehicleendorsement as well as the hazardous materials endorsement on a licenseappropriate to the vehicle group involved. However, the definition of ``tankvehicle'' specifically excludes portable tanks having a rated capacityunder 1,000 gallons because their dynamic properties do not present sogreat a challenge to driver capabilities as to mandate a tank vehicle endorsement.This exclusion of portable tanks under 1,000 gallons relates to the tankvehicle endorsement only; the hazardous materials endorsement would stillbe applicable in keeping with the placarding requirements of the HazardousMaterials Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_License Requirements</ITAG>Section 383.23 Commercial Driver's License.According to the requirements which became effective on July 1, 1987, driversof CMVs can have only a single license. This section effects additionalrequirements for persons who operate CMVs. As of April 1, 1992, all operatorsof CMVs shall take and pass knowledge and driving tests that meet the minimumstandards promulgated by FHWA. An operator of a CMV with special handlingcharacteristics such as a double trailer combination, or a vehicle requiredto be placarded for hazardous materials, shall also take and pass additionaltests to obtain an endorsement to the CDL authorizing him/her to operatesuch a vehicle. This regulation also requires CMV drivers to possess aCDL while operating a CMV. The CDL shall be issued by States in accordancewith these standards.The Act clearly states that, as of April 1, 1992, at the latest, ``no person''shall operate a CMV unless such person has qualified under the standardscontained in the subject rule. Nevertheless, 10 States in their responsesto the NPRM sought relief from the April 1, 1992, deadline for the qualificationof all drivers. They maintained that this final rule would not be issueduntil July 15, 1988; that additional time would be required for Statesto implement the program through legislative and administrative action;and that States with 4- and 5-year renewal cycles would therefore findit impossible to handle the new CDL program in the normal course of renewalactivity. Moreover, their argument ran, for the States to circumvent thenormal renewal process would entail high overhead costs and would leadto confusion due to the existence of two classification systems. Thus,the concerned States argued, the FHWA should interpret the April 1, 1992,date as a deadline for implementation rather than completion of the CDLprogram.The FHWA fully understands these States' concerns lest the CDL programdeadline lead to temporary higher cost levels and disturb the normal schedulingof license renewals. However, the FHWA believes that the timeframes establishedin the Act are important to maintain as an acceptable goal for compliance.Many States are already moving to adopt and implement the CDL program basedon the dates included in the Act as their goals. Also, the FHWA believesthat changes in the April 1, 1992, deadline, either through legislationor rulemaking, would confuse the drivers and other groups, such as motorcarriers and enforcement entities, who are necessarily concerned aboutwhen and what they need to do as a result of the CDL program. Thus, thefinal rule continues to incorporate this mandated date, and contains severalprovisions that will allow the States_with proper planning and programming_tocomply more easily. First, the FHWA's adoption of Alternative 2 as thebasis for the final rule will permit the States to proceed directly toimplement the CDL program without an iterative Federal review and approvalprocess in 1989. Second, the third-party testing provisions (andSection;383.75) will assist the States in setting up their skills testing apparatuswith minimal expansion of State personnel rosters and facilities. Third,the ability to ``grandfather'' certain highly qualified drivers from theskills tests can ease the burden on State resources. Finally, the finalrule allows the States full discretion to price the CDL. Should a Stateencounter unusual costs in accelerating its license renewal cycle to meetthe April 1, 1992, deadline, it will be free to recover these incrementalcosts through the pricing mechanism. All these features will assist theStates in complying with the April 1, 1992, deadline.Section 12005(a)(8) of the Act allows the Secretary to consider a requirementthat States issue certificates of fitness to operate a CMV to each personwho passes the required tests. The NPRM of December 11, 1987, envisionedthe creation of a CDC document to be issued by States that are in compliancewith this part, so as to fulfill two separate needs. First, a CMV operatordomiciled in a noncomplying State would have been eligible to apply fora CDC from a State which does conform to the testing standards. Second,a CMV operator who is domiciled in a foreign country, and whose home jurisdictiondoes not substantially comply with the testing and licensing standardscontained in this part, would have applied for a CDC from a conformingState.The CDC for domestic drivers elicited nearly unanimous disapproval fromthe respondents to the NPRM, who considered it premature, likely to underminefull compliance, and contrary to the single-license, single-record conceptof the Act. In light of the exemplary cooperation already displayed bythe States in the CDL program, the FHWA agrees that a domestic CDC maynot be necessary, and has deleted it from the regulation. However, in orderto assure that drivers and their employers are not adversely affected bythis regulation due to factors that are solely within the purview of theStates, the FHWA will monitor the extent of State compliance with thisPart, and will deal with this issue, if necessary, in a future rulemaking.Since Canada is working toward a strong testing/licensing program for CMVoperators through its consensus National Safety Code, the CDC for foreignoperators would have probably applied in large measure to drivers domiciledin Mexico (depending on an ongoing analysis of Mexican standards). Thetwo States containing the most heavily trafficked Mexican border crossings,Texas and California, already require Mexican CMV operators to secure Statelicenses. To impose an additional or alternative requirement for a CDCwould needlessly multiply the number and type of documents issued by thoseStates. Moreover, in their responses to the NPRM, both California and Texasopposed the issuance of CDCs and suggested that drivers residing in noncomplyingjurisdictions receive CDLs instead. For these reasons, the FHWA has eliminatedthe CDC for foreign drivers and has substituted a ``Nonresident CDL'' tobe issued by complying States as described and analyzed under Subpart E,``Testing and Licensing Procedures.''To allow novice drivers to obtain the necessary training in a CMV, thefinal rule allows States, if they so choose, to issue limited learner'spermits. The issuance of a learner's permit will not be a required preconditionto issuing a CDL. However, States may choose to make learner's permitsavailable for limited time periods to first-time applicants for use inbehind-the-wheel training on public roads or highways.The NPRM proposed that States which issue learner's permits for CMV driverswould do so as a continuation of their existing learner's permit programsand might also require applicants to pass test(s) prior to issuance ofthe learner's permit for the specific vehicle group or endorsement desired.Conditions for issuance of a learner's permit and circumstances under whichsuch permits may be used would have been solely determined by the Stateof issuance.Of the 51 respondents addressing the question of learner's permits, abouthalf recommended that Federal standards be set for State learner's permitprograms directed toward CDL issuance. For example, the AAMVA urged theFHWA to require that applicants for learner's permits ``satisfy CDL requirementsincluding * * * written and medical exams, and that the record be addedto the CDL Information System.''Responding to such safety-related concerns as AAMVA's, while preservingmaximum flexibility for the States and meeting the behind-the-wheel trainingneeds of prospective CDL applicants, this final rule specifies that a learner'spermit holder must always be accompanied by the holder of a valid CDL duringon-road training. (This provision was suggested by eight respondents inthe trucking and public transit industries and State agencies.) Also, tobe issued a learner's permit in a State for training in a CMV, an applicantmust already possess a valid automobile driver's license, or pass the State'sordinary battery of vision, sign/symbol, and knowledge tests for automobilelicensing purposes.These learner's permit requirements are minimum standards, which the Statescan accommodate within their existing programs. As elsewhere in this regulation,the States will be free to impose more stringent requirements (for instance,making successful completion of the CDL knowledge test a prerequisite forlearner's permit issuance), should they elect to do so.On the other hand, if a State does not issue learner's permits, the requirementsstated in andSection; 383.23(c) will not apply. In such a case, applicantswould have to acquire their behind-the-wheel driving experience on otherthan public highways because of the prohibitions contained in andSection;383.23(a). However, a State not issuing learner's permits may conduct drivingskills tests in traffic. Also, the final rule gives States the additionalflexibility of allowing a person who does not already hold a valid driver'slicense to obtain a learner's permit. A typical situation in which thisoption may be helpful would be that of an individual who immigrates tothe United States from another country and does not have a valid license.Therefore, this final rule does not require States to issue learner's permits,or to issue learner's permits only to valid automobile license holders,in order to implement the CDL program.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Testing and Licensing Procedures</ITAG>This subpart contains the testing and licensing procedures for CDLs. Thetests would be required for each vehicle group in which the applicant operatesor wishes to operate, and would at least cover the general knowledge areasand skills described in Subpart G. Knowledge tests could be given in written,oral, and/or automated format. Skills tests would have to be given in avehicle that is representative of the vehicle group within which the applicantoperates or expects to operate.<T3>Verification of Driver Qualification.</T3> Section 12005(a)(7) of theAct states that regulations for testing of CMV operators shall ensure thateach person taking such tests is qualified to operate CMVs under regulationsissued by the Secretary and contained in Title 49 of the CFR, ``to theextent such regulations are applicable to such person.'' The driver qualificationrequirements found in Part 391 of the FMCSRs apply only to drivers of motorvehicles engaged in <T3>interstate commerce</T3> unless adopted by the State for intrastatemovements. In response to section 12005(a)(7), the final rule will requirethat States include in the CDL application process, a means for an applicantto certify that he/she meets Federal driver qualification requirementsif he/she operates or expects to operate in interstate commerce. Stateswould continue to have the responsibility to establish intrastate driverqualification standards and to determine the applicant's compliance withthese standards. At this time, this regulation does not impose the physicaland medical requirements of section 391 of this part on intrastate driversas a minimum standard.Enforcement of driver compliance with the driver qualifications requirementswould continue under the current practice of roadside inspections, carrieraudits, and other State and Federal enforcement avenues. The driver licenseagencies would also play a related enforcement role by obtaining requiredcertifications, maintaining commercial driver records, completing requiredchecks of these records, and making appropriate notifications to the CDLIS.States would also have the option to have their driver license agenciesassume greater review of driver medical and other qualifications duringthe licensing process.Section 383.71 Driver application procedures.A CMV operator will obtain his/her license in the State in which he/sheis domiciled, except in the case of foreign drivers as explained furtherbelow.Every CDL applicant will, at a minimum, complete the following processto obtain his/her CDL for the first time (other than renewals or transfers):(a) An applicant subject to 49 CFR Part 391 will certify that he/she meetsthe driver qualification requirements of Part 391 as a condition to takingthe tests;(b) Pass a knowledge test (as specified in Subpart G) to demonstrate thathe/she is familiar with the regulations designed to ensure the public safetyand with the skills needed to safely operate the type of vehicle that he/sheoperates or expects to operate;(c) Certify that the vehicle in which he/she will take the driving skillstests is representative of the type of vehicle he/she operates or expectsto operate; (d) Pass the necessary driving skills tests as described in Subpart G;and (e) Provide all information required by the regulation. If he/she satisfies all of the requirements described above, surrendershis/her existing license, and is not disqualified according to SubpartD, then the State may issue the applicant a CDL. Any driver who applies for a renewal of his/her CDL will make the certificationof driver qualification, and provide an update of required information.In addition, holders of the hazardous materials endorsement (andSection;383.123)must pass the hazardous materials test to retain that endorsement. Thehazardous materials endorsement retest will help keep drivers of such vehiclescurrent on changes in the hazardous materials regulations and safety relatedprocedures. As a minimum standard, this rule implicitly permits the Stateto impose additional testing requirements_for example, the full batteryof knowledge and skills tests specified in andSection;383.71(a)_on CDL renewalapplicants. A commercial driver who wishes to drive a vehicle in a different vehiclegroup must make the certification of driver qualification, certify thatthe vehicle in which he/she takes the driving skills tests is representativeof the type of vehicle he/she operates or expects to operate, and passthe tests related to the upgraded vehicle group or endorsement. Any driver who moves (i.e., changes his/her domicile) from another Stateor jurisdiction will be required to apply for a new CDL within no morethan 30 days of moving and to surrender his/her current CDL as a conditionof receiving a new CDL. Such a driver would make the certification of driverqualification and provide any new or updated information required by theregulation. As in the case of CDL renewals, the new State may choose toimpose additional knowledge and skills testing as a prerequisite to thetransfer of a CDL, but is not required to do so. However, if the currentCDL contains the hazardous materials endorsement, and the transfer applicantwishes to retain that endorsement, the new State of domicile must ensurethat the applicant takes a new test or has, within the 2 years precedingthe transfer, either passed a hazardous materials knowledge test givenby the old State of domicile in accordance with andSection;383.121, or successfullycompleted hazardous materials testing or training that is given by an employeror some other third party. Such third party testing or training must bedeemed by the State to substantially cover the knowledge areas listed inandSection;383.121. This provision reflects the FHWA's belief that an individualwho passes a hazardous materials endorsement test or an equivalent thirdparty testing or training program within the 2 years preceding the transferwill be sufficiently knowledgeable of the hazardous material regulationsand of any changes in them which may impact safety. The preceding paragraph will apply to all CMV operators after April 1,1992, and to all CDL holders who change domicile from one CDL-issuing Stateto another CDL-issuing State before April 1, 1992. If, before April 1,1992, a CDL holder moves to a State that does not yet issue CDLs, he/shemust adhere both to the licensing requirements of the new State of domicileand to the single license provisions of andSection;383.21, which requirea driver to surrender his/her old license when he/she receives a licensefrom a new State of domicile. As explained in the analysis of andSection;383.23, the FHWA has eliminatedthe proposed commercial driver's certificate (CDC) for domestic drivers,and has replaced the CDC for foreign drivers with the Nonresident CDL.A foreign driver applying for a Nonresident CDL must complete all the Staterequirements for a CDL. In addition, holders of a Nonresident CDL mustnotify the State of issuance of any disqualifications or license suspensions/revocations,whether in the United States or in the foreign driver's country of domicile.Section 383.73 has been modified in the final rule to add a provision toallow the State to use alternative methods to achieve the objectives ofthe certifications in andSection;383.71(a). This section specifies that Statesmay substitute these alternative methods, where applicable, as part ofthe driver application procedure. Section 383.73 State procedures. This section outlines the procedures which a State will follow, as a minimum,for the issuance of a CDL which meets the requirements of the Act. While the procedures below may appear prescriptive, they are in fact thetypes of transactions and procedures which the States currently utilize.In addition, the AAMVA's Committee on the CDLIS is developing that systembased on these transactions. The use of driver certifications is a commonmethod which States now use to ensure compliance with many rules. The certificationprocess places the burden on the driver applicant to know and comply withthe rule. If the applicant has falsified the certification, the State wouldthen be in a position to take action against the driver. The FHWA believesthat the certification method is the minimum that a State should do toensure compliance with the requirements of the Act. As discussed in thisSection, however, the State would be permitted to use alternative methodsto the certification process. <T3>Initial CDL. </T3>Prior to the first-time issuance of a CDL to a person,a State will: (a) Adopt a program for testing and ensuring the fitness of persons tooperate CMVs in accordance with the standards; (b) Ensure that persons choosing to operate in interstate commerce makethe appropriate certifications regarding their qualifications under Part391 of the FMCSRs prior to being issued a CDL; (c) Issue CDLs only to persons who pass knowledge and skills tests forthe operation of a CMV which comply with these standards; (d) Issue CDLs which contain information and other specifications includedin the standard; (e) For persons moving from another State or jurisdiction, request andconsider the applicant's driving record from the prior State of issuancebefore issuing an initial CDL and require the applicant to surrender his/herexisting license; (f) Not issue a CDL to a person who is disqualified from operating a CMV,or whose driver's license is suspended, revoked, or canceled; (g) Issue CDLs only to persons domiciled in the State' except persons domiciledin a jurisdiction of a foreign country that does not test and issue licensesmeeting the standards may be issued a Nonresident CDL; (h) Notify the CDLIS of the issuance of a CDL and provide the CDLIS withinformation on that driver. (The required information will be discussedin a separate rulemaking or other action on the CDLIS.) <T3>Multiple License and Driver's Record Check. </T3>Section 383.21 alreadyrequires that persons who operate CMVs shall have only one driver's license.Also, section 12009 of the Act requires that a State not issue a CDL toan individual whose license is suspended, revoked, or canceled or who isdisqualified from operating a CMV. To ensure these requirements are metby a driver applying for a CDL, States will check and consider informationin the applicant's current driving record, in the CDLIS and in the NationalDriver Register (NDR) before issuing a CDL. Prior to April 1, 1992, a checkonly of the CDLIS and the NDR may not yield complete information aboutthe driver because he/she does not yet have a CDL and would not be reflectedin the CDLIS. To eliminate this problem, the FHWA proposed in the NPRMthat States check with all other States to determine if the driver is licensedelsewhere. Citing unacceptable administrative difficulties and high costsin terms of personnel, paperwork, and postage, respondents to the NPRMvoiced unanimous disapproval of the 50-State check. In its enforcement activities relative to the single license requirement,the FHWA has also discovered that some current State driver license recordsare not accurate. Many drivers who had moved between States and surrenderedtheir former State driver's license were still shown as holding a licensefrom the former State. The FHWA realizes that the proposal for the 50-Statecheck in the NPRM could generate much inaccurate information about a driver'sformer license. In light of these facts, the FHWA has determined that the 50-State checkis impractical, and has incorporated two safeguards in its stead. First, the applicant must certify that he/she holds only one license andis not subject to any adverse actions against his/her driving privilege.If a falsehood is discovered either before or after issuance of the CDL,this certification is subject to license suspension, revocation, or cancellationas specified in andSection;383.73, as well as any additional penalties imposedby applicable State statutes regarding falsification of information ondrivers' licenses. The FHWA believes that these penalties, combined withpossible disqualification and existing State sanctions for falsifying information,will result in an effective deterrent. Second, the State must check the applicant's record prior to issuing aCDL. Although the CDLIS component of this check will not insure that theapplicant possesses only one license and a satisfactory record prior toApril 1, 1992, it will guarantee that the applicant holds only one ``commercialdriver's license'' and that his/her record as a CDL holder meets minimumstandards. Although the States would not be required by this rule to check the NDRuntil it is determined to be operational by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administrator, it is recognized that the States are exploring thedevelopment of systems which would enable them to access both CDLIS andthe NDR prior to that time. Efforts in this regard are strongly encouraged.<T3>Transfers. </T3>The final rule includes requirements for a person whohas a CDL and then changes his/her State of domicile and applies for aCDL from his/her new State. For these cases, the State will have the optionto accept the credentials of that driver or to require that the driverbe further tested according to its own testing and licensing procedures.At a minimum, the new State of domicile will be required to obtain thecertifications and identifying information updates, and complete the driverrecord checks that would be required for issuance of an initial CDL. The State will also be required to ensure that those drivers who wish toretain the hazardous materials endorsement have either successfully passeda hazardous materials knowledge test within the preceding 2 years, or successfullycompleted hazardous materials testing or training that is given by an employeror some other third party. Such third party testing or training must bedeemed by the State to substantially cover the knowledge areas listed inandSection;383.121. Without such a requirement, the potential would existfor CMV operators who frequently change domicile to avoid retaking thehazardous materials knowledge test for long periods of time. This eventualitycannot be permitted, in FHWA's view, because a CMV operator's hazardousmaterials knowledge is of critical importance to the public safety. MostStates commenting on the retesting of transfer applicants for hazardousmaterials knowledge, however, felt that such retesting should be at theoption of the States. Because the FHWA believes that the States can bestdetermine the knowledge levels of applicants transferring from anotherState, the final rule allows States the option to either retest or acceptcertification of successful hazardous materials testing or training withinthe preceding 2 years by another State or third party, including the employer.This provision reflects the FHWA's belief that an individual who passesa hazardous materials endorsement test or an equivalent third party testingor training program within the 2 years preceding the transfer will be sufficientlyknowledgeable of the hazardous material regulations and of any changesin them which may impact safety. <T3>Renewals. </T3>Minimum State procedures for renewing a CDL will includethe certification of driver qualification, updates of information thatwould be required to be included on the CDL and completion of a check ofthe driver's record. A driver who desires to retain his/her hazardous materialsendorsement will be required to successfully complete the test being givenby the State for the hazardous materials endorsement to ensure he/she continuesto be knowledgeable about hazardous materials regulations and safety procedures.This provision for hazardous materials knowledge retesting at license renewal(as opposed to transfer) received the support of a majority of States commentingon the related question in the NPRM. <T3>Upgrades. </T3>A State will follow a combination of procedures whenevera driver changes the vehicle group in which he/she is currently licensedto operate. The driver applicant will have to provide the certificationsand information specified under the renewal section, and will be testedfor the different portion(s) of the CDL as if he/she were making an initialapplication. <T3>Nonresident CDL. </T3>As explained in the commentary to andSection;383.23,the FHWA has eliminated the CDC for domestic operators, and substitutedthe Nonresident CDL for the ``foreign'' CDC. The Nonresident CDL will bea CDL in every sense of the term. It will differ from all other CDLs onlyin that it will carry the word ``Nonresident'' on its face, and will showan address outside the United States. To be empowered to issue a Nonresident CDL, a State must be fully capableof disqualifying its holder and of withdrawing, suspending, canceling,or revoking his/her Nonresident CDL. This provision is necessary becausecertain States legally require that notifications of certain adverse actionsagainst the driving privilege be delivered by Certified Mail. If a foreigncountry does not participate in the Certified Mail Service the State couldconceivably issue a Nonresident CDL that cannot be suspended, canceled,or revoked. To avoid this eventuality, States wishing to issue NonresidentCDLs may need to modify their statutes and/or regulations to ensure theenforceability of the penalties and sanctions that are integral to theCDL program. <T3>License Issuance and Notification. </T3>This paragraph in the rulespecifies that if the driver applicant has successfully met the requirementsfor a CDL, he/she can be issued a CDL. Once the document is issued, theState will inform the CDLIS and provide it with the appropriate informationwithin 10 days beginning on the date of issuance. The NPRM proposed allowingthe States 30 days to notify the CDLIS of such issuance. The reductionto 10 days reflects an analysis of comments from respondents to the relatedquestion in the docket, most of whom argued that the proposed notificationperiod should be shortened. The 10-day notification period would be longenough to allow the States leeway in processing the required paperwork.The FHWA expects, however, that notification to the CDLIS will be simultaneouswith issuance of the license, to prevent CMV operators from applying formultiple licenses in contravention of law and regulation. The FHWA willaddress this issue further as the CDLIS develops. <T3>Penalties for False Information. </T3>This paragraph contains minimumsuspension, cancellation, or revocation requirements for persons who falsifythe information or certifications required to be provided by CDL applicants.If a State determines at any time that a person falsified the information,the State would at a minimum suspend, revoke, or cancel the CDL no laterthan 30 days after discovering the falsification. The final rule leavesto the discretion of the States the duration of such a suspension, revocation,or cancellation, and allows the States the option of applying additionalcivil or criminal penalties in keeping with existing State statutes. Further,andSection;383.53 provides that individuals who violate the requirementsin Subparts B and C are subject to civil or criminal penalties as specifiedin the Act. Any individual who falsifies license information to obtainmore than one CDL would be in violation of Subparts B and C and would thusbe subject to civil and criminal penalties under the Act. In respondingto the NPRM, the NTSB recommended that the final rule prescribe specificpenalties for drivers who falsely certify compliance with CDL requirements.The FHWA will address this issue in a separate NPRM. To provide an added deterrent, the final rule now explicitly states thatthe penalties can also come into effect if the factual discrepancies arediscovered subsequent to the issuance of the license. These changes fromthe wording in the NPRM reflect the elimination of the 50-State check andthe substitution of a certification; the greater reliance on applicant-providedinformation requires a corresponding clarification of State proceduresin the event of falsification. <T3>Reciprocity. </T3>Section 12009(a)(14) of the Act requires that Statesallow any person who has a valid CDL and who is not disqualified from operatinga CMV, to operate a CMV in the State. The FHWA has included this requirementin andSection;383.73 as a condition for States to issue a CDL which meetsthe standards. <T3>Alternative procedures. </T3>States may implement alternative proceduresto the certification requirements described in andSection;383.71(a), as longas such alternative procedures ensure that the substantive purposes ofthe requirements are met. For example, if a State undertakes the medicalqualification review for the driver, a certification would not be required.This is an area where greater flexibility would be provided to the Statein the final rule than was the case in Alternative 2 of the NPRM. Section 383.75 Third party testing. In keeping with section 12005(c)(3) of the Act, this final rule permitsStates to use a third party to administer driving skills tests. Accordingto the Act, a third party may be a person or a department, agency, or instrumentalityof a local government. The FHWA has decided to allow a broad interpretationof this provision to include another State or any public or private organizationswith which the State has an agreement. Examples of potential third-partytesters would include employers, public transit authorities, school boards,and driver training schools. Approximately 60 respondents to the NPRM (primarily States, members ofthe trucking industry, and public interest groups) addressed this issue.One-fourth of this number either opposed third-party testing outright orsuggested more stringent FHWA-imposed requirements than those originallyproposed. These respondents fear abuses from conflict of interest_for instance,driving schools seeking to upgrade their advertised pass rate, or truckingcompanies attempting to combat the driver shortage by lowering test standards.While recognizing the potential for such abuses, the FHWA also understandsthe benefits of a functioning third-party testing apparatus to assist theStates in implementing the CDL program. As minimum standards subject to State enhancement, the FHWA believes thatthe control mechanisms in the final rule will allow the States to provideadequate checks against abuses. Specifically, in order to ensure that peoplewho pass the tests given by third parties would have passed tests had theytaken them from the State, third parties will be able to give driving testsonly if all the following conditions are met: (a) The tests given by the third party are the same as those which wouldotherwise be given by the State; (b) The State's agreement with the testing party allows the FHWA or itsrepresentative and the State to conduct random examinations, inspections,and audits without prior notice; (c) The State agrees to conduct on-site inspections at least annually;(d) All third party examiners meet such qualification and training standardsas are imposed on State examiners and are relevant to proper administrationof the driving tests (civil service examinations, for example, would notbe required); (e) At least annually, State employees ``check-ride'' with examiners onactual tests, or States test a sample of drivers who were examined by thirdparties to compare pass/fail results; and (f) The State expressly reserves the right to take appropriate action ifthe third party fails to meet the CDL program standards. The FHWA has added this last condition to the requirements enunciated inthe NPRM to further strengthen internal controls in the third-party testingprogram, in response to the concerns voiced by the respondents.Section 383.77 Substitute for driving skills test.The FHWA recognizes the CMV drivers are professionals who are, as a group,highly experienced in the skills needed to operate such vehicles. In responseto the fact, the final rule follows the NPRM in providing States with anoption to allow certain drivers to substitute a good driving record andexperience for the driving skills tests. The overwhelming majority of commentsto the docket from the States and the motor carrier industry support thisprovision. The provision would not be used for the knowledge tests. Theoption would apply to a driver of CMVs who was currently licensed at thetime of his/her application for a CDL, and who either (1) has a good drivingrecord and has previously passed a State skills test in a CMV, or (2) hasa good driving record in combination with certain driving experience. TheFHWA believes that for many current drivers, experience is an appropriateindication that the individual has the minimum driving skills to operatea CMV. Accordingly, the FHWA believes that this provision will not diminishpublic safety or overall safe operation of commercial vehicles.A State which chooses to exercise this option will have to adopt criteriato eliminate certain applicants from consideration under this provision.As a minimum, an applicant must be a CMV operator who is currently licensedat the time of his/her application for a CDL, and must:(1) Certify that he/she has not committed certain offenses; and (2) Certify and show that he/she has previously passed an acceptable skillstest or has certain experience driving a CMV.In the process of developing the NPRM, the FHWA evaluated the practicesused by several States to determine whether applicants who are transferringtheir licenses from another State need to take driving tests. Based onthese current analogous practices and the statutory requirements, the FHWAconcluded that an applicant for ``grandfathering'' would first have tocertify that he/she has violated neither the single license provisionsnor the disqualification provisions in Part 383 for the 2 years prior toapplying for the CDL. In addition, an applicant could have neither a violationof State of local law relating to motor vehicle traffic control (otherthan a parking violation) arising in connection with any traffic accident,nor a record of an accident where he/she was at fault, during the 2 yearsimmediately preceding application for a CDL. The applicant would have hadto pass a State driving skills test given by a State with a classifiedlicensing and testing system, and which was taken by the driver behind-the-wheelin a vehicle representative of the type of classification which the applicantoperates or expects to operate. The State test, in conjunction with a driver'sdemonstrated safe driving record, is an acceptable substitute for a newdriving skills test even if the previous test did not include each of thespecific skill items which new drivers will need to demonstrate under thestandard.In lieu of a driving skills test, the applicant may qualify for an exceptionto the CDL skills test because of his or her prior experience. In thiscase, an applicant would be required to have 2 years of recent experiencedriving a vehicle that is representative of the group of vehicles for whichhe/she wishes to obtain a CDL. A State would need to ensure that the applicanthas this experience through mechanisms such as requiring the employer toprovide certification.The NPRM restricted the pool of applicants eligible to substitute a goodrecord and other qualifications for the driving skills test to those holdingdriver's licenses as of July 15, 1988. Many respondents contended thatsince the deadline for full CDL program implementation is not until April1, 1992, the NPRM would arbitrarily exclude persons with up to 4 years'experience from the skills test substitution provisions. The final ruleeliminates the July 15, 1988, cutoff date, and instead requires that anapplicant hold a driver's license at the time he/she applies for the CDL,and that he/she be regularly employed as a CMV operator.Similarly, the NPRM required that applicants eligible for substitutionof the skills test have a driving record free of license suspensions, revocations,or cancellations, and free of disqualifying offenses, since July 1, 1987.For drivers applying for their CDLs in 1992, this provision would haverequired them to have a good record for almost 5 years. The respondentson this issue generally favored less stringent standards and more discretionon the part of the States. As a result, the final rule has eliminated theJuly 1, 1987, date for all record-related prerequisites to substitutionand has instead specified the 2-year period prior to application for theCDL. Each State would be free to impose more stringent requirements.Several respondents requested that the final rule allow States to allowa substitution for the knowledge test in order not to penalize the safe,but functionally illiterate driver. The FHWA understands this concern;however, the FHWA believes that the purposes of the Act would be best metby retaining the knowledge test requirement for all current drivers. Therule is directed to ``knowledge'' tests, nor ``written'' tests, so as toafford the States alternative ways to provide the drivers with the necessaryinformation and to test them. Illiterate drivers have a handicap in regardto reading, but they can and should be expected to possess the requiredknowledge of safe vehicle oparation. The State will have full discretionto adopt a testing format (or formats) for the knowledge test, as longas the reliability and content standards are met. (See Subpart H.)<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Vehicle Groups, Representative Vehicles, and Endorsements</ITAG>In accordance with section 12005 of the Act, any applicant for a CDL mustdemonstrate driving skills in a vehicle which is representative of thetype of vehicle such person operates or expects to operate. Three broadvehicle groups are established by FHWA to help define the types of vehicleswhich would be considered acceptable representative vehicles. These groupsreflect different vehicle handling characteristics under different trafficconditions and situations. Thus, separate skills and, in some cases, knowledgetests are required for each group. These tests are described in SubpartG.Section 383.91 Vehicle groups.Responses received by FHWA to Docket MC-125 supported classification ofvehicles according to weight and number of articulations points. The AAMVA,the American Automobile Association (AAA), the American Trucking Association(ATA), the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility (HUFSAM), andthe National Motor Carrier Advisory Committee (NMCAC) suggested specificvehicle classifications to FHWA. The vehicle groups included in the finalrule generally follow the recommendations by AAMVA, ATA, and HUFSAM. Thethree vehicle groups delineated by FHWA are depicted in Figure 1.The NPRM had included a ``Bus'' group. However, several comments to thedocket emphasized the significant differences in handling characteristicsamong buses of various sizes and weights. In order to reflect these differenceswithout unduly multiplying the number vehicle groups and increasing thepotential administrative burdens on the States' licensing agencies, theFHWA has eliminated the separate ``bus'' vehicle group and replaced itwith a ``passenger endorsement'' that can be superimposed on the remainingGroups A, B, and C.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-22-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 221</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4910-22-C</ITAG><T3>Representative Vehicles</T3>. Section 12005(a)(2) of the Act requiresthat the skills test be taken in a vehicle representative of the type whichthe person operates or expects to operate. Generally, the commenters toDocket MC-125 leaned toward testing in the type of vehicle the driver intendsto drive. The NTSB recommended that applicants be tested in the largestvehicle allowable in a given class. Such a requirement would place an unreasonableburden on a driver applicant to obtain, for test purposes only, a vehicleother than one he/she typically operates or expects to operate. Alternatively,it would place a burden on States to acquire or to have available suchvehicles for applicants to use for the tests. Thus, the final rule requires an applicant to take his/her skills testin a representative vehicle, defined as<T3> any</T3> vehicle within the vehicle group in which he/she drives orintends to drive. The FHWA believes that the driving tests will adequatelydetermine the ability of the driver to operate any CMV within that group.The applicant will certify to the licensing authority at the time of thetest that the vehicle that he/she uses for the skills tests is a representativevehicle. This approach will give the States flexibility to allow driversto undergo the skills test in vehicles other than the exact vehicle orthe exact type of vehicle which the driver operates or expects to operate.By the same token, this broad definition of ``representative vehicle''will allow drivers to switch jobs without retaking the skills test in anew, more narrowly defined ``representative vehicle,'' except where endorsementsor restrictions are involved. States would also have the option of providingthe representative vehicle for any vehicle group. This flexibility couldresolve problems associated with bringing unique vehicles, such as firetrucks and specialized auto transporters, to the skills test location whileallowing States to require testing with such vehicles if deemed appropriate.As specified in andSection; 383.75, States also have the option of allowingother persons or employers to administer the skills tests. Section 383.93 Endorsements. The endorsements to the CDL included in the final rule are designed toensure that the operators of CMVs with specialized handling characteristicspossess specialized knowledge and skills related to those vehicles. Driversof such equipment must demonstrate this knowledge and skills, in additionto the knowledge and skills required for the basic vehicle group. Endorsementsare required for (1) double/triple trailers, (2) passenger vehicles, (3)tank vehicles, and (4) vehicles that carry hazardous materials in quantitiessufficient to be placarded. For the passenger endorsement, the driver mustpass knowledge and skills tests. For the other endorsements, the driverwill be required to pass a knowledge test only. Accident analyses indicate that the driver's actions and reactions arecausal factors in the majority of preventable accidents involving motorcarriers. The operation of certain heavy trucks and buses also requiresspecific skills and knowledge unique to their configuration, and loadingand handling characteristics. Of particular concern are vehicles that haveincreased articulation points, vehicles which carry cargoes that changethe handling and operating characteristics of the vehicle, or vehicleswhich require unique knowledge to operate safely. Therefore, the FHWA requiresthat operators of such vehicles have knowledge about the safe operationof these vehicles in addition to the knowledge related to the vehicle groups.<T3>Double/Triple Trailers.</T3> The relative incidence of accidents involvingoperation of doubles or triples compared to tractor-semitrailer operationcontinues to be subject to much debate and study. The results of thesedebates and research efforts yield no conclusive results; except that itis clear that there are differences in the operation of double or tripletrailers compared to the operation of tractor-semitrailers. For example,off-tracking of ``twins'' at low speeds has been shown to be significantlyless than that which occurs at low speeds for a tractor semitrailer. Onthe other hand, a vehicle with shorter wheelbases, such as those typicallyused with twins, may be more difficult to control when turns are enteredat high speed. Therefore, the final rule requires drivers who operate or expect to operatedoubles or triples to have an endorsement to their CDL in order to operatethose vehicles. The double/triple endorsement will require a knowledge test only. Skillstesting was not proposed in the NPRM although comment was specificallysought on whether such tests should be required. Those who commented suggestedthat skills testing for doubles and triples would not be so different incontent from that applicable to the combination vehicle group as a wholeas to justify a separate behind-the-wheel examination. It should also benoted that andSection; 391.31 of the FMCSRs already requires an employerto assure that a driver demonstrates skills related to operating the vehiclethat the carrier intends to assign him/her. Since most double/triple operationsare interstate and since nearly all the States have adopted the FMCSRsfor intrastate use or are in the process of adopting them, skills testingfor double/triple operators is largely already being done by employers.If additional skills testing methods, specific to doubles and triples,should be developed by the Essex Corporation under the CDL grant to theState of Nebraska, or by other research, the FHWA would consider whetherthe tests required under andSection; 391.31 and/or this part should be changed.<T3>Passenger vehicles</T3>. Because the requirements for carrying passengersare different from those of other operations, and because the safety systemsof buses are different from those of other CMVs, the FHWA has establisheda passenger endorsement. This endorsement will require a specialized knowledgetest and a skills test taken in a vehicle that is representative of theapplicant's actual or intended vehicle group. Tractor-trailer-type buseswill fall into Group A, while flexible buses will be considered ``straightvehicles'' in Group B, as shown in Figure 1. The operator of a passenger vehicle will be required to take the skillstest in a ``passenger'' vehicle representative of the vehicle group (A,B, or C) for which he/she is applying. The holder of the passenger endorsementwould be allowed to operate the nonpassenger vehicles in his/her vehiclegroup. However, the holder of a CDL<T3> without</T3> the passenger endorsement could not operate a passengervehicle without taking the appropriate knowledge and skills tests. The shifting of the passenger vehicle from a vehicle group, as containedin the NPRM, to an endorsement has a number of advantages. First, it allowsthe basic vehicle grouping to follow the A, B, C grouping recommended bythe AAMVA and a majority of States. Second, it retains the distinctionbetween passenger and nonpassenger vehicle operations. Furthermore, theuse of passenger endorsements to a three-vehicle-group basic license requiresthe driver of a large passenger vehicle to be tested in a large vehicle,and allows a small passenger vehicle driver to be tested in a small passengervehicle. Such a distinction was made in the material submitted to the docketby the Essex Corporation and is similar to the Canadian classificationsystem which separates large and small passenger vehicles. The distinctionamong passenger vehicle sizes should also benefit drivers who may haveaccess only to certain types of vehicles. The FHWA believes that the endorsementis an improvement over the one ``bus'' class proposed in the NPRM for thesereasons.<T3>Tank vehicles. </T3>The FHWA recognizes that tank vehicle operationspresent special concerns. For example, in 1986, there were 818 accidentsreported to the FHWA involving tank vehicles transporting hazardous materialsresulting in 136 fatalities (from all causes), 761 injuries, and over $17million in property damage. In the same year there were 1,276 accidentsreported by tank vehicle carriers or nonhazardous materials, resultingin 142 fatalities, 1,177 injuries and over $17 million property damage.The most important operating difference between driving a tank vehicleand a standard dry freight truck is liquid product surge which may be themost significant condition that a tank vehicle driver must be able to mitigate.Other factors that may threaten vehicle stability, therefore presentinga safety risk, include: sloshing liquids in various tank vehicle designs;various loading conditions; and the impact of liquids on driving maneuverssuch as braking, backing, turning, and combined braking/steering maneuvers.It is important that the drivers of these vehicles be given special emphasisduring the licensing process, and FHWA's standard includes a requirementthat drivers of tank vehicles have an endorsement.As a requirement for the tank vehicle endorsement, the NPRM proposed aknowledge test and a skills test in a half-filled vehicle. The majorityof the respondents to this topic opposed the skills test because it wouldnot simulate typical tank vehicle operations, because test conditions wouldvary significantly among vehicle and landing types, and because such atest could depend on the deliberate creation and successful mitigationof an inherently unsafe situation. Typical of these comments was that ofthe National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc.:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * For an applicant to meet the objective of the proposal (i.e.,recognize the dynamics of shifting cargo and their relationship to vehiclestability), he/she would have to operate the test vehicle in such a manneras to approach the threshold of an overturn or jackknife. It is reasonableto assume that some applicants will cross that threshold, thus the potentialfor compromising the safety of both the applicant and the examiner is evident* * * [furthermore] the vehicle dynamics of different types of trailersmay vary considerably and never replicate the actual type of tank operatedby a (potential) employer.</ITAG>Furthermore, according to the National Private Trucking Association,<ITAG tagnum="21">The load conditions which FHWA proposes to simulate would not be typicalof what drivers experience. Indeed, in the vast majority of situations,tank trucks are operated either full or empty, and companies seek to avoidas much as possible having to operate less-than-full, if for no other reasonthat it simply is not economical * * *</ITAG>The FHWA has embodied all these concerns in the final rule, which eliminatesthe tank vehicle skills test from the minimum standards. The tank vehicleknowledge examination would, however, test applicants' understanding ofthe causes, prevention, and effects of cargo surge, and related topics.Just as in the case of double/triple trailers, employers of tank vehicledrivers are required (in andSection; 391.31 of the FMCRs for interstate commerce,and by many States to assure that drivers demonstrate skills related tooperating the vehicle that the carrier intends to assign him/her. As inthe case of the doubles/triples endorsement, the FHWA intends to monitorthe skills qualifications for tank vehicle operators. If additional appropriatetesting methods are developed by the Essex Corporation or other research,the FHWA will consider whether the tests required under andSection; 391.31should be changed.<T3>Hazardous Materials. </T3>Section 12005(a)(5) of the Act requires thatdrivers of vehicles that carry hazardous materials demonstrate a knowledgeof hazardous materials regulations and emergency procedures. The FHWA hasimplemented this provision of the Act by including a special hazardousmaterials endorsement based on a knowledge test, in the standard. Alsodrivers of tank vehicles transporting hazardous materials would obtainan endorsement both for tank vehicles and hazardous materials.Section 383.95 Air brake restriction.The FHWA's data on equipment-caused accidents consistently show brake defectsas the most frequently reported reason for such accidents. The NPRM treatedair brake knowledge as an integral part of Group A ``Combination Vehicles''(hence, requiring no endorsement), and as an endorsement to all other groups.However, many respondents suggested that the endorsement be eliminatedand replaced with a restriction.Information was also presented to the docket indicating that the vast majorityof straight vehicles above 26,001 pounds are manufactured with air brakes.While most of the vehicles below 26,001 pounds do not have air brakes,the only such vehicles specifically covered by this rule are placardedhazardous material laden vehicles and small buses.In conformance with the comments to the docket, the final rule includesknowledge and skills related to air brakes as part of the basic requirementsfor all vehicle groups since the majority of CMVs subject to this ruleare so equipped. An applicant who either fails the air brake componentof the knowledge test, or performs the skills test in a vehicle not equippedwith air brakes, will only (if found otherwise fully qualified by the State)be eligible to receive a CDL that must contain an air brake restrictionprohibiting him/her from operating any CMV equipped with air brakes. Therestriction is the approach now used by virtually all States to limit driversto specific vehicle or operating conditions. A State may also impose morestringent standards, such as requiring all its CDL applicants to demonstrateknowledge and/or skills in the use of air brakes.To avoid the restriction, the skills test must be performed in a vehicleequipped with an air brake system, or with a hybrid system containing airbrake components. By the same token, the restriction shall apply to allvehicles equipped with air brakes, or with hybrid systems.This approach will promote administrative uniformity across all vehiclegroups, because the States have mechanisms in place to deal with restrictions.There will also be fewer restrictions under the final rule provisions thanthere would have been endorsements since the majority of CMVs are air brakeequipped.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Required Driver Knowledge and Skills</ITAG>This section describes the knowledge and skills which CMV operators wouldbe required to have and demonstrate for each vehicle group and endorsement.Information about these skills and knowledge areas would be included indrivers' manuals available to driver applicants. The FHWA does not expectthat each knowledge test given to each CDL applicant would cover everyspecific item of required knowledge. Rather, the tests would be a representativesampling designed to ensure that the applicant has sufficient breadth anddepth of knowledge to operate his/her vehicle safely. States may also requireknowledge of and include questions related to any unique or special trafficlaws and regulations within their jurisdictions. A sample of the more specificitems on which a State may test to ensure the applicant's knowledge andskills in each general area is included in the appendix to Subpart G.Section 383.111 Required knowledge.A primary cause of accidents is improper vehicle control in adverse environmentalconditions and/or emergency traffic situations. More than 20 percent ofthe preventable accidents involving CMVs are attributable to this cause.Other primary causes of accidents include: Following too closely; failureto maintain control, improper/erratic lane change; improper turning; startingand braking improperly; and failure to yield right-of-away. To ensure thatall CMV drivers are at least aware of these dangers and the correct drivingresponses, an appropriate number of these areas must be covered in questionson the knowledge examinations. Several respondents to the docket, includingthe AAMVA and the States of California and New York, argued that the knowledgeareas included in the NPRM were too rigidly prescribed. Instead, theserespondents argued, the FHWA should list general knowledge areas, and theStates should have the flexibility to determine specific subtopics foremphasis. In an effort to preserve maximum leeway for the States whileassuring minimum uniform Federal standards in keeping with the Act, theFHWA has revised the listing of required knowledge areas to incorporateAAMVA's suggested approach. Thus, the final rule includes general areaswhich must be included on the tests.<T3>Safe Operations Regulations. </T3>Section 12005(a)(4)(A) of the Actrequires that tests ensure that drivers have working knowledge of regulationspertaining to safe operation of commercial vehicles issued under Title49, CFR. To meet this requirement, the final rule specifies that applicantsshall be provided with information about the regulations contained in Parts391 through 397 and shall be tested on this information. This informationis limited to that which a <T3>driver </T3>must have for safe operation of a CMV. The driver is notexpected to have knowledge of subjects, such as vehicle mechanics, whichgo beyond the scope of the information necessary for safe operation ofhis/her CMV.<T3>Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Systems. </T3>Section 12005(a)(4)(B)requires that drivers have a working knowledge of the proper use of thesafety systems of commercial vehicles. As promulgated in the final rule,drivers must have a ``working knowledge'' of such items as proper use oflights, horns, side and rear-view mirrors, proper mirror adjustments, fireextinguishers, symptoms of improper operation revealed through instruments,vehicle operation characteristics, diagnosing malfunctions, and properuse of these safety systems during emergencies.<T3>Safe Vehicle Control. </T3>Section 12005(a)(1) requires that each CMVoperator take written knowledge tests pertaining to safe vehicle control.The FHWA has determined that a CMV operator should have knowledge of theprocedures used to safely operate the vehicles under various traffic androad conditions, and under various weather and lighting conditions.<T3>Relationship of Cargo to Vehicle Control. </T3>The FHWA is also requiringthat drivers have general knowledge about cargo placement, balance, securementand its relationship to safe vehicle operations for the particular vehiclegroup.<T3>Vehicle Inspections. </T3>Pre-trip inspections as well as periodicinspection and repair are important actions which help prevent breakdownsand improve safety. Therefore, the final rule includes a requirement thatCMV drivers must know and understand the various inspection procedures.<T3>Hazardous Materials Knowledge. </T3>This category of knowledge willinvolve basic information regarding hazardous materials, in order to assurethat every CMV operator can at least identify a hazardous cargo and theimplications thereof. For drivers actually transporting placarded hazardousmaterials loads, the essential facts on the basic knowledge test must besupplemented by a special knowledge test for the hazardous materials endorsement.<T3>Air Brake Knowledge. </T3>As discussed in the analysis of andSection;383.93 (Endorsements), knowledge of air brake systems now forms and integralpart of the knowledge test for all vehicle groups.<T3>Combination Vehicle Knowledge. </T3>The FHWA requires that an operatorof a motor vehicle which falls into the Combination Vehicle classification(i.e., Group A) be tested on additional information as part of the basicknowledge requirements. As delineated in andSection; 383.111, this informationaddress coupling and uncoupling, as well as vehicle inspection proceduresthat are unique to Group A.Section 383.113 Required driving skills tests.Section 12005(a) of the Act requires that each driver applicant demonstratehis/her ability to safely operate a vehicle that is representative of theclass or type of vehicle he/she operates or expects to operate. Each driverapplicant will be required to demonstrate the basic skills included inthis final rule; the State may also test any other skills it deems appropriateand necessary. The skills tests will be conducted entirely in actual roadconditions or in a combination of road and off-street conditions. Thus,the FHWA is <T3>not </T3>requiring States to include off-street testing as part ofthe CDL program. The decision as to where the skills test will be conductedwill remain at the discretion of the States, as long as an in-traffic componentis included. Wherever the skills test is conducted, an applicant for aCDL will have to demonstrate that he/she is capable of operating the CMVsafely.Applicants for each vehicle group would be required to successfully demonstratethe basic vehicle control skills, safe driving skills, and air brake skills(except for CDLs which restrict air brake use). The specific skills whichwould be required are contained in andSection; 383.113 (a), (b), and (c).With respect to safe driving skills, most of the respondents supportedthe proposal with some minor wording revisions to allow easier examinerinterpretation. The FHWA incorporated these suggestions into the finalrule. In one case, however, the AAMVA suggested a requirement that applicants``must communicate presence by properly using horns or lights.'' Sincethe test is to taken primarily or exclusively in traffic, and since suchrequired ``communications'' may be unnecessary and distracting to motorists,the FHWA has omitted this suggested addition.In the NPRM, the FHWA elicited opinions on simulator technology in connectionwith the skills tests. The consensus of responses was that, as regardsCMV operations, simulator technology has not yet advanced to a satisfactorystage of development. So as not to preclude further advances in this field,the final rule allows States to use simulator technology as part of theskills testing program, but <T3>not </T3>as a substitute for the required test in traffic.Section 383.115-121 Endorsement tests. The FHWA has determined that an operator of special types of CMVs shallobtain an endorsement to his/her CDL because of the specialized knowledgeand skills needed, in addition to the knowledge and skills contained inandSection;andSection;383.111 and 383.113. Endorsements to the CDL will beprerequisite to the operation of vehicles equipped with double/triple trailers;passenger vehicles; tank vehicles; or vehicles involved in transportationof hazardous materials. Each of the endorsements will require additionalknowledge tests. The passenger endorsement will also require each driverto take and pass a skills test in a representative passenger vehicle. Informationon these knowledge areas and skills will be included in the driver's manuals.The FHWA's specific minimum standards for each endorsement are containedin Subpart G and are summarized below: Section 383.115 Double/triple trailers endorsement. Increased length, larger freight capacity and greater number of articulationpoints lead to differences in handling and performance characteristicsof double/triple trailers. Each applicant will undergo a knowledge testcovering unit assembly and hookup, trailer placement, handling and stabilitycharacteristics, and potential problems of such vehicles in traffic. Skillstest(s) are not proposed for this endorsement because of the administrativedifficulties cited in the commentary on andSection;383.93, because the majorityof double/triple trailer drivers already undergo road tests administeredby employers under andSection;391.31, and because of a lack of evidence asto the specific skills on which a driver can be tested which would be differentfrom the skills required in the basic test(s). Section 383.117 Passenger endorsement. To obtain the passenger endorsement, an applicant must satisfy both knowledgeand skills test requirements. In addition to the basic knowledge test forthe appropriate vehicle group, passenger operators must undergo a knowledgetest pertaining to the operation of passenger transport vehicles and properemergency and braking procedures. Applicants for the passenger endorsementneed take only one skills test. The vehicle used in that test must be abus or other passenger vehicle satisfying the requirements of the specificvehicle group that the applicant operates or expects to operate. Section 383.119 Tank vehicle endorsement. Each applicant for a tank vehicle endorsement must demonstrate his/herknowledge in areas such as vehicle operations under different loadings,product density, tank vehicle type and construction. The driver must alsohave knowledge of and be tested on the causes and prevention of cargo surge,and the likelihood of rollover due to improper control of cargo surge.The NPRM proposed that each driver who wishes to obtain a tank vehicleendorsement to his/her CDL would also demonstrate his/her skills by takinga skills test in a partially loaded tank vehicle (between 30 and 60 percentfull in each compartment). For reasons addressed in the commentary to andSection;383.93,the FHWA has eliminated this requirement in the final rule; nevertheless,for employees subject to the FMCSRs and analogous State regulations, atest in a tank vehicle remains an employer responsibility. Section 383.121 Hazardous materials endorsement. Section 12005(a)(5) of the Act requires that an individual who will operatevehicles carrying hazardous materials shall be qualified to operate CMVin accordance with all regulations pertaining to the transportation ofhazardous materials issued under the Hazardous Materials TransportationAct. The FHWA does not believe that an applicant needs to know all partsof these regulations. For drivers of vehicles which transport non-placardedquantities of hazardous materials, the FHWA believes the questions includedin the basic knowledge test are sufficient. Drivers of vehicles carryinghazardous materials in placarded quantities require additional knowledge.In either case, only those sections of the hazardous materials regulationsthat are essential to a driver's safe operation of his/her vehicle arerequired to be included in the knowledge tests. The applicant will demonstrate his/her knowledge of these areas to obtainan endorsement to his/her CDL as follows: (a) <T3>Hazardous material regulations_</T3>will include the Hazardous MaterialTable, shipping paper requirements, hazardous material packaging, marking,labeling, and placarding requirements; (b) <T3>Hazardous material handling</T3>_will include the different proceduresto be utilized for different kinds of hazardous materials, general loadingand unloading of materials requirements, cargo segregation, and regulationsregarding the routing of materials (in tunnels, on highways etc.), attendanceof vehicles, parking, fueling, and vehicle repair;(c) <T3>Operation of emergency equipment</T3>_will include knowledge of whenand how such equipment is to be used and any other precautions that thevehicle operator must implement to protect the public; and(d) <T3>Emergency response procedures</T3>_will include general knowledge ofappropriate and necessary actions for all types of hazardous materials.The preamble to the NPRM had suggested that this area of the hazardousmaterials endorsement test should include specific knowledge for any typeof freight (the applicant) expects to transport. However, such an impliedstandard would have required a customized test for each applicant, andwould have implied frequent retesting as operators changed jobs or cargotypes. The FHWA has, therefore, removed any mention of driver-specificcommodity knowledge as part of this endorsement.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart H_Tests</ITAG>To ensure that all drivers have the knowledge and skills to safely operatea CMV on the public roadways, every CDL applicant must pass tests whichdemonstrate the person's knowledge or skills described in Subpart G. TheFHWA intends that the tests shall have similar substantive content, andthat test administration and scoring procedures shall meet similar performancestandards, so as to establish valid and nondiscriminatory testing of CMVoperators that is reasonably uniform in substantive results. This sectioncontains the test administration methods and standards for minimum passingscores which the FHWA has adopted for the knowledge and skills tests.Section 383.131 Procedures.Because licensing examinations within a State are given to different applicants,at different times, in different locations, and by different examiners,it is critical to minimize any impact of these differences. Therefore,a State's standard test procedures and methods should be similarly appliedthroughout the State. The CDL program will include procedural informationand directions for the test applicant and for the test examiner. For theknowledge and skills tests, the directions given to the driver applicantwill cover the purpose of the test, how to choose a response, how to makea response, any time limits, and any other special procedures determinedby the State. A State will be free to select a testing format or formats(e.g., paper, oral or automated equipment for knowledge tests) to meetthe State's particular needs. Directions for taking knowledge tests willdiffer depending on the particular testing format(s) used by the States(e.g., written, oral, or automated). All information provided to the applicantwill need to be at or below the six-grade reading level. The FHWA understandsthat this level of reading competency will be sufficient to fully testa driver's knowledge without discriminating based on literacy and believesthat the problems, expressed by some commenters, regarding ``illiteratedrivers'' can be resolved by means of State adoption of several knowledgetesting formats. To that end, the FHWA is working with the AAMVA to developinformation and testing procedures which are geared to drivers with lowerthan sixth-grade reading levels.The information manual(s) furnished by the States to applicants will includethe substance of the knowledge and skills for which outlines are providedin Subpart G of the final rule.Directions for the examiner will include such items as the informationthe examiner must give to the applicant, information about how to conductthe tests, and how to score the tests. Most respondents to the NPRM agreedwith this section of the proposal or made no comment. One respondent didobject to the requirement for manuals, evidently as a reaction to the lengthof the draft Essex Corporation materials. The FHWA believes that the requirementsof this section preserve a high degree of flexibility for the States interms of the contents, structure, and length of the manuals; furthermore,the final rule does not mandate State acceptance of the Essex materials.Because of this flexiblity, and because the vast majority of respondentsraised no objection to this section, the FHWA has preserved it essentiallyintact as proposed.Section 383.133 Test methods.The States will construct and offer tests corresponding to the vehiclegroups and endorsements in Subpart F, and covering general areas describedin Subpart G.The States will be required to establish specific testing and scoring proceduresand the associated administrative procedures that meet the standards. Theknowledge and skills tests will uniformly assess the performance of applicantsregardless of the location of the test.To assure that the knowledge and skill tests can accurately determine theproficiency of CDL license applicants, the tests should be reliable. Inits response to the NPRM, the Essex Corporation (Essex) provided the followinguseful definition of reliability:<ITAG tagnum="21">The reliability of a test * * * is simply an index of the extent towhich a person with a given level of knowledge or skill would make essentiallythe same score in taking the same test a second time, without any interveningstudy or forgetting. Or, it sometimes takes the form of a correlation ofscores made by the same person on two alternative forms of a test, eachof which purports to measure the same knowledge or skills. In the caseof skills tests, reliability can [also] refer to the degree of <T3>agreement</T3> between 2 independent examiners concerning the levelof skill demonstrated by an examine on a test of performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The mathematical index of reliability (correlation coefficient) canrange from .00 which means total lack of reliability to 1.00 which meansperfect reliability. In practice, no test is perfectly reliable * * * itis commonly accepted that written examinations should have reliabilitiesof about .80 or better * * *. [for skills tests] reliabilities as low as.70 may have to be accepted in their everyday practical application * **. Generally speaking, the reliability of a test increases as the lengthof a test is increased.</ITAG>The NPRM proposed that knowledge tests would have a minimum reliabilitycoefficient of 0.90, and that skills tests would have a minimum interexaminerreliability of 0.80. The above comments by Essex, and comments by the Statesof Illinois and Montana, questioned the practicability of such high coefficients.``These requirements,'' Montana stated, ``may exceed the abilities of manyStates at the outset of this program * * *.'' In addition, these specificreliability factors run directly counter to the wishes of the 10 respondentStates which, in supporting Alternatives 1 or 3, placed a high priorityon flexibility. Furthermore, the FHWA recognizes that several States alreadyhave in place testing programs that could serve as a strong basis for compliancewith this final rule, but for which sophisticated statistical analysesand studies may not be available. Finally, the final rule does not requirethe States to adopt the Essex materials, which would in fact be the onlysource readily available to the States for scientifically determined reliabilitycoefficients for CMV skills and knowledge tests. These Essex materialsthemselves are still in the developmental stage as of the writing of thisfinal rule, so that their ultimate reliability results are not yet known.To accord maximum flexibility to the States to modify their current examinations,to adopt the Essex materials, or to develop new tests as they see fit,the FHWA has omitted specific numerical reliability standards from thefinal rule. The rule still places heavy emphasis on the concept of reliabilityon both the knowledge and skills tests; for that reason, the minimum numberof questions for each basic knowledge test has been retained. For the samereason, this section-by-section analysis presents desirable goals for reliability.Each basic knowledge test must contain a minimum, exclusive of the airbrake component, of 30 items covering all of the knowledge areas describedin Subpart G for a given vehicle group. The final rule, in response tonumerous public comments, does not require a minimum number of questionson each endorsement knowledge test. However, each such test must be ofa size sufficient to test a driver's grasp of the related knowledge inthe manual. Each basic and endorsement knowledge test must, moreover, bereliable, to the extent required to assure that each applicant possessesthe knowledge that the test is intended to cover. A desirable reliabilitycoefficient would be the 0.80 mentioned by Essex.A State would have flexibility to choose a specific method for giving theknowledge test as long as the tests meet the performance standards. Forexample, the knowledge tests could be administered by paper and pencil,orally, or given on automated equipment. States may also arrange for teststo be given with an oral interpreter as appropriate. (This would <T3>not</T3> relieve the interstate driver of the language requirementscontained in andSection; 391.11.)Skill tests will have to have sufficient interexaminer reliability to ensuresimilarity of pass/fail rates on tests given by different examiners. AsEssex points out, a practicable coefficient of interexaminer reliabilityof a State's examiners would be 0.70. Of course, a far more desirable goalwould be the coefficient of 0.80 that has been established as a minimumin the <T3>Torque</T3> Tests developed by the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration (NHTSA), and the States are urged to strive to achieve thatgoal.Specific methods for skill testing and scoring would be determined by eachState. For example, the States may use a single score for a right handturn starting with the initiation of the right turn signal and ending followingthe turn and cancellation of the turn signal, or they may use several scoresfor the turn comprised of the different performances involved in a righthand turn (initiates the turn signal, uses appropriate lanes, uses theright side mirror(s), blocks inside traffic, stays in roadway, cancelsturn signal) or they may use some combination of the two approaches. Thelatter approach is a ``disaggregate'' or ``elements'' test approach whichis used in the <T3>Torque </T3>tests.The FHWA requires that the CDL examiners shall be qualified to administerthe knowledge and skills tests. The FHWA expects that States will continueto ensure that their examiners have a high degree of ability, for example,by conducting rigorous training programs, by closely evaluating examiners'performance, and/or by requiring that they hold valid CDLs for the classesof vehicles for which they give exams. States may also require examinersto pass endorsement tests identical to those given to CDL applicants. Althoughspecific qualifications for examiners will remain a State prerogative,the final rule will influence State standards for examiners because achievementof the reliable examinations called for in this section will require notonly good test design but also a high degree of examiner training and ability.Section 383.135 Minimum passing scores.For the knowledge tests, the driver applicant must correctly answer atleast 80 percent of the questions to pass. For the skills tests, the applicantmust successfully perform the skills identified in andSection; 383.113 asbeing required for the standard tests. The State will define ``successfulperformance'' in the course of constructing its tests in keeping with andSection;andSection;383.131 and 383.133. To assure the required interexaminer reliability,the State's definition will have to be precise.Section 383.135(d) specifies the procedure to be employed by the Statein scoring the air brake components of the knowledge and skills tests (andSection;383.133(i)) and issuing the air brake restriction (andSection; 383.95). Ifthe applicant performs the skills test in a vehicle without air brakes,the air brake restriction will be indicated on his/her CDL, if it is issued.If the applicant fails the air brake component of the knowledge test, theair brake component would be removed from the test for scoring purposes,and the air brake restriction would be imposed. For example, if a Stateoffers a 40-question basic knowledge test including 10 air brake questions,and the applicant scores less than 80 percent on the 10 air brake questions,then he/she can still obtain a CDL. He/she will, however, receive the airbrake restriction. Implementing the wishes of most docket respondents,the changes discussed in this paragraph are necessary in order to convertthe air brake endorsement in the NPRM into a restriction, while preservingthe reliability of the basic knowledge and skills tests when taken by applicantswho are not qualified in air brakes.The State will automatically fail any driver applicant who does not obeytraffic laws or causes an accident during the test. The State will determinethe appropriate amount of time an applicant must wait in order to retakeany test which he/she fails. The State would also determine the maximumnumber of times a person may take and fail any test before he/she may beprohibited by the State from obtaining a CDL.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart J_Commercial Driver's License Document</ITAG>This section includes standards for CDLs that are required by section 12006of the Act. Generally, these State-issued documents will be, to the maximumextent practicable, tamperproof, and will include information as describedfurther below.The FHWA included in Alternative 2 of the NPRM a sample set of uniformCDL document specifications which might be used by States. This sampleset of specifications engendered misunderstandings on the part of the Statesand other commenters, many of whom interpreted it as a mandatory componentof Alternative 2. A clear majority of the States responding to this issuewished to retain the freedom to determine the form of the CDL, with onlyminimum requirements in the final rule. Some nongovernmental parties expresseda preference for a uniform, Federally-mandated standard form. Because theStates would be faced with the costs of creating a new form exclusivelyfor CDL holders, the sample specification for the form of the CDL has beenomitted from the final rule. Remaining in the final rule is a list of specificdata items which the States must include on the CDL. These items are basedon section 12006 of the Act.Section 383.153 Information on the document and application.Section 12006 of the Act delineates the information required to be includedon all CDLs. Exhibit 3 compares the CDL contents as specified in the NPRM,and those contained in this final rule. In response to numerous comments,the FHWA has deleted the requirement for weight, eye color, and hair color,all of which can be changed by the applicant. However, States will be freeto collect this information and submit it to the CDLIS.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Exhibit </T4>3._<T4>Commercial Driver's License Document</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Proposed in NPRM</H1><H1>Treatment in Final rule:</H1><H2>Required </H2><H2>Optional \1\</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">``Commercial Drivers License'' <D/>X<D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">``Commercial Drivers License'' or ``CDL''<D/><D/>X<D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Full name <D/>X<D/>X<D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Signature <D/>X<D/>X<D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mailing address <D/>X <D/>X <D/></ITAG>Information to identify: <ITAG tagnum="3">Date of birth </ITAG><D/>X <D/>X<D/><ITAG tagnum="3">Sex </ITAG><D/>X <D/>X <D/><ITAG tagnum="3">Weight </ITAG><D/>X <D> </D><D/>X <ITAG tagnum="3">Height </ITAG><D/>X <D> </D><D/>X <ITAG tagnum="3">Eye color </ITAG><D/>X <D/>X <D>  </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Hair color </ITAG><D/>X <D> </D><D/>X<ITAG tagnum="1">Color photograph <D/>X <D/>X <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Social security number <D/>X <D/>\2\ X <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State license number (if different from Social Security \2\ <D> </D><D/>\2\ X <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Name of State <D/>X <D/>X <D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Date of issuance <D/>X <D/>X <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Date of expiration <D/>X <D/>X <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vehicle groups <D/>X <D/>X <D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Endorsements <D/>X <D/>X <D/><F>\1\ These items are ones that were proposed in the NPRM.

They will also have to show the applicant's Statelicense number on the CDL. If the State uses the SSN as the applicant'slicense number, the SSN must appear on the CDL. If, however, the Statedoes not use the SSN as a license number, the State may choose to omitthe SSN from the license document, but not the CDLIS. In addition to theidentifiers listed in Exhibit 3, the final rule includes standard codesto be used for the vehicle groups and endorsements. The standard codesare intended to provide uniformity for enforcement purposes. While theFHWA proposal included some codes with double letters, many commenterssuggested the use of single letter codes which would be more easily accommodatedon the license document. The FHWA has therefore provided single lettercodes which would eventually make the CMV driver documentation easily recognizableto enforcement officials. For example, a CDL with A-H would be recognizedby enforcement officials across the country to mean the driver is authorizedto drive a combination vehicle and has a hazardous materials endorsement.A nonresident CDL must be clearly labeled as such, although the rule allowsthe States much latitude in the placement of the word ``nonresident.''Also, the rule provides for the air brake restriction, at the States' option.<T3>Combined Endorsement Codes. </T3>The final rule provides an endorsementcode, ``X,'' for those drivers qualifying for both the hazardous materialsand tank vehicle endorsements. This change is made in response to a numberof States which expressed concern regarding the space limitations of theCDL and computer system needed to record endorsements. In addition, therule allows States to develop additional combined endorsement codes providedthat the codes are explained in the CDL itself. <T3>Improved Identification Techniques. </T3>The FHWA and the docket respondentsbelieve that there is room for improvement in assuring positive identificationof CDL holders, but that present technologies are not yet cost-effective.For example, commenters believe that fingerprints, or more likely the thumbprint,cannot be placed on the license document because of space and readabilityafter copying. While there was some interest in retaining prints on theapplication but not placing them on the license, many commenters believedthat without digitizing or other special equipment prints are of littlepractical value. Although the FHWA is aware of ``state-of-the-art'' technologies that maybe available to help identify the driver, such as retinal imaging and digitaldental records, their use is not required at this time as part of the standardbecause of concerns about their costs, benefits, and practicability. TheFHWA and the States will explore these advanced technologies, as well asmodern methods of encoding data such as magnetic strips. As technologyevolves and better, more cost-effective identification means become available,States would be free to impose such methods. The FHWA believes that itwould be premature to include them in this rulemaking. Section 383.155 Tamperproofing requirements. Section 12006 of the Act requires that the CDL document be tamperproofto the maximum extent practicable. A tamperproof license is one which isdesigned, manufactured and/or processed to protect against counterfeiting,forgery, and alteration, i.e., it would be beyond the capabilities of thegeneral public to reproduce or change the document. All State licensingauthorities will be required to use license materials and procedures toreasonably assure that their licenses are tamperproof. At a minimum, eachState will continue to use the same tamperproof method it currently usesfor noncommercial licenses. The FHWA has provided the States flexibilityto use current or future technologies to make the CDL tamperproof. As thetechnology is improved and new methods become cost-effective, the Stateswill be free to improve tamperproof methods. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this action does not constitute a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291. The final rule is not expected to result inan annual effect on the economy of $100 million, or more, or lead to amajor increase in costs or prices, or have significant adverse effectson the United States economy. However, because of the public interest inthe issue of commercial motor vehicle safety and the expected benefit intransportation, this rule is considered significant under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the DOT. For this reason and pursuant to ExecutiveOrder 12498, this rulemaking action has been included on the RegulatoryProgram for significant rulemaking actions. The economic impacts of this rulemaking that will occur are primarily mandatedby the statutory provisions themselves. Since an analysis of impacts, includingeconomic factors, involves consideration of related motor vehicle safetyrulemaking proposals, an overall regulatory evaluation has been preparedfor the various rulemaking actions that will be issued to implement theAct. This evaluation, which addresses some of the provisions containedin the final rule issued on June 1, 1987, and this final rule, has beenplaced in the public docket and is available for inspection in the Headquartersoffice of the FHWA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. A regulatoryevaluation addressing the specific impacts associated with this final rulehas also been prepared and placed in the docket.A significant part of the motor carrier industry and other employers coveredby the Act consists of small firms, from one-person, one-truck operationsof some owner-operators, to the thousands of small fleet operators throughoutthe country. For this reason, the benefit and cost considerations describedin the preliminary regulatory evaluation/initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis as applicable to employers and the motor carrier industry in general,are equally applicable to the small entity component of the industry. Smallentities have been represented at public meetings held to discuss the Actand small entities have had the opportunity to submit comments to the publicdocket established in conjunction with the NPRM.Moreover, the requirement that current drivers obtain a CDL will have onlya slight effect on small entities. As the section-by-section analysis explains,the drivers will be given all needed materials to study for the tests.Current drivers may be able to substitute specific qualifications (a gooddriving record, plus experience or successful completion of an acceptableprior skills examination) for the required CDL driving test. The April1, 1992, deadline provides ample opportunity for employees of small entitiesto comply with this regulation. In terms of efficiency and safety of operations,and the potential reduction of accidents and attendant liabilities, smallbusiness will materially benefit from the standards and controls imposedby the CDL program on holders of CDLs. For example, small entities cannotafford checks of driver's licenses; the CDLIS, and the accumulation ofeach CMV operator's violations on a single record, will produce betterdrivers for small business.As the preceding facts demonstrate, the FHWA is fully committed to doingall that it can to ensure that no undue burdens are placed on small entitiesas a result of this proposal. Conversely, the CDL program will have distinctadvantages to small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork</ITAG>While developing the testing and licensing standards, the FHWA recognizedthat they could impose a major paperwork burden on States and drivers.The FHWA attempted, to the extent practical, to design the final rule tobe compatible with testing and licensing procedures now used by the Statesand to minimize the burden increase. The FHWA, however, believes that anincrease in these burdens will be necessary to accomplish the goals andobjectives of the Act. In the NPRM, the FHWA invited comments and creativeapproaches for reducing the burden without compromising safety. Based onthese comments, the final rule contains several improvements_foremost amongthem, the elimination of the CDC, and of the 50-State pre-licensing recordcheck_that will reduce the paperwork burden on the States from the levelsimplied by the NPRM. While the flexibilities inherent in the final rulewill enable the States further to explore options for simplifying the procedures,minimizing the potential expense of licensing CMV drivers, and developinginnovative testing techniques, there will remain an irreducible volumeof paperwork associated with the CDL program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has carefully reviewed the proposed testing and licensing standardsin light of the purposes of the Act and the President's Executive Orderon Federalism (Executive Order 12612, October 26, 1987). In enacting theCommercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, the Congress found that itis in the public interest to enhance commercial motor vehicle safety andthat minimum standards for States to use to test and license CMV operatorswould help ensure that such drivers have the knowledge and skills neededto safely operate their vehicles. Congress thus identified commercial motorvehicle safety as a matter of national importance and included reciprocityrequirements as part of the mandates in the Act.In his Executive Order on Federalism, the President ordered Executive Departmentsand agencies to be guided by certain fundamental federalism principlesin formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications.These policies have been taken fully into account in the development ofthis regulation, as the following paragraphs indicate. The Act provides the Secretary with clear statutory authority to regulateCMV operators as defined in the Act. This means the operation of CMVs ininterstate commerce as well as intrastate commerce. Thus, the FHWA recognizesthat its minimum testing and licensing standards for CMV operators haveFederalism implications. The Act mandates minimum testing and licensing standards. This means thatStates may continue to adopt and enforce additional testing and licensingrequirements for CMV operators within their State bounds. Also, Stateswill continue to have sole discretion as to whether or not to license anyCMV operator and what specific procedures, tests and fees are applicable.The Federal testing and licensing standards establish minimum safety regulationswhich must be followed by the States and which may be supplemented by theStates. The statutory basis for Federal regulations of CMV operators hasbeen outlined above. Several issues addressed in this final rule, however,involve policies that have federalism implications. These issues have beenaddressed separately above. (See specifically the discussion of alternatives,substitute for skills tests and third party testing.) This final rule limitsthe policymaking discretion of the States only in narrow ways, and doesso only to achieve the national purposes of the Act. Accordingly, it iscertified that the policies contained in this document have been assessedin light of the principles, criteria, and requirements of the FederalismExecutive Order, and accord fully with the letter and spirit of the President'sFederalism initiative. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 383 </ITAG>Commercial driver's license documents, Commercial motor vehicles, Highwaysand roads, Motor carriers licensing and testing procedures, Motor vehiclesafety.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: July 15, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
