To elucidate the character of thisinteraction under controlled fracture conditions, glass fracture mechanicsspecimens were fabricated in the double-cleavage, drilled compressionconfiguration with simple arrays of fibers. Propagating cracks were observedin cross-polarized illumination to characterize delamination of the fiberahead of the crack and bridging interactions behind the crack tip. Stresswave fractography was employed to analyze the shape and relative velocityof the crack front.</TEXT></DOC>
