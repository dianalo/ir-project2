Their ads claim term limits&quot;will lead to higher power rates, diversion of scarce waterresources and oil spills.&quot; No ad yet linking term limits toglobal warming.   Term-limit opponents say that if much of the state'scongressional delegation has to leave office in 1995, thestate will be at the mercy of California congressmen who, notsubject to term limits, will have the clout to stripWashington state of its resources. Governor Booth Gardner,who just ahead of the term-limit sheriff last week announcedhe was leaving politics, says that if Initiative 553 passes&quot;we can certainly kiss reasonable power rates goodbye.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Privately, term-limit opponents admit such fears areabsurd and that California voters will almost certainly limitthe terms of their own congressional delegation next year.But polls told opponents that their only chance of defeatingterm limits was to make the issue California, the region's800-pound gorilla.   Anti-term-limit forces charge that proponents ofInitiative 553 are heavily financed by Citizens forCongressional Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based group. WhileCCR has a few large donors, it is largely funded by $25 orless direct-mail donations. All of the usual Beltwayspecial-interest suspects oppose term limits. Anti-term-limitcontributors include the National Rifle Association($10,000), Philip Morris Inc. ($25,000), the AmericanAssociation of Trial Lawyers ($10,000) and the National CableNetwork ($5,000).   Most of the state's incumbent congressmen haven't beenvocal opponents of term limits -- for good reason. Rep. AlSwift, a seven-term veteran, admits, &quot;I have no credibility&quot;in arguing against being tossed out of office. Last week, hetook the unusual step of announcing he will retire in 1994 sothat his anti-term-limit jeremiads will be believable.   Mr. Swift's careerist colleagues are hoping to ride outthe term-limit wave. At a meeting with lobbyists this June,Rep. Jim McDermott of Seattle was candid about why he ran forCongress. &quot;After I left the state legislature in 1987, I wasburned out and didn't want any more of politics,&quot; he said.&quot;The reason I decided to come back is because I knew I wouldhave a safe seat.&quot;   When he does talk about it, Speaker Tom Foley, whorepresents Spokane, is increasingly bitter in his attacks onterm-limit supporters. &quot;I think it's an unbelievably arrogantsort of contempt for the electorate to say that they haven'tthe right or the ability to make a judgment over who shouldrepresent them,&quot; he says. Term-limit backers respond that itis the incumbents who have effectively taken away choice atthe polls. If term limits pass, voters will be democraticallydeciding to open up the political process to new players.   There's no way of knowing if all the boogie-man storiesagainst term limits are working. Similar tactics last yearhelped reduce support for term limits in California from 68%to 52% on Election Day.   Even if the scare tactics work in Washington next Tuesday,term limits will still be a live issue. Voters in Houston,Cincinnati, Worcester, Mass., and White Plains, N.Y., willvote on term limits the same day. A proper analysis of termlimits will have to include the results of those elections,not just the one where the pols told the scariest stories.</TEXT></DOC>
