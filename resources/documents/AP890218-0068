Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said earlier in the week that theviolations included insider trading in stocks and foreigncurrencies, the sale of nonexistent Treasury certificates, andtrading in securities without clients' consent.   Indicted were Eduardo Legorreta Chauvet, board chairman and ofOperadora de Bolsa, one of the Mexico's two leading trading firms;and Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, the company's director of investmentpromotions. Also indicted were Juan Carlos Fernandez Cueto and JoseFrancisco Rodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones, theother major brokerage firm.   The four men face jail terms of from two to 10 years forviolating the national securites law and from three to 12 years forviolating the federal penal code, officials said.   The indictments were announced during a Saturday news conferencein Mexico's Eastern Penitentiary, where the men are being held.   The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200investors against all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokeragefirms after stockholders incurred losses estimated at $7 million ormore in the October 1987 crash.   Treasury Department officials said they began receivingcomplaints of fraud after the stock market index plunged 74 percentin 28 trading days.   Officials have not said how much money was involved. But GustavoDiaz, president of a group of investors who say they were defrauded,has estimated the brokerage firms netted $43.5 million in profitsfrom alleged illegal trading.   The stock market investigation is part of an overall crackdown onlabor and white-collar corruption in Mexico by President CarlosSalinas de Gortari, a Harvard-educated economist who took officelast Dec. 1.   In January, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, de facto leader of thepowerful Oil Workers Union, was arrested on weapons charges in amassive crackdown on labor leaders.   Hernandez Galicia, known as ``La Quina,'' and 45 others wereindicted on charges of illegal possession of firearms, extortion,embezzlement and corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
