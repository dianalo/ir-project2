Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Because this rule does not imposea new control, it is not subject to the requirements of 13(b) of the EAA.Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking andan opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Accordingly,it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Department ofCommerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments shouldbe submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis,Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, P.O. Box273, Washington, DC 20044.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 533), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. This rule mentions a collection of information requirement subject tothe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and has been cleared under OMB control number 0625-0001.5. The rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 371 and 399 </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
