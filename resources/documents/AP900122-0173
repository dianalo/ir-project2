At the conclusion of a three-day meeting in San`a, primeministers Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani of the capitalist north and YassinSaeed No`man of the Communist south declared that citizens couldcross without hindrance.   They also said all political prisoners would be freedimmediately but gave no numbers.

The statement from the three-day meeting, which was held tooutline steps to merging the countries, also said the twogovernments foresaw a joint body of 33 ministries for the unifiedstate.   The two Red Sea countries have been working for unity for morethan a decade despite the difference in ideology betweenconservative North Yemen and Marxist South Yemen.   But the unity drive gained impetus last year as theSoviet-backed government in South Yemen, following the lead ofother countries, began leaning toward reform.   President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen and South YemeniSocialist Party Secretary-General Ali Salem al-Beidh have decidedthat a joint constitution for the full merger should be prepared bytheir parliaments and put to a referendum in both countries nolater than Nov. 30.   The North Yemeni capital of San`a has been designated as capitalof the united country.   The border regions are rugged, mountainous and mainly inhabitedby tribes. Yemeni citizens in recent weeks have gained automatictelephone access to each other's countries, and there are reportsof plans for a joint television program.   Representatives of the nations today also requested that afinancial and economic committee speed the drafting of single lawsfor customs, currency, banking, taxes and other areas.   Similar instructions were issued to ministries dealing witheducation, judiciary, information, legislation, foreign affairs anddiplomatic representation and the interior.   Asked about adjusting differences in economic systems between arelatively free North Yemen and a socialist South, No`man said ``weshall be bound by the economic principles that will emerge in theconstitution and political will.''</TEXT></DOC>
