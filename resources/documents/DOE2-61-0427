(2) Utilizationof indigenous solar energy in its variety of passive utilization: Irradiation,ambient heat, wind, water power, and biomass. (3) Solar energy importby means of solar hydrogen at the end of the adaption process. Lack ofenergy raw materials will be the main characteristic of these futureaspects. Energy technologies will dominate. (orig.) With 14 figs., 12refs.</TEXT></DOC>
