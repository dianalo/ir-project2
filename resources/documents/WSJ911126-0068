(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- William Taylor, chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., pleaded with Congress to replenishthe bank deposit insurance fund quickly with a $70 billionline of credit, as House and Senate negotiators begandiscussions to resolve differences in their banking bills.   Mr. Taylor urged the Senate Banking Committee to treat therequest as its highest priority, rather than continue toargue over broader questions about how banks operate. &quot;All ofthis is good to discuss,&quot; he said, &quot;but what's essential isto have the money.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   When they met later to begin their conference on thebanking bill, members of the House and Senate agreed on theurgency of rebuilding the Bank Insurance Fund. But theydisagreed on a long list of other details. Senate memberspractically conceded that the compromise bill won't allowbanks to branch nationwide, as their version now provides.And Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) indicated that he's readyto drop his controversial cap on credit-card interest ratesif the conferees agree to a regulatory study of why the ratesare so high.   Several senators expressed regret over the House refusalto accept a bill containing interstate branching. SenateBanking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.)predicted that the failure to enact branching and otherreforms designed to make banks more profitable would increasethe chance that $70 billion in new money for the bankinsurance fund won't be enough to cover the cost of failingbanks.   In a letter to President Bush yesterday, Mr. Riegle saidhe fears that $70 billion won't be &quot;adequate to meet theproblem&quot; facing the nation's banking system. He said &quot;a muchlarger and stronger banking initiative is needed at this timeif we are to avoid a financial accident that would threatenthe entire banking system.&quot; And he called on theadministration to set up a modern version of theDepression-era Reconstruction Finance Corp. to help shore upweak banks.   Mr. Taylor refused to say whether he thinks the $70billion would be enough to handle the current wave of bankfailures. But he said the FDIC needs the money now to give itgreater flexibility in treating banks on the verge ofinsolvency. He said the agency is considering a plan to pumpfunds into nearly insolvent banks, after writing off theirbad loans and possibly changing management. Good loans wouldbe preserved in the community and wouldn't be liquidated withthe rest of the bank. &quot;This is not a plan to defer losses,&quot;he said.   His assessment of bank failures, he said, hasn't changedin the past month, since the FDIC completed its latestprojections. &quot;Certainly in the next 30 to 60 to 90 days thereare {failing} banks that are coming along and, unlesssomething changes, we would be closing those banks,&quot; he said.   On a related problem, the administration's request for anadditional $80 billion to finance the thrift-rescue operationis likely to face an especially big hurdle. To protest theirinability to get a vote this year on their tax-cut plan,House Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver toprevent the bill from even being debated.</TEXT></DOC>
