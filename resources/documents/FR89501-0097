This agencypreviously gave complete notice of its systems of records by publicationin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 2, 1988, 53 FR 34149. This noticeis a summary of more detailed information which may be viewed at the locationand hours given in the ``ADDRESS'' section above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Prefatory Statement</ITAG>Minor Corrections and ChangesThis document reflects minor administrative charges such as location ofthe records and revised statute citations. None of these administrativechanges alter the purposes for which the systems created, nor do they meetother criteria which would require an Altered System report under the PrivacyAct and OMB Circular No. A-130. Therefore, comments are not being solicitedfor these minor non-substantive changes/corrections.Altered Systems of RecordsTwo systems of records are being substantially revised. As required bythe Privacy Act and OMB Circular No. A-130 an Altered System Report forthese systems was submitted on April 25, 1989, to the Office of Managementand Budget, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House.The proposed modifications are as follows:For FCC/OMC-6, Records of money received, refunded, and returned; categoriesof individuals covered is revised to clarify inclusion of employee advancesand unauthorized telephone call reimsursements; categories of records isamended to include Social Security numbers and telephone numbers of individuals,and include administrative changes; routine uses are expanded to includeaccounting for employee advances and to include disclosure to ``debt collectionagencies'' when under contract to the FCC; and finally a new category isadded to revise of general disclosure authority to ``consumer reportingagencies'' pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) (12).It should be noted that the general disclosure authority to ``consumerreporting agencies'' has been determined by the Office of Management andBudget in their Memorandum dated July 5, 1983, not to be subject to publiccomment.
