Over Secord's objections, Chief U.S. District Court Judge AubreyRobinson combined three counts of a March 1988 indictment with ninenew charges handed up by a federal grand jury in April.   The 1988 charges allege that Secord conspired, offered and paidillegal gratuities to Oliver L. North. As a White House aide, Northenlisted Secord to run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua duringa congressional ban on military aid to them.   The nine more recent charges allege that Secord lied to Congressto cover up his own profits in the Iran-Contra affair. They alsoallege that Secord lied to Congress by denying that North receivedbenefits from a maze of companies known as the Enterprise thatSecord and business partner Albert Hakim set up in the affair.   North was convicted last month of three crimes, includingaccepting a $13,800 home security system from Secord.   ``The interests of judicial economy and sound administration ofjustice support consolidation,'' Judge Robinson said in a two-pageorder on the Secord matter.   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, argued against combining the twosets of charges, saying his client should be tried on the 1988charges and that the new indictment should be dismissed.   Green said the indictments ``are not logically related,'' but thejudge disagreed.   Robinson said proof relating to the 1988 criminal charges ``wouldbe admissible to prove'' the nine new charges.   On Thursday, associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten saidthe government would seek dismissal of broad conspiracy and theftcounts against Secord once the other charges were consolidated.   Conspircy and theft counts against North also had been dismissedbecause of national security concerns. Intelligence agencies haverefused to declassify material that would be needed to try thosecharges.</TEXT></DOC>
