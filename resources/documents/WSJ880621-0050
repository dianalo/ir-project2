The dollar was also higher against most other major currencies.    &quot;This is like shooting fish in a barrel,&quot; said J. Thomas Stanley, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group. &quot;It seems like it's a one way bet&quot; the dollar will remain strong.    Traders in Frankfurt said the Bundesbank was selling dollars around 1.7550 marks, a key resistance level, in an apparent intervention to stem the dollar's rise. The dollar fell in response, but quickly recovered and surpassed the levels at which the intervention was reported.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.7608 marks, up from 1.7495 marks late Friday and near the day's high of 1.7612 marks. It was the dollar's highest close against the mark since Oct. 27, 1987, when it finished at 1.7565 marks.    Compared with its performance against the mark, the dollar lagged against the yen, weighed down by the widely held belief that it will meet with heavy resistance as Japanese exporters shed dollar holdings at higher levels. The dollar was quoted late in New York at 126.28 yen, up from 125.75 yen Friday.    In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 126.39 yen.    Since Dec. 31, 1987, when the dollar was at its post World War II low against the West German and Japanese currencies, it has risen by 12% against the mark and 4.4% against the yen.    Traders variously attributed the dollar's strength against the mark and other European currencies to follow-through buying after last Tuesday's announcement of a narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit for April, firm U.S. interest rates, and the perception that the currency hit its lows earlier this year.    Traders said a possible increase in the West German securities repurchase-agreement rate to 3.5% from 3.25%, expected to be announced today, has been discounted by the market and did little to hamper the dollar's climb yesterday.    Statements emanating from the meeting in Toronto of leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations had little or no impact on trading, dealers said.    &quot;The market is getting very bullish on the dollar,&quot; said Joseph Spendly, treasurer at Girozentrale Vienna in New York.    Mr. Spendly and others said corporate customers, who have been largely absent from the foreign-exchange market during 1988, are repositioning themselves in view of the stronger U.S. currency.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $450.70 an ounce, down $3.80. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $451.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, June 20, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
