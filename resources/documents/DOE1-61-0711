Items of significancedealt with in great detail are: Cesium-137, rhodium, palladium, technetium-99,and the applications of ionizing radiation, especially in the food industry.The material collected and evaluated for this study has been used forestablishing a factual database for microcomputer systems which is user-friendlyand flexible and offers a large variety of query formulation and retrievalpossibilities. There are three annexes attached that deal with the existinglegal provisions governing food irradiation in the countries of the EC,with the current knowledge of the wholesomeners of irradiated food, thetechnical safety of irradiation equipment, and with the physical quantities,units, and terminology.</TEXT></DOC>
