Parents FailTo Designate Guardians in Wills---By Alexandra PeersStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   &quot;People are stupid,&quot; says Hank Madden, a financial planner in Jacksonville, Fla. &quot;We make arrangements to will a Jaguar, a mutual fund, a place on the lake, but we don't will our kids.&quot;    Lawyers and estate planners are increasingly urging their clients with children to make detailed guardianship arrangements and to make them earlier in life. Failure to do so, they say, can lead to greater custodial and financial problems than families have encountered in the past.    &quot;In today's world of divorce, stepchildren and strange family relationships, these issues are coming up more than years ago, when families were more like families,&quot; says William Norden, a New York lawyer.    Estate planners estimate that 80% to 90% of parents with young children have no formal instructions specifying who will care for the children in the event of the parents' death and who will manage the children's finances. As a result, decisions fall to overloaded state courts, where battles over custody and money can leave orphans or children of a deceased single parent in limbo for months.    Among families who do make plans, there is a trend toward complicated wills and trusts that seek to cover every possible contingency. Lawyers say they are writing more clauses that, among other things, arrange to compensate guardians &quot;above and beyond the cost of caring for the child,&quot; that express a custodial parent's stance on an ex-spouse's suitability as a parent, or that appoint a second-choice guardian if the first-choice couple divorces or a grandparent dies.    Since state courts generally make the final guardianship decision, there is no guarantee that a parent's or parents' choice of a guardian will be honored by a judge. Still, that choice is weighed heavily, lawyers say. And wills or trusts that spell out a parent's or parents' wishes are more important than ever because courts are moving away from the practice of rubber-stamping guardianship requests.    With the passage of joint-custody laws in most states, &quot;it's no longer automatic that your sister or whoever is the parents' first choice would be the court's first choice,&quot; says Barbara Pope, a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm. Moreover, she says, the courts don't always act swiftly.    In a case in 1985, an orphaned brother and sister, ages nine and 12, whose parents died without a will, were shuttled back and forth between a maternal aunt in Georgia and their paternal grandparents in Pennsylvania, says Lynne Gold-Bikin, a lawyer in Norristown, Pa. For over a year, state courts argued over both the merits of the case and which had jurisdiction. Finally, the grandparents reluctantly opted to give up their attempts rather than subject the children to further dislocation.    In the absence of written instructions, economics may also &quot;play a bigger role than people would wish,&quot; in guardianship decisions, Ms. Pope says. William Shea, a New York lawyer, says it's not always the &quot;relative with the most affection for the children&quot; who receives custody; it's the &quot;one who has the money.&quot;    The high divorce rate has also led to more frequent and complicated guardianship disputes, lawyers say. The death of the custodial parent can open the door for a custody dispute between the surviving biological parent and stepparents or relatives of the deceased parent.    A mother can state her wishes in a will or trust by including a phrase such as, &quot;Under no circumstances do I want my exhusband to have the children,&quot; along with the reasons why. Nonetheless, &quot;nothing can keep the father from going after the children,&quot; says Mr. Shea.    Under most state laws, &quot;the natural parent has paramount right to the children -- but that's not absolute,&quot; says Ms. Gold-Bikin in Pennsylvania. In a guardianship dispute, the judge will decide custody of the children based on the length of the marriage, how involved the biological father has remained in the children's lives, what the children want and what is perceived to be in their best interests. If a stepparent has adopted the children or made them his or her inheritors, the case to retain them is much stronger.    Even in cases in which the selection of a guardian is fairly routine, serious financial problems can arise. If the parents have made no arrangements for inheritance of their estate, a judge usually appoints both a guardian for the children and a separate trustee for their assets who may be unaware of -- and even at odds with -- the parents' and guardian's financial priorities.    In many states, the guardian must hire a lawyer and petition the court annually to be reimbursed for even the most routine child-rearing expenses, such as tax payments and Girl Scout uniforms. Trustees appointed by the court &quot;are usually not as generous&quot; with the children as family members would be, says George Stolberg, senior vice president of Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia. &quot;They'll bend over backwards to make sure principal isn't lost.&quot;    Guardians face a tough time accounting for &quot;every glass of milk and one-quarter of the potatoes you serve at dinner,&quot; says Mr. Norden, the New York lawyer. In a case in Illinois, guardians of a 12-year-old disabled girl received only $5,200 a year for her care. Even though the assets available to the child totaled six figures, petitions by the guardians to increase the amount received were rejected in court.    Estate trustees generally adhere to two rules, or legal tests, in their allocation of funds. The guardian's expenses for the child must be within reasonable limits and must provide for the child's health, education and welfare. But estate planners stress that expenses a parent might well consider reasonable aren't always looked upon as favorably by unrelated officials whose fiduciary responsibility is to protect an estate until a child reaches the age of majority.    In a case in New York, a request by a grandmother to buy a piano for her orphaned granddaughter was denied. Since the child &quot;neither plays the piano nor has she taken any piano lessons,&quot; the court said, the grandmother was to &quot;arrange for the temporary rental of a piano until there is some certainty that piano playing is an interest&quot; of the child.    Parents should plan ahead and include clauses in their wills or trusts that &quot;would allow the guardian to add on to an existing home (or) pay for a housekeeper,&quot; says Paul H. Zuckerman, a trusts and estates lawyer in New York. Additionally, the parent can either arrange to make the guardian and financial trustee the same person with &quot;sole and absolute discretion&quot; over their estate or may designate two different, hopefully compatible, people to provide a cross-check, he says.    Too often, estate specialists add, even parents who make guardianship arrangements don't discuss the matter with the potential guardians. &quot;They're embarrassed or afraid they might say no, or they're afraid to start fights within the family,&quot; says Mr. Madden in Florida.    &quot;Inform everybody&quot; of the arrangements, says Ms. Gold-Bikin. &quot;Otherwise, how are they going to know who takes the children home from the funeral?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
