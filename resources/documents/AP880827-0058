DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Florida braced for heavy rain today and theBahamas warned boaters to stay ashore as a tropical depressiondumped rains on the Caribbean and threatened to strengthen as itmoved over the southern Bahamas.   The weather system, moving west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph, hascaused at least three deaths and forced hundreds of evacuations dueto swollen rivers and mudslides as it moved across the northernedge of the Caribbean on Friday.   At 6 a.m. today, the broad, poorly defined center of thedepression was estimated to be about 225 miles southeast of Miami.   A reconnaissance plane reported highest sustained winds near 35mph, with tropical storm-force gusts of up to 45 mph in squallsover Bahamian waters on the northern edge of the system.   ``These thunderstorms are spreading into the central Bahamas andshould continue spreading into the northwestern Bahamas later inthe day,'' Max Mayfield, a forecaster for the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables, said today.   ``Tonight, this poorly defined center should be near thesoutheast Florida coast, and the scenario now is for it to continuenorthwest toward Florida with the heaviest activity offshore,'' hesaid. ``Even if it were to intensify a little bit, it would stillbe a minimal tropical storm.''   Mayfield said the storm was more likely to brush the southeastcoast and keep the heavy activity off the water, rather thanhitting the Florida Keys directly.   Bahamian officials issued a tropical storm watch for thenorthwestern and central Bahamas, according to the center, advisingsmall craft to remain in port.   If the depression attains tropical-storm strength, it will becalled Chris.   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms and named when theirmaximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, and become hurricanes whenmaximum sustained winds hit 74 mph.   Depressions tend to weaken and become erratic over land, andstrengthen over open waters.   The official Cuban news agency La Prensa said Friday that civildefense authorities in four eastern provinces moved thousands ofpeople to higher ground.   The depression, which began forming Sunday in the centralAtlantic, dumped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in a 24-hourperiod ending Thursday, and then dumped more than 5 inches on theDominican Republic, forecasters said.   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in twoseparate accidents Wednesday when trees crushed their cars as theywere driving along rural roads, police said.   More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged byflooding, including two that were destroyed, according to CivilDefense officials in Puerto Rico. They also reported mudslides anddamaged highways and bridges.   Two tropical storms have developed so far in the Atlantic duringthis year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricanestrength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
