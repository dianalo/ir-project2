AZT has been approved for adults since 1987. Last October,the FDA extended the drug's availability to children throughan experimental distribution program.</LP><TEXT>   Under the program, the drug is provided free of charge bythe manufacturer, Burroughs-Wellcome Co., the U.S. subsidiaryof Wellcome PLC of London. The company distributes astrawberry-flavored syrup version of the drug, instead of thecapsule form it markets to adults.   Dr. Ellen Cooper, director of the FDA's division ofanti-viral products, called the advisory committee's labelingrecommendation &quot;an official statement from the government&quot;that AZT is &quot;safe and effective&quot; for children with AIDS.
