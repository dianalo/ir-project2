On the New York Commodity Exchange, the December-delivery gold contract closed at $476 an ounce, up $5.70 from Friday and up more than $10 since last Thursday. Silver for December closed at $6.95 an ounce, up 28 cents from Friday.    &quot;What has happened up to now after the October crash is that the (precious-metals) market has been trying to decide whether we're going into a deflationary or inflationary market,&quot; said Rajiv Sharma, president of Serco Investments Inc., a Larkspur, Calif. money manager. &quot;What gold might be telling us right now is the odds are better for an inflationary cycle than a deflationary cycle.&quot;    The year's high for the December gold contract is $486.80 an ounce, set the day of the Oct. 19 market crash. However, prices for gold and other precious metals almost immediately plunged in the days after the crash and haven't recovered since, partly on recession fears.    Now, say some analysts, with the U.S. pledged to avoid a recession at all costs, fears of continued European central-bank selling of gold to boost the dollar have dissipated.    &quot;Basically what we're seeing here is a recognition of the effects of lower dollars in months ahead,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, commodity-trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York.    &quot;I believe if the Feds don't restrain the money supply in the next couple of months, the lower dollar will give us a new dose of inflation,&quot; a factor sure to boost precious-metals prices, he said.    Bruce Kaplan, senior vice president at A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif., wholesaler, said: &quot;Since the crash there has been an unprecedented amount of attention focused on how gold retained its purchasing power. I think this . . . has drawn a lot of people into gold.&quot;    In a recent research report, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analysts said the tradition of gold prices reflecting the dollar's movement as &quot;a mirror image . . . has broken down recently,&quot; primarily because of &quot;distress selling&quot; by investors needing to raise cash after the crash, as well as central-bank sales.    &quot;What we really need to get gold moving again is the fear of accelerating inflation,&quot; the analysts said.    Not everyone attributes the rise in gold and silver the past two days to sudden inflation concerns. William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York, said technical factors were at work.    He said he saw a lot of &quot;computer-oriented&quot; buying that kicked in when gold hit $474.50 to $475. Gold-futures options didn't respond to futures' rise yesterday, he noted, &quot;another indication that the rally is really just technical.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Oil prices rose world-wide, hitting the $19-a-barrel mark in the U.S. before closing at $18.78 a barrel, up 22 cents, for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In Europe, North Sea Brent crude gained 20 cents, to $17.95 a barrel. Analysts attributed the gains to traders nervously closing out short positions ahead of next month's Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting, or because of the short holiday trading week. Analysts pinned some of the rise to a Petroleum Intelligence Weekly report that Saudi Arabian oil production for the past few weeks has been 300,000 to 500,000 barrels under its daily OPEC quota of 4.34 million barrels, and may go even lower, a rare piece of news that counters reports of a world-wide oil glut. Otherwise, &quot;there's nothing in the market that would cause such a rise in the price,&quot; said David T. Mizrahi, editor of the MidEast Report newsletter in New York. Mr. Mizrahi said it is significant that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab countries are openly criticizing Iran-bolstering his prediction that cartel members won't be able to come to an agreement at next month's meeting. Meanwhile, Amoco Corp. joined a long list of refiners in lowering by 50 cents the posted price it will pay for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, to $18.    COPPER: Futures prices rose as supplies continued to tighten. December-delivery copper ended 0.40 cent higher at $1.064 a pound, while the March contract rose 2.80 cents to 99.90, after at one point rising to a new life-of-contract high of $1.006. London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks of copper at the close of trading Friday declined 5,975 metric tons to 60,875 tons, the lowest level in 13 years. New York Commodity Exchange warehouse-copper inventories continued to fall, by 1,131 tons as of the opening of trading yesterday, to 38,197 tons. The drop in stocks indicates that the supply situation isn't softening to any major degree and appears to support predictions that the scarcity will continue next year. This is being reflected by the March contract's strength yesterday and the modest advance in the December contract. Traders are switching out of the December contract because it is an expiring month and because margin requirements, or good-faith deposit to buy or sell contracts, on Nov. 30 will rise to 50% of the value of the contract. As the importance of the December contract lessens, the March-May premium is taking precedence over the December-March spread.    COTTON: Futures prices rose as much as their daily two-cents-a-pound limit, before being trimmed by late selling. The first 673 notices to deliver cotton against the December-future contract were quickly accepted, which indicated a strong demand for the commodity, and this helped boost the market, an analyst said. The December contract, which has no limits, rose as much as 3.34 cents before settling 1.52 cents a pound higher at 68.98 cents. Other contract months fell sharply in the late sell-off. The ready acceptance of the large number of delivery notices revived rumors that U.S. exporters had sold cotton to Eastern Bloc countries, according to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities. &quot;The feeling is that trade houses will accept delivery of the cotton to fulfill Eastern Bloc orders,&quot; he said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat-futures prices rose amid growing speculation that China is preparing to buy 400,000 to 500,000 tons of U.S. wheat, said Ted Mao, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. Traders began anticipating such a move last week when the Agriculture Department agreed to compensate grain merchants for the sale of one million tons of U.S. wheat to China at lower world prices. The price of soybean futures slipped as rumored purchases by the Soviet Union failed to materialize. Some traders expect the Soviet Union to buy several hundred thousand more tons of U.S. soybeans or U.S. soybean meal. This month, the Soviet Union has purchased 1.3 million tons of U.S. soybean meal. Although the Soviet Union has been an occasional buyer of U.S. soybeans, until this month it hadn't bought a significant amount of U.S. soybean meal in a decade. The Soviet Union uses soybeans primarily for livestock feed. The price of some corn contracts rose slightly. </TEXT></DOC>
