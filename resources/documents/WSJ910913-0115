Lufkin, who took up horse breedingafter making a mark on Wall Street with the brokerage firmthat he helped start, is saddling up for another ride.   Mr. Lufkin, 59 years old, was named general partner of GKHPartners L.P., a $556 million investment fund in which he hadbeen a special limited partner. He effectively swapped placeswith Harry J. Gray, 71, a former United Technologies Corp.chairman, who reduced his role at GKH to limited partner andspecial adviser.</LP><TEXT>   GKH's other general partners are the Pritzker family ofChicago and Melvyn N. Klein, a Corpus Christi, Texas,investor. A group of large banks, pension funds and otherinstitutional investors make up the bulk of the fund's 22limited partners.   The fund, formed in 1988, so far has limited its activityto a small number of deals, most notably the 1989 leveragedbuy-out of American Medical International Inc., Dallas. Butyesterday, Mr. Lufkin suggested in an interview that the fundis about to become more active.   &quot;Like the groundhog, we think it's time to be looking forthe sun,&quot; said Mr. Lufkin, who was a co-founder of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., now a unit of Equitable LifeAssurance Society of the U.S.   Mr. Lufkin declined to identify specific prospects, butsaid he envisioned &quot;enormous opportunity&quot; now to assistcompanies with financing, given new lending restrictionsamong many banks.   Mr. Lufkin said that for specific individual investments,partners have made additional commitments of capital beyondtheir shares in the fund. He said his own investment in thefund ranged from $5 million to $10 million, but declined todetail the size of investments made by other partners.   Mr. Gray said he maintained his partnership stake in thefund, but declined to describe its size. He said he decreasedhis role because he wanted to &quot;work a little less hard.&quot; InMay, Mr. Gray stepped down as chairman and chief executiveofficer of American Medical Holdings Inc., parent of AmericanMedical, which he led for two years following the buy-out. Heremains a director at American Medical Holdings and chairmanof its board's executive committee.   Besides focusing on philanthropic activities, Mr. Graysaid he would continue to work with the partnership asneeded. He noted that the change would eliminate his votingpower, however. It will also end any personal liability forthe fund's activities, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
