The waste managementscenarios on which most of the studies were based were developed by theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The analyses show that as manyas 500,000-700,000 jobs may be lost in the first year if RCRA SubtitleC rules are applied to drilling fluids and produced waters. As a result,unemployment in major oil-producing states could rise by as much as sixpercentage points. 13 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
