Mary Hatwood Futrell, in a pep talk to the small group of NEAmembers who are Republican delegates, expresed chagrin that thevice president did not seek the NEA's endorsement nor grant herrequest for a private meeting.   Bush was not alone. Most of Bush's former rivals also declinedto fill out the NEA's political questionnaires or sit for avideotaped interview by Futrell.   The union has been an ardent backer of the Democratic candidatein every election since 1976, and an implacable foe of theeducation and budget policies of the Reagan-Bush administration.   Calling hers ``a bipartisan organization,'' Futrell said, ``Ibelieve that there is a broad common ground between NEA and theRepublican Party.''   She said the NEA supports the GOP's calls for high standards andimproved accountability for schools, teachers and students; for agreater emphasis on religious and moral values; and for moreattention to the needs of disadvantaged students.   She didn't mention some other GOP platform positions _ includingsupport for merit pay, tuition tax credits and home schooling _that her union opposes.   The NEA endorsed Michael Dukakis for the Democratic presidentialnomination a few weeks before the Democratic convention. It iswaiting until Sept. 8 to make a formal endorsement for the generalelection, after canvassing the 8,400 NEA delegates who attended itsconvention here last month.   The NEA, which boasted nearly 300 Democratic delegates and 92alternates in Atlanta, has 25 of its members among the GOPdelegates, plus nine alternates, according to a preliminary tally.   The 1.9 million-member union, which estimates that 600,000 ofits members are Republicans, is giving each delegate $1,000 todefray convention expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
