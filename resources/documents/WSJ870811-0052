Amid a shortage of willing teen-age help, Kentucky Fried Chicken plans to hire 1,500 older workers this year. They will be a work-habits and job-loyalty &quot;role model&quot; for young employees, a spokeswoman says. Pizza Hut Inc. will recruit housewives and school teachers. It has hired 100 mentally retarded workers and says it's &quot;very satisfied&quot; with their work.    Some Safeway stores; Cullum Cos., a Dallas drug and grocery store chain; Church's Fried Chicken, and J.C. Penney Co. are seeking retirees, the disabled, or homemakers, often for part-time work. Builders Transport, a Camden, S.C., trucker, recruits women and ex-military drivers. &quot;We need to get competent, safe drivers any place we can,&quot; says Brady Shirley, president.    Many older workers don't want to work and earn too much, fearing they will jeopardize Social Security benefits.    WOMEN WRESTLE with physical tests for some occupations.    Females seeking jobs requiring a degree of physical fitness say they're often given overly demanding performance tests. &quot;Now that the sex barrier is broken, physical qualifications are becoming a bigger issue,&quot; a male federal lawyer says. Suing for three women who bid for Newark, N.J., police jobs, the American Civil Liberties Union said state prowess tests were given in a discriminatory way.    A female Boston police recruit sued to get her job back after she was fired for failing to run an eight-minute mile. But a federal court in North Carolina ruled that Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide didn't violate the law when it refused to hire a woman truck-driver applicant after she had trouble lifting a heavy device that links two trailers. The judge said her small size justified the test.    HIT THE ROAD, but not the road crew or work-zone objects.    Accidents and deaths are climbing in highway-construction areas as road rebuilding and repairs increase. U.S. driving this year is up 6%, and 38 states have raised speed limits to 65 miles an hour. Work-zone fatalities rose to nearly 700 last year from 487 in 1982, and Clarke Bennett, a Federal Highway Administration official, foresees a higher toll this year.    Motorists strike other cars and barriers in work zones twice as often as elsewhere; they may kill more than 100 laborers this year. Some 40,000 work zones exist at any one time on federally aided roads this summer, up 15% from 1986, and motorists frequently ignore the zones' speed limits.    &quot;Give the highway worker a break,&quot; says the state of California, in a work-zone safety drive.    &quot;PROTECTIVE&quot; LAWS for women should be scrapped as unequal, or applied to men, the European Community Commission says. Women in most EC nations can't work in mines or at night in factories. They're banned from &quot;dangerous or unhealthy&quot; work in Belgium and Ireland. Some laws limit women's hours or give more leave.    CORPORATE DEMAND for senior managers softens, a survey of 750 companies by consultant Korn/Ferry International shows. Demand in the second quarter was down an average of 5% from 1986 after a first-quarter average gain of 12%. Many economy-wary companies may soon put new hiring &quot;on hold,&quot; Korn/Ferry says.    JANITORS GET PAID about $8,000 each in back wages and get their full-time, union-contract jobs back in a $725,000 settlement involving Mellon Bank, a cleaning contractor and a Service Employees union local. Mellon hired the nonunion contractor in 1986, and the contractor cut the pay of the 75 janitors, putting them on part-time status without benefits.    JOB SECURITY was the leading worker concern in a survey of 105 personnel officers in 21 industries by Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas Inc., a Chicago placement firm. Over 70% of the respondents picked job worries first, as employers pare work forces. The other concerns, in order, were retiree benefits, child care, AIDS and care for the elderly.    THE PRODUCTIVITY PUSH continues with renewed vigor.    In a survey of 264 Midwest companies by Hay Group, a consultant, 57% named productivity gains and rewards to employees to spur those gains as their top &quot;human resource&quot; issues through 1988. Productivity goals for the coming year averaged 5% to 8%, after 10% gains by most in the past year. Dial Corp., a Phoenix soap maker, expects to raise productivity 5% this year. One method: posting plant productivity counts every two hours.    Massachusetts Financial Services, a Boston mutual fund group, aims to spur &quot;superior&quot; service by convincing employees they're the best; quality work is to be rewarded with money, dinners and baseball tickets. Northrop Corp. credits competing project teams with trimming defects by 20% on its Hornet fighter program last year.    Gains come harder, but &quot;if we keep the target in front of us, we always find a way to meet it,&quot; says Andrew Patti, Dial's president.    THE CHECKOFF: Going modern: The Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees changes its name to the Transportation Communications Union. . . . &quot;The only skilled labor shortage in Cleveland is in the bullpen,&quot; says a long-suffering Indians baseball fan. </TEXT></DOC>
