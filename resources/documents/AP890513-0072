About 4,000 police clashed with protesters who tried to march tothe provincial government headquarters.   ``Down with murder and torture,'' protesters chanted. Sometroops were beaten to the ground by protesters armed with bamboosticks. The crowd burned helmets and shields seized from police.   Police did not stop the estimated 10,000 people from holding arally in a square in front of the government building, even thoughfighting broke out several times.   Dissident leaders called for the overthrow of President RohTae-woo's government as the protesters cheered and clapped,shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo'' and ``End the militarydictatorship.''   Dissident groups organized the march to denounce the death ofthe radical student, Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was found Wednesdayin a reservoir near Kwangju, about 170 miles south of Seoul.   Dissidents claimed at a rally at Chonnam University earlierSaturday that Lee was tortured to death by police interrogators.Police denied any involvement in the death. The government isconducting an investigation.   ``This barbarous act was committed by the suppressive securityforces to suppress the national democratic movement,'' a dissidentleader told the estimated 15,000 people at the university rally.   Speakers called for nationwide protests to topple Roh and expelthe 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defensepact. They claim Roh and the United States are scheming to imposemilitary rule on the country.   ``Roh is the puppet of the U.S. imperialists,'' a student leadersaid. ``Let's fight until we drive out Roh and the Yankees.''   Thousands of people then marched out of the campus and wereblocked by riot police. Scuffles broke out as the protesters triedto force their way through human barricades.   Several elderly protesters beat troopers with walking sticks andpounded their fists against police armored vans blocking the roads.``Kill Roh Tae-woo!'' an old man screamed.   Many marchers then broke away into side streets, reached thecity center and assembled outside the provincial governmentheadquarters for a second rally.   Police reported many minor injuries but said there were noarrests.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of anti-government protestsand strikes in recent months. Dissident groups are calling for theoverthrow of Roh, a former general elected in late 1987.   Dissidents pledged to end violent protests after six riot policewere killed May 3 in a clash with radical students. But thedissidents have not renounced their campaign to topple Roh.   Authorities fear Lee's death could provoke unrest in Kwangju,since it occurred near Thursday's anniversary of the May 18, 1980,Kwangju uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Manyresidents claim Roh is one of those responsible for the bloodysuppression of the uprising.   The dissidents have little public support because of theirviolent tactics and extremism. Roh ordered a major crackdown ondissidents after the death of the six riot police.</TEXT></DOC>
