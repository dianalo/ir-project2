In response to petitions for rule making filed by Forest IndustriesTelecommunications and the Manufacturers Radio Frequency Advisory Committee,a Notice of Proposed Rule Making was released proposing to amend andSection;90.235 of the Rules to permit analog and digital secondary tone signalingin all Part 90 radio services with certain message length and repetitionrequirements. After consideration of the comments, final rules have beenadopted concerning tone signaling operations.2. Over the years, the Commission has authorized tone signaling capabilityin a limited number of Part 90 radio services to provide various point-to-pointalarm and operational functions. Since the Commission cannot find any basisfor distinguishing the tone signaling needs of one radio service from another,it is extending the benefits of secondary tone signaling operations toall Part 90 radio services.3. The new rules establish a maximum tone signaling message duration oftwo seconds which may be repeated three times at any interval. To preventa ``stuck'' tone signaling transmitter from disrupting voice communications,automatic transmitter deactivation is required after an r.f. carrier remainson for more than three minutes or after five tone signaling transmissionsfor the same event. Licensees may utilize tone signaling, on a secondarybasis, for any purpose consistent with the Rules. Existing signaling systemswill be permitted to operate until December 31, 1999 under signaling criteriain effect at the time of the signaling system authorization.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>4.

The authority citation for Part 90 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Section 4, 303, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082; 47U.S.C. 154, 303, unless otherwise noted.</ITAG>2. 47 CFR 90.235 is revised in its entirety to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 90.235 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Secondary fixed signaling operations.</ITAG>Fixed operations may, subject to the following conditions, be authorizedon a secondary basis for voice, tone or impulse signaling on a licensee'smobile service frequency(ies) above 25 MHz within the area normally coveredby the licensee's mobile system. Voice signaling will be permitted onlyin the Police Radio Service.(a) The bandwidth shall not exceed that authorized to the licensee forthe primary operations on the frequency concerned.(b) The output power shall not exceed 30 watts at the remote site.(c) A1D, A2D, F1D, F2D, G1D and G2D emissions may be authorized. In thePolice Radio Service, A3E, F1E, F2E, F3E, G1E, G2E, or G3E emissions mayalso be authorized.(d) Except for those systems covered under paragraph (e) of this section,the maximum duration of any non-voice signaling transmission shall notexceed 2 seconds and shall not be repeated more than 3 times. Signalingtransmissions may be staggered at any interval or may be continuous. Inthe Police Radio Service, the maximum duration of any voice signaling transmissionshall not exceed 6 seconds and shall not be repeated more than 3 times.(e) Until December 31, 1999, for systems in the Public Safety Radio Servicesauthorized prior to June 20, 1975, and in the Power and Petroleum RadioServices authorized prior to June 1, 1976, the maximum duration of anysignaling transmission shall not exceed 6 seconds and shall not be repeatedmore than 5 times. For Power Radio Service systems authorized between June1, 1976 and (effective date of the rules), a signaling message durationshall not exceed 2 seconds and shall not be repeated more than 5 times.Such systems include existing facilities and additional facilities whichmay be authorized as a clear and direct expansion of existing facilities.After December 31, 1999, all signaling systems shall be required to complywith the two second message duration and three repetition requirements.(f) Systems employing automatic interrogation shall be limited to non-voicetechniques and shall not be activated for this purpose more than 10 secondsout of any 60 second period. This 10 second timeframe includes both transmitand response times.(g) Automatic means shall be provided to deactivate the transmitter inthe event the r.f. carrier remains on for a period in excess of 3 minutesor if a transmission for the same signaling function is repeated consecutivelymore than five times.(h) Fixed stations authorized pursuant to the provisions of this sectionare exempt from the requirements of andSection;andSection; 90.137(b), 90.425,and 90.429.(i) Base, mobile, or mobile relay stations may transmit secondary signalingtransmissions to receivers at fixed locations subject to the conditionsset forth in this section.(j) Under the provisions of this section, a mobile service frequency maynot be used exclusively for secondary signaling.(k) The use of secondary signaling will not be considered in whole or inpart as a justification for authorizing additional frequencies in a licensee'sland mobile radio system.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
