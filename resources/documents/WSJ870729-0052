British Columbia Forest, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said the project involves construction of a new paper machine and new pulping and wood-room facilities. When the project is completed in 1989, Blandin's annual capacity to produce lightweight coated ground-wood paper will rise to 500,000 short tons from 280,000 tons. The paper is used by U.S. magazine and catalogue publishers. The project will be financed by a debt issue and cash flow. Construction is expected to begin this fall. </TEXT></DOC>
