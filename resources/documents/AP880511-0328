The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed down35.8 points, or 2 percent, at 1,756.8.   Volume was a hefty 575.5 million shares, compared with Tuesday's397.5 million.   Stock prices opened lower as the market bearishly interpreted acomment from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that majorindustrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike ininterest rates.   The comment, published in European editions of the Wall StreetJournal, pressured London for most of the session.   During the day, the newspaper issued a statement saying it hadfailed to fully report Lawson's remarks.   Meanwhile, Chase Manhattan Bank boosted its prime lending rate ahalf percentage point to 9 percent, the first increase since justbefore the stock market crash in October.   However, Charles Larkham, an equity analyst with the Londoninvestment firm James Capel and Co. Ltd., said: ``We don't thinkit's the beginning of a major lurch lower'' in stock prices.   Another dealer said the rampant takeover talk that had fueledthe London market over the last month had run out of steam.   ``The market had been spoiling for a sell-off for quite sometime and when no takeover bids panned out,'' players liquidatedtheir positions, he said.   A lower finish in Tokyo earlier Wednesday added to the downwardpressure, several analysts said.   A few bargain hunters were spotted late in the day attempting totake advantage of the sharply lower prices, but the market failedto make a significant turnaround, dealers said.   ``Prices didn't have the stomach to bounce back by the end ofthe day as they did Tuesday,'' one dealer said. </TEXT></DOC>
