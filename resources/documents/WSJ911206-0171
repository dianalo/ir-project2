But if the stock market keeps tumbling,precious few of these funds are likely to emerge as bearmarket champs.   The fact is, mutual funds that thrive in both rising andfalling markets are a rare breed.</LP><TEXT>   According to Lipper Analytical Services, there are 31small-stock funds that have been around both for the 1983-90dry spell in small stocks and for the rally that followed.But how many beat the market averages for both periods? Justfive.   One of those five, Acorn Fund, is closed to new investors.But the other four -- Evergreen Limited Market Fund, NicholasII, Putnam OTC Emerging Growth Fund and Sit &quot;New Beginning&quot;Growth Fund -- are still accepting new money.   Because they've done well in both bull and bear markets,these funds are an intriguing investment, says Kurt Brouwer,president of Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a San Franciscoinvestment adviser. &quot;I'm pretty confident that small stockswill keep doing well,&quot; says Mr. Brouwer. &quot;These funds willhave the wind at their back for the next few years.&quot;   All five funds outpaced the Wilshire 4,500 stock indexduring both the lean period for small stocks from June 1983to September 1990 and the subsequent rebound. (The Wilshire4,500, an index of smaller company stocks, is composed ofU.S. stocks that aren't included in the Standard andamp; Poor's500, an index of large-company stocks.)   But these two-time winners are hardly a uniform bunch.Some are far more aggressive than others. For potentialinvestors, it pays to know the difference. The moreaggressive funds are likely to do better if this year'ssmall-stock rally resumes. But if small stocks slip further,then the more conservative funds will probably hold up best.   Acorn, Evergreen Limited Market and Nicholas II fall intothe more conservative camp. The Evergreen fund, which hasjust $51 million in assets, has been closed to new investorsfor much of its eight-year life. But the fund is currentlyaccepting new money, though the minimum is a hefty $25,000.Nicholas II, by contrast, will take people with just $1,000to invest.   &quot;We're always scared,&quot; says Albert Nicholas, manager ofMilwaukee's Nicholas II. &quot;Our favorite saying around here isthat we're short-term cautious and longterm bullish.&quot;   Mr. Nicholas, 60 years old, wasn't always so cautious. In1967, he set up an investment advisory firm with Dick Strong,who later left to launch Strong/Corneliuson CapitalManagement, another fund company. In 1971, Nicholas StrongFund (now called the Nicholas Fund) was the country's topperformer, with a total return of 85.5%. But the fund gotslammed in the 1973-74 bear market, losing 68.6%.   &quot;Before 1973-74, I didn't know what I was doing,&quot; says Mr.Nicholas. &quot;I had no fear of downside risk.&quot;   Mr. Nicholas rethought his investment strategy, and todayhe likes to buy into companies whose stock price is cheaprelative to the companies' per-share earnings. But he doesn'tsimply look for the companies with the lowestprice-to-earnings multiples. Instead, he likes to buy stockswhose P-E multiple is below the company's annual earningsgrowth rate.   Nicholas II, for instance, has been a recent buyer of ADCTelecommunications Inc., which sells communications equipmentto telephone companies, among others. The stock trades atjust 13 times the company's per-share earnings over the past12 months, but Mr. Nicholas reckons the company's earningswill grow at 15% to 20% annually in the years ahead. &quot;Theyare getting more and more heavily involved in fiber optics,and we think that will help them maintain their past growthrate,&quot; he says.   By contrast, the investment style is more aggressive atSit &quot;New Beginning&quot; Growth and Putnam OTC Emerging Growth.The Putnam fund, which charges a 5.75% upfront salescommission, looks for companies whose earnings are likely togrow at an annual clip of at least 17% over the next three tofive years.   And Sit &quot;New Beginning&quot; Growth? The Minneapolis-based fundtypically looks for stocks with an expected earnings growthrate of 15% to 30%, though some of the fund's holdings aregrowing even faster than that.   &quot;You might call it the Minneapolis style,&quot; says DouglasJones, manager of Sit &quot;New Beginning&quot; Growth. &quot;The tone ismaybe set by IDS,&quot; the large Minneapolis fund company ownedby American Express Co. &quot;It's a growth style.&quot;   Right now, Mr. Jones has a quarter of the fund's assetsinvested in health-care stocks, which have been a stockmarket favorite for much of the past three years. &quot;Part ofour enthusiasm is that there's so much doubting out there,&quot;says Mr. Jones. He sees no slowdown in health-careexpenditures. &quot;The decision so far is, nobody can say no.&quot;   Nonetheless, in picking health-care stocks, Mr. Joneslooks for companies that are helping to hold down health-carecosts. One favorite: Medco Containment Services Inc., themail order pharmacy company which distributes prescriptiondrugs through the mail.   Mr. Jones notes that Medco, which trades at more than 60times per-share earnings, has enjoyed explosive growth overthe past few years. &quot;You might think it would be slowingdown,&quot; he says. &quot;But actually, we think {earnings} will grow50% a year over the next two years.&quot;   Despite this year's stock market run-up, the folks at SitInvestment Management believe that small stocks still havefurther to rise.   &quot;The prices may be up, but if you believe the story, itcould go on for a long time,&quot; says Peter Mitchelson, Sit'schief investment strategist. Mr. Mitchelson notes that whensmall stocks have outperformed large stocks in the past, theyhave done so for as long as a decade. &quot;We keep looking at thenumbers,&quot; he says, &quot;and that gives us courage.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
