The Richmond, Va., transportation company said it intends to buy at least 40 million of the tendered shares at $32 each.    CSX in September had invited shareholders to tender shares at prices ranging from $28 to $33 a share.    The repurchase is part of a restructuring plan under which the company authorized the buy-back of as many as 60 million CSX shares, or about 38% of the shares outstanding. The remainder of the shares may be purchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The plan also includes the sale of certain properties and the company's natural gas transmission and natural gas liquids processing business.    CSX intends to focus on its rail, barge, trucking and ocean ship transportation businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
