Shultz today urged theleaders of more than 140 countries to foreswear using chemicalweapons and to keep them out of the hands of terrorists.   Addressing the first session of an international conference onchemical weapons, Shultz proposed the imposition of unspecifiedpenalties by the United Nations to those violating the 1925 GenevaProtocol banning the use of ``one of humanity's most dreaded anddreadful forms of warfare.''   Shultz warned that the threat of terrorists using chemicalweapons is ``a real one'' and said some governments linked toterrorism have the ability to produce deadly chemical agents.   ``There are no insurmountable technical obstacles that wouldprevent terrorist groups from using chemical weapons,'' Shultz toldthe conference delegates.   Shultz did not specify any particular country, but it appearedLibya was at least one of his targets when he said, ``Somegovernments which have been known to sponsor terrorism now havesizable chemical weapons capabilities.''   Libya is among the countries on the State Department's list ofnations sponsoring terrorism. Syria is also on the list, and someanalysts fear the country also may have embarked on a chemicalsweapon program.   ``With the inhibitions against employing such weapons nowweakened through recent years _ and with targets for conventionalterrorist attacks becoming better protected _ terrorist groups couldbe tempted to shift without warning to use of chemical weapons fordramatic political and media attention,'' he said.   Shultz also supported increasing in the U.N. secretary-general'sauthority to investigate allegations into the use of chemical armsin war, and said nations must find ways to block the transfer oftechnology.   He made no direct reference to Libya, nor did he single out anyother nation believed to possess or have the ability to producechemical weapons. Only the United States and the Soviet Unionacknowledge having such stockpiles.   U.S. officials maintain chemical weapons are being developed at aplant 60 miles from the Libyan capital. Libya denies it.   However, the U.S. secretary of state said chemical weapons haveproliferated in recent years. He cited reports of the use ofchemical arms in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Afghanistan.   ``We cannot delay. Time is not on our side,'' he said.``Technology is not stagnant. Ever more lethal and insidiouschemical weapons are being developed ... the ability to produce suchweapons is rapidly spreading and with it the technology to produceballistic missiles as delivery vehicles.''   Shultz said it was, ``grimly ironic'' that the threat of chemicalweapons has grown just as progress is being made in controlling andreducing nuclear arms.   ``A nightmare for all, of course, would be the combination ofballistic missiles, chemical warheads and biological weapons in thehands of governments with histories of the conduct of terroristviolence.''   In opening the five-day conference today, President FrancoisMitterrand of France told delegates: ``This conference is not goingto be a court of justice. However, you should state unconditionallyand unreservedly your condemnation of chemical arms.''   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asked for a minuteof silence to honor Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who died today. Morethan 140 nations were represented _ including 80 by their foreignministers _ at the meeting at the headquarters of the U.N.Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization.   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 Geneva Protocol,banning use of chemical arms, and pressing for a broader agreementthat would prohibit their use, production and stockpiling.   The emnity between the United States and Libya loomed over theconference, as the United States pressed its accusations aboutLibyan chemical weapons capabilities, trying to persuadeindustrialized nations the claims are correct.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Friday thatthe U.S. downing of two Libyan jetfighters ``poisoned'' theatmosphere of the meeting.   U.S. officials say two U.S. planes shot down two Libyan planesover the Mediterranean in self-defense Wednesday. The officials alsosay the issue of a Libyan chemical plant on the verge of productionhad nothing to do with the air incident.   Libya claims its chemical plant, in Rabta 60 miles southwest ofTripoli, is for making pharmaceuticals.   Shultz and Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher of WestGermany agreed today that U.S. and West German experts would meetnext week in Washington to weigh any evidence West German firms areinvolved in the factory in Rabta.   ``We will do everything in our power to prevent German nationalsand German companies from taking part in chemical weaponsproduction,'' Genscher said.   Some published reports have linked a West German firm to theLibyan plant, but the Bonn government has expressed skepticism.   For nearly two decades, negotiators in Geneva have worked withoutsuccess to draft a new, wider convention to give it some power ofenforcement. The meeting in Paris is meant to give a political pushto the negotiations.   Perez de Cuellar told the delegates, ``The time has come to takeconcerted political action at a high level.''   Mitterrand said the conference should also examine the questionof how to control and verify any future chemical weapons accord.   The conference was formally proposed by President Reagan.Mitterrand had said earlier he was looking for such an initiative.   French officials stress that the final communique, to be issuedWednesday, is political in nature, and that binding agreements mustcome from Geneva, where delegates from 40 nations are at work.   According to U.S. estimates, about 20 nations have or are capableof producing chemical arms.</TEXT></DOC>
