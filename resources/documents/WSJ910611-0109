So much for the image.</LP><TEXT>   According to a survey conducted by Wiesenberger InvestmentCompanies Service, most fund managers don't regularly work onweekends, and they spend only 21 days a year visitingcompanies. Compensation, modest by Wall Street standards, istypically less than $250,000 a year.   Wiesenberger, a New York mutual fund research company,sent its questionnaire to almost 1,000 stock fund managersthat the company tracks. The survey results, whichWiesenberger plans to sell for $5,000 a copy, were based onresponses from 220 managers.   Of these 220 managers, 46 were classified as highperformers based on their fund's five-year and 10-yearresults. Fifty-two were classified as poor performers.   Want to invest with a top stock fund manager? TheWiesenberger survey provides a few clues. It seems topmanagers are more likely than average to be bottomup stockpickers who avoid grand predictions about the stock marketand the economy, and instead spend their days researchingindividual companies.   Indeed, top managers said they spend almost 28 days a yearvisiting companies, much more than the average manager. Topmanagers also claimed they work harder, clocking an average56 hours a week, compared with 51 hours a week forpoor-performing fund managers and 53.6 hours for the averagefund manager.   Among top fund managers, 29% said they try to stay fullyinvested in the stock market at all times, and just 7% saidthey regularly adjust their fund's cash positions dependingon stock market conditions. By contrast, only 19% of thepoor-performers said they stayed fully invested, while 27% ofthis group regularly adjust their cash position.   Mom and Dad also deserve some credit, says theWiesenberger survey. Among top fund managers, 26% said theylearnt a lot about investing from their parents, comparedwith just 10% for the poorer-performers.   In one respect, top fund managers aren't such astuteinvestors. The survey found that 23% of top managers didn'town shares of the fund they manage, compared with 19% for allmanagers.   Fund managers -- both good and bad -- rely heavily onpublished financial data and chats with company management.More than half of the fund managers surveyed said thatdocuments, such as annual reports and filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, are essential in makinginvestment decisions, and 64% said that talking to acompany's management is essential or often helpful.   &quot;It's fashionable to say that published financial data isgarbage,&quot; notes Jonathan Pond, an editor of WiesenbergerMutual Funds Investment Report, a monthly newsletter. &quot;But itcomes out that {fund managers} rely very heavily on financialdata. Fund managers also tend to say that you can't trustmanagement. But it comes across in the survey that they spenda lot of time talking to management.&quot;   Only 87 fund managers answered the question about 1989compensation. Of this group, 20% said they earned more than$250,000, while almost half pegged their earnings at between$100,000 and $250,000. Eight fund managers said they madeless than $50,000, and just one manager confessed to earningmore than $1 million.   Richard Lannamann, a managing director of Russell ReynoldsAssociates, an executive search company, isn't surprised bythe salary levels. &quot;There are a lot of $50 million and $30million funds that are run by pretty junior people,&quot; notesMr. Lannamann. &quot;Mutual fund managers generally make less thanthe better quality pension fund managers.&quot;   Fund managers are a brainy bunch; 62% have MBAs, and 86%said that during their school career they were consistentlyin the top half of their class. But another 14% said theiracademic performance was erratic or abysmal, and 7% didn'tgraduate from university.   Want to find out more about your fund manager? Don'tbother calling. The survey found that 57% of managers rarelyor never speak to individual fund shareholders.</TEXT></DOC>
