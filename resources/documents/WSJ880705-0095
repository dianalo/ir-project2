The company, a maker of minisupercomputers that are used for scientific and engineering applications, declined to disclose the size of its expected loss or of its charge, which it said resulted from restructuring costs related to its recent purchase of Raster Technologies Inc.    As previously reported, Alliant purchased Raster, a Westford, Mass.-based maker of color-graphics systems for computers, for Alliant common stock valued at about $14.9 million.    In the 1987 second quarter, Alliant earned $1.7 million, or 16 cents a share, including a tax benefit of $580,000. Revenue was $13.4 million.    Alliant said that during the second quarter, its international revenue exceeded expectations but U.S. sales were &quot;well below expectations.&quot; An Alliant spokeswoman said that the lower sales resulted mainly from &quot;confusion&quot; in its market, because of new competitors entering it with new products and because of the freeze on U.S. defense spending. She added that Alliant's market is expected to be &quot;competitive&quot; for the rest of 1988.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Alliant shares closed at $5.75, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
