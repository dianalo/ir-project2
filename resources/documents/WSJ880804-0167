The talks have been repeatedly adjourned and resumed since they began four months ago. The main sticking point apparently is disagreement over the level of U.S. &quot;rent&quot; for Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, two of America's biggest military facilities abroad. Manila is demanding that the U.S. raise its payment to $1.2 billion annually for the final two years of an agreement that expires in 1991. The U.S. now pays $180 million a year.    The negotiations concern only those last two years. President Corazon Aquino will then have to decide if the U.S. must close its bases when the pact expires, a decision that could radically change U.S.-Philippine relations and significantly affect the Philippines economy and society. But the current discussions have raised so many hackles that U.S. diplomats say they wouldn't be surprised if the Philippines didn't renew the pact when it expires, forcing the U.S. into a multibillion-dollar relocation.    Of course, the number of parties interested in whether the bases stay open or not goes far beyond the two negotiating governments. The current talks give a chance to identify them.    U.S. Taxpayers: The cost to the U.S. will rise sharply if Washington ends up paying more rent for the bases, or if it has to relocate them. Clark is home to the only major U.S. tactical Air Force installation in Southeast Asia and is the air logistics hub for all U.S. forces in the Western Pacific with major aircraft-maintenance facilities and huge stockpiles of fuel, ammunition and other military supplies. Subic has facilities to supply and repair several Navy carrier battle groups and supports operations in the Indian and western Pacific oceans.    Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Singapore and other locations could take some of the bases' functions, but at great cost. In 1977 it was estimated that transplanting the bases would cost $2 billion. By 1986 the figure was up to $8 billion. And once the runways and piers are built, there are the higher wages that workers elsewhere command. In 1977 ship-repair work at Subic cost $21.50 per worker per 12-hour shift. In Guam it would have been $142. Since then the Philippine peso has fallen, reducing dollar-based costs here even more.    Filipino Labor: The flip side of savings in the Philippines for U.S taxpayers is low wages for Filipinos. Some 10,000 of them are direct employees of the U.S government at Subic and Clark. Tens of thousands more are contract laborers.    Bert Concepcion lives just across the canal that separates the Subic naval base from the squalor that is its host city of Olongapo. His house is a small wooden box with flour-sack curtains and faulty electricity, just beyond the city dump.    &quot;I've been working on the base for 19 years, and look at the way I live, &quot; says Mr. Concepcion, a production planner at the ship-repair yard. He says a manual laborer on the base makes $1 an hour. At his own desk job, he makes about $2 an hour, plus a rice subsidy and an annual bonus.    As low as the wages are, conventional wisdom has it that few Filipino employees would find jobs that pay as well should the bases close. Mr. Concepcion is no longer so sure. This year, he served on a union negotiations team that studied wages at 36 companies in Manila. He came away with the impression the U.S. Navy is a scrooge.    The Philippine Left: Exploitation itself can be exploited. Filipino activists are shooting fish in a barrel when it comes to Subic and Clark. Low wages, venereal-disease epidemics, illegitimate children are all part of the landscape around the bases. Activists can claim the bases make the Philippines a target in a nuclear war.    Few used to listen. Now more do.    &quot;In the past it was all grovel and snivel,&quot; says the Rev. Shay Cullen, who has spent 20 years ministering to Olongapo's street children, hookers and drug addicts. &quot;It was so sad. Now, they are thirsty for more information.&quot;    A strengthened national consciousness is probably a healthy thing for the Philippines, where generations of Spanish and U.S. control, followed by years of dictatorial rule under Ferdinand Marcos, have left society lacking self-confidence. The bases provide a highly visible whipping boy for social critics and nationalists.    Businessmen: &quot;A strong U.S. is good for the interests of the Philippines,&quot; says Richard Gordon, the young mayor of Olongapo, and a local hotel and restaurant baron.    Indeed, the U.S. maintains that the bases pump many millions of dollars into the Philippine economy, over and above whatever compensation and aid the U.S. gives to Manila. Much of it arrives in Olongapo as purchases of T-shirts and meals, booze and prostitutes by U.S. sailors.    If the bases left, entertainment empires such as Mr. Gordon's would collapse. And there is little to take their place. Olongapo is said to have only one factory, a small wicker-furniture plant run by Father Cullen and staffed by destitutes.    The Soviets: Since Mrs. Aquino took power in February 1986, eager Russians have been arriving in the Philippines. A deputy foreign minister came in March. The vice president of the Supreme Soviet came in April. Philippine congressman recently traveled to Moscow to pave the way for an Aquino trip next June.    The Soviet Union, which now mans abandoned U.S. bases in Vietnam, only 800 miles from Clark and Subic, is on a &quot;peace offensive&quot; in the Philippines. Moscow has promised &quot;to do many things&quot; for the Philippines if the U.S. were to leave, but aside from proposals for scientific and cultural exchanges and help on a nickel refinery and power plants, it hasn't been specific.    Some Philippine politicians want to take advantage of the offers. &quot;Sanctimonious anticommunist ideology has left the country wallowing in poverty,&quot; says Leticia Shahani, chairwoman of the Philippine Senate Foreign Relations Committee.    Yet for all their new nationalism, many in the Philippines don't take kindly to the Soviets. The Filipinos have a troublesome communist insurgency that they suspect Moscow is helping. Last year, Manila residents marched in the streets to protest a new Soviet Embassy building, saying it would be a den of spies.    Other Asian Nations: Japan is often criticized for taking a free ride under the U.S. defense umbrella. The U.S. protects the sea lanes of Asia, the argument goes, while Japan pulls ahead in world trade and economic influence, unencumbered by costly military programs.    That has prompted calls for Japan to take on more of the region's defense -- a prospect that frightens Asian nations that felt the effects of Japanese militarism in World War II.    Even Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who has had differences with the U.S., told a symposium in November that &quot;the underlying basis for growth since World War II, especially in Asia, has been the stability and security provided by the United States.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
