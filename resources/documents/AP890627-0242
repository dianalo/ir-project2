In the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre and subsequentstring of executions, experts point to pockets of vulnerabilityamong U.S. companies working with China as well as a decline inChinese imports.   ``It won't be because Americans don't want to buy, but deliveryand reliability will be perceived widely as going down, and thatwill affect orders irrespective of whether it's true,'' said DavidM. Lampton, president of the National Committee on UnitedStates-China Relations.   China had replaced other Pacific Rim nations as a low-costproducer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents whilesteadily improving productivity and quality as workers became moremotivated.   ``The problem is going to be whether the work force will continueto be as productive,'' Lampton said, as Chinese workers and managersbecome more fearful of associating with foreigners.   ``Communications are snarled, we don't know if longshoremen willload ships on time,'' and American importers just may not want todeal with those uncertainties, he noted.   Without Chinese imports, Americans would pay more for Nikerunning shoes, silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls.   Experts say toy and game importers, who already are stocking upahead of the Christmas shopping season, are scrambling to line upsuppliers in other low-cost nations like Thailand and Mexico. Lastyear China exported $1.17 billion worth of toys and games to theUnited States.   On the flip side, Midwest farmers would take a beating if theirexports were curtailed. Last year they shipped to China about $700million in wheat, the largest U.S. export to the People's Republic,according to the Commerce Department.   Computer makers could lose a $150 million-plus outlet for theirgoods.   Military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of apresidential decree prohibiting further sales to China. GrummanCorp. said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associatedwith a $500 million U.S. Air Force contract to develop and modernizea weapons control system for Chinese fighters.   U.S. companies that sell products like power-generating equipmentto the Chinese goverment could face trouble because China ``is goingto have a foreign exchange shortage,'' said Roger Sullivan,president of the U.S.-China Business Council.   ``They've taken a big hit on their balance of payments. Theycan't buy what they thought they would buy, and they're going tohave to cut imports,'' he said.   Roughly 80 percent of U.S. companies' investment in China lies inindustries that manufacture goods for the domestic market, Sullivansaid. Plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly.   But most U.S. businesses are not likely to suffer substantially.While they have committed $3.4 billion to joint ventures in China,each firm's individual exposure is limited.   General Electric Co., for example, sold $500 million oflocomotives, aircraft engines and medical systems to China over thelast five years, but the number pales in comparison with GE's annualrevenue of $50 billion.   And Ball Corp., a $1.1 billion Muncie, Ind., container maker, hasspent just $2 million since 1987 on its joint container-makingventure in China.   ``From our perspective, it's a very small percentage of sales,''said Ball spokesman Brad Wilks.   Still, companies do not want to mothball their China operations.``It's clearly not because of the money,'' Sullian said. ``It's theeffort. They've spent five or six years building'' a relationship.   For businesses, the attraction is formidable: China looms as thefastest growing economy in the world with a gross national productthat has mushroomed at more than 10 percent a year.   As a market for consumer goods, China is virtually untapped. Thenation's 1.1 billion population is a solid reason ``companies arereluctant to just bag it. You can't just write off 25 perent of theglobe,'' one China watcher said.   While most U.S. companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, afew have found opportunity in the crisis. Jack Shamash, president ofthe New York-based trading company Shamash andamp; Sons Inc., said he hasbeen snapping up Chinese-made products ranging from silks to nails.   Now that Shamash's competitors are skittish about buying, pricesof Chinese-made goods are lower and the goods are more abundant.   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said some American staff of the 175U.S. companies operating out of the Chinese capital are returningdespite a travel advisory and the embassy's counsel against it.   The Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lurebusinessmen back, even as it simultaneously wages a media campaignagainst the U.S. government for alleged interference.   American companies are being bombarded with long-soughtconcessions from the Chinese government and atypical promises ofprompt payment.   Government-owned Noble Tower, a modern Beijing building thathouses foreign companies, sent faxes to every tenant ``asking themto come back and that everything is peaceful,'' said one Americantenant.   But businesses are wary that they may become pawns in China'spowerful propaganda game.   ``We don't want to be in a position where we're manipulated andparaded in front of cameramen,'' said Ball Corp.'s Wilks.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, July 2</NOTE></DOC>
