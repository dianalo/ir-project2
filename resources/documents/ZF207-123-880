 We've collected ahandful of games that pick up on life's adventures to provide hours of adultentertainment.andM;There's Life andamp; Death, a game that lets you assume the role of doctor, albeitin a ghoulish way.andP;  With Final Assault, even the faint of heart can scalesheer, ice-laden mountain ranges.andP;  Leisure Suit Larry is back and on theprowl for a new love.andP;  Airborne Ranger takes you on a hazardous missionbehind enemy lines, and TRACON lets you experience the pressure of being amodern air traffic controller.andM;These are the sorts of games that let us experience the thrill, terror,tension, schmaltz, stress, and ecstasy of our fantasies--all from thetranquil safety of our PCs.andP;  Enjoy.andM;Life andamp; Death: Doesn't Cut ItandM;Scalpe!andP;  Clamp!andP;  Sponge!andP;  Flopply disk!andM;If you've wondered how it feels to shoulder the godlike responsibilities ofthe surgeon, Software Toolworks' new game, Life andamp; Death, promises to give youa taste of the experience--without getting your hands bloody or spending yourlife's savings on malpractice insurance.andP;  But though Life andamp; Death attempts toinclude all the well-known elements of the surgeon's lifestyle--from naggingbeepers to squabbles among the surgical team to sudden disasters on theoperating table--it misses the mark on excitement and authenticity.andM;Life andamp; Death suffers from a serious confusion about its raison d'etre--is itmedical horror software or a fun way to learn some serious medicine?andP;  On thepackage, lurid blurbs trumpet the gruesome possibility that you may kill yourpatient, and there's a realistic photo of a clumsy surgeon dropping abloodied human brain on the operating room floor.andP;  Inside the box, you'llfind a sober, reasonably accurate guide to surgical terms and procedures andan account of the history of surgery, along with a surgical mask and gloves.andM;Unfortunately, the one-person graphical game itself will probably disappointboth budding surgeons and the bloodthirsty.andP;  Play opens at the nurses'station of the hospital, where you're handed your patient assignments.andP;  Whenyou enter a patient's room, you see a brief description of symptoms, and youhave a change to order diagnostic tests and make and examination.andP;  When youmake mistakes, you're sent back to medical school for a few pointers.andM;The slow process of matching the patient's symptoms to those in the game bookcan hardly be called exciting.andP;  Worse, the number of patients is limited, soit takes just a few runs to memorize them all--any suspense there might havebeen evaporates.andP;  The various patient's symptoms are confusingly similar, andthey correspond only partially to the real-life conditions the patients aresupposed to have.andM;Then there's the exam, of the weirdest experiences I've ever had incomputing.andP;  You see a close-up view of the patient's bare abdomen (almost allthe patients are experiencing abdominal pain), the belly button smack in themiddle of the screen.andP;  You &quot;feel&quot; different parts of the torso by clicking onthem with the mouse--when it hurts, you hear a synthesized &quot;yikes&quot; or &quot;yoww.&quot;andO;Otherwise, it's &quot;That feels OK.&quot;andP;  Unbelievably, the patient with gas painshas more tenderness than the one with appendicitis.andM;The climax of the game comes when you find a patient who needs surgery andget him/her onto the table.andP;  You operate by picking up instruments andmedicines with the mouse and moving them over to the patient's exposed belly.andO;Here the pace picks up a bit, since delays can be catastrophic.andP;  You'lldefinitely get a feel for the multitude of concerns surgeons must trackduring an operation--sterility, infection control, anesthesia, surgicaltechnique, and so on.andP;  Still, the point is simply to master a rote sequenceof steps--you do have to deal occasionally with sudden cardiac emergencies,but even these soon become predictable.andM;After a few stabs (ahem) at it, and several trips to the morgue, you shouldsave your first patient.andP;  But you may know just enough to be dangerous toyour family and friends.andP;  Steve CummingsandM;Final Assault: No Cliff-HangerandM;Somewhere in my misbegotten youth, there was a time when I defined excitementwith a rope, a rucksack, and 200 feet of near-vertical cliff to climb.andM;Fortunately, I recognized my own moratality before the inevitable nasty fall,and I put away the pitons and rope for good.andP;  But memories of thoseadventures linger, so it was with some anticipation that I began playingFinal Assault, a new game from Epyx.andM;Final Assault gives you the opportunity to attempt some armchair alpineclimbing.andP;  You traverse crevasses, scale rock walls, and claw your way up icefields.andP;  The graphics are good, and pre-climb preparations run true to life,with some humorous twists.andM;Unfortunately, that's where the excitement ends.andP;  Final Assault is neitheractive enough to qualify as an arcade game nor complex enough to be called anadventure game.andM;Climbing the routes in Final Assault consists primarily of reptitivekeystrokes or joystick movements as you wend your way up the mountain.andO;Occasionally a rock will fall and whack you on the head, a hidden crevassewill open up beneath your feet, or your ice axe will slip from its hold.andP;  Ifyou happen to be wearing the right safety equipment at the time of theseunfortunate events, you're OK.andP;  If not, you're dead.andM;Unfortunately, Epyx has neglected, even with the design advice of climberEric Escoffier, the rich strategy and tactical decisions an alpine ascentrequires.andP;  Will the weather hold?andP;  Do those clouds presage a nasty storm?andO;Does this snowfield look avalanche-prone? Do we have the energy to take thefinal pitch now, or should we wait until morning?andM;But in Final Assault, all you get is a cute little icon telling you that youare getting hungry, tired, or cold.andP;  So you pull a candy bar, sleepin bag, orjacket from your pack, and everything is once again copacetic.andM;That's not the way I remember it.andP;  Of course, no computer game could possiblysimulate the cascading moments of terror and joy that a real alpine ascentengenders.andP;  But whether you have climbed a mountain before or not, you'relikely to find Final Assault a mixed bag: enjoyable for its graphics butdisappointing for its slow, uncomplicated play.andP;  Avery JenkinsandM;Leisure Suit Larry:andM;Dressed to SpillandM;Lock the doors.andP;  Hide the women.andP;  Leisure Suit Larry is back and he's givingnotice: he wants a serious relationship.andM;Larry's the kind of man whose idea of fashion is a wash-and-wear toupee.andO;He's been turned down more times than a transistor radio.andP;  His little blackbook needs a reader service card.andP;  So what's Larry doing on a luxury cruisecarrying a million dollars in cash and secret KGB microfilm?andM;Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places) is thesequel to Leisures Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, SierraOn-Line's hilarious animated mockery of the singles scene.andM;Tired, apparently, of his endless come-ons and trite lines, Larry's hottubhoney has set him free to wander the streets of Los Angeles with nothing buta dollar in his pocket.andP;  His luck soon changes for the better, however, andhe finds himself the winner of a million dollars and a luxury cruise with thepouting Barbara Bimbo, who mistakes him for someone with charm andpersonality.andP;  Just as Larry is about to sail off for a month of sun, surf,and sex, he suddenly becomes an unwitting participant in a KGB espionagecaper.andP;  That won't really surprise people who know Larry; he's been anunwitting participant all his life.andM;Definitely for adults only, Looking for Love is a mastery of computeranimation and hilarious one-liners.andP;  In the role of Larry, the user movesthrough a 3-D interactive story, desperately trying to outwit an abundance offoes and withstand a constant barrage of putdowns.andP;  A running commentaryattacks everything from the way Larry looks, dresses, and smells to trendy,overpriced boutiques, low riders, and the intelligence of Californians.andP;  Asyou guide Larry through the various screens, you must gather some unusualitems (a 32-gallon cup of soda, for example) while the computer monitors yourprogress with a running point total and a ranking that ranges from &quot;nerd&quot; and&quot;dim bulb&quot; to &quot;lowlife&quot; and &quot;minion.&quot;andM;If you're familiar with Larry's antics, you'll notice a number ofimprovements when you play Looking for Love.andP;  The game is easier to play, andSierra has added a running musical score for those fortunate enough to ownPCs equipped with music cards from IBM, Ad Lib, or Roland.andP;  Looking for Loveisn't copy protected, but you do need a phone number from the manual eachtime you start the game.andM;If you've got an open mind, a fast PC, and a few hours to spend, you'll lovethe latest adventures of Leisure Suit Larry.andM;Airborne Ranger:andM;Behind Enemy LinesandM;I admit it.andP;  Using the light antitank weapon (LAW) was probably overkill.andO;But I was out of ammo for my M-16, I couldn't remember which button armed myranger with a knife, and I had already thrown all my grenades.andP;  It's likethat sometimes when you're all by yourself completing a dangerous missionbehind enemy lines.andP;  It also happens to be a great deal of fun.andM;This is Airborne Ranger, a combat simulation game from MicroProse, a companybest known for its realistic military weapon simulations (including Gunshipand F-15 Strike Eagle).andP;  Airborne Ranger is an engaging, fast action gamethat manages to achieve a balance that many games do not.andP;  While it is easyto understand the basic play of the game, there is enough depth and challengeto Airborne Ranger that it won't bore you after an hour, as many arcade-typegames do.andM;The premise of Airborne Ranger is simple.andP;  You are part of an elite fightingsquad about to undertake a solo mission--blowing up a munitions depot, say,or freeing hostages.andP;  To add to the challenge and variety, you can choose oneof three climatic zones (temperate, arctic, or desert), and you can vary thedifficulty level as your skills increase.andM;After choosing your mission, you outfit your supply pods with an assortmentof weapons, and you're ready for the airdrop.andP;  As your plane flies over enemyterritory, your drop the three supply pods wherever you like, and thenparachute out yourself at the given signal.andP;  If all goes well (and it usuallydidn't for me), you'll complete your mission successfully in the timeallotted and meet your plane for a pickup at the designated rendezvous spot.andM;If things don't go that well, you'll either get killed or you'll run out oftime and find yourself stranded behind enemy lines.andP;  Either way, you'llprobably have a lot of fun doing it.andM;You can control the ranger's movements and the firing of weapons using thekeyboard or a joystick, though I much preferred the latter.andP;  Function keyschange your current weapon, control whether you run or walk, and switchbetween the overall map and the ranger's-eye views.andM;This isn't just a blow-'em-up arcade game.andP;  Strategy definitely counts, andthe excellent (and mercifully slim) manual is full of helpful tactical hints,such as how and when to best use your LAW rockets in a particular mission.andO;The MCGA and EGA graphics are first-rate, and Airborne Ranger provides trulyabsorbing game play.andP;  You can play without investing hours reading the manualand trying to remember what controls what.andM;You can spend a lot of time on this one and still find it fresh andinvolving.andP;  And, in case you're wondering, there is no real gore.andP;  You canwork off your frustrations, knock off a bunch of enemies, or dieyourself--and it's all in good fun.andM;TRACON ATC Simulator:andM;More Than Just a Game--AandM;Nervous HeadacheandM;A dozen planes are converging over the skies of Los Angeles.andP;  Still more siton runways awaiting the command for takeoff.andP;  Thousands of lives hang in thebalance, and it's your job to make sure nothing goes wrong.andM;Wesson International's new product, TRACON, lets the average PC user enterthe complex and hectic world of air traffic control (ATC).andM;Created with air traffic control and Federal Aviation Authority experts,TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach CONtrol) is complicated, challenging,demanding, realistic, and often frustrating.andP;  The manual accurately refers toTRACON as a simulator rather than as a game.andP;  It's not the type of programyou could actually call fun.andP;  Spend just a few minutes with TRACON, andyou'll begin to see how stressful the job of an air traffic controller mustbe.andP;  Becoming truly proficient at TRACON will probably take many hours.andM;Start the demo simulation and the air traffic controller's nerve-rattlingresponsibilities begin to become apparent.andP;  The controller must juggle activeand pending flightstrips and accept and &quot;hand off&quot; aircraft to and from otherair traffic control facilities.andP;  He must coordinate headings, altitudes,airspeeds, takeoffs, and approaches for all aircraft on the radar scopewithin a given sector.andP;  Commands are executed either on the keypad or with amouse, and all tasks must be accomplished by using realistic air trafficecontrol procedures, control terminology, and jargon.andP;  To help you along asyou learn the game, TRACON includes a &quot;quick reference&quot; keypad-command guide.andM;The instruction manual, though clearly written, is technical and extensive(six chapters, plus appendixes and a glossary).andP;  Those users who &quot;don't domanuals&quot; shouldn't expect to get far in TRACON.andM;The program also comes with an audiocassette tape that you sync to one of thedemonstration scenarios.andP;  The tape contains an audio dramatization that letsthe user hear the dialogue between air traffic control personnel and pilotsas events occur on the screen.andP;  If you've read the manual, you may be able tofollow the action reasonably well.andP;  But while the tape is interesting, it ishardly instructional, and when your first real simulation begins, there areno voices to help you along.andP;  All communication takes place in a dialog boxat the bottom of the screen, and you may feel completely alone.andM;Choose a control sector: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, orBoston.andP;  The color graphics are excellent, especially on an EGA or VGAsystem.andP;  And the better the machine, the faster TRACON performs.andP;  A sweepingradar beam continuously scans the skies, pinpointing each aircraft andreporting its altitude with every scan.andP;  Airports, airways, radio beacons,intersection fixes, and ILSs (instrument landing systems) are all depictedfaithfully from actual government airspace charts.andP;  TRACON also showssignificant ground markings such as coastlines.andM;Set the traffic load by choosing the number of aircraft for each simulation.andO;You can control up to 99 aircraft in 99 minutes.andP;  You can choose the weatherconditions and select the skill levels of the pilots (perfect, average, orlousy).andP;  For those who like to keep score, each scenario has a possible pointtotal, and TRACON will store the highest score for each user.andP;  You gainpoints for such things as fuel efficiency and lose them for near-misses andother mistakes.andP;  Ultimately, your goal, as the manual puts it, is to &quot;keep'em apart but keep 'em on course and on time.&quot;andP;  If a midair collision doesoccur, you will receive a harsh letter of termination and be promptly dumpedback into DOS.andM;Your 12-year-old isn't going to be able to get the hang of this one in anafternoon, and neither are you.andP;  TRACON is at least as complicated as manyflight simulators, yet it doesn't offer the same exciting visual action oremotional gratification.andP;  But, to be fair, it's not really trying to.andM;TRACON seems as if it were designed as a training tool for air trafficcontrollers and not for run-of-the-mill PC game players.andP;  Could the decisionto market it to the public have been an afterthought?andM;If you have an interest in aviation and air traffic control and the time toput into TRACON, the manual will eventually get you going.andP;  The hardest partseems to be learning the terminology well enough to put together the propercommands.andP;  Budding pilots may have an edge on the rest of us.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
