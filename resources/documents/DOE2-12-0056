First, in the previoussketch extraction procedure, vertical-location-invariant thresholdingand shape-oriented smoothing are newly developed to improve the precisionof lung borders and rib images in each sketch, respectively. Then, twonew ways for image retrieval using sketches; (1) image-description retrievaland (2) pattern-matching retrieval, are proposed. In each retrieval way,a procedure for understanding picture queries input through a sketchis described in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
