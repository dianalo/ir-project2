The Fed's increase in the discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5percent was the first such rise since Aug. 9, and coincided withmoves by New York banks to hike their prime lending rate to 11.5percent from 11 percent.   The steps jolted Wall Street today and sent stock and bond pricesdown sharply. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 28points to the 2,261 level by late morning. The 30-year Treasury bondfell nearly $7.50 per $1,000 in face amount.   The discount rate is the Fed's loan fee to member financialinstitutions and historically has influenced other interest ratesnationwide. The increase today put the discount rate at its highestpoint in three years.   The prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business andconsumer loan rates, including car loans and adjustable-rate homemortgages. An increase in the prime means borrowers will have to paymore to finance their debts.   The half-percentage point increase in the prime was firstannounced late Thursday by Chase Manhattan bank and quickly followedby rivals. It was the second increase in two weeks and lifted therate to 11.5 percent, the highest level since November 1984.   The prime hike reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banksface themselves, indicating the Fed is soaking up money in thebanking system, one of its weapons in restraining inflation.   The interest rate increases came against a background of signsthat inflation is intensifying, a partial result of low unemploymentand strong economic growth. On Wednesday, the Labor Department saidconsumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent,the highest level in two years.   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called the inflation trend disturbingand vowed to pressure rates up until he squeezes inflation out ofthe economy.</TEXT></DOC>
