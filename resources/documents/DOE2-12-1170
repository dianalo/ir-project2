Since theoretical calculationsdepend upon approximations of the power system components, a method toevaluate these calculations with emperical data is needed. This paperdiscusses a test method to determine the impedance of an ac system. Inaddition to discussing this method, fault calculations and impedancemeasurements obtained from field testing are compared with a theoreticalanalysis.</TEXT></DOC>
