In a deal that has sparked widespread debate in the U.S.and concern in Taiwan, McDonnell Douglas made a preliminaryagreement late last year to sell as much as a 40% interest inits commercial aircraft manufacturing operations to TaiwanAerospace for about $2 billion. In return, Douglas Aircraft,a division with operations in Long Beach, Calif., wouldproduce wing and fuselage sections in Taiwan for a new,three-engine jumbo jetliner.</LP><TEXT>   Under terms of the memorandum of understanding, McDonnellDouglas could sell an additional 9% to other Asian orEuropean investors if Taiwan took the full 40% investment,leaving majority control in the hands of the St. Louis-basedconcern.   Last week, officials of government-backed Taiwan Aerospacesaid that while their review of the deal is continuing, theymight buy as little as 25% of the Douglas operation if theydecide to go forward with the investment.   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the company always hascharacterized the 40% potential Taiwan stake as a maximuminvestment, and has said that the company expects otherpossible investments from interests in Japan, Korea,Indonesia and Singapore. The spokesman also said that even ifTaiwan Aerospace buys 40%, &quot;they might sell some of it.&quot;   The spokesman said media reports suggest that the firstpart of the Taiwan Aerospace review of the proposal iscomplete, and that the Taiwanese are proceeding with a secondand final phase.   In addition to political concerns being raised in Taipeiabout the wisdom of a large commitment to the McDonnellDouglas airliner development, Boeing Co. and U.S. legislatorsraised concerns about the transaction in congressionalhearings last week. The arrangement was criticized for, amongother things, locating large numbers of jobs overseas,transferring important technology outside the U.S. andpresenting the potential for government subsidization thatwould resemble the subsidies provided for the AirbusIndustrie consortium in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
