SesitStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPANBOND MARKET NEWS (BON)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   New Japanese investment in the U.S. will slow from last year's record pace but will remain significant, analysts say. Japanese investors also are expected to accelerate the diversification of their U.S. holdings away from bonds and into equities and real estate.    The major factors behind the expected shifts are the weak U.S. dollar and relatively low U.S. interest rates.    Salomon Brothers Inc. projects that private Japanese investors will purchase the equivalent of about $115 billion of foreign assets in 1987, down from a record $132.4 billion last year. Much of these funds are either invested in the U.S. or in Eurodollar bonds. The New York-based investment firm estimates that 85% to 90% of Japanese purchases of foreign stock and 70% of the fixed-income securities purchases have been dollar-denominated, including U.S. government, agency and corporate debt and Eurodollar securities.    A slowdown in new Japanese investment in the U.S. could have far-reaching implications. Foreign purchases of U.S. government and other dollar-denominated investments have helped fund the U.S. budget deficit, keep U.S. interest rates low and prevent the dollar from crashing. And the Japanese have played a leading role.    Japan's long-term foreign assets at the end of last year totaled nearly $397 billion -- higher than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' peak holdings of $380 billion in 1983. Japanese trading in U.S. Treasury securities climbed fivefold in the past 17 months and now accounts for as much as 15% of daily turnover, according to Michael R. Rosenberg, a vice president at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;They are an important force in our market and are going to remain such,&quot; he adds.    Motoi Okada, an executive vice president at the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co., says: &quot;Japanese investment (alone) can't push up the U.S. market, but emotionally it can push it up.&quot;    It also can push U.S. markets down. A major fear in the markets and among international monetary officials is that a steep, swift dollar decline could scare away foreign capital, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which could push the U.S. economy, and those of other nations, into a recession.    That scenario would be less likely if senior officials of major industrial nations, scheduled to meet this weekend, are able to hammer out an accord that succeeds in stabilizing the dollar. &quot;If the dollar is stabilized, more (Japanese) money would come to the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Okada says.    But regardless of the results of the weekend meeting, no one is predicting a wholesale dumping of dollar assets by foreign investors. &quot;It's not going to be a case of today we do it, tomorrow we don't,&quot; says Mr. Rosenberg. Japanese investment in the U.S. &quot;isn't going to dry up; they have too much commitment here,&quot; he says.    Japanese investors have found numerous reasons for investing abroad, particularly in the U.S. With one of the highest savings rates in the world and a huge current account surplus, the Japanese have plenty of money to invest. The recent relaxation of restrictions on investments abroad has freed Japanese investors to pursue the higher yields available outside their country. And a growing network of branches of Japanese financial institutions around the world has played a major role in funneling Japanese investment overseas.    Much of that money has flowed to the U.S., especially into government bonds, because of relatively high yields and low risk. As an added incentive, the yen's steep rise against the dollar in the past two years makes many U.S. investments look cheap to Japanese investors, so long as any currency loss is balanced by capital gains and yield. It is that caveat that lies behind the expected shifts of Japanese funds.    &quot;There has been an increasing reluctance to buy U.S. bonds because yields have come down from levels Japanese investors feel comfortable with,&quot; says Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc.    In the past year, the difference between yields on U.S. and Japanese 10-year government bonds has fallen below three percentage points, the spread that institutional investors normally consider wide enough to protect them from potential currency losses. That margin is currently 2.3 percentage points and was only 1.7 points a few weeks ago.    As a result, Salomon Brothers expects Japanese net private investment in foreign bonds to grow only $66 billion this year, compared with the $93 billion expansion of 1986. That would mean the Japanese would buy about $20 billion fewer dollar-denominated bonds than they did last year.    But the investment firm also predicts that Japanese investor appetite for foreign equities will more than double this year, to $16 billion, or even triple, while new direct investment is expected to grow by $20 billion, about 50% more than last year's expansion.    Mr. Okada of Daiwa says that the strong yen, extremely high price/earnings ratios on Japanese equities and a slowing Japanese economy make U.S. stocks look cheap to Japanese investors.    Japanese institutions also are buying more securities denominated in West German marks, Canadian dollars and British pounds, to hedge against further dollar declines. Net purchases of Canadian-dollar bonds nearly tripled to $5 billion in 1986, and were running at a $10 billion annual clip in the fourth quarter.    The Japanese have also stepped up their purchases of Euroyen bonds, which are now yielding more than their domestic equivalents.    In addition, Mr. Pardee of Yamaichi noted that the Japanese even hedge currency risk when buying foreign stocks, by concentrating on U.S. companies that benefit from a weak dollar.    There is another factor, in addition to a weak dollar and relatively low U.S. interest rates, that could discourage Japanese investment in the U.S. Economists say Japan's banks have funded as much as $55 billion of dollar-denominated bond purchases with short-term dollar debt. Analayts warn that those holdings could be dumped if U.S. interest rates begin to rise or short-term rates become higher than long-term ones.    ---        Private Japanese Appetite For Foreign Assets    Net foreign purchases    (In billions of dollars)                                  1986     1986     1987* Direct investments               $6.4    $14.5     $20.0 Equities                          1.0      7.0      16.0 Foreign bonds                    53.5     93.0      66.0 Other                            20.8     17.9      13.0 Total                           $81.7   $132.4    $115.0 *Estimate Source: Ministry of Finance; Salamon Brothers Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
