Dr. Steven Ringer, head of the hospital's neonatal intensivecare unit, said the infant died of respiratory failure from hispremature and traumatic birth.   The baby had been in intensive care since his delivery byemergency Caesarean section shortly after his mother, Carol Stuart,was shot Oct. 23.   Charles Stuart, 29, who was critically wounded in the attack,was brought by ambulance from Boston City Hospital to be at hisson's bedside along with family members.   Mrs. Stuart, 30, who was seven months pregnant, was shot andkilled by a gunman who held up the couple in their car after theyleft Brigham and Women's Hospital.   ``Everybody in the city of Boston was really praying beyond hopethat Christopher would make it,'' Flynn said.   But family members said the baby, who was delivered two monthsprematurely, may have suffered serious brain damage. He weighed 3pounds, 13 ounces at birth and had neither grown nor gained weight.   The infant had been on a life-support system and sufferedrepeated convulsions since birth, family members said.   The assailant in the case is still at large.</TEXT></DOC>
