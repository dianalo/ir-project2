Green, Associate GeneralCounsel, Office of General Counsel_(202) 632-5087.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>At 54 FR 3457 dated January 24, 1989,the Office of Personnel Management published a notice of proposed rulemaking.Pursuant to the direction of the United States Court of Appeals for theDC Circuit (<T3>NTEU </T3>v. <T3>Horner, </T3>Nos. 87-5102 andamp; 87-5191) and the United States Courtfor the District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 84-2573), OPM supplementedthe rulemaking record which had been developed in 1982 for the purposeof receiving comments. The original final rule had been published on August31, 1982 (47 FR 38257). The purpose of supplementing the rulemaking recordwas to permit OPM to explain further the cost data upon which it reliedin 1982 when it authorized agencies to use a Schedule B authority to appointeligible applicants to positions in the Professional and AdministrativeCareer (PAC) occupations at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels where agencies wereunable to fill vacancies through internal recruitment. Pursuant to the terms of a consent decree which was entered by the U.S.District Court for the District of Columbia (<T3>Luevano </T3>v. <T3>Devine, </T3>Civil Action No. 79-271), OPM, in 1982, eliminated theProfessional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE) which was formerlyused to examine applicants for the PAC occupations. By 1982, the existingPACE registers had become or would shortly have become inadequate for staffingneeds. OPM permitted agencies to use a Schedule B appointing authorityto fill vacancies in PAC occupations until it could replace that authoritywith job-specific, competitive examinations for the approximately 118 PACoccupations. Since 1986, by Executive Order 12596, PAC employees hiredunder the Schedule B appointment authority have been converted non-competitivelyinto the competitive service at the GS-9 level where the employing agencyhad determined that the employee's qualifications and performance warrantedsuch conversion. Two comments were received on OPM's publication regarding the use of ScheduleB based on certain cost considerations, one from a private citizen andone from a labor union which represents Federal employees in some agencies.Both expressed their concern that the use of Schedule B as an appointingauthority in the excepted service would undermine basic merit principles.Appointments under Schedule B are made subject to the same basic qualificationrequirements as appointments in the competitive service, requiring thatselections be made soley on the basis of merit and fitness. As such, useof Schedule B is subject to the same statutory requirements at 5 U.S.C.2301 and 2302 governing merit system principles and prohibited personnelpractices.Each agency determines when and in what manner to advertise individualPAC vacancies based on current staffing needs. Procedures in evaluatingindividual applications under Schedule B may take the form of a straightnumerical ranking of candidates based on a rating of each applicant's educationand experience similar to the traditional unassembled testing methods usedin competitive examinations. Agencies may group and rank applicants intoadjective categories such as ``qualified'' or ``highly qualified'' or intoscore ranges such as ``90-100,'' ``80-89,'' or ``70-79.'' Additionally, agencies are required to consider veterans preference. UnderSchedule B appointments, veterans have always been listed first in theirrespective category. Disabled veterans precede all others regardless ofnumerical rating. Thus, some veterans may experience a greater advantage,in some instances, because they are placed first in their category as opposedto being merely first in terms of their numerical score. The rationale for the published rule involved only cost considerationsas required by the Courts' orders. However, the union has raised severalother concerns that did not involve cost considerations but to which OPM'sresponse is nevertheless warranted. The union expressed the concern thatagencies should use only internal procedures until competitive examinationsare developed rather than continue to use Schedule B. From its inception,OPM has emphasized that agencies may use Schedule B a an appointing authorityto fill vacancies through external sources where they have been unableto fill such vacancies through other means such as reassignment, transfer,reinstatement or promotion (FPM Letter 213-32 (4), paragraph 6 (September9, 1982) and 47 FR 28257 (August 31, 1982)). Indeed, internal appointmentshave always been the primary method of filling PAC positions at the GS-5and GS-7 levels, regardless of whether external appointments were throughPACE, alternative competitive examining, or through Schedule B. Agency success in complying with the instruction to use Schedule B a atlast resort is reflected in the small proportion of external hiring whichhas actually occurred under the Schedule B PAC authority. In the calendaryears between 1983 and 1986, external PAC hires at the GS-5 and GS-7 levelsunder Schedule B ranged from between 14 to 20 percent of all hires in thePAC occupations. In 1987, only 10 percent of all such hires were from externalsources. In the first six months of 1988, less than 8 percent of all PAChires at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels were from external sources. Thus, todayover 90 percent of all hiring in the PAC occupations at those levels isthrough the kind of competitive examination and appointment process whichthe union suggests is appropriate or through internal procedures such asreinstatement, transfer, reassignment or promotion, not through ScheduleB appointment. External PAC hires, whether through Schedule B or through competitive examiningprocedures, represent a very small portion of OPM's overall examining responsibility.For example, in calendar year 1987, in PAC occupations for which competitiveexaminations had not yet been developed, external PAC hires under ScheduleB at the GS-5 and GS-7 levels represented only sixty-eight hundredths ofone percent of total new hires in all occupations under all appointingauthorities in the Executive Branch agencies, excluding postal employees.OPM's resources for developing and revising examinations for external recruitmentin the PAC occupations must be viewed in comparison to its total examiningresponsibilities in all occupations. The union also raises certain concerns regarding OPM's obligations underthe <T3>Luevano </T3>consent decree, concerns which are based on the union'spossible misunderstanding of that decree. To the extent that the union'scomments relate to OPM's decision to terminate the use of the PACE andto permit agencies to use Schedule B until competitive examinations couldbe developed    cost-effectively, OPM now takes this opportunity to respondto and to correct any misunderstandings of that decree. The union suggests that OPM entered into the consent decree and then shortlythereafter abandoned its agreement to replace the PACE with competitiveexaminations. When the Court preliminarily approved the decree in late1980, OPM believed that it would have the budgetary and personnel resourcesto replace the PACE with job-specific examinations in all PAC occupationsin accordance with the decree's timetable. However, due to subsequent,government-wide reductions in Federal hiring and actual reductions in OPM'sown budgetary and personnel allocations, events which began to occur afterthe preliminary approval of the decree and subsequent to final approvalin February 1982, OPM believed it had to concentrate its limited resourcesinitially on developing examinations in those occupations which traditionallyhad the largest number of vacancies. The extensive discussion of cost dataand personnel and budget reductions is set forth in the proposed rule at54 FR 3457-3458 (January 24, 1989) which is referenced herein. The union states that the decree allowed a phased replacement of the PACEand that OPM's budget should have been adequate to develop alternativetests during the three-year, phase-in period. OPM has already explainedthat development of many job-specific tests was considered to be too expensivein view of OPM's budgetary constraints and the anticipated reductions inhiring. Indeed, the vast majority of occupations subject to Schedule Bhad fewer than 20 external hires on average from 1983 to the present. Inaddition, while the decree allowed for a three-year, phase-out period ofPACE, a minimum of 50 percent of the appointments in all PAC jobs had tobe by alternative examinations after one year, 80 percent after two years,and 100 percent at the end of three years. That schedule did not lend itselfto the gradual development of scores of new tests which the union commentsseem to suggest.The union also states that OPM's cost figures are misleading because thefigures are based on developing separate tests for each covered occupation.The union offers its view that the decree allows OPM to group similar jobsunder a single test and that, by doing so, OPM could, or should, have beenable to reduce its costs. Under the decree, OPM was permitted to developa single examination to cover more than one PAC occupation only where theoccupations are similar <T3>and </T3>where there are relatively few vacancies to fill in thoseoccupations. Not all such small-fill occupations can be covered by a singleexamination, however, because some lack the requisite homogeneity and,thus, are unsuitable for grouping. Even if grouping is acceptable in somecases, development of the remaining job-specific, competitive examinationsis still enormously expensive.The union also suggests that OPM's recently announced intention to groupoccupations for a proposed new examining system undercuts OPM's positionthat grouping was not feasible at the time of the Schedule B decision.However, that view ignores the extensive developmental work which mustprecede any decision to group the different PAC occupations for purposesof examination. Additionally, as has been stated on several occasions,and as OPM has expressed to the Court in the <T3>Luevano </T3>case, OPM's proposal to group occupations into generalcategories for examining purposes has been forwarded to the <T3>Luevano </T3>plaintiffs for their consideration as required under thedecree. OPM is awaiting their response to that proposal and no final decisioncan be reached until that time.The union also asserts that OPM's rationale for using Schedule B was toundermine the consent decree. The facts simply do not support that assertion.Rather than undermining the decree, the use of Schedule B has actuallyenhanced Federal employment opportunities for individuals who belong tominority groups. Prior to the abolition of the PACE in 1982, minority hiringunder PACE averaged only 5.9 percent between 1973 and 1980. After the abolitionof the PACE and under Schedule B, overall minority hiring between 1982to 1986 rose to 22.7 percent. In 1986 and again in 1987, minority hiringrose to 24 percent.It is OPM's plan to establish competitive registers for all remaining PACoccupations at the entry level in the near future. In the interim, agenciesmay continue to utilize Schedule B as an appointing authority where theyare unable to fill PAC positions through internal recruitment. Once competitiveregisters are established for the remaining PAC occupations, agency authorityto use Schedule B to fill PAC occupations will terminate. Incumbent ScheduleB employees who have performed satisfactory service immediately prior tothe date on which the competitive register is established for that occupationmay have their positions converted to competitive appointments pursuantto the regulations at 5 CFR 315.701.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it pertains solely toprocedures for appointment of employees by Federal agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 213</ITAG>Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="21">Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is republishing its final regulation under 5 CFR 213.3202(l),originally published on August 31, 1982 (47 FR 38257) and amended on July6, 1987 (52 FR 25193), as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 213_EXCEPTED SERVICE  </ITAG>1.
