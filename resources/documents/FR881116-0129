The fees, which have remained unchangedsince 1985, apply to on-line Treasury transfers originated, off-line Treasurytransfers originated, and off-line Treasury transfers received. Treasurytransfer reversals are not currently assessed fees. Based on a recent review of book-entry costs and volumes, the Treasurydetermined that the cost of providing the Treasury book-entry transferservice in 1989 will increase, even though the volume of Treasury book-entrytransfers processed between accounts is expected to remain virtually unchanged.To the extent possible, Treasury attempts to establish fees that will recoverthe cost of processing book-entry transfers. Consequently, effective January 3, 1989, the Treasury will: (1) Increasethe fee for on-line Treasury transfers originated from $1.50 to $1.65 pertransfer; (2) increase the fee for off-line Treasury transfers originatedand off-line Treasury transfers received from $6.25 to $6.40 per transfer;and (3) charge a fee to receivers of on-line and off-line Treasury transferreversals ($1.65 per on-line Treasury transfer reversal received and $6.40per off-line Treasury transfer reversal received). No fees are currently proposed for: (1) On- and off-line reversals originatedor (2) transfers to and from collateral accounts supporting borrowingsfrom the Federal Reserve or Treasury deposits (i.e., transfers to and fromDiscount, Treasury Tax andamp; Loan, and Circular 176 accounts). The determination to charge fees for Treasury transfer reversals receivedis based on the premise that the purpose of transfer reversals is to enablethe receiver (the original sender) to correct original transfers that weresent in error, and that the original sender should absorb the cost of processingthe transfer reversal. Because the processing and associated costs of transferreversals are identical to those of regular securities transfers, the Treasuryintends to charge the same fee for transfer reversals received that itcurrently charges for regular securities transfers. The cumulative effect of these developments is expected to be a net increasein total Treasury transfer fees for 1989 commensurate with the anticipatedincrease in the cost of providing the Treasury transfer service. The Treasuryexpects that the new fees will result in the full recovery of the costsassociated therewith. The fees described in this notice apply only to the transfer of Treasurybook-entry securities. The Federal Reserve System assesses fees to recoverthe costs associated with the processing of the funds component of Treasurybook-entry transfer messages, and the costs associated with providing book-entryservices for Government agencies. The Federal Reserve fees for these servicesare set out in a separate notice published November 4, 1988, by the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System. While Treasury book-entry tranfer fees will increase, Federal Reserve feesfor the funds component of Treasury book-entry tranfers will decrease,leaving the combined fees for Treasury book-entry tranfers unchanged for1989.
