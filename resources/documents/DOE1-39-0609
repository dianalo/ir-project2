In this paper the possibilityof the application of the sum peak method to specimens with finite dimensionis studied theoretically, and proved to be successful. Furthermore, thepossibility of application of the sum peak method to the determinationsof the time differential attenuation factor G/sub 22(/t) is discussed,and its procedure is proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
