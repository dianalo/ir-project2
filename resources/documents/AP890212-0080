However, the PLO leader said the Israeli government also wasplanning ``new attacks on our leadership,'' according to aninterview in the Rome-based daily Il Messaggero.   Israeli authorities ``are sending us many messages secretly,through our representatives in the occupied territories (and) otherchannels in Europe and elsewhere,'' Arafat said in the interviewpublished Saturday.   Israel officially says it will not negotiate directly with thePLO.   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``The ministryof foreign affairs has had no contacts wth the PLO'' and that he hadno knowledge of planned attacks on PLO leaders.   PLO officials have held unofficial meetings with members of thecenter-left Labor Party and left-wing members of Parliament.   Asked who contacted the PLO, Arafat said: ``I'm speaking ofIsraeli authorities. And in the past there were also these kinds ofindirect contacts. Also during the occupation of Beirut there werenegotiations through Philip Habib, the special (U.S.) envoy fromWashington.''   Israel sent troops into Lebanon in 1982, forcing the PLO toabandon Beirut.   Arafat said in spite of the contacts, he has received informationthat the Israeli secret service has orders to ``bring forth newattacks on our leadership.'' He did not give details.   ``At the same time, (the Israelis) are planning a scenario of warin southern Lebanon'' for the late spring or summer, he said.   Israeli troops and Palestinian guerrillas have clashed frequentlyin south Lebanon since Israel withdrew most of its soldiers from theneighboring country in 1985. Israeli troops remain in Israel'sself-designated security zone along the border.   Arafat also said he would agree to Israeli Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin's proposal to hold elections in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip only ``after the withdrawal of Israelitroops and under United Nations supervision.''   In the past, PLO leaders have said they will not agree toelections in the occupied territories until the area receivescomplete autonomy.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said Israel's army wouldwithdraw from several cities in the occupied territories if thePalestinian inhabitants accepted ``limited autonomy.''</TEXT></DOC>
