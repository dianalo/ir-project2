Commercialflights were canceled in the area of the attack.   Before dawn today, Iranian gunboats raided a merchant vessel inthe Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Persian Gulf, and set the shipablaze, shipping executives said.   The executives identified the ship as the Atlantic Ocean andsaid it had a Korean crew. They had no further details.   U.S. military investigators today reportedly interviewed thecommander and senior officers of the USS Vincennes as an officialinquiry into the shooting of the Airbus 300 began. All 290 peopleon board Iran Air Flight 655 were killed.   Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's heir-apparent, urgedIran's patriarch in a letter to order terrorist attacks againstU.S. targets worldwide.   In the letter, Montazeri asked Khomeini, 87, to call on``revolutionary cells ... to unleash their wrath on Americanfinancial, political and military targets everywhere.''   Tehran radio reported that President Ali Khamenei sent lettersto heads of state claiming Iran has the ``right to avenge the bloodof innocent children, men and women.''   Khamenei asked other nations to condemn the United States forthe downing of Flight 655, which he said ``roused a wave of rage inIran.''   In the Persian Gulf, airport sources said commercial flightswere canceled or diverted in several countries because of thedowning of the jet.   Iran Air stopped its daily flights from the Iranian airport ofBandar Abbas to Dubai airport, airline sources said. The route isthe same that Flight 655 took when it was hit.   U.S. officials said the warship shot down the Iranian jetlinerbecause its officers believed the plane was an Iranian F-14 fighterjet. A key goal of the inquiry will be to establish why the systemdid not distinguish between the wide-bodied airliner and a militaryjet.   Under a 15-day deadline and a tight lid of secrecy, thesix-member team went to work, hours after arriving in the gulf lateTuesday, military sources said.   The group, led by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, a senior staffofficer at U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla.,includes a military lawyer and technical experts who will analyzecomputer tapes, communications records and other data.   The Navy refused to give the current location of the 9,600-tonVincennes. In New York, the Iranian Mission to the United Nationssaid Tuesday that the doomed airliner had signaled that it was acivilian plane. In Toronto, an Iranian official said the Airbus wasstill climbing when it was hit and had not received any U.S.warnings.   U.S. officials have said the plane did not signal it was acivilian airliner, that it was descending as it approached theVincennes, following a typical attack pattern, and that sevenwarnings were sent to the plane on both military and civilianchannels.   American sources in the gulf, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said that U.S. warships had at least twice been involvedin mix-ups with civilian planes before.   One officer said that about a month ago, an airliner thought aU.S. warship was trying to order it to change course when the shipwas talking by radio to a different plane.   Another U.S. military source said a U.S. frigate, making itsfirst trip into the gulf through the Strait of Hormuz in mid-June,briefly locked its weapons radar on an airliner but quicklyrealized the mistake.   ``These crews are always nervous when they come into the gulffor the first time,'' said the source. ``And one thing they don'tseem to get the word on is how much commercial air traffic there isout here.''   Iran accuses the United States of supporting Iraq in the PersianGulf war, which began in September 1980. The United States'official position is that it is neutral and its forces are in thegulf to protect neutral shipping, which Iran has been attacking.</TEXT></DOC>
