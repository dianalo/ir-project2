The majestic continent at the bottom of the world, larger thanUnited States and Mexico combined, is still peopled by scantthousands who have to import everything but ice cubes.   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antarctica, and seven claimslices of it, no one holds title. No one needs a passport. It is avast global common, ruled only by the harsh, unforgiving elements.   But statesmen, scientists and environmentalists must decide soonwhether Antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen, miners,commercial fishermen, hotelkeepers and, possibly, colonists.   In Paris, beginning Monday, 33 nations will review the 1959Antarctic Treaty that expires in 1991. They also will examine theremains of the Antarctic Minerals Convention, signed in May 1988.   The convention would have allowed controlled mining and oilexploration, replacing a voluntary moratorium. But Australia, oneof seven claimant nations with a veto, decided not to ratify it.   The United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, among others, arepressing for a minerals accord. France, echoing Australia'sconcerns, wants Antarctica to be an unspoiled world park.   Delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise. The 1988convention took six years to negotiate.   Proponents say a world short of resources has no choice.Antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold, platinum and otherstrategic metals, along with oil in amounts estimated to be in thebillions of barrels.   Detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitablypollutes a reserve crucial to man's survival. Upsetting itsdelicate balance, they say, will have consequences no one canpredict.   Undeniably, the world is already muscling in. Penguin livers aretainted with pesticides and plastics. Century-old garbage litterspristine panoramas. Antarctica has had its first oil spill.   ``Trash thrown into the North Sea will eventually settle inAntarctica,'' the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau oncetold The Associated Press. ``The world is a closed system.''   In a more recent interview, he railed against plans to exploitthe last untamed place on earth.   ``That would be almost criminal, at least stupid,'' he said.``It would be a catastrophe.''   Scientists worry that tourists, whose numbers now approach10,000 a year, endanger fragile ecosystems. Huge ice floes menaceships' hulls, adding a threat of oil pollution.   Yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent, largelyunexplored for all of history's daring expeditions, that make itsuch a disputed prize.   Antarctica is 98 percent under ice, but it is no more a whitecontinent than Africa is a dark one.   Old ice grows blue, then rich turquoise. As the sun shifts itsangle over floating ice and the glacier beyond, Antarctica is aglowin pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas.   Penguin colonies, like rush-hour crowds dressed in black tie,amuse scientists who try to take them seriously. Seals frolic andbirds move from place to place in turbulent clouds.   For all the beauty, arguments focus on survival of the planet.   President Francois Mitterrand of France, making the case for aworld wilderness area, told scientists from 40 countries at a Junemeeting: ``It's not just the forests, the prairies or rivers thatare in danger. It's the entire Earth.''   Specialists regard Antarctica as the world's weather factory.   For 10 years, scientists there have measured the Earth'sthinning ozone layer, letting through radiation that riskscatastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels.   A New Zealand team recently reported the ozone hole overAntarctica was much more serious than previously believed.   Cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invitescalamity. For example, just scraping the surface of the Earthspreads dust that alters reflectivity, raising temperatures andmelting ice.   Human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birdsand marine mammals, scientists say. Fishing threatens a delicatefood chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill, a tinyshrimp.   In Antarctica, with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds,accidents are common. Once damage is done, experience shows, it isvery difficult to correct.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
