They threw hundreds of firebombs at police, whoresponded with tear gas.   The protesters also denounced President Roh Tae-woo, accusing himof trying to protect Chun, an old friend and former associate. Rohis scheduled to appear on nationwide TV at 10 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m.EST Friday night) to appeal for public mercy for his disgracedpredecessor.   In a nationally televised speech Wednesday, Chun apologized forcorruption and abuse of power under his authoritarian government. Hesaid he was surrendering all of his personal property, worth $24million, and going into exile in the country _ a traditional pathfor disgraced former leaders.   Chun has denied any personal corrutpion, but some of hisrelatives and associates have been convicted of or charged withembezzlement and other offenses.   Dissident groups have said Chun's apology is not enough, and theyare demanding that he be prosecuted. The country's main oppositionparties have demanded further explanations from Chun.   The protesters in Seoul were among 2,000 students who earlierrallied at the city's Dongguk University to demand Chun's arrest.After the rally, about half of them stormed out of the school toclash with police in streets and alleyways.   Several thousand riot police in green combat fatigues andblack-visored helmets ringed the campus to stop students fromleaving. Police fired volleys of choking tear gas and hurled rocksand other missiles.   No arrests or injuries were reported.   Protesters also burned an effigy of Roh and chanted: ``Punish RohTae-woo!''   Some Buddhist monks also joined in the protest and shouted:``Drive Chun from our sacred temple!'' Chun has taken refuge in aremote Buddhist monastery on the east coast.   In another protest Friday in the central city of Taejon, about250 student radicals marched through downtown streets demandingChun's arrest. No clashes took place.   Roh is trying to defuse public anger against Chun withoutdamaging himself or his government, which many see as a continuationof the Chun government.   On Thursday, Roh came a step closer to pardoning Chun, telling agroup of ruling party officials that ``enough has been done.   ``As a long friend, I felt deep sorrow for the former president,who had to leave in such a way,'' Roh was quoted as saying. ``Anylegal action against him is not only undesirable but also againstthe repeated promise by all opposition leaders objecting topolitical reprisals.''   In his TV speech Saturday, Roh also was expected to promisedemocratic reforms and announce specific measures to compensate forthe offenses of the Chun era.   Officials said the measures would include the reinstatement ofthousands of illegally purged government officials and financialcompensation for victims of the brutal military suppression of a1980 civil uprising. According to official count, the militarykilled some 200 people in the uprising in the southern city ofKwangju.</TEXT></DOC>
