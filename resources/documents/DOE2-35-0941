A weighted regression analysis was used to examinethe air pollution-lung cancer mortality relation for white males in HarrisCounty, Texas, 1979-1981. The regression model included the followingcensus tract-specific characteristics: median age for white males, twosocial and demographic factors not strongly correlated with pollution(family life cycle and migration), an age-dependent smoking index, anda pollution measure based on total suspended particulates. This modelindicated a statistically significant contribution of the pollution measurein explaining the intracounty variation in lung cancer mortality rates.The relation between air pollution and lung cancer mortality, however,appeared to be highly dependent on which social and demographic factorswere selected for inclusion in the analysis. Air pollution was not demonstratedto be a strong determinant of lung cancer mortality in this study inthat the presence of air pollution accounted for less than 5% of thetotal variation in intraurban lung cancer mortality. In addition, theinterpretation of geographic analysis must be guarded due to the introductionof potential bias due to aggregation. The hypothesis that air pollutionis contributory to lung cancer cannot be tested until other, strongerindividual risk factors for lung cancer can be better measured and controlledin studies of this association.</TEXT></DOC>
