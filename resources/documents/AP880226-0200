Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The general accused the United States of instigating Delvalle'sfailed effort on Thursday to end his military rule and saidWashington waged a campaign of ``psychological warfare'' againsthim.   Noriega addressed a rally of his supporters Friday night andsaid Panamanians who consider ``betrayal, because they are borntraitors, meet a bad end here.''   Up to 10,000 people attended the rally at the central garrisonof the Defense Forces.   The Noriega-dominated National Assembly turned Delvalle out ofoffice in a 10-minute session early Friday after the presidenttried to fire the armed forces chief following Noriega's indictmentin the United States as a drug trafficker.   Noriega has denied all accusations against him.   The legislature named Manuel Solis Palma, the educationminister, as new president, but Delvalle insisted to reporters hewas still president.   In Washington, the State Department said it still recognizedDelvalle as Panama's president.   Delvalle told reporters Friday night, ``I don't have a seat ofgovernment, nor military support, but I do have two millionPanamanians who are tired ... of living under a regime that one manhas governed capriciously, and because of that I call for nationalresistance to paralyze the entire country starting Monday.''   The opposition National Civic Crusade on Friday evening calledfor a ``progressive, nationwide strike'' starting immediately.   Aurelio Barrilla, president of the Panamanian Chamber ofCommerce and Industry, one of the groups in the coalition, said theCrusade was seeking ``total paralysis'' of the country by earlynext week.   However, only one of several strikes called last summer by thecoalition of about 200 organizations was notably successful, andthe government has shut down opposition newspapers, radio andtelevision stations, limiting the Crusade's ability to spread itsmessage.   In his address at the central garrison rally, Noriega said,``The Defense Forces offer subordination, total support and ourcooperation to the new president, our best efforts to be able toreach presidential elections in May 1989.''   ``Panama is not a tribe,'' he said. ``The Americans who live inPanama should sleep easy, because this people is not a tribe, it isa healthy people.''   Panama, a nation of 2.2 million people, is headquarters for U.S.military programs in Latin America with the U.S. Southern Commandthat has 10,000 military personnel and their 20,000 dependents inPanama.   After the rally, Noriega walked with his supporters to thepresidential offices about a mile away.   Throughout the day there were fewer vehicles and people on thestreets, but Panama City was calm and businesses operated normally.   Delvalle said the protest strike would be peaceful, saying, ``Idon't pretend to be the leader of the resistance. I pretend to bethe president who returns to the presidency.'' He also urged aworldwide trade embargo against Panama.   He called Solis Palma ``an opportunistic politician.''   Delvalle's bid to remove Noriega as head of Panama's15,000-member Defense Forces was thwarted Thursday night when themilitary closed ranks around the general and said no officer wouldreplace him.   President Reagan said the United States was not behindDelvalle's attempt to get rid of Noriega but was ``very much awareof it.'' He said there were no plans for military intervention.   The White House called on Noriega to resign after he wasindicted Feb. 5 in Florida on drug trafficking charges. Noriega wasaccused of using his authority to let Colombian drug traffickersutilize Panama as a base for smuggling cocaine and marijuana intothe United States. The charges said Noriega received kickbacks fromdrug profits.   Soldiers on Friday surrounded and closed the Chamber of Commercebuilding, headquarters for the National Civic Crusade.   Opponents of Noriega met elsewhere to discuss actions to protesthis rule.   Police closed the offices of the Christian Democratic Party,whose president, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has been a leader of theCrusade movement.   Arias Calderon and a Miami Herald reporter, Andres Oppenheimer,were detained for two hours Thursday night when they arrived on acommercial flight from Miami. Oppenheimer was released but AriasCalderon was put on a flight to Costa Rica.   Panamanian authorities refused entry to three Americanjournalists when they tried to land early Friday in a charter planefrom Costa Rica.   Miami Herald Central America correspondent Sam Dillon,Washington Post correspondent Julia Preston and John Siceloff, aNicaragua-based producer for NBC-TV returned to Costa Rica.   The rally was Noriega's first appearance in public sinceDelvalle acted. In an interview broadcast by the government's RadioNacional earlier Friday, he said of the United States: ``They havebeen using a web that includes psychological warfare ... slander,lies, injury, conjecture, and ... misinformation.''   Asked if there was U.S. involvement in Delvalle's attempt tooust him, Noriega said: ``Totally, they have maintained a web.''   He said Delvalle ``is in his home, with his family, without anyproblem.''   Relations between the Reagan administration and Noriega havedeteriorated since June, when opposition leaders launched acampaign of strikes and protests in Panama to force the general out.   Protests began after Noriega's former second in command, retiredCol. Roberto Diaz Herrera, accused Noriega of drug trafficking,fraud and assassinating political opponents.   Noriega issued a statement through his attorneys in Miami inwhich he denounced U.S. politicians he said advocate ``hysteria(and) act with a reckless disregard for the truth.''   The statement also said, ``All American interests in therepublic are and shall remain undisturbed and unharmed.'' It added``these events are strictly internal to Panama.   The Panama Canal operated normally Friday.   American military personnel were on alert and civilians weretold to keep a low profile.   The White House immediately offered its support after Delvalleannounced his intention to oust Noriega, but Noriega and hissupporters moved quickly against Delvalle.   Solis Palma, 71, will fill out the current presidential term,which ends in October 1989.   The National Assembly removed both Delvalle and Vice PresidentRoderick Esquivel from office, saying Delvalle violated the law intrying to fire Noriega.</TEXT></DOC>
