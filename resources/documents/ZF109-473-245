(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>To evaluate the effects of high volume image traffic on network performance,we examine some of the raciest traffic around medical images on fiber opticnetworks.andM;Many IS managers claim Ethernet, the rock solid, widely deployed net, astheir network of choice.andP;  And a number of organizations are using Ethernetsuccessfully for image transfer.andP;  But those with a large amount of imagetraffic are finding that Ethernet tends to flounder under the bursty demandand large data sets associated with image traffic.andP;  With today's applicationsrequiring more bandwidth and with public communications networks offeringhigh bandwidth interconnections, network managers are looking for performancebeyond Ethernet.andM;Although  Ethernet is a 10-megabit network, real-world installationsdelivering even 2Mb of end-to-end throughput are hard to find.andP;  In mostbusiness environments this does not present a problem.andP;  But for imagetraffic, users will find it too slow.andP;  For  example, &quot;for a 4-megabyte[32-megabit] image, it takes us about 45 seconds to transfer it on ourEthernet,&quot; says Brent Stewart, assistant professor of radiology at UCLA.andM;Stewart, who was part of a team evaluating high-speed networks for theuniversity's medical-imaging division, sees medical traffic as a worst-casefor networking.andP;  The only big difference between imaging and just shipping abunch of files around is the size of the data file.&quot;andM;Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital is one of many institutions thatuse Ethernet networks.andP;  Says Jaime Taaffe, Mass.andP;  General's director ofradiology computing, &quot;We use conventional Ethernet to transfer command andcontrol information between workstations and the processing and storageelements of our system.andP;  But Ethernet is inadequate to send high-resolutionimages in a timely fashion.andP;  For us, that means less than a second.&quot; Taaffe,who is also director of the hospital's Radiology Storage Transfer AnalysisReporting (RSTAR) project, knows what he's talking about.andP;  His departmentsupports more than 350,000 radiological exams a year.andM;Mass.andP;  General is among those pioneering the use of networks to relaydigitized X-ray images and other diagnostic information.andP;  Electronic storageof digital X-ray eliminates libraries of old film; transferring the imagesover networks allows instant access by doctors in remote locations.andO;Similarly, doctors can participate in diagnostic procedures off site as they re being done and can discuss them with the attending surgeon in a voice/data/image conference call.andM;As UCLA's Stewart points out, the challenge here is quick transmission.andO;Digitized X-rays consume 4 megabytes of data each.andP;  Computerized tomographyscans, a more complex type of X-ray, eat up 8 megabytes.andP;  Doctors will onlyuse a digitized X-ray system, warns Taaffe, if it's quicker than using atraditional X-ray.andP;  &quot;Today, the average chest film is up and read anddictated and gone in 60 seconds.&quot;andM;Taaffe's group has fashioned its own approach to reducing transmission timesto less than a second.andP;  &quot;We use a 100megabits-per-second optical LAN of ourown design to deliver image data to the workstations,&quot; says Taaffe.andP;  &quot;Theoptical network is not really acting like a LAN.andP;  We take 12 megabytes persecond of the bandwidth and just blast data point to point.andP;  &quot;andM;An image of 2,648 x 2,048 pixels x 12 bits (6 megabytes) can be transferredfrom the central archive to a workstation on the network in less than asecond.andM;Fiber Distributed Data Interface or FDDI networks--with 100 megabits/secondbandwidth--offer some hope for higher throughput.andP;  But since FDDI andEthernet share a model for data transfer between the applications and thenetwork, and since both rely on host software to perform protocol processing,FDDI may not be able to deliver a much greater percentage of its bandwidththan Ethernet.andP;  UCLA's Stewart comments, &quot;We were able to push 1.85MBbps[14.8 megabits per second] over FDDI but didn't think it would provide uswith the bandwidth we needed.&quot;andM;For most organizations considering FDDI, effective bandwidth is a keyconcern.andP;  &quot;Twenty-four to 30 megabits of end-to-end throughput would be avery successful installation on FDDI,&quot; says Tom Russell, marketing managerfor network products at Ultra Network Technologies in San Jose.andM;Ultra Network manufactures and markets super-high-speed network componentsthat off-load protocol processing from the host to UltraNet silicon.andP;  Theresult is a very fast network.andP;  Clinical TrialsandM;In a demonstration, an UltraNet unit supported data transfer between a Cray 2supercomputer and a frame buffer at 747Mbps.andP;  And in April of 1990, at theCeBIT Fair in Hanover, West Germany, an UltraNet running across 600kilometers (372.6 miles) 6f optical fiber sustained end-to-end transmissionexceeding 90Mbps over a 100Mbps channel.andP;  This is good news for enterpriseswith a need for bandwidth but without the resources to develop their owntechnology.andM;One such organization is the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.andP;  There,director of radiology information systems Ethan Fenner has taken his Ethernetabout as far as it can go.andP;  The trouble is, that's not far enough.andM;&quot;At the Brigham, imaging and non-imaging networks are both Ethernet, but theyare bridged together so that if traffic needs to cross over them it can,&quot;says Fenner.andP;  &quot;There's a fiber backbone that runs throughout the campus; endto end it's probably three-quarters of a mile.andP;  The problem is that weprovide diagnostic support to the Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP) [ahealth maintenance organization], which has sites as much as 30 miles away.andM;&quot;The solution could be a new broadband service that NYNEX Corp. and NewEngland Telephone are testing in the metropolitan Boston area.andP;  For thisMedia Broadband Services (MBS) trial, a mix of DS1 (1.5Mbps), DS3 (45Mbps)and higher speed links (135 and 565M  bps) use fiber-optic cables to connectfacilities at four area hospitals--Taaffe's and Fenner's included--as well asat various Boston-area HCHP clinics.andM;&quot;In the trial,&quot; explains Fenner, &quot;we're putting imaging workstations atseveral HCHP care centers.andP;  With the DS3 links, we can transmit both theoriginal images and the diagnostic report--the interpretation of theimages--to the referring physicians who requested the studies.&quot;andM;The referring physician, located at one of the HCHP clinics, will be able tolisten to an on-line audio interpretation from the radiologist at thehospital, read a text report or look at the images.andP;  A telephone orspeakerphone can also be attached, allowing the physician to carry on aconversation with a radiologist at the other end of the fiber.andP;  The resultwill be more timely, informed health care decisions and better care.andM;Better care is just what John Brenner, director of the image analysislaboratory at New England Medical Center in Boston, has in mind.andP;  For him,this means better diagnoses based on improved imaging techniques and moreinformed interpretation of the images.andM;&quot;We want not only to send an occasional image or half-dozen images weactually want to be able to send a digital film loop from one laboratory orclinical center to another,&quot; Brenner says.andP;  &quot;In our case, we've chosen thecardiac catheterization procedure as the prototype application.&quot; An FDDI linkwill be used initially, with a DS3 or higher-speed line planned for thefuture.andM;In this procedure, a catheter or tube is inserted through a blood vessel inthe patient's leg and travels up nearly into the coronary artery of theheart.andP;  As a radio-opaque dye is forced through the catheter, it highlightsthe coronary arteries and the heart muscle.andP;  While the physician is watchingthe procedure on a screen, a cine-X-ray system--that is, a cinematic, ormotion-picture, X-ray system--captures images at 30 frames per second,typically at 1,024 x 1,024 x 8 bits resolution.andP;  Although it's possible tosend continuous motion film over the network, in this application the doctorsinject dye and transmit a 5-second film for the referring physician.andM;Brenner describes how the MBS network supports this consultation: &quot;During theearly stages of this trial, the referring physicians will be located at theFaulkner Hospital [in jamaica Plain, Mass.].... A fiber-based connection willlink the cardiologist's workstation to that of the consulting or referringphysician.andP;  The images--a 5-second, full-motion digital loop of thecatheterization procedure--will be downloaded to the remote station.&quot;andM;Either party then has the ability to select images from the batch and tocontrol the playback of the loop.andP;  Real-time transmission of frame numbersassures that the two displays are synchronized.andP;  Since the two parties haveto be able to talk, there is also a voice channel.andP;  And finally, a person at,for instance, New England Medical Center can move a pointer around the screenwith a mouse; the pointer is replicated in real time on the screen at theFaulkner, and vice versa.andM;&quot;So, with voice, with the ability to select and display images and with thepointers, it's possible to have what amounts to a conference between twophysicians in remote locations,&quot; says Brenner.andM;Don't Stop the PressesandM;The use of digital images, motion video and audio to make collaborationpossible among workers at separate sites is not limited to medicalapplications.andP;  Gail Pierson is director of systems and operations for theChristian Science Publishing Society in Boston.andP;  The Publishing Society, thepublishing arm of the Church of Christ, Scientist, produces newspapers,magazines, books and programs for both radio and TV.andP;  Pierson looks to theMedia Broadband Service to link the organization's separate units.andM;&quot;We have four elements that we will network together,&quot; says Pierson.andP;  &quot;TheScitex print production area, the print newsroom, the  Today's Monitor'TV-show and the TV graphics area.... Any point needs to be able to sessionwith the others.andP;  Our goal is on-line sharing of images and information amongall our productions and publications.andM;Pierson's Ethernet network has presented its share.andP;  of challenges.andP;  &quot;Thestandard Ethernet just hasn't been up to carrying the images as well as therest of our traffic.andP;  A typical newspaper page would be about 25 megabytes,both text and graphics.andP;  And that's at newspaper resolution; it's higher atmagazine resolution.andP;  Our approach has been to just keep adding segments ofbaseband until we can get our fiber in place.andM;&quot;Actually, we've divided our complex into more than one baseband,&quot; Piersonsays.andP;  &quot;This way, we can run as many Ethernets as we want and bridge themtogether.andP;  We put graphics on its own baseband that uses the entire 10megabits, as opposed to fighting for traffic slots with the text that'sflowing back and forth.&quot;andM;The publishing society plans to install fiber-optic cable to supplement itsinternal networks, in addition to connecting to New England Telephone'scentral office.andP;  The NYNEX MBS trial will link the society's Boston-area,off-premise facilities to the main campus buildings over DS1 lines, providingessentially Ethernet-speed connections.andM;&quot;We are on a wide area network, with links to bureaus in London; Washington,D.C.; and Tokyo but are not yet doing any international multimedia traffic,&quot;Pierson says.andP;  If this high-speed networking experiment goes beyond the trialphase to a tariffed public broadband service, these high-bandwidth linkscould be extended to wherever fiber is in place.andM;More Affordable BroadbandandM;The NYNEX MBS trial is still in its early stages, NYNEX says, but a number ofthings are clear.andP;  &quot;Raw transport looks good right now; DS3 [45Mbps] seems tobe highly acceptable to the user.andP;  The big challenge is gettingprice/performance to an appropriate place,&quot; says Terry McGarty, president ofNYNEX Network Services and former director of research and development.andM;McGarty says that right now casual users, such as a radiologist who only usesthe system for an hour a day, will find a leased DS3 circuit expensive.andO;&quot;That's why there's a full court press to develop SMDS--switchedmulti-megabit digital services--so that the price/performance will be there.&quot;andO;SMDS promises to provide on-demand 45Mbps service rather than a dedicatedconnection, which today is the only widely available DS3 option.andM;Although DS3 connectivity may be straightforward from the telephone company'spoint of view, connecting workstations to DS3 equipment is a different story.andO;There are no commercially available interfaces today, but NYNEX engineersanticipate beta versions of future off-the-shelf products in September.andO;Another stumbling block could be the receiving workstation's ability toabsorb data at this rate.andP;  &quot; Forty-five megabits per second is pushing thelimits of many workstations,&quot; observes McGarty.andM;Nathan Feldy, director of the Media Laboratory at NYNEX's Corporate Scienceand Technology division, says,andM;Perhaps the most important thing we learned was that a classic datacommunications model was not comprehensive enough to support work with imagesin sessions.andP;  The key thing here is to step beyond the communicationsparadigm.andP;  We really are involved in a conversational paradigm.andP;  Now, thatmodel--that conversational model--is a richer model, it's a tougher model,and it's not well accommodated by computer networks today.&quot;andM;Scott Wallace is a Wanvick, Mass.-based independent analyst and consultant inimaging technologies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
