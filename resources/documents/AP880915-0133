Gun-owner and pro-regulation groups have fought their latestall-out battle over the waiting period, with both sides bringingrank-and-file police officers to lobby House members.   The waiting period is already included in the comprehensive billthat would add some $2 billion to the nation's $3.9 billion drugfighting effort.   The week-long delay would permit police where the purchaserlives to conduct a background check, but would not require one.   President Reagan has publicly supported a handgun waitingperiod, but has not specifically endorsed the drug bill provisionsof the ``Brady Amendment.'' The measure was symbolically namedafter presidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot alongwith Reagan in the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt againstthe president.   Brady's wife, Sarah, has become a leading gun controlspokeswoman on behalf of Handgun Control Inc. The powerful NationalRifle Association is her main opposition.   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., has authored an amendment toeliminate the waiting period.   His amendment would order the Justice Department to develop _within 180 days _ a system that would allow gun dealers to checkwhether the applicant is a convicted felon.   McCollum has said the system, which would be submitted toCongress, could include a telephone check such as the one thatstores use to verify that credit cards are valid.   The waiting period would require a gun dealer, within a day of apurchaser's application, to send a sworn application from thepurchaser to the chief law enforcement officer where the buyerlives.   The application would include a description of the pistol; itsserial number; the name, address and birth date of the purchasertaken from a photo identification; and a statement that federal lawdoes not prohibit the receipt of the gun by the buyer.   The purchaser could pick up the weapon if nothing is heard fromhis hometown police agency within seven days or the police issue acertificate that the buyer requires the gun due to a threat on hisor her life.   If a dealer receives a police report after the seven daysstating that the transfer would violate the law, the dealer mustnotify police in his own area, and give police in the buyer's homearea all information about the transaction.   The police agency that permitted the transaction must destroythe records within 60 days after the date on the applicant'sstatement, unless the purchase involved a violation of law.   Violating the requirements could bring a maximum $1,000 fine anda one-year prison term.   States that already have at least a seven day waiting period anda mandatory background check could enforce their laws instead ofthe federal provisions. In all other cases, the federal languagewould prevail.   The bill would leave unchanged the categories of buyers who areineligible to purchase a handgun: convicted felons, the mentallyill, drug addicts, fugitives, illegal aliens and those dishonorablydischarged from the military.   The waiting period would take effect 90 days after the drug billbecame law.</TEXT></DOC>
