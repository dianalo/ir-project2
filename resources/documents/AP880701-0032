Here is a listing of each contract and some of the informationallegedly passed by Saunders:   _From September 1987 through April 1988, Saunders got from Stonea steady stream of information, including sealed bids of 10competing companies, about a $120 million Marine Corps-Navycontract for an Advanced Tactical Air Command Control system.   _Saunders got advance word in December 1987 from Stone about a$32 million contract for secure Navy radio equipment.   _Stone called Saunders at home in January 1988 to give him thenames of the finalists, which he called the ``inside skinny,'' on a$10 million Navy contract for a Tactical Environmental SupportSystem. Saunders told Muldoon that this data was hard to get andnow ``we can't even make any money on it.''   _In November 1987, Saunders provided Muldoon with a draft of thegovernment's plan for acquiring a $50 million Fiber Optics CableSystem.   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon the company he wasworking for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for amore than $100 million Digital Wide-Band Transmission Systemcontract.   _In August 1987, Saunders told Muldoon about an internal Navysplit over how to handle a $10 million contract for a prototype ofa sonar system.   _In July 1987, Saunders told Muldoon that a $100 millionAnti-Submarine Warfare Operation Center contract might have to berestructured and rebid.   _In November 1987, Stone told Saunders of a decision that dayabout a $100 million Digital Communications Terminal contract.   _The ninth contract was to be for radios, at an undisclosedprice.

The FBI said that in a series of conversations from September toDecember of 1987, Bradley and Saunders discussed how to write theacquisition plan ``to make it difficult for other companies tocompete with Varian.''</TEXT></DOC>
