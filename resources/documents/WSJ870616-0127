Asbestos Inc. to avoid the threatened closure of an asbestos mine in Quebec next year.    The province said it will guarantee 85% of a 50 million Canadian dollar ($37.3 million) loan to J.M. Asbestos, a closely held Montreal-based concern that operates the open-pit mine, which it bought from Denver-based Manville Corp. in 1982. The mine is in Asbestos, Quebec.    The loan is part of a 75 million dollar plan to expand the mine's reserves and allow it to keep operating until 1994. Without the expansion, the mine was threatened with closure next year. Closure would mean the loss of 715 jobs.    Under terms of the guarantee, the government said J.M. Asbestos agreed to merge its sales and marketing operations with LAB Chrysotile, a partnership of Quebec's three other asbestos-mining concerns, two of which are controlled by the province. The province said the merged sales operation would help increase exports and cut costs for all four concerns.    Quebec's asbestos mining concerns have slashed production in recent years as demand for the mineral has declined in light of health concerns.    The government also said that unionized employees at J.M. Asbestos agreed to five million dollars in salary reductions as part of the plan to keep the mine open and that the company's owners agreed not to declare any dividends until the loan is fully repaid. </TEXT></DOC>
