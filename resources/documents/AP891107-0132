The waves of newcomers this year _ nearly 200,000 of them EastGermans making a dramatic exodus to the West _ is starting tooverwhelm West Germany.   East Germans, ethnic Germans from Poland and the Soviet Union,and asylum-seekers are rapidly changing the face of the nation.Those three groups are expected to account for about 700,000newcomers this year.   West Germany, with a population of nearly 62 million, has beenan economic success story and has become a magnet for East Germans,as well as the ethnic Germans across Eastern Europe.   Although West Germany has welcomed them, there is increasinguneasiness about the thousands of new citizens.   ``We have to tell them that West Germany is not a paradise,''West German trade union federation chief Ernst Breit told a postalworkers' conference on Sunday in Mannheim.   While Breit was referring to the expectations of the EastGermans, many politicians, business leaders and ordinary WestGermans are beginning to question the country's ability to handlethe strains posed by the newcomers.   Social services have been strapped and the influx of childrenhas filled kindergartens to capacity nationwide. Clothing drivesfor the new arrivals have become an almost daily occurrence.   Local governments have been crying out for more federal aid tobear the load, and unemployment is swelling to nearly 2 million.   There was a shortage of affordable housing even before EastGermany's Communist authorities found themselves unable to holdback the flood and East Germans fled by the thousands.   Tuesday's approval of $4.3 billion to subsidize construction ofthe new apartments over a four-year period is nearly twice theamount planned for low-cost housing just a few months ago. ButChancellor Helmut Kohl's government felt it had to act to ease thehousing crisis.   As housing shortages persist, social services are overloaded andunemployment rises, the government is expected to face demands foraction to slow the flow of newcomers.   West German politicians have shown increasing signs of alarm andhave called on East German authorities to institute reforms to haltthe exodus.   ``We want them (East Germans) to be able to live in theirtraditional home there and to be able to find happiness,'' Kohltold a Red Cross convention on Saturday.   Many of the East German refugees are being put up in hotels andothers have been housed in camps or on floating barracks designedfor construction workers.   East Germans put up in a temporary shelter in a camping area inHamburg have already staged a protest, complaining of ``unbearableconditions'' and saying they can't afford the $43 they have to payper month, per person.   But housing is only one of the problems.   The federal labor office said Monday the number of unemployedworkers among the East German refugees stood at 61,700 as of lastmonth, out of the total of 167,200 people who had reached WestGermany by then. The total East German refugee number is expectedto top 200,000 by the end of the year.   Still, many employers look at the East Germans as a source ofnew labor, willing to take jobs that West Germans avoid and perhapswilling to work for lower wages.   Ethnic Germans and asylum-seekers already were stretching socialservices and local budgets before August, when the East Germansstarted flowing into West Germany.   ``We still expect between 350,000 and 400,000 ethnic Germansthis year,'' said Ina Ruehl, a Red Cross specialist who helps tointegrate the influx of ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union,Romania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.   She said in an interview with The Associated Press the federalgovernment is spending $1.2 billion this year to teach them German,while many also receive substantial unemployment benefits. As ofOctober, there were 115,000 unemployed among the recent arrivals ofethnic Germans.   West Germany also has attracted huge numbers of politicalasylum-seekers, most of them from Third World countries as well asTurkey, Poland and Yugoslavia.   They benefit from Bonn's liberal policies that allow most of theasylum-seekers stay for years even if their application is rejected.   On Sunday, Bishop Martin Kruse, the head of the Lutheran Churchin West Germany, appealed for more help for the asylum-seekers whoare allowed to stay even if their request is rejected.   ``These people often live for years in legal uncertainty andwithout any outlook for the future,'' Kruse told a churchconvention in Bad Krozingen near Freiburg. Rejection of an asylumapplication generally bars the foreigners from working legally inWest Germany.   On Monday, the federal Interior Ministry announced that 98,700asylum-seekers had arrived in the first 10 months of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
