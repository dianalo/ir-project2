The U.S. moves are a response to its own weakening globaleconomic position rather than to the &quot;needs and interests ofLatin American development and integration,&quot; the declarationsaid. It was signed in Mexico City by representatives oflabor groups in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,Cuba, Chile, the U.S., Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay andVenezuela.   The Initiative of the Americas was unveiled in June 1990as an attempt to encourage free trade in Latin America andstimulate investment, forgiving part of Latin Americannations' debt. The plan was welcomed by governments andbusiness leaders.   The declaration said, among other things, that the accordswould allow U.S. and Canadian interests to &quot;monopolize easy,captive markets and cheap labor.&quot;                                                                                                          PORTUGAL RESUMES PRIVATIZATIONS                                                                                                          Portugal announced the relaunching of its privatizationprogram, setting conditions for the sale of the state'sshares in the second-largest commercial bank and fourtransport companies. A government spokesman said the statewill float its 60% stake in Banco Espirito Santo e Commercialde Lisboa on the Lisbon stock exchange. He didn't give a datefor the flotation, but market sources said the sale is likelyby the end of January.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN ENERGY CHARTER SET                                                                                                          Officials from 36 countries reached agreement on aEuropean Energy Charter that aims to promote East-West energycooperation and help the Soviets exploit their plentiful oiland gas resources. The accord is subject to approval from theSoviet republics, only three of which were represented in theSoviet delegation. The document is scheduled to be signed byministers at a meeting in the Hague next month, and will befollowed by more specific agreements.                                                                                                          IMPACT OF EAST TIMOR KILLINGS   The Netherlands decided to postpone development projectsin Indonesia after last week's massacre in East Timor.Separately, the European Parliament called on the EuropeanCommunity to embargo weapons shipments to Jakarta and askedEC nations to consider suspending aid and cooperationagreements with Indonesia. Jakarta said 19 people were killedin the incident, when the Indonesian military fired ondemonstrators. But sources in East Timor, a Portuguese colonyannexed by Indonesia in 1976, put the death toll as high as150.                                                                                                          HOPES RISE FOR U.S., EC ACCORD                                                                                                          European Community and U.S. trade negotiators will endthree days of talks in Geneva today, with hopes that anaccord on cutting farm subsidies will have come within reach.Yesterday, sources said the two sides appeared close toagreeing on a 30% reduction in the subsidies over five years,but have yet to resolve other issues. A breakthrough onagriculture is needed if the EC and U.S. are to honor theirpledge to conclude the Uruguay Round of world trade talks byyear end.                                                                                                          LATVIA BRACES FOR FUEL SHORTAGE                                                                                                          Soviet petroleum deliveries to Latvia have slowed to atrickle since the Baltic republic broke away in September,Latvian officials said. Latvia received none of the 340,000barrels of gasoline contracted for in September and only8,500 of the 340,000 barrels scheduled for delivery inOctober. Officials refused fuel to passenger cars duringOctober and diverted it to industry, provoking a fear ofshortages that has led to the rise of a black market ingasoline. Latvia's 2.7 million people, using about 20,000barrels of gasoline a day, depend on the Soviet Union for 90%of their energy.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIAN OPPOSITION'S PLAN                                                                                                          Australia's main conservative opposition unveiled aneconomic overhaul plan that centers on a proposed new tax ongoods and services. The package aims also to convinceAustralians to dump the incumbent Labor Party at electionsexpected by early 1993.   John Hewson, the Liberal Party's leader, called onAustralians &quot;to fight back against the Labor government'seconomic mismanagement and policy failures that have resultedin the worst recession since the Great Depression.&quot;   The plan was much more detailed than most people expected.Besides introducing a 15% tax on goods and services, itproposes to cut personal income taxes, raise corporate taxesand abolish several taxes on businesses.   Mr. Hewson's reform package is an attempt to offer votersa clear alternative to the Labor Party led by Prime MinisterBob Hawke.

The ex-head of Poland's central bank was freed after twomonths in prison after a well-known cleric guaranteed hisfuture court appearances.
