In the latest quarter, ended March 30, revenue rose 8% to$3.52 billion from $3.26 billion. That increase was fueled bystronger service revenue and the inclusion of results from anewly acquired, 65%-owned German subsidiary. Per-shareearnings rose to 94 cents from 20 cents a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Net, however, was dragged down by an unexpectedly high taxrate and a loss at at the German subsidiary, Digital-Kienzle,formed in December by Digital and Mannesman A.G. Digital paid$230 million for its majority stake and holds an option tobuy the rest of the company. Without the Kienzle loss,Digital said, per-share net would have been $1.14. Digitalalso said the new unit contributed $79 million tothird-quarter revenue.   The results beat most analysts' expectations, boosting theMaynard, Mass., company's shares $4 to $70.375 in compositeNew York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock tradedas high as $74.25 early in the day.   The nation's second-largest computer maker said servicerevenue jumped 20% to $1.4 billion, but, reflecting weakeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Europe, product saleswere flat, excluding the sales of the new German unit.   Still, &quot;investors were braced for much worse&quot; in the wakeof disappointing results last week from industry leaderInternational Business Machines Corp., said Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co. analyst Barry F. Willman. &quot;We should start tosee improvement from here.&quot;   Analysts said the weak economy cut into sales of bighigh-margin Digital products such as the VAX 9000 mainframecomputer and the VAX 6000 minicomputer. Jay P. Stevens, aDean Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst, said Digital sold only 70of the mainframe-class machines in the quarter as some buyersrescinded planned orders.   Digital acknowledged slow sales of big-ticket items. JohnF. Smith, senior vice president, said that the &quot;uncertainbusiness outlook, heightened by the Middle East conflict, isresulting in delays in customers' investments in technology,particularly for large systems.&quot;   Digital said it made progress cutting expenses,consolidating facilities and restructuring its work forcethrough retraining and redeployment, and more than 2,200people left the payroll in the quarter. While some of thecuts were accomplished through attrition and reassignments,Digital turned to layoffs for the first time in its 34-yearhistory.   Digital's world-wide payroll stands at 122,700, includingabout 3,900 Digital-Kienzle employees added in the quarter.   Analysts think Digital must go still further. &quot;Theyclearly need to keep cutting, right into fiscal 1992,&quot; saysMarc Schulman, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc. This willprobably require another charge against earnings, which couldcome as soon as the current quarter, which ends June 30, orin the first quarter next year, he says.   In the first nine months, net was $253.9 million, or $2.06a share, compared with $331.1 million, or $2.65 a share, ayear ago. Revenue rose 4% to $9.97 billion from $9.58billion.   Mr. Schulman applauded a sharp reduction in Digital'saccounts receivable during the quarter, &quot;making analready-strong balance sheet even stronger.&quot; But he warned,&quot;The real issue continues to be sales demand. World-wideproduct orders were down several percentage points comparedwith last year, and the only area to show an increase wasEurope, due to favorable currency translations.&quot;   Still, Mr. Schulman expects Digital to rebound. &quot;Icontinue to believe there will be a renaissance at Digital,&quot;as new software standards are embraced and new technologiesare adopted, he said.   &quot;This is the year they get costs in shape. Next year isthe year that we should begin to see some real revenuegrowth.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
