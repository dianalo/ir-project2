Arlen Specter and two other Republicanopponents of former Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork hadadopted a ``personal litmus test'' in rejecting Bork's nomination.   ``What clearly emerged during the spectacle of the Judge'sconfirmation hearings was nothing less than an arrogant disdain forgovernment by the people,'' Assistant Attorney General WilliamBradford Reynolds said in remarks prepared for delivery to alawyers group Thursday night in Philadelphia.   Reynolds, who as counselor to the attorney general is Meese'stop aide, said Specter, R-Pa., and other Bork opponents had decidedlast year that ``the only relevant consideration'' in Bork'sconfirmation proceedings ``was a purely result-oriented one.   That consideration, Reynolds said, was whether Bork's views onprivacy, free speech and equal protection coincide with the policypositions ``crafted and fed to the Senators by largely hostilestaffers in collaboration with various interest'' groups.   ``Such an inquisition makes a mockery of the Senate'sconstitutional responsibility,'' Reynolds said. ``There can belittle doubt that the framers (of the Constitution) never intendedfor that legislative `check' to permit judicial nominees to be heldhostage to each senator's personal litmus test.''   He said Republican Sens. Robert Packwood of Oregon and JohnWarner of Virginia, as well as Specter, had adopted the``result-oriented'' approach in the Bork fight. He said the threeRepublicans were part of a ``camp'' that included Democraticmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee: Joseph Biden ofDelaware, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Howard Metzenbaum ofOhio, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Howell Heflin of Alabama and PaulSimon of Illinois.   Reynolds said Bork, who had been an appeals court judge inWashington, had arrived at his views ``out of an abiding commitmentto interpret the language'' of the Constitution and the laws, ``notrecast it. ... That was, in the final analysis, his downfall.''   The Senate rejected Bork's nomination, 58-42, last Oct. 23.   ``Any fair reading of the record shows that I had an open mindand decided the issue on the merits,'' Specter said in respondingto Reynolds' remarks.   Warner responded by saying ``the nation has now turned itsfocus'' on how Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy ``willdischarge his responsibilities in light of the Senate's unanimousconfidence in him.''   Packwood's press secretary, Dan Witeck, said the ``vote has beentaken'' on the Bork nomination and that the senator would have nocomment on Reynolds' remarks.</TEXT></DOC>
