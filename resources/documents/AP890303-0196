Venezuela owes foreign creditors $33 billion. On Friday,President Bush announced he would provide the country with a $450million loan to help the struggling South American nation meet itsshort-term financial needs.   Perez told reporters that the four days of disturbances caused byprice increases could occur in other Latin American countries.   ``The crisis Latin American nations are undergoing has a namewritten with capital letters _ foreign debt,'' he said at a newsconference.   Perez also bitterly criticized industrialized nations for givinglittle or no help to support democratic governments.   Spain announced Friday it would send a $50 million loan to helpVenezuela recover from the rioting. The unrest was caused bygovernment-imposed bus fare increases, which appeared to releasepent-up frustration over its austerity program.   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidBush called Perez on Friday to express concern and support forPerez's ``courageous and determined efforts to address his country'seconomic and financial situation.''   Later, U.S. officials disclosed that Bush was making the $450million loan to help ease the financial crisis facing Perez'29-day-old government.   Perez confirmed that at least 300 people had been killed and2,000 injured since Monday. He put the number of arrests at ``barely1,000.''   Newspaper reports estimated the death toll at 300 to 400, andsaid more than 2,000 had been arrested in Caracas alone.   Martial law remained in effect Friday with a dusk-to-dawn curfewforcing stores to restrict opening hours. Soliers patrolled Caracason foot and in armored cars, and there was sporadic gunfire.   However, the capital of 4 million people appeared to be returningto normal. Buses and subways ran regularly and downtown streets werecrowded. Joggers were seen in parks early in the morning.   Long lines still formed outside grocery stores, but thegovernment set up distribution centers to relieve food shortages.   Perez linked the bloodiest civil unrest in Venezuela's history tothe burden of foreign debt and said it was jeopardizing a new waveof democracy sweeping Latin American.   He accused industrialized nations of inflexibility in demandingrepayment of the region's $420 billion foreign debt without regardto a nation's ability to pay.   ``I hope this painful sacrifice by our country will serve for theleaders of the industrial powers to reflect that we are notexaggerating when we say the crisis is serious,'' he said.   Perez said whether Venezuela can continue to make principal andinterest payments on its $33 billion foreign debt depends on thesuccess of his austerity program.   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Perez appearedto indicate that Venezuela had already suspended the debt payments.   However, a senior Venezuelan official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said later that ``there was an honest difference ofopinion over interpretation'' of Perez' remarks, and stressed thatVenezuela would continue to make the payments at least until the endof the month. Edgard A. Leal, the country's chief debt negotiator,also said Venezuela would continue to make payments.   Perez, who came to office just one month ago, was referring toeconomic austerity measures required under an agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund in exchange for a $4.3 billion loan overthe next three years.   Earlier this week, the government asked the InternationalMonetary Fund to include provisions allowing Venezuela to suspendall payments on its debt until September. Venezuela also asked foran additional $4.3 billion in loans from the institution in the nextthree years.   Venezuela's austerity program includes price increases for arange of basic goods and services, including bus fares, food,gasoline and electricity.   Venezuela is one of the few developing nations that has beenservicing foreign debt, Perez said, complaining that Western bankshad not recognized the effort by granting new loans.   Oil-producing Venezuela has for decades been one of thewealthiest and politically stable nations in Latin America. But acontinuing fall in world oil prices, combined with debt payments,has depleted monetary reserves, creating the economic crisis.   Real wages have since then fallen by a third since 1981, andinflation is expected to double this year to 70 percent.   Perez said Venezuela could expect six months of economichardship. But after that, he said, the economy will start to expand.   He said there was no immediate threat to Venezuelan stability,but warned that prolonged economic decline could ``undermine thefoundations of democracy.''</TEXT></DOC>
