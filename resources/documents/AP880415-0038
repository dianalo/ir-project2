Hundreds of Arabs formed a human wall around the dusty hilltopsite Thursday after the Israeli military government ordered themosque torn down because it was being erected without a permit.   ``If the bulldozers arrive, they will have to bury us inside themosque,'' Seif Khatib, 50, said as he and hundreds of othervillagers surrounded the half-finished limestone building.   Villagers claimed the permit was withheld to punish them fortaking part in the 18-week anti-Israeli uprising and for refusingto accept Israeli-appointed leadership.   Since Dec. 8, at least 146 Palestinians, an Israeli soldier anda 15-year-old Jewish settler have been killed in riots in theoccupied territories.   But Israeli officials said they want to halt constructionbecause the new mosque, an annex to a 61-year-old mosque, was builtover archaeological ruins that may help identify Anata as thebirthplace of a biblical prophet.   The military government approved a four-day reprieve hoursbefore the scheduled demolition Thursday, but the dispute hasproduced strong anti-Israeli sentiment among villagers.   ``The Israelis don't want more mosques. They are afraid it willhelp the Islamic movement. And because of the uprising, they wantto take revenge against us,'' said Khatib, wearing a white prayercap and a gray pin-striped robe.   Minutes later, an army jeep pulled up the hill, and shouts of``The soldiers are coming!'' swept through the crowd. Villageelders in white Arab headdresses restrained hot-headed youthspushing toward the jeep, telling them not to provoke the soldiers.   A lieutenant colonel climbed out of the jeep and toured themosque with village elders. The officer told residents that theyhad won a reprieve until Monday, when the military government is tomeet with Anata residents.   Olivier Rafovitch, a spokesman for the military government,indicated the demolition order might be canceled to avoid a violentconfrontation.   ``We know religous matters are very sensitive and we are goingto work out a solution,'' Rafovitch said.   He said a construction permit was denied because the mosque wasbeing built on ruins from the Byzantine, Roman, Hellenistic periodsand even the Iron Age.   One of the mosque's outer walls is a yard away from the rooflessruins of a Byzantine church.   Avram Biran, an archaeologist who has excavated sites in nearbyvillages, said remains underneath the church might provide clues asto whether Anata, called Anathoth (City of Refuge) in the Bible,was the birthplace of the prophet Jeremiah.   He noted that Anata, just northeast of Jerusalem, has beendeclared an historical site, and that all building was strictlyregulated.   But villagers claimed the military government was trying topunish them for refusing to accept Israel-appointed village leaders.   Construction of the mosque began about two months ago to providemore space for worshipers who have been forced to pray in thestreets surrounding the old mosque.   Residents have donated material and about 200 villagers laboredat the site in their spare time.   ``This is our mosque and I worked hard,'' said 15-year-oldMoussa Abd Saleh, who helped carry bricks and mix cement.   ``It is a gift to God,'' added Khatib. ``This land should beexempt from regulations.''</TEXT></DOC>
