(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A major manufacturer of helicopters saidit is looking into building a commuter helicopter that could carryup to 100 passengers.   Officials at Sikorsky Aircraft, based here, said they have beenactively studying the feasibility of such a helicopter, which theycall a VLCT for ``very large civil transport,'' for the past year.   Such a jumbo helicopter could offer a solution to the problem ofhighway traffic jams and airport congestion, Sikorsky officials said.   ``The effort began in earnest last year as a continuation ofresearch of the past 20 years,'' said Robert Kelly, director ofcommercial marketing, in remarks prepared for release Sunday at ahelicopter trade show in New Orleans.   ``We are producing military helicopters today that can easilytransport 20,000 pounds at good speeds over long stage lengths,''Kelly said. ``That could equate to 100 passengers and lots ofreserves, if that should turn out to be the optimum.''   Using existing technology, such a helicopter could be introducedby the turn of the century, Kelly said. Sikorsky officials envisiona helicopter that would carry 75 to 100 people on short- tomedium-range trips at about 150 mph.   Sikorsky said it is does not intend to introduce such a craftbefore the year 2000, to allow time for refinements of equipment andfor cities and states to construct suitable heliports.   Sikorsky noted that the Federal Aviation Administration hasestimated that airport congestion will become a critical problemnationwide by the year 2000. Similar projections also have been madefor Europe and Japan.   Sikorsky, primarily a defense contractor, is a leadingmanufacturer of military helicopters, including the Black Hawk andthe Seahawk, which are produced for the U.S. Navy and the RoyalAustralian Air Force.</TEXT></DOC>
