Gregory Gajewski of the department's Economic Research Servicesaid U.S. farmers have millions of idled acres that could bebrought quickly back into production if prospects brighten.   ``Other countries also have the potential to expand agriculturalproduction,'' he said. ``Canada, the EC (European Community),Brazil, Argentina, Thailand and others could substantially boostoutput if producer prices rose enough.''   In the United States, land used to grow U.S. crops this year isestimated at 342 million acres, up 14 million acres from 1988,Gajewski writes in the November issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine.   Slightly more than 29 million acres were idled this year underthe USDA's annual crop programs. That does not count around 30million acres of ``highly erodible'' cropland held out ofproduction under the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.   ``Should crop supplies tighten further and prices rise, theacreage idled under the annual programs could quickly return toproduction,'' Gajewski said.   But at the moment, the need for a large crop production increase``is in some doubt,'' he added.   Wheat exports continue to be subsidized by both the UnitedStates and the 12-nation EEC. And prices of soybeans and ``coarse''grains _ corn, sorghum, oats and barley _ have come down fromearlier high levels.   ``Moreover, such a surge in worldwide production could come atsome environmental cost,'' Gajewski said. ``But the higher pricesand profits would help farmers absorb the costs of shifting to moreenvironmentally sustainable farming practices.''   Gajewski said the experience of U.S. farmers in the 1970s andearly 1980s ``may temper plans for expansion'' in the near future.   It was a combination of declining supplies and rising commodityprices that triggered larger production and a rise in globalstockpiles of grain.   ``But world production growth outpaced demand growth in theearly and mid-1980s, and stagnating prices touched off the farmfinancial crisis,'' he said. ``Land values plummeted as farmers'returns did not keep up with earlier expectations.''   Gajewski said that a few years ago ``U.S. grain surpluses wereso big that much effort went into devising new ways to store it.''Now, some analysts are worried about the low levels of foodreserves.   Farm income has risen dramatically from the ebb of the early'80s. After allowing for inflation, 1989 income is expected to beup about 35 percent from 1984, ``when farmers were strugglingthrough their worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,''he said.   Land values have been rising the last couple of years, althoughGajewski noted new survey information showing that farmland pricesare expected to rise much more slowly in 1990.   Because land values embody profits expected for the next decade,Gajewski said the recent slowing could reflect concerns aboutlong-term trends in commodity prices, new farm legislation due in1990, negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, and future policies under the 1992 European unity plan.   But he added, ``On a more basic level, the slowing likelyreflects farmers' more cautious attitudes following the financialcrisis'' earlier this decade.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A proposal by President Bush to overhaulfederal pesticide regulations, including faster action to takechemicals off the market, has drawn generally favorable reactionfrom major farm and commodity organizations.   The president said Thursday that the plan was partly in responseto public's concern over stories ``alleging the presence ofdangerous levels of pesticides.''   While claiming the nation's food supply to be safe, he said``some of the public's perception is based on valid concerns aboutthe government's slow and cumbersome process for removingpesticides from the market.''   Bush mentioned a high degree of awareness by Americans of newsstories earlier this year on the presence of the cancer-causingchemical Alar on some apples; and, more recently, concern about thewidespread use of the fungicide EBDC on fruits and vegetables.   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,paid tribute to a provision in Bush's plan that would impose a``negligible risk'' standard on pesticides.   Some had advocated a ``zero tolerance'' standard, which wouldban all traces of suspected chemicals in food.   ``Those who favor `zero tolerance' and farmers disarmingthemselves and surrendering to all pests probably won't be happywith this,'' Kleckner said. ``But they wouldn't be happy with thedisruptions in the food supply and distribution system that wouldresult from such policies, either.''   Five major commodity organizations said in a joint statementthat they supported Bush's effort as a commitment ``to buildingconsumer confidence in our food supply, which is already the safestfood supply in the world.''   The statement was issued by the American Soybean Association,National Association of Wheat Growers, National Corn GrowersAssociation, National Cotton Council, and U.S. Rice ProducersLegislative Group.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Carol L. Levy, a special agent in theAgriculture Department, has been recognized as this year'soutstanding woman in federal law enforcement.

The award is namedin honor of a U.S. Secret Service agency killed in the line of duty.   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Levy, who works forthe department's Office of Inspector General in Hyattsville, Md.,has ``exhibited great resourcefulness, demonstrated strongleadership qualities and sound decision-making'' in her career.   Levy, 35, was born in Evergreen Park, Ill., and began with theagency in 1976 as an investigator in the Chicago regional officeafter graduating from the University of Illinois at Chicago with adegree in criminal justice and psychology.
