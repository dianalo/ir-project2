Robins Co. shareholders won a seven-day extension in its scramble to pull together a plan to compete against the pending takeover bid of French drug maker Sanofi S.A.    U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige Jr. ruled yesterday that Robins must wait until Jan. 21 for a court hearing on its motion seeking authority to sign the Sanofi agreement and nullify its prior pact with Rorer Group Inc.    The hearing had been scheduled for Thursday.    A committee representing Dalkon Shield claimants in Robins's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law case sought the extension, and the shareholders committee supported the delay.    &quot;We think it's more important that the bidding process be done correctly than that it be done by a certain date,&quot; said Wilbur Ross Jr., a member of the shareholders committee.    The delay could work to the advantage of the shareholders group, but it doesn't appear to help the Robins board or Paris-based Sanofi, which is 60% owned by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company. Moreover, the shareholders committee could seek to wrest from Robins the exclusive right to present a reorganization plan to the court.    The Richmond, Va.-based health products maker has had that exclusive right since it filed for Chapter 11 protection in August 1985. But under bankruptcy law, the exclusivity could be forfeited if, for example, the committee can show its efforts have produced a superior offer.    While operating under Chapter 11, a company is protected from its creditors while it works out a plan of reorganization.    Some people familiar with the negotiations believe the shareholders committee may use the extra time to assemble a &quot;package&quot; bid for Robins. Such a proposal, they say, could involve participation by as many as three or four companies and could be valued in the range of $6 billion.    &quot;There seem to be a lot of people out there who are interested in various pieces of Robins,&quot; said a negotiator for one of the current bidders.    After the court granted the extension, committee members were guarded about their plans. &quot;The situation is very fluid,&quot; said a committee representative. &quot;We're looking at every mechanism for improving the bids. I wouldn't rule anything out.&quot;    For more than a week, the shareholders committee has been holding private, separate talks with Rorer, American Home Products Corp. and other interested parties, trying to develop sweetened bids and then choose one of them to endorse. The committee has said it wouldn't back Robins's agreement to become a subsidiary of Sanofi unless the French concern provides a way to improve short-term value to shareholders.    Other negotiators speculate that the committee's ultimate objective may be to push Sanofi to sweeten further the equity portion of its offer. Sanofi's current proposal includes a payment of $600 million for convertible securities that would give Sanofi a 58% stake.    In the meantime, Rorer and American Home Products Corp. seem somewhat fatigued and frustrated by the protracted process, but neither show any inclination to drop their pursuit of Robins.    &quot;We're in an extra-innings ball game here,&quot; said a spokesman for American Home. &quot;We'd like to see this thing wrapped up sooner rather than later.&quot;    Added John Bartlett, Rorer's general counsel: &quot;We are here to see this thing through to whatever the conclusion will be.&quot;    For Rorer, that outcome could be litigation. Yesterday, Judge Merhige granted authority to the Fort Washington, Pa.-based health products maker to collect depositions from several Robins officials and outside advisers who participated in the negotiations with Sanofi and other bidders. Robins sought unsuccessfully to quash Rorer's request.    According to people familiar with the request, Rorer seeks to determine, among other things, whether Robins's negotiators breached the Robins-Rorer merger agreement signed in August by selectively leaking information to Sanofi last month when a new round of bidding was triggered. Robins denies showing any favoritism toward Sanofi.    &quot;The Rorer people certainly aren't walking away,&quot; said an attorney involved in the Chapter 11 case. &quot;They're lining up to litigate, and it looks as if they are prepared to fight hard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
