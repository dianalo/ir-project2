Not so long ago only a few people spoke publicly about the need for change. Today everyone speaks about change, and the nation's leaders more insistently than others. . . .    It would seem that those people who had already spoken and written the truth about life in their society, despite the prohibitions and repressions, would find it easier to become part of this process. It would seem that all they had to do was to continue their cause, but it is not so simple, because they must take into consideration not only their actions, but also the counteractions. It is no secret that the policy of change encounters active resistance from those in the political and economic apparatus who have brought the nation, directly or indirectly, to this &quot;pre-crisis situation.&quot; Until now these individuals have continued to occupy numerous key positions, and they actively stand in the way of restructuring. Their major argument is the fear of losing control over the nation. These forces should not be underestimated.    We are aware of the fact that one can impede the budding restructuring process not only by actively resisting the reforms, but also by prompting actions on behalf of their opponents. It is not easy in today's complicated political situation either to support with confidence or to reject outright any evaluation. We are aware of the danger of acting, but inaction is also intolerable. . . .    The first steps are clear. We begin by publishing the Information Bulletin Glasnost and a larger publication, the Anthology Glasnost, which will contain articles and materials on important contemporary problems. Both publications are independent organs with the purpose of facilitating democratic consciousness in society. . . .    Both publications are intended as totally legitimate publications, registered with the appropriate state organizations. The Bulletin and the Anthology will highlight to the same degree aspects of the human-rights movement in the country as well as other socially significant problems, such as ecology, culture, economics, and social life, while bringing together in these publications a broad circle of highly qualified specialists.    The need for independent publications is dictated by the fact that the entire print media in our country are part of that very political, administrative, or economic apparatus which is far from irreproachable and has recently been subjected to open criticism. In our country the mass media are a part of this apparatus, and therefore do not perform the function of feedback between society and the leadership very well. . . .    There is another important aspect: all changes in our country are perceived with great interest by the entire world, and information provided by independent publications will be received with greater trust and will increase the degree of trust between nations.    And finally: A large part of the country's population is biased against official publications. Now these people will see that a publication which is checked by {the government} but is still independent is possible in our country. This will be serious evidence of the fact that democratization is beginning to take place and will enliven the spiritual climate of our society more than dozens and hundreds of declarations.    Today we have only one means of encouraging change in the nation -- to embody these changes in the word and in the social consciousness, and to make them objective. Truth is in the domain of society, and what was a secret yesterday is being discussed today openly and everywhere. It is impossible to remain silent.
