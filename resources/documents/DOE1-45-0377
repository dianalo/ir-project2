Whilethe discipline of systems engineering is well documented, there are variousapproaches to the discipline appropriate in particular applications.This paper discusses the unique features of the waste management problemand the application of systems engineering to meet the requirements ofthese features. It must be recognized that the program is in a very earlystage and that improvements to both the system and the systems engineeringprocess will naturally emerge.</TEXT></DOC>
