The address by Bundestag President Philipp Jenninger promptedcharges that some Germans have not honestly faced up to whatoccurred under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, including theextermination of 6 million Jews.   ``The background of what happened is the inability of manyGermans to stand up to their own past,'' the leftist Greens partysaid before Jenniger, a conservative Christian Democrat, resignedFriday.   In his speech Thursday marking the 50th anniversary ofKristallnacht when Nazi thugs attacked Jews, Jenninger attempted toset the scene of Germany in the 1930s when Hitler came to power,saying Germans initially found the Nazi era ``glorious.''   Jenninger says the speech was misunderstood and that he is an``uncompromising foe of every type of totalitarian rule.''   Both West Germany and communist East Germany devoted themselvesthis week to decrying Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, of Nov. 9-10,1938, the prelude to the Holocaust. The night was named for theshards of glass that littered streets after Nazis smashed and burnedJewish business, homes and synagogues.   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker has insistedGermans bore full responsiblity for the Nazi era and warned againstany attempts to play down its horrors.   ``Nothing that historical science brings to light today candiminish the crimes of the Nazi era,'' Weizsaecker said last month.   The East German government has also denounced the Nazi years butrejects responsibility for Nazi crimes, they say, because the crimesoccurred before the 1949 founding of the communist country. WestGermany was founded the same year.   For all their well-intentioned effort, the remembrances ofKristallnacht this week went awry with Jenninger's speech.   Jenninger recalled that many Germans in the 1930s at first feltHitler brought them ``glorious times.''   His address ignited a storm of protest _ at home and abroad.   Politicians across the political spectrum called for Jenninger toresign.   Angry responses came from Israel and from Jewish leaders in theUnited States.   East Germany's official news agency ADN called the Jenningerspeech ``a scandal.''   Newspapers reported Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a close friend ofJenninger, called him to the office to criticize him for theemotionless tone of the speech.   The leftist Greens said Jenninger's speech showed that despitethe passage of 43 years, many West Germans still have notsufficiently come to grips with what happened under Hitler's rule.   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democrats, said,``This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German history isstill a present-day thing.''   In New York, Morris Abram, chairman of the Conference ofPresidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said: ``SpeakerJenninger, regardless of his intentions, was guilty of insensitivityto that which can never be forgotten or forgiven.''   But many observers rushed to his side, pointing to Jenninger'srecord as a steadfast supporter of Israel. Also, no one questionedhis assertions that he is anti-Nazi.   The conservative daily newspaper Die Welt in today's editionssaid Jenninger's main error was the tone of his speech could havegiven the impression he had ``found a way to understand thedevelopments of 50 years ago'' without balancing that againstharsher criticism of the Nazi era.   The controversy is likely to keep West Germans thinking about howbest to deal with recollections of the Nazi years, the newspapersaid.   ``The reasons for the fast plummet of the second-ranking officialin our country will be occupying us for a long time,'' Die Welt said.   A leader of West Germany's Jewish community Thursday defendedJenninger's speech.   ``I welcome that the Parliament president described in fullclarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,'' saidMichael Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews inWest Germany.   ``Especially the fact that everything that Hitler did wasstrongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' Fuerst said.   But Friday, Jewish council chairman Heinz Galinski was quoted asdisavowing his deputy's comments.   ``No one is supporting him. That's shown by the numerous proteststhat have reached me from all Jewish communities,'' the Neue Presseof Hanover quoted Galinski as saying.   The newspaper also quoted Galinski as saying Fuerst might losehis job.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR`S NOTE _ Terrence Petty, a newsman in the Frankfurt bureauof The Associated Press, has been reporting on German issues since1987.</TEXT></DOC>
