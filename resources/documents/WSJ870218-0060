But it is already being greeted with a big yawn.    The broad outlines are expected to be agreed upon this week, perhaps as early as today, when the newly elected government's coalition partners conclude negotiations on tax policy. But instead of the sweeping change that many economists say is needed, the coalition has adopted measures that pale in comparison to the recent tax overhaul in the U.S.    Economists argue that the current tax system stifles incentive and therefore the entire economy. Businesses pay a top corporate rate of 56%, one of the world's highest. German companies also are subject to a confusing hodgepodge of local taxes that, taken together, can bring a company's effective tax rate to more than 70%. The tax rate for individuals ranges from 22% at the low-income end to 56% at the high end.    The coalition is expected to agree to a one-time tax cut of about $22 billion, the biggest in German history, to take effect in 1989. Specifics of the accord will be worked out later, but the tax package appears to provide little relief to either businesses or high-income wage earners. It's likely that each will continue to pay the 56% top rate. And part of the $22 billion in lost revenue will be offset with additional taxes on cigarettes and other consumer items.    &quot;I'm deeply disappointed,&quot; says Dieter Lau of the Alliance of German Taxpayers, who sat in on the coalition talks. &quot;We had an opportunity to reform the system and we failed.&quot;    Also disappointed are U.S. officials, who have been calling for substantially stronger measures to stimulate growth, allowing Germany to import more and help alleviate the U.S. trade deficit.    As modest as the measures are, even they won't be adopted without a struggle. The tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies. Such reductions could rile special-interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program. Moreover, any tax reform must clear parliament's upper house, the Bundesrat, where the ruling Christian Democratic Union clings to a majority.    Many political analysts attribute the failure to overhaul the tax structure as typical of Germany's glacial pace of problem solving. Leaders &quot;all lack the courage to really tackle the problem,&quot; says Armin Gutowski, a German economist who advocates bolder tax cuts, even at the risk of higher budget deficits.    While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about $22 billion, they differ on who should benefit. The Social Democrats and the left-wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class. Within the ruling coalition, the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats, the Christian Socialists, want cuts spread across the board.    The Christian Democrats themselves are split over which income groups should benefit most. The party's &quot;social wing,&quot; which has resisted cutting the peak rate, calls instead for more income exemptions, such as for children.    A more forceful chancellor might have united the factions within the coalition. But &quot;there is no leadership on the issue,&quot; complains Horst Vogel, a tax expert in Bonn.    Partly because of West Germans' high standard of living, most are apathetic about tax reform. Most Germans hardly noticed last year's more-modest $6 billion in tax relief because it was offset by increases in social security contributions.    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has repeatedly tied tax cuts to reducing the deficit and balancing the budget. That attitude reflects the fiscal conservatism of Germany at large. Tax reform is largely distrusted because it adds to government deficits, which are feared as inflationary.    &quot;The whole attitude toward tax cutting is different than in the United States,&quot; says Alfred Boss, an economist at the Institute for World Economics in Kiel. &quot;Hardly anyone looks at the economic stimulus of cutting taxes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
