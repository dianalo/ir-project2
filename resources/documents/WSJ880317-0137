The company said its troubled unit probably will default on $3.7 million of interest due April 15 on a third debenture issue. Clabir added that the parent company, as expected, is in default under a $57 million credit agreement with its principal banks. The company has borrowed $55 million under the agreement, which expires March 31.    Clabir, whose odd mix of businesses includes making military ammunition and Klondike ice-cream bars, said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to advise on the proposed sale and possible restructuring of the publicly held debt of General Defense and of Hamilton Technology Inc., a General Defense unit.    In the early 1980s Clabir spun off most of General Defense in several transactions, then paid $120 million in 1986 to reacquire the 77% stake it didn't own. General Defense, a maker of ammunition for military weapons, has been hurt by cost overruns, parts-delivery delays and a decline in orders.    Results for the year ended Jan. 31 aren't completed, but Clabir said it expects General Defense to report a big operating loss on revenue of about $159 million, a 42% drop from revenue of $275.9 million a year earlier, when the unit posted an operating profit of $31.4 million.    General Defense missed the Feb. 1 interest payment on $30 million of 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due 2003. Hamilton defaulted on $5 million of interest payments due Feb. 1 on $80.5 million of 12 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due 1999. As reported last month, Clabir had said that the defaults were anticipated.    Yesterday it said that General Defense probably will default on $3.7 million of interest due April 15 on $57.5 million of 13% senior subordinated debentures due 1995.    Clabir shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $2.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
