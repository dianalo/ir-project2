In typically light Monday trading, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.23 to 384.48. It was the index's biggest fall in four weeks, and largely wiped out the gains from last week's end-of-the-quarter buying.    The biggest decliner: Home Office Reference Laboratory, which plunged 4 1/4 to 10 3/4, a 28% fall, on a Nasdaq-leading 2.7 million shares. The laboratory-testing company said late Friday that it expects to report third-quarter earnings of about 28 cents a share, sharply lower than analysts' current estimates of 40 cents a share.    Partly because the OTC market often fails to catch up with last-minute Wall Street recoveries such as yesterday's, OTC indexes lagged those of the New York Stock Exchange. The composite fell 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 index of the market's major stocks, including such decliners as MCI Communications, Intel, Micron Technology and Lotus Development, tumbled 5.16 to 353.57, or 1.4%. In comparison, the New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped only 0.22% and the Dow Jones industrials only 0.36%.    It was a different story for the first three quarters. The Nasdaq composite was up 17.3%, ahead of the Big Board composite at 11.1% and the Dow Jones industrials at 9%. Much of the Nasdaq gain was attributable to a strong first-quarter rally.    Christine Callies, who writes a regular OTC Counter Action report for Dean Witter Reynolds, said the Nasdaq market has been mired in a &quot;rotational correction&quot; since March -- in which downturns have occurred in technology, electronics and selected industrial stocks and then in building materials, machinery, services and lately genetic research, retailers, apparel and precious metals.    Nasdaq's recent intraday rallies, Ms. Callies added, haven't been encouraging. &quot;So far these rallies have been the product of selective strength in blue-chip type stocks and (takeover) deals, and little else,&quot; said Ms. Callies.    For example, Travelers Real Estate Investment Trust rose 7/8 to 7 3/8 after BRT Realty Trust, of Great Neck, N.Y., said it might make a takeover offer.    Among the market's most active stocks, Alco Health Services declined 1 to 24 after reports that the Federal Trade Commission will seek a preliminary injunction to block McKesson Corp.'s proposed $30-a-share tender offer.    FileNet plunged 2 3/8 to 7 1/8 in active trading after the company, which sells a system that converts paper documents to computer images, said it expects to report that revenue for the third quarter was about $12.5 million. The company estimated it will report a net loss of $2.3 million. The numbers were below the company's and analysts' expectations.    Ted Smith, FileNet president and chief executive officer, said: &quot;We believe the entry of IBM into the marketplace combined with a number of prospects experiencing unexpected administrative delays in their approval cycles had the impact of lengthening the normal sales cycle.&quot; He said FileNet is cutting expenses to return to profitability.    Overall declining Nasdaq issues outpaced advancers 1,286 to 681. </TEXT></DOC>
