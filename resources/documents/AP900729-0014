The Berliner Morgenpost, a West Berlin newspaper, said thesoldiers' appearances at autobahn rest stops were the result ofdrastic price rises in East Germany following the July 1 economicmerger of the two Germanys.   Prices also rose at Red Army commissaries, the newspaper said.   Quoting unidentified travelers, Morgenpost cited one instancewhere two Soviet soldiers, wearing dusty, unkempt uniforms,approached parked cars asking if the drivers could give themsomething to eat or drink.   To make the event less embarrassing, the newspaper said, onesoldier had a 1-mark piece in his hand to offer as payment.   Requests have ranged from bread and other types of food tochocolate, cigarettes, soft drinks and beer, the newspaper said,adding that more and more drivers were reporting such encounters.   One driver from Potsdam, at a rest stop near East Berlin, calledthe soldiers ``really poor devils who acted like slaves.''</TEXT></DOC>
