Since then, the younger Milken has frequently been in the shadow of his sibling, who as the head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield-bond operation has become one of the best-known and richest men in American business.    Yet 38-year-old Lowell, also a Drexel executive, is described by close associates as extremely influential in the high-yield operation here. He also oversees much of the brothers' vast and complex personal financial empire, according to sources and documents. &quot;Mike is the analyst and salesman while Lowell is the legal, business and detail guy. It is very much a complementary relationship,&quot; says one source who has worked closely with the two.    Now Lowell is attracting attention as part of the ongoing federal probe into insider trading. As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the ties between Drexel's &quot;junk bond&quot; operation and arbitrager Ivan Boesky, who has pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges.    Sources said the SEC is seeking information regarding transactions between Mr. Boesky and the Milken brothers. Part of that inquiry is believed to be looking into some of the Milkens' personal investment activities, which are often entwined in transactions by Drexel. No allegations of wrongdoing against the Milken brothers have been made.    Like his better-known brother, Lowell assiduously avoids the spotlight and declined to be interviewed for this story.    After college, the two brothers' paths diverged. Michael went to the Wharton business school in Philadelphia and on to Drexel's operations in New York.    Lowell got his law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he made law review and a strong impression on one of his fellow students. &quot;Lowell is like a dynamo. He is driving all the time,&quot; says Peter Dekom, a top entertainment industry attorney and longtime friend of Lowell's.    Several associates say they would be surprised if either of the Milkens was involved in any insider-trading violations. &quot;I've been with Lowell on many occasions where he was very sensitive to the confidentiality of information,&quot; says one longtime friend.    Upon graduation in 1973, Lowell joined the Los Angeles law firm of Irell andamp; Manella and specialized in tax law. However, friends say he became increasingly involved in a burgeoning portfolio of investments with his brother. &quot;They were already very active in investing in low-grade bonds,&quot; says Mr. Dekom. He jokes that it got to the point that Lowell's &quot;biggest client was himself.&quot;    In 1978, Lowell joined Drexel, the same year his brother moved the high-yield-bond operation here from New York. One friend says he was surprised the move didn't occur earlier given the closeness of the brothers. &quot;Lowell is extremely family oriented,&quot; he says. Lowell is married with three children.    A Drexel spokesman says Lowell is a senior vice president in the high-yield-bond operation, a title held by a number of Drexel executives. His duties include lending his legal expertise to various Drexel transactions as well as handling some of the administrative and research work of the bond operation. &quot;His duties are very broad-based,&quot; the spokesman says.    Equally or more important, sources say, is Lowell's role in supervising the myriad of private partnerships and other investment vehicles for the brothers and key Drexel employees. Lowell is the &quot;point man in trying to pull together the capital&quot; for the partnerships, says one associate.    &quot;They've created a lot of loyalty with the partnerships. People get their money tied up,&quot; adds one major Drexel junk-bond customer. This customer adds that Drexel officials have told him they are accustomed to investment returns on the order of 100% annually from the partnerships.    By some estimates there are dozens of these partnerships. Public records in Los Angeles alone disclose that 22 such investment vehicles have been set up in recent years involving the Milkens.    The investments have ranged from pieces of California real estate, including Drexel's building here, to an unsuccessful venture to produce animated children's movies for television. The Milkens and other Drexel executives have also invested in the securities issued by Drexel clients.    Indeed, the Milkens' belief in high-yield securities even carries over into their rapidly growing charitable efforts. The Milken Family Foundation, a charity that lists Lowell as president and Michael as secretary-treasurer, has invested heavily in the high-yield securities underwritten by Drexel. As of Nov. 30, 1985, the most recent year for which data are available, records show that the bulk of the foundation's $43.8 million in assets consisted of securities issued by Drexel clients such as Metromedia Inc.'s broadcasting unit and Pantry Pride Inc.    Besides holding bonds, the foundation also did short-term trading in the issues of Drexel clients. For instance, the foundation on July 12, 1985, bought $4 million of Pantry Pride bonds that were part of a $700 million offering handled by Drexel. The foundation sold the bonds a month later for the same price.    Another short-term trade involved bonds that foundation records show were connected with Mr. Boesky. The foundation bought $8 million of the bonds at the end of August 1985 and sold them in mid-October at a $10,000 profit.    For the year ended Nov. 30, 1985, the foundation reported capital gains of about $3.4 million. In that year, the foundation's holdings leaped from $5.5 million to nearly $44 million, thanks largely to some $30 million in contributions by Michael Milken.    The Drexel spokesman said that about a year ago, the brothers turned management of the foundation's portfolio over to a professional investment adviser.    The foundation's 1985 donations totaled $560,000 and went to a variety of charities and educational institutions, including Berkeley and Wharton. It also gave $50,000 to the Armand Hammer United World College. The college was founded by Dr. Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Co., a Drexel client. </TEXT></DOC>
