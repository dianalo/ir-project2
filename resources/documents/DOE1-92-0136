Experiments were conductedat 1 kbar and 2 kbar, between 240{sup 0}C and 620{sup 0}C, and from X/subCO2/ = .02 to X/sub CO2/ = .15 in order to determine the solubility behavioras a function of pressure, temperature, and CO{sub 2} content. The resultsindicate that calcite solubilities under these conditions behave similarlyto previously investigated calcite solubilities at lower pressures andtemperature. At constant X/sub CO2/, the solubility increases with increasingpressure, but it decreases with increasing temperature. When the temperatureand pressure are constant, the calcite solubility rises with increasingX/sub CO2/ to a maximum value at X/sub CO2/ between 0.2 and 0.05. Forhigher CO{sub 2} contents, up to X/sub CO{sub 2}/ = .15, the calcitesolubility decreases, probably due to the decrease of H{sub 2}O activitiesto values significantly below unity. The solubility behavior can be successfullymodeled by making the assumption that Ca{sup ++} is the dominant calciumspecies and that the carbon-bearing species are CO/sub 2(aq)/ and HCO{sub3}{sup -}. These calculated values are in good agreement with the lowtemperature determinations of the ionization constants for this reactiondetermined by READ (1975). Values of the molal Gibbs free energy of CO/sub2(aq)/ obtained in the authors exhibit a much greater positive departurefrom ideality than those calculated with the modified Redlich-Kwong equationsof either FLOWERS (1979) or KERRICK and JACOBS (1981) for dilute CO{sub2} aqueous solutions.</TEXT></DOC>
