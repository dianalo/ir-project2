There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, thewell-used park benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men workon the black-and-white tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart throughhonking, fume-spewing traffic. The people look sturdy, and notparticularly fashion-minded.   This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on thesouthwestern fringe of Europe, has to go to achieve its goal ofcatching up with its neighbors. Now an overheating economy isfurther imperiling that ambition.   A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the smallcountry's ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992.That's when the 12-nation European Community, which Portugal joinedin 1986, becomes one barrier-free marketplace of 320 millionconsumers.   In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attentioneastward to the rest of Europe after hundreds of years of lookingacross the Atlantic and into Africa and India.   The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman andMoorish conquerors, perhaps have come to terms with the loss of theglobe-circling empire that their famous explorers discovered fivecenturies ago.   Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxedmingling of black, brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in thecurry in Portuguese food, in the easy command of English in thisPortuguese-speaking country.   After painful recession, austerity and more than 25 percentinflation in 1983 and 1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamiceconomies. Gross domestic product has grown 4.5 percent a year onaverage for three years, and is projected to continue at 3.5percent. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6 percent.   A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debtto $16 billion, down from 80.4 percent of GDP in 1985 to 40.7percent.   But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcingunpopular measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva'scenter-right Social Democrats, who won an unprecedented majority inparliament in the June 1987 general election, have lost support inrecent months.   A poll recently published in O Jornal showed that the SocialDemocrats down to 41 percent nearly halfway through their four-yearterm from just under 50 percent in the election. The clean-cut,49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation for beingabrasive and overly self-confident.   The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36 percentfrom 22.3 percent, and Socialist President Mario Soares, alegendary, consummate politician, has become increasingly popular.   Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the firstPortuguese leader to survive a full four-year term since the 1974Revolution of the Carnations which ended 48 years of authoritarianrule, mostly under rightist dictator Antonio Salazar.   ``We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficientand competitive economy, a more creative and enterprising society, afreer, more modern country, without being perturbed by those whowould like Portugal to turn back to the past,'' the prime ministersaid in a recent speech.   The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workerswho are resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulpprocessing, fearing these will replace traditional olive trees andthreaten farm jobs.   The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March when localpeople trying to dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed withnational guardsmen.   In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.   Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of PortugueseIndustry, said, ``Now people tend to criticize the government a lotand the mood is a very critical one.''   Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo,``I think we have a certain situation of crisis.''   You hear it on the streets.   Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ``Many peopleare unhappy because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. Thecost of living is very hard.''   But not everybody is negative.   Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ``Thereare more jobs. There is less poverty in particular than in the otherdays.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
