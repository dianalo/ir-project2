Investing in the rising generation is long-range planning at itsbest.   Our future in this technological age depends upon the qualitiesand capabilities of the American worker _ and not just the mosttalented among us, but each individual member of the work force.   The seven-point program of education reform I sent to Congressearly this month will help us reward excellence, reach out tostudents most in need, increase choice, and introduce a healthyelement of competition and accountability that will promote qualityin our schools.   Preparing for the kinder, gentler future I've spoken of meanshelping Americans cope with the changing nature of society _helping fundamental institutions like the family remain strong andprosper.   That's the guiding aim of my child care intitatives, a taxcredit proposal designed to expand the options of low-incomefamilies _ keeping the ultimate choice of who will care for theirchildren in their hands.   Preparing for the future means protecting our environment.   Teddy Roosevelt put it best when he said: ``I do not recognizethe right ... to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that comeafter us.''   Roosevelt spoke those words almost 80 years ago.   Now, little more than a decade away from the 21st century,safeguarding our environment is a national _ and international _imperative.   We've taken the first, important steps: we've urged Congress toenact legislation enabling us to ban export of hazardous wastes tonations where safe handling of those dangerous substances cannot beguaranteed.   And in response to growing concern about global warming, theU.S. will work in concert with other nations to end the dischargeof CFCs into the atmosphere by the year 2000.   And in the case of the Alaskan oil spill, we have taken steps toensure a strong federal role in oversight of the cleanup effort,and to explore ways to prevent such spills in the future.   Finally, we have launched an initiative to strengthen theinternational strategy on Third World debt, which has alreadyreceived broad international support from both industrialized anddeveloping countries.   We have set our course with this policy; now I want to seesuccess on a case by case basis.   I want to see an agreement with Mexico, with Venezuela, and withother countries as well.   We have examined and I have made decisions on U.S. strategy forAfghanistan, Poland, Central America and other problems andopportunities needing prompt attention.   Within a few weeks nearly all of the far-reaching and systematicdefense and foreign policy reviews will be complete.   I have already made some decisions.   Others, including on arms control, will be forthcoming soon.   We are mapping strategies for a period of remarkable change ininternational affairs _ change more wide-ranging and rapid than atany time in the postwar period.   While we will lead, we also intend to consult and listen _ toour friends abroad and to the Congress.   I've met with the leaders of 34 nations _ renewing myacquaintance with many of them, establishing a working relationshipwith the others.   My secretary of state, Jim Baker, has met with Soviet ForeignMinister Shevardnadze, and will meet again next month in Moscow tocontinue that dialogue.   And, as with the bipartisan agreement on Nicaragua, I will workclosely on international matters with the Congress.   Last Monday, we announced a new policy towards Poland, inrecognition of the positive changes taking place there.   We'll be watching events in Poland closely: the fate ofSolidarity, the follow-through on the free elections promised bythe Polish government.   Freedom is proving a powerful force in world affairs _ a forcefor peace and stability.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
