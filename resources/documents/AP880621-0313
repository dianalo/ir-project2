A second target of the probe appears on the verge ofcooperating, said the source, who demanded anonymity.   It could not be determined whether the target who is cooperatingis a Pentagon employee, a consultant or a defense contractor.   Sources familiar with the probe also said that one wiretapinvolves a conversation between former Navy Secretary John LehmanJr. and his then-aide Melvyn Paisley.   The sources said that conversation, recorded late last year orearly this year, can be interpreted as being a tip-off by Lehmanthat Paisley might be under investigation.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III refused to say Monday whetherLehman is among those under scrutiny. Paisley and another formerLehman aide, retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons, have beenimplicated.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused todescribe the possible warning, which investigators are examining asa potential obstruction of justice and which occurred after bothLehman and Paisley had left the government.   The government frequently relies on gaining the cooperation ofparticipants in a white-collar conspiracy to win the conviction ofbigger targets.   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has issued adirective specifying that any Pentagon employee under scrutiny inthe bribery probe must be reassigned to a new job, said spokesmanDan Howard.   Confirming earlier reports from Pentagon sources, Howard saidCarlucci had directed that anyone who became ``the subject of theinvestigation'' must be given ``duties that will not involve themin on-going procurements or provide them access to informationrelated to on-going procurements.''   While no individual has been charged yet, ``Secretary Carluccitook this action in the interest or ensuring that the on-goingprocurements of the department are free from question,'' Howardadded.   The spokesman repeatedly declined to say how many Pentagonworkers had been affected by Carlucci's directive, referring allsuch queries to the Justice Department.   Pentagon sources, demanding anonymity, later disclosed thedirective had so far led to reassignments for six employees _ fiveidentified last week in search warrants, plus a sixth, unidentifiedemployee whose office was not searched but who is also underinvestigation.   Efforts to learn the sixth employee's identity and job were notimmediately successful. The other five are:</TEXT><TEXT>   _James Gaines, the deputy assistant Navy secretary foracquisition management.   _Dr. Victor Cohen, the deputy assistant Air Force secretary incharge of buying tactical command, control, communications andcomputer systems. His office was searched last week.   _George Stone, a Navy official in the Space and Naval WarfareSystems Command.   _Stuart Berlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command.   _Marine Corps official Jack Sherman, who works in the equipmentand service acquisition section of the contracts division,installation and logistics department.   The move by Carlucci followed a high-level meeting on Monday atwhich Pentagon officials reportedly studied what actions they couldtake in the case.   Carlucci may also consider whether to suspend contracts with thecompanies involved in the probe, including some of the biggestmilitary suppliers in the country. The companies' offices weresearched last week in pursuit of illicitly obtained insidecontracting information.   Suspension of contracts could be disruptive to the military,ruinous for contractors who live or die on government business, anddamaging to their employees.   One source said he doubted so dramatic a step would be taken atthis point because the Defense Department itself lacks informationabout the dimensions of the affair.   ``I don't think the FBI is sharing much with us yet,'' he said.   The New York Times reported today that three additional defensecontractors _ Hercules Inc., Gould Inc. and Electronic Data SystemsCorp., a General Motors Corp. subsidiary _ acknowledged that theyhad been subpoenaed in the probe.   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Rep. Bill Chappell, chairman of theHouse Appropriations defense subcommittee, denied that he or anyother member of Congress is under investigation.   ``There's is no member of Congress, to my knowledge, who is atarget of this investigation _ and I'm a member of Congress,'' theFlorida Democrat told reporters. ``If there's anyone that'sinvolved in the kind of activities alleged, he should be broughtswiftly to justice.''   CBS News reported Monday night that three congressmen _ Reps.Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.; Andrew Ireland, R-Fla., and Sam Stratton,D-N.Y. _ were under scrutiny in the case, but that there was notyet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation. CBSsaid it got its information from law enforcement sources whom itdid not identify.   Spokesmen for Downey and Ireland said no government official hadcontacted either congressmen or their offices in connection withthe probe. Downey blasted as ``wholly incorrect'' a newspaperarticle linking him with the investigation. CBS said Stratton'soffice also said it had not been contacted.   The U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, HenryHudson, who is coordinating the investigation, held out thepossibility that more information about the scope of the affair maycome this week when more of the 38 search warrants issued a weekago are unsealed and made public.   One search warrant that has already been made public said theinvestigation centers on leaks of confidential information _``provided by government employees receiving bribes or gratuities''_ about contracting details which could enable one company tooutbid another.   Hudson said 270 subpoenas have been issued so far and moresearch warrants may be served.   The affair came to light June 14 when federal investigatorsseized materials from defense contractors, military consultants andDefense Department officials.   Meese called his news conference to respond to a senator'sassertion that the Justice Department had squelched testimony aboutprocurement corruption three years ago.   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., in a Senate speech, said aDefense Department investigator about to testify on his findingsconcerning procurement corruption was kept from doing so by a topJustice Department official who grabbed the microphone away fromhim.   ``I stopped the hearing at that point,'' Grassley said. ``I wishnow I hadn't. There wasn't anything in that testimony that couldhave jeopardized that case.''   Meese, at his own news conference after Grassley's comments,said, ``I can assure you that at no time has this department had tobe dragged into any indictment where the evidence is there.''   The attorney general said that since 1985, the defenseprocurement fraud unit has obtained 35 convictions and recoveredsome $32 million.</TEXT></DOC>
