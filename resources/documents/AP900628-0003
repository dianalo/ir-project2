They are victimsof a war on squatters waged by a city of plenty with little roomfor its poor.   Since March 15, when a winter moratorium on evictions ended,riot police arriving before dawn have cleared dozens of buildings.   The evictions inspire denunciations, demonstrations and chargesthat the city of Paris, where housing prices are soaring, is tryingto push the poor out of town.   ``We're miserable here because we have nothing,'' said Assa Kan,a 30-year-old woman from Mali with six children. They are among 150people who have lived under tents since May 2 in the Place de laReunion.   ``At night, it's really cold,'' she said, caressing the chappedcheeks of her 4-month-old daughter. ``All the children are sick.''   Hers is the largest of three camps set up by squatters orrenters turned out of condemned buildings. Nine families camp atthe foot of Sacre Coeur, the Montmartre basilica, and six liveoutside a city government office.   In announcing the spring offensive, Paris officials saidsquatting had reached ``inadmissible'' proportions.   ``The city is duty-bound to solve this problem'' and evictionsare ``the only way to stop the multiplication of squatters,'' saidJean Tiberi, deputy to Mayor Jacques Chirac.   Within days, 300 people were homeless, nearly half of themchildren.   ``These people had a right to squat,'' said Abbe Pierre, abearded Roman Catholic cleric who is France's premier champion ofthe needy. ``When a man is hungry, he has the right to take breadfrom the baker.''   Abbe Pierre's humanitarian organization, the Emmaus Community,provided tents for those evicted.   A siege mentality prevails in the Place de la Reunion, which isringed with rosebushes and dotted with orange and blue tents.   Amenities consist of one water spigot, three portable toiletslike those used at construction sites, and intermittent lighting atnight via an extension cord from a nearby cafe. One tent serves asa kitchen.   Mrs. Kan and others said they would remain until the cityprovided a suitable alternative.   ``We are confronted with the unacceptable,'' Bertrand Main,deputy chief of the League of Human Rights, told reporters.``Demands for rehousing are met with a wall of silence,incomprehension and, sometimes, contempt.''   Paris proposed temporary housing for the evicted in buildingsscheduled for demolition in St. Denis, a poor northern suburb.Officials there objected.   ``We don't have a money problem in Paris; we have a problem ofland,'' Tiberi, the deputy mayor, said in explaining the housingshortage on French radio.   ``For moral reasons ... we cannot accept the principle ofrehousing squatters,'' who rob legal occupants of apartment space,he said.   At a news conference, Abbe Pierre said: ``It is a crime torefuse lodging in a city like Paris, where several thousandapartments are vacant.''   The Committee Against Poor Housing, a protest group that findsvacant buildings for squatters, claims there are 3,000 to 4,000vacant, government-subsidized Moderate Rent Housing units aroundParis. The city denies it.   Officials say the number of buildings occupied by squatters,most of them Africans, has grown from 36 to 187 in three years and41 of the buildings are subsidized units, which have a waiting listof 50,000.   Mayor Chirac said in a letter to Abbe Pierre, made public June20, that rehousing evicted squatters would be a ``profoundinjustice'' to people on the waiting list. ``Paris is a city withheart,'' he said, ``but ... neither the capital nor the Parisregion can take in all the misery of the world.''   Critics claim the city is being transformed into a ghetto forthe elite.   President Francois Mitterrand denounced those ``who enrichthemselves while sleeping'' because they own ``a good piece of landor a nice apartment.''   Prices have risen so quickly, he said, ``that they are startingto exclude the possibility of suitable lodging for seniorexecutives with salaries that can reach 50,000 francs per month,''about $8,700.   Frederica Koch and Amina Amara are among those keeping a vigilwith the homeless at the Place de la Reunion.   Ms. Koch was evicted last year from the rent-controlledapartment she occupied for 25 years and, at 58, is a squatter. Shelost her job as a clothes cutter during a 10-year battle to keepher home.   Ms. Amara, a single woman with five children, has been on awaiting list for a low-rent apartment for 15 years. After evictionfrom one building, she and her two youngest children spent a yearin a shabby hotel and two months in a restaurant basement beforesquatting anew in December.   ``This problem is too big for us,'' said Berhima Tembely, animmigrant from Senegal who paid a sympathy visit to the square.``The rich people are treating us like dogs. You have to fight tolive in this world.''</TEXT></DOC>
