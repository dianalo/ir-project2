 For computer systems to be effective, they must be secure sothat information stored in them is accessible only to authorized users.andM;Computer security usually involves several components:andM;* physical security of the computer installations so that unauthorizedpersons may not enter the installations.andM;* identification, authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure thatpersons accessing the computers remotely are allowed access to the systemsonly if they are authorized to have such access.andP;  Use of login names andpasswords is the most common mechanism to control user access to computersystems although some sensitive installations require that the user insert auser identification card in specially designed user terminals.andM;* physical security of computer terminals is also used in some sensitivecomputer systems.andP;  This usually restricts the user to access the computersystem only through one of the designated terminals that are placed inphysically secure locations.andM;This article deals only with user authentication.andP;  Methods for verifying theidentify of an individual can be divided into four classes:andM;(1) objects in the possession of the individual, such as keys, id cards,passports, etc.andM;(2) knowledge that the person has, such as lock combination, password, PINnumber, etc.andM;(3) actions such as signature or patterns of behavior.andM;(4) physiology such as the physical description, fingerprints, retinalpattern, voice pattern, etc.andM;Computer systems commonly use the first two of these categories, e.g.,andO;possession of keys to the building along with a valid username/password, orpossession of a bank card along with knowledge of its corresponding PINnumber.andP;  Some work has been done in the last category but as of yet thesetechniques require expensive, specialized hardware and software.andP;  To date,the &quot;actions&quot; category has been largely ignored.andM;Use of login names and passwords is the most commonly used mechanism forstatic identification and authentication.andP;  The apparent ease with whichhackers have been able to access many systems that were considered secureclearly indicates the inadequacy of the password mechanism for verifyingidentiy and therefore there is a need for other, more reliable, securitymeasures.andM;Society has relied on the written signature to verify the identity of anindividual for hundreds of years.andP;  The complexity of the human hand and itsenvironment make written signatures highly characteristic and difficult toforge precisely.andP;  In current computer systems, the signature has beenreplaced by a username/password pair (coupled with encryption schemes) forstatic identification and authentication.andP;  One problem with this scheme isthat it relies entirely on the &quot;knowledge&quot; category of authenticationtechniques, and has abandoned the information contained in the &quot;actions&quot;category.andM;The handwritten signature has a parallel on the keyboard.andP;  The sameneurophysiological factors that make a written signature unique are alsoexhibited in a user's typing pattern.andP;  When a person types on a keyboard,he/she leaves a digital signature in the form of keystroke latencies (theelapsed time between keystrokes).andP;  For well-known, regularly typed stringsthis signature can be quite consistent.andM;The idea of using keyboard characteristics in identifying and verifyingindividuals is not new and some products that use such characteristics havebeen known to be in the market and others have been rumored to be ready forrelease.andP;  Unfortunately however, the effectiveness of such systems is notknown since the techniques used in these products are often confidential andvery little research about their effectiveness is available in the publicdomain.andM;In the last few years Gaines, Lisowski, Press and Shapiro [2], Umphress andWilliams [7], Garcia [3], Leggett, Williams and Umphress [6], Leggett andWilliams [5] and Young and Hammon [8] have studied the use of keystrokecharacteristics in verifying identity of a person.andP;  Gaines et al.andP;  [2]describe an experiment in which seven professional secretaries at the RandCorporation were asked to type the same three passages of text at twodifferent times separated by four months.andP;  All secretaries were not availableto type all three texts at both sessions and complete data was available foronly 11 sessions.andP;  Each of the three passages of lowercase text was about300-400 words long.andP;  The first passage was an ordinary English text, thesecond a collection of random words while the third was a collection ofrandom phrases.andP;  Keystroke latency times between adjacent letters (calleddiagraph latency times) were computed for each individual and were found tovary from 75 msecs to several seconds.andP;  Also, it was found that there waslittle difference in the digraph times in the three passages and therefore,for each individual, the information from the three texts was merged.andP;  Sincethe digraphs considered involved only lower-case letters and spaces, therewere 27 X 27 possible different digraphs.andP;  Most of these 729 digraphs eitherdid not occur in the typed material or occurred only infrequently.andP;  Theanalysis therefore was based on only those digraph values that had at least10 or more replications for each sitting of each individual.andP;  There were 87such digraphs.andP;  These digraph values were transformed by removing theoutliers and then taking the logs of the remaining values.andP;  Logarithms of thevalues were used because it was assumed that the raw data was log-normallydistributed and the transformed data was found to be approximately normallydistributed.andP;  A classical two-sample t-test of the hypothesis that the meansof each digraph times at both sessions were the same was carried out assumingthat the two variances were the same for each individual.andP;  It was shown thatthe number of digraph values that passed the test were typically between 80percent to 95 percent.andM;Gaines et al.andP;  also studied the suitability of such digraph latencyinformation in authenticating identity.andP;  As noted earlier, there were 87digraph values that had 10 or more samples for each of the eleven differentsessions.andP;  Each authentication test involved selecting one of these sessionsas the reference session and each of the remaining 10 sessions as a sessionfrom a person (or claimant) wishing to access the computer system.andP;  A totalof 55 such tests can be carried out given the data and the symmetry of thetests.andP;  Using the same t-tests, it was found that out of the 55 tests, theimposter (1) pass rate (percentage of invalid user attempts being accepted)was zero and the false alarm rate (percentage of valid user attempts beingdenied access) was about 4 percent (2 out of 55).andP;  Further analysis wascarried out in an attempt to identify what Gaines et al.andP;  [2] call key orcore digraphs.andP;  It was found that if only five digraph values (viz., in, io,no, on, and ul) were used, the authentication procedure worked perfectlyi.e., no imposter pass or false alarms were found.andM;Although the results of [2] are encouraging, their study had a number oflimitations.andP;  The most important being the number of individuals involved inthe experiment.andP;  Their results therefore, particularly those relating to useof only five digraphs in authentication, need much further investigation.andM;Umphress and Williams [7], Leggett, Williams and Umphress [6] and Leggett andWilliams [5] report the results of two experiments similar to the experimentconducted by Gaines et al.andP;  [2].andP;  The first experiment had 17 programmers ofvarying typing ability provide two typing samples, the first with about 1400characters that served as a reference profile and the second of about 300characters that served as the test profile.andP;  In the second experiment, 36participants typed in a 537 character passage at two different timesseparated by over a month.andP;  The basis of the research of [6] is to use twokeystroke characteristics of the user.andP;  The first measure is the mean of thekeystroke latencies of the user, essentially the user's typing speed.andP;  Thesecond indicator involves comparing digraph latencies between all digraphcombinations that have been typed by the user with reference latencies in a26 X 26 reference latencies matrix whose rows correspond to the first letterof a two letter digraph and columns correspond to the second letter.andP;  In thesecond experiment, blank was added as a valid character in digraphs and thefirst part of the test that was based on the mean of all keystroke latenciesof the user was dropped since it was found not to add any discriminatingpower to the verifier.andP;  Since many of the digraph latencies occur onlyinfrequently, the standard deviation of the reference profile latencies(i.e., all the latencies in the reference profile) is used as a measure oftolerance of a match.andP;  If the test digraph latency time was within 0.5standard deviations of the reference digraph latency mean then the latencywas counted as valid.andP;  The ratio of valid digraph latencies to totallatencies in the test string was then computed.andP;  If the ratio was above 0.6,the user was considered to have passed the verification test.andM;In [5] 12 different digraph latency tests were evaluated.andP;  These includedusing different maximum digraph latencies allowed to remove outliers (viz.,andO;300 msecs, 500 msecs and 750 msecs) as well as applying the test to only asubset of the digraphs, for example, the subset identified by [2] or 6 and 15most frequent digraphs, left-hand-only digraphs, right-and-only digraphs,etc.andP;  It was found that if the five digraphs identified by [2] as coredigraphs were used, the false alarm rate was above 30 percent and theimposter pass rate above 17 percent.andP;  The best results were obtained by usingall digraphs involving lower-case letters only and the blank with a maximumlatency of 500 msecs.andP;  This digraph latency test resulted in an identityverifier with false alarm rate of only about 5.5 percent and imposter passrate of about 5.0 percent.andP;  Although the above low error rates are quiteimpressive, the imposter pass rate of 5 percent is still too high to beuseful as an identity verifier since an imposter pass is a breach of thesystem security.andP;  A false alarm rate of 5 percent could well be acceptablesince it would be nothing more than a nuisance in that a genuine user would,on the average, fail to get access to the system 1 out of 20 attempts.andO;Therefore a reliable identity verifier would require techniques that wouldreduce the imposter pass rate to well below 1 percent.andP;  A lower false alarmrate would also be desirable but, as noted above, not essential.andM;The experiments discussed above have a major limitation in that they requiredthe users to type in rather large character strings, first for generating thereference latencies data and then for verification.andP;  In spite of this, in theexperiments of [6] it was necessary to use standard deviation of thereference profile latencies as a measure of tolerance of a digraph latencyfor each digraph latency in the matrix.andP;  Verification itself required theuser to type in a large number of characters.andP;  For example, in the experimentof [2], a total of more than 1000 words needed to be typed by each claimant.andO;The experiment of [7] required the user to type 300 characters while thesecond experiment reported in [5] required 537 characters.andP;  A static identityauthentication system would not be successful if it asked the user to typelong strings for reference purposes and another long string every time forverification purposes.andM;Garcia [3] describes of U.S.andP;  patent for a method and apparatus for identityverification based on a somewhat different approach.andP;  He suggests that thebest data for identity verification is derived when an individual typeshis/her own name since the latencies generated by the user in typing his/hername have been found to be stable and unique.andP;  In addition, the name is theeasiest password to remember.andP;  The first step of the procedure suggested by[3] involves the user typing his/her name a number of times to prvide avector of mean latencies to be used as a reference.andP;  This Garcia calls theelectronic signature of the individual.andP;  In addition, the covariance matrixof the vectors of reference latencies is computed as a measure of theconsistency of the individual's signature.andP;  In computing the vector of meanlatencies and the covariance matrix, the outliers are removed.andM;When a person wants to access a computer resource, he is required to identifyhimself by typing in his/her name.andP;  The latency vector of the keystrokes ofthis name is compared with the reference signature that is stored in thecomputer.andP;  If this claimant's latency vector and the reference signature arestatistically similar, the user is granted access to the system.andP;  TheMahalanobis distance function is used to measure the similarity of the twovectors.andP;  It is recommended in [3] that if the computed distance measure ismore than 100, the vectors should be considered dissimilar and if less than50, the vectors should be considered similar.andP;  If a value of between 50 and100 is obtained, it is suggested that the claimant be required to retype thename.andP;  Although no evidence is presented, the suggested procedure is claimedto have an imposter pass rate of 0.01 percent and a false alarm rate of 50percent.andP;  Garcia notes that the thresholds for acceptance and rejection maybe altered if one wishes to reduce the false alarm rate and is willing toaccept a higher imposter pass rate.andM;Garcia [3] also suggests another procedure which he calls complexdiscrimination.andP;  Rather than using the same string for an individual, complexdiscrimination involves the individual to type in each of at least 1,000 ofthe most common words in the English language at least 10 times to providethe reference raw data.andP;  Now, for verification, a random phrase is generatedby the computer using the common words used in the reference and the user isrequired to retype that phrase.andP;  The latencies recorded by the user are thencompared with the latencies stored in the computer and the user is permittedaccess only if similarity between the latencies is established.andP;  Noinformation about the effectiveness of this approach is present.andP;  Theapproach is of course not practical in most applications since it requiresquite a long session to generate the reference data.andM;More recently, another U.S.andP;  patent for identity verification has beengranted to Young and Hammon [8].andP;  Young and Hammon use the term keystrokedynamics to denote the typing pattern of an individual including featureslike latencies and keystroke pressures.andP;  Although the details of theprocedure used in the invention are not described clearly, it is suggestedthat a plurality of features be used.andP;  These could include digraph latencytimes, time to type in a predefined number of keystrokes, time to enter somecommon words (e.g., the, and, for).andP;  The identity verifier itself its basedon first obtaining reference features (it appears that the features includekeystroke latencies and possibly keystroke pressures) about a user and thencomparing the vector of these features with similar features extracted from aclaimant's typing session.andP;  The comparison is based on computing theEuclidean distance between the two vectors of features.andP;  No information ishowever presented about the effectiveness of the techniques used.andP;  Young andHammon also propose that the identity verifier should typically operate on acontinuous basis (this is sometimes called dynamic verification) in contrastto static verification that takes place only once at the start of each loginsession.andP;  Further, it is suggested that the keystroke timing device could belocated in the terminal itself and the terminal could send the encoded timinginformation to the computer that the claimant wishes to access.andM;In this article, we use an approach for static identity verification similarto that used in [3h.andP;  Our approach is based on using keystroke informationobtained during the login process using a modified login sequence.andP;  Inaddition to using the login name and password, we propose that the user berequired to type in two additional strings that are familiar to the user, forexample, the user's first and last names.andP;  An identity verifier using thelatency information obtained when only user-name and password are used in thelogin process was found to provide good performance (around 1 percentimposter pass rate), but the additional two strings improved the performanceconsiderably.andP;  Although more than four strings may be desirable to obtainaccurate information about a user's keyboard characteristics, we feel a usercannot be expected to type in much more than four strings for verificationpurposes.andP;  Also we believe the information obtained from typing fourwell-known strings is likely to be more reliable than information obtainedfrom a user typing in a large number of unfamiliar strings since typingfamiliar strings is less error prone and does not involve difficulties likereading text from paper and therefore provides a more distinct signature.andO;Using the names as additional strings to be typed would provide data obtainedfrom text strings that, for most people, would not change for their lifetime.andP;  Using the name could well be suitable for applications like the ATMswhere the user could be asked not only to type in his/her PIN, but alsohis/her name.andP;  The results of present study suggest that the combination ofthe PIN and the keystroke characteristics obtained when the user types inhis/her PIN and his/her name could provide a very secure system.andM;IDENTITY VERIFIERandM;The proposed identity verifier uses the following approach.andP;  First, for eachuser, the procedure described below is followed to obtain a referencesignature (analogous to a written sample signature) consisting of latencyinformation recorded during the modified login process suggested earlier.andO;Each time the user desires access to the computer system, he/she provides adigital signature (called the test signature or the claimant's signature)during the login process.andP;  The claimant's identity is verified if thisdigital signature matches the reference signature stored in the system.andM;To obtain a reference signature, we follow an approach similar to that usedby the banks and other financial institutions.andP;  A new user goes through asession where he/she provides a number of digital signatures by typing in thefour strings several times.andP;  Note that in the present environment the digitalsignature has four components, one component for each string that the usertypes.andP;  The system requires a new user to provide eight reference signaturesby typing his/her username, password, first name and last name eight times.andO;The number 8 was chosen to provide sufficient data to obtain an accurateestimation of the user's mean digital signature as well as information aboutthe variability of his/her signatures.andP;  We discuss the impact of selectingfewer reference signatures in the upcoming section, &quot;Evaluating theVerifier.&quot;andM;A signature or a component of a signature can be visualized by plottingcharacters typed versus latency times between successive keystrokes.andP;  Thepoints thus obtained may be joined to obtain a signature &quot;curve.&quot;andP;  In thepresent system the signature curve has four component curves (onecorresponding to each of login name, password, first name, last name).andP;  Asample curve for a user with last name &quot;Stephenson&quot; is shown in Figure 1.andM;As illustrated in Figure 1, the first latency time stored is the elapsed timefrom the keystroke of the first letter to the second.andP;  The last latency timeshown is the time from the last character to the carriage return.andP;  Thelatency from the time of the prompt to the striking of the first character isdiscarded as its variance can be high.andM;As noted earlier, the identity verifier would need to compare a testsignature provided by the user wishing to access a computer system with thereference signature; allowing access if the test signature is similar to thereference signature.andP;  To carry out the comparison, a mean reference signatureis first computed by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the 8values for each latency.andP;  For each latency, the mean is then compared witheach of the 8 values of that latency and any outliers (datum greater thanthree standard deviations above the mean) are discarded.andP;  This resulted in0.85 percent of the latencies being discarded, the discards being distributednearly uniformly over the string.andP;  The mean of the remaining values for eachlatency is now calculated.andP;  This process is repeated for each latency of thefour login strings to produce four sets of mean latency values for each user.andO;These four sequences (or &quot;curves&quot;) are collectively referred to as the meanreference signature for the user.andM;Some of the reference signatures that had a latency discarded were studied todecide if all latencies from such signatures should be discarded and anadditional reference signature requested.andP;  We found that the discardedlatencies were isolated instances of large variances and the stringscontaining them usually had acceptable values of other latencies.andM;A suitable technique is now needed for comparing a test signature with themean reference signature.andP;  The approach used by [7] involves comparingindividual latencies of the test signature with mean reference latencies andaccepting the test signature as having been verified if more than 60 percentof the test latencies are valid.andP;  As discussed earlier, a latency wasconsidered valid if it was within 0.5 profile standard deviations of the meanreference digraph latency.andP;  This approach has a major weakness in that someof the latencies in the two signatures being compared could differsubstantially but the test signature could still pass the verification test.andM;Empirical investigations were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe approach used by [7] in our environment.andP;  The parameter values 0.5 and0.6 used in the test were varied and results studied.andP;  Preliminary resultssuggest that the approach is not particularly reliable for comparingsignatures.andM;Another approach of comparing two signatures is to look at each signature asa vector that consists of the set of 4 vectors of latency values.andP;  The meanreference signature, M, is then given by:andM;M = {[M.sub.username], [M.sub.password], +.sub.firstname], [M.sub.lastname]}andM;Now comparing M with a test signature, T, involves comparing the two vectorsand determining the magnitude of the difference between them.andP;  In the ensuingdiscussion, let M = ([m.sub.1], [m.sub.2], ..., [m.sub.n]) and T =([t.sub.1], [t.sub.2], ..., [t.sub.n]) where n is the total number oflatencies in the signature.andM;The present verifier computes the magnitude of the difference between M and Tas the [l.sub.1] norm:andM;[**M - T**.sub.1]andM;given by:andM;[summation of all i's from i=n to i=1] *[m.sub.i - t.sub.i.]*andM;Although this approach works very well it has a weakness in that it does nottake into account the shape of the signature curves.andP;  The difference betweenthe shapes of the test and reference signatures could be significant even ifthe differences in the latency values are small.andP;  A more reliable comparisonof M and T would probably include some technique of comparing the shapes ofthe signatures.andP;  We discuss some preliminary work on using the slopes of thetimes between successive latencies as a measure of shape later in thisarticle.andM;Once the magnitude of the difference between a given T and M has beencomputed, a suitable threshold for an acceptable size of the magnitude isrequired.andP;  We have chosen to set the threshold for each user based on ameasure of the variability of his/her signatures.andP;  A user that has littlevariability in his/her signatures would have a small threshold while anotheruser with large variability should have larger threshold for acceptinghis/her test signatures.andP;  We therefore need to compute a measure of variationbetween the 8 reference signatures, and the mean reference signature obtainedfrom them as described above.andP;  Let the 8 training signatures be, [S.sub.1],[S.sub.2], ..., [S.sub.n].andP;  We calculate ||M - [S.sub.i]||1 for i = 1 to 8.andO;The mean and standard deviation of these norms are used to decide a thresholdfor an acceptable norm value of the latency difference vector between a givenT and M.andP;  If we set the threshold value to be mean plus one standarddeviation, we would expect the user to successfully login about 84 percent ofthe time (a false alarm rate of about 16 percent) assuming that the latencydifferences between the 8 reference signatures and the mean signature arenormally distributed.andP;  A threshold value based on two standard deviationsshould provide a false alarm rate of less than 3 percent although theimposter pass rate with a larger threshold would obviously be expected to belarger.andP;  The threshold is presently defined as the mean plus one-and-one halfstandard deviations.andM;The verification algorithm now works as follows.andP;  The claimant attempts alogin thereby providing a test signature, T, to the system.andP;  The norm [||M -T||.sub.1+ is computed and if this norm is less than the threshold for theuser, the attempt is accepted, otherwise it is flagged as an imposterattempt.andP;  Figure 2 shows the four possible judgments of the verifier.andM;EVALUATING THE VERIFIERandM;The verifier was implemented on a SUN[TM] 350 workstation.andP;  Thirty-threeusers with typing speeds, measured when login name/password and name wastyped, varying from 14 to 11 wpm participated in the following trials of theauthentication algorithm:andM;(1) Each user provided his/her reference signature by typing in their loginname, password, first name and last name eight times.andM;(2) Once the reference signature was obtained, each user attempted to log onto his/her own account five times, yielding 165 total set login attempts.andO;The target user data, both reference and self login attempts, were collectedduring a single session.andM;(3) Six of the above users were randomly selected as targets for theremaining 27 users.andP;  Each of the 27 users were allowed five imposter attemptsfor each of the six target users, yielding 810 imposter login attempts.andP;  Allof the login information, including passwords, was given to each imposter butthe imposters did not witness the target users' trials.andM;Not all users participating in the above trials knew about the purpose of thetrials.andP;  One-half of the users were given no information about the verifieror the purpose of the trials.andP;  The remaining users were told what the trialswere for and how the verifier worked, but were asked to login normally; i.e.,andO;they were asked not to try to exploit the verifier by employing unnaturaltiming quirks that would make their signature extremely difficult to match.andM;The above 975 trials resulted in an imposter pass rate of 0.25 percent (2 ourof 810) and a false alarm rate of 16.36 percent (27 out of 165) over all thetrials.andP;  How the false alarm rate can be significantly reduced will bediscussed later in this article.andM;We now present some results of the trials in detail.andP;  Figures 3-8 showresults of six users (who were the targets of imposter attempts) logging inas themselves as well as attempts of other users logging in as imposters.andO;Although each of the six users was the target of 27 imposters, we presentresults of only the eight closest imposters to keep the figures legible.andP;  Thevertical axes in the graphs indicate [||M - T||.sub.1] in seconds.andP;  Thehorizontal axis shows the successive login attempts.andP;  Each line plotteddepicts the 5 successive login attempts by one of the eight imposters.andP;  Eachof the figures shows the target user typing rate, the number of characters inthe signature, the mean and standard deviation of [*S.sub.2 - M*.sub.1.,] theauthentication threshold, the best imposter attempt, the worst imposterattempt, the mean imposter attempt, and the number of false alarms andimposter passes.andM;Figures 3-8 summarize results of 840 trials including 30 referencessignatures and 810 imposter attempts, with a total of 5 false alarms and 2imposter passes.andP;  This leads to a false alarm rate of 16.67 percent (5 out of30) and an imposter pass rate of 0.25 percent (2 out of 810).andP;  The falsealarm rate is high, although it amounts, on the average, to only 1 out of 6attempts being rejected (and therefore requiring another attempt).andP;  This ratecan however be reduced.andP;  The threshold used in the above trials was the meanplus 1.5 standard deviations.andP;  As noted earlier, if the threshold isincreased, the imposter pass rate should increase and the false alarm rateshould decrease.andP;  We have studied the impact of varying the threshold on thefalse alarm rate and the imposter pass rate, as shown in Figure 9.andP;  Theseresults show that the false alarm rate could be reduced substantially withouta significant increase in the imposter pass rate if the threshold forverification was increased from 1.5 standard deviations to 2.andP;  The imposterpass rate at two-and-one-half standard deviations was still under 1 percent(7 out of 810), while the false alarm rate fell to 6.67 percent (2 out of30).andM;A detailed study of the imposter passes and false alarms was carried out.andO;This has led to the following observations:andM;(1) Only two imposters were able to successfully pass as another user.andP;  Theimposter passes involved a target user (user2) that had the highestauthentication threshold (2.27 seconds as compared to 0.80, 1.68, 0.56, 1.59,and 1.51 seconds for the other five users in the group user1 to user 6), andin Figure 9, accounts for one-half of the imposter passes at 3 standarddeviations, and one-third of the imposter passes at 5 standard deviations.andO;Since the verification threshold was chosen to be one-and-one-half standarddeviations away from the mean, a high variation gives imposters an easiertarget.andP;  This is similar to the problems faced by financial institutions whensome elderly people and people with physical disabilities are unable tosupply a precise signature.andP;  In such cases, the verification scheme suggestedin this article may be inappropriate and some other means of identityverification could well be required.andM;(2) There was no significant correlation between knowledge of the verifierand the ability of an imposter to match the reference signature of anotheruser.andM;(3) The variation of imposter pass rate and false alarm rate with the numberof reference signatures obtained is given in Figure 10.andP;  The use of eightreference signatures is supported although the experiments suggest that asfew as six reference signatures might be sufficient.andP;  Since the referencesignatures are signature samples that are used to estimate mean and standarddeviations of the signature latencies, to obtain good estimates any fewerthan six reference signatures could not be recommended.andM;(4) The experiments support the use of four strings in the signature.andP;  Ifonly two strings were used (that is, login name and password), the imposterpass rate was found to be somewhat higher although the false alarm rate atone standard deviation threshold was about the same.andP;  Figure 11 shows two-and four-string login imposter pass rates for thresholds varying from themean to the mean plus 5 standard deviations.andM;(5) During testing a number of uses challenged the authors that they couldsuccessfully pass as another user.andP;  A number of such users were allowed tologin as some other user.andP;  These imposter attempts were not organized andtherefore detailed results are not presented but it is satisfying to notethat all such attempts failed except one imposter who after observing thetraining session of the target, was able to pass as that user once in 57attempts.andM;DISCUSSION AND FURTHER AREAS OFandM;RESEARCHandM;An earlier version of this experiment was carried out using 600 imposterlogin attempts against six uses [4].andP;  Although the analysis was not ascomprehensive as the results presented here, there are a few points worthnoting:andM;* The results support those presented here, with a false alarm rate of 13.3percent (4 out of 30), and an imposter pass rate of 0.17 percent (1 out of600).andM;* Users with &quot;easy-to-type&quot; login sequences were easier targets for impostersthan those with more complex typing patterns.andP;  Although &quot;easy to type&quot; isdifficult to define, short signatures are generally easier targets forimposters.andP;  The target of the successful imposter attempt had only 16characters in the four strings.andP;  Imposter login attempts with this user asthe target showed the fastest mean typing rate of all imposter attempts,implying that users found the strings relatively easy to type.andP;  This isanalogous to having a very simple signature that is relatively easy to forge.andO;The difficulty arising from short signatures may be overcome in part byinsisting on a minimum total length, and/or a minimum length for each of thefour components of the signature.andM;* A zero imposter pass rate threshold exists for every target user in bothexperiments such that the false alarm rate is less than 40 percent (andtypically is much lower).andP;  This means that there were no observed cases wherean imposter did better than the target's best self-login attempt.andM;We now suggest a number of areas of further research.andP;  Firstly, a morecomprehensive testing of the verifier is needed.andP;  Our testing included usesof varying computer literacy and typing abilities, but these were all betweenthe ages of 20-42 years, and all were university students or staff.andP;  The&quot;strongest&quot; (i.e., most difficult to replicate) signatures appear to comefrom the most experienced computer users.andP;  A more comprehensive testingshould include a wider cross section of users.andP;  Secondly, other measures ofcomparing M and T, and combinations of such measures need to be evaluated.andM;Improving the Performance of the VerifierandM;Although the present verifier is highly reliable with an imposter pass rateof less than 1 percent, further research is needed to reduce this rate.andM;As discussed earlier, a possible approach to improving the performance of theverifier would be to extend the comparison of the test signature and the meanreference signature to include a comparison of the shapes of the signatures.andO;Handwritten signatures often have outstanding characteristics such as largeloops or straight lines that serve as focal points during the identificationprocess.andP;  To capture analogous information in a digital signature, we havelooked at laternative measures that take this into account.andP;  Digitalsignatures often show sharp changes between successive latencies as a resultof an individual's unique typing pattern.andP;  Some preliminary testing has beendone on a measure which measures the difference between the values ofsuccessive differences in latencies (which could be called &quot;slopes&quot; of thesignature curves) in the test signature and the corresponding differences inthe mean reference signature.andP;  Since we wish to highlight the outstandingdifferences in slopes as the distinctive features of a digital signature, thedifferences in the slopes were weighted by the amount of slope change in thereference signature.andP;  Let the vector of slopes of the mean referencesignature M be denoted as I given by: I = ([i.sub.1], [i.sub.2] .andP;  .  .  ,andO;[i.sub.n-1]), and similarly define J as the vector of slopes of the testsignature T as: J = ([j.sub.1], [i.sub.2] .andP;  .  .  , [j.sub.n-1]), see Figure12.andM;A measure of the difference between the shapes of M and T is given by:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;where [w.sub.k] is defined as:andM;[Mathematical Expression Omitted]andM;Figure 13 shows the imposter pass rate versus the false alarm rate for thismeasure over 100 imposter login attempts.andP;  although the results are not quiteas good as the total distance measure, we believe it is worthwhile to studythe use of the combination of the two tests.andP;  Depending on the degree ofcorrelation of the two measures, the combined test may bring the imposterpass rate to below 0.01 percent without increasing the false alarm ratesignificantly.andM;Knowledge of how the verifier works may be exploited to provide additionalsecurity.andP;  A user may wish to add unusual timing characteristics to hissignature making it very difficult to forge.andM;Timing AccuracyandM;For the verifier to work, it is necessary to obtain accurate timinginformation with sufficient resolution.andP;  On a dedicated machine this may notbe a problem, however on a time-sharing system where access may be through avariety of networks and hard/form/software, sufficiently accurate timinginformation may be difficult to obtain.andP;  The best solution to this, assuggested by [8] would probably be for the keyboard to capture the latenciesand transmit this information upon request.andP;  Further work is needed toaddress this problem.andM;Other Uses of the VerifierandM;Although we have only discussed identity verification aspect of the presentwork, it is likely that the techniques described here would prove useful indetecting whether a user is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs oris excessively tired.andP;  It is expected that the signature of a user wouldchange, possibly substantially, under the influence of drugs although we havenot had an opportunity to test this assumption.andM;A mechanism for detecting an intoxicated or tired user may be of use insecurity or safety sensitive installations where it may be important that theuser (or operator) of the computer system be alert to deal with anyemergencies that may arise.andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;We have described an identity verifier that uses keyboard latency informatio captured during a user's login process to verify the identity of the user.andO;The verifier described was found to have an imposter pass rate of less thanone percent when the imposter knew the target user's login name, first andlast name, as well as the password.andM;We have also reported preliminary results of using a technique based oncomparing signature shapes for identity verification.andP;  These results areencouraging, suggesting the possibility of combining the two techniquesproposed in this article to further reduce the imposter pass rate.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;  The authors wish to thank Cameron Gregory and Jiang Yi fortheir efforts in collecting the data, as well as all the users who happilyparticipated in our experiments.andP;
