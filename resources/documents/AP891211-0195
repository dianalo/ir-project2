Richardo Bordallo was resentencedTuesday to four years in federal prison and fined $10,000 forwitness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice.   Bordallo, who served as governor of this U.S. territory in theWestern Pacific from 1982 to 1986, was convicted in 1987 of 10counts and sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedlyexchanging political favors for payoffs, but a federal appealscourt last year reversed eight of those counts and set aside thesentence.   Bordallo, who turned 62 on Monday, will pay his own way to theU.S. mainland and report to the federal prison, once the Bureau ofPrisons has made an assignment, said Bordallo's attorney HowardTrapp.   Mike Cruz, of the federal probation office here, saidnotification of where Bordallo is to report could come in as littleas two weeks.   Bordallo, who met briefly with supporters outside the courtroombut declined to talk to reporters, remains free on his ownrecognizance.   During his trial, federal proseuctors said Bordallo approvedgovernment contracts and permits for various firms in exchange forpayments, mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes.   The money was described by the donors as campaign contributionsor gifts, but never was reported by Bordallo in his campaignstatements, authorities said.   He also was accused of approving a $103,000 government contractfor a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said four bribery-realtedconvictions were reversed because the federal crime of briberyapplies only to state officials and Guam is a territory.   It said four extortion-related convictions were reversed becausethe jury was not told it must find Bordallo demanded or otherwiseinducted the payoffs, totaling $79,600 in cash.   The appeals court upheld the convictions of witness tamperingand conspiracy to obstruct justice.   U.S. District Judge Cristobal Duenas resentenced Bordallo tofour years and fined him $5,000 on the witness tampering charge andgave him a three-year suspended sentence on the conspiracy chargeand fined him $5,000.   Bordallo, a Democrat elected in 1982, was indicted a few daysbefore the 1986 Democratic primary. He won the primary, but wasdefeated in November 1986 by Republican Joseph Ada.</TEXT></DOC>
