As the market for large commercial aircraft softens, planesellers, parts suppliers and carriers say an overcapacity ofpassenger jets -- particularly narrow-bodies -- has surfacedduring the past few months, especially in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   It's a situation that was in the making even before theIraqis stormed into Kuwait, forcing oil prices higher. And itthreatens to damp expansion plans at the Big Three aircraftmanufacturers, Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and theEuropean consortium Airbus Industrie.   &quot;At the moment, you can't say it's terribly serious, butthere is certainly cause for concern,&quot; says Paul Turk, ananalyst at Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm. &quot;Theairlines have been adding seats faster than the system canabsorb them. That depresses yields. And if we continue to seea fall in passenger traffic and the continuation of depressedyields, carriers are going to start walking away&quot; fromaircraft buys.   Airline yields, important indicators, measure the amountof revenue for each mile they fly a passenger.   Some airline executives who refrained from placing hugeorders are now openly gloating. &quot;Some of these plane ordersare coming back to roost,&quot; says Trans World Airlines ownerCarl Icahn, who only ordered limited numbers of jets inrecent years. &quot;Everybody was jumping on that bandwagon, andI'm glad that we didn't.&quot; Mr. Icahn says the $1.2 billion TWAhas in cash will be more valuable than a fleet of new planesin an economic downturn. A recession could badly hurt thestruggling carrier.   &quot;Domestic growth just isn't occurring at the rates mosthad been expecting,&quot; says an executive at one major aerospacesupplier. His company predicts that airliner deliveries willaverage about 600 a year through the end of the decade -- nota level of more than 1,000, which is the figure arrived at ifthe projected production schedules at the Big Three aretotaled. &quot;Six hundred is wonderful,&quot; he says, &quot;but somebodyis wrong, and swings can still kill companies.&quot;   Many experts discount the Doomsday predictions, notingthat orders for wide-body jetliners remain robust and airtraffic continues to surge on international routes, primarilyin the Pacific Rim. The East Bloc, meanwhile, could turn intoa fertile selling ground for Western plane makers.   At Farnborough, the aerospace industry's big air show nextmonth in England, each of the Big Three is likely to announcea number of large bookings. On top of that, UAL Corp.'sUnited Airlines remains ready to purchase as much as $15billion in aircraft once its buy-out situation becomesclearer; British Airways PLC, among others, is also shoppingaround.   Still, the overall trend in firm orders is decidedlydownward. Boeing has received bookings for 255 jets, valuedat $24 billion, so far this year, compared with 659 aircraftvalued at $34 billion to this point in 1989, a record amount.At McDonnell Douglas, orders have slipped to 103 planes from113.   Across the industry, placements for narrow-body aircraftdropped 59% through June to 312 from 766.   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst at Bateman Eichler,Hill Richards Inc., says he recently scaled back hisprojections for new orders this year at market leader Boeingto $40 billion from $45 billion, and he sees the figurefalling to $25 billion for 1993. But he believes the declineshouldn't have much of an effect on the manufacturer'sprofitability. That's because the Seattle company is workingoff a backlog that already is big enough to keep it busy forthree or four years, and that reservoir should continue toswell through 1992.   A Boeing spokesman notes that the company is pushing aheadwith plans to launch a new twin-jet, the 777, and remainsfirmly committed to ramping up its production rates.   &quot;We're not getting calls for wholesale cancellations,&quot;adds William Messecar, a top business planner for McDonnellDouglas's commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. &quot;Ifyou look at the order curve of the past few years, we justcan't keep going up that slope. But that doesn't mean theindustry is going in the tank, either.&quot;   Yet others are more bearish, predicting that if theeconomy slows enough, &quot;options,&quot; or less-than-totalcommitments that airlines have taken for planes, couldevaporate. Even firm orders, some say, could begin todisappear.   &quot;The timing of a recession matters a lot when it comes tobuying and selling aircraft,&quot; says Jerry Lundquist, who hasdone a detailed analysis of the commercial jet market forMcKinsey andamp; Co., the management consultants.   His research suggests the start of a long, largelyunanticipated slide in orders and, ultimately, less outputfrom the Big Three. One big factor in his analysis, he says,is that older Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s aren'tbeing retired as quickly as many had anticipated. Even withthe improved fuel-burn and smaller cockpit crews that newerplanes feature, &quot;older aircraft are still economicallycompetitive,&quot; Mr. Lundquist contends.   Coupled with the spate of newer planes starting to bedelivered, the result is the current glut of narrow-bodies.&quot;The industry has gone through this again and again,&quot; Mr.Lundquist says. &quot;It's either feast or famine.&quot;   At some point, of course, the recent aircraft buyingfrenzy will squeeze the oldest planes into retirement. Butbecause of the flood of available aircraft, the resale marketwill weaken.   And if airlines are getting less money for their olderplanes as they turn them over to freight haulers and othersecondary users, it crimps their ability to make capitaloutlays for new aircraft.   Already, the market's foundation seems to be cracking abit. In June, USAir Group Inc. postponed delivery of a dozenBoeing 737s for more than three years because of slowingtraffic growth, although at the same time it placed ordersfor 24 additional planes. Marc Desautels, president ofPolaris Aircraft Leasing Corp., says he understands thatother deferrals by airlines &quot;are in the works.&quot;   Among the carriers that may backtrack, Delta Air Lines issaid to be studying a decision not to exercise options onsome MD-80s, although the company says it won't do that.Midway Airlines already has canceled some of its options onMD80s. The small Chicago-based carrier also plans to returnthree DC-9s to a leasing company at the end of the thirdquarter when the leases expire.   Midway executives say it's a good thing that new planesthey have ordered won't be delivered until the end of 1991,limiting fleet growth until then. &quot;We think the economicclimate is soft,&quot; says Alfred Altschul, the company's chieffinancial officer.   The Persian Gulf crisis, with its accompanying rise infuel costs and threat of economic repercussions, onlyexacerbates the potential for worsening profits at theairlines and, in turn, plane makers. &quot;It's grim,&quot; saysMichael Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at AmericanAirlines, a unit of AMR Corp. Recently, American officialsstarted reducing their traffic-growth expectations based onadvance booking levels, which indicate how many seats arereserved on a flight before it departs.</TEXT></DOC>
