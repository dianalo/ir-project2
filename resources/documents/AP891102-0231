They are: ``Battered,'' a story of domestic violence againstwomen (HBO); ``Homeless,'' about a family whose house burns down,starring Christine Lahti and Jeff Daniels (CBS); and ``StayingTogether,'' a theatrical movie about family survival in a smalltown (Hemdale).   Notice that all three deal with social problems. That's onlynatural with Grant, an actress-director who has long beenassociated with causes, and who spent 12 years on the filmindustry's blacklist because of it.   Grant recently presented ``Staying Together'' at the MontrealWorld Film Festival, where it was well received.   What makes Lee Grant run? Fear of boredom, yes. A socialconscience, of course. But also a creative drive that has won hertwo Academy Awards, as supporting actress in ``Shampoo,'' 1976, andas director of a documentary about the homeless, ``Down and Out inAmerica,'' 1987.   ``Staying Together'' centers on three brothers (Dermot Mulroney,Tim Quill, Sean Astin) who face a crisis when their father (JimHaynie) suddenly sells the family chicken restaurant. When thefather dies, the family starts to disintegrate, but the boys'mother (Melinda Dillon) brings them back together.   Grant's producer in all her projects is her second husband, JoeFeury. ``Staying Together'' proved a surprisingly easy sell forthem.   ``I have pictures I've tried to get on for 10 years,'' she said.``I was speaking to John Daly of Hemdale about another film, but hewasn't interested because it dealt with South Africa; he wasn'tsure of the economic viability. I said I had another script, whichwas `Staying Together.' He read it, liked it and gave us thego-ahead. He said we should go either with names or unknownsbecause he thought it was strange to mix the two. We decided to gowith unknowns for the three boys.''   She filmed ``Staying Together'' on a $7 million budget in thehamlet of Ridgeway, S.C.   Grant, a New Yorker, admittedly knows nothing about small-townlife. ``But it's like making a documentary: I want to make thejourney, I want to find out what it's all about and I did. Thetownspeople accepted us as part of them.''   She grew up in Manhattan the daughter of indulgent parents whoencouraged her self-expression. At 18 she was touring as Ado Anniein a road company of ``Oklahoma!'' In 1949, she drew rave noticesas Meg Mundy in Sidney Kingsley's hit play ``Detective Story.'' Sherepeated the role in William Wyler's film version, receiving anOscar nomination.   Grant's career was in high gear when she landed on theblacklist, apparently because her then-husband, writer ArnoldManoff, was suspected of being a communist.   ``I had to teach when I was blacklisted,'' she said. ``I wasn'tallowed to act. In starting to teach so early _ I was 19 _ Istarted dealing with actors and working on their problems. I knowthat experience put me on the road to being a director.   ``It's ironic that something I thought was death at the time,because it took all my ingenue years, turned out to be the verything that was my strength.''   Grant finds a curious parallel between her career and that ofher daughter, Dinah Manoff, who appears in ``Staying Together.''   ``Dinah got the Neil Simon play `I Want to Be in Pictures,' forwhich she won a Tony. Then she got the film with Walter Matthau.And then there was nothing. So she started as a star with greatacclaim and awards, and then nothing,'' Grant said.   ``Until she got the series, `The Empty Nest,' it was a realstruggle for her, a kind of trial by fire. I think if she hadgotten everything as easily as she did at the start, she would notbe either the person or the actress that she is today. I saw her gothrough the pain and the confusion of `Why did they want me so muchone year, and not want me at all the next?'   ``In going through all that and keeping on studying and findingthe places in herself that she liked, I think she has become one ofthe strongest people I know.''   What happens to the actress Lee Grant when the director becomesso busy?   ``She gets lost,'' Grant sighed. ``Every once in a while shestarts to cry. She starts to get funny feelings that are veryuncomfortable, and I hear myself saying: `I don't feel enough.What's happening to me?'   ``I don't connect it to the fact that I'm not feeling on thelevel that I feel when I act. That's when I do something. This yearI did `The Achille Lauro' and got all my suffering out of mysystem. I felt much better and became a person I could live withagain.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, Nov. 7</NOTE></DOC>
