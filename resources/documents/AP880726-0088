Vernon Walters said he thought it was unlikely there would beany re-establishment of relations with Tehran, at least in the nextcouple of months, because of the hostage situation.   Walters made the remarks amid statements from the Reaganadministration that it is prepared to discuss the hostage problemwith Iran, but only with authoritative figures and with nodeal-making.   President Reagan, asked Monday whether the time had come to talkto Iranian officials about the hostages, replied, ``If they'rewilling and ready to talk, it's time.''   The administration has expressed interest in establishing adialogue with ``authoritative'' Iranian leaders, but no officialhas yet publicly suggested that a rapprochement could take place inthe absence of a hostage release.   In an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'', Walters was askedif it was possible to normalize relations with Iran before the nineAmerican hostages are released.   ``Well, it would be very difficult,'' he replied. ``There's noquestion that the people that are holding the hostages have somekind of allegiance or connection with Iran. I think it would bevery difficult for us to justify anything unless they released thehostages.''   Walters said Iranian officials would have to explain why thehostages remain in captivity.   ``I mean, what are they holding these people for, that havenothing to do with the policies they don't like?'' the ambassadorsaid. ``These people are college professors and doctors andlibrarians, and what have they got to do with the U.S. governmentpolicies that the Iranians don't like? It's a totally illogical andrather cowardly thing to hold those hostages.''   ``I think the whole fact that they seized our embassy and held150 people there hostage for a year, they've probably destroyed theembassy or seriously damaged it,'' Walters said. He said therewould have to be arrangements about ``where we'd go'' and a wholelot of other complicated logistical arrangements   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials hopethat Iran's acceptance of a U.N. ceasefire resolution ``will leadto an improving relationship and circumstances where we might beable to have a dialogue.''   ``But that does not diminish the fact that we will only have adialogue with authoritative representatives of the government,''the spokesman said, ``and that has not occurred.''   The White House often has said that it was doing all it could towin the release of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon bypro-Iranian elements, and recent developments have prompted newspeculation about a possible hostage release.   Reagan made only a terse statement in response to a reporter'squestion Monday as the president concluded a Rose Garden ceremonyhonoring youths selected for the American Legion's Boys Nationpolitical studies program.   The president has steadfastly defended his administration'sclandestine sale of U.S. anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles tothe revolutionary government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in1985-86.   Reagan has offered conflicting accounts of whether the salesamounted to an arms-for-hostages deal.   Two hostages, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and David Jacobsen, werereleased during the time of the transfers of U.S. arms to Iran.Money from the arms sales eventually was diverted to the NicaraguanContra rebels, leading to the Reagan administration's worst scandal.   Reagan did not elaborate on his terse statement of Monday.   But Fitzwater told reporters that ``our position remains thesame, that we're always available to talk any time, any place aboutthe safety or the release of the hostages but we will not negotiatefor them and we don't anticipate any negotiations.''   An administration official noted earlier Monday that the UnitedStates had sent a new message to Iran last week asking about thepossibility of talks aimed at normalizing relations. Tehran stillhas not sent an ``authorized'' reply, the official said.   The official, who asked not to be identified, said the UnitedStates would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the PersianGulf war, the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, andterrorism. But he said the U.S. message did not specify conditionsfor a resumption of relations, which were severed in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
