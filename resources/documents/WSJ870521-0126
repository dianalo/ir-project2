The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Knoxville, is by far the biggest the FDIC has filed against accounting firms since it began such suits in 1980. Ernst andamp; Whinney is the third biggest U.S. accounting firm, with U.S. revenue of $900 million in its latest fiscal year.    Cecil Underwood, an FDIC attorney in Washington, said the agency believes that Ernst andamp; Whinney was &quot;extremely negligent in the audits and that the suit represents substantial liability exposure on the part of the accounting firm.&quot; Mr. Underwood said the funds would replace money in its insurance reserves that the FDIC has already given to thousands of depositors of the four banks.    Ray Groves, chairman of Cleveland-based Ernst andamp; Whinney, said the firm will &quot;vigorously defend itself against these allegations.&quot; The suit, he added, is &quot;another example of the FDIC attempting to push off to an auditor its own regulatory obligation.&quot;    Mr. Groves said that when the FDIC did its concurrent audit of the Butcher banks in 1982, it wouldn't tell outside auditors the results of its examination, which revealed &quot;intricate collusion and fraud among the many Butcher banks.&quot;    The banks, run by Jake Butcher, and his younger brother, C.H. Butcher Jr., collapsed in 1983. In the case of one of the banks, United American Bank in Knoxville, Ernst andamp; Whinney issued a clean audit opinion on its financial statement in January of that year. Twenty days later the bank was closed by federal regulators and has since been merged with another bank. Both Butcher brothers are serving jail terms on fraud charges.    The suit alleges that Ernst andamp; Whinney's partner in charge of Butcher bank audits, Walter Boruff, borrowed $53,000 from Butcher banks during the years the accounting firm performed the audits, and at other times. The borrowings, the suit declares, impair &quot;Ernst andamp; Whinney's independence.&quot;    Reached at his Knoxville office, Mr. Boruff declined to comment, referring any queries to Mr. Groves.    Asked about the loan, Mr. Groves declined comment, saying he hadn't yet had time to study the details of the suit.    The suit charges that Ernst andamp; Whinney violated auditing standards by relying on internal audit staffs of the banks for confirmations of commercial loans. It also alleges that the accounting firm discovered that the banks forgot to mail confirmations covering $16 million of such loans.    Legal experts in the accounting profession see the latest FDIC suit against Ernst andamp; Whinney as an escalation of the government effort to regain funds for failed financial institutions. &quot;This new FDIC suit is definitely upping the ante and could present a major liability and insurance problem for accounting firms,&quot; said Dan Goldwasser, special counsel for liability matters for the New York Society of Certified Public Accountants.    Ernst andamp; Whinney already is facing a lawsuit by the FDIC seeking $180 million involving the accounting firm's audits of the troubled Continental Illinois Corp., the Chicago-based bank holding company. A trial in that suit has entered its 13th week.    Since 1980, the FDIC has filed lawsuits against eight accounting firms involved in failed banks. Last year Peat Marwick, currently the biggest U.S. accounting firm, settled out of court with the FDIC on a suit asking for $88 million in the failure of Penn Square Bank in Oklahoma City in 1982. Peat, which was Penn Square's auditor, paid $18.5 million to settle the FDIC suit.    In this suit against Ernst andamp; Whinney, the FDIC has chosen Melvyn I. Weiss, a New York attorney who has been extremely successful in negligence suits against accountants, as its attorney. Mr. Goldwasser said the FDIC's choice of attorney indicates the intensity of its effort to avoid the fate of the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., which has seen its funds severely depleted by thrift failures.    The FDIC wants to maintain its strength as an insurer and &quot;is dead serious in seeking major return of funds from accounting firms,&quot; Mr. Goldwasser said. </TEXT></DOC>
