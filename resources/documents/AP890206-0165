The 71-year-old Marcos recognized family and friends and was ableto respond to simple commands, such as to raise his right hand, saidSt. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman Norma Kop.   Marcos remained in the intensive care unit attached to arespirator to regulate his breathing, Kop said.   ``He's still in critical, but he's showing signs ofimprovement,'' she said. ``He's more alert.''   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with pneumonia andbronchial asthma. While in the hospital, he suffered a collapsedlung, which was reinflated, and underwent a tracheotomy to relievethe buildup of fluids in his lungs.   Along with his wife, Imelda, Marcos was indicted last October onfederal racketeering charges accusing him of plundering hishomeland's economy and stashing much of the money in the UnitedStates. A hearing this week in New York to decide whether he ishealthy enough to stand trial has been postponed until March 6.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston confirmed that thehearing before U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan, had been put offat the defense' request.   Ms. Livingston would not comment on why the defense had sought adelay, saying it was not on the public record.   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5million bail.   Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel visited Marcos onThursday in the hospital and said Marcos should be forgiven andallowed to die in his homeland, where he ruled for 20 years.   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused to meet withLaurel and receive a message from Marcos.   ``It is not a matter of me not wanting to talk to him, but I feelsince he says this is a matter of great import to the Filipinopeople, I think he should inform the people directly instead of withme because people might have the wrong impressions that we arekeeping something from them,'' Mrs. Aquino said Monday in Manila.   Marcos was ousted in a February 1986 civilian-military revolt andhas lived in Hawaiian exile since, with Mrs. Aquino forbidding hisreturn.</TEXT></DOC>
