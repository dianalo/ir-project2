Contributors represent mine and plant personnel,academic and government or semi-government representatives, and the topicscovered range from mining and metallurgical techniques and planning tofinancial analysis, project evaluation, information systems, computergraphics, geostatistics, etc. For the 20th APCOM, the Proceedings havebeen divided into the three broad categories of mining, metallurgy andgeostatistics, and are grouped accordingly into the three published volumes.The theme of this Symposium - 'special emphasis on the practical applicationof computers to implement the many powerful theoretical techniques inthe workplace' - was chosen to underline the practical needs of industry.Contributions from both local and foreing participants demonstrate howestablished geostatistics and related disciplines have become. Apartfrom the more classic applications of estimation and simulation, thepapers deal with optimisation of drill sites and spacing, identificationof geological patterns, determination of potential prospecting targetsand the processing of geochemical and geophysical data. New and moreunorthodox applications such as the use of expert systems, the enhancementof remotely sensed data and production forecasting are also dealt with.The papers represent the state of the art in the workplace. Reflectingback on the 10th Symposium, it is clear that the field of geostatisticshas flourished in the last 15 years and will go from strength to strengthin the future.</TEXT></DOC>
