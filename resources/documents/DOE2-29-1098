<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-29-1098 </DOCNO><TEXT>VISION is a computer program that performs a 2-band (solar and thermal),one-dimensional, thermal analysis of a wide variety of glazing systems.This paper outlines modifications that permit VISION to output resultsgraphically on the computer screen. The screen graphics software augmentsthe program's graphical plotter output. The user can examine the cross-sectionof a glazing system showing the position and thickness of each glazingas well as the presence of optical coatings. The glazing system geometrycan be checked to see if the system was properly described at the timeof input. The indoor/outdoor temperature profile is superimposed on theglazing system so that condensation problems at the cold indoor glazingor overheating problems caused by absorbed solar radiation can be pinpointed.A printscreen utility allows the user to reproduce graphical output usinga graphics printer. 9 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
