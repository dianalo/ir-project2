Although profits of 12,150 commercial banks slipped 12%from a year earlier, the FDIC report showed that theindustry's equity capital, a cushion against failure,increased by $3.6 billion during the quarter to $226.84billion. That amount represented 6.7% of total assets -- thehighest percentage since 1975.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, there was a glimmer of hope that problems inasset quality are moderating. The total of noncurrent loansand leases fell for the first time since the fourth quarterof 1989, though the decline was tiny -- $232 million to$80.07 billion.   Results for the nation's 456 federally insured savingsbanks were far less encouraging. Their losses totaled $506million in the second quarter, compared with $274 million inlosses a year earlier. Nearly one in three savings banksposted losses, compared with one in nine commercial banks.   The banking industry is &quot;bumping along the bottom of therecession,&quot; said FDIC Chairman William Seidman. &quot;It doesn'tlook like it's getting much worse, but it doesn't look likeit's getting a whole lot better.&quot;   So far this year, banks are failing at a slower rate thanexpected. The agency has projected 160 failures, and 85 havefailed in a little more than nine months. But Mr. Seidmansaid the agency expects an acceleration of bank failureslater in the year, which could reduce the balance of the bankdeposit insurance fund &quot;to something around one, two, threebillion dollars by year end&quot; from $4.52 billion on June 30,Mr. Seidman said.   &quot;Clearly, the fund will be in need of recapitalization;whether it's actually down to insolvency or not, it will bebelow levels at which we can operate effectively,&quot; warned Mr.Seidman. Legislation before Congress would give the FDIC $70billion in new borrowing authority. The banking industrywould pay back the loans over time through premiums ondomestic deposits.   The fund's condition by year's end will &quot;depend on a fewmajor banks that may or may not fail,&quot; said Mr. Seidman.&quot;Some of those we're encouraged about now, some not soencouraged.&quot;   Federal regulators are particularly worried about thecondition of Southeast Banking Corp. in Miami, Hibernia Corp.in New Orleans, and Houston-based First City Bancorp. ofTexas.   Despite the gloomy second-quarter profit report, Mr.Seidman expressed some hope that the worst may be over forthe industry. He noted that the growth rate of noncurrentreal estate loans-the industry's primary burden-is slowing.   The FDIC chairman also said industry profits should behigher this year than last. &quot;If we had to pick a number, I'dsay that the industry ought to end up the year, unless we getsome surprises, with earnings in the area of $18 billion to$19 billion, which would not be an outstanding year butcertainly would be better than some we've seen in the recentpast,&quot; said Mr. Seidman. Commercial banks earned $16.4billion last year and $15.7 billion in 1989.   The outlook for savings banks, state-chartered thriftsthat specialize in real estate lending, remains dreary. &quot;Thefuture of the saving bank industry, particularly in NewEngland, depends on a recovery of the distressed real estateassets in that area,&quot; said Mr. Seidman.   Although the free-fall in New England real estate priceshas ended, Mr. Seidman said the Northeast is &quot;bumping alongthe bottom region.&quot; He identified the Washington, D.C., areaas the region with the worst real estate problems. The realestate picture on the West Coast is mixed, with some strengthin Washington, Oregon and Northern California but worries inSouthern California.</TEXT></DOC>
