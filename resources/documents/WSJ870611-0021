But the rally faded quickly amid continued doubts about the dollar's recent stability.    Sparked by a surge in the dollar, prices of some actively traded 30-year Treasury issues initially rose more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount. But as the dollar ran out of steam, so did Treasury bonds, winding up an erratic trading session little changed from Tuesday.    &quot;In these highly volatile swings, buyers and sellers&quot; of bonds &quot;are spooked for good reason,&quot; said Richard B. duBusc, a managing director at First Boston Corp. Nevertheless, some of the latest new issues, including large deals for Chase Manhattan Corp., Chrysler Financial Corp. and Columbia Gas System Inc., sold briskly, according to several underwriters.    A $275 million note offering by Chase Manhattan, for example, sold out within hours after it was syndicated, said Jason M. Elsas Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;We had some very large institutional orders,&quot; he added, noting that &quot;there's an appetite&quot; for new issues now yielding more than 10%.    The Chase financing, originally set for mid-May at $200 million, was canceled abruptly after Citicorp disclosed a $3 billion increase in its loan-loss reserves.    Once again, the dollar's movements sent ripples through all the financial markets. The credit markets &quot;were keyed very closely to fluctuations in the dollar,&quot; said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at Carroll, McEntee andamp; McGinley Inc.    &quot;A lot of anxieties&quot; about the completed economic summit in Venice among the U.S. and six of its leading trading partners &quot;have been put to rest as the dollar held firm,&quot; said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. &quot;The summit turned out to be a non-event. But all of the finance ministers seem to be of one mind to defend the current structure of exchange rates. That makes people more cautious about selling the dollar short,&quot; he contended.    The dollar likely will face another hurdle tomorrow when the Commerce Department releases the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for April. According to the average estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the deficit widened slightly to $13.9 billion from $13.6 billion in March. Estimates ranged from $12.8 billion to $16.5 billion.    While many analysts say the deficit is narrowing in volume terms, it is likely to remain nominally high because of the dollar's sharp fall this year against other major currencies. &quot;The dollar will drift erratically lower because the trade deficit will remain high in nominal terms,&quot; said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services.    As a result, the bond market will remain under pressure with yields on long-term government issues bouncing between 8% and 9% this year, he predicted.    Leon G. Cooperman, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said that the economy is headed for moderate growth in the next 12 months and that interest rates probably won't drop much further in the near future. Speaking at a meeting Tuesday night, Mr. Cooperman also predicted that the yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bond, now about 8 3/4%, will hover between 8 1/2% and 9 1/2% for the foreseeable future.    Mr. Hale of Kemper Financial Services said the transition from an economy marked by strong consumption and weak production in recent years to an economy that shows weak consumption and strong production will continue to buffet the credit markets. &quot;As we get near fall and real economic growth picks up to between 3% and 4%, we'll see the beginning&quot; of inflationary pressures. He predicts, for example, that the U.S. steel industry will be operating at 85% capacity by the middle of 1988.    Some credit market specialists, however, are convinced yields on long-term bonds have peaked for this year. &quot;We'll see the bulk of a 75 to 100 basis point drop in yields between now and year-end,&quot; said Paul F. Baeri, a managing director at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. &quot;The inflation premium already built into the market is fine and there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines that sooner or later will be committed to fixed-income securities,&quot; he contended.    That would be a big relief for the securities industry. &quot;The second quarter was absolutely miserable for everybody&quot; in the fixed-income markets, said Mr. Baeri. &quot;This quarter's profits will probably will be the lowest in the last eight to 10 quarters on Wall Street; there are massive losses out there.&quot;    In yesterday's activity, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 fell to 100 3/32 from 100 1/8 Tuesday, while the yield was unchanged at 8.74%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rose to 99 18/32 from 99 17/32 as the yield was unchanged at 8.57%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. fell 0.54 point to 1278.41. The high for the day was 1291.20, while the low as 1274.91.    The federal funds rate hovered around 6 5/8% most of the day, averaging 6.63%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.68% Tuesday, 6.75% Monday and 6.70% last Friday. Rates also fell on short-term Treasury bills. The latest three-month Treasury bill rate fell to 5.47% bid from 5.52% Tuesday, while the latest six-month bill rate fell to 5.87% bid from 5.90%.    Yesterday's large corporate offerings included:    --A $515.9 million offering of Chrysler Financial notes backed by automobile loans with a final maturity of May 1992. Underwriters led by First Boston priced the 8.30% notes at 99.60 to yield 8.49%. The notes are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $275 million issue of Chase Manhattan subordinated equity-commitment notes, due June 1999. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the 10% notes at 99 3/4 to yield 10.036%. The notes are rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $225 million offering of American Southwest Financial Corp. collateralized mortgage securities. Yields ranged from 7.725% on short-term floating-rate notes to 10.60% on 19-year bonds. The issue is rated triple-A by Sandamp;P and is being sold by Prudential-Bache Capital Funding.    --A $200 million issue of Columbia Gas System sinking fund debentures due June 2012. Underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. priced the 10 1/2% notes at par. The issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's and tripleB by Sandamp;P.    --A two-part, $200 million debenture offering by FPL Group Capital Inc. It consists of $100 million of 10-year debentures and $100 million of 30-year debentures. The 10-year, 9 3/8% debentures were priced at 99.577 to yield 9.44%. The 30-year, 10 1/8% debentures were priced at par. Both are rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-plus by Sandamp;P. Salomon Brothers heads the underwriting group.    --A $175 million issue of Armco Inc. senior notes due June 1994. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the 13 1/2% notes at par. The issue is rated single-B-2 by Moody's and single-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Santa Barbara Savings andamp; Loan Association mortgage-backed bonds due June 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the 8 3/4% notes at 99 7/8 to yield 8.78%. Salomon said the bonds are expected to be rated triple-A by Moody's.    In the municipal bond market, portions of several large new issues that were tentatively priced Tuesday were changed yesterday. For example, parts of a $175 million offering of revenue bonds by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia were altered by an underwriting group led by First Boston Corp. Yields now range from 6% on bonds due 1991 to 8.375% on bonds due 2020. Previously, yields ranged from 6% in 1991 to 8.364% in 2017.    Separately, an issue of water and sewer system revenue bonds by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority was restructured and repriced by underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The size was increased to around $160.3 million from about $155 million. Yields now range from 4.25% on bonds due 1988 to about 8.32% on bonds due 2016. The issue had been tentatively priced Tuesday to yield from 4.50% in 1988 to about 8.39% in 2016.    The issue also includes zero-coupon bonds priced to yield from 7.50% in 1999 to 8% in 2007. These initially were priced to yield from 7.60% in 1999 to 8.10% in 2007.    Bonds due from 1988 through 2007 are insured by Bond Investors Guaranty and will be rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P, the underwriters said. They expect the rest of the issue to be rated Baa-1 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    An issue of about $58.5 million of general obligation bonds by Utah got off to a slow sales start. The unsold balance among underwriters late yesterday totaled $48 million. The issue was priced after auction to yield from 5.30% on bonds due 1991 to 5.90% on bonds due 1994. First National Bank of Chicago heads the underwriters. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P.    The Federal Reserve this afternooon is scheduled to release money supply statistics for last month. Most analysts in several recent surveys expect the data to show very little growth in two broad money measures, known as M2 and M3. That would leave both measures well below the Fed's target range of 5 1/2% to 8 1/2% growth this year.    With both the economy and the nation's money supply growing sluggishly, the Federal Reserve probably won't tighten credit conditions any further, many analysts agree. But the Fed also isn't likely to ease credit conditions, they say, because of continued concern that such a move would depress the dollar in the foreign exchange markets.    The M2 measure, which rose $13.1 billion in April, grew only $2.5 billion last month, according to the median estimate of 28 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif. Individual estimates ranged from no change at all to a $14.2 billion rise, said John M. Lilley, an economist at Money Market Services.    If the Fed's report today shows an M2 increase of only $2.5 billion, that would leave it about $13.5 billion below the lower end of the Fed target range.    The M3 measure, which rose $15.8 billion in April, expanded only $7 billion during May, the survey predicted. Individual forecasts varied widely, ranging from a decline of $5 billion to an increase of $17.7 billion. If today's Fed report does show an M3 rise of $7 billion, that would leave it about $10.7 billion below the lower end of the target.    The Fed also will report on the basic money measure, known as M1, for the week ended June 1. Many analysts expect the report to show M1 fell $3 billion.    The Fed doesn't have a target this year for M1, which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public. The M2 measure includes everything in M1 plus certain types of savings, including money market deposit accounts. The M3 measure includes everything in M2 plus some types of investments, such as large certificates of deposit. </TEXT></DOC>
