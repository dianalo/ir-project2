Michael Dukakis moves into the final six weeks of the race in contention and maybe even on a modest roll.    The Dukakis forces, reeling for weeks under a relentless barrage from Vice President George Bush and his savvy handlers, believe Sunday night's debate at Wake Forest University arrests the Bush advance and gives them the ammunition they need to open, finally, an attack of their own.    &quot;We were looking for an event like this to turn things around,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, a senior Dukakis aide. &quot;It laid a foundation for the final six weeks,&quot; says Susan Estrich, the campaign manager.    Nevertheless, the vice president still holds an edge heading into the final stretch, as Sunday night wasn't anything like a clean victory for Mr. Dukakis. He missed key opportunities to rebut Mr. Bush's constant efforts to pin him down as an &quot;out-of-the-mainstream&quot; liberal. He was especially weak attempting to explain his support of the American Civil Liberties Union and his position on moving ahead with expensive new weapons systems.    &quot;George Bush continued to label him as a far-left liberal,&quot; says New York pollster Douglas Schoen.    &quot;He's got to address this 'liberal' label head-on,&quot; says Sen. John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat. &quot;He's got to show he's in the mainstream of America, not over on the left side.&quot;    The Bush forces pointed out that the vice president, while hammering Mr. Dukakis as a liberal, also managed to survive the highly stylized 90-minute debate without making a serious mistake, hardly a triumph for a man who boasts he has the fattest resume in Washington. James Baker, the Bush campaign chairman, boasted that the vice president came across as &quot;warm, human and likable.&quot;    But the biggest plus for the GOP nominee may have been Mr. Dukakis's slowness in replying to charges about his membership in the American Civil Liberties Union and his opposition to many weapons systems. Initially, the Democratic nominee tossed off the criticisms on his defense views and it wasn't until later in the debate that he got around to specifying which weapons systems he favored.    And it wasn't until yesterday, more than 12 hours after the debate, that the Democratic nominee distributed a fact sheet, in Cleveland, pointing out that he disagreed with the ACLU on revoking the tax-exempt status of the Catholic church and on removing &quot;under God&quot; from the currency. At a rally in Jersey City, N.J., last evening, Mr. Dukakis said it was &quot;nonsense&quot; to suggest that he embraced every position of the ACLU.    Mr. Dukakis did assail Mr. Bush for the Reagan administration's dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and its involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. But some critics thought this was pretty tame stuff. &quot;It's incredible he didn't rev it up,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican theoretician. &quot;It's incredible he never mentioned Ed Meese or Mike Deaver or foreign lobbyists or the Pentagon scandals. This is the first Greek-American who can't spot an Achilles heel.&quot;    The Dukakis managers promise a more aggressive campaign now, vowing to take the offensive on some of Mr. Bush's assertions Sunday night, including his defense of past dealings with Panamanian dictator Gen. Noriega and of former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos.    They will respond to Mr. Bush's standard attack on chemical weapons by saying he cast three tie-breaking votes in the Senate to renew U.S. production of these weapons. And, in their continuing battle to win the support of middle-class voters, they will argue that in 1981 the Reagan administration ended Medicaid coverage for half a million mothers and children.    They have already begun to press Mr. Bush harder on Social Security. They believe the vice president didn't adequately assure voters Sunday night that the Social Security trust fund won't be raided to pay for new Bush domestic initiatives and to keep the defense buildup going.    Finally, they will try to capitalize on Mr. Bush's statement Sunday night that he hasn't &quot;sorted out&quot; the penalties that would be imposed if a constitutional amendment were passed banning most abortions. The Bush campaign issued a clarification yesterday, explaining that Mr. Bush believes, after &quot;thinking about it overnight,&quot; that women undergoing abortions shouldn't be penalized but doctors performing abortions should be.    On a more general level, they will try to take advantage of perceptions that Mr. Bush is an erratic performer, pointing to his bumbles and fumbles and the way his voice and his emotions seem to rise and fall.    Perhaps the issue that offers them the most hope is Mr. Bush's selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate. The idea of Mr. Quayle as President Quayle, Mr. Dukakis said Sunday night, &quot;is a very, very troubling notion.&quot;    &quot;Quayle is building as a problem for Mr. Bush,&quot; says Mr. Phillips, the GOP theoretician.    Mr. Dukakis seems reluctant to wage a negative campaign, but he isn't reluctant when it comes to Mr. Quayle, and the tempo of the attacks on the Indiana senator will escalate as the time approaches for the vice presidential debate in Omaha, Neb., Oct. 5. The Dukakis camp is preparing some tough anti-Quayle ads this week.    Toughening up the Dukakis campaign is John Sasso, who was dismissed by Mr. Dukakis a year ago after he leaked a videotape damaging to Democratic rival Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware. He was brought back early this month to help revive the faltering campaign. After days of bickering, Mr. Sasso seems to have seized the reins and is now reshaping the campaign's organizational and media efforts. The result, some professionals believe, will be a more sharply focused campaign with a more aggressive response to the Bush challenge.    But Mr. Sasso can't solve all the campaign's problems. One tough problem: The solid South is beginning to look solid Bush.    &quot;We're getting the first faint suggestions that Democratic politicians in the South are edging away from the top of the ticket,&quot; says Charles Cook, a political analyst who keeps track of statewide races around the country. &quot;They {the Dukakis campaign} still have 30 staff people in Florida,&quot; says Mr. Cook. (&quot;Well over 30,&quot; says a Dukakis aide.) &quot;That's absurd. It was absurd from the start. They have no shot in Florida.&quot;    Traveling through the South yesterday, Mr. Bush -- who made a rare campaign appearance with his running mate, Sen. Quayle -- was buoyantly ridiculing his opponent, challenging the Democratic nominee to release his plan to bolster the military. &quot;What is your secret plan, governor?&quot;    In a way, getting the first debate behind them seems to have liberated the two candidates. Both of them seem more aggressive and more enthusiastic, although already some strategists in both campaigns were saying a close race will significantly boost the stakes for the second and final debate in two weeks.    But Alan Baron, a Democratic political analyst who believes Mr. Dukakis scored points Sunday night thinks the importance of the debates is exaggerated enormously, including Sunday's.    &quot;It was dull,&quot; says Mr. Baron, and the big winner might have been the Fox Broadcasting Network, which stuck to its regular schedule Sunday night (but televised the debate on a delayed basis). &quot;Fox should be able to boost its advertising rates during the next debate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
