The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicatorsdipped 0.1 percent in June. While the amount of the decline wassmall, the weakness was widespread, with seven of the index's 11individual indicators flashing negative signals.   The small decline had been expected by analysts, who aredebating whether the economy's slowdown will worsen into arecession.   Traditionally, the signal for an economic downturn has beenthree consecutive monthly declines in the leading index. The index,however, rose in April, breaking the string of declines.   The forecasting gauge dropped in February and March, then rose0.6 percent in April before plunging 1.3 percent in May. That wasthe biggest one-month setback since late 1987 following the stockmarket crash in October of that year.   Economists note that the index is not infallible. The indexdeclined for five consecutive months in late 1987 and early 1988.But no recession followed and, in fact, economic growth acceleratedto its fastest pace in four years.   Some forecasters, however, now believe the economy is on theverge of a recession, even if the index has not yet dropped forthree consecutive months.   ``We are seeing a mild recession developing in the United Statesright now,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the New Yorkbrokerage firm of Merrill Lynch.   Steinberg said he believed forthcoming data would show that theeconomy went into a slump in the current July-September quarter andthe downturn will last until January.   But more optimistic forecasters believe the economy, whileentering a sluggish growth period, will be able to scrap by withoutan outright recession, defined as at least two consecutive negativequarters for the gross national product.   The Bush administration is even more optimistic, forecastingthat GNP growth, which weakened to an annual rate of 1.7 percent inthe April-June quarter, will rebound in the second half of the year.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of today'sreport: ``The weakness in the leading indicators over recent monthsis consistent with our view that economic growth is likely toremain relatively soft over the second half of 1989.''   ``It does show ... that the economy is softening in the lasthalf of the year. We think we'll continue to see the economy growbut at a more moderate pace than the 3.7 and 4.4 percent growth for1987 and 1988,'' Fitzwater said.   The index was held back in June by declines in seven of its 11components.   The biggest drag came from a decline in prices for rawmaterials. While that is good for the economy in that it signalslower inflationary pressures, it is considered a negative for theleading indicators because it can signal declining demand.   Other negative forces in June were a rise in weekly unemploymentclaims, a drop in building permits, a change in business deliverytimes, a drop in the length of the average work week, a fall inorders for consumer goods and weakness in the number of unfilledorders.   Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise instock prices making the biggest positive contribution. Otherpositive forces were a rise in consumer confidence, faster growthof the money supply and an increase in plant and equipment orders.   The various changes left the leading index at 143.5 percent ofits 1982 base of 100.   In the first six months of the year, the leading index hasfallen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent. By contrast, the indexrose by 4.5 percent in all of 1988.   After a year of pushing interest rates higher to fightinflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve reversed course in Juneand began lowering rates in an effort to keep the economy out of arecession.   Many forecasters believe the Fed will be able to successfullyengineer a so-called ``soft landing,'' in which growth slows enoughto dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the country intoa downturn.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that hebelieves the central bank can pull off its economic balancing act,but he said economists won't know for sure whether the country isout of the woods until well into 1990.   Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,said businesses have been able to keep their inventories in check,avoiding the type of dangerous growth in unsold inventories thatnormally precedes a recession.</TEXT></DOC>
