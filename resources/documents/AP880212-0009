Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid Wednesday, detaininghomeland President Lucas Mangope and several top Cabinet officialsfor 15 hours before South African soldiers and police rushed to thehomeland, rescuing the leaders and restoring them to power.   At least three soldiers and two civilians died in the uprising.   Bophuthatswana's Minister of Justice G. Godfrey Mothibe told anews conference that those arrested have been charged with hightreason and if convicted could be sentenced to death. He said theaccused were to appear in court Monday.   All those arrested in the coup attempt have been described asyoung troops, the most senior being a warrant officer.   During the coup rebel soldiers installed as head of state RockyMalebane-Metsing, leader of the opposition Progressive PeoplesParty.   Malebane-Metsing escaped capture and his whereabouts remainedunknown, officials said. Several unsubstantiated reports said hefled to nearby Botswana.   Warrant Officer M.T.F. Phiri, described by Mangope as one of thecoup leaders, was arrested Friday in Mmabatho, capital of thenominally independent homeland, officials said.   Bophuthatswana, which has a population of 1.7 million spreadover seven separate land blocks, is one of 10 tribal homelands inSouth Africa. About half of South Africa's 26 million blacks livein the homelands, none of which are recognized internationally.   Hennie Riekert, the homeland's defense minister, said SouthAfrican troops were to remain in Bophuthatswana but will not becomea ``permanent presence.''   Bophuthatswana's Foreign Minister Solomon Rathebe defended SouthAfrica's intervention.   ``The fact that ... the South African government (was invited)to assist in this drama is not anything new nor peculiar toBophuthatswana,'' Rathebe said. ``But why South Africa, one mightask? Because she is the only country with whom Bophuthatswanaenjoys diplomatic relations and has formal agreements.''   Mangope described the mutual defense treaty between the homelandand South Africa as ``similar to the NATO agreement,'' referring tothe Atlantic military alliance. He did not elaborate.   Asked about the causes of the coup, Mangope said, ``We grantedpeople freedom perhaps ... to the extent of planning a thing likethis.''   The uprising began around 2 a.m. Wednesday when rebel soldierstook Mangope and his top ministers from their homes to the nationalsports stadium.   On Wednesday evening, South African soldiers and police stormedthe stadium, rescuing Mangope and his Cabinet.   South African President P.W. Botha and three of his Cabinetministers flew to Mmabatho late Wednesday and met with Mangope, thehomeland's only president since it was declared independent in 1977.   The South African government has said, without producingevidence, that the outlawed African National Congress may be linkedto the coup.   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, dismissed the claims and saidSouth Africa's actions showed that it maintains tight control overthe homeland governments. The group seeks to topple the Pretoriagovernment.   The African National Congress and other anti-governmentorganizations consider the homelands part of an apartheid systemdesigned to fragment the black majority and deny them politicalrights in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
