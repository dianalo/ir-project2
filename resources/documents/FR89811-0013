Hamjian, (617) 565-3246;FTS 835-3246.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40656),EPA promulgated ambient air quality increments for NO<T2>2</T2> under the PSD regulations at 40 CFR Part 51 and 40 CFR Part52. The effective date promulgated for the NO<T2>2</T2> increments in Part 51 is October 17, 1989. However, the effectivedate promulgated for the NO<T2>2</T2> increments in Part 52 is November 19, 1990.This means that a State which adopted PSD regulations pursuant to 40 CFRPart 51, and had those regulations approved by EPA as revisions to itsState Implementation Plan (SIP) can adopt and implement requirements toprotect the NO<T2>2</T2> increments as early as October 17, 1989 (12 months from theOctober 17, 1988 promulgation date). Such a State may wait to revise thePSD regulations in its SIP for up to nine months after the effective date.The implementation of protection of the NO<T2>2</T2> increments could, therefore, occur as late as November 19, 1990,in such a State (25 months after the November 17, 1988 promulgation date).However, many States implement the requirements for PSD via authority delegatedto them by EPA to implement 40 CFR 52.21. EPA federally promulgated theprovisions of 40 CFR 52.21 into these States SIPs because they did notadopt and submit State regulations for incorporation into their SIPS pursuantto 40 CFR Part 51 requirements. These federal promulgations are codifiedin each State's respective subpart of 40 CFR Part 52 (in New Hampshire'scase at 40 CFR Part 52, Subpart EE_New Hampshire, andSection; 52.1529).Because the effective date of the NO<T2>2</T2> increments promulgated in 40 CFR 52.21 is November 19, 1990,States with PSD authority via delegation of the provisions of 40 CFR 52.21(e.g., New Hampshire) cannot, in general, implement protection of NO<T2>2</T2> increments until that date. In recognition that protection ofthe NO<T2>2</T2> increments is available as early as October 17, 1989, to a Statewhich adopted PSD regulations pursuant to Part 51 and had them incorporatedinto its SIP, EPA stated in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice promulgating the NO<T2>2</T2> increments that it will advance the general effective date ofPart 52 on a case-by-case basis pursuant to a State's request. On February 15, 1989, EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standardsissued a guidance memorandum entitled, ``Guidance on Early Delegation ofAuthority for the Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<T2>2</T2>) Increments Program.'' This memorandum outlines the requirementsthat a State must include in its amended delegation agreement and the procedurewhich EPA must follow to advance the general effective date of 40 CFR Part52 NO<T2>2</T2> increment regulations. The State must submit an amended delegationagreement to EPA for review and approval. The amended PSD delegation agreementmust_(1) Explain how the State plans to meet the new NO<T2>2</T2> increment requirements,(2) Demonstrate that the State has adequate legal authority under Statelaw to accept the delegation, (3) Address how the State will determine increment consumed since February8, 1988, and how it will correct possible exceedances, (4) Address how the State will track increment consumption in the future,and (5) Contain a stipulation by the appropriate State official that it doesnot intend to submit the necessary Part 51 State Implementation Plan (SIP)revisions within 21 months of the promulgation of the NO<T2>2</T2> increment regulations. These criteria and how they are met in New Hampshire's amended delegationagreement are detailed in a memorandum dated July 18, 1989 entitled, ``TechnicalSupport Document_Advancement of the Effective Date of the PSD NitrogenDioxide Increment Program in the State of New Hampshire at 40 CFR 52.1529.''Copies of this document are available, upon request, from the EPA RegionalOffice listed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. EPA has evaluatedNew Hampshire's request and has determined that the New Hampshire's May2, 1989 submittal meets all of the criteria in EPA's guidance. EPA is advancing the effective date of the NO<T2>2</T2> increments regulations in the State of New Hampshire withoutprior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendmentand anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 daysfrom the date of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice unless, within 30 days of its publication,notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdrawn thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective on October10, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is advancing the effective date of the PSD increment provisions forNO<T2>2</T2> in 40 CFR 52.21(b) through (w) from November 19, 1990 to October17, 1989 in the State of New Hampshire by amending 40 CFR part 52, subpartEE_New Hampshire, andSection;52.1529 to include the advanced date. Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by October 10, 1989. This action may not be challengedlater in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
