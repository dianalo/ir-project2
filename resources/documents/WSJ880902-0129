The company also would be interested in acquiring refining capacity in the U.S. to make a swap more attractive for a producer nation, an Elf official said. He declined to provide further details.    Elf's refining and marketing operations have incurred significant losses in recent years.    The Opec Listener, an energy information service, reported that Elf and Nigeria have moved into &quot;the serious discussion phase&quot; on a plan for Elf to swap about 30% of its world-wide refining assets for the equivalent value in Nigerian oil reserves. The report estimated that the transaction could be ready in two months and may be valued at as much as 800 million barrels of oil. </TEXT></DOC>
