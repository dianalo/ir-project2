DeAngelis, 202-343-6191.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Department's regulations publishedin 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart D, provide guidelines and procedures for implementingthe provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The rules require that all appealssubmitted by individuals regarding the denial of access to, or amendmentof their records are to be sent to the Department's Assistant Secretary_Policy,Budget and Administration. However, rules published by the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) in 5 CFR Part 297 require that any appeals filed by individualspertaining to OPM Governmentwide personnel records being maintained inany agency are to be filed directly with OPM. This rule will amend theDepartment's regulations to make them consistent with the OPM regulationsby providing that any appeals regarding personnel records under the jurisdictionof OPM are to be submitted directly to OPM. Also, other technical amendmentsare being made at various places throughout the regulations to improveformat and streamline the text.Because the regulations pertain primarily to internal Departmental guidelinesand procedures on the implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the changesbeing made will not have a substantial impact on the public. However, thepublic interest will be served by accelerated publication of the revisedrules so that current and up-to-date guidelines are available, not onlyfor Departmental officials to use in administering the provisions of thePrivacy Act, but also to inform members of the public and ensure that pertinentPrivacy Act appeals are handled in a proper manner. Also, the public interestwill be served by publishing these changes as final rules and eliminatingthe redundant <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication cost involved in a proposed rulemakingand public comment procedure. For the foregoing reasons, and since thesechanges are strictly administrative in nature and pertain to this agency'sprocedures and practices, the proposed rulemaking process is determinedto be unnecessary and impractical (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)).Since this document concerns only agency management, it is not a rule asdefined by E.O. 12291, and the Department of the Interior certifies thatthis document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>The author of this document is Mr. David R.
