The results were compared with the cell reactions obtainedafter X-rays (15 Gy) alone. The histological results and the morphometricdata show that the time course of cell damage changes individually withthe treatment applied. After radiation alone a cell oedema occurs withinsome days. After a combined treatment, however, a marked cell oedemaand cell lysis is already observed after 24 hours. An intensive shrinkingof the cell nuclei is found at day 6th, attended with pyknosis, karyolysisand cell fragments in the extended extracellular area. In comparisonwith radiation alone the processes of repair and repopulation in theR1H tissue are remarkably delayed after a combined treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
