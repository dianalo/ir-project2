The Concord Camera Corp. signed the unusual agreement Monday inHong Kong with the Wan Kong Economic Development Corp. of BaoanCounty.   The deal appears to be an attempt on China's part to help regainthe confidence of Western investors following the June crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead.   Many foreign business representatives fled the country during theturmoil, and the repercussions are believed to be having a seriousimpact on the nation's economy.   Under the agreement, Concord, based in Rahway, N.J., willsublease manufacturing space and supply labor to other corporationsthat want to operate in the newly formed industrial park in Baoan(prounced bow-ahn), in southern China's Guangdong province, about 15miles north of Hong Kong.   Jack Benun, chairman of Concord, declined to say how much thedeal was worth. He said his company had yet to determine how much itwould charge for space in the industrial park.   Over the weekend, the official China News Service quoted aChinese official from southern Hainan province as saying Chinawanted to proceed with another project that also allows a foreignfirm to lease space to foreign investors.   An official at the Hong Kong office of that firm, Kumagai Gumi,the Japanese construction giant, said Monday the firm had no commenton the Chinese report about the Yongpu Port.   In recent weeks, Hong Kong newspapers have said conservativeChinese officials, who have gained power as a result of thecrackdown, had criticized projects such as these. The officials werequoted as saying the projects were tantamount to selling China'ssovereignty to foreigners.   To increase confidence of potential investors, Benun said,Concord was planning to establish an insurance company that wouldguarantee assets on the leased property. But he said his firm hadn'tarranged the details yet.   Benun said he secured the deal during a visit of top officialsfrom Baoan County to his New Jersey home several weeks ago. Thebasis of the deal, he said, was Concord's six-year relationship withthe county.   Concord began producing cameras in Baoan in 1983 and has gonefrom occupying 10,000 square feet of space to its current productionfacilities of 240,000 square feet. It now employs 2,000 Chinese.   Benun said Concord makes approximately 4 million cameras a year,55 percent of which are sold in the United States and 45 percent inEurope and Asia.   Benun said he did not believe the recent unrest in China wouldaffect his investment.   ``It's our belief that with six years under our belt and with thelocal authorities having always delivered what they promised thereshould be no reason why anything should change,'' Benun said.   He said the space to be leased is currently fields and mountains.   Asked why the Chinese were willing to grant leasing rights to aforeign firm, Benun said he believed the Chinese saw the need forforeign help in marketing China.   ``It's like a company with a good product needing a littlemarketing help,'' he said. ``They believed that the management ofour company would tell the story better even than they could.''</TEXT></DOC>
