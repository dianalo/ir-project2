Blagg of the Legislationand Regulations Division, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service,1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224, Attention: CC:LR:T,(202) 566-3238 (not a toll-free call).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This document amends the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) to providerules under section 832 (b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Under section 832 (b) the gross income of a property and casualty insurancecompany includes its underwriting income. Underwriting income means premiumsearned on insurance contracts during the taxable year less losses incurredand expenses incurred. Section 832 (b) (5) provides that losses incurredare generally computed by deducting any increase in salvage and reinsurancerecoverable from paid losses, and to that result adding any increase inunpaid losses. (The Tax Reform Act of 1986 provides for the discountingof unpaid losses to reflect the time value of money. The discounting ofunpaid losses is expected to be the subject of another regulation project.That project is expected to address the proper treatment, under section846 (g)(2), of salvage and reinsurance attributable to unpaid losses, wheresuch amounts are not taken into account in determining the unpaid lossesshown in the annual statement filed by the taxpayer, and hence are notreflected in the taxpayer's ``undiscounted unpaid losses,'' as definedin section 846 (b) (1)).Although the statute clearly requires that paid losses be adjusted to takeinto account salvage recoverable (i.e., salvage not reduced to cash orcash equivalents), this adjustment generally has not been made. In 1947,the Internal Revenue Service promulgated regulations under section 832that provided for the exclusion from salvage recoverable of an item ifany state in which the taxpayer transacted business prohibited the taxpayerfrom reporting such an item for annual statement purposes. Several stateshave rules prohibiting the reporting of any salvage recoverable. Theserules reflect the generally conservative nature of state reporting measures,which are designed primarily to ensure the solvency of insurance companies.After the 1947 regulations were issued, many insurance companies begantransacting business in states that prohibited the reporting of salvagerecoverable. There remained, however, certain regional companies whichdid not transact business in such states. These companies were requiredto take salvage recoverable into account. Despite this disparity in treatment,the exclusion of salvage recoverable was upheld in <T3>Continental Insurance Co. v. United States, </T3>474 F.2d 661 (Ct.C1. 1973).The exclusion of salvage recoverable, while consistent with state regulatoryends, does not result in an accurate reflection of income for federal taxpurposes. Those purposes are best served by a close matching of incomeand expenses. The temporary regulations, therefore, amend andSection; 1.832-4(c) to require that paid losses be adjusted by all salvage recoverableattributable to such paid losses, regardless of how the salvage recoverableis reported for annual statement purposes.Section 1.832-4 (b) of the regulations provides that the taxpayer mustestablish ``that the part of the deduction for `losses incurred' whichrepresents unpaid losses at the close of the taxable year comprises onlyactual unpaid losses stated in amounts which, based upon the facts in eachcase and the company's experience with similar cases, can be said to representa fair and reasonable estimate of the amount the company will be requiredto pay.'' The temporary regulations amend andSection; 1.832-4 (b) of theregulations to clarify that, in making a ``fair and reasonable estimateof the amount the company will be required to pay,'' estimated recoverieson account of salvage and reinsurance attributable to unpaid losses mustbe taken into account.Thus, the temporary regulations provide that salvage and reinsurance recoverableattributable to paid losses must be taken into account under section 832(b) (5) (A) (i) as an adjustment to paid losses. Estimated recoveries onaccount of salvage and reinsurance attributable to unpaid losses must betaken into account in calculating the reserve for unpaid losses under section832 (b) (5) (A) (ii).In addition, the temporary regulations address the adjustments that mustbe made if the temporary regulations require an insurance company to changeits method of accounting for salvage and reinsurance. The temporary regulationsprovide that the fresh start of section 1023 (e) of the Tax Reform Actof 1986 is not applicable to such a change in accounting method.Finally, the temporary regulations make explicit that the term ``salvage''includes subrogation claims. The temporary regulations do not thereby changethe law concerning the meaning of salvage (as illustrated by <T3>Continental Insurance Co. v. United States, </T3>474 F.2d 661 (Ct.C1. 1973)), and no inference should be drawn with respect to any sectionof the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder that any changeis intended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that the temporaryrule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291 and that aregulatory impact analysis therefore is not required. A general noticeof proposed rulemaking is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 for temporary regulations.Accordingly, these temporary regulations do not constitute regulationssubject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these temporary regulations is William L. Blaggof the Legislation and Regulations Division of the Office of Chief Counsel,Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of theInternal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developingthe regulations, on matters of both substance and style.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 26 CFR 1.801-1 Through 1.832-6</ITAG>Income taxes, Insurance companies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to the Regulations</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 26, Chapter 1, SubchapterA, Part 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_[AMENDED]</ITAG><T4>Paragraph 1. </T4>The authority for Part 1 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>26 U.S.C. 7805.</ITAG><T4>Par. 2. </T4>Section 1.832-4 is redesignated as andSection; 1.832-4Tand amended by revising the heading, adding a new sentence at the end ofparagraph (a)(5), revising paragraphs (b) and (c), and adding paragraphs(d) and (e) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.832-4T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Gross income (temporary).</ITAG>(a) * * * (5) * * * See paragraph (b) of this section for rules relating to the treatmentof salvage and reinsurance in determining unpaid losses. (b) Every insurance company to which this section applies must be preparedto establish to the satisfaction of the district director that the partof the deduction for ``losses incurred'' which represents unpaid lossesat the close of the taxable year comprises only actual unpaid losses statedin amounts which, based upon the facts in each case and the company's experiencewith similiar cases, represent a fair and reasonable estimate of the amountthe company will be required to pay. Estimated recoveries on account ofsalvage and reinsurance attributable to unpaid losses must be taken intoaccount in the computation of unpaid losses. The amounts of such expectedrecoveries should be estimated based upon the facts in each case and thecompany's experience with similar cases. Amounts included in, or addedto, the estimates of unpaid losses which, in the opinion of the districtdirector, are in excess of the actual liability determined as providedin the preceding sentences will be disallowed as a deduction. The districtdirector may require any such insurance company to submit such detailedinformation with respect to its actual experience as is deemed necessaryto establish the reasonableness of the deduction for ``losses incurred.''(c) That part of the deduction for ``losses incurred'' which representsan adjustment to losses paid for salvage and reinsurance recoverable shallinclude all salvage in course of liquidation, and all reinsurance in processof collection not otherwise taken into account as a reduction of lossespaid, outstanding at the end of the taxable year. Salvage in course ofliquidation includes all property (other than cash or cash equivalents),real or personal, tangible or intangible. Such salvage in course of liquidationshall be taken into account to the extent of the value thereof at the endof the taxable year as determined from a fair and reasonable estimate basedupon either the facts in each case or the company's experience with similarcases. Cash or cash equivalents received during the taxable year with respectto items of salvage or reinsurance shall reduce losses paid during suchtaxable year. For purposes of this section the term ``salvage'' includessubrogation claims. (d)(1) The treatment of salvage and reinsurance is a method of accounting.Every insurance company to which this section applies that did not treatsalvage and reinsurance as provided in this section for the last taxableyear beginning before January 1, 1988, must change its method of accountingwith respect to salvage and reinsurance in the first taxable year beginningafter December 31, 1987. The change in method of accounting will resultin a section 481(a) adjustment. The fresh start provision of section 1023(e)of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 does not apply to the change in method ofaccounting required by this paragraph (d)(1). (2) In the case of any insurance company required by paragraph (d)(1) ofthis section to change its method of accounting for any taxable year, suchchange shall be treated as initiated by the taxpayer and made with theconsent of the Commissioner. (3) Any insurance company required to change its method of accounting underparagraph (d)(1) of this section shall take the required adjustment intoaccount as provided in applicable administrative procedures. (e) This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December31, 1987. In computing unpaid losses for taxable years beginning beforeJanuary 1, 1988, an insurance company to which this section applies isnot required to take into account estimated recoveries on account of salvageattributable to unpaid losses. In addition, in computing paid losses forsuch taxable years, an insurance company to which this section appliesis not required to take into account salvage recoverable if during suchtaxable years the inclusion of such salvage was prohibited by the lawsof a state in which the company transacted business.There is a need for immediate guidance with respect to the provisions containedin this Treasury decision. For this reason it is impracticable to issuethis Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under section (b)of section 553 of Title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effectivedate limitation of subsection (d) of that section.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
