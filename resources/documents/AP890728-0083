The proposals were made Tuesday when six Soviet officialsvisited Japan's National Space Development Agency, an agencyofficial said.   The delegates said the Soviet Union is ready to provide Japanwith technology to manufacture the Energia rocket, the world'slargest rocket that is capable of launching an 18-ton payload, orexport to Japan a rocket that can lift a two-ton payload, said theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The smaller rocket is priced at about $30 million, according tothe major economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun.   ``We were just amazed at the (Soviet) proposals,'' the agencyofficial said.   He said a Soviet delegation visited the government-financedorganization handling Japan's space development and rocketlaunching, but never made such ``business-oriented proposals.''   The latest Soviet offer is considered aimed at obtaininingforeign currency under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program ofsocial and economic reforms, the official said.   An official of the Science and Technology Agency, who also wouldnot allow his name to be used, said the Soviet delegates visitedhis agency July 17 but put forth no concrete terms regarding jointprojects.   Japan plans to develop an unmanned spacecraft in the next decadeand eventually wants to send its own astronauts into space aboardJapanese-made vessels.   Last month, the Space Development Commission, Japan's highestgovernment organ supervising Japanese aerospace programs, announceda 10-year plan that included development of the next-generation H-2rocket, capable of lifting a two-ton payload.   To date, Japan has had 19 successful launches with its N- andH-series rockets, each of them carrying up to 1,200 pounds.   It has yet to test a two-stage liquid combustion engine to beused in the H-2 rocket, scheduled to be launched in 1993.   The Soviet delegates, who came for the opening of a designexposition, also met July 18 with officials of the Society ofJapanese Aircraft Contractors, a group of 180 Japanese companiesengaged in space-related products manufacturing.   Western observers say it will not be long until Japan venturesinto the commercial arena to compete in space technology just as ithas in the automobile, computer and electronics markets.</TEXT></DOC>
