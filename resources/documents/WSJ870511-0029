Only a strong rise by the British pound would prompt the Bank of England to encourage a further fall in borrowing costs during the run-up to a June election, monetary officials and private analysts said.    The base-rate reduction to 9% from 9 1/2%, which was announced Friday and is effective today, put the benchmark lending fee at its lowest level since spring 1984. The central bank cleared the way for the base-rate cut Friday by reducing the rates at which it intervened in the money market.    The cut came as the pound surged following the Conservative Party's widespread successes in local elections last Thursday in England and Wales. The party's better-than-expected performance added to growing expectations that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today will announce the date for an early national election. Political commentators generally expect her to choose June 11.    The reduction in the United Kingdom's base rate was the second in two weeks and the fourth in two months. Falling interest rates are seen as a political boon for Mrs. Thatcher's reelection campaign because they bring down the cost of borrowing for consumers. However, representatives of building societies, the British equivalent of savings-and-loan associations, said Friday's base-rate cut probably wouldn't be sufficient to bring down politically sensitive mortgage rates from their current average level of 11.25%.    Analysts expect the central bank to now take a cautious approach on interest rates for economic and political reasons. John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, said the central bank will &quot;look through the political euphoria&quot; that spread over the financial markets on the strength of last week's municipal vote and recent opinion polls.    Money-supply figures for April, due May 20, likely will show exceptionally strong growth. The central bank has been concerned for some time about a potentially inflationary build-up of borrowing and liquidity in Britain's private sector.    The Bank of England also &quot;is very reluctant to be seen to be acting in a partisan fashion,&quot; said Alan Scowcroft, an analyst at the stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew. For this reason, Mr. Scowcroft said, the British central bank resisted market pressure for a base-rate cut until after last week's local election.    Indeed, analysts said the Bank of England gave a signal to the money markets Friday that it doesn't want further rate cuts in the near future. It reduced its long-term money-market dealing rate -- at which it lends to banks for between 64 and 91 days -- by only 5/16 percentage point. But it trimmed the cost of short-term funds by one-half point.    The Bank of England's signal to cut rates came after it had been forced to intervene heavily in early foreign-exchange market trading to prevent sterling from rising sharply against the West German mark.    But the move had clearly been anticipated in the City, London's financial district. Within minutes of the central bank's action, Barclays Bank PLC cut its base rate, and other leading banks followed.    The interest-rate decline and the election results prompted a buying spree on London's stock exchange. Also, yields on government bonds fell sharply, and money-market interest-rates also declined.    Some dealers said the drop in money-market interest rates to below 9% pointed to a further modest decline in the base rate, even though British authorities would want to keep interest rates steady in a politically volatile pre-election period. Dealers said the flow of international funds into sterling could be decisive for whether rates will fall again. Friday's surge in British government bond prices reflected buying by Japanese and continental European investors.    Sterling continued buoyant despite the fall in interest rates. The pound kept pressing upward against the three-mark level, and its trade-weighted value slipped only marginally.    The rate reduction was given a predictable welcome by business groups, although the Confederation of British Industry complained that British interest rates continued to be higher than those in key competitor nations. </TEXT></DOC>
