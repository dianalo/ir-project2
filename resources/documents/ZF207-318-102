(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hard drive manufacturers reboundandM;San Francisco -- Hard disk drive manufacturers are starting to rebound aftera rough 1988 if the most recent quarterly results of Quantum Corp., SeagateTechnology Inc. and Maxtor Corp. are indications.andM;All three posted revenue increases from both the preceding quarter and thesame period a year ago.andM;Quantum scored a dramatic turnaround in the fourth quarter of its 1989 fiscalyear.andP;  For the period ending March 31, revenues rose to $77.7 million, a gainof 84 percent compared with the same period a year ago and 51 percentcompared with the preceding quarter.andP;  Net income for the quarter soared to$6.92 million, or 81 cents per share, from a loss of $8.41 million, or 86cents per share, for the same quarter a year ago.andM;For the year, Quantum posted net income of $12.9 million, or $1.35 per share,compared with a loss of $3.22 million, or 35 cents per share last year.andO;Quantum announced a 3-for-2 stock split in May.andM;Stephen M. Berkley, Quantum president, attributed the company's numbers ofits successful conversion from 5.25-inch drives to 3.5-inch drives and relieffrom losses associated with the transition.andM;But Ron Elijiah, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens and Co. in SanFrancisco, noted heavy sales activity.andP;  &quot;Quantum got its contract with Applein March,&quot; he said, adding that Quantum expects Apple purchases to remainhigh through June.andM;while in sheer numbers Quantum's leap from loss to profit is impressive,Seagate's modest revenue increase of 5 percent is perhaps more significant.andM;For the third quarter ending March 31, the Scotts Valley, Calif., drive makerreported sales of $357 milllion, compared with $339 million for the sameperiod a year ago and $340 million for the preceding quarter.andP;  Net income wasdown to $21.5 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with $23.1 million, or46 cents per share for the same quarter a year ago.andM;Yet compared with the immediately preceding quarter, Seagate's net incomejumped 182 percent from $7.63 million, or 15 cents per share.andM;&quot;Seagate needed to make the transition from 5.25-inch drives to 3.5-inchdrives,&quot; said Michael Murphy of California Stock Technology Newsletter,adding that its manufacturing design was problematic.andP;  &quot;Seagate has made thetransition -- new drives, new design, new manufacturing quality.andP;  They're notgoing to be a disaster.&quot;andM;Elijiah said that Seagate's performance is notable because the companyincreased its sales even as it lost one of its biggest clients, Apple, toQuantum and Sony Corp.andP;  &quot;It means that non-Apple business is very strong,&quot;Elijiah said.andM;San Jose, Calif.-based Maxtor reported a slight increase in revenue for itsfourth quarter ending March 26, despite strong competition in thehigh-capacity hard drive market.andP;  Revenues rose to $97.7 million, up 14percent from $85.7 million for the same period a year ago, and up 7 percentfrom $91.4 million for the preceding quarter.andP;  Net income was $1.4 million,or 7 cents per share, down from $6.1 million, or 31 cents per share for theyear-earlier period, but up from $800,000, or 4 cents per share, for thepreceding quarter.andM;&quot;Maxtor has managed to hang in there,&quot; said Murphy.andP;  &quot;They're out of thewoods, even though their primary market, the workstation market, has lowervolume than the PC market.&quot;andM;Elijiah agreed.andP;  &quot;Maxtor's revenues are going up slowly, even with heavyprice wars in the 380-Mbyte market.&quot;andM;Overall, performance was attributed to a better-than-expected sales in thepersonal computer marketplace.andP;  &quot;Last year we predicted the business would beflat.andP;  Instead, it will be up 10 percent to 12 percent this year,&quot; Murphysaid.andM;Hard disk drive manufacturers are also benefitting from the volume stimulatedby lower-priced chips and from inventory-reducing cost controls implementedlast year.andP;  The forecast for the rest of the year is optimistic but cautious.andM;&quot;The big question mark is how much business Sony is going to take,&quot; Elijiahsaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
