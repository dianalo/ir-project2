No comments were received in response to the notice of filing. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance includeseveral acute studies, a 90-day feeding study with rats fed dosages of0, 5, 125, and 375 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) with a no-observable-effectlevel (NOEL) of 5 mg/kg/day; a 13-week feeding study with dogs fed dosagesof 0, 1.875, 37.5, and 187.5 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 37.5 mg/kg/day; a2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 3.75,112.5, and 1,125 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effects observed under theconditions of the study at dose levels up to 1,125 mg/kg/day (highest dosetested [HDT]) and a systemic NOEL of 3.75 mg/kg/day; a 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicitystudy with rats fed dosages of 0, 1.25, 25, and 125 mg/kg/day with no oncogeniceffects observed under the conditions of the study at dose levels up to125 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a systemic NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day; a 1-year feedingstudy with dogs fed dose levels of 0, 125, 18.75, and 187.5 mg/kg/day witha NOEL of 18.75 mg/kg/day; a two-generation reproduction study with ratsfed dosages of 0, 1.25, 25, and 125 mg/kg/day with no reproductive effectsobserved at 125 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day (HDT); a teratologystudy in rabbits fed dosages of 0, 30, 158, and 511 mg/kg/day with no teratogeniceffects occurring at 511 mg/kg/day and a maternal NOEL of 158 mg/kg/day;a teratology study in rats fed dosages of 0, 30, 159, and 725 mg/kg/daywith a teratogenic NOEL of 159 mg/kg/, a fetotoxic NOEL of 159 mg/kg/day,and a maternal NOEL greater than 725 mg/kg/day (HDT); and mutagenic studiesincluding a reverse mutation assay (not mutagenic in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>strains with and without activation), genemutation (no increase in mutation frequency seen at HDT of 7 mM, the limitof solubility), chromosomal aberration (negative for clastogenic responseat 5,000 mg/kg), and DNA synthesis/rat hepatocytes <T3>in vitro </T3>(material did not induce significant increase in unscheduledsynthesis [UDS] in primary cultures). The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on the 2-year rat feeding study(NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day and using a hundredfold safety factor) is calculatedto be 0.013 mg/kg/day. The TMRC from existing uses is 0.000073 mg/kg bodywt/day, which utilizes 0.57 percent of the ADI. The proposed toleranceswould increase the TMRC to 0.000107 mg/kg body wt/day, which would utilizea total of 0.83 percent of the ADI. No desirable data are lacking.The pesticide is useful for the purpose of this tolerance rule. The natureof the residue is adequately understood for the purpose of establishingthis tolerance. Adequate analytical methodology, high-pressure liquid chromatography,is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead-time fromestablishing this tolerance to publication, the enforcement methodologyis being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticideenforcement when requested by mail from:<ITAG tagnum="15">William Grosse, Chief, Information Services Branch, Program Managementand Support Division (H-7502C), Office of Pesticide Programs, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office location and telephone number: Rm. 223, CM andplusmin;2, 1921Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202.</ITAG>There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thechemical. There is no expectation of residue occurring in meat, milk, poultry,or eggs from this tolerance. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, it is concludedthat the tolerance established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will protectthe public health, and the tolerance is set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>file written objections with the Hearing Clerk(address above). Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate andspecify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the groundsfor the objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must statethe issues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objectionsare legally sufficient to justify the relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612)), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from the tolerance requirements do not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A certification statement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 27, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
