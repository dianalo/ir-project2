No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned today afterrepeated sniping by the Socialists, his main partner in the13-month-old coalition government.   De Mita turned in his resignation as head of Italy's 48thpostwar government to President Francesco Cossiga.   The president asked De Mita to stay on in a caretaker capacity.The political negotiations aimed at forming a new coalition couldtake weeks.   De Mita, a Christian Democrat, announced his resignation afteran urgent Cabinet meeting requested by his main political foe,Bettino Craxi, a former premier who leads the Socialists. Craxicalled the Cabinet meeting to discuss what he called a ``politicaland government crisis.''   Earlier today, in a closing speech at the Socialist conventionin Milan, Craxi said a ``political and procedural clarification''about the five-party coalition government was needed immediately.   The Socialists and Christian Democrats have been squabbling forweeks over a variety of issues, with Craxi and fellow party membersaccusing De Mita of failing to take a leadership role. Thegovernment, which took office in April 1988, also includes thesmall Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal Parties.   Craxi and his aides have made no secret that the Socialistleader would like o regain the premiership.   The Socialists are Italy's third largest party but have greatweight in forming a government. That is because no party has amajority and the Christian Democrats, who have dominated allgovernments since the end of World War II, refuse to bring theCommunists, Italy's second largest party, into the Cabinet.</TEXT></DOC>
