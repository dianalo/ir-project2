Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from blackgold, small patches of land increasingly are being turned intoalligator farms, with investors hoping to quintuple theirinvestments in short order.   ``Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raisedgators sold'' by 37 farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator researchcoordinator for Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.``That number is going to reach 60,000 quickly and could be up to100,000, certainly, within five years.''   That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped eachfall in carefully supervised hunts.   Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farmshave opened in the past two years, and ``We expect them to produce18,000 gators,'' Taylor said. The waiting list for permits for newfarms is about 100.   Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago nearSweetlake and expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. Hisfarm is state-of-the-art: automated cleaning, water-source heatpumps, carefully supervised diets.   The result is quicker growth at less cost. ``We have some are 5-6feet long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators thatare 26-30 inches.''   Skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length, and areused for luggage. Farm-raised gators are skinned at two years oldand about four feet long. Their hides are used for shoes, purses,belts and other smaller high-fashion accoutrements requiring smallerpatterns on the hides.   For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couplewindowless cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready toraise 1,000 gators a year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000to operate until the gators grew enough to sell. At current prices,1,000 four-foot hides would bring $148,000.   ``The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up totwo feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length,''Taylor said. Buildings must be able to hold a few inches of waterand be kept about 89 degrees.   The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests,paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of thehatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long. That's a carefullyresearched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of1.5 million wild alligators _ reached after the alligator was takenoff the endangered species list in the mid-1970s.   The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guardtheir eggs _ about the only time in their lives they show maternalinstincts.   No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. ``But everybody's got tolearn some time or another, if they want to get into farming.   ``Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement,would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nestsfrom the air. That's the only way to go: rent a helicopter and gofind them and pick them up.''   The success of farming ventures will almost certainly driveprices down, and there are risks any time a market depends onfashion or something volatile, he said. ``I don't think the bottomwill fall out of the price. I don't think they'll go to $2 a foot.But it certainly could go to half of what it is now.''   Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welderwho now devotes full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor'sanalysis. ``A lot of these farms, you'll see what happens. Pricesare good right now, but with all these hides coming on the market,it's going to have to go down.''   But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because hisexpenses are low. ``Look at it this way, you've got an electricitybill of $500 a month to raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150a month to raise 12,000.''   His major problem is finding enough nutria _ small water rodents_ to feed the gators. Nutria often are dyed like beaver, and Jonessaid, ``The price of skins is so low, right now, that you can't getall you want. Last year I got 40,000 pounds, and I could have used140,000.''   He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligatorsdon't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish givesalligators gout.</TEXT></DOC>
