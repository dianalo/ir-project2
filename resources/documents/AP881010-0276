Gold prices rose, boosted by a jump in oil prices. RepublicNational Bank of New York, which traded in spite of a bank holiday,said gold was bid at $408.75 as of the close of trading at 2:30p.m. EDT, up from $403.30 an ounce as of Friday at 4 p.m.   Traders described the dollar's decline as a continuation of thetrend that began Friday, when the Labor Department reported asmaller-than-expected increase in U.S. non-farm jobs in September.   Slower economic growth means flat or lower interest rates, whichwould make dollar-denominated investments less attractive toforeign investors.   Some traders were also concerned that the government's reportdue Thursday on the August trade deficit would hurt the dollar.   But trading was so light Monday that some major traders mightnot regard the dollar's drop as a reliable indicator of itsunderlying trend, said Jack Adkins, a currency analyst for RefcoPartners Ltd. in Chicago.   Those trading in the United States were mainly brokerage houses,other financial firms, and banks that kept their currency-tradingoperations open in spite of the holiday.   Monday's thin trading turned the attention of dealers to theBritish pound, which was boosted by a pledge Sunday from Chancellorof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson to keep interest rates high to curbinflation.
