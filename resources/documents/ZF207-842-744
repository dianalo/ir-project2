U.S.andP;  Memoryofficials hope to restore America's independence in advanced memory chips andcomponents, while making a profit.andM;Before this happy day of profitability dawns, the consortium's members mustkick in substantial dollars, which the Defense Department will match.andP;  U.S.andO;Memory Inc. -- which includes IBM Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., NCR Corp.,andO;Apple Computer Inc., Unisys Corp., Tandem Computers Inc. and Sun MicrosystemsInc. -- also expects to be exempted from antitrust laws, as have beenSematech, the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp. and the SoftwareProductivity Consortium.andM;A group of large U.S.andP;  computer companies led by IBM also has launched theComputer Systems Policy Project (CSPP).andP;  Its mission is to rebalance thegovernment's treatment of segments of the information technology industry.andO;Its sponsors presumably hope to prevent discriminatory trade protection.andM;Does the information technology industry need all these joint efforts?andP;  Theapproach is patterned on the Japanese, who nurtured their high-tech industryfrom nothing in the 1950s to world-class status today.andP;  But even the Japanesehave failed at times.andM;Why do we need U.S.andP;  Memory when Texas Instruments and Motorola seem capableof staying at the leading edge of the technology?andP;  Why do we need anotherquasi-lobbying group, the CSPP, when the computer and semiconductorindustries already have several trade associations?andM;In August the specter arose of direct government involvement in themuch-feared supercomputer crisis.andP;  Sen.andP;  Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) introduced theNational High-Performance Computer Technology Act of 1989.andP;  The demise ofControl Data Corp.'s supercomputer effort and NEC Corp.'s announcement of thefastest supercomputer have alarmed some in defense and science who feardependence on Japan for a product with strategic implications.andM;Will an infusion of $1.75 billion over five years provide a safety netagainst the Japanese?andP;  Will Al Gore's money be spent any better than thatspent by the Housing and Urban Development Department?andM;Government programs aimed at relatively mundane problems have not worked.andO;Why should one believe that government subsidies, with their inevitablerules, will work with ultra-sophisticated supercomputers?andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
