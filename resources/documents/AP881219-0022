They have never worked in history.''   Several of OPEC's larger members have new incentives to produceoil, rather than comply with last month's decision by the cartel tolimit production to 18.5 million barrels a day.   Herrington cited the following examples:   _Venezuela has a major stake in the Citgo chain of servicestations and despite previous support of OPEC, the South Americannation's ``future is here, not with OPEC.''   _Saudi Arabia is buying service stations and a refinery fromTexaco ``and that's a major change.''   _``We've got two countries who have been at war for eight years(Iran and Iraq) with 40 to 50 billion dollars in war debt, and areconstruction budget that is going to be horrendous, with one thingto sell _ oil.''   Herrington contends that ownership of U.S. distributionfacilities by overseas producers should be welcomed because of theincentives it gives producers to bring oil to market.   ``It's good for the United States and it's good for Saudi Arabia.No. 1, it's a guaranteed market for Saudi Arabia and No. 2, it's aguaranteed supply for us,'' Herrington said.   Those who fear a resumption of the oil shocks of the 1970s don'trealize ``we live in a fundamentally different world,'' he said.   In the first half of 1986, the oil industry was devastated by thecollapse of crude oil from above $27 a barrel to less than $12(measured by average refiner cost). Half the 1,980 exploration rigsactive in 1985 were idled and 120,000 out of 585,000 exploration andproduction jobs vanished.   Crude oil now sells for about $15 a barrel. Imports have risenfrom less than 30 percent of U.S. consumption in 1985 to more than40 percent now. At the same time, U.S. production has fallen by amillion barrels of crude a day to a little more than 8 millionbarrels.   While U.S. producers of crude oil have pleaded for tradeprotection, Herrington and President Reagan maintained that quotasor tariffs would harm the U.S. economy more than they would help theoil industry.   A tariff might be politically impossible anyway because of thedemands for exemptions by Northeast consumers, Mexico and thepetrochemical industry plus the mandatory exemption for Canada underthe free-trade agreement, Herrington said.   Herrington said ``cooperation with OPEC is not the solution,''although he said he understood why Texas, Alaska and Louisiana sentobservers to the OPEC meeting.   ``This is not an industry we can allow to go by the boards,''Herrington said. He said he did not know just how big an industrythe nation should try to preserve, but, ``I think it should be alean, mean, efficient industrial part of our economy, which I thinkit is today.''   On other issues, Herrington said the U.S. economy has to becomemore energy-efficient.   The nation has made big gains in efficiency. The economy in 1987was 40 percent larger than it was in 1973, but it used only 2percent more energy.   However, the gains are slowing down. West Germany and Japan useenergy with twice the efficiency of the United States.   ``That's got to change. Now, is that the federal government'sjob?'' Herrington said. ``My position is, a lot of these problemsare tax policy questions'' that will yield to ``tried and true'' taxincentives.   Advocacy groups have blasted Herrington and his predecessorsunder Reagan for sharply curtailing spending on conservation,efficiency and renewable sources of energy. Herrington dismisses thecriticisms.   ``Are we spending enough money? I think we are. It's true we'renot building the giant wind machines for $10 million any more, likeMod 2 and Mod 3, that we're reselling years later for $13,000.''   As for an environmentalist favorite, higher taxes on gasoline todiscourage consumption, Herrington admitted that a big increasewould do the job but said ``I stand foursquare with the president''against more taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
