It got a fight, all right: Mr. Tait hired a lawyer and filed a civil rights suit.    Last month, an Anchorage Superior Court judge, citing Alaska's protection of free speech and the U.S. Constitution's equal protection provisions, ruled that the bar can't stop Mr. Tait and other Angels from wearing their jackets.    The bar had argued that the presence of clearly identifiable Hell's Angels occasionally incited the braver -- or dumber -- of its patrons to take a swing at them, causing, as you might imagine, a considerable ruckus. Judge Joan M. Katz ruled that the saloon's argument was analagous to asking blacks to &quot;shed their skins&quot; because their presence riled a bunch of bigots.    The Angels thought this was just great. Three members of the motorcycle gang -- freshly shaven and sporting brand-new Hell's Angels jackets -- even appeared in court, politely smiling through the judge's decision.    &quot;Isn't that incredible?&quot; says Rex Butler, lawyer for the Crazy Horse. &quot;At the bar, these are the scraggliest guys in the world. Then they come to court starched and ironed.&quot; He has appealed the case to the state Supreme Court.    &quot;This is a victory for associational free speech,&quot; says the Angels' lawyer, Shawn Holliday. &quot;You know what this bar is, don't you? A nude dancing place.&quot; He argued in court that a bar offering gyrating naked dancers -- and the various &quot;associational activities&quot; such dancing encourages -- can't exactly claim that wearing a Hell's Angels jacket is unduly disruptive.    The Crazy Horse, which already has a sign on the door denying entrance to &quot;pimps, prostitutes and pushers,&quot; says it has nothing against the Hell's Angels themselves. It just doesn't approve of the group's &quot;colors&quot;: the winged skull emblem that appears on the back of the jackets.    Mr. Butler says the real issue is property rights. Fights, no matter who starts them, often require calls to the police, and visits by the police may become blots against the bar's record when it renews its liquor license.    &quot;Look, we already confiscate the Angels' weapons at the door,&quot; says Mr. Butler, noting that in Alaska it is legal to carry guns or knives as long as they aren't concealed. </TEXT></DOC>
