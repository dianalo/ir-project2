(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Applications for licenses to huntalligators are available in Florida for the first time since 1962,when the practice was outlawed, an official said Monday.   Dennis David, alligator program coordinator for the Florida Gameand Fresh Water Commission, said 15,000 applications weredistributed to the agency's regional offices last Wednesday andwill be available through July 15. The maximum number of licensesto be awarded _ probably about 230 _ will be determined at thecommission's July 15 meeting in Ocala, he said.   David said the alligator-hunting season would be restricted tospecific areas, and hunters will have a limit of 15 alligatorsmeasuring at least four feet long.   ``We've been conducting research on hunting since 1981,evaluating the impact on the alligator population,'' said David.   Gator hunting was banned because alligators' numbers weredwindling. But David said the alligator population in Florida hasdoubled since 1973 to its present total of about 1 million.   ``It's kind of a first step for the commission to allow publicharvest of alligators in the state,'' added David. ``We hope to seethe economic value of alligators provide an economic incentive topreserve Florida's wetlands.   ``You're not going to stop condominiums from going in because ofalligator hunts, but it adds another reason to preserve wetlandhabitats in the state.''   Alligator hides brought a record $42.72 a linear foot inFebruary, said David. Those hides were sold by trappers who arelicensed under another program to catch and kill ``nuisance''gators that get too close to homes or people. The trappers alsosell alligator meat, mostly from the tail, to restaurants.   Public interest in the hunt increased after a 4-year-old girlwas killed by an alligator in a neighborhood lake in SouthwestFlorida earlier this month. It was the sixth fatal attack by analligator on a human since the state began keeping such records in1946.   ``The number of attacks has remained relatively constant inspite of the fact that we've had a dramatic increase in the numberof alligators and number of people in Florida,'' said David. ``Ournuisance alligator program removes about 3,000 alligators a year inthe state.''</TEXT></DOC>
