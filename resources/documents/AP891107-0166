Bush's comments at a news conference came a day after U.S.officials announced Iran would receive $567 million, a portion ofthe money frozen by Washington after radical students stormed theAmerican Embassy in Tehran in 1979.   Bush said he didn't know if the release of the money wouldaffect the eight Americans.   ``I carry the fate of the hostages with me every single day,''he said.   Bush administration officials repeatedly have rejected linkingthe hostages' fate to the assets on the grounds the United Statesdoes not negotiate for captives.   Bush has appealed to pro-Iranian Moslems holding the hostages tofree them on humanitarian grounds.   But Bush said he hoped actions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunalin The Hague, a body established in 1981 to iron out financialclaims and counter-claims between the two countries, could help thehostages.   ``I think they (the Iranians) have made some positivestatements, but I don't know whether it will work that way or not.I hope that they will do what they can to influence those who holdthese hostages.''   Nevertheless, Bush said the administration had run into ``deadends'' following certain ``rabbit trails'' in behind-the-scenesefforts to free the hostages.   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-heldhostage in Lebanon, called the release of the $567 million ``damnedgood news.''   Anderson, the Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was captured in March 1985.   ``I would expect the ball is in the court'' of Iranian PresidentAli Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mrs. Say said.   Last month, Rafsanjani offered to help get the Western hostagesfreed if the United States released frozen assets or helped settlethe cases of three Iranians captured by Christian Lebanesemilitiamen in 1982.   Shireen Hunter, an expert on Iranian affairs at the Center forStrategic and International Studies, a think tank, cautionedagainst reading too much into the tribunal actions' in The Hague.   ``It isn't really a quid pro quo,'' she said of links betweenthe hostages and the assets. Nevertheless, the tribunal's actionsare another step in ``confidence-building or mistrust-reducing''between Tehran and Washington, she said.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the $567 millionwas the amount transferred to Iran after Iran satisfied debts toAmerican banks over the last several months. The money came from anaccount that contained about $800 million.   The remainder, about $243 million, was put in a security accountthat will be used to pay off others claims to Americans. Thesecurity account must contain a minimum of $500 million at alltimes, officials said.   The agreement was worked out in party by Abraham Sofaer, theState Department's legal adviser who met with Iranian officials inThe Hague on Nov. 2 and 3, Boucher said.   The U.S.-Iranian claims commission was set up in 1981 as part ofthe arrangement that led to the release of American hostages heldfor 444 days in Tehran after seizure of the U.S. Embassy bymilitants.   There are several other claims outstanding, including Iran'sdemand for compensation for military equipment purchased before the1979 Islamic revolution but never delivered.   The United States transferred $9.9 billion in frozen assets tothe jurisdiction of the claims tribunal in 1981. Before the banks'settlement this month, some $3.8 billion had been transferred toIran.</TEXT></DOC>
