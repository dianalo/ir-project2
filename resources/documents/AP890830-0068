But Deputy Police Chief Glenn Levant called a news conferenceTuesday to clear up the controversy, saying it turns out to be``much ado about nothing.''   ``The only thing I can surmise is the school board was notpresented all of the facts. There's nothing political about drugabuse,'' Levant said.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mr. Blackwell, the celebrity fashioncritic known for his annual, acerbic worst-dressed list, is glad tosee the Beverly Hills Police Department recognized for its nattiness.   The department won a special achievement award in a nationalbest-dressed police contest sponsored by the National Association ofUniform Manufacturers.   ``I think it's because in Beverly Hills there is a greater senseof grooming,'' Blackwell said. ``There are never any smudges. Theyare opulently conspicuous in Beverly Hills.   ``Actually, it is almost like a private army in a separatecountry there in Beverly Hills.''   Top honors in cities with fewer than 200 officers went to theHickory, N.C., Police Department.   Although Beverly Hills officers wear the standard Navy blueuniform, Lt. Robert Curtis said an attention to detail gives them anappearance edge. For example, rather than black plastic buttons,Beverly Hills cops use brass ones.</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn.

Starr has sued to keep the album under wraps, saying he wassuffering from alcoholism when it was recorded, and that therecordings are not up to his standards.
