John Troelstrup, a Chicago attorney representing at least one ofthe traders subpoenaed, told The Associated Press he understood thegrand jury would meet today and Wednesday.   The New York Times reported today that at least a dozen moresubpoenas were delivered to Chicago traders Monday and some peoplecould appear today before a grand jury.   The Chicago Sun-Times reported that unidentified sources said theFBI has asked the Internal Revenue Service to conduct ``net worth''investigations of some brokers and traders suspected of evadinglarge amounts of taxes.   The Sun-Times also said the suspects are believed to befrantically trying to shift assets to relatives and businessassociates to hide unreported profits.   U.S. law enforcement officials are investigating allegations thatas many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customersout of millions of dollars on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange andthe Chicago Board of Trade.   Since last week's revelations, FBI agents and U.S. prosecutors inChicago have said nothing for the record, but on Monday inWashington, Ms. Gramm acknowledged her agency has been involved inthe investigation from the outset.   Ms. Gramm declined to say whether the CFTC simply had beeninformed of the probe or had assigned personnel to it from thestart. Nor would she say whether the agency knew that undercover FBIagents were operating on the floors of the exchanges and whetherCFTC records have been subpoenaed.   Asked if the revelations should shake investor confidence in thefutures markets, Ms. Gramm said: ``The fact that we bring cases ...to root out fraud and abuse is an example of why people should beconfident in our ability to police the markets.''   FBI agents posing as traders recorded conversations about thealleged fraud at the exchanges, and the government has subpoenaedtraders and trading records dating back to Jan. 1, 1983.   The investigation has raised jitters among many traders andsparked a rash of seat sales on the major exchanges. Six more seatswere sold on both exchanges by the close of business Monday,bringing to 32 the total number sold since the probe went publicThursday.   The Merc's board of governors issued a letter urging traders``not to be driven to irrational or self-destructive behavior by theadverse publicity.''   ``Our own internal compliance department had already focused onmany of the same practices that appear to be central to the federalinvestigation,'' the letter read.   ``We will deal harshly with violators. We stand ready to reviserules and enforce procedures where necessary.''   The Chicago Tribune reported today that the FBI paid between $1million and $2 million to secretly buy three seats on the exchanges,lease a fourth seat, deposit $200,000 with firms that processed theagents' trades and stake the agents to trading capital.</TEXT></DOC>
