Hugo Steersma, general manager in New York of RabobankNederland of Utrecht, a Dutch Bank, said the bank had lent$100 million of the more than $600 million in U.S.-backedloans to the Soviets made by European banks in the fiscalyear ending Sept. 30.   Iva Millas, a vice president in New York of the BanqueNationale de Paris, said it was lending $300 million. TheU.S. branch of U.K.-based Barclays Bank said it had lent $150million.   Banque Indosuez, another French bank, is lending about $60million, said Jean-Claude Gruffat, general manager ofIndosuez's New York branch.   No Japanese banks were reported involved in the graindeals. The Japanese government has been reluctant to provideaid to the Soviet Union because of a territorial disputesince World War II.   The U.S. government will guarantee another $900 million inloans by European banks to the Soviet Union in the currentfiscal year.   John Haseltine, an analyst for the Institute ofInternational Finance, said the absence of U.S. lenders wasdue at least in part to mistrust of the political situationin the Soviet Union. The institute represents major banksaround the world.   Rabobank's Mr. Steersma said that U.S. banks had made loanbids that weren't accepted.   The Soviet Union's 15 republics and the central governmentin Moscow are still disputing how to divide up financialresponsibilities. Mr. Haseltine suggested that U.S. banks arealso especially cautious these days because of the uncertainstate of the U.S. banking system.   President Bush announced in June that the U.S. governmentwould guarantee $1.5 billion of loans from private banks forthe Soviet grain purchases. The government subsidizes thesales at the rates of $51.01 a metric ton.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the presidentdecided that the Soviets were creditworthy and would repaythe loans. If the Soviets don't repay the loans, the U.S.taxpayer will be responsible for 98% of the loan principaland part of the interest.   The president has also permitted the U.S. government'sExport-Import Bank to guarantee $300 million worth of loansto the Soviets to buy U.S. industrial goods. Lenders can beU.S. or foreign banks.   Loans for $51.1 million have been processed under thatprogram.</TEXT></DOC>
