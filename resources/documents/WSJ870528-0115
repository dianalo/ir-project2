These attitudes emerge from a survey released yesterday by the Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan group of specialists charged with helping Congress cope with complex scientific and technological issues. To investigate public sentiment on emerging biotechnology developments, OTA commissioned Louis Harris andamp; Associates to put a wide range of questions to a large national sample. Last November, 1,273 people were polled.    OTA said: &quot;The survey finds that while the public expresses concern about genetic engineering in the abstract, it approves nearly every specific environmental or therapeutic application. And, while Americans find the end products of biotechnology attractive, they are sufficiently concerned about potential risks, that a majority believes strict regulation is necessary&quot; -- either by government agency or some nongovernment scientific group.    In general, 62% of the respondents expect the benefits of continued scientific and technological innovation to outweigh the potential risks. Only 28% think the reverse.    Though surprisingly large numbers of the sample described themselves as knowledgeable or concerned about biotechnology, the survey results showed, as OTA suggested, considerable ambivalence and contradictions.    For example, one-fourth of the respondents said society might be better off if it didn't know how to alter human cells genetically, and 42% believed it morally wrong to change the genetic makeup of human cells, &quot;regardless of the purpose.&quot; Nonetheless, large majorities -- including a majority of those expressing moral doubts -- endorsed gene therapy to cure a usually fatal genetic disease, to reduce the risk of developing one in later life, or to prevent children from inheriting one.    Again, while 52% said they consider it likely that genetically engineered products &quot;will represent a serious danger to people or the environment,&quot; a whopping 82% said they would favor environmental applications of these organisms on a small-scale, experimental basis to increase agricultural productivity or clean up environmental pollutants.    Further, two-thirds of the respondents said that if there were no direct risk to humans and only remote environmental risk, they would favor or at least not object even if the test were carried out in their own community.    But a 53% majority opposed allowing commercial firms to apply genetically altered organisms on a large scale, even if environmental risks were judged to be very small.    Over three-fourths of those surveyed agreed with the statement that &quot;the potential danger from genetically altered cells and microbes is so great that strict regulations are necessary,&quot; with 37% favoring regulation by a government agency and 29% by some scientific group. At the same time, however, university scientists, public health officials and environmental groups were all ranked ahead of federal agencies in credibility on biotechnology issues.    Asked whether they would give greater credence to environmentalist warnings of risk in genetically altered organisms or federal agency assurances of safety, the survey sample opted for the environmentalists by a better than 2-to-1 margin. </TEXT></DOC>
