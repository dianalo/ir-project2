The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading EconomicIndicators rose a modest 0.2 percent in July after registering nogain in June and plunging by 1.3 percent in May, the biggest dropsince late 1987 following the stock market crash.   The small July increase in the index was in line withexpectations of many analysts, who believe growth should continue ata moderate pace for the rest of the year.   That view is a sharp reversal of the prevalent opinion just amonth ago when weakness in the leading index and a variety of othergovernment statistics had raised fears that the economy was about totopple into a recession.   But since that time, the government has basically rewritteneconomic history, issuing various revisions showing that everythingfrom employment growth to consumer spending were stronger thanoriginally believed.   ``The image we had of an economy on the verge of a recession hasbeen changed by these revisions,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senioreconomist at the New York brokerage firm of Merrill Lynch.   Economists are not forecasting that the country is on the vergeof boom times, but they are now much more confident that the longestpeacetime recovery in U.S. history, currently in its seventh year,should be able to continue for some time to come.   The leading index is a compilation of 11 forward-pointingbusiness statistics designed to forecast economic performance threeto nine months down the road.   In July, five of the economic statistics showed signs ofincreasing strength, five flashed weak signals and one was unchanged.   The biggest source of strength was a pickup in growth in thenation's money supply. The Federal Reserve, which had beenrestraining monetary growth in an effort to fight inflationarypressures, has now switched course and over the past two months hasbeen loosening credit conditions.   Economists believe this change in Fed policy has already providedmomentum for the economy in such key sectors as housing construction.   Other sources of strength in July were a jump in consumerconfidence, a rise in stock prices, an increase in plant andequipment orders and an increase in the backlog of unfilledmanufacturing orders.   Five indicators held back the overall increase. The biggestnegative factor was a decline in raw materials prices. While thisindicated lessening inflationary pressures, it is read as a negativefor the index because it can also signal lower demand. Othernegative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods, anincrease in weekly unemployment claims, a fall in building permitsand changes in business delivery times.   One indicator, the length of the work week, showed no change fromJune to July   The various changes left the index at 144.0 percent of its 1982base of 100.   The Bush administration is projecting that the overall economywill grow at an annual rate of 2.9 percent this year. That growthtarget can be achieved even if the economy slows in the second halfof the year from the 3.2 percent annual rate of first six months of1989.   Many analysts are looking for a modest slowing of growth, butnothing close to a recession.   David Berson said he expected the rate of growth would slowslightly in the July-September quarter primarily because autocompanies are working to reduce a high inventory of unsold cars. Buthe said he expected the year would end on a strong note onceinventories are trimmed.</TEXT></DOC>
