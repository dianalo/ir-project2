The Applicant believes that it is excluded from the definition of investmentcompany under section 3(b)(1) of the Act. Because uncertainty exists, however,as to whether foreign financial institutions which carry out operationssimilar to the Applicant's are ``investment companies,'' the Applicantis filing this application under section 6(c) of the Act.2. Applicant's business and operations exhibit many of the characteristicsof domestic financial institutions which are excluded from the definitionof investment company pursuant to section 3(c)(3) of the Act, which excludesany ``savings and loan association, building and loan association, cooperativebank * * * or similar institution.''3. A primary aspect of the Applicant's business is making loans and acceptingdeposits. The Applicant is subject to regulation and supervision underthe Incorporating Act and by various Canadian governmental authorities,such as securities commissions and insurance deposit boards. Furthermore,each depositor of the Applicant is accorded deposit insurance protectionsimilar to that accorded a depositor of a Chartered Bank.4. The Applicant is different from an investment company in purpose, functionand role in the economy and is subject to regulation by Canadian laws sufficientto protect investors.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions to the Applicant's Requested Relief</ITAG>The Applicant consents to any order granting the requested relief beingexpressly conditioned upon compliance with the undertakings and representationsset forth herein and in the application and upon the Applicant issuingand selling the Commercial Paper Notes and Other Debt Securities in theUnited States only so long as:1.
