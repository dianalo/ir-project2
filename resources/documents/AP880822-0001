Soldiers wearing helmets and carrying automatic rifles stoppedabout 150 opposition representatives late Sunday night fromentering a room at the Legislative Palace where millions of ballotsare being held.   The deputies-elect said the ballots would prove oppositioncharges that the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, orPRI, rigged the election. The army is required to guard the ballotsuntil the election is certified.   The air of antagonism at the Chamber of Deputies, now sitting asan electoral college, raised the question of whether the reviewwill be finished in time for the president to swear in a newchamber by the constitutional deadline.   The PRI holds a slim plurality in the chamber. Once the chamberfinishes ratifying 26 disputed congressional races, it is supposedto move on to the presidential election.   By custom, the outgoing chief executive formally introduces hissuccessor to the nation on Sept. 1 during his finalstate-of-the-union address. Failure to do so would be anembarrassing breach of tradition, even though the new president isnot sworn in until Dec. 1.   Missing the deadline could ``interrupt the constitutional orderand put the nation on the threshold of a coup d'etat'' FranciscoCardenas, one of Mexico's best-known political commentators, saidMonday in the independent daily El Universal.   The confrontation between soldiers and deputies was the latestin a series of incidents that marked the review of an electionwhich produced unprecedented opposition gains. It was front-pagenews throughout Mexico.   Before dawn on Monday, a few hours after the incident, theleader of the PRI delegation, Guillermo Jimenez, told reporters``there will be a chamber on time'' despite the conflict.   The showdown prompted two prominent Roman Catholic clergymen toissue statements. The archbishops of Zacatecas, Javier LozanoBarragan, and of Chihuahua, Disan Vazquez, said they hoped commonsense would prevail and the electoral college would finish by Sept.1.   The PRI-dominated Federal Election Commission has said the PRIcandidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, won with 50.36 percent of thevote.   Mexican presidents serve single, six-year terms beginning onDec. 1. The PRI has won every presidential election since it wascreated in 1929.   Lucia Santes, a leader of the opposition Democratic Frontcoalition party in southeastern Tabasco state, meanwhile said shehad switched to the PRI. She said she had been the object of ``lowblows, envy and rancor'' and that the PRI ``represents the realoption for change.''   The Santes defection was a blow to supporters of CuauhtemocCardenas, presidential candidate for the Democratic Front, thelargest opposition party, who ran strongly in Tabasco. Cardenascame in second place in presidential voting but maintains that afair count would make him the winner.   Late Monday, Cardenas filed criminal charges against ManuelBartlett Diaz, president of the Federal Election Commission, andFernando Elias Calles, the technical secretary, accusing them ofviolating the electoral code by not releasing individual resultsfrom nearly half of the 55,000 voting stations nationwide.   Bartlett also is interior minister.   ``We asked that the (vote) information be made known and thatthe authorities fulfill their responsibility,'' Cardenas said.   He brought charges against the two earlier this month but wastold he needed to file personally with the federal attorneygeneral's office.</TEXT></DOC>
