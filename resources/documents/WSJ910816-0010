If the companies reach agreement as soon as expected, itwill help crack open a bit further the Japanese chip market,which has been difficult for foreign companies to penetrate.The talks with Sony Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd.,first reported earlier this month in Electronic EngineeringTimes, come as the U.S. and Japan are putting in place a newtrade agreement aimed at boosting foreign semiconductor salesin Japan.</LP><TEXT>   A Texas Instruments agreement wouldn't appear to guaranteethe Dallas-based company any sales, and any major payoffwould be years away, as the HDTV market is just beginning --the first major broadcasting in Japan is currently scheduledto begin in November.   But the move is significant because it marks a U.S.maker's entry at the relatively early stages of developmentin what could be a large consumer-electronics market.   &quot;We won't see a significant HDTV business in the next twoto three years,&quot; Masataka Hayashida, Texas Instruments'manager coordinating strategies in consumer-electronicschips, said in an interview last month before the most recentnegotiations were disclosed. &quot;But there will be a lot ofdemand in the future. This will pay off.&quot;   Texas Instruments has been developing HDTV chips on itsown since 1989, when it acquired a basic license on thetechnology for the Japanese system.   A major barrier for foreign companies to sellingsemiconductors and other components in Japan has been thecountry's very tight supplier network. Japaneseconsumer-electronics makers have tended to work closely withtheir longtime suppliers to design parts for TVs and otherproducts, sometimes years in advance. U.S. competitors oftendidn't even find out about the product until long after thespecifications had been set, making it difficult to competeagainst insiders.   Such a contract, then, would essentially make TexasInstruments an insider with status equal to three of Japan'sleading electronics concerns.   Last month, LSI Logic Corp. of Milpitas, Calif., announcedit had reached a similar agreement with Sanyo Electric Co.Meanwhile, Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. also are workingtogether on HDTV chips. The U.S. Semiconductor IndustryAssociation and the Electronic Industries Association ofJapan have been negotiating for two years to boost foreignchip participation in HDTV.   Besides trying to increase foreign share of their market,Japanese makers are turning to companies such as TexasInstruments because they are considered stronger than theJapanese in the advanced digital processing technologies usedin HDTV sets. The U.S. companies are working with theJapanese to develop chips for &quot;decoders,&quot; boxes thatunscramble transmission signals into TV pictures.   The negotiations also highlight Texas Instruments' renewedpush to break into the Japanese consumer-electronics market.While U.S. chip makers supply a relatively large amount ofthe chips placed in Japanese computers, they have done verypoorly in TVs and other home goods, largely because the U.S.industry has virtually disappeared. Texas Instruments has setup a special office in Japan just to design chips for suchproducts.   Under the new trade agreement, Japan agreed to try toboost foreign chip share to 20% of the market by the end of1992. In May, U.S. share market was 12.7%.</TEXT></DOC>
