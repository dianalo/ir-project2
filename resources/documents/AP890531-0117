The Swiss Federal Police Office received the 243-pageextradition request today and was studying it, a Justice Ministrystatement said.   Khashoggi, 54, a Saudi financier and arms dealer, has beenimprisoned in Bern since he was arrested April 18 at the request ofthe U.S. Embassy.   U.S. indictments charge Khashoggi, a jet-setter once reputed tobe among the world's richest men, with helping former PhilippinesPresident Marcos and his wife, Imelda, hide the purchase of morethan $100 million dollars in real estate and art allegedly acquiredwith money stolen from the Philippine Treasury.   Khashoggi, a friend of Marcos, is accused of posing as owner ofthe assets.   There was no comment from Khashoggi's Swiss lawyer, RalphZloczower, on the extradition request. A woman identifying herselfas his secretary answered the phone at the lawyer's office and saidhe had no statement.   Khashoggi's attorneys said after his arrest that they wouldfight extradition.   The charges cited in the U.S. extradition request were notdetailed by the Justice Ministry. They must be criminal offensesunder Swiss law for Bern to consider extradition.   Assuming Swiss authorities do not dismiss the request, Khashoggiwill be granted a hearing, the statement said.   If Switzerland grants extradition, Khashoggi can appeal thedecision to the Swiss supreme court, the Federal Tribunal.   He could be extradited ``within five to 10 days'' if he does notappeal, the ministry said.   Khashoggi, known for big deals and an alleged central role inthe Iran-Contra affair, is charged in the United States withracketeering, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. He could faceup to 20 years in prison if convicted.   The indictments alleging cover-up of the Marcos-controlledassets name the Marcoses, Khashoggi, five other people and aCalifornia bank.   A U.S. note that touched off Khashoggi's arrest at a Bern hotelcited four buildings in Manhattan and a collection of paintingsthat disappeared from a Manila museum.   Khashoggi allegedly bought them for Marcos as part of``obfuscation maneuvers'' during the ex-president's 20-year rule inthe Philippines, Swiss officials said.   The Philippine government claims that after the Marcoses wentinto exile in Hawaii in 1986, their agents and Khashoggi cartedaway 25 paintings from New York properties owned by the Marcoses.The action allegedly came after a California federal judge frozethe Marcoses' property.   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.   He was indicted in the Marcos case in October in New York.   A U.S. district issued an arrest warrant for Khashoggi on March24, according to the Swiss.   Khashoggi became known for a flamboyant lifestyle and businesstalent before reportedly hitting financial straits in recent years.   He figured in several kickback scandals where U.S. aircraftmanufacturers paid him for arranging billion-dollar defensecontracts. He reputedly was the main financier and broker in theIran-Contra affair, where proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms toIran were funneled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's government.   Under a U.S.-Swiss treaty, U.S. authorities had 60 days afterKhashoggi's arrest to file a full extradition request to elaborateon charges cited in the embassy's initial note.</TEXT></DOC>
