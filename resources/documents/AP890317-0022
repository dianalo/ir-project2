(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush says anyrestrictions on rapid-fire assault weapons must protect ``the rightsof the legitimate sportsman'' as well as the lives of the nation'spolice officers.   ``This problem isn't a problem just for the federal government,''Bush said in a speech Thursday.   His remarks reinforced the impression Bush has left in recentweeks that he is opposed to a total ban on semiautomatic weapons andwill insist that any curbs are carefully defined.   The assault weapons have become closely identified with drugtraffickers and the rash of violence and death in some of thenation's biggest cities.   A member of the National Rifle Association, Bush was outspokenagainst tighter gun controls during last year's presidentialcampaign.   After a 28-hour trip to Texas and Colorado, Bush was returningtoday to Washington, where his wife Barbara was awaiting the birthof puppies by their springer spaniel, Millie.   Explaining the first lady's absence during a brief stop in hisadopted home state, Bush told a Houston audience, ``I think herpriorities may be slightly askew but she doesn't.''   In a shift of position, the administration announced Tuesday itwas banning, at least temporarily, imports of five models ofsemiautomatic weapons. However, the decision did not affect the saleof such weapons made in the United States.   ``I do want to find a solution to the so-called AK-47 assaultweapon problem, one that protects the rights of the legitimatesportsman, but also protects the lives of our police officers whoare laying their lives on the line for us every single day,'' Bushsaid in an address in Houston before flying here for another speech.The audience of upwards of 1,000 people applauded his remark.   The NRA says the military assault rifles affected by the federalimport ban are no different intrinsically from semiautomatic armsthat are used for self-defense or legitimate sport. The NRA opposesall gun control.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, accompanying Bushon the overnight trip, said the administration welcomed the move byColt Industries to suspend sales of its AR-15, a civilian version ofthe M-16 infantry rifle.   He said Bush ``thinks it's a reasonable move on their part.''Asked if the president wanted other gun-makers to take similarsteps, Fitzwater said, ``We'll leave it where it stands.''   After his brief remark on assault weapons, Bush quickly moved onto other subjects, prodding Congress for fast action on his proposalto rescue the savings and loan industry and saying that hisadministration is not bogged down or adrift.   ``In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye ormakes the headlines,'' Bush said. Saying he was trying to lay thegroundwork for the next century, Bush said, ``The proof will comewhen we look back from the year 2000.''   In a brief question and answer session, Bush said that ``profoundchanges'' are underway both in the Soviet Union and China.   Speaking about reforms championed by Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev, Bush said, ``We've got a challenge facing the UnitedStates. We've got to figure it out. We've got to measure Sovietintentions and then move _ then come forward with proposals thatwill enhance the peace for our kids and our grandkids.''   In remarks in Colorado Springs, Bush focused on the theme ofeducation and discussed steps he has proposed to improve thenation's school system.   ``When it comes to our nation's future,'' Bush said, ``educationis the key. It's the best investment we can make.''</TEXT></DOC>
