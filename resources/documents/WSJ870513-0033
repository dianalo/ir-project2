Stewart and Daniel HertzbergStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the first serious blow to the government since Wall Street's insider-trading scandal began a year ago, a federal judge refused to give prosecutors the additional time they said they needed to prepare a case against three prominent arbitragers charged with insider trading.    The surprise ruling by U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton forces the government to begin its trial next Wednesday despite claims by prosecutors that such a ruling gives the defendants &quot;an unwarranted tactical advantage.&quot; The government had sought to delay the start of trial until July 20.    The government is expected to seek additional time by rushing to obtain a new, expanded indictment from a grand jury before any trial of the charges contained in the existing indictment begins. Such a move doesn't automatically entitle the government to additional time. However, the government could request a delay, and defense lawyers also might do so if confronted for the first time with greatly expanded charges.    The three defendants, whose arrests last February stunned Wall Street, are Robert M. Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs and Co.; Richard B. Wigton, former head of arbitrage at Kidder, Peabody and Co.; and Timothy L. Tabor, a former arbitrager at Kidder, which is a unit of General Electric Co.    The government's tactic in arresting the defendants was harshly criticized yesterday by defense lawyers, who argued that their clients had been &quot;publicly humiliated.&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney John M. McEnany, arguing for the delay on behalf of the government, conceded that &quot;with the benefit of hindsight&quot; the government might have waited, and said that &quot;we can be faulted for trying to proceed too fast.&quot;    Lawyers for the defendants could barely contain their glee at the judge's unexpected ruling. &quot;We're going to trial next week, which is what we want to do,&quot; said Paul M. Curran, Mr. Freeman's lawyer. Stanley S. Arkin, the lawyer for Mr. Wigton, said he is &quot;delighted&quot; by the decision. The government &quot;made a mistake when they arrested the defendants before they had conducted an investigation,&quot; said Andrew M. Lawler, Mr. Tabor's lawyer. He characterized the arrests as an &quot;abuse of the legal process.&quot;    Judge Stanton, in making his ruling, cited the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees defendants a speedy and public trial. The judge also granted several discovery requests by the defendants, ordering the government to give them copies of agreements between Martin A. Siegel, the former Kidder investment banker who is likely to be the government's star witness, and the U.S. attorney, and between Mr. Siegel and the Securities and Exchange Commission.    A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said, &quot;I wouldn't characterize it as a defeat,&quot; and said the government is &quot;examining its options&quot; following the judge's ruling. He added, &quot;at some point we anticipate bringing an indictment which includes all the relevant charges arising out of the case.&quot;    The government has said that it plans to seek an expanded indictment that would include details of alleged insider trading involving the stocks of nine companies and 12 transactions. The current indictment, issued by the government last month, mentions the stocks of only two companies, Unocal Corp. and Storer Communications Inc., leading Mr. Arkin to question why the government obtained an indictment it never intended to take to trial. &quot;Everything was out front months and months ago,&quot; he said.    At yesterday's hearing, the judge's rulings and prosecutors' comments reinforced impressions that the government's high-stakes case may be in disarray. Mr. McEnany said the government needed a &quot;minimum&quot; of an additional two months of preparation, given the complexity of the case.    At the time of the defendants' arrests, Mr. Giuliani indicated that the government had been forced to act sooner than it had planned, but didn't elaborate. Since then, Neil S. Cartusciello, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the case, has complained of overwork. Although he appeared rested yesterday, Mr. Cartusciello seemed visibly fatigued at a hearing on Monday.    Even if a new indictment is forthcoming, defense lawyers are likely to seize on such signs of weakness by the prosecution and press for a speedy trial. In the wake of yesterday's rulings in their favor, defense lawyers may also seek a nonjury trial before Judge Stanton.    The case is being closely watched, especially in the financial and legal communities. It appears likely to be the first trial of insider-trading charges since the scandal began a year ago with the arrest of former investment banker Dennis B. Levine. The case also pits the resources of the government against individuals associated with two of Wall Street's most powerful institutions, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody. </TEXT></DOC>
