Following the 90-minute session at the Algerian Embassy of theprice and long-term strategy committees of the Organization ofPetroleum-Exporting Countries, spokesman James Audu said theorganization's secretary general Subroto would hold a newsconference Friday morning prior to beginning a second meeting.   After the meeting broke up, Iraq's Oil Minister IssamAbdul-Raheem Al-Chalabi said it was too early for him to comment onhis country's position on a production sharing agreement.   Indonesia's Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reportersthere were ``some miles to go'' before a production agreement couldbe reached but added that all 13 OPEC members were committeed tofinding a solution to ``current discord.''   Current OPEC production is estimated at around 20 million to 21million barrels a day, far above the cartel's official ceiling of15.06 million barrels a day.   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have proposed17.4 million barrels a day, including Iraq's share, as a morerealistic ceiling.   Iraq, now outside the quota system, has demanded a quota equalto that of Iran, at 2.369 million barrels a day.   Analysts report that Iraq has been pumping at least 2.6 millionbarrels of crude a day, an amount that could rise to 3.7 millionbarrels in mid-1989 with the completion of a a new pipeline throughSaudi Arabia to the Red Sea.   Iran has been pumping 2.5 million barrels a day, the analystssay.   Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria all saidThursday they would only accept a new production pact if itincluded Iraq.   But Aqazadeh, who is meeting with his Iraqi counterpartAl-Chalabi for the first time in an OPEC setting since an Augustcease-fire ended the eight-year Gulf War, said Iran would notaccept an agreement that gave Iraq production parity. He added hehad no alternative proposals to solve the long-standing problem.   Both Iran and Iraq want to pump and sell as much oil as possibleto increase revenue to rebuild their war-battered nations.   Venezuelan Oil Minister Julio Cesar Gil said Thursday if OPECnations don't comply with their production quotas under any newagreement, the cartel would simply find itself facing the same oilglut that has been forcing prices down in the past months.   An excess of oil on international markets has sent pricestumbling to below $12 a barrel in recent weeks, far below the OPECtarget of $18 a barrel.   The OPEC price committee includes oil ministers from Algeria,Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.   Ministers from Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuelasit on the long-term strategy committee.   The remaining OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar andthe United Arab Emirates.   The price committee met Sept. 25-26 in Madrid without resolvingthe production problem. All 13 OPEC members are to meet in Viennain November.</TEXT></DOC>
