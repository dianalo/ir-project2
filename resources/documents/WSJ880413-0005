Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F </CO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   Last year while Ford Motor Co. achieved the highest earnings in automotive history, its top executives pulled down record earnings of their own.    Documents sent to shareholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Ford's 44 highest-ranking executives earned $12.9 million in salaries and $29.9 million in bonuses during 1987, a 39.2% increase from 1986 and easily the largest sum paid by any American auto maker to its top executives, officials at the Big Three auto makers said.    Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen received $3,730,000 from salary and bonuses, a 90% increase from 1986, while Ford Vice Chairman Harold A. Poling earned $2.8 million, 72% more in cash compensation. A Ford spokesman said Mr. Petersen didn't exercise any stock options last year, but Mr. Poling received nearly $8.1 million in 1987 from his options.    In 1986, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca alone earned $20.6 million, but only $1.7 million of that came from salary and cash bonuses. The rest came from stock options Mr. Iacocca exercised that year.    The highest amount ever paid to any General Motors Corp. executive was the $1.7 million in salary and bonus Chairman Roger B. Smith received in 1985, a GM spokeswoman said.    Chrysler and GM haven't reported their top executives' pay for 1987 yet.    The Ford executives' sizable 1987 pay boost was largely caused by the No. 2 auto maker's record net income of $4.6 billion last year. A company formula bases a major portion of executive pay on performance. Including the bonuses for Mr. Petersen and Mr. Poling, Ford paid a total of $247.9 million in bonuses to 5,166 executives throughout the company, or an average of nearly $48,000.    To be sure, the company's 39% earnings increase also boosted overall income for hourly and nonexecutive Ford employees, who each received an average of $3,700 in profit sharing.    But United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President Stephen P. Yokich issued a joint statement yesterday saying Ford's huge executive pay &quot;shows the same greedy, shortsighted instincts that almost all American corporations exhibit.    &quot;We just don't believe that Mr. Petersen or anyone else is worth over 100 times as much as a UAW production worker is worth to Ford,&quot; the UAW officials said. &quot;We don't think Ford will truly be the kind of U.S. corporate leader it aspires to be until their top people outgrow the gravy-train mentality.&quot;    A UAW spokesman said the average Ford auto plant worker gets $35,000 in wages and overtime. The labor contract signed by Ford and the UAW last fall gives Ford's UAW workers a 3% raise in 1988, as well as cost-of-living pay adjustments.    In a separate matter, Ford proposed an amendment to its bonus plan that would allow all employees to get immediate bonuses for good work. The Ford spokesman said the plan is similar to an employee incentive plan used by GM. The company's proxy statement estimates that such a plan could cost $4 million a year if the bonuses ranged from $50 to $250 each. </TEXT></DOC>
