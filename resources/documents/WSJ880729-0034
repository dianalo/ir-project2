The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to 9.26% from 9.25% late Wednesday. Prices of most long-term Treasury, corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed issues fell less than a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    Bond prices slumped early in the day after the government reported unexpectedly strong gains in personal income and consumer spending last month. Analysts said the 0.7% gain in personal income and 1% surge in personal consumption expenditures could portend higher inflation later this year and increased interest rates.    But bonds later rebounded somewhat as traders were encouraged by sharp declines in commodity prices. &quot;I look at lower oil prices and I look at metal prices, and I say where's the big pickup in inflation?&quot; said Alan Bozian, first vice president at the Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.    Nevertheless, Mr. Bozian and many other traders contend that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further in coming months to make sure that inflation remains under control. &quot;I think the next move in rates will be up,&quot; Mr. Bozian said. &quot;The standard prediction now is the fed funds rate will be 8% by Labor Day.&quot; The federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, has averaged about 7 7/8% recently.    Earlier this week, interest rates rose amid speculation that the Fed already might be tightening credit another notch. But officials familiar with the Fed's actions quickly denied any change in policy, and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated yesterday that the Fed hasn't changed monetary policy in recent weeks.    Mr. Greenspan, at a hearing of a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, said that while some recent figures have been stronger than he expected and others weaker, none &quot;has altered either my, or as far as I can judge the board's, general view as to where we are going and where we have been.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Greenspan also repeated a warning that the Fed &quot;at this juncture might be well-advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.&quot; Moreover, he said he found &quot;a bit surprising&quot; the extent of inflation in the second quarter, saying it was &quot;somewhat larger than I would have expected&quot; from previously published data.    The Fed's next move could come as early as a week from today. Several analysts expect employment statistics to be released by the Labor Department Aug. 5 to provide additional confirmation of the economy's strength. Fed officials monitor the employment figures especially closely.    Yesterday's economic reports &quot;showed strength&quot; and contributed to the bond market's small decline, said Robert Sbarra, vice president and deputy head of the U.S. government bond department at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. &quot;As long as we continue to get strong economic numbers, the (bond) market's going to continue to erode.&quot;    Traders also are focusing intently on the dollar's value in the foreign-exchange markets. A lower dollar would raise inflation fears and possibly discourage foreigners from adding to their dollar holdings, leading to higher U.S. interest rates, bond traders fear.    Foreign central banks probably will intervene in the currency markets to keep the dollar close to current levels at least until after the U.S. election in November, some analysts contend.    &quot;My guess is the dollar will hold steady until the election,&quot; said Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Blackstone Group and a former U.S. secretary of commerce. But he remains deeply worried about the longer-term outlook for both the dollar and the U.S. economy, &quot;given that our fiscal affairs still are seriously out of balance and given our enormous need for foreign capital.&quot;    Treasury Securities   The Treasury's latest 30-year bonds fell to 98 21/32 from 98 3/4 Wednesday. The government's 10-year notes declined to 99 2/32 from 99 1/8, while the yield rose to 9.14% from 9.13%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 2.94 points to 1213.28. The low was 1210.56 and the high was 1216.92.    Despite increases in most rates, shortterm Treasury bill rates fell slightly. The latest three-month bills were quoted late yesterday at 6.97%, down from 6.99% Wednesday. The rate on 26-week bills slipped to 7.13% from 7.16%.    The federal funds rate yesterday averaged about 7.89%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That compared with 7.42% Wednesday and an average of 7.80% in the week ended Wednesday, 7.83% the previous week and 7.59% the week before that.    Traders expect the government's quarterly financing operation, to be announced next Wednesday, to total between about $19 billion and $20.5 billion of notes. The financing is expected to include $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion of three-year notes for sale Aug. 9, and $9.75 billion to $10.5 billion of 10-year notes for auction Aug. 10.    No new 30-year bonds are expected. Although both the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee have approved measures clearing the way for unlimited long bond issuance, full congressional action isn't seen in time to offer a new bond at this refunding.    Yesterday, the Treasury sold $9.02 billion of 52-week bills at an average rate of 7.40%. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                               52-Week Applications ......................... $31,516,490,000 Accepted bids ......................... $9,020,550,000 Accepted at low price ............................ 76% Accepted noncompetitively ............... $465,410,000 Average price (Rate) ................... 92.518(7.40%) High price (Rate) ...................... 92.528(7.39%) Low price (Rate) ....................... 92.508(7.41%) Coupon equivalent .............................. 7.95%   The bills are dated Aug. 4 and mature Aug. 3, 1989.   Foreign Bonds   West German government bond prices were flat to down slightly following the Bundesbank's latest increase in the Lombard rate.   The Bundesbank earlier in the day increased the Lombard, the rate that is applied to very short-term borrowing using securities as collateral, half a percentage point to 5%. Traders said the increase had been expected and thus already was largely reflected in bond prices.   Raising the Lombard rate represented the latest twist in a series of tightening moves to stem capital outflows, fight inflation and rebalance West Germany's rate structure. The increase by West Germany's central bank triggered similar steps in the Netherlands and Austria, which closely track Bundesbank interest rate trends.   The central bank of the Netherlands announced an increase in its discount rate to 3.75% from 3.5% as well as increases in a number of other official Dutch rates. Austria's central bank lifted its Lombard rate half a point to 5%.   West German analysts had expected the Bundesbank move in view of the central bank's continued concern that a rising dollar could mar efforts to reduce the nation's trade surplus and fuel inflationary potential at home. In addition, the rate increases are aimed at reining in money supply growth.   The Bundesbank said in a statement that the Lombard boost &quot;is in response to developments in market interest rates and tensions in the currency market.&quot;   Monetary analysts don't expect any further increases in West Germany's fixed interest rates, the Lombard and the discount rates, until September or later.   &quot;There has a been a significant round of tightening in the past six weeks, but it hasn't had a lot of effect,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London. &quot;There is a sense in the market that this (rise) may be the end of an episode,&quot; the economist said, &quot;but in September rates could begin going up again unless the D-mark can motor itself up on its own.&quot;   The government's 6 1/2% issue due 1998 was quoted late yesterday at a price of 97.65 bid, off 0.10 point from 97.75 late Wednesday. The issue yielded 6.83% late yesterday. The European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 was flat at 96.35 bid.   In London, prices of British government issues rose, buoyed by a strong rally in sterling and the view that this will prevent any further rise in U.K. base rates in the near-term.   The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 rose 3/8 point to 116 3/32 to yield 9.66%. Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was up 9/32 to 103 25/32 to yield 9.95%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 was up 10/32 at 109 13/32 to yield 9.99%.   In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices rose in heavy volume.   Bonds rallied even though the Bank of Japan allowed a 1/16 percentage point increase in the two-month bill-discount rate to 4.0625%. Bonds initially fell on the news, but quickly recovered.   Traders attributed the rebound largely to declines in rates on the closely watched three-month certificates of deposit. The rate on three-month CDs, a key bond market indicator, fell to 4.79% from 4.86% earlier in the week.   The government's 5%, No. 105 issue due closed at a yield of 4.92%, down 6.5 basis points. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. The closing price was 100.51, up 0.42 from Wednesday.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to slightly lower, after trading in a narrow range all day.   The dearth of municipal supply, a lack of institutional selling pressure and recent strong investor demand for new paper remain the biggest factors providing support for tax-exempt bonds. As has been the case in recent weeks, these factors continued to help the market yesterday post a good performance compared with Treasurys.   Among seasoned dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted late yesterday at 90 5/8-90 7/8, yielding 8.01%. The bond late Wednesday stood at 90 7/8.   In Chicago, September municipal futures settled down 2/32 at 87-09, while the front month T-bond contract ended down 2/32 at 85-24. The respective settlements left the MOB spread, or difference between the contracts, at its widest positive close of 1988, 49/32.   Since municipal futures began trading in 1985, the MOB-municipal over T-bonds-spread has often been a misnomer, with muni futures frequently trading below their Treasury counterparts. The negative spread has largely been the result of market dislocations created by congressional wrangling over the tax-exempt status of state and local bonds.   But with new-issue supply scant, little selling pressure from institutions and investors snapping up what deals are unveiled, the MOB spread has been growing increasingly positive since July 13. On that day, the MOB closed in positive territory for the first time since turning negative in June, ending the session at plus 12/32, according to Boston-based Municipal Market Data Inc.   Corporate Issues   Bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point lower after a session of thin, spotty trading.   Weakness in Treasurys and the morning report of the unexpected growth in personal income and personal consumption expenditures in June set the stage for the lackluster corporate market performance.   There was little in the way of new corporate debt issuance in the session.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities were slightly lower in light trading.   In the asset-backed market, Signet Bank offered $180 million of pass-through certificates backed by auto loans through a group led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   Among mortgage issues, August 9% Ginnie Mae securities were quoted at 93 18/32, down 1/32, and 10% securities at 99 11/32, down 2/32.   The 10% issue was yielding 10.23% to a 12-year average life, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note held at 109 basis points. The 10-year note was off 3/32 at 98 31/32.   No Remic offerings were priced, but some new issues are anticipated soon.   It's expected that underwriters will structure deals using floating-rate classes tied to the 11th district cost-of-funds index, given the success of two offerings from Santa Barbara Savings andamp; Loan Association and Fannie Mae earlier this week.</TEXT></DOC>
