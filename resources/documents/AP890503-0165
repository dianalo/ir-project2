Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee told DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney they had serious concerns about West Germanpositions favoring a delay in modernization of the weapons andurging U.S.-Soviet negotiations to scale back the short-rangerockets.   The West German stand and the Bush administration's support fortripling the range of the U.S.-built Lance missiles has created amajor dispute within the 16-member NATO alliance.   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusionthey can place more faith and reliance on (Soviet President MikhailS.) Gorbachev's words and assurances than they can upon sound NATOstrategy, then it would be very difficult for me to continue tocommit the size of the forces we have in Europe under thosecircumstances,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said that if the missiles areeliminated and the 324,000 U.S. forces are put at risk, theadministration's policy should be ``that a substantial percentageof troops be brought home and we allow West Germany greaterresponsibility of their defense.''   Cheney, on Capitol Hill to discuss the fiscal 1990 defensebudget, cautioned against ``overdramatizing the nature of thecurrent differences'' within NATO.   But Cheney speculated that if a consensus called for a zerolevel for the short-range missiles, ``I as secretary of defensewould have something of a stomach ache if we found ourself in theposition where in fact large numbers of our NATO allies encouragedus to maintain our conventional forces in Europe but take out allour nuclear weapons in Europe.''   The defense secretary said President Bush has not consideredthat possibility but if it did occur, there would be a ``majordust-up in the alliance.''   West Germany wants the United States to negotiate with theSoviet Union on reductions in the short-range missiles. The UnitedStates and Britain have rejected such negotiations.   Alliance members are hoping to reach some internal consensusprior to the NATO summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, expressed concernsthat ``NATO appears to be shooting itself in the foot ...everyday'' by focusing on such a narrow issue, and faulted bothsides in the dispute for failing to show any vision.   ``I don't see any strategy on the part of the German governmentwhere they're basically saying they won't modernize but they wantto negotiate,'' Nunn told Cheney. ``I don't see much strategycoming out of the other side's position which says we insist onmodernizing and building a weapon that you will not accept but wewon't negotiate even if the Soviets make tremendous unequalpositions.''   Nunn said the NATO alliance is letting slip an opportunity tonegotiate reductions in conventional forces. The chairman suggesteda three-track approach linking modernization of the short-rangemissile, reductions of the weapons and cuts in conventionalstrength.   Cheney said the debate within the NATO alliance is ``a verydifficult and delicate area,'' although he termed the West Germanposition ``a weak one because it focuses solely on negotiation.''   During his appearance before the panel, Cheney also played downthe apparent disparity between his pessimistic assessment ofGorbachev's chances of implementing reforms and the view held byBush.   ``The president and I were in a meeting yesterday and franklychuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on viewsthat we have expressed. We do not perceive a significant differencein terms of our views of the situation with respect to the SovietUnion,'' Cheney said.   The defense secretary created a stir last week by speculatingGorbachev may fail to institute reforms and could be replaced by ahardliner.   Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White Housechief of staff John Sununu offered more hopeful assessments ofGorbachev's liberalization efforts, although they did not publiclyrebuke Cheney.   Cheney said Wednesday that he ``responded previously the otherday perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view ...somewhat pessimistic concerning Mr. Gorbachev's prospect forachieving his reforms.''   ``The president has expressed the hope those reforms will besuccessful. We don't see those ... as contradictory statements,''Cheney said.   On other matters, Cheney:   _Said a Pentagon review panel would determine if testing of``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced Star Wars system consistingof thousands of orbiting satellites, would violate the broadinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. ``I'mcertainly not about to embark on an activity breaching thattreaty,'' Cheney said.   _Defended his decision to eliminate the V-22 Osprey despitecomplaints from Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, that $2 billion and nineyears of work have been invested in the ship-to-shore aircraft.Cheney said if Congress found some way to put money back in thebudget, he would not object to bringing the program back.</TEXT></DOC>
