Most of the commonly occurring failures can be easilydiagnosed and corrected with the help of a robot fault diagnosis expertsystem. Usually, a human expert in machine fault diagnosis uses boththe design descriptions of the various components of the machine andsimple decision rules based on his experience to diagnose machine failures.Developing a cognitive model of this combination of deeper reasoningbased on design descriptions of robot components, and shallow reasoningbased on simple decision rules for diagnosing robot failures will trulyemulate the reasoning process of a human robot diagnosis expert. Thispaper discusses the design, development and implementation of a robotfault diagnosis expert system using a combination of both deep and shallowmodeling approaches. This discussion includes the capabilities of theimplemented expert system to diagnose new symptoms and to provide explanationssimilar to a human expert.</TEXT></DOC>
