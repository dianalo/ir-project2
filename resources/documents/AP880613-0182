Following a round of opening statements on the Family SecurityAct, key senators retired to the office of Sen. Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan., to try to work out differences with theadministration, which was threatening to veto the measure.   The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,said the first session was ``very promising'' and that the meetingswould continue through the evening and on Tuesday.   ``We have been attempting to find some solutions and we clearlyare making progress, at least in some very specific regards,''Moynihan said.   Dole said past congressional moves have only made the welfaresystem worse. ``What we do here in the next few days in the Senatewill be a step in the right direction, for once,'' he said.   The five-year, $2.6 billion bill is consensus measure that took18 months to develop. It is a compromise version of a $7 billionwelfare plan passed by the House last Dec. 17.   Besides putting more welfare recipients to work, the bill wouldforce more absentee parents to pay child support and require statesto provide at least six months of welfare benefits to poorhouseholds with two parents.   Government checks are the main feature of the current Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children program, serving 3.7 millionfamilies, including 7 million children, though there is asmall-scale work program.   The Moynihan bill and the more expensive House bill attempt toturn welfare into a jobs system, with goverment checks a lastresort if wages and child support payments are inadequate.   ``Never has the Senate considered so fundamental a redirectionof the (welfare) system,'' Moynihan said.   ``It's tempting to say this is an historical moment ... and yetevents will decide whether that was the case,'' he said, referringto uncertainty over whether President Reagan would veto the bill.   The administration was seeking, among other things, broaderauthority for states to use federal money for experimental welfareschemes; a mandatory percentage of people participating in work,training or education programs; and a brand-new mandatory workfareor public works program that one senator said would cost $900million.   The Office of Management and Budget said in a statement Mondaythat Reagan would veto the bill in its present form.   Many senators said the Moynihan measure is sorely needed toupdate and improve a 53-year-old program conceived as a temporarybenefit for widows in an age when divorced, working and unmarriedmothers were a rarity.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, called welfare reform ``an urgent national priority.''He said the nation is making do with ``a Rube Goldberg welfaresystem developed during the Depression to meet the needs of asociety that no longer exists.''   Bentsen and others hammered at Moynihan's themes that childrenare the poorest population group in America today and that theirtraining for the job market is important given projections of animpending labor shortage.   ``Millions of children who are living in poverty and receivingwelfare today must become the trained, motivated workers oftomorrow,'' Bentsen said.   States would have to require parents to furnish Social Securitynumbers at the birth of their children; meet minimum standards forestablishing paternity; set guidelines for child support awards;and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks.   All states would be required to have a jobs, education andtraining program for welfare recipients with children age 3 orover, or age 1 at state option. States would have to guaranteechild care for participants, and spend half their money on peoplewho are or are likely to be long-term welfare recipients.   Nine months of transitional child care assistance and a year ofMedicaid coverage would be required for people moving off welfareinto the workforce.   Another provision would require states to give welfare benefitsto families with two parents in the home. Twenty-six states alreadyprovide such benefits; Moynihan's compromise would make six monthsa year mandatory in the other 24 states.   The Moynihan bill would be financed primarily by makingpermanent the Internal Revenue Service's refund withholding programfor delinquent federal debtors and phasing out the dependent caretax credit for higher-income taxpayers.   The House bill offers states financial incentives to raise theirbenefit levels, many of which are far below the federal povertyline. Liberal lawmakers and interest groups have criticized theSenate bill for leaving out the provision.</TEXT></DOC>
