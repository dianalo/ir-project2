To provide conventionalsystems for preparing natural gas and recovering natural gas liquids,all the separate major pressure components must be built, installed andinterconnected with piping and control instruments. This is all costly.In contrast, this invention is comprised of a single vessel shell containingthe low temperature separator, the gas-to-gas exchanger, the fractionationcolumn, condensed water inhibitor removal points, and the inhibitor point.Only an inlet raw gas liquids removal system, an inhibitor removal andinjection system, a chiller and regeneration system are extra to providea complete and operating raw gas processing system. In addition, thisinvention eliminates much of the waste presently flared into the atmospherewhile at the same time providing additional income from that waste product.4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
