Department of DefenseNetwork Management.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>An Orange Book With the expansion in demand for Open Systems in general,there is a proliferation of networked systems.andP;  Such systems are often easilyaccessible to the public; perhaps even being connected to phone lines.andP;  This,in turn, increases the need for high standards of system security.andP;  Variouscompanies are now looking to produce tested, secure systems which provideuniversally accepted standards of security for Open Systems.andP;  It is in thisclimate that reference to the 'Orange Book' is becoming more and morefrequent.andM;The Orange Book, properly called the Trusted Computer Systems EvaluationCriteria, derives its name from a bright orange cover.andP;  It is published bythe US Department of Defense and provides guidelines for developers andbuyers of trusted systems.andP;  It was originally intended for those operating inthe realm of US Government and military contracts.andP;  Commercial implicationshave arisen because the Orange Book standards have become more widelyaccepted and acknowledged, and companies have started to brand their productsas compliant with one or another level.andP;  This has considerable market impact,since gaining compliance above the C level - discussed below - is a difficultand lengthy process.andM;Seven levelsandM;The Orange Book sets out seven, well defined levels of security.andP;  Theselevels are grouped into four bands, namely A (Verified Protection), which isthe highest level; B (Mandatory Access Control); C (Discretionary AccessControl) and D (Minimal Security), with subdivisions within B and C.andM;To satisfy class D requirements all you have to do is fail to meet thecriteria demanded by the higher grades - so no problem there!andM;The next level in the hierarchy is C1, (Discretionary Security) the level atwhich most commercial multi-user systems are categorised.andP;  A named user ofsuch a system must be able to prevent his files being read or destroyed byanother user.andP;  In effect, a user would have to prove his identity, in alllikelihood with a password.andP;  The security system itself must be secureagainst tampering, and the system in its entirety formally tested anddocumented.andP;  UNIX System V, for example, provides most of this as standard,so extra kits are almost certainly not needed at this level.andM;C2 relates to Controlled Access.andP;  Access to a file here can be permitted orrefused down to the level of any one particular user.andP;  No-one can ever beallowed to see another user's discarded memory or disk space even if the datain it was already encoded.andP;  A record must be kept of all login, opening,creating or deleting events and the system administrator's actions mustlikewise be audited.andM;When you move up to the MAC tier, the lowest level is B1 (Labelled Security),moving up through B2 (Modular Structure) to B3 (Isolated domains).andP;  MandatoryAccess Control is not standard in UNIX systems, so a kit will probably berequired to achieve this level.andP;  MAC can be rather restrictive.andP;  Every objectin the system is given a sensitivity label, not unlike the notions of 'TopSecret', 'Secret' and so on down to 'Unclassified'.andP;  Each object or file hasonly one sensitivity level and is accessible only to those users who arecleared up to that particular level.andM;Files are also categorised according to their contents (for example:'salaries', or 'sales' or 'accounts').andP;  A user is restricted to entering onlythose files which relate to his specific area of concern and only then, ofcourse, at the level to which he has been cleared.andP;  All hard copy printed outfrom the system would automatically be labelled with its sensitivity leveland category information, and dealt with accordingly.andP;  Changes to anindividual's clearance level and category membership would be strictlycontrolled since, obviously, opportunities for self-promotion would defeatthe system.andM;At the very top of the scale, Verified Protection, there is only one category- A1 (Formal proof of correctness).andP;  You cannot 'bolt on' security featuresinto a product to achieve A1 classification.andP;  It has to be designed fromscratch to comply.andP;  You must provide 'a formal model of security policy ...andO;including a mathematical proof that the model is consistent with its axioms'.andO;Heavy stuff.andP;  I cannot conceive of a situation where a commercialorganisation would request a supplier to develop a system to the A1 securestandard - this is the point at which military and commercial applicationspart company.andM;While the Orange Book defines very precise levels of security, it should beappreciated that no computer system is really secure unless sensiblestandards of administration and application are set up and followed.andP;  It isalso important to evaluate very carefully which level of security will bestsuit your requirements.andP;  It is a waste of both time and money to provide toohigh a level of security.andP;  That subtle combination of acceptable levels ofcost, restricted use and suitable security is one you must work out foryourself - the Orange Book will not do it for you!andM;Bob Mitze is the Managing Director of UNIX System Laboratories, Europe (USLE)- formerly ATandamp;T UNIX Software Operation Europe, Ltd.andP;
