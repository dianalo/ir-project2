The 18-1 vote drew praise from the seven Baby Bells, butit was sharply criticized by consumer groups and AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Opponents have long contended thatthe phone companies, if allowed to make their own equipment,would compete unfairly, leading ultimately to higher localtelephone rates.</LP><TEXT>   Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), whointroduced the bill, has argued that global competitionthreatens the U.S. telecommunications equipment industry andthat lifting the restriction would encourage the seven giantBell companies to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Sen. Hollingswants a full Senate vote on the measure soon, but a specificschedule hasn't been established. Similar legislation isexpected to be introduced in the House, but it isn't likelyto move quickly in that chamber.   At least three lawmakers are planning legislation that isnearly identical to the Hollings bill. However, Rep. EdwardMarkey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunicationsand Finance subcommittee, is preparing a broader proposal. Inaddition to many manufacturing provisions already in theHollings bill, the Markey measure includes so-calledsafeguards that would be imposed on the Baby Bells if theywere to win greater freedom from Congress or the courts toenter other restricted businesses. The safeguards aredesigned to prevent anti-competitive behavior.   Although several Bells sell telephones and other equipmentunder their brand names, they do so under marketingagreements and aren't allowed to manufacture the equipmentthemselves.   Ronald Stowe, who heads Pacific Telesis Group's Washingtonoffice, said the bill &quot;will benefit consumers by encouraginginnovation and creativity in the public network, not just inniche markets.&quot; Mr. Stowe also heads a coalition of Bellcompanies pushing to lift all the restrictions on the BabyBells contained in the 1982 consent decree that broke upATandamp;T.   Meanwhile, opponents are working to change or halt thebill. Michael Baudhuin, ATandamp;T's corporate vice president,public affairs, said several aspects of the bill haven't beencarefully examined, including its antitrust underpinnings,the impact on research and development, and how many U.S.jobs it could create.   &quot;This will take the equipment market back to the past,&quot; hesaid, noting that the ATandamp;T breakup stemmed from a caseinvolving Western Electric, ATandamp;T's manufacturing arm.   Except for a provision requiring Bell companies tomanufacture in the U.S. and to use some U.S.-made parts, thebill is essentially the same as one that cleared thecommittee in the last Congress. The domestic-contentprovision was negotiated by the Bells and the CommunicationsWorkers of America.   The bill contains several safeguards aimed at discouraginganti-competitive behavior by the Bells, including usingrevenue from telephone customers to subsidize manufacturingventures. But consumer groups contend the checks aren'tenough.   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the ConsumerFederation of America, said the Hollings bill is certain topush up local phone rates because it would give the Bells astrong incentive to buy from their own affiliates. Suchfavoritism would be inevitable, he argued, adding that theBells have a track record of rate-payer abuses and a historyof inadequate regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
