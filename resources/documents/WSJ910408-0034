The rate of deaths among babies less than a year old fellto 9.1 for every 1,000 live births, a 6% decline from 1989,according to a report by the National Center for HealthStatistics.</LP><TEXT>   While the infant death rate has declined from 20 deathsfor every 1,000 live births in 1970, it is still higher thanthat of many other industrialized countries. In addition,1988 figures showed the rate is much higher in some innercities, and is nearly twice as high for blacks as for whites.   The Bush administration has said reducing infant mortalityis a priority and it has proposed spending more than $180million on infant mortality programs next fiscal year. Butthe proposals have been controversial because some of themoney would be taken from existing public health programs.   It was unclear why the rate of infant deaths fell sosharply last year. Some people believe an expansion ofMedicaid, the government's health-insurance program for thepoor, has helped fight infant mortality in recent years.Others cite a new drug for premature babies.</TEXT></DOC>
