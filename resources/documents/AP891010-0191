House and Senate leaders of both parties met for nearly twohours but reached no agreement in their dispute, which has delayedSenate work on a deficit-reduction bill.   Unless the budget-cutting measure is passed by Monday, spendingcuts in many defense and domestic programs will be automaticallytriggered by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.   The bargaining, which began last week, resumed as congressionalexperts estimated the size of the spending cuts that would occurMonday. Their non-binding estimate: $41.3 billion, out of a $1.2trillion budget.   The sticking point in the deficit-reduction talks has been GOPefforts to have the Senate vote on a plan to reduce the capitalgains tax rate, which President Bush promised to fight for duringhis election campaign.   Leaders of both parties have been maneuvering for parliamentaryadvantages in how that vote will occur. They have been exploringways to keep the capital gains cut _ along with other controversialprovisions _ from being attached to the Senate's $14 billiondeficit-reduction bill, which is considered must-pass legislation.   Asked Tuesday if the administration would accept a stripped-downdeficit-cutting measure in exchange for a separate Senate vote oncapital gains later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,``We believe the capital gains provision should be a part'' of thebill.   After Tuesday's meeting of congressional leaders, SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Fitzwater's commentshad ``complicated'' the talks.   ``It appears that the White House is intent on torpedoing thisdiscussion,'' he said.   He added, ``The administration doesn't really care about thedeficit.''   The House last week approved its own $11 billiondeficit-reduction bill that contained a two-year capital gains taxcut, an extension of child-care programs, a rollback of Medicarebenefits for elderly people with serious, long-term diseases, andother controversial provisions.   The House provision would make the maximum capital gains taxrate 19.6 percent for two years, instead of the current maximum of28 percent (33 percent for some taxpayers).   Democrats and Republicans agree that slimming down that bill _and figuring out a way to deal with the numerous initiatives incontains _ is such a difficult task that avoiding the Gramm-Rudmancuts is all but impossible.   ``You're not going to avoid'' the automatic cuts, said SenateRepublican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``I think we're all prettymuch in agreement on that.''   The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projecteddeficit for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 is not below $110billion.   The Congressional Budget Office projected Tuesday that theshortfall will be $141.3 billion, necessitating cuts of $41.3billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs. Theoffice said many domestic programs would take a 10.7 percent cutand many defense programs would take a 15.6 percent cut. Someprograms in both areas are exempt from spending reductions underGramm-Rudman.   The CBO projections are merely advisory. The White House'sOffice of Management and Budget issues its binding projectionsMonday. They are expected to require about $16 billion in cuts,divided equally between defense and domestic programs.</TEXT></DOC>
