Low prices account for the change, along with the fact theUnited States uses much more energy in comparison with othercountries, analysts say.   The Energy Information Administration has revised 1987 figuresto show efficiency unchanged from 1986, Jerry Lagace, an EIAeconomist, said in an interview Friday.   It's the first time since 1976 that efficiency failed to improve.   Lagace noted that energy efficiency in the economy may haveincreased for the first quarter of the year over the 1987 quarter,but the 3.5 percent increase ``is so large that I don't believe it.This will probably be revised downward.''   Gains have been running at about 2.5 percent per year since themid-1970s; EIA had expected future gains of about 1 percent peryear. Preliminary 1987 statistics had indicated a 0.5 percent gainover 1986.   Lagace said further study is needed to pin down reasons. Growingexports of goods that take a lot of energy to produce, such as farmmachinery, could be one reason. More driving is another possibility.   Efficiency has been improving throughout the industrial marketeconomies since the 1960s, though the 1973 oil embargo greatlyaccelerated it. U.S. performance has been strong; some major U.S.competitors have done better.   ``Energy is very cheap here,'' said Art Rosenfeld, director ofthe Center for Building Science at the Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory at Berkeley, Calif.   ``When you and I were growing up, they flared natural gas, andwe built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burnmore gas than to add insulation,'' Rosenfeld said in an interview.   Attitudes change slowly, so ``we haven't paid attention toinvestments that take five, six or seven years to pay back, likethe Germans and the Japanese do,'' Rosenfeld said.   Europe and Japan use high gasoline taxes to raise revenue andhold down consumption, while the United States throughout the 1970skept gasoline under price controls and required minimum mileagestandards for automobiles. Gasoline in Italy last year wasquadruple the U.S. price; in Japan triple and in Germany more thandouble.   Today, the average new U.S. car must get 26 miles per gallon andall cars average 18.9 mpg, 42 percent better than in 1973. Theaverage Italian car gets 30 mpg and in Japan the average is 31 mpg.   If U.S. cars _ nevermind trucks and buses _ did as well asItaly's, U.S. gasoline consumption in 1986 would have been about 28billion gallons or 25 percent less.   ``Triple the price of gasoline and usage would be cut in halfover time,'' said Mark Ross, a professor of physics at theUniversity of Michigan who is working on energy studies.   Last year's 94.8 cent average price for a gallon of unleadedregular was the lowest ever, after factoring out inflation.   Many Americans want big gains before doing anything. Severalstudies have shown that homeowners refuse storm windows and otherprojects offered by utilities if the payback takes longer than sixmonths.   Industries with reserves of engineering talent like chemicalsand electronics have made major strides. Dow Chemical Co. USArecorded a 40 percent reduction in energy needed to make a pound ofchemicals from 1972 to 1987.   But many are ignoring opportunities. It takes 25 million BTUsfor U.S. steel makers to produce a ton; Japan does it with 17million, said William Chandler, an analyst with the BatelleMemorial Institute's Washington office.   International Energy Agency figures show the United States ineighth place among 20 major countries in industrial efficiencygains from 1973 through 1985, behind Japan, Luxembourg, Britain,Germany, Denmark, Italy and Belgium, and fourth behind Canada,Norway and Luxembourg in use, measured by energy per dollar ofvalue added in manufacturing, mining, construction and agriculture.   Some gains stem from the decline of heavy industry. The IEAestimated that lower production accounted for 55 percent of thereduction in U.S. total industrial energy use from what it wouldhave been in 1983 if efficiency trends of the 1960s had continuedunchanged. That was a recession year and later figures are notavailable.   Overall, counting cars, buildings and everything, the UnitedStates still uses more energy per dollar than anybody but Canada.   The United States was 24 percent below Canada, but 22 percentabove third-place New Zealand, 97 percent above West Germany, 110percent above Japan and 144 percent above the best performer,Switzerland.   The 23 percent U.S. improvement over 1973 was bettered only byLuxembourg's 43 percent and Japan's 31 percent.   There are longer distances to drive in the United States, butChandler said geography and climate account for ``at most aquarter'' of the differences with Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
