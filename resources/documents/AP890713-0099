Christian Dornier killed his mother and sister and wounded hisfather Wednesday before getting in his car and driving aroundshooting at everyone in his path, police said. The dead includedseveral children.   Authorities said Dornier, who is about 30, wounded nine people,including a police captain, and was himself shot and wounded beforebeing captured.   Mayor Roger Clausse, whose 5-year-old niece was among thosekilled, said Dornier was believed angered by his elderly father'sdecision not to turn over to him management of the family farm inLuxiol, which is near the Swiss border.   He said funerals would be held Friday in this village of 128people and the nearby communities of Baumes-les-Dames, Verne andVoillans.   Street dances and fireworks displays scheduled inBaumes-les-Dames were canceled and will be replaced by a solemnceremony with placing of wreaths in memory of the victims.   All over France, the traditional July 14 celebrations were to beespecially lively this year in honor of the 200th anniversary of thestorming of the Bastille prison in the French Revolution.   A French anti-hunting group called for tighter controls onfirearms used by hunters, which are much easier to get than tightlyregulated handguns and other weapons. The Rally of Opponents toHunting issued a statement urging tougher laws on the possession ofhunting weapons that would ``take them away from people undermedical treatment and away from hunters out of season.''   The mayor's son, Joel Clausse, said today that he was upstairs athome when Dornier drove toward him shooting. He said he shot atDornier from an upstairs window with a rifle and wounded him, butnot badly enough to stop him.   ``I saw the blood spurting out of his neck,'' Joel Clausse said.Dornier then continued on until he was finally stopped by policegunfire in the village of Autechaux, 1.5 miles from Luxiol, themayor's son said.   The mayor said 40 officers had given chase.   Police said Dornier had been working on his father's farm. RogerClausse said Dornier was known in the village to be emotionallytroubled.   Archbishop Lucien Daloz from the nearby city of Besancon wasamong the mourners who came to visit the makeshift chapel at CityHall where the bodies of six of the victims were laid. Besides themayor's niece, a 10-year-old girl was also among the dead, policesaid.   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said a local policespokesman, whom it did not identify, called Dornier ``a huge man,solitary and wild, someone who inspires fear.''   Police at their regional headquarters in Besancon said the 14were killed by buckshot.   Georges Dornier, the suspect's uncle, said in a telephoneinterview Wednesday that his nephew was ``mildly depressive. I sawhim this morning, and he was very calm.''   A neighbor of Dornier, Marie-Therese Barraud, said she hid behinda wall as he fired shots into her kitchen. ``My husband, who wasoutside, was shot in the legs and the head. He's in the hospital,''she said by telephone.   ``I knew he was sick, he had shot at my husband once before,''Mrs. Barraud said of Dornier. ``Our neighbors advised us not to goout in our garden.''   A young woman reached by telephone in Luxiol said she heardgunshots that she thought at first were firecrackers.   ``Then a neighbor told me a black car was driving around thevillage and the driver was shooting at everybody,'' she said oncondition of anonymity. ``I went to tell the mayor. I saw an oldwoman lying on the ground dead.''   Premier Michel Rocard sent a telegram to the mayor of Luxioloffering condolences. The village is about 275 miles southeast ofParis.   The mass killing was the worst in memory for France. Death tollshave been higher in similar recent attacks in the United States andBritain.   In San Ysidro, Calif., James Huberty shot and killed 21 peopleand injured 19 others at a McDonald's restaurant on July 18, 1984.   On Aug. 19, 1987, in Hungerford in southwestern England, MichaelRyan killed 16 bystanders with an assault rifle and revolver beforehe was killed.   Under French gun-control regulations, a license is required tobuy a shotgun. Handguns and assault rifles, which are more tightlycontrolled, are very rare in this country.</TEXT></DOC>
