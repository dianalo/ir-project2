(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bankruptcy trustee for the PTLreligious complex said Friday he's ``very, very skeptical'' aboutwhether founder Jim Bakker will come up with the cash to back uphis $165 million offer for the ministry.   M.C. ``Red'' Benton told The Associated Press in a telephoneinterview from his Winston-Salem, N.C., home that he thinks theformer television evangelist does have a financial commitment from28 Greek businessmen who are supposed to be backing the deal.Bakker has not identified those businessmen even to Benton.   But he said Bakker seems to be having some trouble getting thecash into the United States. Benton had said Thursday that heexpected Bakker, who founded the television ministry and theme parkbut then left after admitting to extramarital sex, to sign acontract to buy PTL on Friday morning.   But the money was not available and legal details were not yetworked out, so Benton extended the deadline until Tuesday morning.   Bakker lawyer Ryan Hovis of Rock Hill, who met with PTLbankruptcy lawyers Friday at PTL's Heritage USA park, said therewere no ``serious snags'' in the negotiations and that a $3 millionletter of credit to back up Bakker's offer would be available byTuesday.   Hovis said the reason the contract wasn't signed Friday morningas previously announced is that a lot of legal details must betaken care of for such a large purchase.   PTL lawyers who met with Hovis on Friday declined comment on thenegotiations.   Benton said if the money isn't available by Tuesday, he'll beforced to consider other bids for the ministry's assets. He saidoffers of $120 million, $125 million and one ranging from $150million to $200 million have been made, as well as Canadian realestate executive Peter Thomas' standing offer of $113 million. Hedeclined to elaborate.   Benton has a deadline of Sept. 10 to recommend a buyer to U.S.Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.   ``We can't present anything to the judge if we do not have fulland complete assurance that he (Bakker) can fulfill thecommitment,'' Benton said. ``I am very, very skeptical aboutwhether he'll come up with the money.''   Reynolds has not indicated when he will choose a buyer for PTL,but he has said during court hearings that he's anxious to paycreditors and to keep Heritage USA operating.   Any involved parties could appeal Reynolds' choice of a buyer toU.S. District Court.   Benton said his job is to secure the deal that will pay the mostmoney to creditors, not to determine Bakker's chances of success.   Benton said if Bakker does come up with the cash and secures thedeal, he thinks things will be different this time around.   ``I think he would have a financial watchdog to keep him out oftrouble,'' he said. ``I really think he's learned his lesson.''   Bakker told The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer on Thursday that he'sconfident his new ministry _ New Covenant Partners Inc. _ willsucceed.   ``I see it as a chance to do some of the things better whereI've made mistakes and wrong decisions,'' Bakker said. ``There willstrict financial controls to make sure PTL lives within itsbudget.''</TEXT></DOC>
