Many writeoffs havebeen lost entirely because of higher thresholds on deductions formedical and miscellaneous expenses.   But there still are enough deductions left to make it worthwhilefor one-third of taxpayers to itemize.   One of the most expensive changes for individuals in the 1986 taxoverhaul was repeal of the deduction for state and local salestaxes. But state and local income and property taxes are stilldeductible.   Only unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7{ percent ofadjusted gross income may be deducted. Certain uninsurednon-business casualty losses, such as from fires, may be deductedsubject to a 10 percent threshold.   There is a 2 percent limit on miscellaneous deductions thatapplies to such things as unreimbursed employee expenses, includingunion dues, tools, work clothes (but not if suitable for streetwear), protective safety shoes and glasses; investment expenses,such as advice, subscriptions and rental of safe deposit boxes inwhich investment-related papers are stored, and tax-preparation fees.   1988 is the last year to deduct, subject to the 2 percent rule, aportion of the basic monthly home telephone service charge as anexpense of producing income.   Very few miscellaneous expenses may be deducted without regard tothe 2 percent threshold. These include certain work-related expensesof handicapped people and gambling losses up to the amount ofgambling winnings.   Some other deductions:   _ If you use your own car for the benefit of a tax-exemptcharity, including driving to and from the organization, you maydeduct 12 cents a mile or the cost of gas and oil, plus (in eithercase) parking fees and tolls.   _ On the other hand, driving your child to the hospital gets youa medical-expense deduction of only 9 cents a mile (or gas and oil)plus parking and tolls. These transportation expenses are lumped inwith other reimbursed medical expenses and subject to the 7{ percentthreshold.   Over the years, the definition of medical expenses has beenexpanded. In addition to such traditional costs as physicians' anddentists' fees and prescription drugs, the term can include a hairtransplant, drug-abuse treatment, a closed-caption television devicefor the deaf, a facelift, or even musical lessons prescribed tocorrect an overbite.   _ Use Form 1040 line 28 to report penalties paid for earlywithdrawal of savings; you won't be taxed on that amount.   _ If you itemize, you may be able to write off certain expensesincurred in connection with a job-related move if the new job is atleast 35 miles farther from your old home than was the old job. (Forexample, if your old job was three miles from home, you new job mustbe at least 38 miles from the old home.) If you had no previous job,the new job must be 35 miles or more from your old home. Publication521, free from the IRS, gives details.   _ Use Form 8283 to report gifts other than money to charity whenthe value exceeds $500. No breakdown is required on your return ifsuch gifts are $500 or less, but you would be wise to keep records.In general, you are allowed a deduction for contributions of moneyor ordinary-income property (as opposed to property that couldproduce a capital gain) up to 30 percent of your adjusted grossincome.   _ Non-business losses due to fire, theft, storm and similarevents may be deductible; misplacing or breaking a valuable item isnot a deductible loss. After absorbing the first $100 of each loss,you may deduct only the total amount of all losses in a year thatexceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income. See Form 4684.   Here are some expenses that are not deductible: scientology fees,funeral expenses, health club dues, the value of your servicesdonated to charity, fines, termite or moth damage, over-the-counterdrugs even if prescribed, diaper service, gifts to foreigncharities, child support, and costs of commuting from home to work.</TEXT></DOC>
