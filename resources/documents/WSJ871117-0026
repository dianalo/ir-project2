Tokyo share prices rose, but volume was extremely low as most investors stayed out of the market awaiting concrete news about a deficit-reduction package.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which rose 901.75 points Friday, gained 167.18 points to finish the afternoon session at 22615.43.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index rose 11.34 points to 1854.07. Turnover in the first section was estimated at a very light 300 million shares, down from 600 million shares Friday.    At the end of the morning session Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei stood at 22468.68, down 146.75.    Traders Monday said the Nikkei largely preserved its gains following a bullish morning open, though turnover increasingly diminished. Insurance shares spearheaded the advance, gaining 2.9% in value, while the service industry followed, rising 2.7%. Brokerage firms also performed well, moving up 2.1%. Export-led shares were mixed all day, reflecting only scattered investor interest.    In insurance issues, Sumitomo Marine gained 20 yen to 1,090 ($8), and Taisho Marine edged up 1 to 931.    In leading brokerages, Nikko Securities surged 90 to 1,790. Yamaichi Securities rose 60 to 1,750, and Nomura Securities rose 40 to 3,440.    In the service industries, Secom, Japan's leading private security agency, rose 100 to 6,200. One broker said the focus on such domestic-incentive stocks reflected selective buying by investors seeking laggard shares.    In export-led issues, blue-chip electricals were spotty, despite the dollar's somewhat stronger movements.    Traders were optimistic Japanese share prices will move higher this week on selective buying as negotiations on a U.S. budget deficit-cutting package near an expected conclusion. One observer, though, cautioned that local investors will stay sidelined until the package's specific contents are known.    In London, share prices shed most of their gains in a final-hour tumble in response to a speech by President Reagan that traders believed cast fresh doubt on the prospect of a significant deficit reduction package.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed 8.5 points higher at 1325.6. The index had been up as much as 45.6 points. Volume totaled a fairly active 704.8 million shares, up from 591.8 million Friday. The 100-share index closed 6.4 points higher at 1684.7, the day's lowest level.    In a speech to a life insurance trade group, Mr. Reagan said the U.S. runs a distinct risk if it tries to calm financial markets by taking the wrong action. He also appeared less optimistic on the budget deficit talks, saying he was confident the fiscal 1988 deficit will be cut at least $23 billion. Some investors thought the use of the $23 billion figure represented a retreat from his statement Saturday that the budget negotiators were seeking a $30 billion cut, but the White House said Mr. Reagan didn't intend to give that impression.    The speech disappointed many London participants, who are looking for a package to cut the 1988 deficit $30 billion and to include a tax increase, the head of market-making at one major British firm said. The speech also provided a good excuse to take profits after London's strong rebound in the previous four days, which had boosted the 100-share index 113.1 points, he added.    &quot;You can see how fragile confidence still is,&quot; he said.    New shares in British Petroleum topped the most active list amid rumors of strong foreign buying. The new shares rose 1 penny to a partly paid price of 80 pence each, while regular BP shares gained 3 pence to 250 pence. ($4.43) Rolls-Royce fell 5 to 114. It said foreign investors held about 20.7% of its shares, above the 15% ceiling set by the government, and sent notices to holders of 5.7% requiring them to sell by Jan. 11.    Banks were mixed with Barclays Bank down 7 at 443, Lloyds Bank down 7 at 243 and National Westminster Bank off 12 at 563. Midland Bank rose 5 to 393, and Standard Chartered rose 10 to 443.    Prices of West German shares traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange retreated from a strong opening to close mixed amid doubts that the dollar would be able to hold overnight gains, brokers said.    The dollar's climb to more than 1.71 marks over the weekend had spurred buying of West German shares. A higher dollar boosts growth prospects for the country's export-linked economy. The rise came amid optimism about the possibility of an agreement to reduce the U.S. budget deficit.    But by midsession, confidence in the dollar's strength was shaky and investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude, brokers said.    Gainers were led by the classic export issues among automobile, chemical and electrical issues. Daimler-Benz and Bayerische Motoren Werke were up 5 marks each to 710 and 455 marks, respectively, while Volkswagen gained 8.2 to 275 ($162).    Chemical stock Bayer gained 4.5 to 279. Hoechst was up 4.5 to 255.5, and BASF gained 4.5 to 258. Schering gained 3 to 403.    Among electrical stocks, Siemens rose 7 marks to 408.5, while AEG gained 11.3 to 244.3.    Stock prices rose on other Asian and European exchanges, climbing in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan.    In Singapore, share prices climbed in light trading in line with other regional bourses, partly on hope of an agreement to cut the U.S. budget deficit. The recovery in Singapore remains uncertain, brokers said. Local institutions did most of the buying in blue-chip issues, and foreign players were still conspicuously absent.    Share prices in Paris ended higher in active trading, buoyed by expectations of a breakthrough in the budget negotiations. The dollar's recovery in Europe also contributed to the market's firm tone.
