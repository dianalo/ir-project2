Chairman Lee Iacocca receivedabout $3.7 million and future stock options from the nation'sthird-largest automaker last year, down from $17.9 million in 1987,according to the company's proxy statement released Friday.   The main reason for the big decline was that Iacocca exercisedfar fewer stock options in 1988 than he did the previous year.   In 1987, Iacocca exercised $13.5 million worth of stock options,while stock options represented about $2.2 million of what Iacoccareceived in 1988.   His salary, benefits and earnings incentives for 1988 were only1.7 percent less than what he received the previous year.   The proxy statement is being mailed to shareholders in advanceof Chrysler's annual meeting set for May 18 in San Francisco.   In a statement Friday, UAW President Owen Bieber and VicePresident Marc Stepp, head of the union's Chrysler Department, saidthe executive salaries ``continue to send a message reflectingmisplaced priorities.''   ``There can be no possible justification for the excessivesalaries, bonuses and receipts from stock transactions reported intoday's proxy statement,'' Bieber and Stepp said in a preparedstatement.   Last year, Stepp called the payments announced just before theunion and the company sat down at the bargaining table ``anincredible ripoff.''   Chrysler is the first of the Big Three automakers to release its1988 proxy statement. Ford Motor Co. is expected to release itsstatement next week, and General Motors Corp.'s is due after that.   The statement said Iacocca, 64, received about $1.47 million insalary and 1987 incentive payments, $2.2 million in stocks or stockoptions exercised and $12,000 in company contributions to a savingsplan.   In addition, the statement said Iacocca will become eligible forseveral other stock option plans at the end of 1990 and 1991, whenIacocca's current contract expires. Those options, if exercised,could bring him $18.1 million at the end of 1990 and another$630,000 at the end of 1991.   Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, the likely successor toIacocca, received $1.2 million in salary, benefits and stocks;Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Bennett Bidwell received $1.2million; Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz received $979,256,and Executive Vice President for Finance Robert Miller received$902,453, the proxy statement said.   In addition, the top five officers also received stock optionrights, with various redemption values depending on the time thestock is held, to shares valued at $25.88 each. Iacocca receivedsuch options on 120,000 shares; Greenwald, 75,000; Bidwell andLutz, 60,000; and Miller, 45,000.   Chrysler's top 22 officers received $12.9 million in salaries,bonuses and incentives during 1988, an average of $584,760 each.   The company earned $1.05 billion in 1988, down from $1.29billion the year before. By comparison, Ford reported $5.3 billionin profits last year, and GM said it earned $4.86 billion in 1988.   The UAW said in its statement that workers and consumers werelosing patience with automobile company executives' highcompensation levels.   ``Today, with domestic market share continuing to fall in theface of mounting import an transplant sales,'' the statement said,``it is simply unconscionable to assume the kind of `business asusual' posture reflected in the compensation awards disclosedtoday.''   The UAW said Iacocca's salary worked out to a little more than$416 an hour, 29 times more than that of a typical assembler. Addon to that stock options and bonuses, the union said, and Iacocca'ssalary rises to 119 times that of the assembler.   The union praised Chrysler's cut-rate financing incentivesdesigned to increase sales and its trade efforts in Washington.But, UAW asked, ``Why do they have such an enormous blind spot whenit comes to their own affairs?''</TEXT></DOC>
