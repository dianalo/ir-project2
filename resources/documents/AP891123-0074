There was no official confirmation from NASA or the Pentagon,but sources close to the project said the 2{-ton, $300 millionpayload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay about 10 hoursafter Wednesday night's liftoff.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thesatellite was designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and listenin on military and diplomatic communications in the Soviet Unionand other countries.   A military-imposed news blackout surrounding the flightcontinued today, the five crew members' first full day in orbit.   They were to have a late Thanksgiving dinner of turkey andcranberry sauce. Because of the night launch, their schedule hadthem sleeping until after noon EST.   The beginning of the classified mission was anything but secretas Discovery blasted off at 7:23 p.m. from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,carving a spectacular fiery path across the heavens.   People at the launch site could see it for more than 600 miles.   ``It was gorgeous. It was a bright, bright orangy sky,'' saidDorothy Flores of Winter Park.   The dark sky over the central Florida coast turned bright as theshuttle lifted almost straight up and headed over the Atlantic.   ``We are delighted with the results,'' said Forrest McCartney,director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``It's something thatAmericans can be proud and thankful for on Thanksgiving.''   The liftoff was only the third after dark, and the time wasdictated by the secret cargo and its mission. The shuttle's ascentprovided a spectacular view over a large part of Florida, butclouds obscured the visibility for the rest of the Southeast.   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,a television reporter in Miami, 200 miles south of the launchcenter.   ``It looked like a Roman candle,'' over the city's Biscayne Bay,she said.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration providedlaunch commentary until Discovery reached orbit nine minutes afterliftoff. The broadcast system then fell silent until 2{ hourslater, when Mission Control commentator Billie Deason issued abrief status report.   ``The crew of Discovery has been given the go for orbitoperations. The orbiter and crew are performing well,'' Ms. Deasonsaid.   The satellite is to be put in orbit 22,300 miles over theequator, with line-of-sight to the Soviet Union, China, the MiddleEast, Africa and all of Europe. A similar satellite was released ona shuttle flight in 1985.   Unless a problem occurs, the official silence is expected tocontinue throughout the flight, except when NASA gives a 24-houradvance notice of the shuttle's landing.   The flight, the fifth dedicated entirely to the military, isexpected to last four days. Landing will be at Edwards Air ForceBase, Calif.   According to military officials, the secrecy is needed to makeit more difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spyship off Cape Canaveral to track the shuttle.   But critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedlyknew much about the mission before it launched and are keepingtrack of Discovery as it orbits Earth.   To celebrate the holiday today, a fairly traditionalThanksgiving meal consisting of turkey and gravy, cranberry sauceand pumpkin bread was packed aboard the shuttle for the crewmembers.   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory, who waspilot of the shuttle Challenger on a 1985 flight. Gregory is thefirst black astronaut to command a shuttle mission.   Discovery's pilot is Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, who is makinghis second flight this year. He replaced astronaut S. David Griggs,who was killed while practicing stunt flying in June for an airshow.   The others crew members are mission specialists F. StoryMusgrave, Navy Capt. Manley ``Sonny'' Carter Jr. and Kathryn C.Thornton.</TEXT></DOC>
