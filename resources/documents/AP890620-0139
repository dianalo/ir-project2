On a voice vote, the House authorized the Energy Department tocontinue filling the reserve with 60,000 to 78,000 barrels of oildaily through next February, but postponed decisions on several keyissues on how the stockpile may be used.   The Senate approved similar legislation two weeks ago, butextended the program for another five years and raised the ceilingon the reserve from 750 million barrels to 1 billion barrels earlyin the next century.   In response to oil price surges after the Exxon Valdez tankerspill in Alaska two months ago, the Senate also expanded PresidentBush's authority to tap the reserve for domestic as well as foreignsupply interruptions.   The House included none of those measures in its bill, saying itwanted to give its Energy and Commerce Committee as well as theEnergy Department time to weigh the implications of any new policydirections.   If the Senate refuses to accept the House-passed bill, aconference committee would be named to develop a compromise version.If both chambers approve the compromise, the legislation would besent to Bush.   While endorsing the effort to give Bush more authority andflexibility on when he could tap the reserve in order to suppresssudden price spikes for oil, the administration had sought only asimple five-year extension of the program.   Since the reserve was begun in 1975, some 570 million barrels ofoil _ slightly less than a 90-day supply of U.S. imports at currentlevels _ have been put into storage in salt caverns on the Texas andLouisiana coasts.</TEXT></DOC>
