A meeting last evening between Sen. John Danforth (R.,Mo.), the chief sponsor of the pending civil rights bill, andWhite House Counsel C. Boyden Gray failed to resolve theirdifferences. The result, Sen. Danforth said, was that hisbill appeared unlikely to garner the 67 votes needed tooverride a still-expected veto by President Bush.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's a chance,&quot; Sen. Danforth said after the meeting.But he added, &quot;I wouldn't bet a lot of dough on it.&quot;   &quot;The issues that remain have been around for some time,&quot;he said. &quot;If anybody has any ideas, they'd better startmoving on them fast.&quot; Debate on the bill is expected to begintoday.   Mr. Gray left Mr. Danforth's office and tried to avoidreporters. &quot;We're talking, we're talking,&quot; he said, and addedthat there was &quot;no resolution.&quot;   Both Sen. Dole of Kansas and Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.)have in recent days proposed compromise language to the WhiteHouse, but the administration has thus far adhered to itsposition that it will favor only its own version of the bill.The discussions have focused chiefly on circumstances inwhich employers may justify as &quot;business necessity&quot; practicesthat indirectly discriminate.   &quot;There may be some who just don't want a bill,&quot; said Sen.Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.), who has also tried to bridgedifferences with Sen. Danforth over the bill. &quot;Most peopleare beginning to get very weary with the issue.&quot;   Separately, Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said he willintroduce an amendment extending coverage of the job biasbill to members of the Senate. Under his proposal, employeesalleging discrimination by members of Congress could taketheir complaints initially to the Senate Ethics Committee,and ultimately to federal court.   Similar proposals previously stirred much Senateopposition on the grounds they violate the constitutionalseparation of powers. But Sen. Grassley said he believes&quot;there's a different environment at the grass roots&quot; now.   In addition, Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) said he wouldintroduce an amendment to allow unlimited punitive damages towomen and disabled people who suffer employmentdiscrimination, including sexual harassment. Currently,unlimited damages are available only to victims of racediscrimination.   Sen. Danforth's bill would allow women and disabled peopleto receive a limited amount of damages, determined by thesize of the company they are suing.</TEXT></DOC>
