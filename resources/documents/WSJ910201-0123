To be sure, Congress can check the president, as it didwith the nomination of Robert Bork. But in the long run thepresident will prevail. One sees that today, as one nomineeafter another exhibits the &quot;judicial restraint&quot; that was themark of the Bork vision.</LP><TEXT>   In a Dec. 31 page one article, Washington's Legal Timesobserved that the Bush judges, like their Reaganpredecessors, &quot;have articulated in their confirmationproceedings and in their rulings bedrock conservativedoctrine: literal interpretation of statutory andconstitutional texts, deep skepticism of claims for newrights, reluctance to reach questions not acutely presentedby the case at hand, and regular deference to executive andlaw-enforcement power.&quot; To this list one should add anabiding deference to the legislature -- the legacy of the NewDeal Supreme Court.   Not all of the Republican appointees are of the restraintpersuasion, of course. In a recent Ninth Circuit decision,for example, two Reagan appointees, Alex Kozinski and JohnNoonan, had no difficulty siding with the majority in findingthat an amendment to the California state constitutionprohibiting political parties from endorsing candidates forjudgeships amounted to an infringement of free speech. (Bycontrast, two Bush appointees, Pamela Rymer and FerdinandFernandez, deferred to the legislature.) And another Reaganappointee, Judge Pasco Bowman of the Eighth Circuit, recentlytold a packed audience at the Cato Institute that theConstitution protects economic liberties no less than othercivil rights -- a view that the judicial restraint schoolabandoned in the wake of the New Deal. For the most part,however, it is judicial restraint that drives the Reagan-Bushjudges.   In print for barely a year, then, Mr. Bork's &quot;The Temptingof America,&quot; can already be said to have carried the day.Less charitably, one could say that his target, &quot;judicialactivism,&quot; has passed him by. For the activism of the WarrenCourt is today hardly to be found. That gives liberals pause,of course. But it should give conservatives pause as well,not simply because Congress and the bureaucracy have onlyoccasionally come under conservative control, but because,more deeply, the natural tendency of the political branchesis toward growth in government.   Thus conservatives and classical liberals alike -- indeed,anyone who favors limited government and a wide range of bothpersonal and economic liberties -- should be concerned whenthe third branch of government effectively withdraws from thescene. The dangers of popular tyranny were well known to theFounders. They recognized the tendency of &quot;factions,&quot; whethermajoritarian or special interest, to use government for theirown ends, expanding the state in the process. It was for thisreason that they drafted a written constitution and createdan independent judiciary to interpret it -- a judiciary thatwas meant, as James Madison put it, to be &quot;the bulwark of ourliberties.&quot;   Yet how can a judiciary dedicated to restraint be &quot;thebulwark of our liberties&quot;? To be sure, an unrestrainedjudiciary is no bulwark either -- that is why we have aconstitution, and why Mr. Bork's critique of the excesses of&quot;judicial activism&quot; is perfectly correct. But it is no answerto the perennial problem of securing ordered liberty to askthe judiciary to serve as handmaiden to the other branches.Too often that is precisely what judicial &quot;deference&quot; amountsto. When courts extend a presumption of constitutionality tostatutes and executive actions, they simply buy into themajoritarianism that grew out of the Progressive Era. Thatmajoritarianism was no part of the original design. On thecontrary, the Founders took every step to protect ourliberties, even from the majority -- indeed, especially fromthe majority.   If they are serious about liberty, then, conservativesneed to rethink their position on judicial restraint. Andwhat better place to begin than with Mr. Bork's centralvision -- wrongly ascribed to Madison: America's &quot;firstprinciple is self-government, which means that in wide areasof life majorities are entitled to rule, if they wish, simplybecause they are majorities.&quot; Its second principle, Mr. Borkcontinues, is &quot;that there are nonetheless some thingsmajorities must not do to minorities, some areas of life inwhich the individual must be free of majority rule.&quot;   That gets the Madisonian vision exactly backward.America's first political principle may indeed have beenself-government, but its first moral principle -- and thereason the people instituted government at all -- wasindividual liberty, as the Declaration of Independence makesplain for &quot;a candid world&quot; to see.   Indeed, America did not throw off a king only to enable amajority to do what no king would ever dare. No, the Foundersinstituted a plan whereby in &quot;wide areas&quot; individuals wouldbe entitled to be free simply because they were born soentitled, while in &quot;some&quot; areas majorities would be entitledto rule not because they were inherently so entitled but as apractical compromise.   That gets the order right: individual liberty first;self-government second, as a means toward securing thatliberty -- with wide berths to state governments, to be sure.That is why the Constitution enumerated the powers ofCongress and the executive, to limit them. And that, afterall, is why the Bill of Rights concludes with the Ninth andTenth amendments: to make clear that Americans begin and endwith their rights, enumerated and unenumerated alike.   The judiciary, then, must not shirk its duty to securethose rights by deferring to the political branches in thename of &quot;self-government.&quot; Rather, it must hold the acts ofthe other branches up to the light of strict constitutionalscrutiny. There is no place for &quot;restraint&quot; in this. Nor, ofcourse, is there any place for the kind of &quot;activism&quot; thattakes the judge beyond the Constitution. That document,however, is rich enough to enable the judge to discover therights that are there to be discovered. To do that he muststart with the text, of course. But where the text is broador unclear he will have to go behind the document to theoriginal understanding, including the theory of naturalrights that informed that understanding, giving meaning tothe text and legitimacy to the document as a whole. This isnot unwarranted &quot;activism.&quot; It is what judges are appointedto do.   In this regard, Judge Bowman's remarks were particularlyon point. For not only did he speak of natural rights toproperty and contract, which he located in the Constitution,but he called into question a pair of judicial shibbolethsinvented by the New Deal Court that are subscribed to todayby liberals and conservatives alike: the idea that there aretwo &quot;classes&quot; of rights, &quot;fundamental&quot; (like freedom ofspeech) and &quot;nonfundamental&quot; (like freedom of contract); andtwo standards by which to review laws or acts purporting toviolate those rights, &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; and &quot;minimalscrutiny,&quot; respectively.   It is no small irony that those New Deal doctrines are atthe core of conservatives' &quot;judicial restraint&quot; approach --with its reliance on text and original understanding,misconstrued as majoritarianism -- for they are nowhere to befound in either text or original understanding. On thecontrary, they fly in the face of both.   It is time, then, for conservatives to return to theirroots, which are located not in the majoritarianism of theProgressive Era, much less in the judicial inventions of theNew Deal, but in the vision of the founding. That visionbegins with individual liberty. It secures that liberty byconstituting a government of separated and divided powers.And it subjects those powers to the principled scrutiny of anindependent judiciary.   Restraint in the exercise of that scrutiny is worse thanout of place. It undermines the original design, enabling thepolitical branches to move into the vacuum, which of courseis precisely what they have done. The irony is thatconservatives, properly opposing the politicization of thelaw by the courts, have enabled our law to be politicizednonetheless through their misplaced restraint. The time hascome to rethink &quot;judicial restraint&quot; and restore thejudiciary to its rightful place in a system of separatedpowers.   ---   Mr. Pilon, a senior official in the Departments of Stateand Justice during the Reagan administration, is the directorof the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies.</TEXT></DOC>
