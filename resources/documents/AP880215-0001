President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Zaid Rifaiof Jordan separately outlined that position in remarks toreporters. Rifai arrived in Cairo Monday for a one-day visit.   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz will visit the Middle Eastat the end of this month.   Officials in Washington and Israel have said a new U.S. peaceplan was outlined to Arab and Israeli leaders by Richard Murphy,the assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs.   The Egyptian president visited Washington last month and heldtalks in Cairo with Murphy last week. However, Mubarak said: ``TheAmericans have not given us a specific (peace) plan.''   ``But we have taken the position that any plan must clearlyinclude: first, an overall settlement of the problem and, second,an international conference as a framework without any attempt tooutflank it.''   For any peace plan to succeed, Mubarak said, it must envisage``the final outcome, and we must stay away from any words orprovisions that were in the Camp David agreements because they areoutdated and finished.''   He referred to an autonomy plan outlined in one of theU.S.-mediated 1978 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel. Itprovided for an interim arrangement under which the 1.5 millionPalestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, captured by Israel in 1967,would exercise self-rule for five years.   The plan also provided that negotiations begin not later thanthe third year of autonomy to consider the final status of the twoterritories.   Reports from Washington and Jerusalem last week said a two-stageplan carried by Murphy suggested an accelerated version of the CampDavid formula.   The reports said the plan proposed talks, to be held underinternational sponsorship, on limited Palestinian self-rule as aninterim measure. Those talks would begin in April and negotiationson the final status of the two territories would be held inDecember, the reports said.   After his 90-minute meeting with Mubarak, Rifai said that Jordanopposed ``partial solutions or projects for self-rule'' in the WestBank and Gaza. Jordan wants a final settlement through aninternational conference, he added.   The state-owned Middle East News Agency reported that Rifaicarried a message to Mubarak from King Hussein. Rifai did notcomment on any message.   The Washington reports suggested that Shultz's tour will be tosell the two-stage plan to Arab and Israeli leaders.   Mubarak's remarks on Monday appeared to reflect seriousreservations about the reported plan.   ``Shultz is coming and if he is bringing proposals to offer tothe parties concerned, I hope they will keep away from Camp Davidand will cover a final solution,'' he said.   He said an international conference ``would give all partiesconfidence.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes an internationalconference, contending it would pressure Israel into makingterritorial concessions.   If a peace plan does not seek a final settlement through aninternatiuonal conference, Mubarak said, ``the consequences willnot be good.   ``I do not wish for any initiative to fail. I wish for aninitiative that aims for a final solution establishing just peacein the region.''   Rifai reiterated Jordan's demand for a United Nations-sponsoredinternational conference with the participation of the SecurityCouncil's five permanent members and all concerned parties,including the Palestine Liberation Organization.   ``We are against any plan dealing with partial solutions orprojects for self-rule. We seek a final settlement ... Ourassessment of any initiative will depend on how close it comes tothe position I have stated.''   Since Palestinian demonstrations against Israeli rule broke outDec. 8, more than 50 Arabs have died of Israeli gunfire.</TEXT></DOC>
