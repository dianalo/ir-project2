 The wiring that connectsPCs in a LAN is expensive to put in and difficult to maintain, and it seemsnever to go to the right place at the right time.andM;The obvious answer to LAN cabling woes is to create a network that doesn'trely on wires at all, and a handful of new products do just that, usingspreadspectrum radio technology or infrared transmissions.andM;To the uninitiated, wireless LANs may seem like an unnecessary extravagance.andO;But networked PCs must often go where cable can't easily follow--out ontoshop floors or between buildings on an office campus.andP;  Even in new buildingswhere the job is relatively simple, cable is expensive to install.andO;Retrofitting existing buildings is even more costly.andM;Worst of all, the job is never done.andP;  &quot;Companies move their workers who usecomputers about every two years,&quot; says Dick Allen, president of Photonics,maker of the Photolink infrared wireless network.andP;  &quot;And in rapidly growingcompanies the rate can be as high as every six months, so the cost ofrelocating cables for networks can be the most expensive part of networkownership.&quot;andP;  In addition, experts trace as much as 70 to 90 percent of LANfailures back to cabling problems.andM;From Battlefield to LANandM;Spread-spectrum radio was developed by the military in the 1940s as a way toget around enemy jamming of radio transmissions.andP;  Rather than trying tooverpower the jamming signal by broadcasting a very high energy signal withina narrow frequency band, spread-spectrum technology sends out low-powersignals across a wide range of frequencies.andM;Over the years, spread-spectrum radio has been used in radar systems, theNavstar oceanic navigation system, and NASA deep-space communications.andP;  In1985 the Federal Communications Commission set aside a frequency range forcommercial spread-spectrum use.andM;Today, the same properties that make spread-spectrum radio immune to jammingalso make it effective for carrying network communications in steel-framedoffice buildings, which soak up conventional radio signals.andP;  With a widespectrum of frequencies, the signal can always find a way to get through.andM;The Grass IsandM;GreenerandM;The easiest way to use spread-spectrum technology is with LAWN (which standsfor Local Area Wireless Network), from O'Neill Communications.andM;The LAWN system is designed to make it easy to connect small groups of PCsfor printer sharing, file transfers, and electronic mail, and to keep thatconnection up and running through all the cycles of business life.andP;  Moves tonew offices, growth of the group, and changes in membership pose no challengeto a low-maintenance LAWN.andP;  Menu-driven software installation and backgrounddata transmission are meant to make the system painless to set up and use.andM;The LAWN transceiver box, slightly bigger than an external modem, attaches toa serial port and comes in three flavors--one for PCs, one for printers andplotters, and one for modems.andM;The LAWN's networking software runs as a TSR that lives in 40K of RAM.andP;  TheLAWN moves data at an effective rate of 9,000 bps, which means it's nonetwork speed demon but is certainly fast enough for its intended uses.andM;The LAWN network works peer-to-peer--there's no dedicated file server--on oneof four selectable channels within the available radio frequencies, so fournetworks could run side-by-side without interference.andP;  It is intended tohandle about 20 users scattered across 10,000 square feet of turf.andP;  Inunobstructed areas, LAWN devices can be as far as 500 feet from one another,and additional LAWN units can function as repeaters to extend that range.andM;The Standard SolutionandM;For companies that need the horsepower of server-based networks and NovellNetWare compatibility, Telesystems SLW last fall introduced the ARLAN 450, aNetWare-compatible spreadspectrum radio network card.andP;  The 450 is athree-quarter-size PC board that combines a packet-data transceiver with anetwork interface.andP;  A stubby 3-inch antenna screws onto the card's spine toconnect it to the outside world.andM;The packet data scheme uses error-checking for reliability and dataencryption to keep network communications secure.andP;  The wireless LAN systemruns at 230Kbps--not as fast as cabled Ethernet or token-ring LANs, but inthe same class as a number of widely used proprietary networks, such asApple's LocalTalk.andM;While the ARLAN 450 card's $1,500 price tag is several times the cost of aconventional network adapter, Ken Howarth, Telesystems' director of sales,insists that the cost per network node is competitive with that oftraditional cabled networks when all expenses are taken into account.andP;  Alarge Canadian company that uses the ARLAN found that it costs $500 to $800per workstation to install a network in a new building, twice that toretrofit an older building, and $2,000 to $3,000 every time it needs to movea workstation.andM;&quot;That includes a lot of costs that people don't usually think about,&quot; Howarthexplains, &quot;like all the time spent on defining the wiring requirements andplanning the move--and the lost productivity during moves.&quot;andM;Green Light for Red LightandM;Spread spectrum is not the only way to go wireless.andP;  Like a big brother to aVCR remote control, Photonics' Photolink uses infrared light to carry datasignals.andP;  Photolinks will eventually be available for several networkprotocols.andP;  The first one on the market is designed for use with Apple'sLocalTalk networks of Macintoshes and PCs; a second version, for RS-232interfaces, has an add-on concentrator that enables the Photolink to handleterminal-to-host mainframe communications.andM;The Photolink was bred for the modern office environment.andP;  A bracket allowsit to sit on top of the movable partitions between cubicles, common inopen-floor-plan offices.andP;  Four Macs (or PCs equipped with LocalTalk cardssuch as Apple's AppleTalk PC card or the TOPS FlashCard) can connect to eachPhotolink with standard telephone extension cables and RJ-11 jacks.andM;The Photolink's $995 price cuts the cost of switching from a cabled LocalTalknetwork to about $250 per workstation.andM;Infrared transmission requires the send/receive heads of all the Photolinkunits to have line-of-sight access to a common wall or ceiling--the signalwon't pass through walls or between floors as will spread-spectrum radiowaves.andP;  (Transmission is not affected if a person walks between a unit andthe wall.)andP;  Connecting workstations without line-of-sight access to thenetwork requires mixing infrared with old-fashioned hardwiring.andP;  ButPhotonics' Allen foresees a bright future for infrared connections:&quot;Two-thirds of the office workers in the United States work in open officeareas,&quot; he says, &quot;so there's a lot of cable we can eliminate.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
