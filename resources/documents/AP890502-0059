U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said the aliens were denieda chance to seek political asylum.   Kenyon ruled that the U.S. Immigration and NaturalizationService violated his previous order to provide help to Salvadoransat the Port Isabel Service Processing Center.   ``Out of a group of 67 Salvadorans deported from Port Isabel onApril 20, none was represented by counsel at their deportationhearings,'' he said in his preliminary injunction issued Friday andmade public Monday. ``The court finds it difficult to believe thateach of these individuals learned of and knowingly and effectivelywaived his or her right to counsel.''   Kenyon also ordered the INS to hold group presentations advisingthe detention center inmates of their rights.   Last month, an attorney for the Los Angeles-based CentralAmerican Refugee Center sought an order requiring that legalcounsel be provided the immigrants.   Activists had argued that a stepped-up enforcement program hadled to the detention of thousands of people at Port Isabel, andthat many faced deportation hearings without legally-requiredaccess to a lawyer.   Kenyon's order remains in effect pending a May 30 hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
