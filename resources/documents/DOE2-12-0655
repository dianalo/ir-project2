The solution has the characteristics of nonlinearinstability in Lagrangian coordinates; the fluid velocity and the Alfvenspeed on each magnetic loop increases exponentially with time, becausethe loop is evacuated by the field aligned motion of matter due to gravitationalacceleration. 10 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
