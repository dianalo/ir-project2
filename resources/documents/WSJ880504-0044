Bothell, Wash.-based Pacer said the termination follows a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by another suitor, Wembley PLC of London, indicating the British concern had increased its Pacer stake to 47% from 38% last week.    Pacer, which makes automated movie-theater management information, admissions and concession equipment, signed a definitive agreement with Ticketmaster in January. But before shareholders could vote on the proposed merger, Wembley took a substantial stake and has since made overtures while continuing to increase its holdings.    Pacer said it paid $450,000 to Ticketmaster under a termination agreement, and will pay as much as $150,000 in expenses. Pacer warned that Wembley hasn't yet obligated itself to buy any more shares, and said there's &quot;no assurance&quot; current talks will result in a definitive agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
