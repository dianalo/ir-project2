Byrd,D-W.Va., said today it would be unwise to threaten to pull U.S.troops out of Europe to counter pressures inside West Germany forthe removal of all nuclear weapons from German soil.   ``The appearance of the use of threats by the United States doesthe Germans a disservice,'' Byrd said in testimony prepared fordelivery before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``Threatening Europe with a diminished American commitment ifEurope does not undertake certain specific actions would becounterproductive,'' the Senate leader said.   Byrd said that the Senate delegation he led to Europe earlierthis month concluded that ``no responsible German officialcontemplates denuclearizing Germany.''   Some West Germans do advocate eliminating all U.S. nuclearsystems in the aftermath of the successful negotiation of theU.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons fromthe continent.   But Byrd said most West German leaders reject that as a stepleading to domination by Moscow's superior weight in non-nucleararms such as tanks, artillery and aircraft.   Byrd said the top priority for NATO now must be the forging of adetailed and comprehensive proposal on conventional arms reductionto present to the Soviet Union this year.   On Tuesday, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger saidPresident Reagan's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons isneither obtainable nor desirable.   ``I do not believe this is possible and I do not believe ourleaders should create the impression that it is possible, let alonedesirable,'' he said.   Kissinger said he was concerned about the West being exposed toSoviet superiority in conventional weapons should nuclear weaponsbe abolished.   Kissinger told the committee he believes the Senate shouldratify the new treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons inEurope, if only to avoid a bruising and divisive political upheavalinside the NATO alliance.   But Kissinger said he believes the treaty is ``flawed and leavesus in a weaker position, both politically and militarily.''   He said he was especially troubled by the treaty's reduction ofU.S. and Soviet missiles to zero on each side because of theexpectations that may create in the negotiation of a treatyreducing long-range strategic nuclear arms.   ``It implies that zero in all categories is obtainable, and itis not obtainable,'' Kissinger said.   He said the treaty should be ratified, if for no other reason,because keeping a force of U.S. Pershing and ground-launched cruisemissiles in Western Europe is now politically impossible.   The treaty is the result of NATO's 1979 ``dual-track'' decisionto deploy U.S. weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-rangemissiles while at the same time negotiating their removal.   It calls for the destruction of all missiles with a range from300 miles to 3,400 miles.   Kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it willnot reduce in any significant way the ability of the Soviet Unionto devastate Europe with other nuclear weapons and because itsubstantially reduces the ability of the United States to retaliatewith nuclear weapons based in Europe.   Nuclear deterrence in Europe will now rely primarily on weaponsbased in the United States and Kissinger said that creates ``apsychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighedagainst Soviet superiority in conventional forces.</TEXT></DOC>
