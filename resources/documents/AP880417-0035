The department's Energy Information Administration said oilprices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected inlast year's forecast, and natural gas prices will be much lower.   The import share of U.S. petroleum consumption won't be muchdifferent at the end of the century from what was predicted lastyear, EIA said.   In their annual forecast released last week, the agency'sforecasters significantly raised prediction for U.S. crude oilproduction in the year 2000 from 5.4 million barrels a day to 6.0million barrels. Last year's production was about 8.3 millionbarrels compared with 9.0 million barrels before the 1986 petroleumprice collapse.   Richard Farmer, in charge of the petroleum forecast, said in aninterview Friday, ``There is no way you can avoid a decline'' inU.S. production by the year 2000. Any major discoveries offCalifornia or in Alaska, areas where explorers have high hopes,could not be in significant production before then, he said.   ``We have been significantly influenced here'' by the work ofWilliam Fisher, chairman of the Department of Geological Sciencesat the University of Texas at Austin, Farmer said.   Fisher reported last year that drilling efficiencies or findingrates _ barrels of oil per foot of exploratory well drilled _ havebeen remarkably stable, instead of declining as many predicted.   Farmer, using slightly different calculations than Fisher, saiddrillers are finding 25 barrels of crude oil per foot drilled, andhave been finding between 25 and 30 barrels for the past 10 years.   In 1986, the most recent year for which full drilling statisticsare available, drilling dropped off drastically. But efficiency``didn't change much,'' and may have blipped upward as the leasteffective drilling rigs were idled, Farmer said.   The projections say crude oil, now about $18 a barrel, willreach $20.37 in 1994 and $30.76 in 2000. Last year's forecastpredicted that $20 a barrel would be reached in 1992, and the pricein 2000 would be $32.87.   These prices are average cost to U.S. refineries of importedsupplies in dollars of 1987 buying power.   Demand for petroleum products, including natural gas liquids,should reach 18.3 million barrels a day in 2000 compared with lastyear's projection of 17.4 million barrels. Demand last year wasabout 16.5 million barrels per day.   Imports, which were 35 percent of consumption last year, shouldbe about 56 percent in 2000, only a slight revision from lastyear's prediction of 55 percent.   In a major revision for natural gas, consumption of 19.7trillion cubic feet per day was predicted for 2000, when theaverage wellhead price is expected to be $4 per thousand cubic feet.   Last year's forecast said the nation would use 18 trillion cubicfeet of gas in 2000 at a price of $5.50.   Consumption last year was about 16.8 trillion cubic feet, andthe current average wellhead price is about $1.75. Usage has neverreached the peaks of the early 1970s, 23 trillion cubic feet, andprobably won't get that high again in this century.   ``This year's view is based on the flexibility gas producershave demonstrated recently in meeting competition, both from othergas suppliers and from suppliers of other fuels,'' the EIA analystswrote. ``Increases (in consumption) after 1995 are likely to beespecially significant as competitive natural gas prices and theincreased use of (gas-burning) combined cycle units by electricutilities push demand for this fuel upward.''   Predicted coal use was reduced slightly, from 1.2 billion tonsin 2000 to 1.1 billion tons. The report noted the entry of newproducing countries in world trade such as China, Venezuela andColombia, which will compete with U.S. exports.   The petroleum demand projection assumes that new cars, currentlyaveraging 27 miles per gallon, will average 34 mpg in the year2000, and that people will use cars and trucks about as much asthey do now. Economic growth, expressed as the average annualchange in the gross national product, was predicted to be 2.3percent per year in the new forecast vs. 2.4 percent last year.   The report also assumes that the overall energy efficiency ofthe economy should improve, though more slowly than in the recentpast. The energy used for a dollar's production of goods andservices, which fell by 2.5 percent per year from 1976 through1986, will fall at 1.0 percent per year, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
