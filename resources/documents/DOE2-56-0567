With transient computer calculationsthese methods, soft shaft drive train and variable speed operation, arecompared with a standard rigid drive train. A short discussion of themost common causes for torque transients in wind power plants with inductiongenerators are also conducted. The torque equations and the computermodel for the variable speed operation are presented. The variable speedcontrol are based on a space vector model. The results from the theoreticalcalculations indicates that there are ways to reduce the severe problemswith torque transients on the drive train with an induction generatorin a wind power plant operation.</TEXT></DOC>
