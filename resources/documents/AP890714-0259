After balking Thursday night at a Senate offer of a comprehensivepackage addressing major differences in House and Senate versions ofthe legislation, the chief House negotiator, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,D-Texas, agreed today to several of its provisions.   Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, reviewed abroad outline of the Senate proposal overnight. Today he said thetwo sides are ``so close on an overwhelming majority'' of issuesthat he will draft a counterproposal on behalf of the House.   ```My intention is to provide a starting point for an overallsettlement,'' he told the five Senate negotiators. ``I believe thisprovides the basis for us to resolve the impasse.''   But Gonzalez and Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the Senate's chiefnegotiator as chairman of its banking committee, acknowledged thatthe two sides remain far apart on one issue: how to finance thebailout.   Nonetheless, both expressed optimism today that enough of anagreement could be reached by the middle of next week to have a billready for President Bush's signature in August.   To minimize the bailout's impact on the federal deficit, theSenate and the White House want to raise the $50 billion immediatelyneeded to close some 500 insolvent Sandamp;Ls and cover the losses oftheir depositors through private 30-year bonds.   Citing potential interest savings totaling $4.5 billion over 30years, the House has demanded that the money be borrowed directlythrough the Treasury, a move that would swell the deficit by a totalof $44 billion in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991.   ``That will remain the key outstanding issue to be debated,''said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the ranking Senate Republican conferee.   In the meantime, Garn agreed to proceed with negotiations todayon how much new capital the government should require Sandamp;L owners toinvest in their businesses as a buffer against future losses offederally insured deposits.   ``We're not very far apart,'' he said.   Gonzalez said he was prepared to accept several provisions in theSenate bill that impose tougher regulatory requirements on some Sandamp;Loperations, and he was willing offer compromises on others.   Earlier, he had described the Senate's offer as ``aggravating''and a ``horrendous injustice'' to a previous agreement to considerhundreds of differences between the two bills item by item.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said that step-by-step approach would``take until Christmas'' to get a bill acceptable to both the Houseand the Senate as well as the administration.   ``It's to the advantage of all concerned to open the deck and putall 52 cards on the table face up,'' Heinz said.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady issued a statement from Parissaying the administration would ``strongly support'' the Senateoffer, but wanted to review its details. Administration officials,meanwhile, worked furiously behind the scenes Thursday night toprevent votes on specific issues.   The dispute brought to the surface major procedural differencesin the way the House and the Senate have addressed the Sandamp;L crisisand the bailout _ the largest in history, with an estimated cost of$1,000 to $1,500 per taxpayer.   Both Gonzalez and Riegle are new to their respective bankingcommittee chairmanships.   Riegle's 21-member Senate committee met behind closed doors lastspring, negotiating compromises on most issues _ including severalprovisions to benefit specific companies _ before voting on it inpublic as a package.   Gonzalez had his 51-member panel put the House version togetherentirely in open sessions.   He called the Senate offer Thursday an attempt to avoid takingstands on specific items in the package that might offend industryand other constituencies.   ``For the first time, there is a spotlight on them, everybody iswatching, and they're not used to that,'' Gonzalez said. ``They'reused to getting behind closed doors and cutting deals, but that'swhere all the mischief has been.''   Among other key elements of the Senate offer are:   _Acceptance of the House's plan to require Sandamp;L owners to risk $3in real, tangible capital for every $100 in lending by Jan. 1, 1995.The Senate bill had provided a laxer standard of $1.50.   _A compromise limiting Sandamp;L ownership of junk bonds to 6 percentof their assets. The House had wanted to require Sandamp;Ls to sell theirjunk bonds within two years, while the Senate bill has a moreliberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets.   _Adoption of a Senate clause guaranteeing Federal Home Loan BankBoard Chairman M. Danny Wall the right to keep his job for the nexttwo years and retain his authority over state-chartered Sandamp;Ls.</TEXT></DOC>
