The National Transportation Safety Board outlined its efforts being taken at the crash scene near Chase, Md., as local emergency officials confirmed that 15 people had died and 176 were injured in the Sunday disaster. Federal investigators said it was too early to determine the cause. &quot;We're not saying anything about the cause right now,&quot; a spokesman for the safety board said.    The safety board has ordered routine toxicological tests on the Conrail and Amtrak crewmen for possible drug or alcohol use; results aren't yet known. In addition, investigators will be taking a close look at the automated train-control systems, which include the track signals, as well as the condition of the track and other equipment.    The crash already has stirred debate on Capitol Hill on a variety of railroad safety issues, some of which have been explored before. Rep. James Florio (D., N.J.), chairman of the Commerce, Transportation and Tourism Subcommittee, predicted the accident &quot;will renew the whole discussion that has periodically arisen as to whether you should have freight trains on the Northeast corridor, which is primarily for high-speed passenger trains.&quot;    At this point, Rep. Florio said, the cause of the accident apppears to be &quot;either a matter of signals not working or being disregarded.&quot;    Federal investigators were vague about the sequence of events that produced the accident, which was the worst in Amtrak's history. &quot;We don't know quite how they hit,&quot; a spokesman for the safety board said. &quot;Both were northbound trains, but we don't know exactly what the trains were doing at the time.&quot;    An Amtrak official said his understanding was that the collision occurred after a string of Conrail engines pulled onto track being used by the Amtrak Colonial, which was traveling faster than 100 miles per hour. The passenger train, en route from Washington to Boston with more than 500 passengers aboard, barreled into the Conrail engines.    The official said that if the track signal was working properly, it should have flashed red. Investigators are probing the possibility of a signal failure. Valuable information could be provided by recorders similar to the &quot;black boxes&quot; that can give important clues in airline disasters. Both trains were equipped with such recorders, but only the Conrail recorder had been retrieved.    Amtrak officials said they expected regular service between Washington and Philadelphia to resume today, though Metroliner service won't be available on that part of the line.    Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), the new chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, said the accident raises funding questions. &quot;As we examine Amtrak funding . . . we'll obviously ask how much is devoted to safety, and whether there has been any skimping.&quot;    But Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) of the Commerce Committee said that with the cause still unclear, it is too early to prescribe policy fixes. &quot;This is a time for careful analysis . . . not for going off half-cocked with all kinds of suggestions that may or may not make sense,&quot; Sen. Danforth said.    Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corp., established in 1970, is subsidized in part by federal funds appropriated annually by Congress and administered through the Transportation Department. </TEXT></DOC>
