Time is offering to purchase the notes at $1,116.50 per $1,000 face amount plus accrued interest. The offer will end next Wednesday.    The publishing and cable television concern said it also filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a total of $500 million of debt securities to be offered periodically. About $250 million of 30-year debentures are expected to be issued in connection with the tender offer and a planned redemption of Eurodollar debt.    Time said the purchase of the notes and the registration statement will reduce the average cost of debt and increase financing flexibility. </TEXT></DOC>
