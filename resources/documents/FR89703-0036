These grantsare for service provision in localities with large refugee populations,high refugee concentrations, and high use of assistance, and where specificneeds exist for supplementation of currently available resources.A notice of proposed qualification of counties and allocation of fundswas published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 25, 1989 (54 FR 3687).As a result of the comments received, major changes have been made in thisfinal notice. These changes are described in detail in the notice. In brief,(1) allocations are made on the basis of a combination of old and new formulas,rather than solely on the basis of a new formula, and (2) no county isphased out of the targeted assistance program under this notice. This approachpermits a more gradual adjustment than was originally proposed. It takesinto account the impact of refugee arrivals in the last few years whileavoiding an abrupt termination of targeted assistance in any currentlyparticipating county.<T3>Application Deadline:</T3> The deadline for applications from Statesfor grants under this notice is August 14, 1989.

The January 25 notice proposed that participation counties be phasedout if they did not meet the original criteria for TAP participation whenapplied to more recent arrival data and that such phased-out counties beprovided with a portion of the allocation they would have received underthe existing formula based on the period between their present project-periodend-dates and September 30, 1989.   This final notice does not require the phaseout of any country, does notuse project-period end-dates in determining allocations, and does not baseany allocations on a period ending September 30, 1989.   2. The January 25 notice proposed that allocations for counties which continuedto meet the original criteria for TAP participation when applied to morerecent arrival data be based entirely on such more recent arrival data,on States' dependency rates, and on their present project-period end-datesprorated through March 31, 1991.   This final notice bases all county allocations on a combination of oldand new formulas, does not take present project-period end-dates into consideration,and does not prorate allocations based on a future end-date.   We believe that these modifications provide a needed adjustment in targetedassistance to take into account the impact of arrivals during 1983-1988and at the same time provide a more gradual move away from allocationsbased on 1980-1982 arrivals than would have been accomplished under theJanuary 25 proposal. If funds are appropriated for targeted assistancefor FY 1990, ORR would expect to propose following this same formula, updatedto include 1989 arrivals.   3. The January 25 notice proposed to exclude certain types of general andremedial educational activities_such as preparation for a high school equivalencydiploma or adult basic education_from being funded under the 85% of targetedassistance allocations that must be directed toward job placement sincesuch educational activities often tend to be long term and not to be directedtoward job placement within a reasonable period, thus not meeting the emphasisof refugee program legislation on early employment.   In this final notice, such activities are allowed if they are providedwithin the context of an individual employability plan for a refugee whichis intended to result in job placement in less than one year.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Purpose and Scope   </ITAG>This notice announces the availability of funds for grants for targetedassistance for services to refugees in counties where, because of factorssuch as unusually large refugee populations, high refugee concentrations,and high use of public assistance, there exists and can be demonstrateda specific need for supplementation of resources for services to this population.  A total of $34,052,000 if FY 1989 funds is available for targeted assistanceunder the FY 1989 appropriations for the Department of Health and HumanServices (Pub.L. 100-436).   The Conference Report on appropriations as follows with respect to thetargeted assistance funds (H. Rept. 100-880, p. 28):<ITAG tagnum="21">The amount agreed to includes $10,531,000 for 12 months of additionalspecial targeted assistance to Dade County schools and Jackson MemorialHospital. For other targeted assistance grantees the conference agreementprovides additional funding at the current rate of operations through fiscalyear 1989.</ITAG>Subsequent to the Conference Report, the amounts appropriated were reduced1.2%.   Of the total funds available, the following amounts have been, or are expectedto be, awarded for special targeted assistance project grants: $10,404,700(the $10,531,000 referred to in the Conference Report minus the 1.2% reduction)for the Dade County Schools and Jackson Memorial Hospital; $400,000 forthe Lowell, MA, school system which has received a recent influx of refugeesand has demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resourcesfor services; and $1,200,000 for Los Angeles County to address a suddenimpact resulting from the arrival of several thousand Armenian refugeesin FY 1988. The remaining targeted assistance funds $22,047,300, are allocatedas set forth in this notice.   Except as specified in this notice, requirements regarding the use of theFY 1989 targeted assistance funds remain unchanged from those applied toFY 1988 targeted assistance funds as set forth in a notice to States ofMarch 4, 1988.           The purpose of targeted assistance grants is to provide, through a processof local planning and implementation, direct services intended to resultin the economic self-sufficiency and reduced welfare dependency of refugeesthrough job placements.The targeted assistance program reflects the requirements of section 412(c)(2)(B)of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the RefugeeAssistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-605), which provides thattargeted assistance grants shall be made available ``(i) primarily forthe purpose of facilitating refugee employment and achievement of self-sufficiency,(ii) in a manner that does not supplant other refugee program funds andthat assures that not less than 95 percent of the amount of the grant awardis made available to the county or other local entity.''Services funded under the targeted assistance allocations are requiredto focus primarily on those refugees who, either because of their considerableand protracted use of public assistance or continued difficulty in securingemployment, constitute a major resettlement problem for the affected jurisdictionwhich cannot be addressed without additional services. In order to ensuresufficient emphasis on services to appropriate clients, each State is requiredto assure that, for each qualified local area, cash assistance recipients(time-eligible and time-expired recipients under any program of the Stateor locality) will make up a percentage of the FY 1989 targeted assistanceclientele which is not less than the State's final FY 1988 dependency rate.Funds awarded under this program are intended to help fulfill the Congressionalintent that ``employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possibleafter their arrival in the United States'' (section 412(a)(1)(B) of theINA). Therefore at last 85% of targeted assistance funds are required tosupport projects which directly enhance refugee employment potential, havespecific employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees toobtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistanceprogram. Innovative approaches to this objective, including strategieswhich address the employment potential of more than one wage earner ina household unit simultaneously are encouraged. General or remedial educationalactivities_such as adult basic education (ABE) or preparation for a highschool equivalency or general education diploma (GED)_may be provided onlywithin the context of an individual employability plan for a refugee whichis intended to result in job placement within less than one year.The degree of success of targeted assistance programs will be measuredin terms on job placements, job retention, and reductions in cash assistance_theprincipal objectives of the authorizing legislation.In order to meet extreme and unusual needs, up to 15% of a local area'sallocation may be used for services which are not directed toward the achievementof a specific employment objective in less than one year but which areessential to the adjustment of refugees in the community, provided suchneeds are clearly demonstrated and such use is approved by the State, orby ORR in the case of State-administered local programs.Cases in which a county plan contains proposed program activities not allowableunder section VII, below, may be entertained by a State only where extremeand unusual need exists and is clearly demonstrated in the county's proposedplan. Such cases will be considered to involve a change in program scopeor objectives and will therefore be subject to ORR prior approval.A State may request a waiver in order to be able to allow a county to usemore than 15% for non-employment-related services. ORR will approve sucha request only in the most extreme circumstances of need.The award of funds to States under this notice will be contingent uponthe completeness of a State's application as described in section IX, below.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments Received</ITAG>One hundred twenty-five letters were received in response to the noticeof proposed availability of funds for refugee targeted assistance. Thecomments are summarized below and are followed in each case by the Department'sresponse.Proposed Formula Allocation<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty-eight commenters expressed support for the proposedallocation formula; 71 opposed it. Most, but not all, of the supportivecomments came from areas which would have received higher allocations asa result of the change. A few comments in support of the proposed formulawere also received from commenters in States whose targeted assistancecounties were proposed to be phased out.The 71 commenters who expressed opposition to the proposed formula citedthe continuing needs of refugees and entrants in their areas and the impactthat a reduction of targeted assistance resources would have on the provisionof services. All of these comments were received from areas proposed tobe phased out or to receive a lower level of funding.Thirteen commenters specifically supported the formula which had been usedto date and which was based on refugee and Cuban/Haitian entrant arrivalsduring FY 1980-1982.<T3>Response: </T3>The Department's proposal of January 25 would have updatedthe existing targeted assistance formula to reflect more recent trendsin refugee resettlement; data on arrivals in 1983-1988 would have beensubstituted for the 1980-1982 arrival data which had been used for allprevious targeted assistance awards. One result of applying the new datato the existing formula would have been to phase out of the targeted assistanceprogram more than half of the currently participating counties by the endof this fiscal year.Our review of the comments has convinced us that, while it is importantto update the targeted assistance allocations in order, to reflect morerecent refugee arrival patterns, it is appropriate to apply the new datain a more gradual manner than we proposed. Therefore this final noticebases the allocations on the entire period of refugee and entrant arrivalsfrom FY 1980 through FY 1988 and does not phase out any currently participatingcounty. This has the effect of continuing to fund services in all targetedassistance sites, yet directing a greater percentage of funds to areaswhich have experienced increases in refugee arrivals over the past sixyears.State Allocation Authority Among Targeted Assistance Counties<T3>Comment: </T3>Twenty comments opposed continuing to allow a State whichhas more than one targeted assistance county the option of determininglocal county allocations within the State; all of these comments came fromone county. One commenter from another State suggested that individualcounty allocations not be specified in the final notice since doing sowould weaken the ability of the State to allocate funds differently ifit deemed this necessary.<T3>Response: </T3>The authority to allow States to allocate funds amongcounties was granted to the States in the FY 1986 program and has beencontinued since. The Department believes that States, as grantees chargedwith overall management of the program, should have the flexibility torespond to varying degrees of need among targeted assistance communitieswithin a particular State.The respective county allocations which the formula yields provide an objectivebasis for awarding funds. However, the specific impacts and relative needsfor funds among the targeted assistance communities within a State mayvary for a variety of local reasons which cannot reasonably be addressedin a formula-based allocation of funds across the country.It should be noted that if a State should propose to allocate funds amongits targeted assistance counties differently from the allocations containedin this announcement, such a proposal continues to be subject to ORR approval.Given this safeguard and, in our view, the lack of any compelling argumentsagainst retaining this provision for State flexibility, we have decidedto retain the provision in this announcement.County Administrative Costs<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether any change was being proposedin the amounts allowable for local administrative costs of targeted assistance.<T3>Response: </T3>No change was proposed in the amounts allowable forlocal targeted assistance administrative costs, previously set forth inthe notice on FY 1986 targeted assistance in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 27, 1986 (51 FR 30552). Allowable localtargeted assistance administrative cost amounts range from 10% to 15% ofthe local allocation amount in inverse relationship to the size of theallocation.Project-Period End-Dates <T3>Comment: </T3>During the comment period, six States submitted end-datesdifferent from those listed in the announcement and requested additionalfunds in instances where they were proposed to be phased out. Two commenterssuggested that such dates not be used as it rewarded those that spent quicklyand penalized those that managed their funds more effectively. Others complainedthat contract periods within the county were performance based and subjectto modification due to performance and thus not reliably reflected in existingproject-period end-dates. <T3>Response: </T3>The use of the project-period end-dates listed in theJanuary 25 proposal was intended to give counties adequate funds to phaseout programs by the end of the fiscal year and to provide a basis for anequitable adjustment of allocations to counties proposed for continuation.The comments led us to conclude that the project-period end-dates, whichhad been established by the States themselves, did not uniformly reflectthe actual dates to which current funds were expected to enable projectsto continue. Therefore we decided not to use such end-dates as an allocationfactor in the formula set forth in this final notice. Program Limitations <T3>Comment: </T3>Twelve comments were received regarding the program servicelimitations. Some of the commenters supported keeping the focus of theprogram on employment of refugees and away from long-term training. Othercommenters felt that long-term training should be allowed and that thetargeted assistance guidelines were inconsistent with welfare reform programswhich permit longer-term training. Objections were either to the one-yearlimit on length of training or to limitations on specific types of trainingwhich would have excluded general English language training, adult basiceducation, and preparation for a high school equivalency diploma. <T3>Response: </T3>The proposed limitations were consistent with earlierannouncements but were more specific in designating particular servicesas unallowable. Targeted assistance guidelines have consistently reflected the emphasisof refugee program legislation on early employment and have prescribedtime-limited service strategies intended to place refugees in jobs as quicklyas possible. Earlier announcements required performance measures of jobplacements and job retention at six months for each service component.A need for more flexibility in service strategies was recognized beginningwith the FY 1984 targeted assistance program when the Department departedfrom strictly employment-related services and allowed 15% of the totalfunds awarded to be used to meet non-employment-related critical unmetneeds. Use of the 15% funding for critical unmet needs continues to beallowed in county plans, subject to State approval and, in the case ofState-administered programs, to ORR approval. In the event that the Statewishes to support a local area's request to allocate more than 15% of itsfunds for non-employment related services, the State must seek formal approvalfrom ORR. As a result of the comments received, the Department has reviewed the proposedwording with respect to the scope of services permissible for support withinthe 85% of funding which must be used for high-priority, employment-relatedservices, and we have modified the announcement to allow certain basiceducational training activities when they can be appropriately providedwithin the context of an individual employability plan for a refugee whichis intended to result in job placement in less than one year. We recognize that long-term education and training may be desirable formany refugees as they progress in building their lives in the United States,but we believe that such long-term activities are beyond the legislatedintent, scope, and funding of the refugee program which provides transitionalhelp aimed at job placement. Updating of Dependency Rates <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters recommended that the formula be updatedby using cash assistance dependency rates as of September 30, 1988, ratherthan a year earlier as in the notice of January 25. <T3>Response: </T3>As indicated in the January 25 notice, final figureswere not then available for the dependency rates as of the end of FY 1988.The later figures are now available and are used in this final notice.Basis and Effect of Proposed Allocation Formula <T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters considered the allocation formula flawedin that it did not contain data on secondary migrants into respective communities.<T3>Response: </T3>Data on secondary migration at the county level arenot collected and therefore are not available for use in formula allocations.<T3>Comment: </T3>A number of commenters complained that the proposed allocationformula would penalize programs that had proved effective because the criteriafor the continued participation of counties included high refugee cashassistance dependency levels and rates. Some suggested that the formulabe modified by conducting, and taking into account the results of, individualcommunity impact assessments or that rewards be provided for effectiveservice strategies. <T3>Response: </T3>We continue to feel that two of the best measures ofimpact are the number and proportion of refugees in a county who are dependenton publicly funded cash assistance. These are the criteria which, togetherwith the number of refugee arrivals in a community and their proportionof the total population of the community, have been used throughout thetargeted assistance program. In fact, targeted assistance providers arerequired to focus services on cash assistance recipients. At the same time, we recognize that a formula based on the available datahas limitations. However, resources are not available to conduct individualcommunity assessments and it is questionable whether such assessments couldprovide an objective basis for providing gradations of limited fundingamong competing communities. We believe that the revised and simplified formula established by thisnotice avoids some of the effects which commenters found objectionablein our January 25 proposal and at the same time recognizes impacts of refugeearrivals which have taken place since 1982. Definition of Targeted Assistance Areas<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters from two targeted assistance sitesrequested that the boundaries of their areas which were defined as targetedbe redrawn so they could continue to qualify. Both of these areas werefound to no longer qualify under the proposed formula.<T3>Response: </T3>Since this final notice does not phase out any targetedassistance areas, we have not modified any of the boundaries.Discretionary Awards<T3>Comment: </T3>A few comments were received on the discretionary grantaward for the Lowell, MA, school system. Most of these comments were fromLos Angeles and pointed to the impact of the arrival of several thousandArmenian refugees in that county over the past year.<T3>Response: </T3>ORR received an unsolicited grant application from LosAngeles County to help address the impact of the Armenian refugees and,as indicated in this notice, has awarded a discretionary grant of $1,200,000for Los Angeles County.Adequacy of Consultation<T3>Comment:</T3> Several comments were received regarding a purportedlack of consultation with the States regarding the proposed formula changes.<T3>Response: </T3>The issuance of our proposed targeted assistance formulaand allocations in January for public comment fulfilled the requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act and provided all interested publicand private agencies, organizations, and individuals with the opportunityto make their views known to us. Before making those proposals, the Officeof Refugee Resettlement in October 1988 held a national conference of StateRefugee Coordinators, representatives of refugees mutual assistance associations(MAAs), representatives of voluntary refugee resettlement agencies, andother interested persons. At that conference, we stated the changes thatwould likely be proposed. During the ensuing discussion, several commentswere made which emphasized the need for adequate phaseout time for thoseareas that would no longer qualify based on a proposed updated formula.These comments were taken into account in developing, and were reflectedin, the proposal which was published in January.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Authorization</ITAG>Targeted assistance projects are funded under the authority of section412(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by theRefugee Assistance Extension Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-605), 8 U.S.C. 1522(c);section 501(a) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Pub. L.96-422), 8 U.S.C. 1522 note, insofar as it incorporates by reference withrespect to Cuban and Haitian entrants the authorities pertaining to assistancefor refugees established by section 412(c)(2) of the INA, as cited above;section 584(c) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and RelatedPrograms Appropriations Act, 1988, as included in the FY 1988 ContinuingResolution (Pub. L. 100-202), insofar as it incorporates by reference withrespect to certain Amerasians from Vietnam the authorities pertaining toassistance for refugees established by section 412(c)(2) of the INA, ascited above, including certain Amerasians from Vietnam who are U.S. citizens,as provided under title II of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing,and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-461).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Eligible Grantees</ITAG>The following requirements, which have previously applied to TAP, continueto apply with respect to FY 1989 awards:Eligible grantees are those agencies of State governments which are responsiblefor the refugee program under 45 CFR 400.5 in States containing countieswhich qualify for FY 1989 targeted assistance awards. The use of targetedassistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limitedto States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian EntrantProgram (CHEP).The State agency will submit a single application on behalf of all countygovernments of the qualified counties in that State. Subsequent to theapproval of the State's application by ORR, local targeted assistance planswill be developed by the county government or other designated entity andsubmitted to the State.A State with more than one qualified county is permitted, but not required,to determine the allocation amount for each qualified county within theState.Applications submitted in response to this notice are not subject to reviewby State and areawide clearinghouses under Executive Order 12372, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Federal Programs.''<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Qualification and Allocation Formula </ITAG>The Director of ORR has decided to apply a new basis for the FY 1989 TAPto determine the allocation of funds. Formula Used to Date The Department has used a two-stage formula for qualification for, andallocation of, TAP funds since the inception of the refugee targeted assistanceprogram in FY 1983. The first stage of the formula defines the qualificationof counties for TAP through the use of four equally-weighted criteria whichwere selected to collectively indicate local conditions and problems whichthe program was intended to address. In order to qualify for TAP funds, a county (or group of adjacent countieswithin the same Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, or SMSA) was requiredto be above the median or above a specified cutoff point of jurisdictionsfor which data were reviewed in three of the four following criteria: (1)The number of refugees placed in the county during FY 1980-1982; (2) theratio of the overall county population to the refugees in item (1), above;(3) the number of refugees in the county who were receiving cash assistanceunder the programs of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) andrefugee cash assistance (RCA) on October 1, 1982; and (4) the ratio ofrefugees in item (3) to the number of refugees in item (1). A county whichplaced above the cutoff point in any three of the above categories wasdetermined to be qualified to apply for targeted assistance funds and wasincluded in the list of qualifying localities for determination of itstargeted assistance allocation. The median for Criterion 1, above, was 2,066.5. The median for Criterion2 was 244.5. The cutoff point for Criterion 3 was 1,000. The cutoff pointfor Criterion 4 was established at 50%, the approximate national averagedependency rate. Counties which met three of the four criteria qualifiedfor the program. The second stage of the formula consisted of the number of refugees ina qualified county who had been in the U.S. 36 months or less and who werereceiving AFDC or RCA on October 1, 1982. Some adjustments were made forState-to-State differences in assistance programs. These adjusted figureson the use of assistance then comprised the formula base for the allocationof funds. (A more detailed description of this formula was pubished inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 3, 1983, 48 FR 24986.) Targeted assistance related to the needs of Cuban and Haitian entrantswas based on county populations of entrants who also arrived during FY1980-1982. (See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 27, 1983, 48 FR 34127.) The results of these formulas provided the basis for the allocation ofTAP funds during each fiscal year in which such funds were appropriated_FY1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988. Revised Formula More than 9 years have passed since the first_and more than 6 years sincethe last_of the arrivals during FY 1980-1982 (October 1, 1979-September30, 1982) on which TAP has been based to date. More than $270,000,000 inTAP funds have been provided to address the needs of those refugees andentrants. The Director has determined that is is no longer appropriate to make TAPfunds available solely on the basis of the needs of refugees and entrantswho arrived during the period October 1, 1979-September 30, 1982. Therefore the Director has decided to base part of the allocation of fundsamong currently participating counties on refugee and entrant placementsin these counties during calendar year (CY) 1983-FY 1988 and on cash assistancedependency rates as of September 30, 1988 (ORR's latest dependency-ratedata). In determining whether additional counties would be eligible to participatein the targeted assistance program, the Director applied the same fourcriteria used previously, including the same cutoff points, to the updatedinformation on refugee arrivals, concentrations, dependency rates, andreceipt of cash assistance. As before, a county would have to meet threeout of the four criteria in order to qualify. The results of these determinations are as follows: 1. <T3>Counties not currently participating in TAP:</T3> No county not currentlyparticipating in TAP was found to meet at least three out of the four criteria.2. <T3>Counties currently participating in TAP:</T3> The allocations amongthe counties currently participating in TAP are based on a combinationof two formulas related to different periods of refugee arrivals. Of the$22,047,300 which is allocated by formula: a. $12,566,961, or 57%, is allocated on the basis of the formula whichhas been used for all previous targeted assistance allocations (``old formula'')and which is based on initial placements during FY 1980-1982 and otherfactors as described above under ``Formula Used to Date.'' b. $9,480,339, or 43%, is allocated on the basis of arrivals during CY1983-FY 1988 (``new formula''). The above percentages are based on the proportion of initial placementsin these counties during the two periods: 340,737, or 57%, during the old-formulaperiod; and 253,552, or 43% during the new-formula period. The old-formula allocation of $12,566,961 follows the same distributionamong counties as in the past. The new-formula allocation of $9,480,339 is based on the number of initialplacements in each county during CY 1983-FY 1988 multiplied by the State'stime-eligible**<NOTE/> dependency rate as of September 30, 1988. The weighted indexresulting from this calculation was used to determine each county's shareof the new-formula funds. We believe that, in the absence of additionaldata, each county's proportionate share of the number of initial placementsand the State's time-eligible dependency rate provide good indicators ofrelative need.***<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>** The term ``time-eligible'' means refugees in their first24 months in the U.S., the time-period for which States could claim cashand medical assistance costs against ORR's grants to the States as of theend of FY 1988. ``Time-expired'' refers to refugees who have been in theU.S. more than 24 months. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>*** More specific data might include the estimated countypopulations of refugees who arrived during CY 1983-FY 1988 and actual numbersof time-expired refugees who are receiving cash assistance. However, itis not possible to estimate county refugee populations reliably becauseof lack of county-level information on secondary migration. Data are notuniversally available on the receipt of cash assistance by time-exportedrefugees. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Allocations</ITAG>Table 1 lists the participating counties, the amount of each county's allocationwhich is based on the old formula, the number of placements in each countyduring CY 1983-FY 1988, the State's dependency rate as of September 30,1988, the amount of each county's allocation which is based on the newformula, and the county's total allocation. Although Table 1 shows an amount for each county, the Director has decided,in the case of a State which contains more than one qualified county, tocontinue to permit the State to determine (in accordance with the requirementsset forth in this notice) the appropriate allocation of the State's targetedassistance award among the qualified counties in the State. The Directorsees this as continuing ORR's practice of providing as much authority andflexibility as possible to States in determining the relative needs ofthe qualified counties within a State. Thus each such State, as in theFY 1988 TAP, is responsible for determining an appropriate and equitablebasis for allocating the funds among the qualified counties in the Stateand for including in its application for approval by ORR a descriptionof this allocation basis, the data to be used, and the allocation proposedfor each county. Table 2 provides State totals for the county allocations set forth in Table1. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2(4,0,4),i1,s25,6,9,8,12,12,12</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Targeted Assistance Allocations by

Allowable Activities and Client Prioritization</ITAG>At least 85% of a county's FY 1989 targeted assistance funds must be usedto support activities permissible under section 412(c) of the INA whichhave specific employment objectives and are directly related to aidingrefugees in finding and retaining jobs within less than one year's participationin the targeted assistance program. Examples of these activities are: Jobdevelopment; job placement; job-related and vocational English; short-termjob training specifically related to opportunities in the local economy;on-the-job training; business and employer incentives (such as on-siteemployee orientation, vocational English training, or bilingual supervisorassistance); and business technical assistance. These funds may be usedfor general or remedial educational services_such as adult basic education(ABE) or preparation for a high school equivalency or general educationdiploma (GED)_only if such service is provided within the context of anindividual employability plan for a refugee which is intended to resultin job placement within less than one year. Strategies which address the employment potential of more than one wageearner in a household unit simultaneously are encouraged. Up to 15% of a local area's allocation may be used for other services whichare permissible under section 412(c) of the INA and which are identifiedand demonstrated in the county plan to be essential services in addressingextreme and unusual needs of the refugee population in the targeted assistancearea even though they do not have specific objectives of job placementwithin less than one year. Subject to State review and approval, a maximumof 15% of the allocation amount for each area may be used in funding theseservices. In the event that a State might wish to grant a local area's request toallocate more than 15% of its funds for such non-employment-related services,the State is required to obtain formal prior approval by the Director ofORR. Only the most extreme needs will be considered adequate justificationfor a local area to use more than 15% of its TAP funds for these services.In order to justify the provision of services for extreme and unusual needs,a county plan must identify the target population, demonstrate clearlythe nature and extent of the needs, and describe how the use of more than15% of its targeted assistance funds to address such needs would contributeto the adjustment of the refugee population. Services funded under TAP are required to focus primarily on those refugeeswho, either because of their considerable and protracted use of publicassistance or continued difficulty in securing employment, constitute amajor resettlement problem for the affected jurisdiction which cannot beaddressed without additional services. In order to ensure sufficient emphasison services to appropriate clients, each State is required to provide anassurance in its application to ORR that, for each qualified local area,cash assistance recipients (time-eligible and time-expired recipients underany program of the State or locality) will make up a percentage of theFY 1989 targeted assistance clientele which is not less than the State'sfinal FY 1988 dependency rate as determined by ORR. This client prioritization requirement does not apply to the 15% fundsdescribed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Application and Implementation Process</ITAG>Under the FY 1989 targeted assistance program, as in FY 1988, States mayapply for and receive grant awards on behalf of qualified counties in theState. A single allocation will be made to each State by ORR on the basisof an approved State application. The State agency will, in turn, receive,review, and determine the acceptability of individual county targeted assistanceplans. Although funding for educational services in Dade County, FL, and Lowell,MA, for medical services at Jackson Memorial Hospital, and to address specialimpacts in Los Angeles County is part of the appropriation amount for targetedassistance, the scope of activities for these special projects will beadministratively determined. Applications for those funds are thereforenot subject to provisions contained in this notice to other requirementswhich have been conveyed separately.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Application Requirements </ITAG>The State application requirements for grants for the FY 1989 targetedassistance program are as follows: States that are currently operating under approved management plans fortheir FY 1988 targeted assistance program and wish to continue to do sofor their FY 1989 grants may provide the following in lieu of resubmittingthe full currently approved plan: The State's application shall provide: A. Assurance that the State's current management plan for the administrationof the targeted assistance program, as approved by ORR, will continue tobe in full force and effect for the FY 1989 targeted assistance program,subject to any additional assurance or revisions required by this noticewhich are not reflected in the current plan. Any proposed modificationsto the approved plan will be described separately in the application andare subject to ORR review and approval. B. Timetables for awarding funds to the local areas consistent with theconclusion of services under the FY 1988 program as modified by carry-forwardrequests or no-cost extensions of FY 1984-1988 targeted assistance funds.Service period can be for up to 18 months but must conclude by no laterthan March 31, 1991. C. A line item budget and justification for State administrative costslimited to a maximum of 5% of the total award to the State. D. Revised information and description of any proposed plan modifications.Any proposed changes must address and reference all appropriate portionsof the FY 1988 application content requirements to ensure complete incorporationin the State's management plan. E. <T3>This paragraph applies only to States administering the program locally:</T3>States that have administered the program locally or provide directservice to the refuge population (with the concurrence of the county) mustsubmit a program summary to ORR for prior review and approval. The summarymust include a description of the proposed services; a justification forthe projected allocation for each component including relationship of fundsallocated to numbers of clients served, characteristics of clients, durationof training and services, projected outcomes, and cost per placement. Inaddition, the program component summary should describe any ancillary servicesor subcomponents such as day care, transportation, or language training.F. <T3>This paragraph applies only to States with two or more counties receivingtargeted assistance funds: </T3>As in FY 1988, a State with two or morelocal areas which qualify for the program may choose to determine respectivecounty allocations. If the State chooses to determine county allocationsdifferently from those set forth in Table 1 of this notice, the State shouldprovide a description of the State's proposed allocation plan. The allocationapproach should be based upon existing FY 1988 funds, FY 1984-1986 fundscarried forward, and indicators of refugee need for targeted assistanceservices. The application should contain a description of the allocationapproach, data used in its determination, and the calculated allocationamount for each county. States are encouraged to revise allocation formulasto assure appropriate funding among eligible counties for the durationof the grant such that targeted assistance activities within the Stateconclude simultaneously. The allocation formula is subject to ORR approval.If the State chooses not to determine county allocation amounts, the Statemust provide the allocations which are specified in this notice. G. Assurance that, for each qualified local area, cash assistance recipients(time-eligible or time-expired recipients under any program of the Stateor locality) will make up a percentage of the FY 1989 targeted assistanceclientele no less than the State's final FY 1988 dependency rate, as determinedby ORR, unless a waiver of this requirement is granted by ORR.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Review, Technical Assistance, and Award Procedure </ITAG>Applications will be reviewed on a non-competitive basis to determine acceptability.Such determination will be based on the completeness of the submission,satisfactory progress by the grantee, the receipt of required program andfinancial reports, and ORR's determination that continued funding is inthe best interest of the Government. The Department will provide technicalassistance to the applicant if it is necessary in order to develop a proposalwhich warrants the award of funds at the proposed allocation amount andif such assistance is requested by the applying State agency. Final determinationas to the acceptability of applications is at the discretion of the Directorof ORR.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Reporting Requirements </ITAG>FY 1989 TAP grants must be tracked separately from previous TAP grants,both financially and programmatically. For the FY 1989 program, Statesare required to submit semiannual reports and one final report as in previousyears on the services provided in each targeted area. States are requiredto report on the number of job placements and retentions, cash assistancerecipients placed on jobs, costs per placement, and other items specifiedin the ``Reporting Requirements for Targeted Assistance Grants for Servicesfor Refugees in Local Areas of High Need,'' OMB No. 0970-0042, expirationdate February 28, 1991. Semiannual reports covering activity through September30 and March 31 of each year are due on November 30 and May 31 of eachyear. A final cumulative report is due 120 days after the end of the fullgrant period.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Philip A.
