Generallyknown as the American burying beetle, this species has also been referredto as the giant carrion beetle (Wells et al. 1983). The American buryingbeetle is the largest member of its genus in North America, measuring 25-36mm (1.0-1.4 inches) in length. Distinguishable by its large size, the Americanburying beetle is also identifiable by a large orange-red pronotal disk.This, the orange antennal club, red frons, and two pairs of scalloped redspots on the elytra (wing covers) contrast sharply with a black background(Wells et al. 1983). Investigations to date indicate that the biology of the American buryingbeetle is similar to that of other species of the genus, except that thecarrion selected for breeding purposes tends to be larger (Kozol et al.1987). Schweitzer and Master (1987) based the following description ofthe American burying beetle's life history on Kozol's paper and their ownobservations:<ITAG tagnum="21">Beetles of both sexes are attracted to appropriate carrion at night,generally soon after dark. Apparently males and females fight among themselvesuntil one pair (usually the largest male and female) remains on the carcass.These individuals then bury it, often before dawn of the first morning.The carrion may then be moved laterally for some distance (often over ameter) underground. Eventually, a chamber is constructed. Eggs are laidon the carrion and at least one, usually both, parents remain with theeggs and subsequent larvae. Larvae cannot survive without parental care.They emerge as adults in about 48-56 days and the parents and young thendisperse. Occasionally, individuals may succeed in rearing two broods ofyoung. As far as is known, the young, which emerge in July and August,do not reproduce until the following June or July. Adults overwinter, probablysingly in the soil. Adults feed on carrion and apparently also captureand consume live insects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Apparently, any kind of vertebrate carrion between about 50 and 200grams is acceptable * * *. Brood sizes varied between 8 and 23 teneraladults eclosed.</ITAG>Once widely distributed throughout eastern North America, this specieshas disappeared from most of its historic range. Historical records include32 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 Canadian provinces encompassingthe area from Nova Scotia and Quebec, south to Florida and west to Minnesota,South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas (Wells et al. 1983, Schweitzerand Master 1987). Two extant populations are known, one on a New Englandisland and the other in eastern Oklahoma. The New England island population was estimated at 520 beetles (850 beetlesat the high end of the 95% confidence interval) in 1986 (Kozol et al. 1987).All but one capture occurred on a portion of the island where much of theland is owned by a State agency or by private conservation organizations.The existence of the eastern Oklahoma population was recently brought tothe attention of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). This populationis known from collections at blacklight of one specimen in 1979, one specimenof unknown date sometime between 1979 and 1987, seven specimens in 1987,and one specimen in 1988. Several circumstances, including the sporadicpattern of these collections at a blacklight that has reportedly been operatedfor more than 5000 hours since 1976 and the fact that at least five otherspecies of <T3>Nicrophorus </T3>are regularly collected at this site, suggest thatthe size and stability of this population may be a matter of concern (pers.comm. Pat Mehlhop, Oklahoma Natural Heritage Inventory, 1988). In the early 1980's, an incident involving collection of a single Americanburying beetle occurred about 40 miles north of the site of the Oklahomapopulation described above. Nightly blacklighting conducted during oneweek each summer over an eight year period yielded only the one specimenat this locale (pers. comm. D. Davis, Smithsonian Institution, 1988). Itis unclear whether there is a relationship between this specimen and theother Oklahoma collections. A single specimen was captured and released at a second site in New Englandin 1985. Extensive efforts using both carrion baits and blacklights resultedin the capture of over 7000 <T3>Nicrophorus </T3>species at this location in 1986, but failed to retrapthis species (Schweitzer and Master 1987). Anderson (1982) speculated that the natural habitat of the species is matureclimax forest, but the fact that there is no forest on the island wherethe beetle is found today casts serious doubt on this thesis. Habitat occupiedby the known population includes maritime shrub thickets, coastal morainegrassland, and pastureland. There is agreement that availability of significanthumus and top soil suitable for burying of carrion is an essential habitatrequirement of the American burying beetle (Schweitzer and Master 1987).Davis (1980) detailed the decline in the number of American burying beetlespecimens in collections and solicited information on the locations ofexisting populations. Anderson (1982) found a pattern of increasing localizationin capture records. The <T3>IUCN Red Data Book </T3>(Wells <T3>et al. </T3>1983) described this species as having experienced ``oneof the most disastrous declines of an insect's range ever to be recorded,''and stated that the Service should be encouraged to list it as an endangeredspecies. In 1980, the Service included <T3>Nicrophorus americanus </T3>in a status review of insects in majorpublic collections (Perkins 1980). The American burying beetle was recognizedas a Category 2 candidate for listing in the Service's May 22, 1984 (49FR 21670) invertebrate review notice. Category 2 taxa are those for whichexisting information indicates the possible appropriateness of proposinglisting under the Endangered Species Act (Act), but for which sufficientbiological information is not presently available to support a proposedrule. In 1987, the Eastern Regional Office of The Nature Conservancy compiledthe results of a range-wide status survey for the American burying beetle.Since 1960, this once ubiquitous species has been collected only in Ontario,Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Nebraska (pers. comm. Brett Ratcliffe,Nebraska State Museum, 1988) and in two New England states. Moreover, failureof extensive efforts in 1986 to recapture American burying beetles at thesites of most recent captures in Arkansas and Michigan suggests a continuingconstriction of the species' range. Significant efforts in 1986 and 1987to locate American burying beetles on another New England island, wherea 1985 capture was reported, were unsuccessful. Other recent unsuccessfulcapture efforts were conducted in northwestern Pennsylvania, New Jersey,New York (Long Island), Tennessee, western North Carolina, Torreya StatePark in Florida, and on mainland areas in New England. The abundance ofthe species in collections (including student collections) with capturedates prior to 1950 and the ease of capture at blacklight and pitfall trapsexperienced at the site of the known extant island population confirm thatthese unsuccessful efforts to locate American burying beetles are indicativeof their decline throughout most of their former range. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the October 11, 1988 proposed rule, all interested parties were requestedto submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the developmentof a final rule. Copies of the proposed rule were mailed to appropriateState resource agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientificorganizations, and other interested parties, with a request for comments.Notices inviting public comment were published in newspapers of generalcirculation in all areas where American burying beetles have been capturedduring the last ten years and in several other areas with less recent capturerecords. Ten written comments were received; all supported the proposedrule. No new information was received. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the American buryingbeetle (<T3>Nicrophorus americanus</T3>) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification or Curtailment ofits Habitat or Range As described above, the American burying beetle has almost entirely vanishedfrom its former range. It is possible that future search efforts may resultin discovery of another extant population. However, the extent of the species'decline suggests that any newly discovered populations are also vulnerableto whatever factors have caused their disappearance elsewhere.Anderson (1982) believed that, as with a similarly large European <T3>Nicrophorus </T3>species, the decline of the American burying beetlewas due to the destruction of ``primary'' or virgin forest, which he speculatedwas the essential habitat of the species. This hypothesis is refuted bythe fact that many records document collections of the species in variouslocations more than a century after destruction of the primary forest.Furthermore, the site of the known New England population supports no forests.It is possible that loss of some obscure habitat component has contributedto the beetle's disappearance, but habitat generally similar to that ofthe known population is not rare (Schweitzer and Master 1987). B. Over-Utilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes Collection has not been a factor in the present decline of this once ubiquitousspecies (Schweitzer and Master 1987). However, ease of trapping could makeremaining populations vulnerable to over-collection if their locationswere to become well known. C. Disease or Predation Predation has probably not been a factor in this species' decline, butintroduction of a non-native, species-specific pathogen could explain thefact that this species has disappeared while several other species of thesame genus (for example, <T3>N. orbicollis </T3>and <T3>N. tomentosus</T3>) with similar habits continue to thrive (pers. comm.Andrea Kozol, Boston University, 1988). Such a hypothesis is also consistentwith the location of the two remaining populations: one on an island andthe other on the edge of the species' historic range. No studies addressingthis theory have been undertaken to date. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms This species has no legal protection in any State where it is known orsuspected to exist. Localized regulations requiring that electronic bug-zappersin the vicinity of the known population be equipped with grids small enoughto exclude American burying beetles would remove the potential for takedescribed under E, below. Lack of understanding of the causes of the species'decline precludes recommendation of other regulations for protection ofthe species at this time. It is possible that future studies of the specieswill show a need for such regulations. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued ExistenceA low reproductive rate (compared with other insects) limits the abilityof this species to rebound from any period of elevated mortality. Use of electronic bug-zappers in the vicinity of American burying beetlescould result in take of this species. Other <T3>Nicrophorus </T3>species have been killed by zappers and American buryingbeetles are attracted to identical light sources (pers. comm. MichelleP. Scott, Boston University, 1987). Since <T3>Nicrophorus </T3>males are involved in brood-rearing, this sex (whichis selectively killed by zappers in most insect groups) is not functionallysurplus. Some speculation has focused on the possible role of the pesticide DDTin the decline of the American burying beetle. Some support for this hypothesisis furnished by reports that the site of the known island population, unlikemost other New England islands and many mainland areas, was never extensivelysprayed for mosquito or gypsy moth suppression. However, most other recentrecords of the species are from farming areas where DDT would likely havebeen used prior to its banning. Further, if DDT contamination of the beetle'sfood supply had occurred, it is hard to explain why other carrion-feedingmembers of the genus were not similarly affected (Schweitzer and Master1987). The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the American burying beetle as endangered.Endangered status is warranted by the decline in the species' range frommore than a third of the continental United States and parts of southeasternCanada to only two verified populations. Failure of 1986 efforts to relocatethe species in Arkansas and Michigan suggests that whatever caused thedecline of the species was still at work at least as recently as the mid1970's. While it is not improbable that other remnant populations willbe discovered in the future, it is likely that those populations remainvulnerable to the factors that have caused the general decline of the species.Further, there is no known way to reverse any decline that might occurin the known populations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for this species at this time. This determinationis based on the premise that such a designation would not be beneficialto the species (50 CFR 424.12). As discussed under ``Factor B'' above,ease of trapping could make the American burying beetle vulnerable to collectorswho might be attracted to the locale of the known populations by the publicationof maps and other specific location information. No benefit from criticalhabitat designation has been identified that outweighs the threat of collection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and local governments and private agencies, groups andindividuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperationwith the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for alllisted species. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing.The protection required of Federal agencies and prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. The Act requires development and implementation of recovery plans for listedspecies. Because the causes of the decline of the American burying beetleare unknown, it is probable that initial recovery activities will focuson research to determine those causes. Later actions may include effortsto reestablish the species in suitable locations in its former range. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is listed as endangeredor threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is designated.Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of theAct are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Service has notidentified any ongoing or proposed projects with Federal involvement thatcould affect this species. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell oroffer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. Italso is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship anysuch wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply toagents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered or threatened wildlife species under certain circumstances.Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permitsare available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survivalof the species, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwiselawful activities. Requests for copies of the regulations on take of endangered and threatenedspecies and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the Office ofManagement Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Washington.DC, 20036 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
