The final vote was 93-5. Ratification requires the approval oftwo-thirds of the members present and voting.   Approval of the treaty came in time for it to be presented toPresident Reagan at his summit meeting with Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev, which begins Sunday in Moscow.   It also gave cause for optimism to those who see the relativelymodest INF accord as paving the way for a more ambitious treatymaking deep cuts in the two sides' arsenals of long-range nuclearmissiles.   ``We are making a breakthrough,'' said Senate Majority Whip AlanCranston, D-Calif. ``It is not a substantively significanttreaty.... But it lays the foundation'' for future treaties ``thatcan substantially reduce the scale, cost and dangers of this armsrace.''   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helmsof North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat Ernest Hollingsof South Carolina.   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did not vote.   The pact was the first U.S.-Soviet weapons treaty to be approvedsince the 1972 accord on Anti-Ballistic Missiles.   White House officials in Washington issued a statement from thepresident following the vote, in which Reagan said: ``I am verypleased with the action of the United States Senate in consentingto ratification of the INF treaty. In two days I will arrive in theSoviet Union to meet with General Secretary Gorbachev to discussour four-part agenda. Today's action by the Senate clearly showssupport for our arms reduction objectives.''   As it moved toward approval, the Senate adopted strong languagegoverning future interpretations of the medium-range missiletreaty, and turned aside a series of Republican amendments thatwould have undermined that provision.   ``I think we've closed all the loopholes we know about in thistreaty, and it's a much better treaty than when it was sent'' toCongress, said Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   Thursday's session had ended on a testy partisan note, with Byrdthreatening to let the treaty languish if Republicans continued toseek what he saw as debilitating amendments.   Approval of the treaty was considered certain because itrequires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, or 67 votes, and as manyas 90 senators have expressed support for it. But the possibilityof delay remained alive.   Byrd warned GOP senators that they risked embarrassing their ownpresident by failing to deliver the approved treaty in time for theSunday start of the summit.   ``This is no empty threat,'' Byrd admonished senators. ``Ifwe're going to continue to have Mickey Mouse amendments like this,the president is not going to have his treaty before he leaves thesummit.''   Byrd and GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., informed Reagan of thedecision during a telephone call to Helsinki moments after thevote. The two leaders accepted Reagan's invitation to come toMoscow next Tuesday and bring the ratification documents with them.   One amendment, an attempt by Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., tomake any Soviet violation grounds for U.S. withdrawal from thetreaty, was defeated on a vote of 66-30. And a move by Sen. LarryPressler, R-S.D., to require Reagan to certify at the summitwhether the Soviets are living up to their human rightsobligations, also was defeated, 86-10.   On Thursday, Byrd had won overwhelming bipartisan passage of anamendment stipulating that the White House will be bound in thefuture by the interpretation of the treaty as expressed byadministration officials during congressional hearings.   Any effort to change that interpretation would have to beapproved again by the Senate before becoming valid, said theamendment, which passed on a vote of 72-27.   ``The Senate has clearly made visible that it is an equalpartner with any president in the making of treaties,'' Byrd saidafter the provision was adopted, ``and I hope that will be asobering impact on this president and on Mr. Gorbachev when theysit down and discuss another agreement'' on limiting long-rangenuclear weapons.   The provision grew out of a dispute with the Reaganadministration over White House efforts to redefine the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Soviets to allow greaterlatitude for testing of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense program.   But a few hours after the vote on the Byrd amendment, Sen. PeteWilson, R-Calif., came close to undermining the provision byproposing a change stipulating that the United States could not bebound by any interpretation of the treaty ``that is not equallybinding on the Soviet Union.''   Wilson's proposal was killed, 53-45, and an angry Byrd sent theSenate home for the night. The vote was virtually a party-linedivision.   Two similar attempts by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., were defeatedtoday by wider margins.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by Reaganand Gorbachev in Washington on Dec. 8, requires the eliminationwithin three years of all nuclear missiles with a range of 300miles to 3,400 miles, and would result in the destruction of 867U.S. missiles in Europe and 1,752 Soviet missiles.   While those numbers represent a relatively small slice of eachside's total nuclear arsenal, the pact is regarded as particularlyimportant because it breaks a long drought in arms-controlagreements between the two sides and sets the stage for progress ona much larger goal: massive cuts in each side's long-range nuclearmissile fleet.   It was also important because it would be the first treaty toactually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simplyslowing growth in their numbers. And its far-reaching verificationprovisions include the first on-site inspections allowed by eithersuperpower.</TEXT></DOC>
