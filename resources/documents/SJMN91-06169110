His May 21 assassination by asuicide bomber came after his rural constituency of Amethi in northern Indiahad already voted. A by-election will be held later to fill the seat.;   Nearly a month after his death, party leaders were still wrangling over asuccessor even as they prepared to take the reins of government.;    &quot;Sure, weare going to form the government,&quot; said Congress Party General SecretaryBalram Jakhar. He said the party was ready to seek a coalition with almost anyparty except its strongest challenger, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya JanataParty.;    The Bharatiya Janata, which campaigned on a platform of Hindunationalism, was improving on its performance in previous elections and lookedset to become the main opposition group. But it was routed by Congress in onestate it had swept in the 1989 elections and sank dramatically in a second.;   A top Bharatiya Janata leader, Atal Behari Vaypayee, said his party wouldplay the role of &quot;an effective opposition&quot; in parliament, Press Trust of Indiareported.;    The Janata Dal party of V.P. Singh, who succeeded Gandhi asprime minister in 1989, was the big loser. Singh won in his own constituency,but his party's already-diminished power base was reduced to little more thantwo of India's 25 states.;    With nearly two-thirds of the races declared,there were only two seats for the splinter party of Chandra Shekhar, whoreplaced Singh last November.;    Chandra Shekhar, leader of the SocialistJanata Dal, met with President Ramaswamy Venkataraman and asked to be relievedof the prime ministership as soon as possible, Press Trust said.;    With 320of the 511 Parliament seats declared, the Congress Party had won 168, theBharatiya Janata 73 and the Janata Dal 24, state-run television reported. Therest went to smaller parties, including 12 to regional parties allied with theCongress.;    Election analyst Prannoy Roy said in a television commentarythat the results, coupled with trends in undeclared races, indicated theCongress Party would end up with 210 to 220 seats.;    Turnout was 53 percent,the lowest in any of India's nine previous parliamentary elections, accordingto preliminary figures.;    After Gandhi's assassination, the Congress Partywas cast into disarray when his Italian-born widow, Sonia, declined to assumeher husband's role as party president and the post went to former ForeignMinister P.V. Narasimha Rao.;    Rao, 69, was a compromise candidate whoseselection avoided a potentially divisive power struggle. But Rao, anuninspired campaigner with no personal power base, was not even a candidate inthe parliamentary elections.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New Delhi, India  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910617  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  569  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 17, 199100169110,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
