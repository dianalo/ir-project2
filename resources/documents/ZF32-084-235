 Alliances such as the ACEinitiative and the recent collaboration of IBM and Apple are indications ofthe changes taking place.andP;  Microsoft and IBM get divorced; DEC collaborateswith SGI and Compaq; Motorola licenses IBMs RISC architecture; IBM preparesto push RISC systems in commercial applications.andP;  These developments haveenormous potential impacts on the success of various microprocessors.andO;Looking beyond the details of the alliances, what is really going on?andM;In the past decade, the desktop computer industry has grown up.andP;  Ten yearsago, personal computers were fancy toys that were useful in some limitedsmall business applications, and workstations were exotic systems sold invery small numbers to engineers and scientists.andP;  Now, however, the picturehas changed radically.andP;  Personal computers and workstations have largelyconverged from a hardware perspective, but they remain entirely separate interms of how they are configured, sold, and supported, and in the system andapplication software they run.andP;  Personal computers have become indispensabletools for companies of all sizes, and workstations have become relativelyaffordable.andP;  Networks of PCs and/or workstations are replacing mainframe andminicomputer applications at a rapid pace, a trend called &quot;downsizing.&quot;andO;Networks of desktop computers and servers threaten mainframes withextinction, and high-end workstations and multiprocessor servers are makingtraditional supercomputers an endangered species.andM;Yet with all this change, the vast majority of computers are still based onaging standards using microprocessors and system software from a fewsuppliers in near-monopoly positions.andP;  The enormous profits reaped bycompanies such as Intel and Microsoft, combined with major transitions intechnology, creates an inherently unstable situation.andP;  RISC microprocessorsuppliers, in collaboration with the workstation companies, want to unseatIntel's x86 as the microprocessor architecture of choice.andP;  IBM wants morecontrol over its system components, both the microprocessors and the systemsoftware.andP;  Apple wants to gain some leverage from its outstandingapplications software base and play a larger role in the industry.andM;Unix has been touted for years as the operating system that will soon takeover desktop computers.andP;  It hasn't happened yet, and it isn't likely tohappen ever.andP;  Unix isn't the right solution; it's just the best thing thathappened to be sitting around.andP;  It wasn't designed for workstations orgraphical user interfaces, and adapting it to this new environment bas onlyworsened the fragmentation that has always been, and always will be, ahallmark of the Unix world.andM;The NT (new technology) version of OS/2, also referred to as OS/2 3.0 (andapparently essentially the same thing as Windows/NT), is one attempt toestablish a new operating system that provides a modern foundation for newapplications while providing compatibility with existing standards.andP;  Theproposed IBM/Apple joint venture bas a similar goal.andM;The news has been dominated by deal-making and posturing, but most of thedevelopment work remains to be done.andP;  The critical products, including OS/23.0 and the new Apple/IBM system software, have not yet come to fruition.andP;  Onthe hardware side, it isn't yet clear how the performance of next-generationRISC processors will compare to Intel's 586, but it seems unlikely that RISCprocessors will outperform Intel's offerings by a sufficient margin to swaythe general-purpose PC market.andP;  As incumbents, Intel and Microsoft havepowerful advantages, but they are under attack from all directions.andM;Over the coming decade, new hardware and software standards will replacethose we are using today.andP;  Each company wants its approach to be the newstandard, and this is the fundamental cause of the current confusion.andP;  Theoutcome is dependent on much work that is yet to be completed, and thestandards that dominate in the future will be determined, in large part, onhow well each company executes its plans.andM;MIPS-based ACE systems and SPARCstations seem to have little chance ofexpanding very far beyond traditional workstation markets, and Unix justdoesn't seem like the right basis for the next generation of PCs.andP;  The besthope for a new, modern operating system to form the foundation for the nextgeneration of computers is the Apple/IBM alliance, but this effort couldeasily be hobbled by the difficulties of melding two development teams fromtwo very different corporate cultures with different products in mind.andM;Every player seems to have potentially crippling weaknesses, makingMicrosoft-with the inertia of the installed base on its side-the most likelywinner.andP;  The situation is sufficiently unstable, however, that a single majorblunder-or a brilliant success-by any player could dramatically change theoutcome.andP;  It is going to be a fascinating decade.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
