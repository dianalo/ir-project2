It was not immediately known whether anyone was injured.   Opposition leaders canceled the rally after the government put upbarricades throughout the capital and sent large numbers of troopsinto the streets with harsh new martial law powers, sources said.   Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi had said she would leadthousands in a rally to mark Martyrs Day, which commemorates the1947 assassination of her father and other independence leaders.   She said in a telephone interview from Bangkok that she canceledit to avoid bloodshed.   The soldiers ``blocked off all the roads and prepared literally akilling field for the people,'' said Ms. Suu Kyi, general secretaryof the National League for Democracy.   Word of the cancelation apparently did not reach students whomarched toward the Martyrs Mausoleum carrying wreaths they intendedto lay there.   Ms. Suu Kyi said soldiers used sticks to beat some of about 3,000students in the capital's Swegondine district.   A Western diplomat said he saw an army patrol scatter two groupsof students, one of several hundred and another of more than 1,000,near the Shwedagon Pagoda, the city's Buddhist temple.   ``About 25 to 30 soldiers advanced in line across the road, somehad bayonets leveled at the crowd ... others had grenadelaunchers,'' he said by telephone.   Soldiers pursued students down a side street, dragged some ofthem out and hit them a few times with batons, he said.   ``I saw about 15 or 20 picked up and put in a truck,'' he said.   The others fled, littering the streets with wreaths, he said.   There also were reports of clashes between soldiers and studentsnear the School of Fine Arts in the Bahan district, about half amile from the mausoleum.   A heavily-guarded ceremony sponsored by the government was heldat the mausoleum in the morning, although it was boycotted by mostopposition parties.   Downtown streets were largely empty in the afternoon as manypeople stayed indoors, apparently fearing a clash between theopposition and the military.   Troops toting automatic rifles patrolled most intersections,where there was little traffic and people ran to hide when militaryvehicles passed.   All day, the state radio repeated new regulations issued Tuesdaythat include death penalties for those violating martial law.Unauthorized gatherings of more than five people have been bannedunder martial law.   Martyrs Day, a public holiday, commemorates Burmese leaders whowere assassinated the year before Burma gained independence fromBritain. Most prominent of the martyrs was Suu Kyi's father, AungSan.   Ms. Suu Kyi said: ``Martial law is in full swing now. It is whatthey have always wanted.   ``They knew perfectly well that people wanted this to be aperfectly peaceful ceremony, but they have used this day as anexcuse to impose martial law,'' she said. ``Their rule is based onintimidation _ they don't have any other way of running thecountry.''   Ms. Suu Kyi is the most strident critic of military rule sinceshe emerged at the head of last year's uprising for democracy.   The army killed thousands of unarmed demonstrators over severalmonths before army commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power, killinghundreds more demonstrators to re-establish control in September.   The pace of dissent has quickened in the past month, with Ms. SuuKyi drawing large crowds to her rallies.</TEXT></DOC>
