In a speech centered on campaign finance proposals to ``trulyclean up the system,'' Bush also proposed new restrictions onpolitical action committees and curtailing some advantages enjoyedby incumbent members of Congress.   Regarding a pay raise, which members rejected earlier this yearamid public outrage, Bush said, ``I will also work with Congress onthe development of details for increasing the pay of those inCongress as well as other senior employees of the executive branch.''   He said he would also send Congress separate legislation to banhonoraria members earn for outside speaking engagements and ``toaddress certain aspects of compenstation for federal officials,''including a 25 percent pay increase for judges that he endorsedpreviously.   Campaign finance reform was the focus of Bush's speech before agroup of congressional interns.   The president said his proposals were designed to loosen ``thegrip of special interests'' in politics and strengthen the role ofthe political parties, which he called ``the indispensableorganizers of democracy.''   Several of his proposals would have the effect of harmingDemocrats the most since they hold the majority in Congress andcontrol most statehouses, which have the power to draw politicaldistrict lines.   Bush's proposals would:   _Abolish political action committees that are connected tocorporations, unions or trade groups, while allowing so-calledideological PACs that operate independently of any such organization.   _Reduce the per-candidate contribution limit for the remainingPACs from the current $5,000 to $2,500.   _More than double the amount of money political parties areallowed to give to each congressional candidate. For Senate races,the amount currently ranges from $92,000 to about $1.5 million,depending on state population.   _Ban carrying over campaign funds from one election to the next.That would require congressional candidates to return leftover fundsto the contributors or give the money to the political parties orthe government.   _Curtail gerrymandering methods of drawing political districtlines to benefit one political party or group over another. Thedistricts would have to be drawn according to geographical andcommunity boundaries, said a senior administration official, whoacknowledged litigation would be the only way to enforce such laws.   _Require full disclosure of so-called ``soft money''contributions to political parties. Soft money refers generally tocorporate and labor donations that are barred in federal campaigns.Such money often takes a back channel path into federal campaignswhen the funds are contributed to political parties, which then helpthe candidates.   _Require disclosure by unions, corporations and tradeassociations of any money they spend for election activity, such asvoter registration drives.   _Restrict franking privileges, which allow members of Congress tosend mail to their constituents free. Blanket constituency mailings,such as the curent practice of sending newsletters, would be banned.   A group of GOP congressional leaders discussed the proposals withBush at the White House today and later praised him for taking aleadership role on the issue.   Although Congress has consistently squelched previous efforts torestrict PACS and make other campaign reforms, Rep. Guy Vander Jagt,R-Mich, said that will change because there exists in the country``a growing prairie fire where people are going to rise up and saywe'd like these elections back in our hands.''   Administration officials sought to emphasize the campaign reformproposals and downplay the pay-hike issue, which covers ground thepresident has trod before.   Bush endorsed a 51 percent salary increase for Congress,executive branch officials and judges in January at his first newsconference, but Congress squelched the pay hike under a firestorm ofcriticism in February.   In April, Bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federaljudges, a measure still pending in Congress. He has said he wantedto separate the question of congressional pay hikes from raises forjudges and executive branch officials, because the politicallysensitive Congress is skittish about raising its own pay.   By all accounts, there is little sentiment on Capitol Hill fordelving into the pay raise-honoraria flap again.   On the election law reform, Bush has been consulting with avariety of experts and met this week with advocacy groups that havelong criticized the current system as allowing special interestgroups to buy influence through a variety of backdoor campaigncontribution methods.   Bush won their praise for his direction, but they said he did notappear willing to take the dramatic steps they think will solve theproblem.   Ellen Miller, who heads the non-profit Center For ResponsivePolitics, said that disclosing contributions and expenditures ofsoft money will shed light on the sources but will not eliminate thepractice.   Fred Wertheimer, president of the lobby group Common Cause, saidabolishing corporate and union PACs but allowing non-connected PACswould merely allow people to reorganize PACs.</TEXT></DOC>
