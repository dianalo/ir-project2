Peggy Say, speaking at one of several ceremonies to markAnderson's 41st birthday Thursday _ his fourth as a hostage _ alsosaid reporters should not look for impropriety in negotiations tofree hostages.   ``I am not saying, `Give in to their demands.' I am saying,`Engage in dialogue.''' said Mrs. Say. ``Iran offered us a deal.They said, `Release our frozen assets and we will use our influenceto bring your hostages home.' We turned our back on it. We cannotafford to do that.''   Mrs. Say and journalists met with U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar, who condemned the hostages' captors asperpetrators of ``a crime against humanity.''   ``He did say he had some hope that something might develop beforeChristmas, maybe one, maybe two hostages. He did not go into it, buthe said he was hopeful,'' said David Aikman of The Journalists'Committee to Free Terry Anderson.   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., told reporters at a news conference:``Send the message to this administration that it is OK to cut adeal. Never has a hostage been freed without concessions beingmade.''   The Reagan administration repeatedly has said it will notnegotiate with those holding the hostages. It says that making dealswith captors only encourages further hostage-taking.   At the news conference, a poster-size birthday card was unveiled.It was drawn by Garry Trudeau, Anderson's favorite cartoonist, andwas signed by more than 1,000 journalists from 30 organizations.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was abducted in Beirut on March 16, 1985, by the pro-IranianShiite Moslem faction called Islamic Jihad, or Holy War. He has beenheld the longest of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in Lebanon.   ``I watched with desperation the coming of his birthdays as ahostage,'' freed French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann said throughan interpreter at the news conference. ``We ask today whether Terryeven is aware that it is his birthday.''   ``You should know that at this moment, as I speak to you, Terryis in chains. His eyes are blindfolded. He doesn't see the sun orthe light of day. ``Terry suffers physically. The most terriblething, though, for him, and I can tell you this because I was also ahostage ... is the feeling of having been abandoned. And I think heis right,'' said Kauffmann.   In other events marking Anderson's birthday:   _In Lorain, Ohio, where Anderson was born, friends and relativestied new yellow ribbons to City Hall flagposts and planned a partyin his honor.   _About 200 students at Buffalo State College in New York put onyellow armbands, cut a birthday cake, signed a huge card and sang``Happy Birthday.'' _In Batavia, N.Y., where Anderson grew up,residents lit one candle for each of the 1,321 days of his captivityon a big cake.   _A former hostage, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, collected birthdaycards for Anderson from children in Westminster, Calif., a LosAngeles suburb.   At a luncheon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mrs. Saysaid the print and broadcast media should play a more active role inpublicizing the plight of the hostages so they will be freed.   She said the presidential candidates have an ``unwrittenagreement'' that Anderson's captivity not become an issue. ``I'mafraid (the election) will come and go and Terry will still bethere,'' she said.   Kauffmann told the luncheon group that constant coverage by theFrench press and public opinion caused the French government to seekhis release.   ``Governments say that talking about hostages raises theransom,'' he said, ``but it's not true.''   Also Thursday, the militants holding Anderson denied any links toa woman who was arrested in Italy carrying a photograph of him.   The New York news conference was sponsored by the JournalistsCommittee to Free Terry Anderson, and No Greater Love, a non-profitsupport group for hostages' families.</TEXT></DOC>
