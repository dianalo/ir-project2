(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The alleged creator of a computer ``worm''that invaded and immobilized thousands of computers across thecountry in November has pleaded innocent to a felony charge.   In a five-minute arraignment Wednesday before U.S. MagistrateGustave DiBianco, Robert T. Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md., entered theplea to a one-count indictment handed up last week by a federalgrand jury.   The indictment charged Morris with gaining unauthorized accessto computers, preventing authorized access to computers and causinglosses in excess of $1,000 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Actof 1986. It is the first time felony charges have been broughtagainst an individual using the three-year-old law.   Federal prosecutors charge that Morris created the worm programthat clogged a computer network shared by colleges, researchcenters and the military.   It took several days to cleanse the system of the worm, whichmultiplied out of control, overloading the memories of the computersystems it invaded. Computer industry experts estimated the downtime and working hours needed to combat the worm cost from $5million to $12 million.   The suspended Cornell University graduate student was releasedon his own recognizance. He ignored reporters' questions during hiscourt appearance.   Thomas Guidoboni, Morris' attorney, would say only: ``They didcharge him and now they have to prove it.''   ``We want to preserve the integrity of the government's computersystem _ not just the government, but the entire computercommunity,'' said Justice Department attorney Mark Rasch.   If convicted, Morris faces a maximum five-year jail sentence and$250,000 fine.   According to the indictment, Morris' worm invaded computers atthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames ResearchCenter in California and the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command atWright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, as well as dozen ofuniversities.   The trial is not expected to begin before next year.</TEXT></DOC>
