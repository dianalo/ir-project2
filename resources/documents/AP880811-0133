Scientists said it was unclear whether pollution was playing arole in the deaths, and they called for international research.   Greenpeace said it will take direct, non-violent action in allcountries bordering the North and Baltic seas, including blockingpipelines that discharge toxic chemicals.   ``The time for words is gone,'' said Andy Booth, GreenpeaceInternational's North Sea coordinator.   ``Time is running out for these oceans,'' he said at a newsconference following the meeting of scientists from Britain,Denmark, Norway, Sweden, West Germany and the Netherlands.   Booth said Greenpeace will send the meeting's conclusions to theleaders of all governments bordering the North and Baltic seas andwill urge them to introduce urgent measures to ease pollution.   ``Greenpeace will be peacefully trying to prevent the flow ofcertain peristent man-made chemicals which we regard as toodangerous to be discharged into the marine environment,'' he added.Greenpeace did not reveal when or where it would try to blockpipelines.   Conference chairman Minnie Courtney said about 7,000 harborseals, have died in the North and Baltic Seas since April, out of apopulation of 15,000 to 16,000 seals.   In some areas up to half the harbor seals have died and thereare indications other seal species may become infected, she said.   Two viruses have been isolated among the dead seals, said Ms.Courtney, senior lecturer in biology at the University of London'sQueen Mary College, which co-sponsored the conference.   She added, however, that ``we don't understand why the diseaseshould have spread so quickly through the seals and we don'tunderstand why they are reacting to it so badly.''   ``There is no doubt that the Baltic and the North seas are verypolluted areas. They're some of the most polluted marine waters inthe world.''   Every year an estimateed 260,000 tons of liquid industrialwaste, 77 million tons of dredged materials and 5 million tons ofsewage sludge are discharged into the North Sea.   An international research project ``to study the effect ofenvironmental factors, including pollutants, on the immune systemof seals should be started immediately,'' Ms. Courtney said.   ``In the interim, every effort should be made to reduce theleakage of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) into the environment... Immediate, effective, precautionary measures should be taken tostop the discharge of other persistent pollutants.''   The viruses leave the seals suffering from a variety ofsymptoms, including lethargy, diarrhea, skin lesions andspontaneous abortions. Autopsies show inflamed brains and otherorgans.   The scienists said there have been similar cases of mass sealdeaths in non-polluted waters.   Sheila Anderson of Britain's Sea Mammal Research Unit said 400harbor seals died off the New England coast in 1979-80, and 2,000crab-eater seals died in the Antarctic in 1955. In both cases, thecause of death was thought to be viral pneumonia.   But Ms. Courtney said there is evidence from other animals thatPCBs, dioxins and other toxic chemicals in the North and Balticseas can interefere with immune systems.   ``The seas are contaminated with a very complex mixture of toxicchemicals, some of which are discharged in millions of tonsannually,'' she said. ``The individual action and the ....interactions of these are poorly understood and cannot be excludedas an additional factor in the seal deaths.''</TEXT></DOC>
