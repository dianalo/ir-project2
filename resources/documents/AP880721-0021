Solzhenitsyn is emphatically denying reports that Kremlinofficials have invited her husband to return to his homeland,saying ``someone is playing a game on us.''   Natalya Solzhenitsyn, in a rare interview Wednesday, told TheAssociated Press it is too early to speculate on whether Sovietauthorities will invite him back after 14 years in exile or publishhis books, as was reported.   ``Someone is playing a game on us,'' she said by telephone fromtheir home in rural Vermont. ``We never received any telephone callor letter from Soviet officials about publishing his books there orabout us returning to the Soviet Union.''   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn also said her husband was making no publiccomment on the reforms of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Solzhenitsyn, who will turn 70 on Dec. 11, has maintained apublic silence since 1983, two years before Gorbachev rose to power.   ``He stopped speaking publicly five years ago because of hisliterary work,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said. ``He made a decision todevote full efforts to literary tasks. It is hard to be both apublic and a literary figure.''   Asked whether they hoped that Soviet authorities would publishhis books or invite the family to return home, Mrs. Solzhenitsynsaid: ``In my opinion, it is not proper to answer a question thathas not been asked. It is not time to speculate.''   In 1962, under the reforms of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,the literary magazine ``Novy Mir'' published one of Solzhenitsyn'snovels, ``A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' a grim chronicleof life in a Soviet prison camp. The book was based onSolzhenitsyn's own camp term, the theme that has dominated his work.   Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, the thaw ended, andSolzhenitsyn's works were banned in the Soviet Union.   They were smuggled to the West and published, however, winningSolzhenitsyn the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970. He did notleave the Soviet Union to collect the award, for fear his returnwould be blocked.   Solzhenitsyn was exiled in 1974 following publication in theWest of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' a multivolume chronicle of theprison camps, or ``gulags,'' which he said stretched like a hiddenchain of islands across the Soviet Union.   Although Soviet authorities are now rewriting official historiesto mention, for the first time, the millions of people who sufferedand died under Kremlin dictator Josef Stalin, Solzhenitsyn's worksstill are banned, in part because he was harshly critical ofVladimir Lenin, revered as the founder of the Soviet state.   The appearance of many Soviet works critical of Stalin hasprompted wide speculation, and persistent news reports, thatKremlin officials would allow publication of Solzhenitsyn's works.   Last month, Sergei P. Zalygin, the current editor of ``NovyMir,'' told reporters he was negotiating with Solzhenitsyn topublish his novel, ``Cancer Ward,'' in the Soviet Union.   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn denied the report. ``Up to now, we neverreceived any communication from Soviet authorities on thepublication of any of his books.''   ``The only letter we ever received from Soviet officials was in1976, a letter from the Soviet Embassy in Washington informing methat I was being deprived of my Soviet citzenship because of myactivities,'' she said. ``My husband has received nothing.''   She also denied a report by a Bavarian radio station quoting herhusband as saying he had received two letters from Gorbachev.   The station, Bayerischer Rundfunk, based in Munich, reportedlast Friday that Solzhenitsyn had accepted an invitation fromGorbachev and that his books would be published there. At the time,Solzhenitsyn issued a statement denying the report.   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn became a U.S. citizen in 1985. Sovietauthorities also revoked her husband's citizenship, and he has notbecome the citizen of any other country.</TEXT></DOC>
