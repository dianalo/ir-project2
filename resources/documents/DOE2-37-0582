<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0582 </DOCNO><TEXT>Magnetic resonance (MR) angioimaging was performed on patients with cerebrovasculardiseases using three different techniques with a HITACHI G-10 (0.15 tesla)apparatus and a G-50 (0.5 tesla) apparatus. Direct (conventional) cerebralMR angioimaging employing the ''flow void'' phenomenon was useful forthe evaluation of intracranial arterial diseases, such as intracranialaneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. For this purpose, a conventionalspin-echo sequence with a long Tr (2000 - 3000 msec) and a short Te (30- 50 msec) could delineate only the fast flowing vessels with a markedlow-signal intensity, while other intracranial structures were shownas iso- or high-signal intensities. ECG-gated subtraction MR angioimagingwas used only for the diagnosis of peripheral vessel diseases, becausethe intracranial vessels were not delineated clearly by this technique.A sequence subtraction technique with a rephased and a dephased sequencewas used for the detection of diseases of cervical vessels and the intracranialvenous system such as vascular obstructions. In conclusion, cerebralMR angioimaging is of diagnostic value for cervical and intracranialvascular diseases.</TEXT></DOC>
