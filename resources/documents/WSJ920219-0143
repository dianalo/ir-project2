The new rules would provide a roadmap for research,testing and commercialization of products, including newstrains of crops and microbes used to clean coal or producefuel. As reported, the initial rule would eliminate manyfield tests now required for genetically engineeredpesticides. But the structure now envisioned would go farbeyond pesticides to guide regulatory treatment of allbiotech products -- including those not even conceived yet --that will spread into the atmosphere. The goal is to spurdevelopment of this non-drug segment of biotechnology.</LP><TEXT>   The $4 billion industry today consists nearly entirely ofpharmaceuticals. But the administration anticipates that theindustry will grow to $50 billion in the next 10 years, withmuch of the growth in non-drug areas such as agriculture,manufacturing and environmental restoration. Products inthese areas have been slow in coming, partly because ofregulatory hurdles that the administration wants todismantle. So far, about 300 products have beenexperimentally field-tested, in anticipation of commercialdevelopment.   At the heart of the proposed framework is the principlethat products made by genetic engineering are generally nodifferent than products made by conventional means and don'trequire special treatment. A draft report by an interagencyworking group on biotechnology applies that principle toproducts that would be released into the environment. Thereport says such products should be regulated only if theypose an &quot;unreasonable risk&quot; -- when the benefit of protectingpublic health clearly outweighs the cost of regulation.   The new structure is expected to be adopted by the workinggroup, headed by White House Counselor Boyden Gray, as earlyas today. The group had been split for five years over thepolicy, with the Environmental Protection Agency, which hasargued for stricter controls, pitted against White Houseofficials. But the effort to resolve the controversy got abig boost from President Bush's drive to deregulate.   Richard Godown, president of the Industrial BiotechnologyAssociation, said that the adoption of the regulatoryframework would especially help speed the commercializationof food and agricultural products. &quot;It's telling federalagencies: Where there is no perceptible risk, don't apply theheavy hand of government.&quot;   But environmentalists immediately attacked the proposaland said that easing regulation would endanger the public.Margaret Mellon, a biotech specialist at the NationalWildlife Federation, said the White House could use theframework to force agencies to scrap rules requiringcompanies to field-test new biotech products and requiringresearchers to guard against releasing new organisms into theatmosphere during laboratory work.   The first set of regulations under the new approach willbe those designed to govern the experimental release ofgenetically engineered pesticides. The rules, would exemptmany companies from having to seek EPA approval beforeconducting small-scale field tests to see if the productsdamage the environment.   But the White House's plans for biotechnology range farbeyond pesticides. The Agriculture Department, for instance,last year proposed rules to oversee the $180 million ingrants it doles out annually. Under the rules, researcherswould have been expected to determine how best to isolatetheir experiments by analyzing the danger posed by theorganisms and the ability of the organisms to spread. ButWhite House and Agriculture Department officials now say theywill have to rewrite those proposals, so that researcherswould consider the cost of confining an experiment.</TEXT></DOC>
