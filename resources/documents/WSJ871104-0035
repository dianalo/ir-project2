Would it surprise you to learn these statements are implied by mainstream neoclassical economics?    The government is free to label its receipts and payments any way it wants. When it takes in money from the private sector it makes an accounting, not an economic, choice whether to label those receipts &quot;taxes&quot; or &quot;borrowing.&quot; When it pays money out, it makes an accounting, not an economic, choice whether to label those payments &quot;spending&quot; or &quot;return of principal plus interest.&quot; Since the &quot;deficit&quot; equals &quot;spending&quot; less &quot;taxes,&quot; the &quot;deficit,&quot; too, is totally arbitrary.    Take, as an illustration, the government's accounting of Social Security. When workers pay money to Social Security, the payments are called &quot;taxes&quot;; when they get money back in old age, the payments are called &quot;government spending on transfer payments.&quot; Suppose, instead, that the government had chosen to label its Social Security receipts from workers as &quot;borrowing&quot; (giving them a piece of paper entitled Social Security Bond in the process) and its Social Security payments to retirees as &quot;repayment of principal plus interest&quot; (taking back the piece of paper in the process). This alternative choice of language, while of no real difference to workers or retirees, would have totally altered the official deficit. Had the government used this alternative language, it would have reported annual deficits in the 1970s (when Social Security was cranked up) as high as $600 billion and a huge, roughly $1 trillion surplus in 1983 (when Social Security was cranked down).    As a second illustration, suppose the government takes the roughly $160 billion dollars it says it's &quot;borrowing&quot; this year from the public and simply relabels these receipts as &quot;taxes.&quot; Let it also relabel the future repayment of &quot;principal plus interest&quot; as &quot;transfer payments.&quot; Clearly this relabeling should have no economic impact; if you are giving money to the government today that it returns to you in the future with interest, you don't care how it labels the payments; all you care about is how much you're giving up today and how much you're getting back tomorrow. While it makes no difference to you, by relabeling this year's &quot;borrowing&quot; as &quot;taxes&quot; the government's reported &quot;deficit&quot; will be zero.    In addition to choosing labels any way it wants, the government can choose the timing of its receipts and payments in ways that have no economic effect, but can dramatically alter the measured deficit. For example, suppose Washington announces a large tax increase this year coupled with a tax credit in the future equal to this year's extra tax plus interest (and payable to the estates of anyone who dies prior to claiming the credit). While not changing the present value of anyone's taxes, the policy, depending on the size of the additional tax, could eliminate all outstanding government debt and permit the government to report an enormous surplus.    These examples are not unique. Every dollar the government takes in or pays out is arbitrarily labeled and could just as well be labeled something different. Every dollar the government takes in (pays out) today, could, instead, be taken in (paid out) tomorrow in a manner that doesn't change the present value of anyone's tax payments. Hence, according to mainstream, neoclassical economics, the government can run any real economic policy while at the same time announcing any size deficit or surplus it wants.    Relying on time-honored, historic labeling practices doesn't get around the problem. In the Social Security example, the fact that some politicians in the 1930s used one set of words rather than another doesn't preclude our considering a different historic choice of words and, as a consequence, reaching the conclusion that we ran huge surpluses rather than huge deficits in the 1980s.    If our official numbers on &quot;taxes,&quot; &quot;spending&quot; and &quot;deficits&quot; are each inherently arbitrary, what numbers should one look at to gauge fiscal policy and what would such numbers tell us is the true stance of fiscal policy? The answer is that we need to construct generational accounts that indicate the present value of what each generation is expected to pay, on net, over its lifetime to the government. Such generational accounts would be unaffected by accounting labels and pure changes in the timing of government payments and receipts. They would tell us how different generations will share in the burden of paying for the government's consumption and reveal the tightness of fiscal policy. Tight fiscal policy would correspond to policy that placed a larger share of the burden of paying for the government's consumption on current as opposed to future generations.    From the perspective of such generational accounts the fiscal policy of the Reagan administration has been relatively tight, certainly much tighter than the fiscal policy of the 1970s; in contrast to then, 1980s fiscal policy did not make current generations better off to the detriment of future generations. Younger Americans lost on average about $12,000 in present value from the 1983 change in Social Security. This loss was roughly equal to their average present value gain from the income-tax cuts. Older Americans actually weren't greatly affected by the change in Social Security and did benefit from the tax cuts; but the 1981 shift in effective taxation away from income toward consumption placed a larger share of the tax burden on the elderly and, at least through 1986, largely offset their gains from the income-tax cut.    The argument here is quite different from suggestions that we need to adjust the &quot;deficit&quot; for inflation, government assets, and unfunded liabilities of government retirement programs. Rather than produce a better arbitrary number, we need to throw out the deficit numbers completely because they don't measure what needs to be measured.    The point here is also quite different from the debate concerning whether &quot;deficits&quot; matter. I believe that fiscal policy matters a lot, particularly intergenerational redistribution, but that the deficits tell us nothing useful about the true intergenerational stance of fiscal policy. From that perspective, debating whether the &quot;deficit&quot; matters or, for that matter, whether we should pass a balanced-budget amendment, is like asking whether the emperor's shoes match his new clothes.    Blowing the whistle on the &quot;deficits&quot; is a bold task. Politicians of many persuasions, the press, financial analysts and popular economists have a lot at stake in perpetuating deficit delusion. But now is certainly a moment for truth.    ---   Mr. Kotlikoff chairs the economics department at Boston University and is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research. </TEXT></DOC>
