Heattreatment for the formation of a glass-ceramic matrix can be performedimmediately after the composite's drawing. Marshall's (1984) method canbe used to determine the interfacial stress in a variety of fiber/matrixconfigurations. Interfacial stresses depend on fiber/matrix reactions,mechanical interactions, and thermal expansion mismatch between fiberand matrix.</TEXT></DOC>
