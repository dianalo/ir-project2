 Remote Accessenables processor console functions to be controlled from a stand-aloneremote operation console, AT or PS/2 Model 30, 50Z, 70, or 80.andP;  Functionsinclude system unit power-on control, System/370 manual operations, 3270Display emulation, and configuration and customizing aids.andP;  Remote Accessalso enables 9371 Processor console functions to be controlled from another9371 Processor.andP;  Models 10 and 12 must be connected to a switched telephoneline to provide the Remote Support Facility and the Remote OperationFacility.andP;  The standard Remote Facilities Adaptor, Remote Facilities Optioncable, and a 5853 Modem are used for this connection.andP;  On the communicationsfront, attachment options include a system board async serial port thatprovides serial asynchronous communication at a maximum line speed of 9,600bps.andP;  The system board parallel printer port supports the 420X Proprinter orother compatible printers.andP;  A dual async adaptor provides two serialasynchronous, 9,600bps maximum communication ports.andP;  The eight-port RS-232Cadaptor, eight-port RS-232C/RS422A adaptor with four EIA RS-232C and fourRS422A ports, and the eight-port RS422A adaptor provide eight communicationports.andP;  All are capable of asynchronous communication and two of the RS-232Cports are capable of either asynchronous, synchronous, or bisynccommunication.andP;  Only one type of synchronous protocol is allowed on these twoports, but each port can support line speeds of up to 19,200bps.andP;  The RS-232Cinterface is used to attach devices up to 50 feet away, and the RS422Ainterface is used to attach devices up to 4,000 feet without a modem.andP;  TheRS-232C interface can also be used with a modem.andM;The maximum number of lines and maximum data rates supported by oneEight-Port Adaptor are dependent on the line speeds selected and the mix ofprotocols.andP;  The high performance SDLC adaptor provides one port that can beused for SDLC communication at line speeds up to 64Kbps.andP;  Physical interfacessupported are RS-232C/V24, V35, and X21 leased and circuit-switched lines.andO;External connections to an attached modem or equivalent device are supported.andO;If the V35 direct connection cable is used, direct connection to an SNAcontroller is supported.andP;  The X25/HDLC packet network adaptor adaptorprovides one interface port that supports X25/high-level data link controlcommunication at line speeds ranging from 2,400bps to 64Kbps.andP;  Physicalinterfaces supported are X21 bis/V24/RS-232C, X21 bis/V35, and X21 and thefeature provides physical and data link layers for connecting to X25packet-switched networks - but the packet layer must be provided byappropriate System/370 software.andP;  The Token-Ring adaptor provides access to a4Mbps or 16Mbps Token-Ring Network.andP;  The IEEE 802.3 local area networkadaptor provides communication with 9370s, other vendors' systems, andworkstations compatible with Ethernet.andP;  The Eight-Port Adaptors can beprogrammed to handle a variety of protocols and each has 512Kb memory, andthree additional Eight-Port Adaptors have 1Mb of memory.andP;  The 512Kb adaptorscannot be upgraded to the 1Mb adaptors.andP;  PS/2 software is available tosupport the creation and loading of programs for the Realtime InterfaceCo-Processor Multiport/2, which can be used on these adaptors and used tocustomise the adaptors for use on the Model 10 and Model 12.andP;  System/370applications can use the Serial OEM Interface access method macros to accessthe customised adaptors.andP;  Additional SDLC communication function includesX21, LPDA-2 support, and Type 2.1 node boundary function support.andP;  Functionsin the 4331/4361 Communication Adaptor or the 9370 TelecommunicationsSubsystem that are not implemented are X25 Packet Layer CommunicationSubsystem for non-SNA networks, IBM Terminal Control Type 1 support, andsupport for the Dynamic Trace Feature.andM;Local and remote displays supportedandM;The 3151 Monochrome ASCII Display Station Models 310 and 410 are supported in3278-2 emulation mode and 3278-5 emulation mode - with the appropriate 3151Expansion Cartridge.andP;  9371 Model 10 and Model 12 adaptors supporting ASCIIdevices operating at between 600bps and 19.2Kbps in full duplex mode includelocal attachment via RS-232C or RS422A and remote attachment via RS-232C overleased or switched lines with an appropriate modem.andP;  Dual AsyncAdaptor -9,600bps maximum; System Board Serial Ports - 9,600bps maximum; and all theEight-Port Adaptors are also supported.andP;  Support is also provided forattaching eligible printers to the RS-232C Async Serial Port on the 3151.andO;Group Multiplex Mode is a standard capability that enables users to transferdata to or from multiple ASCII terminals using a single start input-outputinstruction.andP;  It can be used with the asynchronous ports of the Eight-PortAdaptors and in some character-mode applications.andP;  The 3270 adaptor providesthree coax ports for the attachment of 3270 terminal and printer types.andP;  The3299 Terminal Multiplexer can be used to expand the number of attachments to24.andP;  SNA and non-SNA capability is provided.andP;  The 3174 Subsystem Control UnitModels 91R and 61R can be attached to a Model 10 or Model 12 with the HighPerformance SDLC Adaptor or the synchronous ports of the 8-Port Adaptors.andO;The Model 63R can be attached to the Token-Ring Adaptor.andP;  This attachmentsupports all 3270 terminal and printer types supported by these controllers.andO;The 3299 Multiplexer can also be used to reduce cabling costs and to expandthe number of attachments.andP;  The 5080 graphics adaptor can be used to attachup to four 5085 Model 2A or 5086 Graphics Processors.andM;Most 9370 printers are supportedandM;The 4201, 4202, 4207, 4208, 4234 dot band model 13, 5204 Quickwriter and 4019laser printers can link to a system board parallel port or to any serialasynchronous RS-232C adaptor port in 3287 or 4245 compatibility mode.andP;  Theycan also connect to the 3151 Display Station serial port in 3287compatibility mode.andP;  4224 Printer Models 301, 3E3, 302, and 3C2 attach to anyserial asynchronous RS-232C adaptor port in 3287 or 4245 compatibility modeand can also connect to the 3151 Display Station serial port in 3287compatibility mode.andP;  The 3820 can be attached to the SDLC ports of theEight-Port Adaptors or the High Performance SDLC Adaptor and the 3812 pageprinter can use any available bisync ports.andP;  A high speed printer adaptorsupports the 3825, 3827, and 3835 Page Printers and the 6262 Impact LinePrinter Models 14 and 22; all printers that link to the 3174 SubsystemControl Unit 91R, 61R and 63R are also supported.andP;  - Janice McGinn.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
