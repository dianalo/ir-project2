The system was aimed at demonstrating the technicaland economic viability of a stand-alone PV system to power various appliancesfor an off-grid health/administrative centre in rural communities inCanada or developing countries. This paper describes the design and implementationof the system and its accompanying monitoring system, and presents someperformance results. The electical energy used fluctuated within theprojected load figures of 5-8.6 kWh/d and the energy collected rangedfrom 7 to 12 kWh/d. It was generally found that the system more thanmeets design specifications. 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
