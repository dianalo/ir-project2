Some private analysts argue that the Fed should ease moneypolicies at next week's meeting because a 20% drop in gold'sprice since February means inflation fears are receding. ButFed officials see other reasons for the fall: The Sovietshave been selling gold to help their lagging economy, andMideast traders have been dumping gold in anticipation offurther Soviet sales.</LP><TEXT>   Even the Fed's leading gold bug, Wayne Angell, has saidgold would have to drop below $350 an ounce before he'd getconcerned; it's currently floating just above that level.Bush officials look to new Fed member David Mullins to leadthe way to lower interest rates. But he is said to beconcerned about establishing credibility at the Fed beforebecoming active.   The White House hopes its new tax stand, which raiseshopes for cutting the deficit, will encourage the Fed toease.                                                                                                          FARM SUBSIDIES shape up as a divisive issue at theeconomic summit.   Officials of the seven nations that will meet in Houstonnext month fail so far to forge a compromise framework forsettling disputes over agriculture. Without some movement, itwill be up to Bush and the other leaders to resolve theimpasse with the European Community. The issue threatens tostymie the whole round of international trade liberalizationtalks.   The Europeans want to lump together different kinds ofsupport for agriculture, such as export and productionsubsidies, and reduce that total. But the U.S. and Canada,along with other food exporters, want to focus on specificsubsidies. Otherwise, they fear, the EC won't adequatelyaddress its $9 billion a year in farm export subsidies.                                                                                                          BUSH BACKS a major revamping of NATO, but resists somechanges.   Alliance leaders will map strategy changes when they meetin London next week. A key revision will be to reducefrontline defenses in Germany and put the forces underofficers from several NATO countries. The challenge is &quot;to besure NATO is seen by Western publics to adapt&quot; to the changesin Europe, one senior Bush aide says.   The underlying political goal: to get Moscow to accept aunited Germany inside the Western alliance. But the U.S.wants to put off discussion of withdrawing short-rangenuclear arms from Europe until next year's talks with theSoviets. And Bush aides rule out declaring that the Westwould never be first to use nuclear weapons.   Britain and France fear that talk of &quot;de-nuclearizing&quot;Germany would generate public pressure to dismantle their ownnuclear arsenals.                                                                                                          NO NEW -- WHOOPS] Republicans are undercut by Bush's taxturnabout. GOP Rep. Gingrich had just mailed a fund-raisingplea for the National Tax Limitation Committee attackingpro-tax &quot;liberal elites&quot; and vowing &quot;to fight them to thefinish on this make-or-break issue.&quot;                                                                                                          GRUMBLING GROWS that former quarterback Kemp is becoming alonesome end. A message sent to administration officials tokeep quiet about Bush's statement accepting new taxes waslargely aimed at Kemp, who had spoken against such action.Kemp's criticism of the GOP candidate for New York governor,economist Pierre Rinfret, also rankles Republicans.                                                                                                          MANDELA HOPES his good reception in the U.S. will help himpersuade Thatcher to weaken her opposition to South Africasanctions when he meets with her. His aides say the recentdecision by the EC to maintain sanctions also strengthens hisarguments to the British leader.                                                                                                          WIVES AND AUTHORS: Michigan Republicans hoping forpre-election bombshells in a book by Democratic Gov. JamesBlanchard's former wife will be disappointed. So says PaulaBlanchard, who even plans to vote for her ex-husband. Theformer wife of the GOP candidate, John Engler, also haswritten a book but hasn't found a publisher.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS COMPETE with one another in the scramble forelection funds.   Party leaders hope to pump at least $5 million into HarveyGantt's strong bid to upset North Carolina Sen. Helms, whomay raise $16 million. Ann Richards needs at least $8 millionfor her Texas gubernatorial race against Clayton Williams,who may spend $20 million. Dianne Feinstein hopscotchesCalifornia to raise $500,000 this week for her governorshipfight against the well-funded Pete Wilson.   Some Democrats grumble that &quot;big foot&quot; candidates whodon't need money soak up donations. New Jersey Sen. Bradley,who faces minimal opposition, has raised more than $5million; he even had a fund-raiser in North Carolina lastyear, but doesn't plan to donate to Gantt. Sens. Cranston,Daschle and Sanford troll for money even though they don'trun until 1992.   The 118 Senate candidates from both parties for 1990 havealready raised over $83 million and spent $47 million.
