McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New home sales took their steepest dive innearly eight years last month while the government's chief economicforecasting gauge registered only a small increase, the governmentreported Tuesday.   Analysts said they anticipate sluggish growth ahead, but fewsaid they see danger signals of a recession in the near future.Despite the sharp decline in home sales, economists forecastimprovement in that industry as mortgage rates decline.   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators, designedto foretell economic activity six to nine months in advance, inchedup 0.2 percent in September.   At the same time, the department reported new home sales dropped14 percent, the sharpest decrease since a 19 percent decline inJanuary 1982 during the last recession.   In a third report, the Labor Department said employers' costsfor wages and benefits of workers climbed 1.6 percent in the thirdquarter and 5.1 percent in the past year, with health insurancepremiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace thansalaries.   Many housing economists questioned the September home salesreport and suggested a more accurate reading of the industry wouldbe obtained by averaging sales of both new and existing homes overthe entire third quarter.   ``That shows overall strength in the housing market,'' said JohnA. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association ofRealtors.   Analysts see falling mortgage rates leading to continued butslow growth in the housing industry for the remainder of the year,similar to that projected by the leading indicators for the overalleconomy.   The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve appliedthe brakes last year to dampen inflation. But while inflationappears to be abating, some analysts are concerned the Fed's gripcould thrust the economy into recession.   The small increase in the leading index followed a revisedAugust advance of 0.5 percent. The often-volatile index was alsorevised in July to show no change after dipping 0.1 percent in June.   Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co., called theSeptember figure ``the fourth anemic report in the last fivemonths'' and said it ``signals a major slowdown, a flirtation withrecession.''   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage BankersAssociation, said, ``This number gives us a pretty good assessmentof where we stand _ no recession but at least two quarters ofsluggish growth,'' said   An index measuring consumer expectations was the largestpositive contributor among last month's leading indicators and themajor cause for the August and July revisions.   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation'seconomic activity, has accounted for much of the year's growth sofar.   ``As long as confidence holds up, we probably won't have arecession,'' Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for theWEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said. He and other economistsbelieve consumer spending will be substantially weaker in the lastquarter of the year, however.   Other positive contributors were growth in the money supply, duein part to lower inflation, a longer average work week, and higherstock prices.   But the other seven statistics, mainly in the manufacturingsector, pointed down _ a decrease in manufacturers' new orders forconsumer goods, a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders, fewerorders for plant and equipment, faster vendor performance, meaningdeclining demand, higher initial unemployment claims, fewerbuilding permits, and lower prices for sensitive materialsindicating weakening demand.   The strong service and consumption sectors and the weakness inmanufacturing led chief economist David Berson of the FederalNational Mortgage Association to describe the economy as having a``split personality.''   The various changes left the index at 145 percent of its 1982base of 100. So far this year, the index has fallen at an annualrate of 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent forthe first nine months of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
