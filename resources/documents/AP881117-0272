ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The epic takeover battle for RJR Nabisco Inc. hasbeen muddled further by Forstmann Little andamp; Co.'s announcement thatit will not submit a bid for the food and tobacco giant.   Forstmann Little, a corporate buyout specialist, stated Wednesdaythat the investor group it led had decided that ``consistent withits investment criteria, it will not submit a proposal.''   The group's decision left two major known suitors for RJRNabisco, which is accepting sealed bids from prospective buyersuntil Friday, and caused Nabisco's stock to tumble on speculationthat the bidding war may go no higher.   At the same time, a possible new bid may emerge from a groupconsisting of First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings Ltd., a NewYork investment banking concern backed by the wealthy Pritzkerfamily of Chicago and billionaire investor Philip Anschutz ofDenver, the Wall Street Journal reported today.   Quoting unidentified sources, the newspaper said the First Bostongroup had advanced a vague proposal that called for payment at leastpartly in securities instead of cash. No amount was disclosed andthe proposal was given a dim chance of success, the Journal said.   Officials at Resource Holdings declined comment. First Bostonofficials did not immediately return phone calls this morning.   ``There are 20 different scenarios on how this could shape up,''said Mary English, a food industry analyst with the investment firmof Furman, Selz after Forstmann Little's announcement Wednesday.   The takeover maneuvering was further complicated by a majorlawsuit filed against RJR Nabisco management today in New York byMetropolitan Life Insurance Co., a big holder of the company's bonds.   The suit claims the buyout strategies pursued by management havedevastated the value of those bonds because they raise the prospectof nearly quadrupling RJR Nabisco's debt.   It was the second such court action filed in two days andreflected a growing rebellion of bondholders against debt-financedtakeovers. On Tuesday, ITT Corp., another big holder of RJR Nabiscobonds, sued the company on grounds its portfolio has been hurt. RJRhas declined comment on the suits.   Before RJR Nabisco's special committee of outside directorsimplemented bidding procedures on Nov. 7, two offers had been madepublic _ a $20.3 billion, or $90-a-share, bid from the investmentfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc., and a $20.7 billion, or$92-a-share, offer by an investment group led by RJR Nabisco's topmanagers.   Although there are prospects that the two bidders could make ajoint offer for the company, previous attempts to do so have brokendown.   And Wednesday's announcement came as a disappointment toinvestors, because ``that knocks out one of three that could haveafforded something of this magnitude,'' Ms. English said.   Forstmann Little had said any proposal it made would top themanagement and Kohlberg Kravis offers.   RJR Nabisco stock dropped $4.50 a share to $84 in New York StockExchange composite trading Wednesday.   Forstmann Little's announcement came three weeks after it heldtalks with the RJR Nabisco management group and considered joiningthat bid for the company. It then assembled a rival group consistingof Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Ralston Purina Co., Castle andamp; Cooke Inc. andGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   RJR Nabisco's president, F. Ross Johnson, who leads the managerstrying to buy the company, has the backing of the investment firmsShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc.   When the RJR Nabisco board committee announced it would takesealed bids for the company, it also said it was considering thepossible sale of the firm's food businesses in advance of anytakeover.   The proceeds of any sale would be paid to shareholders before anyacquisition of RJR Nabisco, the committee said.   The food businesses accounted for about 60 percent of thecompany's $15.8 billion in 1987 net sales. Industry analysts haveestimated the businesses would bring a sale price ranging from $12.5billion to $15.5 billion.   Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco makes such well-known brands as Winstonand Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Del Monte vegetables.   If any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company, it would bethe biggest corporate acquisition ever. The RJR Nabisco managementand Kohlberg Kravis bids already dwarf the $13.4 billion spent inthe 1984 acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
