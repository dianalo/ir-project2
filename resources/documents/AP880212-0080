Haig Jr. ended his quixoticquest for the presidency Friday, endorsing Kansas Sen. Bob Dole andattacking Vice President George Bush as no more than a spectator inReagan administration councils.   Asked his opinion of Bush's involvement in importantdecision-making, the former secretary of state said Bush had merely``been there, period.''   More than 200 reporters and at least 30 television cameras werein the room for Haig's announcement, by far the most coverage hereceived at any time in his year-long campaign. He withdrew fromthe race for the Republican presidential nomination at a newsconference on a day when a snowstorm played havoc with theschedules of the remaining candidates.   He opened by saying his assessment of the race had made it clearthat ``Al Haig will not be the 1988 Republican nominee.''   Haig received less than 1 percent of the vote in the Iowaprecinct caucuses on Monday and was receiving only about 1 percentsupport in polls of Republican voters in New Hampshire.   He endorsed Dole as the candidate who ``embodies best myunderstanding of the crucial challenges we face.''   Dole appeared briefly at Haig's side to say the endorsement``means a great deal to me personally'' and that the former NATOcommander had told him he wanted no role in a Dole administration.   While free with his praise of Dole, Haig seemed to relish evenmore his attacks on Bush.   ``What have you got against George Bush?'' Haig was asked.   ``Not a single thing in terms of George Bush,'' he replied.``He's a friend, I've known him for 20 years.''   But he went on to say that he had worked with both men for twodecades and ``from my point of view, Bob Dole is head and shouldersabove George Bush as a potential president.''   ``Most important of all,'' he said, Dole exceeds Bush in ``thedemeanor, the internal strength, the ability to deal eyeball toeyeball with those who do not share our values around the world.''   Bush later phoned WKNE in Keene to boast that he won theimmediate endorsement of state Rep. Edward Bennett of Bridgewater,one of Haig's three state co-chairman.   Then on Manchester television, Bush said Bennett ``thinks thatI'm head and shoulders above Bob Dole.''   Haig's greatest contribution to the Dole campaign may well havecome earlier, during televised debates when he pressed Bush on hisrole in the Iran-Contra affair and asked him if he had been ``inthe cockpit or ... on an economy ride in the back of the plane'' asvice president.   When asked Friday about reports of Bush involvement withPanamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Haig said, ``I dothink there's been less than forthright discussion of this issue bythe vice president.''   Haig withdrew four days before the New Hampshire primary, andwhen asked about the timing he replied in a sentence typical ofwhat had become known during his public career as Haigspeak:   ``It takes a bit of arrogance to be so ego-involved in acampaign such as this that you want to take the few percentagepoints that could be critical to another candidate to the politicalgraveyard.   ``I'm not that way. I want to make a difference.''   As a candidate, the 63-year-old retired general who hadannounced last year he was ``throwing my helmet into the ring'' wasoften openly critical of Reagan administration domestic and foreignpolicies.   Speaking with the authority of having been Reagan's firstsecretary of state, Haig has criticized the president's approach inthe Persian Gulf and also has opposed the INF treaty to eliminatemedium-range missiles from Europe.   On domestic issues, he has said the record federal budgetdeficits of the Reagan years stemmed, in part, from the policiespursued by the administration, making him the only candidate otherthan Dole to lay some of the blame somewhere other than on Congress.   In campaign appearances Haig was fond of saying he had servedunder seven presidents and recalling his strong role as chief ofstaff in the White House during the final months of Richard M.Nixon's presidency.   At a Republican dinner in Nashua Wednesday night he quipped,``I'm the only one (of the GOP candidates) who's been presidentbefore and I liked it.''</TEXT></DOC>
