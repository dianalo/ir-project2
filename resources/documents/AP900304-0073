The Temple, on Atlanta's Peachtree Street and featured in thecurrent movie ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' was evacuated Saturdaymorning during a bat mitzvah, service for a 12-year-old girl.   A bogus bomb, containing wires, a clock and batteries _ as wellas some confusing messages _ was left in The Temple's frontdoorway, under a Hebrew inscription proclaiming The Temple a``house of prayer for all peoples.''   ``That (inscription) is a sign of welcome _ inclusiveness, nothatred,'' said Rabbi Alvin M. Sugarman. The phony bomb, he said,``had the effect of hatred.''   ``I'm amazed at this,'' said William B. Schwartz, who waspresident of The Temple in 1958, when the building was heavilydamaged in a pre-dawn bombing. ``I thought we had come a long wayover the years.''   Whoever left this weekend's phony bomb ``wanted us to believe itwas a bomb,'' said Atlanta Police Sgt. W.H. Briley. ``He made it tolook like a bomb.''   The package, according to police, also contained videotapes ofnews reports about anti-abortion protests, and several messages,including some referring to Coretta Scott King, widow of civilrights leader Martin Luther King Jr.; former First Lady RosalynnCarter; and a local TV anchorwoman. The messages weren'tanti-Semitic or racial threats, said police Capt. J.R. Spence.   ``There were several messages that made no sense,'' he said.   The Temple, Atlanta's largest Reform congregation with 5,000members at present, was bombed Sunday morning, Oct. 12, 1958.Police estimated that 30 to 50 sticks of dynamite were set off justoutside an entrance, and a 20-foot hole was blown in the building.No one was hurt.   President Eisenhower ordered FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover toassist Atlanta Police in investigating, and five men were arrested,but none was convicted.   The bomb was intended to quiet clergy support for Atlanta schoolintegration efforts at a time of racial tension, but it had justthe opposite effect, said Mark R. Jacobsen, present director of TheTemple.   ``People referred to the bomb as something that unified theAtlanta community,' Jacobsen recalled. ``The Christian communityand the black community all rallied to The Temple's side to helprebuild it. The message of love prevailed.''   Atlanta Constitution editor Ralph McGill won a Pulitzer Prizefor a column about the bombing, condeming ``those so-calledChristian ministers who have chosen to preach hate instead ofcompassion.''   The bombing is depicted in the ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' a movieabout an older Atlanta Jewish woman's friendship with her blackchauffeur.   About 150 people were evacuated from The Temple Saturday as12-year-old Pam Epstein was reading from the Torah during her batmitzvah. ``I thought I was going to cry, because I wanted this tobe very special,'' she said.   But the ceremony concluded, with a kiss from Miss Epstein'sgrandfather.   ``That was the amen to the prayer,'' Sugarman said. ``What willendure here is not the act of hate, but the beauty of a young womanaccepting the adult role of a young Jewish woman.''</TEXT></DOC>
