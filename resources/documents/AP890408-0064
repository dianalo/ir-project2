She said five or six tanks pushed through the demonstrators indowntown Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, in a show of force on thefifth straight day of nationalists protests. She said the tanks didnot fire and the people refused to disperse, despite the presenceof several hundred soldiers.   Another activist said about 10 people were injured and that someprotesters threw themselves in front of a tank.   A journalist at the republic's official news agency, Gruzinform,said the republic's leadership was meeting urgently in governmentheadquarters that were surrounded by the protesters. He spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Forces of the Soviet Interior Ministry moved into Tbilisi onFriday after strikes and protests closed down much of the city.Witnesses reported seeing tanks and armored personnel carriers aswell soldiers, but official sources said they had no knowledge oftanks being deployed.   Nationalists have been demonstrating and conducting a hungerstrike to demand independence and an end to what they considerKremlin interference in their dealings with the Abkhazia region ofGeorgia. They barricaded themselves behind buses on Lenin Square infront of government offices to prevent government tanks and troopsfrom breaking up their protests, activists said.   In the first report on the unrest by the central press, thegovernment daily Izvestia did not mention calls for independencebut said ``anti-Soviet, anti-socialist'' slogans were seen at theTbilisi demonstrations.   The report said the main goal of the Tbilisi protest was toobject to unspecified ``unconstitutional actions'' by Abkhaziaresidents.   That appeared to be a reference to calls by Abkhazians to secedefrom Georgia and become a separate Soviet republic.   In addition to pressing their independence demands, the Georgianprotesters claim the Kremlin is stirring up ethnic unrest in theautonomous region of Abkhazia in their southern republic. Activistsreported clashes between Georgians and Abkhazians last weekend inthe Black Sea resort of Sukhumi.   Several people said unrest began in the region when thousands ofAbkhazians, a small minority, gathered in the settlement of Lichnitwo weeks ago to petition for Abkhazia to secede from Georgia andbecome a republic.   Ms. Chiza said in a telephone interview that most publictranportation was not operating in Tbilisi today, and other sourcessaid only stores and food processing plants were open. ``The wholecity is paralyzed,'' she said.   The crowd gathered in the square paralyzed traffic in the centerof the city of 1.2 million people.   Earlier today, activist Sergei Dandurov estimated the number oftanks at 10 and said they had injured eight or nine young people.He said in a telephone call from Tbilisi that several people threwthemselves at the first tank, shouting, ``Death to the Russianoccupiers!''   The unrest was the latest outpouring of nationalist feeling inthe Soviet Union, a country of more than 100 ethnic groups.Tensions have run particularly high in the southern Caucasus, whereGeorgia is located, because of earlier clashes between neighboringArmenians and Azerbaijanis.   Georgy Chanturia, chairman of the National Democratic Party,said Thursday that 158 Georgians began a hunger strike atgovernment buildings Tuesday and plan to continue it until April14, the anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978.He said they are demanding an independent Georgia.   Last fall, demonstrators marched in Tbilisi with demands rangingfrom Georgian independence to the manufacture of moreGeorgian-language typewriters.   Soviet authorities also responded to ethnic unrest inneighboring Azerbaijan and Armenia with troops in the past year.More than 90 people were killed in the ethnic clashes, mostly inNovember, and those two republics remained under military controland curfews for months.</TEXT></DOC>
