As part of an investigation into more than $14 million in possible overcharges for parts and labor, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations last week sealed a warehouse used by Northrop to store MX parts and interviewed employees at Northrop's MX assembly plant in Hawthorne, Calif., near Los Angeles.    The investigation is focusing on whether Northrop charged the Air Force twice for duplicate parts, inflated charges for other parts to cover up duplicate purchases, failed to test the parts as required, and billed the Air Force incorrectly for labor costs, according to persons familiar with the investigation. Duplicate parts allegedly were purchased because parts initially ordered weren't available as quickly as needed.    Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee plans to hold a hearing this week on the same issues. The committee plans to hear from Northrop employees who will testify, among other things, that the company discarded between 20,000 and 30,000 duplicate parts and set up outside companies to buy parts. Rep. Les Aspin, (D., Wis.), the committee chairman, has circulated a letter to committee members saying that the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles is investigating a Defense Department audit showing that 796 of 4,000 employee timecards for the MX project were altered, possibly resulting in overcharges of as much as $14 million.    A spokesman for Los Angeles-based Northrop said the defense contractor and the Air Force &quot;are examining (the audit) together to determine if there was any&quot; overcharging for labor costs. The U.S. Attorney's office couldn't be reached.    Northrop acknowledges setting up at least one outside firm, Liaison Engineering Services, to buy parts &quot;on the fast track&quot; because it was behind on deliveries, but the company said the practice was within Defense Department regulations. Purchasing parts through Northrop's procurement system would have taken longer because of bookkeeping and other requirements.    The Air Force has been withholding Northrop's $25 million monthly contract payments because Northrop is at least four months behind its delivery schedule for the guidance system and test equipment used in the nuclear-tipped, intercontinental ballistic missiles. One delay last summer was caused by the failure of certain Northrop employees to test a heat exchanger used in the guidance system. Northrop discovered the problem after the system failed during a test, conducted an internal investigation and disciplined the employees, the Northrop spokesman said. Northrop began production in 1985 of 52 guidance systems for the MX under a $339 million contract.    Rep. Aspin earlier claimed that Northrop's delays with the MX guidance system have forced the Air Force to slip behind on its schedule to place the missiles, which contain 10 nuclear warheads each, in underground silos in Wyoming to replace the aging Minuteman missiles. The Air Force has declined to comment. However, because of Northrop's delays, the Air Force last year chose Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Rockwell International Corp. as a second source for the guidance system.    The investigations began after David Peterson, a former Northrop manager of ground-equipment manufacturing support for the MX project, turned over to the House Energy and Commerce Committee last month 80 boxes of discarded parts he claims he retrieved from commercial dumpsters. Mr. Peterson told Air Force investigators that he retrieved only about one-tenth of the parts that were discarded, according to persons familiar with the investigation.    Mr. Peterson, who is scheduled to testify this week, was responsible for buying the parts as head of Liaison Engineering, which he says Northrop directed him to set up with $250,000 in company funds. Mr. Peterson claims his was one of seven separate parts-buying operations set up by Northrop to circumvent its procurement system.    A current Northrop employee who worked under Mr. Peterson is also scheduled to testify under subpoena. In an interview, the employee, who declined to be identified, blamed the parts problems on what the employee called a premature decision by Northrop to begin producing the MX guidance systems.    In a scramble to make up for lost time, Northrop managers waived required tests on the parts bought by Liaison Engineering because testing could take as many as three weeks, according to the employee and Mr. Peterson. &quot;I was told, 'Do what you gotta do to get the hardware in,'&quot; Mr. Peterson said.    The duplicate parts, which came through regular Northrop procurement channels after the other parts had already been used, were thrown out between September 1985 and January 1986 to prepare for an Air Force audit of the MX operation, according to the current Northrop employee.    The Northrop spokesman declined to comment on the allegations. </TEXT></DOC>
