<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0322 </DOCNO><TEXT>The nature of the vapor produced by pulse surface heating of UO{sub 2}and several other materials was investigated using normal-mode laserpulses with peak power densities between 10{sup 4} and 10{sup 6} W/cm{sup2}. Maximum surface temperatures measured by optical pyrometry rangedfrom 1900 to 4200 K. At temperatures below {similar_to}2400 K for UO{sub2}, the vapor pulse followed the Hertz--Langmiur vacuum vaporizationtheory. More energetic transients produced gasdynamic blowoffs accompaniedby significant supersaturation in the expanding plume. Neutron activationanalysis of the collected vapor indicated that the total quantity ofliquid UO{sub 2} evaporated in the pulse followed the Hertz--Langmuirformula. However, mass spectrometric analysis of the emitted vapor showedlarge deviations in the quantity and waveform shape of the monomer species.These and other features of the blowoff were satisfactorily explainedin terms of nucleation and growth of polymeric species. Although UO{sub2} clusters were undetectable by the mass spectrometer, polymers of MgOand ZrO{sub 2} were observed.</TEXT></DOC>
