The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustainedwinds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.   ``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director EugenioCabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.   Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closelyfollow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in theprovince, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 mileswest of Santo Domingo.   Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean andstrengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The NationalHurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday atlatitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south ofPonce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.   The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, saidGilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area ofcloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of thestorm.   The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.   Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastalflooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to PuertoRico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties.   San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gustsSaturday, but they subsided during the night.   On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropicalstorm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mphwinds and sheets of rain.   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic stormseason, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimalhurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast lastmonth.</TEXT></DOC>
