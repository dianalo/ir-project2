Comptroller Robert Clarke, the top regulator of federallychartered banks, made the disclosure in testimony before theHouse Small Business Committee. He wouldn't identify thegeographical areas.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Clarke said the comptroller's office planned to talkto bankers in the regions and &quot;might do targetedexaminations&quot; of real estate loans to determine howwidespread the problem is. Following targeted examinations inNew England, banks in the area set aside more than $2 billionfor potential losses. The comptroller's office has previouslysaid it is looking at real estate lending in the mid-Atlanticand Southeast regions.   Mr. Clarke said the newly identified problems were &quot;notcomparable&quot; in magnitude to the troubles in New England.   Testifying before the committee, Mr. Clarke and otherfederal banking regulators reiterated their belief that thereisn't a widespread credit crunch induced by tougher bankexaminations, as some business groups have charged.   While surveys have shown that banks are tightening creditstandards for small and medium-size businesses, the maincause isn't stricter regulation, said Federal Reserve Gov.John LaWare. &quot;Those banks that indicated they were takingsteps to tighten credit most often cited as reasons theirconcerns about the general economy or the prospects forparticular industries,&quot; he said.   Mr. LaWare also cited a recent survey by the NationalFederation of Independent Businesses which found &quot;lessborrowing by small firms, but supported the view that duringthe first quarter these firms had no unusual difficulty&quot;obtaining credit.   Statistics show a moderate drop-off in lending in NewEngland, particularly for real estate construction, butthat's a healthy reaction to the overbuilt markets, theregulators said. Mr. Clarke noted that office vacancy ratesin Boston increased to 14.6% in 1989 from 7% in 1983.   Though most committee members didn't criticize theregulators, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.) said he had heardfrom small-business people, contractors and banks. &quot;A curtainhas been dropped on some of the entrepreneurship we've seenin New England over the last decade,&quot; he said.   The regulators did agree that at least some banks havereacted to the tough regulation of the New England banks byreining in lending to credit-worthy borrowers. Paul Fritts,head of bank supervision at the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., said, &quot;A banker looks around and sees 700 or 800 bankfailures in the last few years and says, `I don't want thatto happen to me.'&quot;   It &quot;appears that some bankers have reduced their lendingto credit-worthy customers,&quot; Mr. Clarke said. &quot;We are takingsteps to encourage the bankers not to overreact.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
