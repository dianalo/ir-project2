ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. is in the finalstages of its record $24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.,having completed an epic tender offer for the food and tobacco giant.   Kohlberg Kravis said it was tendered more than 216.6 millionshares, or approximately 97.2 percent, of RJR Nabisco's outstandingcommon stock by the time its $109-per-share offer expired Thursday.   The investment firm is undertaking the largest U.S. corporateacquisition ever. The next largest would be the $13.4 billionpurchase of Gulf Oil Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.   As RJR Nabisco shares changed hands Thursday, so did control ofthe conglomerate, which makes such well-known products as Winstonand Camel cigarettes and Oreo cookies.   Company president F. Ross Johnson, defeated by Kohlberg Kravis inthe takeover fight, resigned as expected and was replaced by J. PaulSticht, a former chairman of RJR Industries Inc. RJR Industriesmerged with Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco.   Johnson left praising the people who beat him. ``I feel thecompany is in good hands,'' he said in a statement issued byKohlberg Kravis.   It was Johnson who instigated the bidding war for RJR Nabiscowith the announcement Oct. 20 that a management group he led was tenderednearly 1.2 millionshares, or approximately 95 percent, of RJR Nabisco's preferredstock. Those shares would be paid for on Friday, the firm said.   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis, said it was notimmediately known when the firm would complete the acquisitionbecause it must obtain federal approval for the new securitiesbefore it can close the deal.   After the acquisition is completed, Kohlberg Kravis must begin todivest several food lines to comply with an order from the FederalTrade Commission.   In clearing the RJR Nabisco purchase earlier this month, the FTCsaid Kohlberg Kravis must sell competing lines of oriental foods,packaged nuts and ketchup produced by either RJR or another KohlbergKravis unit, Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc.   Kohlberg Kravis will have a year to sell the product lines. Untilthe divestiture is completed, it must run RJR Nabisco as a separateoperation.   Kravis on Thursday reiterated his company's intention to sell $6billion in food businesses over the next 18 months to help financethe deal, which relies heavily on the use of high-interest junkbonds.   The purchase of RJR Nabisco is a leveraged buyout, in which acompany is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid withmoney raised by asset sales or the company's cash flow.   The size of the RJR Nabisco deal has prompted criticism of LBOsin general and a series of congressional hearings about whether theyshould be curtailed.</TEXT></DOC>
