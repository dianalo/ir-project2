ATandamp;T said the lasers are so tiny (about five microns indiameter) that at least 10,000 would fit on the head of apin. ATandamp;T and its rivals have been racing to boosttransmission power of fiber-optic communications equipmentand to miniaturize devices that comprise such gear to reducecost and make them easier to service.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a very novel semiconductor laser structure,&quot; saidErich Ippen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technologyprofessor who specializes in lasers and optics. &quot;The use ofhigh-density microscopic lasers as interconnects ispotentially quite important&quot; for linking information systemsin the future, he said.   ATandamp;T is looking at using &quot;these beautiful littlestructures&quot; as communications devices for optical switchesand connectors for linking computers and the devices withinthem, said Richart Slusher, chief of Bell Labs' OpticalPhysics Research department, Murray Hill, N.J. However, ATandamp;Tscientists must first show that the new devices can be madeas inexpensively as current electrical connectors and thatthey are compatible with silicon-based electronic equipment,he added.   Pictures supplied by ATandamp;T show the microscopic devices,dubbed &quot;microdisk lasers,&quot; look like thumbtacks when viewedthrough a scanning electron microscope. The head of each oneof these &quot;tacks&quot; is 400 atoms thick, or one-thousandth thediameter of a human hair. Dr. Slusher said the devices areBell Labs' &quot;biggest breakthrough&quot; since so-calledsurface-emitting lasers were developed about three years ago.Such lasers use two microscopic mirrors to concentrate alight beam on the laser chip's interior surface beforeshooting the beam in the form of a cone.   The new lasers were designed by Bell Labs' researcher SamMcCall to operate in the so-called &quot;whispering gallery&quot; mode,named for the sound effect associated with St. Paul'sCathedral in London, where a person can whisper and be heardclearly along the wall of the dome. In a similar fashion, Dr.McCall's lasers are said to shoot their light pulses orphotons along the edge of the disk-shaped laser, or the pathof least resistance, ATandamp;T said.   Each laser, which is crafted of indium gallium arsenide&quot;sandwiched&quot; between indium gallium arsenide phosphide, tookabout nine months to develop, said Dr. Slusher, who notedthat Dr. McCall worked on the team that developed ATandamp;T'ssurface-emitting devices.</TEXT></DOC>
