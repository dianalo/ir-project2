Authorities also picked up an off-duty American soldier and anAustralian tourist whose beards led authorities to mistake them forPalestinians. Both men were released after an identity check, theofficials said.   The roundups came Friday and Saturday after Philippine officialssaid they received a warning that Palestinians planned to bombClark Air Base and bars frequented by American servicemen duringthe weekend.   Police told reporters they received a report from the Israelisecret service Mossad that the bombings were to be carried out byat least eight Palestinians. But the U.S. and Israeli embassies inManila said they had no knowledge of such a warning.   Despite the stepped-up patrols of Philippine authorities, U.S.and Filipino troops guarding the sprawling U.S. base took nospecial security measures that were visible.   Officials at Clark could not be contacted for comment. But basespokesman Maj. Thomas Boyd appeared Saturday on the U.S. military'sFar East Network and warned the American military community to beon the alert for bomb attacks.   Boyd made no reference to a Palestinian threat, but he urgedservice members and families to be on the lookout for unattendedpackages in restaurants and other public places.   In October, American authorities stepped up security at Clark,Subic Naval Base and four smaller U.S. installations aftercommunist rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino near Clark.   Also Saturday, in Manila, 50 miles to south of Clark, U.S.Ambassador Nicholas Platt cautioned the Philippine governmentagainst ending the lease on U.S. military bases.   In a speech to American and Filipino war veterans, Platt asked,``Does the Philippines wish the United States to continue to sharethe burden of Philippine defense?''   Platt said that in exchange for the bases, the United Statesguarantees the Philippines' defense against external aggression. Hesaid the arrangement enables the 160,000-member Filipino army toconcentrate on fighting the country's 20-year communist insurgency.   U.S. and Philippine officials began early this month to reviewthe 1947 agreement under which the United States operates militarybases in the country. The lease expires in 1991.   In Angeles City, Filipino police and soldiers immediatelystepped up patrols after receiving the warning Thursday. Policechief Lt. Col. Orlando Macaspac said he had set up checkpoints toinspect vehicles entering the city. He said he had also postedoperatives at hotels, restaurants and bars.   Iraqi Kamil Shariff Babi and Iranian Ghesan Shooat Bakhsh, both32, were picked up on two buses from Manila which soldiers stoppedat a checkpoint Friday night, authorities said.   The two were detained because they could show no passports,according to Lt. Col. Victor Signey, chief of the PhilippineConstabulary's Angeles command. No charges had been filed againstthem.   Signey said he wanted to check a U.N. document Babi presentedsaying he was a political refugee. Babi told police he lived inAngeles with his American wife and two children.   Bakhsh said he was a medical student at a university in DagupanCity farther north and that his passport had been confiscated byimmigration authorities in the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
