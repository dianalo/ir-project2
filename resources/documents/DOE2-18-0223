This system was installed on a chemelectrictreater to monitor five end devices and to determine the feasibilityof using fiber optics rather than pneumatics or an electrical systemin a harsh environment. Included with a performance summary is a briefhistory of optical fiber and the potential for these types of safetysystems in oilfield applications.</TEXT></DOC>
