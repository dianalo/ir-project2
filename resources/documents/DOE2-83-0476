However, it commonly varies to some degree with host-rock lithology,which can diminish its reliability as a paleothermometer. The Pennsylvanian-ageNarragansett Basin contains argillaceous rocks and impure coals thatreflect a wide range of thermal conditions (deep-burial diagenetic tostaurolite grade) though over 3/4 of the area is underlain by sub-metamorphicrocks, as measured from coal rank and authigenic illite. Extensive usewas made of cored coal-bearing sections that had been thermally alteredin either diagenetic, lower anchizone (sub-chlorite) and upper anchizone(sub-biotite) realms in order to characterize the range of variabilityfound at different argillaceous and bituminous horizons within each section.Ranges of illite crystallinity within individual cores vary inverselywith grade but high variability is particularly characteristic of thediagenetic regime. Correlations to coal-rank parameters suggest thatthe most reliable illite geothermometers at this grade are found in low-organicmudstones that are not in close association with coal horizons. Illitefrom impure coals/bituminous shales have the lowest crystallinities underdiagenitic conditions but such differences are minimal once anchimetamorphicconditions are attained. High octahedral Al/Fe+Mg and interlayer K appearto favor increased crystallinity at all sub-metamorphic levels.</TEXT></DOC>
