We see the shorter wavelengths asblue and the longer ones as red.andP;  In between lie all the colors of therainbow.andP;  Different mixtures of light at different wavelengths yield oodlesof additional hues.andM;You probably know by now that the eye constructs the sensation of color fromthree kinds of sensors.andP;  One kind is most sensitive to red light, another togreen, and a third to blue.andP;  (Discrimination between red and green is arecent evolutionary invention.andP;  A small genetic hiccup leads to the commonestform of colorblindness, a failure to distinguish red and green.)andM;For a person with normal color vision, all mixtures of wavelengths thatstimulate the three sensors appear the same color.andP;  That means you canreproduce nearly all colors by mixing three light sources that address theeye's sensors independently.andP;  (Life is never quite that simple, but I don'twant to get any more detailed right now.) Press your nose against a color TVscreen while the set is on.andP;  You will see the red, green, and blue dots thatmake up the image.andP;  Even better, watch the stage lights the next time you'rein a theater.andP;  I'm continually amazed to see red and green lights combine toproduce Yellow, with no sensation of either primary color.andM;Red, green, and blue are the colors you use when mixing lights.andP;  They arecalled the additive primaries.andP;  When you mix pigments to produce coloredinks, however, you need a different set of primaries.andP;  Press your noseagainst the Sunday comics and you will see the three colors.andM;Your kindergarten teacher probably taught you that these subtractiveprimaries are red, yellow, and blue.andP;  Your kindergarten teacher was wrong.andO;That alleged red is really magenta, a mixture of red and blue.andP;  You can alsothink of it as the absence of green.andP;  The alleged blue is really cyan, amixture of green and blue.andP;  You can think of it as the absence of red.andO;Yellow is correct, a mixture of red and green.andP;  It is also the absence ofblue.andM;In principle, you can mix varying quantities of cyan, yellow, and magentapigments to make an arbitrary color.andP;  In practice, it's hard to produce thefull range of grays possible with black ink and gray-scale reproduction.andO;(Last month I observed that glossy paper can capture eight zones or densitydoublings.) The blacks just aren't as black as you'd like.andP;  Printers solvethis problem by adding black ink to the soup.andP;  Equal quantities of cyan,yellow, and magenta are effectively replaced with the proper measure ofblack, to good effect.andP;  That's why printers talk about four-colorreproduction, even though our eyes work on only three primaries.andM;Color displays have been with us for some time.andP;  We have the technology oftelevision to thank for that.andP;  But color TVs to generally lack the snap andsharpness of gray-scale displays, and they cost considerably more.andP;  That'sbecause they need to stuff three color dots into each pixel.andP;  However,resolution and cost are improving quit  e rapidly.andM;Also important is the number of distinct hues a display can represent.andP;  Themore hues, the more bits you need for each pixel.andP;  At 300,000 pixels forconventional VGA, eight bits per pixel takes nearly a third of a millionbytes.andP;  And that gives you just 256 distinct colors.andP;  Cost and writing timeboth go up as you increase the number of distinct hues.andM;One popular trick lets you dramatically increase the number of distinctcolors you can display without a corresponding increase in bits per pixel.andO;Each display is accompanied by a palette that maps the code stored in eachpixel to the color you wish to display.andP;  At eight bits per pixel, you need a256-entry palette.andP;  If each entry contains a 16bit number, you can display65,536 distinct colors.andP;  You just can't display all those colors at once.andO;Instead, you choose which subset of 256 does the job well enough for eachpicture.andP;  That's what you store in the palette.andM;But let's say you're not in the mood to compromise.andP;  How many bits do youhave to store in each pixel to represent all the colors your eye candistinguish? Last month, I concluded that 256 shades of gray are probablysufficient if you don't care about color.andP;  It helps if you can also map codevalues to shades of gray by some nonlinear scale.andP;  (The human eye respondslogarithmically to light intensity.)andM;It makes sense, then, that 256 shades of each primary should do a good job ofcovering all the colors the eye can distinguish.andP;  And indeed, that seems tobe the case.andP;  The eye is noticeably less sensitive to changes in blue shadesthan to changes in red and green.andP;  (Blue vision seems to have evolved earlierand is more primitive in several ways.) You might cut corners here.andP;  Youmight also cut corners in the almost-black or almost-white regions.andP;  The eyeis fussiest about color near the middle grays.andM;People have tried a variety of encodings with these thoughts in mind.andP;  Some16-bit encodings give good coverage, in part by short-changing the blues.andO;The simplest brute-force approach is simply to allocate eight bits to each ofthe three primaries.andP;  That yields the 24-bit color you hear more about everyday.andP;  Adding to the confusion, some people set aside 32 bits per pixel.andP;  Theadditional eight bits don't participate in the color information.andP;  They justhelp round the storage size up to four bytes, a size beloved of much computerhardware..andM;Today you can buy scanners and displays that support 24-bit (or 32-bit)color.andP;  That's wonderful, except that displays still need better spatialresolution.andP;  Color printers have the spatial resolution but typically lackthe color resolution.andP;  I will be happy only when the norm for scanners,displays, and printers uniformly meets the demands of human vision.andP;  Thatmeans 100 dots per degree and 24 bits of color information per dot.andM;Now let's talk a bit about image size.andP;  The conventional output device thesedays is the page printer.andP;  In the U.S., the standard page size for letterheadis 8 1/2 by 11 inches.andP;  The rest of the nominally civilized world uses themetric standard A4, a little skinnier and a little longer than the Americanpage.andP;  The differences are just enough to drive you up the wall if you haveto reproduce a mixed bag of correspondence from around the world.andP;  (Sorry, Ipromised not to gripe about my problems with standards activities forawhile.)andM;Naturally, other paper sizes are widely used as well.andP;  U.S.andP;  lawyers insiston a slightly longer &quot;legalsize&quot; page.andP;  Some applications need the larger 1 1-by- 1 4-inch page.andP;  The metric world has its A5, B4, and so on.andP;  At leastthese tend to be even multiples or divisions of each other.andP;  For now,however, I confine my attention to standard letterhead pages.andM;When I discussed resolution last month, I was careful to distinguish spatialand angular resolution.andP;  Spatial resolution is about how many dots per inchyou use to construct an image.andP;  Angular resolution is about how many dots perangular degree you see, regardless of viewing distance.andP;  The same spatialresolution can yield quite different angular resolutions under differentviewing conditions.andP;  Angular resolution is what your eye cares about.andM;The same is true of image size.andP;  Words typed in 12-point Courier on a sheetof letterhead are easily read at arm's length.andP;  Post the same sheet near thetop of a bulletin board and you'd better make the type larger.andP;  The largerpoint size regains the angular resolution you need to make the words legible.andO;But now you can write fewer words per page.andP;  Nail that same sheet to atelephone pole across the street and you can convey even less information.andO;Anything more detailed than a single peace sign or smiley face will gounrecognized.andM;What's changing here along with angular resolution is called solid angle.andP;  Itis a measure of field of view that is independent of viewing distance.andO;Imagine yourself suspended inside a sphere with a one-mile radius.andP;  Bylooking in all directions, you can see the entire inner surface of thatsphere.andP;  The area of the sphere is four ir square miles.andP;  Saw the sphere inhalf and each part has an area of two [pi] square miles.andP;  In fact, any fieldof view you can delimit can be projected on the spherical surface.andP;  Theprojected area in square miles is a measure of the solid angle of the fieldof view.andM;Of course, the sphere on which you project the field of view can be any size.andO;just divide the projected area on the sphere by the square of the radius ofthe sphere.andP;  You will obtain a dimensionless number between zero and four[pi].andP;  People nevertheless ascribe a unit of measure to this dimensionlessnumber.andP;  It is called the &quot;steradian.&quot; I will present all solid angles inunits 1/1,000 as large, or millisteradians (msr).andM;Now let's get back to our sheet of letterhead.andP;  Held at arm's length, itsubtends a solid angle of about 300 msr.andP;  Double the viewing distance and itsubtends only one quarter as much, or about 75msr.andP;  Ten times the viewingdistance yields 1% of the original solid angle, or 3msr.andP;  As you can see, youlose a lot of viewing angle if you have to step back.andM;The problem with current interactive displays is just the opposite.andP;  They'renot big enough.andP;  The VGA display on my Compaq SLT/286 is rather nice, andit's pretty much state of the art.andP;  At normal viewing distance, it subtendsabout 15msr, or about half a sheet of letterhead.andP;  That's fine for many uses,but it's maddening when I compose page images with Ventura Publisher or CorelDraw.andP;  I feel like I'm looking at the world through the porthole of a ship.andM;Then I see ads for various windowing environments.andP;  Invariably, they show astandard terminal screen decorated with a half dozen or more imagesoverlapped in various ways.andP;  We are supposed to feel reassured by thisclutter because it follows the infamous &quot;desktop metaphor.andP;  &quot; just as we pushbits of paper about on our work desks, we can manage our computer-hosted workthe same way.andP;  No need to learn any scary new ways of doing business.andM;The multiple images are supposed to convince us we can share informationbetween any number of applications that are active simultaneously.andP;  They giveme a headache.andP;  I already have eye strain from peering through the porthole.andO;Why should I obscure the limited view with an assortment of sticky yellownotes?andM;Fred Brooks of The Mythical ManMonth fame puts it even better.andP;  He says thedesktop metaphor is misleading; it should be called an &quot;airplane scat&quot;metaphor.andP;  You are sitting in one of those horrid middle seats in coachclass.andP;  A large person is seated on either side of you.andP;  You are trying toorganize your work on that tiny little tray table in front of you.andP;  You haveno elbow room and no place to put extra papers, except possibly your shirtpocket.andP;  I've worked that way more times than I care to count, but it is notmy favorite environment.andM;My idea of a desktop environment is far more ambitious.andP;  I have triedfull-page displays and find them little better than conventional ones.andP;  Atypical desktop has room for a dozen sheets of letterhead, without overlap.andO;You can tolerate even more clutter, with overlapping piles, for short periodswhile you organize papers.andP;  If you want to sell me on the desktop metaphor,give me a display as big as a desktop.andP;  That means a viewing angle of of atleast 2,000msr.andP;  And give me 100-dots-per-degree resolution over the entireview with 256 shades of gray at every pixel.andP;  (Even better, give me 24-bitcolor.) Oh yes-keep it cheap, please.andM;Actually, I'm even more demanding than that.andP;  I attended an engineeringpreparatory high school in Baltimore, Md.andP;  There I learned to love draftingtables.andP;  I like to really sprawl when I work.andP;  My study desk through collegewas a drafting table, and I still have one or two kicking around the house.andO;My idea of a CAD/CAM station is a drafting table with an active surface.andP;  Nowwe're talking around 4,500msr.andM;Some people are beginning to experiment with artificial realities.andP;  A (veryhot) computer generates everything your eyes see and everything your earshear.andP;  You manipulate this world through gloves that sense your hand motionsand offer believable resistance to those motions.andP;  Artificial realities makemany demands on the human interface.andP;  Some I will eventually discuss further.andO;For now, I simply observe that each eye must be presented with an image thatsubtends over 6,000msr.andM;If it's any consolation to hardware designers, my ambitions have limits.andP;  Asolid angle of 12,500msr is an acceptable upper bound.andP;  That controlseverything you see in all directions, except for a small hole for theprojector lens.andP;  I'll settle for that.andM;One special demand of artificial realities is to produce realisticthree-dimensional images.andP;  The challenge is to produce two distinct imagesand present them independently to different eyes.andP;  Where the eyes must focusprovides depth information out to about 20 feet.andP;  Small differences in theperspective of the two images provide additional depth cues, particularly fordistant objects.andM;If you can slap goggles on the observer, you have the easiest solution.andP;  Asmall imaging device can subtend a large solid angle.andP;  Clever optics canproduce images at a variety of perceived distances.andP;  And it is easy to keepthe signals for the two eyes separate.andP;  The problem is that even the wispiestof goggles can annoy.andP;  I assure you that current technology requires gogglesthat are a long way from wispy.andM;One way to keep the goggles wispy is to separate the imaging function.andP;  Dothe hard work out front on a screen or some other active device.andP;  Leave thegoggles the lesser job of keeping the images separate.andP;  The earliestthree-dimensional movies achieved this noble goal with red and greencellophane filters in cardboard frames.andP;  They sorted out red and greenmonochrome images projected onto the same screen.andP;  Photographs of audiencesfrom that era are often more entertaining than the movies they watched.andM;A later improvement supported color.andP;  The filters are neutral gray polarizersaligned at right angles to each other.andP;  They separate the two imagesprojected with appropriately polarized light sources.andP;  As far as I know, thatremains the most inexpensive approach that can be considered at all adequate.andO;Holograms and xenon mists&quot; are still the stuff of science fiction.andP;  As forme, I am willing to wait a bit longer for three-dimensional displays tobecome commonplace.andM;I  am less willing to wait for animation.andP;  By that term, I mean movingdisplays in general.andP;  My living desktop should be able to display a fewTV-quality pictures of various sizes.andP;  Some can be from broadcasts, some froma large on-line data store.andP;  (I won't bother restricting the store to a VCRor optical disk.)andM;The desktop should also be able to compute and display graphs evolving inreal time.andP;  I want to unleash subatomic particles in various potential fieldsand watch the probability waves slosh back and forth.andP;  And it should let mestoryboard a presentation and interpolate the intermediate frames of action.andO;(Cartoonists call this &quot;tweening,&quot; a process often still performed byplatoons of &quot;in-betweeners.&quot;)andM;If the display goes dark after it shows each frame of animation, it hadbetter show the next one soon.andP;  Otherwise, you get perceptible and annoyingflicker.andP;  Countries that favor 50Hz power also tend to favor TVs with 50Hzrefresh rates.andP;  To me, they are just one more source of headaches in aheadacheogenic world.andP;  I feel 60Hz is a better minimum refresh rate.andP;  Somefolks consider 100Hz a more tolerable minimum.andM;One trick for lowering flicker is to increase the persistence of each image.andO;With phosphors painted by flying electron beams, you must strike a delicatebalance.andP;  If persistence is too long, it blurs motion and smears scenechanges.andP;  Of course, a display that doesn't fade between frames has fewerproblems in this area.andM;One remaining problem is simulating smooth motion.andP;  (This is not the same aseliminating flicker.) The 60Hz scan of American TV actually offers only 30new frames of information per second.andP;  If the broadcast source is a movie,the rate drops to 24 distinct frames per second.andP;  (Some get shown twice.)andO;That seems to be enough to do the job.andM;I suspect I've lost most of the pragmatists among you by now.andP;  Asking for anactive display with 300 DPI is pretty ambitious.andM;Insisting that each of those dots display any of 16 million different colorssends the cost way up.andP;  Demanding a one-square-yard active area makes thecost outrageous.andP;  Requesting that the display be refreshed 60 times persecond simply puts the icing on a very expensive cake.andM;For memory, I'm talking 100 million pixels, each with three bytes of colorinformation.andP;  That's 300MB just for the active screen memory.andP;  Refresh it at60Hz and you need to process 1.8 gigabytes per second.andP;  Some people wouldconsider that a serious data processing load.andM;I can only observe that display demands have been soaring all along.andP;  Twentyyears ago, 10 bytes per second was all you could stuff into a Model 33Teletype.andP;  Ten years ago, you were happy to get 1,000 bytes per second.andO;Today, 100,000 bytes per second is not an-uncommon display load.andP;  I'll betthose 1.8 gigabytes have lots of redundancy.andP;  Specialized processors willhandle most of them as a matter of course.andP;  We can probably get away with atraffic of a &quot;mere&quot; 10MB per second.andP;  That keeps us closer to the exponentialgrowth curve.andM;The main point is that we really do need displays like this.andP;  Many of youwon't believe that until you see them, but i'm absolutely convinced they'revital.andP;  Human vision is such a vital communication channel that we need tomake full use of it when we interact with computers.andM;Of course, the other four senses are also important.andP;  And I still haven'ttalked about them.andM;P.J.andP;  Plauger has been a writer of textbooks, a prolific programmer, and asoftware entrepreneur He has- been active in the development of standards,most notably for the C programming language.andP;  His most recent book isStandard C, coauthored by Jim Brody.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
