These data will be used toobtain improved values for opacities in stellar envelopes, and shouldalso be of interest for other problems in physics and astronomy. Thepresent paper, which is the first in a series, gives some of the formulaefrom thermodynamics and atomic physics which are required for opacitycalculations.</TEXT></DOC>
