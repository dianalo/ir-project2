New technologies in fishery andthe indispensable relationship with energy were investigated. In manycases, cost of energy has restriced the rapid increase in productionfrom the cultivated fishery. The utilization of hot springs and otherheat resources in the surrounding area is very promising. In addition,utilization of solar heat and wind power, use of hot drainage from powerplants and the like, etc. have also been investigated. Securing energyon the sea is indispensable for the MARINE RANCH TECHNOLOGY. Solar cellsare used for automatic feeding device and linking sound devices, wirelesstelemeter equipment, etc. Monitoring buoys for the observation of fisheryground status and other devices used at the FLOATING GATHERING PLACEFOR FISH require compact and economic energy (mostly electric power source)equipment. Brief description was made also for the use of deep water.(1 photo)</TEXT></DOC>
