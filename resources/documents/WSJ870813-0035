StevensStaff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar eased against most major currencies in moderate foreign exchange trading Wednesday as traders trimmed positions in anticipation of tomorrow's report on U.S. merchandise trade for June.    Economists generally expect the Commerce Department to report that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to around $13 billion in June from $14.4 billion in May. But some estimates call for a widening of the gap. Yesterday's dollar selling represented uncertainty about what the actual figure will be, as well as profit-taking on the U.S. currency's recent rise, traders said.    &quot;The key is going to be the trade number. The guys who haven't jumped into dollars yet are going to decide on the trade numbers as to whether this up trend is a correct move,&quot; said Frank J. Conte, vice president for foreign exchange at Barclays Bank PLC's New York office.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8899 West German marks, off from 1.8942 Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 1.5710 Swiss francs from 1.5740, but nosed higher to 151.18 Japanese yen, from 151.14. The British pound climbed to $1.5792, from $1.5728.    The dollar's pullback yesterday came after the U.S. currency Tuesday briefly surpassed the 1.90-mark level for the first time since the second week of January. That also represented the high-point for the U.S. unit since it began climbing on increased tensions in the Middle East resulting from the U.S. flagging and Navy escort of Kuwaiti tankers operating in the Persian Gulf. The dollar also has been helped by indications of healthier economic growth in the U.S. compared with major trading partners.    Mideast tensions continue to be a supportive factor for the dollar, as many market participants hold dollars as a hedge against any catastrophic impact on world economies because of a broader Persian Gulf conflict. By one estimate, the dollar would be valued at 1.80 marks in the absence of these tensions.    But traders question whether the market has exhausted Mideast developments as a bullish factor for the dollar.    The market barely reacted to a rumor yesterday, which was soon denied, of a coup in Iran replacing the Islamic government. &quot;I don't think the rumor was taken seriously enough, or lasted long enough, to have an impact,&quot; said Leslie A. Puth, a trader at Banque Indosuez, New York.    But also, &quot;traders were confused just which way it (a coup) would influence the dollar,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president of foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    Barclay's Mr. Conte added that &quot;people didn't know . . . whether it was good or bad for the dollar.&quot; He said if a new Iranian government resulted in reduced tensions, then the dollar might be expected to drop back. &quot;On the other hand, it should help the dollar if it might improve relations with Iran,&quot; he said.    In Tokyo yesterday, a high-ranking Bank of Japan source said that recent foreign exchange movements have been within a &quot;relatively stable&quot; range and that recent central bank intervention is intended to &quot;smooth&quot; the dollar's rise against the mark.    Intervention to sell dollars against the mark, which has been carried out in recent sessions by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank, is a &quot;smoothing operation to fizzle speculative moves against the mark,&quot; the source said. He declined to comment, however, on the Bank of Japan's stance regarding the possibility of its own intervention.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 151.20 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1 an ounce to $463.20 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.05 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, Aug. 12, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
