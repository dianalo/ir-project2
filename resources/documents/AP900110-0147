Part of President Bush's justification for the Dec. 20 invasionof Panama was the U.S. contention that elections there last Maywere stolen by now-deposed ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega. U.S.troops installed President Guillermo Endara, who independentobservers had said was the winner of that election.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Wednesday that ``thereare no plans to invade Nicaragua,'' despite a suggestion by SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole that Managua should look carefully at whathappened in Panama.   Nicaragua has elections scheduled for Feb. 25. Bushadministration officials have been critical of the preparations,accusing the Sandinista government of harassing and stacking theelection deck against the opposition.   In addition, Popadiuk said it was ``troublesome'' that some ofthe $9 million the United States has sent to assist the Nicaraguanopposition has been held up in banking bureaucracy and red tape.   Dole said last week that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega andCuban President Fidel Castro perhaps would ``get the message thatpeople will only be oppressed for so long, whether it's in EasternEurope or Central America or wherever.''   ``I think Ortega will understand now that it's probably in hisinterest to have free and fair elections in February,'' Dole said.   Asked about Dole's comments, Popadiuk said, ``There is anelection process under way. We expect free and fair elections totake place.''   However, he added, ``We've noticed that the Nicaraguans havebeen harassing the opposition to a great extent, all of which iscounterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly.This is something that troubles us.''   Bush has stated that the circumstances of Nicaragua are muchdifferent from Panama, where Noriega was wanted on a U.S. drugtrafficking indictment and where the United States had substantialPanama Canal-related interests.   Regarding impediments to the flow of the U.S. electoral aid,State Department officials said Wednesday there were indicationsthe obstacles were being removed, and the money would be receivedby the civic election monitoring group IPCE.   Later, however, another official said although Nicaraguan VicePresident Sergio Ramirez promised to eliminate the problems, IPCEofficials were told Wednesday they still were not properlyregistered in Nicaragua and it would take six months to file thepaperwork.   The $1.5 million designated by the United States for IPCE _ theletters represent a Spanish acronym _ had been held up since earlyDecember, one source said.   Further delay in releasing the money will be seen as adeliberate roadblock by Managua, rather than just red tape, saidone official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The political opposition party UNO, for National OppositionUnion, when unable to have its funds wired to the Central Bankultimately began purchasing vehicles and materials it needed andarranging for the vendors to be paid from foreign banks, said theofficial.   Bush telephoned UNO`s presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro onWednesday to inquire about her health and discuss the election,Popadiuk said. She is being treated in Houston for a knee ailment,he said.   Congress approved the $9 million in electoral aid to beadministered through the quasi-governmental National Endowment forDemocracy. IPCE is to spend its $1.5 million for such activities assupporting poll watchers and checking voter registration lists.   UNO was to receive $1.8 million for such political activity asvoter registration and organization. Under Nicaraguan election law,50 percent of any foreign contribution to the election processwould must go to the country's Supreme Electoral Council, therebyalso benefiting the government.   The rest of the funds were designated for other observer groupsand to administrative and auditing costs, including those of theNational Endowment and the State Department's Agency forInternational Development.</TEXT></DOC>
