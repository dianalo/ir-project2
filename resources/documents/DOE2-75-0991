Research was initiated in three distinct climate zones(humid, arid, and arctic) during various times within the project period.The REFLEX experiments are being conducted within different climates/ecologiczones in an effort to explore the limits and benefits of advanced remotesensing technology. Research on disturbed watersheds in humid climatesexplores and identifies the fundamental hydrologic and sediment transportrelationships in the temporal evolution of the hydrologic cycle on disturbedwatersheds. Characterization of runoff properties of disturbed watershedsachieves greater than 70 percent classification accuracy with high resolution,digital SPOT data. Research on disturbed watersheds in arid regions addressesthe problem of remotely sensed data as input to hydrologic models. Itexplores the utility of high resolution satellite data and registered,multiple data layers as input to hydrologic models. This research produceda significant advancement in automated delineation and extraction ofdrainage networks, watershed divides, and contributing areas from digitalelevation databases. 33 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
