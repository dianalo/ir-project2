And as the candidate makes his way to the stage outside this Brittany city, the 15,000-strong crowd begins the rhythmic chant, &quot;Mitterrand, Mitterrand.&quot;    Francois Mitterrand, who has held various elective offices since 1946, is hoping for one more term as president. With the first round of presidential elections less than two weeks away, the 71-year-old Mr. Mitterrand came here Friday to hold the first of only four scheduled meetings and explain his &quot;project for France.&quot; But as his nearly two-hour, largely improvised speech showed, this project is a far cry from the one he proposed seven years ago. Gone is his talk of &quot;a rupture with capitalism,&quot; of nationalizing industries and banks, of vast social changes, of hiring civil servants -- in short, of socialism.    Mr. Mitterrand's message this time is &quot;uniting France&quot; around a platform that aims to combine the market economy with social justice, eschewing the dogmatism of both the Socialists and free-market &quot;liberals&quot; that have governed since 1986 under Prime Minister Jacques Chirac.    Though the re-election campaign began two weeks ago with a hard-hitting attack against the right, particularly Mr. Chirac, the Rennes meeting gave the first clear indication that Mr. Mitterrand's campaign will portray him as a moderate, above the fray and seeking to lead France along a social-democratic path.    &quot;It's the opposite of 1981,&quot; says political analyst Alain Duhamel, who is close to the moderate right. &quot;He has drawn the lessons of his seven years in power, is distancing himself from his party and is preparing for an opening to the center.&quot;    &quot;French society is a mixed economy,&quot; Mr. Mitterrand told the crowd, composed largely of local Socialist stalwarts. &quot;They are mistaken who think they should rely on the state for everything, they are mistaken who think the state should do nothing. We do not want to shoot down the other camp. We want France to unite.    &quot;France will only be united if it's a France on the move, that creates, that invents, that produces. France will only be united if it chooses to be just, to cast aside privileges, to refuse exclusion, to hit at injustice and attack social inequalities.&quot;    To show that he hasn't abandoned the left, Mr. Mitterrand devoted his speech to themes dear to a Socialist audience. On foreign policy, he spoke of the need to build Europe, of support for balanced nuclear and conventional disarmament, of the urgency of aiding the Third World.    On domestic policy, he said France must fight poverty and racism, defended the social security system and denounced plans to privatize certain health services.    But he didn't mention significant changes in economic policy from that of the current right-wing government, although he has said he would neither renationalize companies nor pursue the current privatization program. Mr. Mitterrand only mentioned the word &quot;socialist&quot; once -- and that was to say that his plan to reinstate a wealth tax to fund the fight against poverty &quot;isn't a socialist measure.&quot;    Partly, analysts say, this reflects basic agreement between the left and the right on main issues, including economic policy. &quot;Once Mitterrand says he's for Europe, he's for the market economy,&quot; says one of his aides. &quot;Economic policy isn't an issue in these elections.&quot;    But analysts say Mr. Mitterrand's moderate stance is also dictated by tactics. Polls show he would beat either of his conservative rivals, Mr. Chirac and former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, if a second round of voting is needed, as expected. (His rival in the decisive second round, scheduled for May 8, is likely to be Mr. Chirac.) But to win, Mr. Mitterrand needs support from the moderate electorate.    If he wins, Mr. Mitterrand also will need support from the right to implement his program. He faces an opposition that has a slim parliamentary majority. But Mr. Mitterrand has said he wouldn't dissolve parliament and call new elections unless it voted down his government.    To prevent this, Mr. Mitterrand must win the support of some centrists. &quot;His program contains symbolic measures for the left, like the wealth tax and an emphasis on social justice, but its content is deliberately ecumenical,&quot; says Mr. Duhamel, the analyst. Opinion polls show that Mr. Mitterrand has a chance of succeeding in wooing the right: A poll published in the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur found that 55% of the French favor participation by the right in a Socialist-led government.    &quot;He will try to make openings to the center,&quot; Mr. Duhamel predicts. &quot;It isn't certain they'll be accepted at first or that those who come to him will be very representative. But he'll name a government led by a moderate Socialist that will submit bills that the centrists can accept. Then, after the centrists have voted with them for a while, the Socialists will make new proposals for an alliance.&quot;    During his speech Friday, Mr. Mitterrand made obvious overtures to the center-right. &quot;There are some excellent people in the current majority,&quot; he said. The crowd booed. &quot;Believe me,&quot; he pursued. &quot;I see them sometimes.&quot; The crowd booed again. &quot;Don't get carried away,&quot; he said. &quot;We aren't the good ones and they the bad ones.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
