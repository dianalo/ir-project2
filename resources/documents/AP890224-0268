(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire saidFriday it will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash tosettle a securities-fraud lawsuit.   The suit against the company and top executives was brought morethan a year ago by holders of company stock warrants and bonds thathelped pay for completion of the idle Seabrook nuclear power plant.   D. Pierre Cameron Jr., chief counsel for Public Service, saidless than $1 million in cash would be paid to two New Yorksecurities firms that filed the suit. He said the company'sliability insurance and executive indemnification rights would coverthe payments.   The case was set for trial next month in federal court in NewYork City before the settlement was announced Thursday.   The settlement must be approved by the federal judge handling thecase in New York and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing PublicService's bankruptcy reorganization.   ``The company and the officers and directors have denied andcontinue to deny any wrongdoing, but they have entered into thesettlement to avoid further inconvenience, disruption, delay,expense and the uncertainty of further litigation,'' Public Servicesaid in a statement.   The lawsuit was filed by Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg and ElliottAssociates L.P. about a month before Public Service soughtbankruptcy protection in January 1988.   It centered on the utility's June 1986 suspension of warrants forpurchasing Public Service common stock. The warrants were due toexpire in October 1991.   The firms charged that Public Service tried to mislead investorsand stall attempts to seek relief by failing to give adequate noticeit had suspended the warrants.   In a statement Thursday, Public Service said the settlement wouldinclude a new bond-for-stock exchange.   Public Service suspended the warrants as its finances worsenedbecause of licensing delays for Seabrook, utility spokesman NicholasAshooh said. Public Service owns 36 percent of the project, whichwas completed in July 1986 but remains unlicensed because ofemergency-planning and financial problems.   Public Service issued more than 18 million of the warrants alongwith $425 million in 17{ percent debentures in December 1984. Thefinancing, a utility industry record, let Public Service pull backfrom the brink of bankruptcy and finish Seabrook.   Warrant holders were able to exchange each one for a share ofcommon stock by paying $5 cash or turning in debentures with a $5face value. The warrants are traded on the Pacific Stock Exchange,the debentures and common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.   The New York firms said they were unaware the warrants had beensuspended when they bought the warrants and debentures in 1987. Thefirms alleged Public Service failed to disclose the suspension in1987 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   If the settlement wins approval, warrant holders could exchangelots of 200 warrants and $1,000 worth of debentures for lots of 200shares of common stock, the utility said.</TEXT></DOC>
