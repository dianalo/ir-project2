Baker III ofIsrael's policy of continuing to support new Jewish settlements inthe occupied lands.   ``Now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, theunrealistic vision of a greater Israel,'' Baker said in a speech inWashington on Monday.   Shamir, interviewed by Israel radio, said, ``I don't know howanyone could speak at all of a large Israel. Israel is a very smallcountry and all of us know that its territory is very limited. Itreally rings ironic to speak of Israel as big.''   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens also dismissed Baker's call onIsrael to halt Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip and give up aspirations of annexing the territories.   ``These are our dreams. We are speaking about our country and wehave proven that we fulfill our dreams,'' Arens said on the radio,interviewed from Brussels.   Shamir, who was on a visit to London, said of his disagreementwith Baker over Jewish settlements in the territories: ``It isclear there are differences of opinion between us and that isn'tnew. I don't see any link between settlements and the subject ofthe peace process.''   He added that he had explained his views on the settlements``fully and explicitly'' when he visited Washington last month.   Israel has built more than 130 settlements in the occupiedterritories since capturing them in the 1967 Middle East War.Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc considers these lands to be integralparts of historic Israel.   About 70,000 Jews live in the settlements, which are scatteredamong Arab towns, villages and refugee camps whose populationtotals 1.7 million.   The United States has long criticized Jewish settlement buildingin these territories as an obstacle to peace. But Baker's commentsin a speech to an American Jewish lobby group on Monday were seenas one of the sharpest American statements on the issue.   Baker urged Israel to ``foreswear annexation. Stop settlementactivity. Allow schools to reopen,'' referring to Palestinianschools shut by Israel in the West Bank and Gaza as part of acrackdown on a 17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israelirule.   Israeli newspapers headlined Baker's criticism of Israel, givinglittle attention to his calls to Palestinians to be moreconciliatory toward Israel and to abandon ``the illusion of controlover all of Palestine.''   The Haaretz daily quoted unnamed diplomats in Washington assaying they found Baker's speech to be ``very disappointing fromIsrael's standpoint.'' The newspaper also said the speech was oneof the ``worst'' for Israel made by an American leader in the lastdecade.</TEXT></DOC>
