CT densitometryis a non-invasive procedure which may be used without modification toassess lung damage in experimental animals and in man. An increase inthe breathing rate is seen following irradiation of the thorax, the timeof onset and severity of which are dose dependent and correlate withhistopathological changes occurring at the same time. Lung density changesoccurring after irradiation are more complex. For the lowest dose used(10.75 Gy) no density increase was observed and in fact density decreasedwith time after irradiation to a slightly greater extent than in non-irradiatedcontrols. A post-irradiation increase in lung density was seen for ratsgiven 13.0 Gy, but values fluctuated with maxima at 50 and 225 days afterirradiation. Higher radiation doses (14.5, 16.0 Gy) were followed bya transient decrease in density before a dose-related density increasewas observed. Density averaged over the whole lung proved to be a sub-optimalindex of radiation-induced lung damage because of the focal nature ofradiation-induced lung lesions and because of the apparently anomalouschanges in post-irradiation damage which are observed. Further studiesare being made to determine if regional density values will provide amore sensitive index.</TEXT></DOC>
