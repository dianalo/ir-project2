Now they may start recommending soup to fight cancer, too. That is, if they buy the message in a new Campbell Soup Co. advertising campaign. The TV commercials note that cancer experts recommend a low-fat, high-fiber diet and that Campbell's bean and pea soups might therefore help prevent some types of cancer.    Health claims, particularly about cholesterol and calcium, have been creeping into food ads ever since Kellogg Co. linked its All-Bran cereal with cancer prevention in 1984. But this fall, marketers are capitalizing more aggressively than ever on consumers' fears of cancer and heart attacks.    &quot;We saw how sales of fiber cereals have grown since the Kellogg ads, and we wanted to let people know that soup is as good or better a source of fiber than cereal,&quot; says Dan Santangelo, vice president and general manager of Campbell's soup business.    Quaker Oats Co. is running new TV commercials that make the claim that eating oatmeal can actually help reduce cholesterol levels and be beneficial to the heart and blood. This health strategy could be an important weapon as Quaker tries to fend off General Mills Inc.'s new Total oatmeal.    THE PEPPERIDGE FARM division of Campbell Soup is also trying to appeal to consumers worried about heart ailments.    Its ads tout the fiber content of a new line of breads and note that &quot;diets high in soluble fiber can help lower serum cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.&quot; A Pepperidge Farm promotional brochure also relates fiber to cancer prevention.    &quot;We've noticed more health-related food ads since the Food and Drug Administration issued a proposed regulation in August allowing health claims on food labels,&quot; says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. &quot;But we believe the regulation is too vague and that it doesn't make companies tell the whole story about their products.&quot; He criticizes Campbell for playing up cancer prevention, while failing to point out the unhealthy, high-sodium content of the soup.    Some food companies still are proceeding cautiously. &quot;We are going to be making stronger claims about the presence of fiber and the absence of cholesterol in our muffins,&quot; a spokeswoman for Sara Lee Corp. says. &quot;But we let the consumer take it from there and draw his own conclusions. We communicate about product ingredients and quality, not how to live longer.&quot;    ---   Consumer Push for Painless Promotions    It's become a game of promotional one-upmanship every Sunday in cluttered newspaper advertising supplements. But juicier rebates and prizes may not be the best way to lure more people to participate in promotions. What busy consumers really want these days are painless promotions with an immediate payoff.    &quot;Time is such a precious commodity that many people will no longer collect box tops and fill out forms,&quot; says Mike Wahl, chairman of Howard Marlboro Group, a promotion marketing firm. &quot;Ask consumers to do something that takes some effort, and your response rate goes way down.&quot;    Perhaps the most onerous form of promotion is the mail-in refund offer. Consumer Network Inc., a Philadelphia market research firm, recently asked 400 people to comment on refunds; nearly half complained about the hassle of saving receipts and removing proofs of purchase from packages.    A few marketers are taking such gripes seriously and are experimenting with streamlined promotions. One new approach is a checklike certificate that is sent directly to consumers' homes. People redeem it right at the cash register, eliminating the need to mail in receipts and wait months for a rebate to arrive.    &quot;Checks appeal to consumers who are sick of complicated refunds that require them to send in their receipts the third Tuesday of the month along with a picture of their firstborn child,&quot; says Jennifer Davidoff, marketing director at Weber-Stephen Products Co. Donnelley Marketing in Stamford, Conn., developed a promotion for Weber in which consumers received $50 and $25 checks toward a $500 gas grill. In addition, Donnelley recently created discount checks for Canadian Club whiskey and Dutch Boy paints.    SEARS, ROEBUCK andamp; CO. and General Foods Corp. have devised a test promotion in California that they believe will satisfy people's desire for convenience and instant gratification. Consumers take proof-of-purchase seals from General Foods brands to a Sears store where they are converted on the spot into discount certificates on Sears merchandise.    Even the traditional green stamp might become a thing of the past. In response to consumers' complaints about the task of pasting in trading stamps, Sperry andamp; Hutchinson Co. is testing &quot;electronic green stamps&quot; in supermarkets in Connecticut. Instead of receiving paper stamps, consumers hand the cashier a plastic card. The card is inserted into a terminal that automatically records the number of stamps accrued.    &quot;We're finally joining the world of computers and plastic financial transactions,&quot; says Martin Cohen, Sandamp;H's marketing research director. Sandamp;H is also experimenting with green seals in several cities. People still have to put them in books, but at least the licking process is eliminated. </TEXT></DOC>
