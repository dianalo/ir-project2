Clark's two-run homer (his 16th) made itclose, but the faux pas proved costly.;    First, Willie McGee was on firstbase with two out in the first inning, and Kevin Mitchell grounded to third.McGee stood still for some reason and was forced out, saving third basemanDave Hollins from having to make the long throw to first. Although ManagerRoger Craig attributed it to McGee's sore right rib cage, McGee admitted hemade a mistake.;    &quot;I thought the ball was going foul, and I just didn'tbreak,&quot; McGee said. &quot;I don't know why I did that. I should have run.&quot;;    Thatwas one-upped by catcher Kirt Manwaring. He had been activated from thedisabled list during the day, and he had broken up this no-hit bid byMulholland with a fifth-inning single. Just as it seemed Manwaring was in fora heroic night, up to the plate stepped Mike Benjamin.;    Perhaps stunnedthat Benjamin (until then 2 for 43) hit safely, Manwaring forgot there weretwo out as he watched the ball carom off the left-field wall for what shouldhave been an RBI double. Manwaring thought there was one out, so he hesitatedto make sure the ball was not caught. Left fielder Wes Chamberlain had tochase down the ball as it bounded toward the infield, yet his throw to theplate easily nailed Manwaring.;    &quot;I thought it was pretty terrible,&quot;Manwaring said. &quot;To make a stupid baserunning mistake like that . . . Youshould learn that in T-ball. In pickup games, you learn how many outs thereare. It was just stupid baserunning.&quot;;    Manwaring could have tied the scoreat 1-1. Instead, the Phillies added a run in the seventh on Dickie Thon'ssingle -- chasing Trevor Wilson after a solid outing -- and another in theeighth when Giants-killer John Kruk homered off Jeff Brantley.;    Clark hadbeen 1 for 23 against Mulholland when he homered.;    &quot;I got a little stiffwaiting during the eighth,&quot; Mulholland said, and the homer was his exit cue.;   The Giants could score no more off reliever Mitch Williams despite puttingtwo runners on, and Clark was less interested in discussing his homer than hewas in Manwaring's quotes.;    &quot;In this game, with all the distractions, it'seasy to lose track of the outs,&quot; Clark said, sympathizing with Manwaring. &quot;Butif you lose track, you've got to say, 'I screwed up.' We all feel bad aboutit.&quot;;    There were other notable foul-ups. Mike Felder tried to sacrifice inthe sixth and bunted a pop-up to Mulholland. Benjamin made an error onHollins' grounder in the seventh, leading to an unearned run.;    The Giantswon their last two games of the first half, and they began the second halfwith a voluntary workout Thursday morning.;    &quot;Heck, the whole team cameout,&quot; Craig said, slightly exaggerating. &quot;It's hard to believe people aretalking about the (remote) chances of this club, when I saw what I sawtoday.&quot;;    Seeing what he saw after the first pitch, it was not so hard.; HOW THEY SCORED;    Phillies 4th -- Thon singled. With one out, Chamberlainsingled, moving Thon to third. Kruk singled, scoring Thon.
