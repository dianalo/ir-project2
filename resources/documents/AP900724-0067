Defendant Yusef Salaam, 16, repeatedly told Detective ThomasMcKenna he was not in the park the night of the attack, the lawofficer said on the witness stand Monday.   Convinced the boy had been there during the so-called``wilding'' attack, McKenna said: ``We have fingerprints from thejogger's pants. They're satin and very smooth. We'll compare thoseprints with yours, and if they match you don't have to sayanything. You're going for rape.''   McKenna said Salaam then told him: ``I was there but I didn'trape her.''   The detective admitted under cross-examination that he knew ofno such fingerprints and that his reference to them was a lie.Police found no fingerprints at the crime scene where theinvestment banker was beaten unconscious, gang-raped and left fordead.   Courts have upheld the use of deceit by police to extractconfessions as long as the accused were not threatened, coerced orimproperly advised of their rights.   After Salaam's alleged confession, McKenna said he then asked:``How could you possibly do something like this?''   ``It was just something to do; it was fun,'' McKenna quotedSalaam as saying, referring to handwritten notes.   The April 19, 1989, attack was allegedly carried out by a gangof youths roving the park looking for random victims _ a practiceknown by the slang term ``wilding.''   Salaam admitted hitting the woman with a pipe and fondling her,and gave the names of other youths who allegedly assaulted her,McKenna testified. Unlike other defendants, Salaam gave police novideotaped or signed written statement.   Salaam's lawyer, Robert Burns, denied his client made thestatements that McKenna recounted. He tried unsuccessfully to getthe testimony barred from the trial.   Salaam, Antron McCray, and Raymond Santana, all 16, are beingtried on charges of rape, attempted murder, sexual abuse, assault,robbery and riot in connection with the attack on the woman andless serious attacks on two male joggers.   The woman, now 30, is back at work at Salomon Brothers Inc.investment banking firm, but suffers from impaired vision andbalance and has lost her sense of smell as a result of the assault.   Three other youths charged in the attack are to stand triallater this year.</TEXT></DOC>
