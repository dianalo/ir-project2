Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.) asserts that &quot;Term Limits AreUnconstitutional&quot; in his Feb. 13 Counterpoint column. Hejoins the ranks of House Speaker Tom Foley and other insiderswho say this loudly and often to help make it come true. Butthis bipartisan chorus ignores one essential fact: To bedeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, an enactmentmust violate some principle contained in the Constitution.And the Constitution is silent on the issue of limitingcongressmen's years of service. Likewise, the record of theConstitutional Convention reveals no debate on the subject,and there is no reference to the issue of rotation in office(term limitations) in the Federalist Papers.   Rep. Kolbe's quotation from Federalist Paper No. 53 istaken out of context, and is not from a discussion of termlimits at all. The issue being addressed by Madison in thatpaper was an explanation of why representatives' terms shouldbe two years, rather than one.</LP><TEXT>   While Mr. Kolbe has claimed Madison and Hamilton as hisproof of the Founding Fathers' opposition to term limits, itshould be remembered that one of Jefferson's primarycriticisms of the draft Constitution was its failure toexplicitly establish limitations on service.   Washington, in keeping with Jefferson's concerns and everthe gentleman, apparently didn't require a written mandate toknow that good sense, proper conduct and a keen understandingof the appropriate balance between public duty and personalaggrandizement dictated a voluntary relinquishment of hisoffice after two terms. Term-limit supporters should have noqualms about casting our lot with the likes of Washington andJefferson.   Rep. Kolbe, Speaker Foley and others dismiss the role ofstate election laws in the electoral process governingfederal candidates, thus ignoring the reality of twocenturies. Limiting congressmen's service has nothing to dowith their qualifications or eligibility to serve, and thestates have long since assumed great responsibility fordetermining who can and cannot be considered for federaloffices from the respective states.   If anyone doubts the applicability of state election lawsto federal candidates, consider the current plight ofDemocratic presidential contender Larry Agran, former mayorof Irvine, Calif. He is over 35 years old, a natural-borncitizen and has been a resident of the U.S. for 14 yearstheonly qualifications to be president set forth in theConstitution. Yet, 16 states have declined to place Mr.Agran's name on their presidential primary ballots forreasons having nothing to do with his constitutionalqualifications. Paul Tsongas will not find his name on theballot for president in my home state of Oklahoma, because hehas failed to meet the peculiar requirements of its stateelection laws. Eligibility to serve in federal office is notsynonymous with access to the voters through the variousstates' election procedures.   Rep. Kolbe advises that the people should ignore the powervested in them by the 10th Amendment and instead devote theirefforts to pleading with members of Congress to eliminatecongressional life tenure. This &quot;Mother, May I?&quot; approach isguaranteed to fail.   Of course, if Mr. Kolbe and his colleagues wish to enactlimits on their own service, the American people wouldwelcome it, but I imagine a congressionally imposed limitwould about match the life expectancy of the Africanelephant. Or, Mr. Kolbe and his colleagues could voluntarilyleave office after six, eight or 12 years. Because no one ofsound mind believes Congress collectively or individuallywill act to curtail the careerism on Capitol Hill, it isessential that the people march on to enact term limitsthrough the state election process.   True judicial conservatives cannot believe popularlyenacted limits on congressional service -- which violate noconstitutional principle, expressed or implied -- will bestricken down by the Supreme Court. And no amount ofcongressional wishful thinking can make it otherwise.   Cleta Deatherage Mitchell   Director and General Counsel   Term Limits Legal Institute   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
