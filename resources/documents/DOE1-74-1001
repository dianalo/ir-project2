The work is crucial to a fundamental understanding of AIresearch, and presents a basic guide for the fruitful, goal-directedimplementation of such research, whether approached from the cognitivescience direction, in which syntactical, semantical and pragmatical theoriesof mind are concerned, or from a more instrumental perspective, concernedwith the theoretical character of patterns of reasoning used in AI. Philosophers,it must be remembered, have been studying such questions for a long timeand the fruits of their discussions are of acute relevance to modernAI workers.</TEXT></DOC>
