The contention over the bill, which includes items ranging from federal pay to funding for Internal Revenue Service agents, focuses on two arms-control provisions and a long list of spending measures that the president said were excessive.    Debate on the measure illustrates the Reagan administration's recent passivity on budgetary matters. The White House and many of its GOP allies in Congress appear happy in large part to have the Democrats take the lead on fiscal legislation, believing that their choices will be an easy target for criticism.    Meanwhile, the Democrats chide the Republicans for acting irresponsibly by only expressing complaints that Democrats say aren't backed by thoughtful alternatives. And efforts by congressional Republicans to persuade the White House to become an active participant in the coming budget debate in the Senate have proven unavailing.    White House Communications Director Thomas Griscom spelled out the administration position at a meeting of Senate Republican staff aides this week. &quot;We still want to make it clear what Republicans stand for and what Democrats stand for,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;We've got to smoke them out.&quot;    Mr. Griscom then brushed aside remarks by aides that suggested Republicans should compromise with the Democrats on budgetary plans sometime soon.    &quot;It's the Democrats' responsibility since they have (majority control of) both houses of Congress,&quot; another senior White House official said. &quot;We aren't encouraging or trying to push a GOP alternative.&quot;    The rejection of early compromise marks a defeat for Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), who met with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker Wednesday. Sen. Domenici, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, received a cordial hearing, but left empty-handed.    In the House supplemental appropriations bill, the largest item was $6.6 billion to replenish Commodity Credit Corp. funds for farm subsidies. It was one of the few issues on which the Democrats and Republicans agreed. The total reflected an amendment, approved by voice vote, to reduce the CCC allocation by the $90 million that federal authorities have said constitutes fraudulent claims for farm subsidies.    The final bill is expected to allot about $4.7 billion less than the president requested for military spending and foreign aid and spread most of those funds over other programs, including aid for the homeless, child-health programs and disaster relief for farmers.    Overall, the president requested about $1 billion more in appropriations than the House bill would provide. But the president would have offset the increases with about $5.7 billion in recisions of previous appropriations. These recission requests were rejected by the House.    The House bill calls for about $2.1 billion in spending above the budget ceilings approved by Congress for fiscal 1987, which ends Sept. 30. Republicans didn't offer an alternative, though they proposed a long series of amendments to strike parts of the bill.    One of those amendments, which would delete the bill's $651 million in foreign aid, could ultimately shrink the total figure. GOP members criticized the way the legislation would allocate the aid, which was about half the amount requested by the president. The amendment won narrow approval last night, but Democratic leaders said the House will reverse the measure before completing the bill.    On the bill as a whole, the Republicans' chief complaint concerned two arms-control provisions. The first would, in effect, require the Reagan administration to comply with an unratified 1979 strategic arms-limitation treaty, which has been technically violated by a recent White House-sanctioned deployment. The second would bar all but the smallest nuclear weapons tests, as long as the Soviets also refrain from testing.    GOP members said the provisions tied the president's hands in arms negotiations with the Soviets; Democrats asserted the measures helped the process. These arms-control amendments face a tough fight in the Senate, where Republicans have threatened a filibuster.    Meanwhile, in deliberations on the defense budget for fiscal 1988, the House Armed Services Committee stripped $17 billion from its earlier defense-authorization bill. The action would bring the defense budget to $289 billion, which is the level specified by the House budget resolution and is $23 billion less than the president's request. Subcommittees yesterday stretched out dozens of programs and cut further on planned weapons procurement.    Particularly hard hit was the president's Strategic Defense Initiative. The panel voted to cut another $200 million from the administration request, reducing the funding for the anti-missile research project to $3.3 billion. The administration had sought $5.8 billion for fiscal 1988.    The Army's Achille remotely piloted vehicle was another casualty. The panel voted to eliminate this program, at least for the next fiscal year. Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., is the main contractor on the project, which is funded at $115.3 million in the current fiscal year. </TEXT></DOC>
