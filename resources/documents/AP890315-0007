Peter Wilkinson, a spokesman for the environmental group, saidthe waste showed high levels of heavy metals, such as cadmium, andthat the protest was part of a stepped up campaign for a cleanup ofthe McMurdo base.   Embassy spokesman Mike Gould dismissed claims that the contentswere toxic, saying the liquid was nothing more than normal organicsewage.   He said the delivery of the drums was ``nothing but publicposturing.''   ``The Americans are causing a lot of environmental problems inAntarctica,'' Wilkinson said. ``They have one of the worst records.They must have a sense of responsibility and we are going to make anexample out of them.''   Lined up in front of the embassy gate, the barrels read ``Danger!Cadmium.''   Wilkinson said the waste was collected during the group's recentexpedition to Antarctica. He accused the United States of grossneglect of the fragile environment there, saying Greenpeace haddetected chromium, lead and copper in wastes dumped into the oceanfrom McMurdo.   He said the level of cadmium was far in excess of that permittedin Europe or the United States.   The embassy called in local authorities to remove the barrelsafter Greenpeace refused to take them away.   Gould said Greenpeace had failed to acknowledge that theWashington-based National Science Foundation, which oversees U.S.activities in Antarctica, was committed to cleaning up McMurdo.   McMurdo, the largest station in Antarctica, was set up in 1957.Several hundred people work there during the Southern Hemispheresummer.</TEXT></DOC>
