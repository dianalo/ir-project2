Conway Jr., senior vice president and chief financial officer.    Addressing securities analysts here, he said also the Washington-based long-distance carrier would have positive cash flow by the end of 1988. MCI also expects to raise $350 million in lease financing this year, he added.    Bert C. Roberts, president and chief operating officer, also said William G. McGowan, chairman and chief executive officer, intends to return to the company after recuperating from a heart attack. As previously reported, the 59-year-old executive is recovering more slowly than expected since being stricken in December. Mr. Roberts declined to speculate about the date of Mr. McGowan's return to the company.    Late last year, MCI disclosed plans to cut capital spending this year by $100 million, to about $800 million. The executives told analysts yesterday that they can continue to reduce it by $100 million annually because previous capital spending is paying off.    Though MCI's cash flow will turn positive in 1988, Mr. Conway emphasized that it might not be positive cash flow for the entire year.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI shares closed at $6.375, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
