The six-member trade panel ruled unanimously that the imports, totaling about $138 million last year from all foreign suppliers, aren't injuring the domestic industry.    The American Cutlery Manufacturers Association, on behalf of U.S. producers, had petitioned the commission for import relief under the &quot;escape clause&quot; provisions of the 1974 Trade Act.    However, the industry group wasn't able to persuade the panel to recommend import restrictions, such as an increase in the current 5% import duties to about 55% to slow imports. The inquiry covered kitchen knives, hunting knives and other types of cutlery.    According to the trade panel, imports of knives from Taiwan last year totaled about 37 million pieces; from Japan, 36 million; Hong Kong, nine million; Brazil, 5.7 million; South Korea, about three million; with smaller quantities from other countries. </TEXT></DOC>
