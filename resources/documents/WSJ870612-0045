Buying in the soybean meal pit sent contracts for July and August delivery soaring to new lifetime highs as continued speculation about Soviet demand for meal helped fuel trading. The rumors remain unconfirmed.    &quot;So far its all smoke and no fire; there's been very little outright commercial buying,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.    The weather service revised its forecast to normal to above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall in the coming days from previous predictions of normal temperatures and good rainfall over much of the Cornbelt. The revision boosted prices, with contracts for delivery after the fall harvest making the sharpest gains.    &quot;Even though we're not in the critical growth stage, aggressive traders want in on the long side of this market,&quot; said Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.    Although there were scattered showers in some parts of the Midwest Wednesday night, they were much lighter than forecasted.    &quot;Nothing is hurt by it yet,&quot; said David Taylor, chief climatologist at Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass., &quot;but it's slowly building a deficit&quot; of moisture in the soil, and that &quot;may put great stress on the (corn) crop during tasseling.&quot;    Continued hot and dry weather -- and strength in the meal market -- will be needed to keep the rally going, Mr. Lespinasse said.    Wheat futures were lower as the hot and dry conditions signaled a return to harvesting of the winter wheat crop.    In other futures market yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly futures prices rebounded from Wednesday's lows as the July and August contracts rose their daily limits. Hog futures also finished higher. The markets got a boost from stronger pork product prices and expectations that cash hog prices will be rising in the coming days. Cattle futures were unchanged to slightly lower as traders awaited Monday's seven state cattle-on-feed report. The Agriculture Department is scheduled to release the report after the close of trading.    COPPER: Continued tightness in supplies for near-term delivery once again fueled demand. The July contract rose 1.35 cents a pound to 71 cents, a life-of-contract high. The contract's advance during the day to its previous high of 70.5 cents touched off more buying and accelerated the rise. The advance reached 71.25 cents before aggressive selling trimmed the gain, analysts said. July copper continued to trade at a premium to the more deferred months, and, in fact, widened the premium modestly, analysts said. However, at least one broker noted the appearance of somewhat greater offerings of copper in the cash market and attributed this to the impending arrival in the U.S. of copper from London.    SUGAR: Indications that world demand for physical sugar may rise prompted buying of contracts, analysts said. The July contract rose 0.18 cent a pound to 6.65 cents, almost at the day's high. The market has lacked sustained support lately, partly because of an absence of major buyers such as the Soviet Union, China and India, an analyst said. Now, he said, there are reports that the Soviet Union &quot;is looking around.&quot; It had been expected to buy more sugar. Adding firmness to the market was the weekly report by F.O. Licht, a West German firm, which said cool weather and rains have delayed development of the European beet sugar crop. Anything but ideal weather, especially early in the season, tends to make traders uneasy. However, the European crop has plenty of time to recover from any problems around this time, an analyst said.    COFFEE: Volcanic activity in Colombia, the world's second-largest coffee grower, touched off buying of futures, but late selling trimmed the advance. The July contract gained 0.77 cent to $1.1299 a pound after rising as high as $1.146. According to a New York importer and dealer who has been in touch with Colombian growers in the area of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano, there was some ash falling and a smell of sulfur two days ago. &quot;At the moment the feeling down there is that there is nothing to worry about, and that if volcanic activity was to continue, the danger was more to life than to coffee trees,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;Coffee is grown on the mountainsides, while people live in the valley,&quot; he said. &quot;Some coffee in the path of the lava flowing down the mountainside would be destroyed, but the great damage would be in the valley where the lava accumulates.&quot; The volcano last erupted in November 1985, when it killed about 20,000 people and left a lake of dried lava many miles long, he said. Volcanic ash doesn't affect the quality of the coffee beans and, in fact, helps to fertilize the soil for the next crop, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
