President Bush also should pressure the Central IntelligenceAgency to get information he has indicated the United States needsto rescue American hostages, to take a strong stand againstterrorism, retired Army Col. Charlie Beckwith said Thursday.   ``If we don't do this, it's going to keep on getting worse andworse,'' Beckwith said.   Terrorists claimed they killed one American hostage, Marine Lt.Col. William Higgins, on Monday, and have threatened to killanother, Joseph Cicippio, after Israel captured a Shiite Moslemreligious leader accused of promoting terrorism.   ``I'd like to see the United States be able to go in there andeliminate all of those terrorists and bring those beautifulhostages home,'' Beckwith said. ``I'd like to see us do it in sucha vigorous way that we tell the rest of the world, `Never fool withthe United States again.'''   Beckwith, a security consultant, led troops in the aborted 1980attempt to rescue American hostages being held by Iran. EightAmericans died in that mission.   Beckwith criticized the CIA as not being active enough sincedirector William Casey died in 1987.   The CIA relies too heavily on electronic wizardry and hasforgotten about the need for ``a pair of good solid eyeballs, and agood human being on the ground,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
