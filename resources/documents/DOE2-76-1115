These resources aresupplying about 6% of all electricity used in California. However, thecompetitiveness of power generation using lower quality hydrothermalfluids, geopressured brines, hot dry rock, and magma still depends onthe technology improvements sought by the DOE Geothermal Energy R andD Program. The successful outcome of the R and D initiatives will serveto benefit the US public in a number of ways. First, if a substantialportion of our geothermal resources can be used economically, they willadd a very large source of secure, indigenous energy to the nation'senergy supply. In addition, geothermal plants can be brought on linequickly in case of a national energy emergency. Geothermal energy isalso a highly reliable resource, with very high plant availability. Forexample, new dry steam plants at The Geysers are operable over 99% ofthe time, and the small flash plant in Hawaii, only the second in theUnited States, has an availability factor of 98%. Geothermal plants alsooffer a viable baseload alternative to fossil and nuclear plants -- theyare on line 24 hours a day, unaffected by diurnal or seasonal variations.The hydrothermal power plants with modern emission control technologyhave proved to have minimal environmental impact. The results to datewith geopressured and hot dry rock resources suggest that they, too,can be operated so as to reduce environmental effects to well withinthe limits of acceptability. Preliminary studies on magma are also encouraging.In summary, the character and potential of geothermal energy, togetherwith the accomplishments of DOE's Geothermal R and D Program, ensurethat this huge energy resource will play a major role in future US energymarkets. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
