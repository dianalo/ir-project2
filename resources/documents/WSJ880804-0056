(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories said they have trained unruly electrons to go straight for more than 50 yards in experiments to see whether the beams may be used as &quot;Star Wars&quot; missile-killers.    The experiments were conducted in a 184-foot tube that simulates conditions in the upper atmosphere, the scientists said in yesterday's Albuquerque Journal.    Scientists said it is the first time they have gotten two-million-electron-volt beams to travel that far.    Electron beams can become unstable and whip around violently as their negative charges repel each other when they emerge from a particle accelerator.    If they could travel in a straight line for long distances, they might be used to disable incoming warheads or to differentiate between warheads and decoys as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, said James Rice, manager of directed energy research at Sandia.    Training the direction of the electron beams has involved using a channel of hot, electrically charged plasma gas, which acts as a kind of wire to carry the beam's current, scientists said.    Mr. Rice said electron beams can penetrate deep into a target, deposit their energy and produce X-rays. Analyzing the amount and type of X-rays yielded by a target could help differentiate between a warhead and a decoy, he said.    Other applications for such beams include high-speed X-ray photography, welding, the study of the effects of rapid heating, and simulation of the effects of nuclear bursts, the scientists said. </TEXT></DOC>
