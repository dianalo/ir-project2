He said the government has no idea who was behind the hoax.   Fitzwater and other White House officials said that Bush placedthe call after a man identifying himself as an Iranian governmentofficial called the White House to say that Rafsanjani wanted totalk to Bush about U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.   ``The call came in, a number was given for us to call. We weresuspicious and began checking,'' Fitzwater said. ``But, ultimately,the president needed to make the call as part of the check. He didmake the call.''   The call, first reported by CBS News, came to a staff member ofthe White House National Security Council, aides said.   ``The president has made it known he's willing to talk to Iranat any time,'' Fitzwater said. ``And the ball is in their court.''   The Bush administration has contended that Rafsanjani'sgovernment has influence with the captors of eight Americans andcitizens of 10 European countries being held in Lebanon.   Fitzwater said that the administration has let Rafsanjani know``through diplomatic channels as well as publicly, that we'rewilling to talk whenever they're ready. And they have come back andsaid, `We're not ready.'''   The caller said the Iranian president wanted to speak to Bush,and ``various methods were used to check'' the legitimacy of thecall, said another White House aide, Stephen Hart.   Since the president ``has stated he would talk to anybody if itwould help free the hostages,'' Bush agreed to talk to Rafsanjani,Hart said.   Fitzwater and Hart declined to answer further questions aboutthe affair, such as how the hoax was discovered or what Bush saidto the caller.   Asked if Bush immediately realized that the voice on the otherend of the line was not Rafsanjani, Fitzwater said: ``I can't tellyou how we determined it was a hoax.''   He said he didn't want to get into anything ``that goes to thepoint of how we check out phone calls.''   However, he indicated that the person on the other end of theline did not identify himself as a hoaxer.   CBS said the call came first to Brent Scowcroft, nationalsecurity adviser to the president, and was checked out by ``variousintelligence methods.''   In his conversation with the unknown caller, the president``repeated U.S. policy that goodwill will beget goodwill but therecould be no quid pro quo for U.S. hostages,'' the network said.   Bush first used the phrase ``goodwill will beget goodwill'' inhis inaugural address 14 months ago.   Recent days have seen a flurry of speculative stories aboutwhether the hostages might be freed, and the White House has saidit was encouraged by recent comments of Rafsanjani to the effectthat a solution might be achieved soon.   The Tehran Times, a newspaper close to Iran's president, said inan editorial that 1990 would be the last year of captivity for thehostages.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Tuesday ``we areencouraged by the fact that there is speculation'' about a releaseof the hostages. ``Let's see if that speculation proves out.''   The White House has said it was not negotiating directly withIran, and it has said it would make no deals for the freedom of thehostages. But ``a great deal is being done that is notpublicized,'' said Mike Kraft, an official in the StateDepartment's counter-terrorism office, on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
