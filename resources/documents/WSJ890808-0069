The complaint could lead to a re-examination of the commission's policy on dominant carriers -- something ATandamp;T has been informally pushing for during the past two years as MCI and U.S. Sprint Communications have bitten into ATandamp;T's market share.    The unusual complaint, filed with the FCC, maintains that MCI is required to file rates and terms of its service offerings, just as does ATandamp;T. The commission, however, adopted rules in 1983 making tariffs optional for so-called non-dominant carriers such as MCI and U.S. Sprint, which is controlled by United Telecommunications.    In the complaint, ATandamp;T, which has more than 70% of the long-distance market, acknowledged that the commission has different rules for ATandamp;T, as the market's dominant carrier, than for the other long-distance companies. ATandamp;T noted, however, that although MCI challenged the commission's rules in 1983 to make sure that all carriers had to file tariffs, MCI now files tariffs selectively. &quot;The law is unambiguous,&quot; said Tom Norris, ATandamp;T's vice president, federal regulatory affairs. &quot;MCI and others seem to be doing this to an increasing degree.&quot;    In a letter accompanying the complaint, ATandamp;T said it had viewed the commission's &quot;forbearance from regulating non-dominant carriers as a transitional, interim step that would lead quickly&quot; to ending unneeded regulation of all carriers.    ATandamp;T contended that the rules have given MCI and other carriers &quot;unwarranted advantages&quot; because they can offer some customers attractive rates without disclosing details to the FCC and, thus, to competitors. Meantime, the FCC requires ATandamp;T to make detailed disclosures.    ATandamp;T has made some headway on the tariff issue, winning FCC approval to offer custom-designed services for big business customers without disclosing all of the features and prices. FCC officials said late yesterday that they hadn't read the complaint and had no immediate comment.    MCI called the complaint &quot;a smokescreen to achieve ATandamp;T's own deregulation through the complaint process. ATandamp;T's real motive is to challenge the FCC's competitive-carrier policy and rules, not to attack MCI particularly in the way it conducts business as a non-dominant carrier.&quot;    The spokeswoman said MCI files tariffs on most services, but that with big business customers it provides discount services under contract and doesn't file details of those agreements with the FCC.    ATandamp;T wants the commission to investigate and stop the alleged abuses, and is seeking unspecified damages &quot;equal to the net revenue ATandamp;T has lost on account of MCI's unlawful practices&quot; plus interest.    ATandamp;T said MCI has unlawfully failed to file tariffs for providing telecommunications services to Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Westin Hotels Co., United Airlines unit of UAL Corp., the Pentagon, University of Colorado at Boulder and Unigard Security Insurance Co., as well as other companies. Westin Hotels is owned by Robert M. Bass Group and Aoki Corp. of Japan.    In the Merrill Lynch example, ATandamp;T said that it figured MCI's offer was at rates at least 8.5% below the lowest rates specified in MCI tariffs. MCI won the contract in June. </TEXT></DOC>
