They were businesses with a black focus of one sort or another, painstakingly built up over long years of effort.    Now there is an alternative. A new breed of entrepreneur is reshaping the traditional way blacks do business. This new black businessman is color-blind, takes direction from Wall Street, acquires companies that cater to mainstream America -- and is fast overtaking the familiar titans.    Johnson Publishing, long at the head of a noted top-100 list, suddenly finds itself a distant second to a company that got where it is through a leveraged buy-out. Reginald Lewis's TLC Group Inc., by taking over the international foods division of Beatrice Inc. last year, has vaulted to the top of Black Enterprise magazine's newest list with 1987 sales of $1.8 billion -- nine times Johnson's.    People like TLC's chief differ in background as well as methods from the legendary builders of black enterprise, mostly self-taught men who amassed their fortunes slowly by marketing ethnic products in poor communities. The new breed is college-educated, corporate-trained -- and not notably patient. &quot;We want success to come quickly,&quot; says Robert C. Davidson Jr., the owner of Surface Protection Industries Inc., a Los Angeles paint company.    To accomplish that, they are challenging some fundamental black business precepts, especially the idea of marketing first and foremost to black consumers. Just as companies controlled by whites have increasingly diversified their products and services to attract minorities, the future prosperity of black firms lies in &quot;plugging into broader markets,&quot; contends Dwight White, the chief executive of Daniels andamp; Bell Inc., a black-owned investment banking firm in New York. &quot;We must make and sell products that all people consume.&quot;    That has been the guiding principle of attorney J. Bruce Llewellyn, chairman of Coca-Cola Bottling of Philadelphia and Queen City Broadcasting Corp. &quot;I don't want to be limited to only one segment of the population -- and the smallest segment at that,&quot; he says. When Mr. Llewellyn was brought in to turn around a troubled New York minority bank some years ago, &quot;I told {its managers} this was not a black bank, it was a bank operated by black people,&quot; he says. And when he acquired Queen City Broadcasting, he consciously modeled its growth strategy after that of a major mainstream corporation, Capital Cities/ABC Inc.    &quot;We've gotten to the point in this country where the question is whether the product is good, not who makes it,&quot; says Robert Holland, a co-owner of Gilreath Industries Inc., an acquisition-minded Detroit auto-parts and engineering concern. Mr. Davidson, whose paint company has tripled its sales in three years (to $25 million), estimates that only one-fifth of his customers are even aware he's black.    Still, some blacks have discovered that crossover isn't that simple. Aiming for the mainstream may open opportunities traditional black businesses never envisioned, but it also brings sensitive marketing and management challenges -- and much tougher competition. Some believe they must work longer than whites to gain both the confidence of financiers and consumer acceptance of their products -- obstacles they tried to avoid by entering the mainstream in the first place.    Others have trouble retaining the support of their white managers, whose knowledge can be critical to the company's success. Nevertheless, the strong wish to enter the market mainstream is prompting blacks to acquire a wide spectrum of businesses, from commercial manufacturing and consumer products to technology and financial services.    Their efforts aren't entirely unprecedented. As early as the 1920s, black-owned caterers thrived by servicing affluent urban whites, particularly in large Northern cities. And in the 1960s, Berry Gordy's Motown record company deliberately tried to create &quot;crossover&quot; recording stars who appealed to whites as well as blacks, succeeding hugely with Diana Ross and the Supremes.    But many concerns trying to crack the general market say they faced formidable barriers because of perceptions that black companies were unreliable or their products low-quality. Consider Johnson Products Co.'s experience when, in the late 1970s, it launched &quot;Black Tie,&quot; a line of men's toiletries that was heavily advertised using mostly white actors and models.    Johnson Products (it isn't related to Johnson Publishing) had a 20-year track record and was the largest publicly held company controlled by blacks. Yet merchants recognized it as the maker of hair pomades and tonics used by blacks, and were reluctant to stock the new product. Though Black Tie wasn't intended as a blacks-only product, &quot;it always ended up in the store's ethnic section,&quot; says a Johnson executive, Gregory Andrews, and the limited sales contributed to the line's eventual failure.    One way to avoid such stereotyping is, instead of starting a company, to buy a white-controlled one. That's what Carlton and Michael Guthrie did. Carlton, a Harvard M.B.A., and Michael, a graduate of Harvard Law, three years ago acquired a 15-year-old Lansing, Mich., metal-stamping concern called Trumark Inc. They got financing for the $10 million leveraged buyout from a unit of Barclays Bank PLC. When seeking orders, &quot;there are no black/white connotations,&quot; says Carlton Guthrie.    Blacks nurturing the Wall Street version of the entrepreneurial dream have some corporate trends on their side. In finance, the emergence of LBOs and asset lending make big acquisitions possible with a small personal outlay. Large companies' taste for streamlining has put attractive divisions and subsidiaries on the block. And organizations like Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH have helped by encouraging companies like Coca-Cola Co. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. to sell bottling franchises to black investors.    So far, the methods of the new black financiers still represent only a small segment of all black businesses. But &quot;the trend is so pronounced that in another 10 years or so there will be a noticeable change&quot; in the size and strength of the average black company, contends Timothy Bates, an American Statistical Association economist.    Typifying the new breed is Mr. Holland of Gilreath Industries, the auto-parts company in inner-city Detroit. Graduating with an engineering degree 24 years ago, Mr. Holland was recruited as a trainee at Mobil Corp. for $500 a month, a level, he says, that was &quot;50% lower than that for the rest of my classmates, including the guy who was flunking out.&quot; While at Mobil he earned an M.B.A., and shortly afterwards he moved to McKinsey andamp; Co.    There he moved up quickly, becoming a partner at the management consulting firm. But he resigned in the early '80s to begin private consulting for a small group of former clients. And soon his connections led to his first acquisition: Stroh Brewery Co.'s Detroit distributorship. Though banks wouldn't touch the proposed buy-out, he finally was able to do the deal by using his own funds and getting financing and a credit guarantee from Stroh itself.    That wasn't enough for him, though. &quot;After working at McKinsey, I wasn't content running a company that had sales of only $20 million,&quot; Mr. Holland says. &quot;But it gave me a platform for my other agendas.&quot; Last year, he sold the distributorship and teamed up with Walter Ross, a former ITT Corp. executive. They haven't wasted any time.    The partners bought Gilreath Industries last October, and in January they tripled its annual sales to the $75 million level by buying a half interest in an engineering firm and two additional auto-parts makers. The strategy: Build a full-service autoparts design and manufacturing concern with sales -- aided by more acquisitions -- of $200 million by year-end.    The new appreciation of the wonders of finance is one obvious difference in the new breed of black businessman, but there are others. The older, self-taught generation has tended to hold company secrets close to the vest, often reluctant to share power. &quot;They came up in the '30s and '40s when it could have been dangerous to trust too many people,&quot; says James Lowry, a black management consultant in Chicago. &quot;It's hard for them to break away from that.&quot; The new entrepreneurs are more likely to delegate authority, and also to groom other blacks for high office within the company. They often view themselves as deal makers and empire builders, rather than hands-on operators.    But building a business rapidly and through acquisition presents problems of its own. For one thing, an acquired company usually comes complete with a large cadre of white managers, used to working for somebody else. &quot;White managers accept the worst possible stereotypes about blacks,&quot; contends Mr. Lowry, who advises new black owners to move quickly to forge an open relationship with managers and gain their confidence. That's essential, he says, because &quot;managers can make you or break you.&quot;    Consider the management problems that beset Air Atlanta, an airline headed by Michael Hollis, a black lawyer and former investment banker who became a vice president at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. at age 27 and started the airline at 31. Now in liquidation, Air Atlanta was racked by bitter management feuds and personality clashes between Mr. Hollis and his senior white executives. While its downfall stemmed largely from insufficient capital, the internal struggle rushed the demise.    &quot;It was hard for the senior white executives to accept a black chief executive,&quot; says Daniel Kolber, a former Air Atlanta executive vice president who is white. He describes Mr. Hollis as &quot;extremely brilliant&quot; but as having &quot;a very large ego.&quot; They are characteristics, Mr. Kolber maintains, that may be admired in white managers but viewed as arrogance in blacks.    Though no one knows how many blacks have acquired mainstream American companies in recent years, economists believe the numbers are growing steadily. And as these companies spin off black managers who may one day in turn acquire companies, some social scientists hope the phenomenon will touch the lives of people in poverty.    A study by Mr. Bates at the American Statistical Society found that firms controlled by blacks -- regardless of size and industry -- hire a disproportionately large number of black workers. It also found that predominantly white corporate work forces quickly became largely black when black leadership took control, without a loss of productivity or profitability.    The effects can go beyond the work force. At Trumark, the Guthrie brothers sponsor a program that provides educational aid and counseling in nutrition, parenting and stress to area single mothers. Similar business-sponsored &quot;self-help&quot; programs have begun in other cities. &quot;We were active in community development prior to entering business,&quot; says Carlton Guthrie, &quot;and now we intend to use the company as a vehicle to become even more active.&quot;    ---    Largest Black-Owned Industrial and Service Companies    NAME (LOCATION)                          1987 Sales       CHIEF EXECUTIVE                      (In millions)    TLC Group (New York)       Reginald F.
