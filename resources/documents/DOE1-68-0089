The lithium surface fractionisdetermined by direct recoil spectroscopic (DRS) measurement of theH, C, and O added to the surface by methanol exposure and by subsequentcomparison to the amounts of C, O, and metal determined by auger electronspectroscopy (AES) or x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Directdetermination of surface Li by AES or XPS is complicated by relativelylarge sampling depths (5 or 20 A). The indirect determination of surfaceLi by methanol chemisorption/AES has been used to calibrate the sensitivityof 5-keV K{sup +} DRS for lithium.</TEXT></DOC>
