(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, accusing the Soviet Unionof interfering in the Western Hemisphere by sending arms toNicaragua, says he's not ready to set a date for a summit meetingwith Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   ``I feel under no rush on that subject,'' Bush told reportersMonday at a news conference in Helena, Mont., before flying here forthe night.   The president, on a two-day tour of western states celebratingtheir 100th anniversary, also said he was not about to be pressuredon the issue of arms control by reports of a new Soviet proposal.   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is expected to meet withBush at the White House on Thursday, before Shevardnadze's meetingbeginning the following day in Jackson Hole, Wyo., with Secretary ofState James A. Baker III.   Bush conceded he had heard, but could not personally confirm,speculation that Shevardnadze would bring with him a new proposalfor limiting long-range nuclear missiles.   However, Bush said, ``We're not going to just react to hisproposals. We're going to be very interested and welcome them, butwe just simply cannot and will not keep reacting.''   Bush denied he was dragging his feet on entering negotiationswith the Soviets on limiting ballistic missiles, although heconceded this might be the perception because had focused attentionearlier in his administration ``into getting conventional forcestability'' in Europe.   Asked about a summit with Gorbachev, Bush said he first wanted toawait results of the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting. A superpower summitis expected to be one issue on the agenda.   Suggesting that Soviet intentions still leave a lot to bedesired, Bush said: ``We have interests in this hemisphere where theSoviets are continuing to send ... increased amounts of arms goinginto Nicaragua right now over last year. That's not very good.That's not a very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that the Bushadministration has reacted timidly to events in Eastern Europe andshould actively support the forces of democratic change in thecommunist world.   He called on Bush to support the entry of communist nations intoWestern economic institutions, ``once their internal reforms meritsuch participation.''   ``Now is the time for the United States to encourage andcapitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long,'' Mitchellsaid in a Senate speech. ``The administration's timidity in the faceof these opportunities is puzzling and dismaying. Instead ofencouragement and engagment, the administration has adopted analmost passive stance.''   On another issue involving Latin America, Bush said he did notfear for his safety or for that of his family because of reporteddeath threats from Colombian drug lords, saying he had confidence inthe Secret Service.   He said there was ``no hard intelligence evidence'' of thetargeting of his family or of any other Americans by drug interestsin Colombia.   ``But, clearly, any such action would, I think, just bring downthe total wrath of the American people and the Americangovernment,'' he said.   On another topic, Bush said he was not ready to restore normalrelations with the People's Republic of China, saying there has beenlittle apparent change in that government's attitudes since Chinesetroops fired on unarmed demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Squarelast spring.   ``It's not a time for total normalcy,'' Bush said.   His administration announced on Monday it intends to givemost-favored-nation trade status to Hungary. Bush praised Hungary'scommunist government at his news conference for allowing thousandsof East Germans to flock across its borders en route to freedom inWest Germany.   Asked whether he favors the reunification of Germany, Bush said:``I would think it's a matter for the Germans to decide.''   But, he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out betweenthe Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Westerninterests.''   Bush, returning to Soviet issues, said he was not ready to relaxtrade restrictions on the Soviet Union like he is doing for Hungary.   He said that, despite some reported progress, the Soviet Unionstill is not permitting free emigration of Soviet Jews and otherminorities.   ``I think things are improving, but I think as long as someone isheld in a country against their will because they can't get out, itis a matter of human concern,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
