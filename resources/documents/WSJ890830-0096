All that was missing most days as fire raged across huge sections of Yellowstone and several Western states was the thump-thump of helicopter blades and a Doors soundtrack.    Ms. Knight and other National Park Service employees fought back by working throughout the winter to mount a fire exhibit here. They hope to counter the image of total destruction -- left by miles of video tape and doom-laden pronouncements from New York anchor desks -- with information conveying the message that fire isn't good or bad, it's simply part of a forest's natural life.    It's an uphill battle. The resulting special exhibit, &quot;Yellowstone and Fire,&quot; is a rush job, created in six months on a shoestring budget. What's more, it's tucked away in the small Grant Village information center on the eastern shore of Yellowstone Lake, a site visited by only about one in seven of those touring the park.    The main exhibit is supplemented by several roadside displays near burned areas, but they are limited to a few paragraphs and a picture or two. The roadside exhibits also aren't identified so that a driver can tell them apart from others focusing on the park's plant and animal life, or geology. And so well do the wood-mounted panels blend into their surroundings that you may not even spot them all; the map showing their location, handed out to visitors when they enter the park, is pretty sketchy. (Along with the map, each car also receives a Yellowstone Today newspaper containing a special fire supplement.)    This is too bad, because Yellowstone's roads are where the battle for the hearts and minds of the Disney-generation crowding station wagon back seats is being fought. The moment for the park service to make its case -- either through use of guides or more eye-catching graphics -- is when the kids shout &quot;awesome]&quot; &quot;rad]&quot; or &quot;gross]&quot; as the first fire-touched hillside swings into view.    But for now the bulk of the informational firepower is back at Grant Village. The exhibit there gets off to a strong start by fighting fire video with fire video. Every 15 minutes or so a small viewing room off one side of the central information area shows a film of forest-fire highlights that recently kept an audience of 40 sitting in awed silence, kids and all. A sonorous male voice describes the combination of persistent drought, lightning strikes and hurricane-force winds last summer that quickly fanned the fires out of control.    Most viewers seem to come away from the video agreeing that the fires of '88 weren't the park service's &quot;fault,&quot; regardless of the natural burn policy that initially allowed some lightning-caused fires to burn freely. (All fires are being suppressed this year while the fire policy is under review.) The video also gives firefighters credit for heroic, and successful, efforts to save most park structures, including the Old Faithful Inn and buildings in Grant Village, where fire came within a few feet of employee dormitories.    The main exhibit next door leads off by confronting visitors with the parched conditions that turned Yellowstone into a tinder box last year. A small, scorched lodgepole pine tree leans over a chart tracing the minuscule amount of rain that fell last summer, a period during which more than twice the average number of lightning strikes were also recorded. For instance this Aug. 10 more rain -- three to five inches -- fell on parts of the park in a single hour than during all of last summer.    Large color photo panels and supporting text describe the role fire plays in the lives of park plants and animals, with special attention paid to the lodgepole pine, the park's dominant evergreen species. Many of the lodgepole's cones are covered with a gluey tar that prevents the cone from dropping its tiny seeds until it's cooked to at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit by a passing blaze. The seeds are then fertilized by the ash of the burned parent trees, and the lodgepole life cycle continues.    Animals fared relatively well. Only a few hundred elk out of several thousand died in the fires. Those that perished provided a feast for the park's endangered grizzlies, who retired later than usual to their dens last winter, fat and happy.    A collection of firefighting gear, including a graffiti-inscribed helmet reading, &quot;Bambi is Alive,&quot; and a mural with press clippings about the fire, especially several from the Pulitzer Prize-nominated coverage of the Billings (Montana) Gazette, add a human dimension to the show.    As a supplement to the exhibit, ranger-led walks through burn areas ought to be on any visitor's must-do list, yet they aren't given any special prominence among the hodgepodge of announcements cluttering Yellowstone Today's pages. The park service plans a handful of self-guided walking and driving tours through burned areas, but they aren't expected to be open to the public before next July 1.    ----   Mr. McMurray is a Chicago-based Journal reporter who covered the fire last fall. </TEXT></DOC>
