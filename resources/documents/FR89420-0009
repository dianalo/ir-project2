The District's regulations areat least as stringent as corresponding Kentucky regulations. The District'sregulations are incorporated by the State as part of the Kentucky SIP;in this manner, the State has the authority to implement the regulationsin Jefferson County if the District cannot.The SIP revisions affected by today's approval were adopted by the AirPollution Control Board of Jefferson County on April 20, 1988, and submittedto EPA by Kentucky on January 19, 1989. The regulations being approvedby this notice are 3.05, Methods of Measurement, and 4.02, Episode Criteria.Regulation 3.05 establishes the methods to use for measuring air contaminants.This regulation was amended to correct references to federal regulations.With the adoption of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard for particulate, new methods and standards for measurementwere added to 40 CFR Parts 50 and 53 to ensure consistency of measurement.With the incorporation of PM<T2>10</T2> standards in the Jefferson County regulations, the methodsfor measurement logically followed. Regulation 4.02 establishes the criteria to determine air pollution episodes.This regulation was amended to drop TSP and add PM<T2>10</T2> in all three phases of the episode criteria such that alerts,warnings and emergencies reflect the concentration levels as set forthin 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix L. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective June 19, 1989 unless, within 30 days of itspublication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments willbe submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective June19, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is today finalizing approval of revisons to Regulation 3.05 and 4.02contained in Appendix N of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan. Theserevisions simply reflect the adoption of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard for particulates.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Park Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 19, 1989.
