RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A golf club that has counted presidents andmembers of Congress among its members failed today in a SupremeCourt bid to regain a tax break revoked because of the club'srefusal to admit women as members.   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that Marylandofficials did not violate the rights of Burning Tree Club membersby scraping a tax break worth more than $300,000 a year.   Burning Tree has 440 members and is located just outside thenation's capital in the affluent suburb of Bethesda, Md., The clubhad a long-term agreement with the state to preserve its openspaces in return for favorable property-tax treatment.   But in 1986, the Maryland Legislature canceled the agreement.The club, an all-male bastion since its founding in 1922, was toldit must either admit women or have its land taxed at full value.   Maryland officials also said the club's refusal to admit womenviolated the state's Equal Rights Amendment enacted in 1972.   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in March that a law forcingthe club to choose between admitting women or losing its tax breakdid not violate the members' freedom-of-association rights.   The law ``does not even prohibit Burning Tree fromdiscriminating,'' the state's highest court said. ``It simplyprovides that if Burning Tree continues to discriminate, itsproperty will be assessed in the same manner as the property ofother taxpayers in the area.''   Burning Tree officials argued their club should be exempt fromrecent Supreme Court rulings empowering government officials to endsex discrimination at such large, national organizations as theJaycees and Rotary Clubs.   Burning Tree's appeal said the club is a more intimate group andhas a limited purpose: providing a ``congenial'' setting for mendevoted to the game of golf.   The Maryland appeals court, however, ruled that the state isonly withdrawing a benefit, not forcing the club to accept women.   ``The state is simply declining to subsidize any organizationthat engages in discriminatory activities,'' the state court said.``Just because Burning Tree's members may have associational rightsdoes not oblige the state to subsidize the exercise of thoserights.''   A Supreme Court ruling in 1988 gave states and local communitiespower to ban sex and race bias at private clubs smaller than theJaycees and Rotary. The court upheld a New York City law banningdiscrimination by private clubs with more than 400 members.   Two justices who joined that unanimous opinion, Harry A.Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy, once belonged to male-only clubs.   The case is Burning Tree vs. Maryland, 88-1970.</TEXT></DOC>
