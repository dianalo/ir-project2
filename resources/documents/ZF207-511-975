 The answer is the age-old problem that besets thepioneer - it was too far ahead of the game: Apollo was founded two yearsbefore Sun, and its Domain networked workstations established a new market -but at that time, there was no head of steam behind Unix, and Apollo startedout with its own proprietary Aegis operating system and hit a serious hiatuswhen the burgeoning industry standardised on Unix; it lost time implementingits own version of Unix, while Sun had the percipience and luck, two yearslater, to settle on the Berkeley version of Unix from the beginning.andM;-  o  -andM;Is a counter-bid for Apollo likely?andP;  It the market thought so itandM;would have pushed Apollo's share price above the Hewlett-Packard offer priceon Wednesday - but the company certainly has attractions to its majorcustomer, ambitious Siemens AG, as we pointed out in January (CI No 1,096),Nixdorf Computer AG is also said to have taken a look, and Data General Corphas also reportedly made takeovertures, and Bull HN, NEC Corp and Sony Corpare all said to have taken a look.andM;-  o  -andM;In a hint that it may be prepared to up its $20 a share offer, MAIandM;Basic Four Inc yesterday asked Prime Computer Inc for confidential data,saying it is willing to enter into a &quot;reasonable&quot;

itsaid.andM;-  o  -andM;Asea Brown Boveri AG is to increase its stake in US chipmaker IXYSandM;Corp to 28% in a deal that sees the Swiss-Swedish company's Lampertheim, WestGermany semiconductor plant transferred to the US firm: the new ABB-IXYS Corpwill have annual sales of about $37m this year, and will employ 380 people.andM;-  o  -andM;Philips NV shareholders backed the board's takeover plan toandM;-  o  -andM;The US Federal Communications Commission has rejected ATandamp;T Co'sandM;preferential Tariff 12 plan, under which it provides customised packages oftelephone services to large companies, but will allow the firm to continueoffering the service to existing users provided it makes the special packagesand rates generally available to subscribers.andM;-  o  -andM;And ATandamp;T Co is offering bulk discounts for high-volume users ofandM;its inter-city digital leased lines, which range from 6% for people whocommit to a mimimum $25,000 a month over a year, to a full 40% for those whoexpect they'll spend $1m or more a month over five years.andP;

Edmonds, the New York law firm representing Hewlett-Packard Co inApple's copyright infringement lawsuit against Hewlett and Microsoft Corpasks &quot;How many different ways can you do that?&quot;andP;  Given all the electronicjunk that comes into the office every day, not to mention quite a bit createdhere, something bigger than a bin would be needed to cart it all away and ouricon would be a garbage truck.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
