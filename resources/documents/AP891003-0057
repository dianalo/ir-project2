Business Day, a Johannesburg daily, today described the talks asthe highest-level bargaining session ever held between thewhite-controlled government and major anti-apartheid activisits.   It quoted one unidentified activist as calling Monday's parley,in which the government offered to waive some unpaid rent, ``anunprecedented breakthrough'' because the activists were accepted asprimary negotiating partners.   The boycott has been one of the most effective protests byblacks since a national state of emergency was declared in June1986.   Soweto, home to an estimated 2.5 million blacks on the outskirtsof Johannesburg, has been the hardest-hit of several townshipsaffected by rent boycotts. It has lost more than $100 million inrevenue.   The government delegation, led by Transvaal Provinceadministrator Danie Hough, met in Pretoria with Soweto citycouncilors and prominent activists, including Anglican ArchbishopDesmond Tutu; the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of theSouth African Council of Churches; and Albertina Sisulu,co-president of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheidcoalition.   Hough said the activists ``have a very important role to play''_ an unusual government acknowledgement of the influence enjoyed bymilitant leaders within black communities. He said the delegationswould meet again.   The government could not accept demands to write off all unpaidrent, but a partial waiver could be negotiated, Hough said.   He offered to negotiate ways to transfer ownership of rentedhouses to their occupants, another demand of the activists.   Hough said a demand that Soweto and Johannesburg be unified toshare tax revenue was ``probably impractical.''   Chikane, the activists' spokesman, said the meeting showed that``we can resolve problems by talking rather than relegating thesolution to the police.''   Police have tried periodically to evict boycotters from theirhomes. One such campaign, in August 1986, led to confrontations inwhich more than 20 blacks were killed by police gunfire.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no votein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
