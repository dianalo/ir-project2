Oil futures prices sagged Thursday, pressured by fear that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might flood themarkets with more oil and bring about a price collapse.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,tumbled 38 cents to settle at $13.29 per barrel. The contract hadfallen 23 cents on Wednesday. Other contract months also declinedsharply Thursday, with next October's contract down 87 cents at$12.70.   Futures prices of refined products were lower across the board.The December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 45.65 cents agallon, down 0.85 cent from Wednesday's close.   The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which rose0.07 cent on Wednesday, fell 1.50 cents to close at 42.97 cents agallon.   Analysts said the market opened weakly, reflecting negativeinvestor reaction to threats by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC membersthat they would start dumping more oil on world markets if a quotaagreement among members was not reached.   Saudi Arabia produces just over half of its capacity ofapproximately 10 million barrels a day. Because of falling crudeprices its oil revenue has plunged.   The threats came as two OPEC committees began meeting Thursday inVienna to hammer out an accord that would limit production andbolster oil prices. Those talks will culminate with a meeting of all13 OPEC ministers starting Monday.   Analysts said prices weakened further shortly after the meetingconvened about 1 p.m. EST in response to a statement by Iraqi OilMinister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, who told reporters beforethe closed-door meeting began: ``It's very clear our position hasn'tchanged.''   The Iraqis have refused to abide by the cartel's quota system,which analysts have said is the biggest stumbling block to reachinga production accord.   Thursday's meeting adjourned late in the day without anyannouncements and the ministers were not expected to convene againformally until Saturday.   ``Having started out with negative news and not being given anypositive news during the day, the market sagged under thepressure,'' said Mary L. Haskins, assistant vice president at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   Overproduction has depressed the price of crude by more than 25percent in 1988 below OPEC's $18 a barrel benchmark price.   OPEC is estimated to be producing more than 21 million barrelsper day of oil and market analysts have said that the cartel mustcut back to around 17-18 million barrels to raise prices.</TEXT></DOC>
