In a previous edition the numbers were reported incorrectly. Also, Toyota Motor Corp. sold 86,743 cars in the U.S. last month, and Hyundai Motor Co. sold 25,119 cars. In the auto-sales table in an earlier edition, the August U.S. sales for both companies were estimated because neither reported actual totals.
