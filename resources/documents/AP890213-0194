GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On a continent where kings were oncerevered as gods, Asia's half-dozen surviving monarchies include adiverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolutepower.   King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world's longest reigningmonarch following the death Jan. 7 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, hasinitiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of eachyear in the countryside personally helping peasants to designirrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.   Aside from Thailand and Japan, monarchs also reign in Nepal andBhutan in the Himalayias, Brunei on Borneo, and Malaysia inSoutheast Asia.   Unlike his remote predecessors in Nepal, Harvard-educated KingBirendra criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal offulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year2000.   In the kingdom of Bhutan, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk pores overeconomic development plans and almost daily deals with petitionssubmitted by subjects.   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely creditedwith having helped Japan's postwar economic miracle by preservingnational unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after Japan'sdefeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on theChrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of Tokyo's Imperial Palace.   His son and successor, Emperor Akihito, 55, broke with traditionby marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with hisfellow Japanese at numerous public functions.   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers betweenemperor and subjects, Akihito is unlikely to interact as intimatelywith his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asianroyals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaininghereditary monarchs is Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, an absoluteruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the UnitedStates last year named him the world's richest man, with assetsestimated at $25 billion.   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister anddefense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinetto help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of Maryland onthe north coast of Borneo island.   Brunei's sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry andproclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of Asia as itsrice fields.   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communistrevolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Westerndemocracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.   The last emperor of China abdicated in 1912. Communists endedimperial rule in Vietnam at the end of World War II. India'sindependence from Great Britain in 1947 sounded the knell formyriads of royals. Cambodia's kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in1970, though Prince Norodom Sihanouk, formerly the king, is stillactive as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king ofAfghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, was toppled in 1973 and is exiledin Italy but recently offered to help in a transitional governmentin his country.   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms andMalaysia, where every five years one of the country's sultans iselected a constitutional monarch.   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have sultans who are constitutionalheads of the state governments. They have no political power. Everyfive years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one ofthemselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each stategets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At thenational level the king is the constitutional head of state butpolitical power rests with prime minister.   The present king of Malaysia is Sultan Mahmood Iskandar fromJahore state. His term expires this year.   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeablefutures appear secure.   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600years in Japan. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors asfigures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world'soldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favorits continuation.   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in Thailand, is heir to750 years of monarchy.   Bolkiah is Brunei's 29th ruler while Nepal and Bhutan both havecenturies-old royal traditions.   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king isregarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held thecountry together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs thathave marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a seriousstudent-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of nationalcrisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.   Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was ajazz-loving teen-ager, Bhumibol was initially viewed as someone tobe used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed thedecline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the eliteto work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.   Nepal's Birendra, 43, likewise has sought links with the ruralpoor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out reliefsupplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgablesources in Nepal and neighboring India say much of the effort isnegated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ anopen secret in Katmandu, the capital.   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-yearrule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limiteddemocratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of theHindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.   In Bhutan, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King Jigme SingyeWangchuk has continued his father's attempts at political evolutionand improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiteratepeople.   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and ourvalues is equally important,'' Jigme Singye has said.   Bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by hisreform-minded father.   International aid agencies have been welcomed to Bhutan but masstourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old waysupheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to foursisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.   Brunei's politics are said to be among the most sterile in Asiabut the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significantsigns of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the countrycontinues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medicalcare and education are free and the per capita annual income of$21,000 is among the highest in the world.   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and otherinvestments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and iscredited with a number of civic improvements.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 19</NOTE></DOC>
