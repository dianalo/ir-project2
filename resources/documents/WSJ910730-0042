The initiative, similar to a measure rejected by theSenate earlier this year, was hardly discussed yesterdayduring debate on the State Department's fiscal 1992authorization bill, which was approved on an 86-11 vote.</LP><TEXT>   One of the bill's provisions, backed by Sen. ChristopherDodd (D., Conn.), would establish a $1 billion military-salesprogram at the State Department. The legislation providesthat the program can be processed and routed through theEx-Im Bank but doesn't specify that it be limited to theexport-credit agency.   Although not prohibited from backing military salesinvolving major U.S. allies, the bank has traditionally shiedaway from the defense trade, focusing instead on non-militaryU.S. business.   In February, the Senate voted 48-47 against a morecontroversial Dodd proposal that would have established adefense credit program solely within the bank. Supporters ofsuch a program argue that U.S. defense contractors need atimely boost in an era of declining overall Pentagonspending.   Under the proposed State Department program, NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization countries, as well as Japan,Israel, Australia and New Zealand, would qualify for support.</TEXT></DOC>
