Further, revenues since the project wasplaced into commercial service have been sufficient to satisfy the repaymentto the Treasury of the United States, with interest, of all Federal fundsadvanced to the P-DP for the construction of the P-DP's features, includingthe assumed obligations of other electrical facilities associated withthe reclamation of lands and treaties of the United States with the Republicof Mexican States.In accordance with 10 CFR 903.23, the Administrator of Western has determined,on the basis that this action does not affect the existing rates, thata consultation and comment period is not needed, nor is there any needfor public information or comment forums. Notice of the proposed rate extensionwas published at 53 FR 48306, November 30, 1988. The extension of the existingrates is expected to be placed in effect on an interim basis on January1, 1989, by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy and will beforwarded to the FERC for approval on a final basis.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Washington, DC, December 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph F.

The Parker-Davis Project (P-DP) was formed by the consolidationof the two projects under the terms of the act of May 28, 1954 (68 Stat.143).Parker Dam, which creates the Lake Havasu Reservoir, is located on theColorado River between Arizona and California, 155 miles downstream fromHoover Dam. The dam was constructed by Reclamation, partially with fundsadvanced by the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of Southern California.Under contract, MWD is entitled to one-half of the net energy generated.Davis Dam, which creates the Lake Mohave Reservoir, is located on the ColoradoRiver between Arizona and Nevada, 67 miles downstream from Hoover Dam.The P-DP is operated in conjunction with other hydroelectric installationsin the Colorado River Basin.Construction of Parker Dam was authorized for the purpose of controllingfloods, improving navigation, regulating flow of the streams of the UnitedStates, providing for storage and delivery of the stored waters thereof,reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations, other beneficial uses,and the generation of electric energy as a means of financially aidingand assisting such undertakings.Davis Dam was constructed to provide reregulation for the fluctuating waterreleases from Lake Mead at Hoover Dam, from hourly to seasonal, to facilitatewater delivery for downstream irrigation requirements, for delivery ofwater beyond the boundary of the United States as required by the MexicanWater Treaty, and for the generation of electric energy as a means of financiallyaiding and assisting such undertakings.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>Power repayment studies (PRS) and other analyses indicate that the existingrates are sufficient to maintain the financial integrity of the P-DP, andwill provide sufficient revenues to recover all operation, maintenance,and replacement costs for the P-DP through the cost evaluation period endingSeptember 30, 1992. Further, revenues since the project was placed intocommercial service have been sufficient to satisfy the repayment to theTreasury of the United States, with interest, of all Federal funds advancedto the P-DP for the construction of the P-DP's features, including theassumed obligations of other electrical facilities associated with thereclamation of lands and treaties of the United States with the Republicof Mexican States.Operating revenues for fiscal year 1987 were approximately $24.2 million,while average estimated operating revenues for the first 5-future years(FY 1988-FY 1992) are approximately $20 million. Revenues are impactedby two factors: (1) The amount of sales (kWh) and (2) the rates for suchsales. Sales for fiscal years 1988 through 2008 (termination of currentcontracts) are based on firm power and transmission contractual commitments.The power and transmission rates now in effect are sufficient to recoverthe costs of producing and transmitting power and energy. Additionally,all federally funded construction of P-DP facilities has been recoveredwith appropriate interest.The PRS on which the rate extension is based differs in the treatment offuture replacements from the PRS on which the current rates are based.While the previous ratesetting PRS projected replacements for the entireterm of the study, the PRS for the rate extension projects replacementsfor the 5-future-year cost evaluation period only. Additionally, since1983, several events have occurred that are now reflected in the PRS preparedfor the rate extension. First, fuel replacement sales were made utilizingWestern's Boulder City Area Office's transmission system with the revenuesfrom those sales shared among projects. Secondly, the P-DP is repaid, inpart due to fuel replacement sales revenues as well as sales greater thanexpected resulting from surplus water. Lastly, surplus revenues are usedduring the 5-year cost evaluation period to repay budgeted investments,and thereafter are transferred to another project as required by law.Beginning in fiscal year 1983, revenues to the Boulder City Area resultingfrom the settlement of a joint intra-Western projects agreement (Salt LakeCity Area and Boulder City Area) have been allocated to both the P-DP andPacific Northwest-Pacific Southwest Intertie/Southern Division (Intertie).This has resulted in approximately 30 percent (30%), or $10,502,544, ofthe net revenues to the Boulder City Area being allocated to the Intertieand transferred in FY 1988. This allocation is predicated on the basisthat both the P-DP's and the Intertie's transmission systems are utilizedproportionately to effect economy energy transactions within the BoulderCity Area.The PRS utilizes budget data to project the first 5-future years of operation,maintenance, and replacement costs for both Reclamation and Western. TheFY 1992 operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) budget amount was reduced bythe amount of ``extraordinary Oandamp;M expenses'' to determine the FY 1993-FY2042 level of Oandamp;M costs. Budgeted replacement amounts were used inthe PRS for the cost evaluation period ending September 30, 1992 (FY 1992).Beginning in FY 1993, no further replacements costs are forecast throughthe end of the repayment analysis (FY 2042). Exclusion of future replacementscosts beyond the cost-evaluation period would prevent a presently unnecessaryrate increase for this project that has been repaid.Also, the PRS reflects, in FY 1993, a transfer of $5,464,601 to the LowerColorado River Basin Development Fund; from FY 1994 through FY 2004 anannual transfer of $2,727,936; and from FY 2005 through FY 2042 (end ofstudy) an annual transfer of $1,649,936. These transfers represent the``surpluses'' of revenues after all operation, maintenance, replacementcosts, and completion of repayment requirements for P-DP have been satisfied,and are required by section 403 of the Colorado River Basin Project Act,as amended.<ITAG tagnum="81">Order</ITAG>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy, I hereby confirm and approve for a period effectiveJanuary 1, 1989, a 5-year extension of existing Rate Schedules PD-F2, PD-FT2,PD-NFT2, and PD-FCT2 for wholesale firm power rates and the firm and nonfirmtransmission rates for Western's Parker-Davis Project.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, December 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph F.
