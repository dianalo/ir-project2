Reversing previous policy recommendations that advisedstricken African countries to reduce their dependence oncommodities, the report said it would cost billions ofdollars and be &quot;extremely difficult&quot; for the countries todiversify into manufacturing.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We studied the problem for a year, and despite worldcommodity price trends there just isn't any alternative,&quot;said Malcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister whochaired the UN Secretary-General's Expert Group on AfricanCommodities.   The study said African nations &quot;must use commodityproduction and trade as a motor for expansion.&quot; Commodityproduction and distribution should be privatized ordecentralized, it said, adding that local and foreigninvestment would improve transport, storage, agriculturalresearch and education facilities.   Producers would help counter commodity gluts by allowinglocal prices to fluctuate in line with international quotesand by cooperating with other African nations and consumers,the report said. Meanwhile, the U.S. and European countriesshould reduce barriers to African produce, Mr. Fraser added.   Africa's population will grow to about 740 million in 10years from 550 million at present, the report said. Yet debtshave surged to about $220 billion from $108 billion in 1980and economic growth has fallen. Africa is more dependent oncommodities as export income than any other region, thereport said, and raw materials normally account for about 90%of the total.   In 1988, commodities earned $18 billion for Africa, thestudy said, but adjusted for inflation that was 26% lowerthan in 1980 and 35% below 1970. The decline reflects lowerprice levels and a much smaller international market share.</TEXT></DOC>
