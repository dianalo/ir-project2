<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1019 </DOCNO><TEXT>Based on the intermediate interaction model, an approximate wave functionfor the entrance channel in the nucleon-nucleus reaction is derived.It is valid in the exterior region as well as the region near the nuclearsurface, and is expressed in terms of the wave function and reactancematrix of the optical model and of the near-resonance parameters. Usingthis formalism the following processes are calculated: 1) resonance averagedchannel radiative neutron capture cross section; 2) radiative capturein the inelastic channel of compound nucleus; 3) interference effectin the channel radiative neutron capture process; 4) laser induced neutronradiative capture reaction.</TEXT></DOC>
