The 67-year-old physicist and father of the Soviet dissidentmovement said political prisoners continue to languish in laborcamps while new laws have increased police powers and restrictedpublic demonstrations.   ``It seems to me that this is extremely dangerous and coulddestroy the process of perestroika (political and economicrestructuring) and turn it around,'' Sakharov said.   If Gorbachev's reforms do not succeed, he warned, ``Internalfailure could be accompanied by external expansion. For thepreservation of the system, expansion would be a necessity. ... Itwould be a catastrophe from which would arise a great threat to allhumanity.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York City on Monday began a pilot program tostem the spread of AIDS by providing drug addicts new hypodermicneedles in exchange for their used ones.   Although the program aimed at reducing needle sharing amongaddicts is intended to serve as many as 200 intravenous drugabusers, by early afternoon no applicant had appeared at HealthDepartment headquarters in lower Manhattan.   ``Today, we're going to have only a handful,'' said the healthcommissioner, Dr. Stephen Joseph. ``We're going to build slowly up''over a period of weeks or months, he predicted.   Under the $240,000 program, which has drawn heated oppositionfrom conservatives and some minority group organizations, addictsalso will receive counseling on AIDS and drugs. Another 200 addictswill receive only counseling; over time, their rate of infectionwill be compared with the infection rate of those receiving needles.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   The government amnesty program for illegal immigrants entered itssecond phase Monday, but turnout was light on the first day thosewho took advantage of the program could begin applying for permanentresidency.   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials expectabout 1.5 million of the 1.8 million non-agricultural amnestyapplicants to apply for permanent residency. Most are from LatinAmerica.   Permanent resident status brings a person a so-called green card_ they've actually been white since 1976 _ which allows them toleave and enter the country at will and to eventually apply forcitizenship.   Amnesty recipients who apply for permanent residency must eithertake a 60-hour English and civics class from an INS-certified schoolor pass an oral and written test similar to the citizenship testgiven to permanent residents who enter this country legally.</TEXT></DOC>
