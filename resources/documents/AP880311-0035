Carlucci.   Reagan would veto the bill because he believes it isunconstitutional, the defense secretary said Thursday in testimonybefore a House Intelligence subcommittee. He added that enactmentof the measure over Reagan's objection would touch off anotherfight similar to the ongoing dispute over the War Powers Act.   The War Powers Act, a 1973 law restricting a president'sauthority to send U.S. troops into dangerous situations, is thesubject of a federal court fight over its constitutionality. TheWhite House claims it is unconstitutional.   The intelligence notification bills arise from the Iran-Contraaffair, when U.S. weapons were secretly sold to Iran and some ofthe profits were diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas.Reagan withheld notification from Congress for 10 months in 1986.   Current laws require that Congress be told about covert actionsexcept in extraordinary circumstances, when only ``timely notice''is required. But the phrase is not defined and the proposedlegislation would mandate notice within 48 hours.   Carlucci, who was Reagan's national security adviser after theIran-Contra affair became public, said the administration has putprocedures into place to avoid another Iran-Contra situation.   ``At some point, we have to rely on trust,'' he told thelegislation subcommittee. ``If a future president sets out todeceive a Congress, no amount of statutes will stop him.''   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the bill is ``one more battlebetween the imperial Congress and the imperial presidency.''   Carlucci agreed, saying, ``I can think of no step by theCongress which would do more harm to the process of rebuilding anatmosphere of trust and candor between the branches thanunilaterally to lay claim to prerogatives which the presidentfirmly believes are vested in the executive by the Constitution.''   But Rep. Matt McHugh, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, saidthe legislation is needed.   ``In the case of the arms sales to Iran, the president construedcurrent law as permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10months after the covert sales had been authorized,'' McHugh said.   ``If he had done (as the law generally requires), he wouldsurely have heard some strong objections and might have spared thecountry a serious foreign policy setback and himself a majorpolitical embarrassment.''   Carlucci's argument was that ``the failures of the Iran affairwere human and managerial. No statute can prevent these mistakes.... We will not put the mistrust which caused the Iran-Contraaffair behind us until we trust each other again.''   The bill was also opposed by Brent Scowcroft, national securityadviser to President Ford.   Scowcroft said ``the excessively restrictive language proposedseems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath. It is notpossible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the executivewithout at the same time paralyzing the ability to act.''   He said the bills arise from the view that notification toCongress about the arms sales would have been met with oppositionthat would have derailed the plan.   Scowcroft disputed that. ``There is no evidence to support thisassumption. Indeed, as it was, the president was confronted, by hisprincipal advisers, with views strongly in opposition to theIranian arms sales.''</TEXT></DOC>
