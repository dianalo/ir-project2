No matter what the self-styled Democratic convention powerbrokers say.   And it may mean that Jesse Jackson, the biggest surprise of theyear, has peaked halfway through the primary and caucus season.   In another time, a solid Democratic regular like Dukakiscarrying blue-collar Wisconsin might not seem like much. But by thereckoning in use for the unpredictable 1988 campaign, Dukakisscored several important successes in a single Tuesday night:   _ He won a state he had to win, by more than anyone expected,and at the moment of Jesse Jackson's greatest momentum. In anyother year, Jackson's showing would have been spectacular. But thisweek, basking in the glow of his stunning Michigan caucus victory,pictured on the cover of Time and Newsweek, drawing boisterouscrowds from one town to the next, he could not match theexpectations that had been set for him.   _ Dukakis probably succceeded in winnowing the field as well,with Sen. Paul Simon expected to suspend active campaigning laterthis week. That will mean one less white candidate to siphon offwhite votes in future primaries in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio,where Jackson's black constituency is substantially larger than itwas in Wisconsin.   _ He benefited from Sen. Albert Gore's failure to emerge as astrong challenger in the race. Gore was gaining less than 20percent of the vote, far behind Jackson, and now has failed utterlyin a month-long bid to turn his Super Tuesday victories intosuccess outside the South. Already, Dukakis' aides are trying toundermine Gore's campaign in New York, raising questions about thelarge loans he is relying on.   _ Dukakis' victory should reassure the party leaders who werebeginning to wonder if a son of New England would ever be able tocarry one of the Great Lakes industrial states. That, in turn,should put a damper on the incessant talk of drafting Mario Cuomointo the Democratic race _ and increase the odds that Cuomo willlend his support.   And along the same lines, Dukakis has been working the phones,hoping a victory in Wisconsin might set off a movement of partyleaders, members of Congress and governors to his side. Not so muchbecause they are enamored of him _ they are not _ but because he istheir best chance to stop Jackson, who they fear would lead theparty to the defeat of a lifetime if he won the nomination and ledthe ticket against George Bush this fall.   None of this is to say that Dukakis is now the inevitablenominee. He tried to portray himself that way a few weeks ago, andit almost made him the inevitable governor of Massachusetts throughthe end of his term in 1990. He campaigned lackadaisically,seemingly worried more about collecting endorsements than votes _and finished third in Illinois before being buried under Jackson'slandslide in Michigan.   And in a year in which Gary Hart dropped out of the race twice,in which the much-sought after Iowa caucus prize proved worthlittle to winner Richard Gephardt and in which Jackson has brokennew ground, Dukakis may yet have to fend off a charge or two beforethe nomination can be his.   Still, Dukakis demonstrated not only that he could win thisweek, but that he could do so on his own terms.   Under pressure from party officials to do something _ anything _to regroup and stop Jackson, he gambled that he could do so withoutassaulting him and driving away the black votes so essential to ageneral election victory.   When he offered criticism, he did cautiously, as when he said itwas a ``bad idea'' for his rival to become involved in Panama _ butthen quickly added that Jackson had issued a clarification of hisown position.   Instead, he attacked the Reagan administration sharply inspeeches and in a new television commercial that evoked images ofhuman suffering in the era of Ronald Reagan.   ``This administration has walked away from the American dream.They've walked away from the basic contract that says if you workhard and pay your taxes and live within the law, you have a rightto a good job; and the right to a life where you don't have to goto bed every night worried about whether that job will still bethere in the morning,'' he said in a Milwaukee speech.   More than that, he allowed his staff to schedule him into moreinformal settings, serving lunch to senior citizens at one stop andvisiting children in a hospital in another.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: David Espo covers the presidential campaign forThe Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
