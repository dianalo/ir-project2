It is detectedthat in 36% of sample 1 disturbances and in 50% of sample 2 ones D/subst/-variation had a classical form: a clearly expressed initial phase,a sharp and deep main phase and a less sharp recovery phase which isoften close to exponent. In other cases reduced D/sub st/ forms, characterisedby a weak development or absence of the main phase were observed. Thereexist four of these forms. Parallel survey of dozens of M-disturbanceshas shown that they possess the same reduced D/sub st/ forms, but theclassical form does not occur at all. A conclusion is drawn that thepresence of classical D/sub st/ form in geomagnetic disturbance is asufficient base for its reference to sporadic ones.</TEXT></DOC>
