In Beirut, sniper fire exchanges along the city's dividing GreenLine claimed the first combat fatality since an ArabLegaue-brokered truce halted six months of bloodshed on Sept. 22.   Police said 1st Lt. Abdul-Rahman Aslan, a Shiite Moslem, waskilled and three soldiers were wounded in a clash between Maj. Gen.Sami Khatib's Moslem troops and Christian army units in the Chiyahdistrict.   The casualties brought the overall toll to 930 killed and 2,744wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between theChristians and an alliance of Syrian troops and their Moslem allies.   Conference sources in Taif, speaking on condition of anonymity,said that hard-line Christian lawmakers were backing away somewhaton their demand that Syrian forces withdraw before Christians agreeto political reforms in Lebanon.   They said the lawmakers conceded that an immediate Syrianwithdrawal would allow Moslem militias to take control of Moslemregions now controlled by the Syrians.   The sources also said that a committee working on a draftproposal for political reforms has completed its recommendations onthe future powers of the president, traditionally a MaroniteCatholic.   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, formed thecommittee of seven Christians and seven Moslems on Monday to speedup work toward a settlement. By today, the committee had beenenlarged to 18 members.   Under the proposed reforms the president would continue to havethe right to summon Cabinet sessions. He also will be able todecree special amnesties, but not general ones as before.   Parliament bills will automatically become law if not ratifiedby the president within 15 days. Previously, no law could takeeffect unless endorsed by the president.   Moslems have been demanding that presidential powers becurtailed as part of a political reforms agreement that would givethem an equal share of power with the Christians.   Christians, then considered the majority, have dominated thegovernment, Parliament and judiciary since independence from Francein 1943. But Moslems now are believed to make up a majority of thepopulation.   A three-man Arab League committee had presented the 63Parliamentarians gathered in Taif with a draft peace plan. Thelegislators have been studying the proposal since Sept. 30 andmaking their own recommendations.   The main obstacle that has threatened to undermine the peaceconference was Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon.   The Arab committee has proposed a phased Syrian withdrawal fromthe Beirut area to be completed in two years, with total pulloutdepending on Israel ending its occupation of south Lebanon and theconclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact.   The Christian legislators' consent that an uncalculated Syrianwithdrawal would spur more turmoil has raised speculation that acompromise was in the works, possibly based on narrowing thetwo-year period for a withdrawal from Beirut that was envisaged bythe Arab committee.</TEXT></DOC>
