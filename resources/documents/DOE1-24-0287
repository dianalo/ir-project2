From the rates of removalof the various fractions a simple model for the biodegradation processesis proposed and verified with respect to acetic acid production and utilization,and total suspended solids removal. The process is initiated by enzymicdegradation of the substrate microbe cell walls followed by growth onthe released soluble substrates at low dissolved oxygen concentrationwith concommitant carboxylic acid production. Subsequent utilizationof the unbranched, lower molecular weight carboxylic acids allows additionalenergy supply following exhaustion of the easily utilisable soluble substratefrom microbial cell hydrolysis.</TEXT></DOC>
