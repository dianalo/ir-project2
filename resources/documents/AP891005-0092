At a two-minute private hearing at the High Court, action wasformally dropped against Peter Marsh, who owns Bilbo's Bookshop inBath. The attorney general will pay Marsh's $2,760 legal costs.   The attorney general's office said the public interest no longerrequired the case against Marsh to be pursued.   Last year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservativegovernment lost a three-year court battle to ban the book by PeterWright, who worked for Britain's MI5 intelligence service from 1955to 1976.   The government banned the book because it said Wright hadviolated an MI5 agreement to never reveal his activities in theagency.   Marsh said he felt he had taken a stand for freedom. He soldcopies of ``Spycatcher'' printed in the United States and Ireland,risking an unlimited fine and a two-year jail term for contempt ofcourt.   ``I am happy they have got egg on their faces,'' he said. ``Theyhave not dropped the action out of any spirit of clemency butbecause the consequences if they had tried to proceed would havebeen disastrous. Even if they had sent me to prison, they wouldstill have lost.''</TEXT></DOC>
