In addition, the CBT has submitted proposed amendmentsto this Treasury note futures contract. The amendments would change theeligibility standards for deliverable Treasury notes so that only threerecently issued two-year notes would be deliverable, decrease the contractsize to $200,000 from $400,000 face value, allow for futures trading duringan evening session, and increase the speculative limits for the contractto 5,000 contracts from 1,000 contracts in the spot month and in all futurescombined. The amendments also would increase the daily price limit to onepoint from three-fourths of a point, change the delivery procedures toconform to those currently in effect for the CBT's actively traded Treasurybond and Treasury note futures contracts, and revise the trading monthlisting provisions. Finally, the CBT proposes to change the name of thecontract to ``Short Term Treasury Notes (2 years).''In accordance with section 5a(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and actingpursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, theActing Director of the Division of Economic Analysis of the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission (``Commission'') has determined, on behalf of the Commission,that the proposal is of major economic significance and that, accordingly,publication of the proposal is in the public interest, will assist theCommission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistentwith the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested persons should submit their views and commentsto Jean A.

Under Regulation 5.2, an exchangemust submit for Commission review and approval, pursuant to section 5a(12)of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act) and CFTC Regulation 1.41(b), an appropriateby law, rule, regulation or resolution to recommence trading in a dormantcontract. Accordingly, the Exchange has submitted, pursuant to section5a(12) of the Act and Commission Regulation 1.41(b), a proposal to listadditional months in the contract.With regard to the proposal to recommence trading in the contract, theCBT noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the level of issuance of (two-year) Treasury notes has beenconsistently high over the past few years. The dealers and investors inthese issues would be well served by the availability of a viable and liquidhedging and price discovery vehicle.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The re-launched contract will become a reliable and useful hedgingand pricing instrument, with the potential to serve the financial marketsas the present bond and medium and long term note futures contracts alreadydo. Almost 66% of the long open interest and 55% of the short open interestin CBOT Treasury bond futures at the end of November 1988 was held by commercialtraders. In long term Treasury notes, 82% and 63% of the long and shortopen interests, respectively, were held by commercials. Similarly, in 5-yearnote futures both long and short open interest held by commercials exceeded85%. The relaunched contract is likely to develop the same high level ofcommercial hedging interest.</ITAG>In addition, as noted above, the Exchange has submitted for Commissionapproval proposed changes to the standards for deliverable notes, the contractsize, speculative limits, daily price limits, delivery procedures, tradingmonths, and the name of the contract. With respect to the proposal to specifythat only recently issued two-year Treasury notes (the three most recentissues) be deliverable, rather than allowing the delivery of any Treasurynote or bond with a remaining maturity of not less than one year, ninemonths and not more than two years, the CBT stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes * * * will alter the essential nature of thecontract by focusing the futures contract on the two year issue. The earlierincarnation of this contract was subject to variable pricing because otherissues of longer term maturities were permitted in deliveries. With a wideselection of issues * * * each with its own conversion factor, the contractwas susceptible to pricing an otherwise little followed older note or bond.The proposed changes will eliminate that problem. * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a hedging vehicle with distinct pricing, two year note futureswill be an important hedging tool not only for the large issuances of twoyear notes that also for old longer maturity Treasury instruments. Likewise,corporate borrowings in this maturity range will be easily hedged in theshort term Treasury note futures contract. Additionally, with its generallylow implied duration, short term Treasury note futures will at times bean attractive hedging tool for dealers and holders of seasoned securitiesof all types.</ITAG>The Commission is seeking comment on the CBT's proposal to recommence tradingin the contract and with respect to the proposed amendments.The materials submitted by the Exchange in support of the proposed amendmentsmay be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR 145(1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOIA,Privacy and Sunshine Acts Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariatat the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8.Any person interested in submitted written data, views or arguments onthe proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary,Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DCby the specified date.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on May 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
