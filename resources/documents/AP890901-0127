(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A starving teen-ager rescued from a mobilehome told authorities that her mother beat her, tied her up withropes and put chicken wire over the windows to keep her imprisoned,police said Friday.   Betty Faye Green, 18, weighed 42 pounds and was too weak to walkwhen she was admitted to Tift General Hospital on Wednesday, policesaid. She was listed in stable condition Friday.   Four younger children appeared to be healthy.   Their mother, Ola Mae Thomas of Tifton, was arrested Wednesdayand charged with false imprisonment and aggravated battery. She wasin the Tift County Jail awaiting bond Friday.   Detective Mitch Williams said police found the 4-foot-11 Ms.Green when they were summoned to the mobile home by a social worker.   He said police found chicken wire over all the home's windows andropes on the doors that could be used to tie them shut.   The teen-ager's room was empty of furniture, he said.   ``There were no fans, there was nothing in the room, not even alight bulb,'' he said. ``She had bruises and scars and she had somerope burns on both wrists. She told us her mother had been tying herup. There was a rope outside the door.''   Detective Buddy Dowdy said Ms. Thomas' four other children, ages9 and younger, appeared to be healthy and in excellent physicalcondition. They have been placed in foster homes.   Dowdy said there was plenty of food in the home, but itapparently was mostly withheld from the teen-ager. He said he didnot know why.   ``She was denied access to food,'' he said. ``She spent most ofher time bound or locked in her room.''   Williams said the mobile home's toilet was inoperative but wasstill being used. Investigators at first ``thought somebody was deadin the bathroom because it smelled so bad,'' he said.   Hospital spokeswoman Valerie Hall declined to discuss Ms. Green'sprognosis Friday and said the hospital would not allow her to beinterviewed ``for her protection and her recovery.''   Assistant District Attorney Ronald Adams said no hearing had yetbeen scheduled for Ms. Thomas, who could be sentenced to 30 years inprison if convicted of the felony charges.   A neighbor, Betty Moore, said she had not seen Ms. Green sincethe first of the year, but the four other children were clean andneatly dressed Monday when they left for the first day of school inthe southern Georgia town of 14,000.   Other neighbors said Ms. Thomas often cursed her children loudlyand seldom left the mobile home on Tifton's impoverished south side.   ``From six o'clock in the morning until late at night, when herman came home, she was steadily cussing the children,'' said OdellMoore, Mrs. Moore's husband.   The neighbors said Ms. Thomas' boyfriend or husband had beenliving at the mobile home for at least three years.   A social worker who had helped one of Ms. Thomas' children withacademic problems for the past year did not see Ms. Green at thehome during an April visit and was told by Ms. Thomas that she wasaway, said Department of Family and Children's Services DirectorRodney Griffin.   In May, the social worker noticed Ms. Green had lost too muchweight, he said. He said Ms. Green and Ms. Thomas both said the girlwas fine and refused hospital treatment.   Griffin said the social worker again tried to get the daughter toa doctor on Wednesday, but Ms. Thomas ordered her out of the house.She returned with police.   Ms. Thomas told police she is 27, saying she was 9 years old whenMs. Green was born. Dowdy said police believe she was 13 at the timeof her daughter's birth.</TEXT></DOC>
