Da Puzzo of Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc.   He isn't a powerful investment banker. Nor is he the sortof swaggering, behind the-scenes bond trader involved in theTreasury-auction scandal at Salomon Brothers Inc. The50-year-old Mr. Da Puzzo, a veteran stock trader, isShearson's best known commentator on over-the-counter stocksand small investors. During the 1987 crash, his OTC stockdepartment won praise for staying active while other firmsfroze. When Shearson promoted Mr. Da Puzzo last year toco-head of global stock trading, it called him among thefirm's &quot;most capable managers.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But last week, Mr. Da Puzzo's 33-year career -- which hadsurvived nine mergers and numerous resignations of executivesaround him -- took a devastating turn. Shearson suspended Mr.Da Puzzo and a top trader under him, Manny Geronimos, amidallegations that one or both manipulated the price of aShearson-led stock offering for ConAgra Inc. The suspensionwas made shortly after Mr. Da Puzzo pleaded his innocence ina three-hour session with company lawyers. &quot;There's nomotivation. There's no reason to do it,&quot; he is said to havepleaded.   An investigation by the New York Stock Exchange continues.Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., asked Big Boardregulators to accelerate the probe to try to avoid aprotracted scandal at the firm, which has been buffeted withbad news for several years.   Yet even if Mr. Da Puzzo is cleared of ordering themanipulation, the exchange is likely to slap him with atleast a &quot;failure-to-supervise&quot; disciplinary action and apossible suspension from the securities industry.   Mr. Da Puzzo's suspension by Shearson &quot;was a considerableshock,&quot; says William Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex.Brown andamp; Sons Inc. and chairman of a National Association ofSecurities Dealers advisory committee. &quot;During the late1980s, he was a very eloquent and often-seen and quotedspokesman for our industry. I was very surprised&quot; by thesuspension.   &quot;I thought he was a cut above the others,&quot; adds Robert J.Flaherty, whose traders' magazine, then called OTC Review,named Mr. Da Puzzo &quot;OTC Man of the Year&quot; for 1988. &quot;Hehandled the October 1987 crash with tremendous grace.&quot;   Mr. Da Puzzo denies doing anything wrong. Through hislawyer, he says that he &quot;acted properly at all times&quot; and hasbeen cooperating with the probes. Mr. Geronimos, the head ofinstitutional block trading under Mr. Da Puzzo, also says heis cooperating and &quot;looks forward to this being resolved.&quot;   Shearson's trading desk in the American Express tower ofthe World Financial Center was in a state of shock last weekwhen the suspensions were announced. More than one tradercried. The immediate question was: If Shearson did indeedmanipulate ConAgra's offering, did Mr. Da Puzzo give theorder?   The background of Mr. Da Puzzo, who makes more than $1million a year and sometimes $2 million in a good year,suggests that it would be out of character to flout therules. He cares about his public image and hasn't had anymajor disciplinary case against him in recent years. But hecan make impulsive decisions. He has always been eager toprove he's not just an over-the-counter stock salesman, but atop-notch trader of major stocks. He used to tell friendsthat one of his proudest moments on Wall Street was workingthe phones all weekend to show his bosses he could sell off abig block of stock first thing Monday.   The ConAgra offering last November was to have been aproud moment for Mr. Da Puzzo and Shearson's newlyreconstituted Lehman Brothers investment-banking and tradingoperation. The underwriting business was dead. The4.4-million ConAgra deal was the first major stock offeringsince the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in early August. Shearsontraders spent all day lining up buyers at the then-prevailingprice of $33.25 a share.   Suddenly, just on the close of the New York StockExchange, another firm put through a trade at $33.375, 12.5cents higher than the price at which ConAgra shares hadhovered consistently. Shearson traders were so angry that thefirm called Big Board President Richard Grasso to complainthat another brokerage firm must have tried to derailShearson's transaction.   Meanwhile, Shearson had a tough time explaining to ConAgrathat it would still prefer to sell the shares at the expected$33.25-a-share. The higher price would raise another $550,000or so for ConAgra, but at the expense of aggravating biginvestors in the company's shares, Shearson explained.   What happened next, of course, is the big question.Whoever ordered it, Shearson lawyers say that another trade-- at the original price of $33.25 a share -- was executed onthe Pacific Stock Exchange in the half-hour period when thatWest Coast market stayed open after New York closed.Shearson, satisfied, then went ahead and priced the offeringat $33.25 a share. (As it happens, the Pacific-exchange tradewas executed badly and eventually was voided, and in JanuaryShearson &quot;refunded&quot; the $550,000 to ConAgra.)   Mr. Da Puzzo is an energetic man who &quot;likes everything togo right,&quot; says a friend. Though they find it hard to believehe would break the rules, they have no doubt he was upset byseeing the last-minute trade. They also stress that orderingan improper &quot;offsetting&quot; trade would have beenuncharacteristically stupid for Mr. Da Puzzo.   As it happens, the Pacific-exchange trade looked sosuspicious that the Big Board opened an investigation lastDecember. Shearson executives say that the issue seemed tohave gone away in recent months, until a lower-level Shearsonemployee disclosed to the firm in August that she gotinstructions to place the trade on the Pacific exchange. Sucha trade could violate exchange rules against artificiallyaffecting the price of stock offerings. Worried about thecriticism Salomon Brothers suffered for failing to actquickly when confronted with wrongdoing, Shearson suspendedMr. Da Puzzo and his assistant while investigators determinewho gave the order.   There is already some finger-pointing going on amongsupporters of Mr. Da Puzzo and supporters of Mr. Geronimos;some of the latter say Mr. Geronimos -- eager to be a teamplayer -- could only have ordered the trade on instructionsfrom Mr. Da Puzzo.   It would be ironic if the Shearson debacle arose frommiscommunication or misguided ideas about &quot;team play&quot; on thehighly charged trading floor. A few months before the ConAgraoffering, Mr. Da Puzzo was the cover story in Shearson'sinternal magazine. &quot;Successful trading is a product of thepeople who trade,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;My most valuableassets walk in the door at 8 a.m. each day.&quot;   Later in the story, Mr. Da Puzzo recounts his fast-movingearly days in the OTC department at Loeb Rhoades, a Shearsonpredecessor firm. At 19 years old, he began filling in forsenior traders when they took vacations. At 20, he was soanxious to become a registered &quot;market maker&quot; in the stocksthat he almost couldn't take it anymore. Held back by a legalrequirement that market makers be at least 21, &quot;I was jumpingout of my skin&quot; having to wait, Mr. Da Puzzo said.</TEXT></DOC>
