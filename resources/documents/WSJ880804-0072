Mr. Reagan, whose veto message included themes Vice President Bush is using in his presidential campaign, particularly complained that the bill would slash funding for space-based parts of the Strategic Defense Initiative.    &quot;The bill would signal a basic change in the future direction of our national defense -- away from strength and proven success and back toward weakness and accommodation,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    Mr. Bush had publicly called for a veto of the defense bill, which Democrats seized on as proof that the veto was politically motivated to help the Bush campaign press its charges of Democratic weakness on defense.    The bill's congressional supporters conceded they don't have enough votes to override the veto, and probably don't have enough time to pass a new authorization measure for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Instead, the Pentagon budget is likely to be set in the defense-appropriations bill, on which Democrats will try to attach policy provisions from the vetoed bill. An authorization bill defines programs the government can carry out and sets funding ceilings, while an appropriations bill allocates money.    In an indication of the defense bill's important political symbolism, Mr. Reagan decided to veto it even though there was virtually no disagreement with Congress on its total price tag of $299.6 billion. Even some leading Republican senators and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci favored signing the measure, despite the administration's unhappiness about the bill's SDI provisions and a cut in funding for a plan to put MX missiles on railroad cars, congressional aides said.    But other influential Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, had argued strongly for a presidential veto. They believe that Republicans can portray the defense bill as a preview of the &quot;weaker&quot; defense policies that would be instituted by Michael Dukakis, the Democrats' presidential nominee. Mr. Bush, who is certain to become the Republican presidential nominee in two weeks, will find the veto a particularly useful tool in making his argument that there are significant differences between his defense policies and those of his Democratic foe.    Mr. Dukakis strongly opposes SDI, and doesn't favor the MX or Midgetman nuclear missiles, which also were the subjects of intense wrangling during debate on the defense bill. Mr. Bush, who once seemed to favor slowing the pace of the SDI program, has grown increasingly outspoken in his support of the missile-defense program in recent weeks, and supports both the MX and Midgetman missiles.    Democrats are likely to counter Republican charges of weakness by making Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn a high-profile defender of the bill. The Georgia senator is widely regarded as the Democrats' leading specialist on defense measures, and even Republicans consider him tough-minded on national security.    And they will try to turn the coming defense debate to their advantage by stressing the Republicans' biggest embarrassment in this area: the Pentagon procurement scandal that has broken out during the Reagan administration.    In the provision that most rankled the White House, the defense bill would deeply cut funds for space-based defense systems, while mandating higher spending levels for ground-based parts of President Reagan's proposed SDI missile-defense shield.    Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has boasted that this provision &quot;takes the stars out of 'Star Wars.'&quot; Democrats argue that such a shift in the SDI program would lessen the chances of an expensive race in space with the Soviets and help preserve the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.    Mr. Reagan also objected to changes the bill would have required in his strategic modernization program. The measure earmarked $250 million for a new system of basing MX missiles on mobile railroad cars, down from the $793 million the administration requested.    At the same time, the bill increased funding for development of the single-warhead Midgetman missile, a smaller missile popular with many congressional Democrats, to $250 million from the $200 million the adminstration requested. And it would have put $250 million in escrow until the next president decides whether to pursue the MX or Midgetman programs.    Mr. Reagan also protested the bill's requirement that the Navy mothball two Poseidon ballistic-missile submarines earlier than the administration planned, a step designed to keep the U.S. in compliance with the unratified SALT II strategic-arms treaty.    Mr. Carlucci favored signing the bill, though, because it also contained a 4.1% military pay raise the Pentagon wants badly, congressional aides said.    Sen. Nunn told reporters that proponents of the vetoed bill might try to attach its policy language to the defense appropriations bill. Alternatively, Sen. Nunn said, he might try to attach the language of the Senate's version of the defense-authorization bill to the appropriations bill. The White House has said it found the Senate's version of the authorization bill more acceptable than the final version, which emerged from a conference between the House and Senate. </TEXT></DOC>
