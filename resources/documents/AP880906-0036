The long-delayed agreement, signed in this tiny community 200miles south of the Arctic Circle on the shores of Great Slave Lake,will give the Denes and Metis Indian nations nearly 4,000 squaremiles of land and special rights to an area the size of Oklahoma.   Mulroney said the signing marked a ``day of justice'' andheralds ``new economic and political development'' for the north.But native leaders say many specifics must be negotiated before afinal pact is signed in two years.   Monday's agreement gives about 15,000 natives of the Dene andMetis Indian nations ownership and oil and mineral rights to about3,850 square miles of the rocky bush land bordering the ArcticOcean.   It would also give them special rights and interests _ includinga voice in wildlife, forestry and land management _ for a nearly70,000 square miles area.   The agreement, which followed 15 years of negotiations, includesa $405 million cash settlement that would be paid out over 20 yearsbeginning in 1990 _ the year negotiators hope to have a finalsettlement.   ``This agreement of principle, when carried forward to its finalform, will establish a new, stronger and healthier relationshipbetween the people of this area and the governments which servethem,'' said Mulroney, who was welcomed with the beat of drums anda ceremonial prayer chant.   He added that the agreement marks ``real progress'' in the Denequest for self-determination.   But the chief of the Dene nation warned that Ottawa and nativeleaders must still negotiate issues such as aboriginal title andself-government.   ``We will be seeking changes before we reach the finalagreement,'' Bill Erasmus told about 1,000 Dogrib Indians on thesteps of the village's Roman Catholic church.   The Dogribs are the largest of seven groups making up the Denenation.   Ottawa said the Dene handed over their aboriginal rights whenthey signed 1899 and 1921 treaties.   But the Dene contend they never gave up their aboriginal rightsand, under Monday's agreement, are handing over some of their landin return for financial compensation and the guarantee of huntingand fishing rights.   Mike Paulette, president of the Northwest Territories MetisAssociation, said he was sure ``we can now negotiate a satisfactorydeal within the next two years.''   Mulroney's visit to Rae-Edzo, 65 miles northwest of theterritorial capital of Yellowknife, marked his first trip to theNorthwest Territories since his Conservatives gained power fouryears ago.</TEXT></DOC>
