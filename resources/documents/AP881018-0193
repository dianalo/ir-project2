(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eleven Soviet inspectors watched Tuesday asU.S. military personnel using handheld power saws began thehistoric destruction of Air Force cruise missiles under theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.   Led by Army Major Gen. Vladimir Medvedev, the Soviets arrived atDavis-Monthan Air Force Base to watch 41 ground-launched cruisemissiles, 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons and seventransporter erector launchers be cut in half over the next few days.   ``The INF treaty is one of the most critical steps in thedirection of ending the Cold War,'' Medvedev said after thedestruction started. ``What we saw today was a critical step inthat direction.''   The Soviets, who flew from Travis Air Force Base near SanFrancisco aboard an Air Force C-141 Starlifter, were met by a U.S.delegation headed by Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of theDefense Department's On-Site Inspection Agency.   ``What we saw today should generate more confidence andpredictability in our relations,'' Lajoie told reporters after thefirst missile was destroyed.   The destruction started with several Air Force personnel cuttinginto a missile and an aluminum canister with handheld power saws.The missile was a 21-foot device built in 1986 by theMcDonnell-Douglas Astronautics Co., flight-tested at the Army'sDougway Proving Ground in Utah and deployed at an Air Force stationin Sicily before being shipped to Davis-Monthan in February.   Soviet inspectors and U.S. personnel sat on nearby bleachers asthey watched the work, which produced loud noise and acrid smellsas the saws cut through into metal. Fire extinguishers werepositioned near the workers.   Also slated for destruction was a 56-foot, 78,000-pound launcher.   Nuclear warheads, fuel and guidance-related equipment have beenremoved from each weapon, and the warheads have been returned tothe Department of Energy, which stores American nuclear weapons,said Capt. Kendell Pease, an OSIA spokesman.   Soviet inspectors have made two previous visits to the UnitedStates under the treaty, once in July and again in August. They arebeing escorted during their stay by 22 officials from Davis-Monthanand the OSIA.   A total of 443 intermediate-range cruise missiles deployed inGreat Britain and Europe are scheduled for destruction, all withinthe first three years of the treaty.   Signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev, the treaty also calls for elimination of 169shorter-range Pershing I-A and 234 Pershing II intermediate-rangemissiles that the Army has deployed in West Germany.   The treaty requires elimination of all land-based nuclearmissiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles. The cruise missileshave a range of about 1,500 miles.   The warheads are not included in the destruction process, whichAir Force Lt. Col. Donald Black said specifies lengthwise cutsthrough the missiles and cutting the launchers in half.   ``The treaty does not eliminate the warheads,'' Pease said. ``Iteliminates the ability to deliver the warheads.''   He said implementation of the treaty is ``a confidence builderon both sides, and an important first step.''   Col. Robert Stone said destruction of the equipment should becompleted within about 72 hours.   The inspectors were to wear protective eye gear and ear plugsand would remain within the 600-by-300-foot fenced compound at theAerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center. The compound housesmissiles, canisters and launchers stockpiled for destruction.   ``When you have four rescue saws going, it's worse than going tothe dentist,'' Stone said.   Black said 58 Pershing missile stages were eliminated betweenSept. 8 and Friday at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant atKarnack, Texas. The Army is destroying at least some of thePershings by burning their engines.   The Pershings each have two stages, and their launchers will beeliminated beginning this week in Germany, said Susan Franklin, aspokeswoman for the On-Site Inspection Agency in Washington.   As of Friday, the Soviet Union had eliminated 277 missiles underthe treaty, which specifies destruction of 1,846 missiles ofseveral types: SS-20, SS-23, SS-12, SSC-X-4, SS-4 and SS-5.   The INF treaty is the first to allow on-site inspection and isviewed as a trial for the proposed Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty.That pact would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclearweapons by 30 percent to 50 percent and call for more intricateverification procedures.</TEXT></DOC>
