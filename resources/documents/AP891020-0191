(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patrolman Gary Fappiana's job these daysis tracking down reports of people missing and feared dead in therubble of the collapsed Cypress overpass on Interstate 880.   In the first 2{ hours after the quake hit Tuesday at 5:04 p.m.,he learned first-hand what it's like to fear that a loved-one mayhave been killed in an earthquake.   ``My wife does travel on that section of the freeway, and shegets off at 5,'' Fappiana said Friday. ``She was two blocks awaywhen it came down. I was watching a station that didn't have verbalcommunication with the helicopter showing the pictures, but I knewthat was the Cyrpess structure that had come down.   ``I waited 2{ hours in front of the TV 'til she came home.''   Ten police officers make telephone calls every four hours aroundthe clock to those who have made missing persons reports to findout if people have turned up.   By Friday afternoon, a total of 242 people had been reportedmissing in Oakland at some point in connection with the earthquake,said Sgt. Greg Hughes, who heads the missing persons office. Ofthose, 145 were later located, including seven dead whose next ofkin have been notified.   He said that left 97 missing, all of whom had a chance ofdriving on Interstate 880 when a mile-long section of thedouble-decker freeway collapsed, trapping cars in the rubble. Otherpolice reports have put the number missing as high as 167.   Hughes said about 80 of those were reported from the beginningand 15 or 20 represent more recent reports.   One of the missing is Melissa Maxwell, a deputy districtattorney for Alameda County.   She left her office, located next to the freeway, on Tuesdayafternoon for the San Francisco airport to pick up some relatives,and hasn't been heard from since, said Senior Deputy DistrictAttorney John Adams.   ``They found some cars and one of them looked like hers,'' Adamssaid. ``We're hoping for the best, but who knows?''   Marc Zambetti, 27, a sales manager for Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co.in San Leandro, is also missing.   ``He left work at 12 minutes to five on the earthquake dayheading for the city,'' plant manager Dominic Clarco told theTribune. ``Two hours later, I started hearing about the Cypressoverpass collapsing.   ``Right now, I am on pins and needles waiting to hear,'' hesaid. ``We've just hired somebody who is going to sit in hisapartment for the next 24 or 48 hours in case someone calls, incase he calls.''   Fappiana said that as many as a dozen wrecked cars towed awayfrom the freeway had no bodies in them.   ``It's totally amazing,'' said Hughes. ``I can't understand it,unless some people had some pre-warning and were able to abandontheir cars.   ``We have not had anybody calling us back to say, `I made it outof my car,'' Hughes said.   He added that the count has been complicated by the fact thatsome of the dead who have been identified were never reportedmissing.   That's why police are regularly calling everyone who has made areport.   ``It's not like an air crash, where people are international,''said Hughes. ``You have people, working stiffs, living in the EastBay or the ity (San Francisco).   ``There's a lot of people close to home,'' he said.   Danna Fabella, division director of children's placementservices for Alameda County, has been running a volunteer hotlinefor people asking about loved ones.   She was so busy after the earthquake, she never called herhusband, who was on a business trip in Puerto Rico, to let him knowshe was safe.   ``He called me at 3 in the morning and absolutely cried,'' shesaid. ``I said I was sorry, but I knew I was OK. I just didn'tthink he would be worried.''</TEXT></DOC>
