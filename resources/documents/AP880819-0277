The sales agent boasts that the house, owned by Prince AbdulFaisal of Saudi Arabia, may be ``the world's most expensive listedresidence.''   Faisal had the home built only four years ago in the fashionableRiver Oaks neighborhood.   ``I think the reason he's selling it is because he doesn't everuse it,'' said Realtor Marilyn Hoffman of Dallas.   She said that, although the asking price is steep, ``the houseis worth it. It's just a palace.''   Tax records show the house has 22,400 square feet of spacedivided into 20 rooms, 10 of them bedrooms. There are 10 baths,five half-baths, three recreation rooms and three wood-burningfireplaces.   One of the recreation rooms is a gymnasium, Ms. Hoffman said.   She said the exterior is covered in imported white Frenchlimestone. Amenities include gold-plated bathroom fixtures, carvedmarble switchplates and a computerized air-conditioning system.   Ms. Hoffman said the brass and beveled glass front doors alonecost more than $100,000.   The house sits on a three-acre site. Its grounds feature a 60-by22-foot swimming pool with a bathhouse, tax records show.   The Harris County Appraisal District lists the house's value atonly $7.7 million. The 1987 tax bill on the house totaled $132,000.   Faisal's Alfanco Inc. was a minority partner in Heritage Plaza,a 53-story downtown office building completed in 1986 but still 90percent vacant. Faisal since has sold his interest in the building.   Just this week, MCO Plaza, a 22-story building Alfanco builtnear the Galleria in west Houston, was posted for foreclosure.   Some experts are skeptical about the asking price of Faisal'shome. One residence in River Oaks sold for $5.5 million five yearsago, and ``nothing has sold for more than that,'' said RobinElverson, a veteran Realtor.   The previous high list price was $16 million in 1982, and thathouse now lists for $9.5 million, according to Dick Lewis of GeorgeMurray andamp; Co.   Still, Martha Turner of Martha Turner Properites Inc. saidvalue, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.   ``Is the house worth $35 million to you?'' she said. ``I hopethey get $35 million.''   To sell the property, Ms. Hoffman is counting on a buyer fromoverseas. ``We have a Japanese man coming to look at it,'' Ms.Hoffman said.</TEXT></DOC>
