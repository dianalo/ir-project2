In another development, an official was quoted as saying Chinais considering measures to restrict political activity in Hong Kongafter the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.   China said the U.S. bill, drawn up to protest China's bloodyquelling of the pro-democracy movement last spring, ``maliciouslyvilifies and attacks the Chinese government.''   The bill has been sent to President Bush, who could veto it. Itcalls for two years of trade sanctions including a freeze onexports of satellites, helicopters and certain nuclear material,and a halt to risk insurance for American firms in China.   The latest attack came from the National People's Congress,China's largely ceremonial legislature.   ``We hereby express our strong condemnation and lodge a strongprotest against this hegemonic behavior of the U.S. Congress whichgrossly interferes in China's internal affairs, willfully tramplingon the basic norms governing international relations,'' thestatement said.   ``Such a disgusting performance of power politics only serves toreveal its own arrogance and prejudice, and help people see clearlythe stubborn position of hostility to China and its people on thepart of certain forces in the U.S. Congress,'' said the statement,read on state-run television and carried by the official XinhuaNews Agency.   The call for sanctions comes in the wake of the Chinese army'sbloody crackdown in early June against unarmed protesters seekingdemocratic reforms.   The bill says the ``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminateassault'' left 700 dead. China has said some 300 people died, butwestern intelligence estimates put the number as high as 3,000.   The Chinese government maintains the demonstrations were aimedat overthrowing the Communist leadership.   In Hong Kong, Li Hou, a top Chinese official in Hong Kongaffairs, was quoted as saying China is considering prohibitingcontacts with overseas political groups and limiting or banningforeign nationals from the territory's legislature.   Li, speaking to reporters in the Chinese city of Canton, saidthe measures were being considered as part of Hong Kong'spost-colonial constitution to prevent attempts to``internationalize'' the territory.   China is ``worried that Hong Kong will become a base forsubversive activities against the Chinese central government andthe socialist systems on the mainland,'' Li was quoted as saying bythe English-language South China Morning Post.</TEXT></DOC>
