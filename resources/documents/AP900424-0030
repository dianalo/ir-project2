Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Sunday as the pope wound upa trip to Czechoslovakia that the Polish-born pontiff would visitCuba in December before Christmas, though not date has been set.   But the official Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, on Mondayquoted the Foreign Ministry as saying there is no such plan for apapal visit. The dispatch was monitored in Mexico City.   The Vatican last year accepted an invitation to visit from Cubanleader Fidel Castro. In March, while on a visit to Brazil, Castrosaid a visit by the pope was ``practically agreed upon.''   However, he also criticized the Catholic Church in Cuba at thattime, saying it should dedicate itself to the people instead of``assuming an anti-revolutionary position.''   The pope encouraged the toppling of unpopular Communist regimesin Eastern Europe and is now warning that region's newly freedpeoples to be wary of what he calls the spiritually impoverishedmaterialism of the capitalist West.   Castro has staunchly defended his brand of Communism and theimproved living standards it has meant for Cubans, refusing toembrace free market reforms encouraged by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. </TEXT></DOC>
