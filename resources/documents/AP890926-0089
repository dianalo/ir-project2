(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jurors at Jim Bakker's fraud trialwatched videotapes of Bakker's TV show today, including one inwhich ``Love Boat'' captain Gavin MacLeod said God had saved hismarriage.   The jurors saw a 1985 show on which MacLeod and his wife, Patty,discussed how their Christian faith allowed them to remarry threeyears after they divorced. Bakker and his wife, Tammy, alsodiscussed their marital problems.   MacLeod began crying when he was introduced by Bakker, saying,``I don't think I've stopped crying since I came to the Lord.''   Bakker talked about how many Hollywood stars have appeared onPTL shows.   ``What is God doing?'' he asked. ``He won't leave you alone. Godwants to take Hollywood.''   Bakker said he and Tammy had experienced their own maritalproblems. ``Tammy said `Jim, I don't love you anymore.' And I said,`I don't love you anymore, either,''' he said, adding that theywere able to save their marriage because of their strong faith.   ``What these people are saying is real,'' Bakker said. ``Ourmarriage died and their marriage died. Sure, we still haveproblems. But to get to heaven, you have to have had problems.''   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by using more than$3.7 million in ministry money to live in style. He faces up to 120years in prison and more than $5 million in fines if convicted onall 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   On Monday, a former builder for Bakker testified that the Rev.Jerry Falwell, who took over PTL after Bakker resigned in a sex andmoney scandal, offered Bakker a $300,000 annual salary for life andother perks to keep quiet.   Defense attorney George T. Davis never asked Messner what Bakkerwas supposed to keep quiet about. It was not clear whether Bakkerturned down the alleged offer. Roe Messner, tstifying for thedefense, was not questioned further about the matter.   But a Falwell spokesman said Bakker had asked for the money andperks.   Messner also said a PTL official claimed Bakker knew nothingabout $265,000 in hush money paid to Jessica Hahn, the churchsecretary with whom Bakker had a sexual encounter in 1980.   Messner testified that Falwell sent him to Palm Springs, Calif.,in May 1987 to offer Bakker a deal: the $300,000 salary, a maid, asecurity guard, health insurance and telephone expenses ``if hekept his mouth shut.''   Bakker's wife, Tammy, jotted down the offer on a piece of herpink stationery, and Bakker wrote at the bottom: ```I'm not makingany demands on PTL. I'm not asking for anything,''' according toMessner.   Falwell, founder of the now-defunct Moral Majority, deniedMessner's account.   The offer actually was a demand from Bakker, said Falwell'sspokesman, Mark DeMoss, in a telephone interview.   DeMoss said Falwell did dispatch Messner to Palm Springs to talkto Bakker, but he carried no offer. DeMoss said Messner returnedwith a handwritten list of demands on the Mrs. Bakker's stationery.   DeMoss said Bakker's demands included hospital insurance, a$300,000 annual salary for life, a $100,000 annual salary for lifefor his wife, royalties on inspirational books and recordings madeby the Bakkers, secretary and maid service for a year, use of aSouth Carolina lakefront house and furniture and attorneys' fees.   Messner, who testified that he handled the $265,000 payment toMs. Hahn, also said that at a Feb. 21, 1985, lunch, PTL ExecutiveVice President Richard Dortch told him: ```I'm going to ask you todo a big favor. I'm asking you because I know you'll keep itconfidential.'''   Dortch told Messner that if he didn't pay a woman from New York$265,000, then she would go to The Charlotte Observer withallegations that Bakker raped her. Five days later, Messner said,he wired the $265,000 to an account number in California that wasgiven to him by Dortch.   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment,and Dortch replied: ```No, I'm acting on my own.'''   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because theAssemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuitthreatened by Ms. Hahn.   ``I didn't think the church ought to be dragged into thisincident,'' Messner said.</TEXT></DOC>
