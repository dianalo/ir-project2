MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some of the National Rifle Association's bestfriends are worried that the gun lobby may be shooting itself in thefoot.   A conservative editor and activist says NRA absolutism has keptit from cooperating with some of its natural allies, among themconservative groups, police organizations and, in some cases,Republicans.   Patrick B. McGuigan, writing in Policy Review, a journalpublished by the conservative Heritage Foundation, says that has cutinto NRA political clout and put the organization on the defensive.   ``Many of the NRA's current difficulties are the result ofself-inflicted wounds,'' he writes. ``During the past few years, theorganization has refused to play coalition politics with its naturalallies in the conservative movement including, most especially,elements of organized law enforcement.   ``A go-it-alone approach and a refusal to compromise on less thancritical issues is jeopardizing the NRA's effectiveness in winningpolitical support on those issues that it considers most important.''   The NRA has been skirmishing with the Republican administrationin recent months over the government's decision to ban the importingof 43 types of semiautomatic assault weapons. President Bush signedthat order July 7. Congress is considering legislation that wouldimpose new restrictions on U.S.-made assault weapons.   After Bush signed the permanent ban on imports, the NRA said someof its members wanted to kick him out of the organization. Bush, whosaid during the 1988 campaign that he opposed federal gun control,is a lifetime member of the NRA. A spokesman said he intended toremain one.   When the question of city or state gun controls came up Wednesdayat an informal news conference in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush saidthe people of Portland and of Maine should decide for themselves.   ``The Constitution gives you certain rights in that regard,'' headded. ``What I want to get is strong support for our anti-crimepackage, stronger predictable sentencing, tougher terms, morejudges, more people to make those pay who are breaking the law.''   The NRA also took on William J. Bennett, director of the Officeof National Drug Control Policy, who had recommended the ban. JamesA. Warner, an NRA lawyer, wrote that U.S. servicemen would bedeprived of their right to bring home assault weapons, and suggestedBennett might not understand because he was in graduate schoolduring the height of the Vietnam war.   ``While you may not be familiar with the life of a serviceman,for many of these men the chance to bring home firearms while postedoverseas is small recompense for the isolation, the boredom and therisk of overseas duty,'' Warner wrote.   There have been more concrete NRA rebukes to the Republicans andthe administration. McGuigan says the NRA and other gun-owners'groups contributed to the GOP loss of the Indiana House seat onceheld by Vice President Dan Quayle, and sat out a Wyoming specialelection narrowly won by the Republicans.   ``This double punishment of the GOP probably served a usefulpurpose _ encouraging the Bush administration to refocus its drugstrategies more on crime control than on gun control,'' McGuiganwrites. ``But it also weakened the party that has been mostsympathetic to the NRA overall, and showed a spitefulness toward theBush administration, with which it probably should be cooperating,not fighting.''   McGuigan also complains that the NRA refused to join forces withconservatives working for Senate confirmation of Robert H. Bork'snomination to the Supreme Court in 1987. ``As one of the strategistswho sought to secure Bork's confirmation, I know we badly needed theNRA's help and didn't get it.''   McGuigan says the NRA apparently was unwilling to help Bork forfear that he would oppose the suppression of evidence obtainedduring investigations and searches that might involve firearmsdealers. He also quotes an NRA official as saying the White Housedidn't want an early endorsement of Bork from the controversial gungroup.   But by his account, other single-interest conservative groupstook up the Bork campaign even though their positions and his werenot in total accord.   ``By failing to admit the possibility of regulations that do notlimit the basic right to bear arms, the NRA is cutting itself offfrom a broader movement of judicial reform,'' McGuigan says.   He says the organization may be moving in that direction now. HisHeritage Foundation piece reads like an effort to encourage justthat.   ``America's voters will give strong support to a politicalcoalition that can push through reform measures to keep dangerousoffenders off the streets,'' McGuigan concludes. ``The NRA can playa very important role in this coalition, and in so doing channel guncontrol into its proper direction.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
