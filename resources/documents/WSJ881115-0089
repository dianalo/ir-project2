(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The largest home and car insurer in California, State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co., said it has stopped writing new auto policies in the state because of chaos surrounding rate-slashing Proposition 103.    State Farm Mutual will continue to carry and renew policies for its more than three million auto-insurance customers, the company announced. But new applications will be referred to a subsidiary that has higher rates, thus shielding the company from some of the cuts that would be imposed by Proposition 103.    The unit, State Farm Fire andamp; Casualty Co., charges 20% to 60% more for car insurance than does State Farm Mutual because State Farm Fire insures higher-risk drivers rejected by its parent, a spokesman said from the companies' Bloomington, Ill., headquarters.    State Farm Fire has about 300,000 auto policies in California and also is the state's biggest homeowners-insurance carrier.    Implementation of Proposition 103, approved by voters last week, was blocked by the California Supreme Court. But uncertainty in the industry has already prompted a number of companies to either stop writing insurance or to consider a halt. Proposition 103 orders sweeping changes of the insurance industry, including a 20% rate cut below November 1987 rates for auto, home and commercial insurance.    Separately, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Hartford, Conn., said it isn't accepting new business in California. But, a spokesman said, the insurer will renew policies for its existing customers. The spokesman said Aetna will decide whether further action is necessary once the court challenges to Proposition 103 are resolved. </TEXT></DOC>
