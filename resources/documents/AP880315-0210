Sections of the capital were turned into battlegrounds ashundreds of civil servants took to the streets to demand theirpaychecks. Riot squads fired tear gas, water cannons and shotgunsloaded with birdshot. At least a dozen people were injured.   Americans became involved.   _Panama ordered Terence Kneebone, director of the U.S.Information Service here, to leave the country within 48 hours, aU.S. Embassy source said. The United States said it would ignorethe directive because it was delivered by a regime not recognizedby the United States as the legitimate authority.   _The U.S. Southern Command said Panamanian police detained threeAmerican soldiers in the port of Colon, at the Caribbean entranceof the Panama Canal, but released them several hours later. Thecommand also said it upgraded the alert status for its 10,000personnel and 20,000 dependents.   _A photographer for the Dallas Morning News, David Leeson, wasamong those hurt in the worst demonstration at the main SocialSecurity Institute hospital in northern Panama City. A shotgunpellet pierced his cheek and chipped a tooth.   Leeson was treated at the hospital's emergency room, along withat least seven othe people. Three were hit in the face by birdshotand two children were overcome by tear gas.   Other slightly wounded demonstrators spurned hospital care.   Medical workers hurled Molotov cocktails at police just outsidethe grounds of the sprawling facility and riot police respondedwith shotgun fire and tear gas grenades. Fumes penetrated theinterior of the 500-bed hospital.   ``Assassins,'' cried hospital employees. ``Noriega, tyrant, yourend is near!''   The complex includes the six-story hospital, a specializedclinic and administrative offices.   Several miles away, in the heart of the city, police sprayingdiluted tear gas from a water cannon broke up a demonstration byabout 300 teachers and employees of the Ministry of Education.   Disturbances flared Monday when thousands of public employeesfailed to receive semimonthly paychecks. Strikes begun by teachers,telephone workers and longshoremen were joined Tuesday by employeesof the Ministry of Treasury and Finance.   The government announced it would begin making at least partialsalary payments Tuesday to its employees. But workers at thehospital, the treasury and education departments said they had notheard of the plan.   It was not known late Tuesday how many workers actually gotpaid, either in full or partially.   ``We were protesting peacefully because we were supposed to getpaid yesterday (Monday) and we still do not know anything,'' said anurse, who refused to give her name. ``I had to borrow money frommy grandfather to come to work.''   In Washington, the Reagan administration has let it be known ithopes Panama's difficulties in meeting its payrolls will lead tostrongman Noriega's removal as head of the 15,000-member DefenseForces.   Two U.S. grand juries indicted Noriega last month on charges oftrafficking in drugs. Noriega denied the charges.   Riot police stepped in to quell the demonstration at the SocialSecurity hospital when workers built barricades of rubbish across afour-lane, divided highway, halting heavy morning rush-hour trafficin both directions.   Firing tear gas grenades, police moved the workers back behind aheavy wire fence surrounding the hospital. Some employees, wearingsurgical masks against the gas, used metal tabletops as shields tothrow rocks at the police.   Then some workers, mostly young men, made firebombs and hurledthem at police. They used surgical gauze for wicks after pouringgasoline into empty rum bottles.   Other employees were seen throwing furniture from upstairswindows of the six-story hospital. At least one policeman wasstruck on the head by a rock.   ``This is a hospital!,'' cried a nurse. ``How can they do this!We are under siege!''   Students threw rocks at police from a university building acrossthe highway.   Treasury Minister Hector Alexander said the government plannedto pay workers on a sliding scale. Employees making less than $200a month would get full wages. Those getting up to $999 would get$75. People making more than $1000 would get nothing.   More than 1,000 dockworkers remained on strike at Colon andPanama City, the entrances to the the 50-mile-long Panama Canalthat links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.   The Panama Canal Commission said Tuesday the walkout had notaffected transit through the waterway, which handles an average 30ships a day.   The Reagan administration hopes government inability to pay itsworkers will bring down Noriega, who engineered the ouster ofPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried tofire him.   The United States imposed new economic sanctions on Panama lastFriday, including withholding $6.5 million in canal fees due thisweek. It earlier cut off all economic and military aid to Panama.   Foreign and local banks have remained closed in Panama.   In Washington, the Panamanian Embassy said Delvalle instructedAmbassador Juan B. Sosa that once Noriega is gone, ``all funds thathave been frozen in escrow will be primarily used to pay the salaryof public workers, a duty that the illegimate government has beenunable to accomplish.''   Sosa refused to recognize the Feb. 26 change in government andcontinues to support Delvalle.   Asked Tuesday about the possibility of waiving extradition tospeed Noriega's departure from Panama, President Reagan said, ``Wedo want Noriega out of there and a return to a civilian democraticgovernment.''</TEXT></DOC>
