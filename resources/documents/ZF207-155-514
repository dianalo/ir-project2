Telecommunications isincreasingly important.andP;  For example, just-in-time inventorysystems depend on good telecommunications.andP;  As communicationscontinue to improve and as flexible-robot systems are more widelyaccepted, products will be made in smaller batches.andP;  Robots willnot cause mass unemployment: in fact, Japanese factories that areautomating are exactly the ones that provide the most employeesecurity.andP;  As companies become more efficient, they will getsmaller.andP;  Eventually, everyone can look forward to running theirown businesses.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TelecommunicationsCompetitionFlexible Manufacturing SystemsOutlookTrendsJust In Time Inventory SystemsIndustrial RobotsFactory ManagementTechnology-Induced UnemploymentSocial IssuesAutomation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FASTER AND SMALLERandM;Want your firm to succeed?andP;  Then think telecom in a major way.andP;  Here's proof,from Harry's favorite magazine, The Economist, December 24, 1988:andM;One firm of tomorrow which exists today is America's The Limited (a women'sclothing chain based in Columbus, OH).andP;  Each evening it collects data fromits Electric Points of Sale (EPOS) showing what number, size, color, fashionof clothes have been sold that day in its 3,200 stores across the UnitedStates.andM;This is at once telecommunicated to its workshops in Hongkong, Singapore, SriLanka -- and becomes their main cutting order for the next day.andP;  A few dayslater a Boeing 747 takes off from Hongkong for Ohio with these just-in-timeinventory replacements.andP;  It is easy to put computerized design changes forfashion experiments into such a system, and to see from the EPOS if, whereand to what income groups they sell well.andM;Eventually in such firms customers should be able to design their own clothesby playing with graphics on a computer, and inserting the requiredhieroglyphics into the cutting order.andM;Most other things will also be made in smaller and smaller batches, so thatwven cars can be almost custom-built.andP;  There are already several hundredoptional extras or modifications you can choose in models of Japanese carsmade in America.andM;The flexible-robot systems concerned can be ordered to make a statedmodification on item number 998 coming down the line.andP;  Similarly, Mr. Smith'sdaily newspaper will eventually not be the Daily Express but the Daily MrSmith.andM;He will be able to order the news service of the Daily Telegraph and AsahiShimbun, the opinion columns of the Wall Street Journal and Pravda, anythingwritten about the 2.30 at Sandown and leather miniskirts or whatever are hisparticular kinks, anything written on the future provided it is not by me.andM;The Daily Mr Smith will then come out of a fax machine at the back of histelevision set, accompanied by advertisements geared to his thus-revealedtastes (he will have to pay more to avoid being sent these).andM;Most metal-bashed goods will still be fashioned by professional designers,but they can go straight to prototype without the aid of a productionengineer.andM;A lot of factory workers may not even need to go to the factory.andP;  In onefactory of the future near Mount Fuji, robots make robots.andP;  By day 20 workerstend the factory.andP;  By night the automatic machinery pounds on under thesupervision of a single man at the control console.andP;  He could, if he wished,eventually operate that console from home, even if it were a home in adifferent continent.andM;People transporting the supplies and finished goods of the factory will haveto go it, but these distribution workers will also become brainworkers withcomputers at fingertip.andM;Their vans will be warehouses-on-wheels tied electronically into thejust-in-time inventory systems of the factories or distributors they aredelivering from or to.andP;  Already some trucking companies in America allowcustomers to play straight into their computers to find where a particularorder they have placed now is.andP;  Public post offices will go bust unless theyallow the same.andM;The usual spectre aroused by the story of the Mount Fujji factory is of massunemployment.andP;  That is the opposite of what is going to occur.andP;  The Japanesefactories that have automated most fiercely are precisely the ones that stilloffer their workers jobs for life.andM;Teams and networks will take over from hierarchies and bureaucracies.andP;  Teamswill often grow to be the equivalent of a small business within a largebusiness, although team members will sometimes telecommunicate from thousandsof miles apart.andM;When TV channels first developed the video-recorder as an expensiveinstrument for action replays, the half-dozen big Japanese electroniccompanies saw a business opportunity.andP;  They said to competing teams ofresearchers: if you can get the retail price of these things below $1,000they will be a consumer good fof tens of millions of homes; try to get aworking model before one year.andM;In future that sort of definition of a target product will often be put tocompeting teams of telecommuting researchers, playing into the databases fromafar.andP;  This will be more efficent than relying on the 30 or so people youhappen to have in your R andamp; D department.andM;These systems of subcontracting, and the race to replace everything the EPOSshows to be fading, will change the whole idea of career structures.andP;  Noyoungster entering a big corporation today should dream of beingvice-president by age 50.andP;  When he is 50, corporate bureaucracies shouldhardly exist.andP;  Everybody in the company, down to the janitor, should beaiming to run his own small business.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
