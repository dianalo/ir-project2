LOUIS.'A TOWN WHERE ALL TROUBLES MEETISOLATED AND BROKE, EAST ST. LOUIS HAS RUNINTO A DEAD END  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;Take any urban ill in any city in this country and you will find all of itin East St. Louis, and you will find it compounded because it is concentratedand isolated,&quot; said Ronald Bean, executive director of the IllinoisDevelopment Finance Authority and a member of a board appointed by the statelast fall to oversee the city's finances.;    &quot;There is a serious question asto whether you can turn a community like this around. It's a tragicsituation.&quot;;    The city chose a new mayor in an uncontested election Tuesday,but few expect him to reverse a decline that has reached crisis proportions inthe last two years.;    The city's slide into a kind of economic quicksand hasconfounded state officials, who in the last few months have been assigned tosave it and who are only now beginning to measure its desperation.;    Theyare working without a road map or much precedent. While there has been nocomparative research on East St. Louis and cities like it, economists canthink of few if any places -- outside, perhaps, rural Appalachia or the DeepSouth -- where the problems are so pervasive and extreme.;    The decline ofEast St. Louis has been so rapid that virtually anyone who could afford toleave has moved away. The city has gone from a peak of about 82,000predominantly white residents in 1960 to about 41,000 residents in 1990,nearly all of them black and poor.;    Fully half the city's residents areunemployed and 75 percent of them receive some form of public assistance.;   Around the country there are several small, predominantly black towns thatstand in the shadow of major cities -- Camden, N.J., and Gary, Ind., forinstance -- all struggling with high unemployment and a host of urban ills.But most are much larger towns with a more diversified tax base and havemanaged to keep some of the industry that once made them great cities.;    ButEast St. Louis is a city at rock bottom, a partly inhabited ghost town whosefactories, theaters, hotels, auto dealerships, gas stations and half itsschools are mostly burned-out shells.;    The city was once a prosperous andbrawling blue-collar town of stockyards and meat-packing plants, railroads andspeakeasies and neat frame houses along the Mississippi River.;    Residentsfondly remember when there were flowers in Jones Park, and when, as AlderwomanWillie Reese said, &quot;you didn't mind for your relatives to come and visityou.&quot;;    But advances in technology made the old meat-packing plantsoutdated; most of them closed by the 1970s, taking with them other industriesand the city's tax base.;    &quot;I can't think of any city of its size that hasas little to work with,&quot; said Charles L. Leven, a professor of urban economicsat Washington University in St. Louis.;    &quot;It's a ghetto neighborhood that byhistorical accident is a town unto itself,&quot; he said. &quot;That very separatenessmeans that nothing good can spill over the boundary from St. Louis.&quot;;    Theresult has been fiscal chaos of such proportions that the city cannot providethe most basic of services.;    The city has not collected trash for fouryears, forcing people to pay for private collection services, burn garbage intheir back yards or dump it wherever they can.;    The city's decaying sewersystem has spewed raw sewage into homes and schools. City police officers mustsometimes patrol the city in their own cars because the city's police carshave broken down.;     Last year, unable to satisfy a court judgment againstit, the city had to give away City Hall as part of a settlement that made EastSt. Louis a national symbol of municipal hard luck.;    &quot;You don't seeanything like that in America in 1991,&quot; Ronald Bean said. &quot;You could takepictures of Kuwait or Beirut or Baghdad and hold them up to a picture of EastSt. Louis and you could not tell the difference.&quot;;    For 12 years, East St.Louis was run by Mayor Carl E. Officer, a brusque and flamboyantthird-generation funeral director who inherited a city weakened by corruptadministrations, most of them influenced by organized crime.;    Butconditions only worsened during his administration as the city sufferedembarrassment after embarrassment and the mayor attributed the problems towhite state and county officials who he said had abandoned the city.;    Itwas under Officer's watch that the city had to give away City Hall, one of thefew buildings not a shambles, to a prisoner who was beaten by another inmatein the city jail.;    In the last year or two, the city has had many of itsbasic powers -- like running the local housing authority or putting together acity budget -- taken over by the state or federal government.;     In perhapsthe biggest debacle of the Officer administration, a grand scheme to turn theflood plains on the East St. Louis side of the Mississippi into luxurycondominiums ended in court rather than in the riverfront revival Officer hadpromised. The city was awarded $7 million, to be paid by the Wall Streetinvestment firm of Matthews andamp; Wright for defrauding the city out of millionsof dollars.;    But the federal judge who made the ruling did not trust thecity with the money and set up a foundation to control it. Meanwhile, theriverfront remains a weed-filled wasteland, and Officer is under investigationfor his role. Officer declined to comment on the case or the city.;    InFebruary, residents voted Officer out of the City Hall he gave away and choseGordon Bush, a former city treasurer who has a master's degree in urbanplanning, as their nominee in the Democratic primary. The 48-year-oldmayor-elect, who will take office May 1, had no opponents in the April 2general election.;    His election is being seen as a turning point for a cityon the brink. In the campaign, voters walked up to Bush with desperation intheir eyes. One told him, &quot;If you don't pull it off this time, I'm selling myhouse and leaving.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ISABEL WILKERSON, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  East St. Louis, Ill.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,160  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101207,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
