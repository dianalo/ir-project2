The petitioner requested inaccordance with andSection; 353.53a(a) of the Commerce Regulations that weconduct an administrative review for the period March 1, 1986, throughFebruary 28, 1987. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumpingduty administrative review on April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13268). The Departmenthas now conducted that administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s). HTS items are providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.Imports covered by the review are shipments of certain valves and connections,of brass, suitable for use in interior fire protection systems from Italy.This merchandise consists of single and double clapper siamese fire departmentconnections and pressure restricting valves. During the review period,such merchandise was classifiable under items 680.1420 and 680.1440 ofthe Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. The merchandise iscurrently classifiable under HTS item numbers 8481.80.1050 and 8481.80.1070.The review covers one manufacturer/exporter and one third-country resellerof this merchandise to the United States and the period March 1, 1986,through February 28, 1987.The manufacturer, Rubinetterie A. Giacomini (``Giacomini''), provided aninadequate response to our request for information. Specifically, Giacominifailed to provide a narrative on certain variables listed in its submissionrelative to the Canadian and United States prices; failed to provide modelmatch information for each model sold to the United States; failed to providecost differences (material, direct labor and factory overhead) betweenmodels sold to the United States and the Canadian models; provided incompleteand inadequate constructed value information which did not include a descriptionof its accounting system, direct labor, factory overhead, selling, generaland administrative (SGandamp;A) expenses, profit, export packing, a listingof all materials and the amounts of each, and the purchase price and quantityof each material used in the production of the merchandise; and providedno explanation as to why some shipment dates preceded sale dates in itssales data submission. Therefore, we used the best information otherwiseavailable.During the previous administrative review, the Department found no marginsfor Giacomini and an 85.54 percent margin for Giacomini's sales to theUnited States through Ganbrook Limited (``Ganbrook''). Since informationon the record for this review indicates that Ganbrook acted as an agentof Giacomini, the best information available for these firms is 85.54 percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the followingmargins exist:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,14,8</C> <H1>Manufacturer/Exporter/Third-Country Reseller (Country)</H1><H1>Time period</H1><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="2">Rubinetterie A.
