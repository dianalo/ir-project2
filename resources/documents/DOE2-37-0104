The first part, 'Knowledge-Based Pictorial Information Systems,'describes a prototype system that enables users to manage all types ofinformation, especially pictorial information. The Image Database ManagementSystem (IDBM) provides an integrated standard that can be used to specifythe information to be retrieved, in a format acceptable to all participatingcomputers. The second part, 'Storage and Retrieval of Pictorial Informationin Heterogeneous Computing Systems,' studies existing techniques forstoring pictorial images, such as bit-mapped mechanisms, vector-basedtechniques, and quadtree and pyramid-oriented approaches. Recent advancesin compression techniques are also discussed. The third part, 'An ExpertSystem for Accessing and Integrating Design Analysis Knowledge,' presentsan approach for integrating information from multiple design environments.Mechanical design packages such as CADAM and CATIA, thermal design packagessuch as ITAM and PHOENIS, and other specialized packages can be linkedtogether through a common expert system. The fourth part highlights anumber of critical connectivity issues in the context of data communicationnetworks maintained by two large organizations. (RH)</TEXT></DOC>
