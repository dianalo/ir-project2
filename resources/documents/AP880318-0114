The U.S.-backed government promised to ensure safe transport inthe face of threats by the leftist insurgents trying to disruptSunday's legislative and municipal voting.   But none of the privately owned buses _ and few cars _ bravedthe streets of San Salvador for what would normally be the morningrush hour.   A few pickup and van owners, however, offered rides for up tosix times the normal bus fare of about 10 cents.   Army trucks loaded with soldiers rumbled through town, andtroops with assault rifles guarded gas stations. The guerrillassaid gas stations selling fuel during the strike would beconsidered ``military objectives.''   The guerrillas have also declared polling places ``militaryobjectives'' and warned people to stay away.   The indefinite nationwide strike began at midnight. Police saidtwo buses headed for the eastern city of Usulutan were stopped byguerrillas before dawn, emptied and burned.   The transport ban is the latest chapter in a violent guerrillacampaign against the elections.   The rebels say peace should come before elections. They demand ashare of power in exchange for laying down their arms, but thegovernment of President Jose Napoleon Duarte rejects this.   The Defense Ministry has said it will deploy 53,000 of its56,000 troops to safeguard the voting. Defense Minister Gen.Eugenio Vides Casanova said his men could guarantee voter securityat 244 of the nation's 262 polling places.   The threat against polling places and service stations came in astatement from one of the leader of one of guerrilla's new urbanunits, the Pedro Castillo Urban Command.   The command is a unit of the People's Revolutionary Army, one offive guerrilla groups united in the Faribundo Marti NationalLiberation Front. It was not clear if the rebel leader spoke forthe entire front or just his unit.   It warned people ``to avoid gathering at polling places because,due to the presence of troops, they ... will be considered militarytargets.''   Channel 6 television broadcast the statement Wednesday and laterprovided a transcript to the Associated Press.   ``The urban commando cells are going to take a series of actionsto repudiate the elections and to repudiate U.S. intervention inour country,'' the guerrilla leader known as Commander Ester said.   The United States gave El Salvador almost $600 million in aidlast year, more than it gave any other country in the WesternHemisphere.   El Salvador's civil was has claiemd 65,000 lives since it beganin 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
