(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Microrim Inc.andM;R:BASE 3.1andM;R:base has easily the best implementation of database architecture and dataintegrity of the three reviewed products.andP;  However, the current version isplagued by some reliability problems that hinder its use on LAN Managernetworks.andM;Among the three reviewed products, only R:base creates a database as atightly integrated entity made up of data tables, indexes, relations anddata-integrity rules.andP;  The definitions of these database objects are recordedwithin the database itself, and not in the application code that processesthe database.andP;  This allows R:base to enforce a higher degree of dataintegrity than the other two database systems.andM;Specifically, this means that the developer has to specify the rules forlimits of data values and for relational constraints only once when definingthe database, not in each program.andP;  Furthermore, the same rules areautomatically applied to all operations, whether performed by a program orinteractively by the user from the command line or from the menu interface.andM;Each database has its own data dictionary that enforces identical definitionsof identically named fields in all tables.andP;  For example, if the first tablecreated in a database defines the word &quot;state&quot; as a two-character text field,the same field name defined in another table will automatically get the sameattributes.andP;  However, each field in each table can have its owndata-integrity rules.andM;Tables can be indexed on single fields only, but the effect of compoundindexes can be obtained by indexing on calculated fields that contain theconcatenation of two or more other fields.andP;  Calculated fields are maintainedautomatically and do not take up physical space in the database.andM;The capabilities of interactive and programmed modes of operation are fairlyevenly matched.andP;  Outside of preprogrammed applications, the end user canoperate either from the command line or from a menu interface.andP;  In thecommand-line mode, R:base resembles DOS and supports many of the samecommands, such as DIR and CLS.andP;  Database queries are performed by a dialectof Structured Query Language (SQL).andM;The menus present a Systems Application Architecture (SAA)-compliant,character-based point-and-shoot interface that is easy for new users yetreasonably efficient for more experienced users.andP;  Integration betweencommand-line and menu modes is very good.andP;  For example, a multitable querycan be created from the command line with a SQL statement, then displayed andmodified in the QBE screen.andM;The only drawback of the user interface is that it provides no default formfor viewing one record at a time.andP;  It is easy enough to create one, but sucha form must be created for each table.andP;  Paradox and dBASE automaticallyprovide a form for each table with no effort on the part of the user.andM;In multiuser operssations, R:base is again unique in that it appliescolumn-level locking during concurrent updates.andP;  Two or more users on anetwork can be simultaneously updating different fields of the same record;each station will update only the fields changed by that user.andP;  In the caseof multiple edits on the same field, all affected users are notified of thefield's new contents as soon as one user commits the change.andM;Network installation and configuration are fairly straightforward.andP;  Oneunnecessary complication is the need to enter the workstation name into anR:base configuration file on each workstation; unlike the other two products,R:base does not obtain this information from the network operating system.andO;There is therefore the possibility that a workstation will be identified by adifferent name within R:base than it is in other contexts.andM;Although R:base runs within 640K bytes, it performs better with access to 2Mbytes of additional memory, especially in its response times.andP;  R:base canmake use of either expanded memory (EMS version 3.2 or higher) or extendedmemory; to provide access to the latter, a copy of Microsoft Corp.'sHIMEM.SYS driver is included in the package.andP;  Microrim also encourages theuse of high-DOS memory for loading device drivers out of the lower 640Kbytes; a coupon for Qualitas Inc.'s 386Max memory manager is included withR:base 3.1.andM;However, R:base would not run on a LAN Manager workstation with a 386 controlprogram installed.andP;  Besides 386Max, PC Week Labs tried running it underQuarterdeck Office Systems' QEMM memory manager and the 386 Enhanced mode ofMicrosoft Windows, all with the same effect: The workstation crashed beforeR:base could bring up its logo screen.andM;On a stand-alone system, R:base ran fine with all three control programs.andO;Microrim officials said they are aware of the problem and are working on asolution.andM;As a result, the workstation configuration for R:base was different than forthe other two products (see Lab Notes, Page 93).andP;  Once these problems aresolved, R:base could be a formidable contender in the database sweepstakes.andM;----------Microrim Inc.andM;Bellevue, Wash.andP;  (206) 649-9500andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1981andM;Number of employees: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;Source: Information supplied by company.andM;The test environment for dBASE IV, Paradox and R:base comprised a networkrunning Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.0.andP;  The database managers and alldata were installed on the file server, a Compaq Deskpro 386/25.andP;  Networkedworkstations were a variety of IBM AT and PS/2 systems running IBM DOS 4.01.andM;The first test involved installation and configuration of each databasesystem on the Microsoft LAN Manager network server.andP;  Here, Paradox was thehands-down winner.andP;  Its documentation is the clearest, and the placement ofprogram and control files the most logical.andP;  All program files reside in ashared, read-only directory, with write permission necessary only to a smallnetwork-control file whose location is chosen by the network administrator.andM;dBASE IV does not provide specific instructions for any LANManager-compatible network; IBM's PC LAN program is the closest equivalentfor which instructions are given.andP;  The documentation's description of theprocedure is incomplete and unclear.andP;  Once installed, dBASE failed to startunless its network-control file was on the current drive.andP;  After many callsto Ashton-Tate's technical support, the solution turned out to be anundocumented command-line switch that specifies the location of the controlfile.andM;Although the manual recommends permitting read/write access to the directorycontaining the dBASE IV program, PC Week Labs encountered no problems withread-only access.andP;  The control file must be in a fixed directory one levelbelow the logical root of its drive; it must be shared with write permissionsgranted.andM;The installation of R:base was fairly straightforward.andP;  Specific examples inthe documentation mention only Novell NetWare and 3Com 3+Share systems, butthe generic instructions are clear enough.andP;  The only criticism is that thedocumentation does not explain clearly enough the need for and the procedureof recording workstation IDs within R:base configuration files on eachworkstation.andP;  Failure to do so allows only one user at a time to startR:base.andM;The network-control file must reside in the same directory as the R:baseprogram.andP;  The installation instructions recommend granting all users read,write and create rights to this directory, but PC Week Labs found thatread/write permission for the control file and read-only permission for therest of the directory worked fine.andM;However, R:base would not run on a workstation with a 386 virtual-controlprogram like Quarterdeck Office Systems' QEMM, Qualitas Inc.'s 386Max or theEnhanced mode of Microsoft Windows 3.0.andP;  It ran fine under these controlprograms on stand-alone systems, and on the network without the controlprograms.andM;Therefore, R:base was tested on a different workstation configuration thanthe other two databases.andP;  Without a memory manager, there was no expandedmemory, but Microsoft's HIMEM.SYS driver was used to provide extended memory.andM;As the results show, R:base did quite well in most database operations.andO;However, it was very slow in switching between the various parts of its menusystem; the lack of expanded memory caused a lot of disk activity for loadingoverlays.andM;Once installed, all three programs were timed in a series of databaseoperations.andP;  The primary test-data consisted of a mailing list of 8,900records.andM;The first test was importing data from an ASCII text file.andP;  The target tablewas defined with one compound index on two columns.andP;  For R:base, the indexwas created on a calculated column that was defined as the concatenation ofthe two desired columns.andM;The second test was a restructuring of the 8,900-row table by reordering twoof the columns.andM;Test three involved the creation of two additional indexes, a simple index ona single column and a compound one on three columns.andP;  Paradox does notsupport compound indexes, so could not be used to perform this test.andP;  ForR:base, a calculated column containing the desired concatenation first had tobe added to the data table.andM;The fourth test was a sort on three fields; the fifth test was asearch-and-replace operation using an unindexed field; and the sixth testinvolved exporting the data, using one of the indexes, to an ASCII text file.andM;The final series of tests timed a query involving a join of the mailing-listname table with a 61-row table of state and province names.andP;  The smallertable was indexed on the linking field.andM;The query was repeated with the large table both indexed and unindexed on thelinking field, and with one file first, then the other mentioned first in thequery.andM;Paradox writes the results of queries to an answer table on disk, while dBASEIV and R:base write only to the screen unless specifically instructedotherwise.andP;  To provide a fair comparison, the R:base query was timed withoutput to a disk file.andP;  There wasn't much point in directing dBASE queryoutput to a file, because even with output to the screen, it was one or twoorders of magnitude slower than the other two.andM;The main reason for the bad performance of dBASE is the poor quality of thecode generated by the query-by-example process.andP;  With an optimally hand-codedquery, the time for dBASE was cut down from 151 seconds to 40 seconds.andP;  That,however, is still slow: Under the same conditions, Paradox and R:base took 3and 4 seconds, respectively.andP;
