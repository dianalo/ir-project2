Tannenbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ELE RET </IN><TEXT>   By thinking small, Harvey Industries Inc. aims to hold a profitable, largely high-end niche in the cut-throat consumer-electronics industry.    &quot;You can live very well on 1% to 2% of the market,&quot; says James Conley, president and chief executive officer. &quot;We will take small contracts that nobody else will take. There's no one else in the industry thinking on the scale we do.&quot;    Also distinctive is Harvey's American ownership. Amid brutal competition, General Electric Co. sold its consumer electronics business to Paris-based Thomson S.A. last year. Now Zenith Electronics Corp., the biggest remaining U.S. producer of TV sets, is deeply troubled and under investor pressure to quit the field.    Except for Zenith and Harvey, there are no U.S.-owned TV-set producers of consequence in the market. Wells-Gardner Corp., Chicago, stopped assembling sets for a Japanese customer last May.    Six-year-old Harvey, with 900 workers and annual sales of $55 million to $60 million, makes sets for such robust companies as NEC Corp. of Japan and Colortyme Inc., a TV-rental chain based in Texas. It's also a major producer for Curtis Mathes Corp., a struggling electronics merchandiser owned by Ray Harvey, the 51-year-old Athens, Texas, entrepreneur who is Harvey's owner and chairman. Curtis Mathes had a loss of $18.1 million last year on sales of $225.9 million.    Harvey is separately run and profitable, Mr. Harvey says. Its 800,000-square-foot Athens plant was recently designated a foreign-trade zone, ending certain taxes and duties, and letting Harvey delay other duties on the imported parts on which it relies heavily. That helps Harvey's cash position and holds down costs. &quot;We're going to build a very high-quality product at a reasonable cost,&quot; Mr. Harvey says.    Cost control is crucial if Harvey is to help revive Curtis Mathes. Ray Harvey was a top Curtis Mathes sales executive in 1982 (he had started as a floor sweeper) when he acquired Curtis Mathes's manufacturing operations and turned them into Harvey Industries. Last July, Mr. Harvey acquired Curtis Mathes itself, since then ending its company-owned retailing but keeping its distribution operation.    Curtis Mathes sells its consumer-electronics products mostly through franchised dealers in small cities in the South and currently buys about one-third of Harvey's output. &quot;Properly managed, Curtis Mathes will develop more and more manufacturing business for us,&quot; Mr. Conley says.    But Curtis Mathes sales fell sharply in 1986 and 1987, and are down again this year because superstores are taking business from smaller dealers and Curtis Mathes models have had product-mix and pricing problems that Mr. Harvey is trying to correct. Mr. Harvey says, and dealers confirm, that his takeover of Curtis Mathes and subsequent moves, including some dealer price cuts of $60 to $70, have stimulated sales in the past three months.    Like Tokyo-based Sony, Curtis Mathes long has charged premium prices, claiming it offers superior quality. &quot;We sell service and peace of mind,&quot; says Ed McGuinness, director of franchise development. Curtis Mathes recently reinforced this strategy by extending product warranties to six years, from four, on most parts and labor. Rivals' warranties are typically a year on parts and 90 days on labor.    But dealers say Curtis Mathes's prices were high, sometimes 30% above those of rivals. Mr. McGuinness says the concern is aiming for premiums around 10%.    Mr. Harvey has cut Curtis Mathes's overhead, halving its payroll to about 100 workers and moving them to Athens from a Dallas suburb. Besides closing company stores, he is adding dealer outlets, now totaling 581. To draw dealers, Curtis Mathes, which had lost franchisees, ended a $25,000 franchise fee and began selling through nonexclusive outlets in many cities.    &quot;Curtis Mathes is turned around now and doing well,&quot; Mr. Harvey says, and Harvey Industries's sales are up. </TEXT></DOC>
