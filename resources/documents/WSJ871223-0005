But the reports are premature, according to analysts who watch OPEC's production.    &quot;We have seen no signs (of a decrease) whatsoever,&quot; said Keith Hamm, director of Petroleum Economics Ltd., a London-based consulting firm that monitors OPEC production and numbers among its clients several of the cartel's 13 members.    Nevertheless, the price of Brent, an important North Sea crude, was up 70 cents a barrel to $16.60 in late trading yesterday on the European spot market. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January crude contract rose $1.21 to close at $16.61 a barrel in heavy trading. Prices of heating oil and gasoline also soared.    Meanwhile, shares of several oil companies also rose as oil prices recovered after plunging about $4 a barrel in recent weeks.    Helping fuel yesterday's rise was an article in the Middle East Economic Survey published in Nicosia, Cyprus. According to the trade publication, which has close ties to Persian Gulf oil-producing countries, three prominent Middle East violators of OPEC production quotas -- the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq -- are preparing to reduce output by as much as 700,000 barrels a day.    As previously reported, oil ministers of both the Emirates and Kuwait pledged such cutbacks at the OPEC meeting that ended early last week in Vienna. But neither promised any action until the beginning of the new year. &quot;We are happy to start next year on quota,&quot; said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, after confirming Kuwait is currently producing 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day over its OPEC allocation.    In the Iraqi case, a senior oil official said in an interview at the OPEC meeting that Iraq's output, which he estimated at 2.8 million barrels a day, would continue at whatever level the &quot;market will take.&quot; But oil ministers from producing Arab countries supporting Iraq in its war against Iran held out hope that the Iraqis eventually would reduce output to avoid being singled out for blame if oil prices crashed. After failing to get an allotment matching Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day, as previously reported, Iraq refused to sign the OPEC agreement that maintains current quotas through the first six months of 1988.    Alone in OPEC, Abu Dhabi, chief emirate in the United Arab Emirates, has reduced production in recent weeks from near-record levels -- by design or because of lack of buyers for its oil. Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that is also a leading monitor of OPEC production, estimates Abu Dhabi output is now down to 1.1 million barrels a day from the 1.5 million barrels averaged as recently as November. But Dubai, another emirate, continues producing all-out at 400,000 barrels a day.    As a result, total United Arab Emirate production of 1.5 million barrels a day still is more than 50% above its OPEC quota. And the cutbacks in Abu Dhabi have been offset by Iraq's increases. Thus, total output for all OPEC continues unabated at about 18.6 million barrels a day, or two million barrels above the current production ceiling, according to Petro-Logistics.    Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics, said the Emirates have advised oil companies that orders for January purchases in Abu Dhabi should be based on output of 800,000 barrels a day. But Mr. Gerber is skeptical Abu Dhabi will be willing to reduce production that much. &quot;The proof of the pudding will be in the eating,&quot; he said.    Even so, total OPEC production is expected to decline some early next year -- either because of voluntary reductions by the cartel's more prominent quota violators or simply because they can't sell as much oil with refiners' storage tanks generally brimful. Oil economists project demand for OPEC oil in the 1988 first quarter at only around 17 million barrels a day. But Mr. Gerber estimated OPEC production for January still will be at least 18 million barrels a day. &quot;That is far too much,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a disaster.&quot;    In the oil markets, traders also reacted to word of an Iraqi attack on four tankers carrying Iranian oil and an expected industry report of lower-than-normal heating oil supplies.    Heating-oil and gasoline prices soared by their two-cent-a-gallon limits for February and later delivery. January-delivery contracts, which have no limits, rose even more: Heating oil was up 2.62 cents to 51.97 cents, and gasoline rose 2.88 cents to 44.16 cents.    After yesterday's rally, traders received more bullish news when the American Petroleum Institute, in its weekly statistics, released after the market closed, reported drops in U.S. crude-oil and heating-oil stockpiles. In particular, estimated heating oil stocks fell almost 1% for the week ended Friday from the previous week, to stand at 128.4 million barrels, compared with 152.3 million barrels in stock this time last year.    Andrew Lebow, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said technical factors also helped the surge. &quot;The market was oversold; it needed a corrective phase,&quot; he said. Many speculators sold contracts at last week's low levels caused by the disappointing OPEC meeting, and bought quickly as soon as the market showed it wasn't going any lower yesterday.    &quot;I'm surprised at the extent of the rise,&quot; Mr. Lebow said. &quot;It may be that the market is telling us a move toward $12 oil might be premature. It might be possible the market needs to do work before $12.&quot;    The upward move in New York followed a rally early in the day on European markets. Various OPEC-related rumors, the Iraqi attack on the Iranian tankers and standard pre-Christmas buying activity contributed to the European price strength.    Meanwhile, responding to last week's oil price plunge, Mobil Corp. said it lowered the price it will pay for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, by 50 cents, to $16.50 a barrel. </TEXT></DOC>
