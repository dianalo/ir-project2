VHS-Beta. Rated R. For rental market.)      This is a really inferior film.   Like others of the teen-age slice-and-dice genre, ``Halloween5'' requires a knowledge of the series to know what's going on. Itnever really suggests what the heck it is Michael's avenging.   No great loss, for the cinematic slaughter of sexuallyprecocious teen-agers has become as stylized as Jacobean tragedy.   ``Halloween 5'' is set in the curiously empty suburb that hasmore than its share of nubile teen-agers with too much disposableincome. It opens with a flashback of Michael being run over by acar and blown down a handy abandoned mineshaft, his chest full ofbuckshot from the shotguns of the never-prompt police.   ``One Year Later'' the subtitle says, and we dissolve towaiflike 9-year-old Jamie, a traumatic mute and inmate of the localhome for disturbed children. She is reliving the psychologicaldomination of Michael, her uncle and, um, psychic twin, that droveher to juke her step-Mommy in the bathtub.   Her visitors are perky, attractive teen-age girls who arefriends or relatives or something, blithely preparing for a teenHalloween party.   That's right, a Halloween party in a town that has seen so muchannual slaughter on the night that anywhere else the streets wouldbe crowded with police, National Guardsmen and reporters anglingfor the ``Haddonfield: One Year After Slaughter'' story.   Ah, but we're not here for logic. We're here for the numbinglypredictable series of false starts, cheap frights and intermittent,painstakingly overdubbed stabbings that lead up to Michael's realhorror.   In ``5,'' as in ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3'' and ``4,'' Michael's task isto murder teen-agers who indulge in casual sex. That's the point ofthis movie, kids. Make love and you die. Kiss, kiss, hack, hack,stab, chop, die.   This is the 1990s, though, and the socially responsiblefilmmakers of ``Halloween 5'' give us this line at an intimatemoment: She says, ``I didn't ... BRING ... anything ...'' and heproduces a condom.   ``Halloween 5'' was written by Michael Jacobs, Shem Bittermanand Dominique Othenin-Girard, and directed by Othenin-Girard. MaybeMichael could go after them in ``Halloween 6.''   What's alarming about this unfrightening, stupid teen screamer,though, is that its real heroine is a 9-year-old girl. And thatmeans the makers of this product are relying on cable and theubiquitous videocassette to get ``Halloween 5'' before an evenyounger audience.   Now THAT'S scary.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Renegades'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)      Don't waste your time on Lou Diamond Phillips and KieferSutherland's ``buddy movie,'' which strings together witless chasescenes, cartoon violence and surreal gunfights that blow everythingaway.   Phillips plays the young Indian who accompanies a sacred Lakotaartifact to a museum in Philadelphia. Sutherland plays the youngpoliceman trying to infiltrate a young mobster's gang.   During a botched jewel robbery in which the policeman is anunwilling participant, the spear is stolen and the Indian's brotheris killed. Thus the two are joined in a mutual quest, their initialhostility and mistrust eventually growing into ... aw, you know.   The movie gets unlikelier, but to cite the improbabilities wouldopen this reviewer to a charge of sarcasm. Writer David Rich anddirector Jack Sholder certainly didn't have irony in mind.   Boring.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
