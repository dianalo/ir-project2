Menes, director of the department'soffice of finance, industry and trade information. But sincethe report was prepared, many private economists, who say thecountry is in a recession, have become increasinglypessimistic about the country's economic prospects.   The study, a series of forecasts for specific industriesprepared by more than 100 department analysts, makes certainassumptions about the future of the U.S. economy. Inparticular, it assumes that real growth in 1991 will bebetween 1% and 3%, with the &quot;most likely case being growth atthe lower end of that range.&quot; In the first three quarters of1990, economic growth averaged about 1.3%.   Among manufacturing businesses, the report said most ofthe high-technology and health-related industries willcontinue to outperform the rest of the economy. It forecasts8.9% growth in 1991 in the semiconductor and relatedindustries and expects computer industry shipments toincrease by 6% during the year. Medical instruments, suppliesand appliance businesses also are projected to grow at ratesof between 7% and 9% in 1991. Leather tanning and finishing,with a projected 9.4% growth rate in 1991, should outperformmost manufacturing businesses.   But there are laggards as well. Motor vehicles andconstruction &quot;will experience negative growth&quot; in 1991, Mr.Farren said. Manufacturers of butter, mobile homes and frozenbaked goods -- other than bread -- will be hit particularlyhard, the report said.   The aircraft industry, including engines and parts --which was the boom manufacturing business during the pastyear -- will experience a 4.6% growth rate in 1991, downsharply from 17.9% in 1990. But the aerospace industry isexpected to have a record 1991 trade surplus of $31 billion,up from more than $28 billion in 1990. Machine toolproduction also is expected to continue to be strong, with apredicted 5% growth rate in 1991, after a 5.3% rise in 1990.   In service industries, the strongest sectors will beelectronic information, computer software and dataprocessing, with revenues growing as much as between 16% and20%, according to the report.   Despite the report's predictions for continued sluggishgrowth, many private economists paint an even gloomierpicture. They say the economy is in a recession, with noguarantee that it will perk up before late 1991. Recession iscommonly defined by economists as at least two consecutivequarters of negative growth.   Generally, the Commerce Department's industrial outlook isbased partly on midsummer economic projections released bythe Office of Management and Budget. This year, however, theAug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with the subsequent turmoilin oil and other markets, forced the department to use arevised set of economic assumptions prepared in August. Ingeneral, the department's analysts &quot;assumed that the economywould avoid a recession, though a soft economic environmentwould persist into the first half of 1991, followed by agradual pickup,&quot; according to J. Antonio Villamil, thedepartment's chief economist.   The report's assumptions project an inflation rate ofbetween 4% and 4.5% for 1991, down slightly from 4.5% to 5%in 1990. They also assume a slight reduction in interestrates, with the Treasury bill rate falling to between 6.8% to7.2% in 1991, from between 7.2% to 7.5% in 1990, while the10-year Treasury note rate would fall to a 1991 range of 8.0%to 8.5% from between 8.5% to 9.0% in 1990. According to thereport, the unemployment rate may pick up slightly to between5.5% to 6.5% in 1991 from between 5.5% and 6% in 1990. Thereport also assumed a 1991 oil price of $25 a barrel.   These projections, which were prepared in recent months,are already somewhat dated. The administration will soonrelease its economic report of the president, which willinclude more current economic forecasts for 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
