Theyare victims of open and vicious discrimination, and aresubject to mental-health bureaucracies that force them into&quot;treatment&quot; that often consists of idly sitting around anunderstaffed and overcrowded public-hospital ward.   A handful of advocates called Protection and Advocacyagencies, supported by a pittance of federal funds, defendsthe human rights of people with mental illness and seeks anincrease in community resources so that people with mentalillness can live better lives.</LP><TEXT>   Now along comes Rael Jean Isaac (&quot;Protect the Mentally IllFrom Their Advocates,&quot; editorial page, May 7) urging Congressto kill the Pandamp;As. Like the know-nothing attackers of legalservices for the poor, Mrs. Isaac distorts what theseagencies do and what their mission is. They are charged byCongress to protect the rights of people with mental illnessand to fight abuse and neglect. And that is what they do, allover the country:   In Arizona, Pandamp;A litigated to force the state and Phoenixto provide housing and comprehensive services to people withserious mental illness.   In Massachusetts, Pandamp;A is fighting the drastic cuts inservices to those with serious mental illness.   In Alabama, Pandamp;A is seeking, as guardian for a class ofemotionally disturbed children in foster care, to force thedevelopment of services to strengthen and preserve families.   In New York, Pandamp;A brought action to end discrimination byMedicaid in funding medications for mentally ill people.   And in Montana, with the assistance of my organization(not a Protection and Advocacy agency) Pandamp;A is challengingabuses in the state hospital so appalling that the localwatchdog agency compared it with a 19th-century institution:housing civilly committed patients in prison cells, placingpatients in five-point mechanical restraints or lockedseclusion for days at a time and allowing direct-care-staffintimidation of patients. All the while, the mental-healthgroups Mrs. Isaac extolls stand idly by.   When one pierces Mrs. Isaac's rhetoric, what really seemsto gall her is that advocates actually listen to patients andtry to obtain the remedies they seek. For a minusculeinvestment, Congress found a way to help many mentally illpeople obtain the services they need and the advocacy theydeserve. It should continue to support the Pandamp;As.   Leonard S. Rubenstein   Director   Mental Health Law Project   Washington   ---   Mrs. Isaac represents a laudable attempt to inform readersof serious problems in federally funded Protection andAdvocacy programs in many states. At a time when there aremore suffering, untreated people with serious mentalillnesses in our communities than ever before, the priorityof some programs appears to be in assisting the mentally illto avoid the treatments they so desperately need to alleviatetheir suffering. As Mrs. Isaac accurately states, theNational Alliance for the Mentally Ill is horrified, but, no,we are not helpless.   The NAMI Board has decided to attempt to repair, notabolish, the program. We are working -- in the face ofopposition from the Pandamp;A lobby -- for changes in the law thatwould require family and consumer representation on thegoverning boards. In some states, these programs work closelywith our members in seeking positive changes in the systemsof treatment and rehabilitation serving mentally ill people.It is our desire to replicate these model efforts in all 50states. As family members we are ultimately responsible forthe well-being of our loved ones.   Thomas M. Posey   President   National Alliance for the Mentally Ill   Arlington, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
