<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0957 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method has been developed for calculating changes in annual electricityconsumption and hourly loads in the residential sector resulting fromthe implementation of one or more energy conservation measures in a utilityservice area. The methodology was used to evaluate different measuresby comparing their impacts in three service areas with differing loadcharacteristics. The measures included improvements to the thermal integrityof the building, increased appliance efficiencies, as well as combinationsof these measures. Three service areas were selected that differed widelyin their climatic conditions, appliance saturations, and other householdcharacteristics. The conservation measures were evaluated by comparingtheir impacts on electricity sales and on peak summer and winter loads.The measures were ranked on the basis of a figure-of-merit related totheir ability to reduce peak loads relative to electricity consumption.These results can be used to determine the financial impact of the measureson electric utilities. 5 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
