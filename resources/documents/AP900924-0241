She was thrilled to work with such directors as John Schlesingerand Sir David Lean, and amazed she had the courage to arrive on theset each day. But don't expect her to recite dialogue from thosemovies.   Now 49, and feeling much calmer, the Academy Award winner andicon of 1960s ``Swinging London'' prefers to think of the locationswhere she made the films. There's India, the setting for ``Heat andDust''; Canada, where she made ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller''; andIreland, which provided Christie with happy memories of the recent``Fools of Fortune.''   ``The Irish are the most generous people, the most wonderfulpeople,'' she said enthusiastically, looking relaxed in a blue knitshirt, her blond hair cheerfully uncombed. A children's birthdaycelebration goes on in another room of a friend's Manhattanapartment where Christie stays when she's in town.   ``It makes you happy, the touches of kindness that you get everysingle day. It makes you happy to be there because people are soextraordinarily nice. It sounds patronizing, doesn't it? The Irishhave an incredibly nice nature, and they haven't got ananti-English bias, though they have every right to.''   Christie is very much the well-traveled performer, veteran ofstage, screen and Warren Beatty. Even growing up, home waswhereever they built the set. She was born in India, but spent herchildhood at a series of English boarding schools, findingcontentment by performing in school plays.   She lived for a year in Paris and established herself in filmsin 1963 with a brief appearance in Schlesinger's ``Billy Liar.''Christie topped it two years later by winning a best actress Oscarfor ``Darling,'' playing the shallow, free-spirited London modelwho tells her life story to a reporter for a woman's magazine.   ``You just think they made a terrible mistake,'' she said of theAcademy Award. ``You feel terrible because you can't believe it'shappening. You're just thinking, `What am I doing there? What thehell am I doing there?'   ``For a long time I didn't put it anywhere; a friend of mine hadit. I was too embarrassed by it. What a stupid cow I was! Then Igrew up a little bit more and thought, `Wonderful, look what I'vegot,' '' she said, sounding just like a gleeful as kid who justfound a $5 bill.   After starring as Lara in ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Christie traveledsome more. She lived in California during the 1970s and worked withBeatty, her boyfriend for several years and co-star of ``Shampoo,''``Heavan Can Wait'' and ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' shot inVancouver, British Columbia.   ```McCabe' was a wonderful location because (director) RobertAltman made it a wonderful location. We were shooting nights inVancouver and it was where people who didn't want to go to theVietnam War went instead,'' she said.   ``It was a very vital place, a wonderful place. All these peoplewere living in the mountains, very self-sufficient. And Robert gotthem to be the townspeople. They built everything from day one.Some of them ended up living on the sets during the shooting.''   She moved back to England at the end of the '70s, becameincreasingly outspoken politically - and traveled. She made theacclaimed ``Heat and Dust,'' returning to her native India, andworked in Argentina for ``Miss Mary,'' a commercial flop but apersonal success.   ``There's an interesting thing about being British and havingcome from an enormous empire country. You go to countries likeArgentina which suffered appallingly from English imperialism. Theysee someone from Britain as a continuation of that imperialism. Ihad to get over their reticence.   ``Coming to the United States I'm aware of that same feeling theArgentines had. I get the same feeling of people feeling superiorto everyone else, just in little drops. Remarks here and there, anattitude that people don't know as much in the backward countries.It's a superiority complex that all great empires have.''   In ``Fools of Fortune,'' based on the novel by William Trevor,Christie plays the English wife of an Irishman murdered by Britishmilitary police during the Irish Republicans' uprising after WorldWar I. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Iain Glen also star.   Christie takes an emotional trip in ``Fools of Fortune,'' warmand outgoing at the beginning of the film, embittered andincreasingly unstable after her husband's murder.   If in person Christie seems closer to the life-affirming womanof the film's first half, as an actress she related to the angry,single-minded personality of the second half, a world travelerunafraid to cross boundaries of any kind.   ``There's a scene that's missing which I wished had been in,''she said. ``She talks to her son and explains her family had alwaysbeen involved with the struggle for home rule for Ireland. Sheexplains for a Protestant-English person, that is an extremelyunusual thing.   ``I identified with that anger and injustice. Her heartbreak andrage that the man who killed her husband was receiving noretribution at all. What is it like to go through a transition likethat woman went through? You go through sort of a journey. The workis really a journey.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Oct. 5-7</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
