The nation's biggest banks boosted their base lending rates by ahalf percentage point to 10.5 percent on Monday, the highest levelsince mid-1985 and the fourth boost this year.   Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recentweeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been risingdue to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreignexchange.   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to haveheld back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chiefeconomist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,including interest it pays on savings accounts or certificates ofdeposit, and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates.   The rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis forcalculating interest on corporate loans and for determining manytypes of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, such as homeequity loans.   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowingcosts in December or early next year,'' said William V. Sullivan, aneconomist for the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   But some economists said it was unclear whether the rate hikeadversely would affect the economy, specifically consumer buyinghabits during the important holiday season.   James L. Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill LynchCapital Markets Inc., said, ``I think the direct effect is prettysmall because generally consumers aren't affected by modestincreases in interest rates ...''   But Yardeni said some consumers might cut back on spending and``buy only things that they can afford.''   ``There's an underlying sense of uneasiness because so manypeople have been through rough times even when the economy wasstrong. The prime rate hike coming into the Christmas season maymake people more cautious,'' he said.   The financial markets had no major reaction to Monday'sannouncement. Stock and bond prices rose modestly, while the dollarfirmed against other major currencies in foreign exchange.   Sullivan said the markets also are prepared for further increasesin interest rates.   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned ofhigher short-term rates unless lawmakers work to trim the hugefederal budget deficit, a key factor in the recent weakening of thedollar.   ``There's a building perception in the marketplace that the Fedis, in fact, tightening conditions ...,'' Sullivan said.   Sullivan and other economists predicted the Fed might soon raiseits discount rate, or the interest it charges on loans to banks, andif that happens, the banks might raise rates again.   ``I'd look for something (from the Fed) in the next two weeks,''said Yardeni.   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to announce the primehike Monday and several other major banks joined the move.   The prime stood at 8.5 percent at the beginning of this year andthe banks have raised it four times since then. Monday's increaseput the key lending rate at its highest level since May 20, 1985,when the banks lowered it a half percentage point to 10 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
