In Jerusalem, shrieks, scuffles and a cry of ``Death to allterrorists!'' disrupted the funeral of Shlomo Cohen, a 21-year-oldsoldier who was stabbed to death Saturday as he walked unarmed nearJerusalem's walled Old City.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin blamed the Palestine LiberationOrganization for Cohen's death and the suspected kidnapping ofanother Israeli soldier, Sgt. Avi Sasportaz, who has been missingfor three days.   ``The two incidents, it is not possible that they were notorganized by a group and I believe that it was connected to a terrorgroup,'' Rabin said on Israel radio. ``Read that as the PLO.''   ``I recommend to those overseas, who cling to the foot of (PLOchairman Yasser) Arafat, the PLO is terror,'' he said. ``The PLO hasnot rejected terror, both in Israel and outside.''   Thousands of soldiers, police and civilian volunteers continuedthe search for Sasportaz on Sunday, and his mother Rachel issued animpassioned plea on Israel radio, begging the kidnappers to ``Pleasegive me him alive, don't kill him.''   The three-day general strike to demand an independent Palestineis the longest work stoppage called by pro-PLO underground leaderssince Palestinians began their 14-month-old revolt against Israel'soccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Arab news reports said the first strike day was fully observed.But Israel radio said some Palestinian workers showed up for jobs inIsrael.   Soldiers trying to prevent stoning attacks Sunday clamped curfewson three neighborhoods and refugee camps in the Gaza Strip,confining 45,000 Palestinians to their homes, and sealed off 13alleys in the Khan Yunis refugee camp.   Sporadic protests erupted, however, and troops were stoned andresponded with gunfire in at least three incidents, wounding elevenpeople, according to Arab reports.   The army confirmed five of the wounded and said it wasinvestigating the other incidents.   In Jerusalem, 1,000 mourners held an emotional military funeralfor Cohen, who was on leave and in civilian clothes when he wasattacked.   ``We see that the people of the PLO and their supporters speakwith knives,'' Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir told mourners.   No Palestinian group has claimed responsibility for the killing.   ``Jewish blood cannot be spilled without being avenged!'' shoutedone man, among a few people who disrupted the service for about 10minutes. Other mourners tried to calm down protesters, who finallywere removed by police.   Cohen, a former seminary student, was the 16th Israeli killedsince the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. At least 383 Palestinianshave been killed in that time.   In another development:   _Israel radio said an 18-year-old Palestinian jailed for securityoffenses was found stabbed to death in Beersheba prison in southernIsrael. Police believe he was killed by another Arab inmate for asyet unknown reasons, the radio said.   _Israel ordered prominent Arab journalist Samaan Khouri detainedfor six months without trial after he participated in recentmeetings with left-wing Israelis. Khouri works part-time for AgenceFrance Presse news agency and was detained for 4{ months as asuspected PLO activist last year.</TEXT></DOC>
