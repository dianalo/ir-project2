The U.S., Germany and Britain have sketched out a seriesof steps in recent meetings to co-opt Mr. Gorbachev'shardline critics in the military and defense industry. Theaim is to give these conservative Soviet institutions a stakein reforming the economy and building stronger ties to theWest.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials plan to discuss this latest approach toMoscow during meetings in Washington this week with GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl. The strategy will be unveiled in aseries of major allied meetings in Europe scheduled toculminate in the July summit in London of the Group of Sevenleading industrial democracies. Mr. Kohl is expected to leanon a reluctant President Bush to look for a way to invite Mr.Gorbachev to meet with allied leaders during the Londonsummit.   The new approach isn't fully worked out, and debatescontinue within and among Western governments about it. Thereis wariness, especially in the U.S., Japan and Britain, aboutpouring large sums into the U.S.S.R., as Germany advocates.But the U.S. has sided with Bonn and against London on thecrucial question of aiming the new initiatives at theU.S.S.R. Britain wanted to restrict the effort to EastEurope, as in the past.   The effort has been fueled in part by conversationsbetween senior Bush administration officials and a youngSoviet reform economist named Grigory Yavlinsky, whosimultaneously advises both Mr. Gorbachev and his rival,Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He is co-author, withGorbachev aide Yevgeni Primakov, of a letter sent to theGroup of Seven that calls for strong Soviet moves toward amarket system in return for aid and advice from the West.   Mr. Yavlinsky has been urging the West to reach out to thehard-line elements in the U.S.S.R. most hostile to marketreforms and the opening to the West.   That idea has found support in Washington. Undersecretaryof State Robert Zoellick, who also is the counselor toSecretary of State James Baker, has told Congress, &quot;We shouldexpand our range of contacts with other important groups inthe Soviet Union, including the military and the defenseindustrial sector.&quot;   He conceded that these groups &quot;have been associated withthe rightward swing in Soviet policy making.&quot; But he addedthat &quot;no Soviet leader will be able to ignore the military'sconcern about housing and jobs for the troops withdrawn fromCentral and Eastern Europe. No economic reform program willbe politically successful if it does not address the fears ofthe skilled and influential workers in the defense-industrialsector.&quot;   &quot;Contacts with us can help lead some of those nottraditionally associated with the reform movement torecognize the potential benefits of reform,&quot; Mr. Zoellicksaid.   The U.S. and Germany have agreed to propose a number ofsteps to draw the Soviet military-industrial complex into theWestern orbit. For instance, they will propose that the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization dispatch expert teams to theU.S.S.R. to help convert Soviet weapons plants to civilianuse. The Bush administration also has been quietly discussingthe matter with Japan's Ministry of International Trade andIndustry.   The U.S.-German plan also envisions inviting Sovietmilitary representatives to join in certain NATO activities,such as planning for civil emergencies. Sovietrepresentatives also would be invited to review NATO's newmilitary strategy and to participate in seminars, trainingprograms, and other events at NATO headquarters.   The two nations even plan to invite the U.S.S.R. and itsformer satellites to set up &quot;Atlantic councils&quot; in theircapitals to foster cordial trans-Atlantic relations.   It's anybody's guess whether these modest steps will havethe desired result. But the Central Intelligence Agencywarned last week that the U.S.S.R. was heading for economic&quot;disaster,&quot; and there is a growing sense in Westerngovernments that some effort must be made to head that off.</TEXT></DOC>
