He added: &quot;Everyone is waiting for a revaluation of the deutsche mark. The weak currencies are trying to wait for this adjustment and not have to devalue on their own.&quot;    For weeks, the French franc, in particular, has come under intense pressure from the steadily falling U.S. dollar, forecasts that the mark will be revalued after Germany's Jan. 25 national election and a deteriorating political environment in France.    The EMS was established in March 1979 to help achieve greater economic and monetary coordination among members of the Common Market. The exchange-rate mechanism currently includes the currencies of eight of the 12 Common Market nations; Britain, Greece, Spain and Portugal don't belong to the mechanism.    Under the mechanism, seven of the currencies may not move against one another by more than 2.25% above or below agreed-upon central rates. The eighth currency, the Italian lira, is permitted a 6% band.    A country is obligated to intervene in the foreign-exchange market to keep its currency within the bands. It can also raise or lower interest rates to help stay within the bands; interest-rate revisions alter a currency's attractiveness by increasing or reducing the returns on investments in that currency.    If these steps aren't successful, a nation can request a realignment of the rates.    A weakening dollar often upsets the semi-rigid alignments of the EMS, because international investors selling the U.S. unit usually prefer assets denominated in the mark. Thus, demand for the German currency is significantly higher than that for other European currencies.    A dealer at a major German bank described the current strains within the EMS as stemming more from strong world-wide demand for marks than from the weakness of the franc.    At the same time, in the current case of the franc, &quot;it seems there is less consensus in France than there used to be,&quot; noted Michel Lutfalla, chief economist for Credit du Nord in Paris.    The conservative government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac is being challenged by a two-week-old railway strike, although railroad workers in some cities voted over the weekend to return to work. French seamen voted during the weekend to end a separate, 26-day work stoppage, but miners remain on strike and unions are calling one-day strikes for today and Wednesday at state naval dockyards. Walkouts in the electricity and gas industries and Paris transit system are planned for tomorrow.    In mid-December, student protests forced the government to abandon plans to reorganize the country's university system.    On Friday, the mark climbed to a record 3.3120 francs in Paris, just under its EMS ceiling of 3.3303 francs. Traders estimated that the French central bank sold about $40 million and 30 million marks in European markets to keep the French currency from falling further.    The French central bank also raised its money-market intervention rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 8%. &quot;They're trying to squeeze the speculation&quot; against the franc, a trader said. Last Tuesday, the central bank increased its seven-day securities-repurchase rate, and on Wednesday, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the country &quot;would take every measure to defend the franc.&quot;    Analysts noted that the currencies of Denmark, Belgium and Ireland are also under pressure. And at times, even the Dutch have intervened to support the guilder, they said.    Ironically, French economic fundamentals aren't bad. &quot;In normal times we'd be a normal or average currency,&quot; said Mr. Lutfalla of Credit du Nord.    Mr. Luftalla noted that at 2%, annual French inflation is at its lowest since 1967; that French wage increases have been held below 4% a year, &quot;which is under what the Germans have at present&quot;; and that France had a 1986 current account surplus of about $3.1 billion.    France's short-term economic policy, Mr. Lutfalla explained, is to hold down wages to improve corporate profits and maintain employment in the current climate of relatively slow economic growth. He described the government's medium-term to long-term policy as one of less state interference in the economy and increased private savings to &quot;provide more growth in the future.&quot;    But analysts noted that to succeed, such policies require a strong social consensus and patience -- traits that the current labor unrest indicates are lacking.    Traders and economists predicted that the speculative pressure for an EMS realignment will continue, if for no other reason than that the dollar is expected to keep falling.    &quot;There will be intense pressure on Germany to do something -- either to decrease their interest rates or revalue the deutsche mark,&quot; predicted Mr. Lutfalla. &quot;There will be a few rumbles coming across the Rhine that the Germans should act before (Jan.) 25th.&quot;    Even so, most analysts expect Germany to delay action until after the national election. They noted that the Bonn government has little appetite for further damaging its export industries, particularly against its major trading partners.    After the election, some economists, such as Mr. Develle of Paribas, expect a rise of between 4% and 5% in the mark's value against the franc in a general EMS realignment. France and other countries whose currencies are weak would prefer an upward revaluation of the mark, rather than a devaluation of their currencies, but Mr. Develle believes some combination of the two is possible.    Mr. Develle added that Germany could be prompted to lower interest rates if the dollar falls to 1.80 marks. He predicted that after the election, Bonn &quot;will try to attain a gentleman's agreement with the U.S. (on the dollar-mark rate) similar to that between the U.S. and Japan.&quot; In the fall, Washington and Tokyo issued a vaguely worded statement implying an agreement to stabilize the dollar-yen rate.    An upward revaluation of the mark, some German bankers noted, would also help the German central bank slow money-supply growth, which last year expanded 7.8%, higher than the target of between 3.5% and 5.5%.    For its part, France will resist pressure to devalue the franc until at least after Jan. 25, analysts predicted. Noting that the franc was effectively devalued by 5.8% against the mark last April, David F. Lomax, group economic adviser for National Westminster Bank in London, said, &quot;Chirac wouldn't want to be a double devaluer within a year. His credibility is on the line with the student riots&quot; and the current labor unrest.    Mr. Lutfalla noted that besides there being little economic justification for a franc devaluation, it could trigger additional problems, such as adding to French inflationary expectations at a time when oil prices are rising and derailing recent economic liberalization measures. &quot;A devaluation is always a sign that your economic policy hasn't succeeded,&quot; he said.    ---   Friday's Dollar Activity   The dollar was mixed against other major currencies Friday in light volume.    The currency firmed late in the day as traders covered short positions to guard against possible intervention by Japan or West Germany next week to support the dollar, Dan Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. in New York, said.    In Tokyo, the Japanese central bank governor said the bank will continue to intervene in the currency markets this year to stabilize the yen. In an interview with Kyodo news service, Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, said: &quot;It is necessary to continue policy coordination with each of the industrialized countries this year, and as a result the stabilization of exchange rates can be expected.&quot;    The U.S. and Japan agreed on Oct. 31 that the yen-dollar rate had become &quot;broadly consistent with the present underlying fundamentals.&quot; Despite currency-market speculation, U.S. officials said then that the accord didn't imply any commitment by the two sides to maintain exchange rates at the certain levels. They said that the U.S. and Japan didn't have a target for the exchange rate and that the U.S. didn't plan to intervene to maintain the rate.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
