Early efforts were entitledde minimis and were aimed at establishing a philosophical basis and radiationdose limits. The main objectives of more recent work on exemption areto illustrate a method for developing practical radiological criteria,to establish generic criteria, and to determine the practicability ofthe preliminary exemption principles. The method used to develop thecriteria relies on models to evaluate the potential radiation exposurepathways and scenarios for individuals and population groups potentiallypresent following the unrestricted release of materials. This paper describesthe assessment methods, presents the generic results expressed in termsof the limiting concentrations of selected radionuclides in municipalwaste, and provides a comparison with recent regulatory efforts in theUnited States for considering selected wastes being Below RegulatoryConcern (BRC). 17 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
