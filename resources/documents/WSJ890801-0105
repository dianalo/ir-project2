Dodge Group said.    For the first six months of 1989, new construction contracting was off 1% from last year's first-half level, the unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. said. Despite the weakening in May and June, the second quarter's total was slightly above that of the first quarter.    &quot;We've been seeing more than the usual volatility in contracting during the first half of 1989, but on balance, there's been surprisingly little slowdown from the strong 1987-1988 pace of building,&quot; said George A. Christie, Dodge's vice president and chief economist. &quot;Having weathered another period of monetary restraint, this time without serious damage, the construction sector's prospects for this year's second half are good.&quot;    The Dodge Index, which is seasonally adjusted and tracks total levels of construction contracting, slipped to 159 in June from 162 in May. It uses a base of 100 in 1982.    Like the dollar level of contracting, Mr. Christie said, the index &quot;suggests more stability than continuing decline from its peak in mid-1987.&quot; For the second quarter, the index was at an average 161, up from 151 in the first quarter. In August 1987, it reached a record high of 174.    Total construction contracting in 1989 will ease 2% to about $254 billion from $258 billion last year, Dodge had estimated in a separate report issued last month. &quot;An interest-rate retreat&quot; is stimulating residential building, an important part of total construction, it said. Previous Dodge forecasts anticipated a steeper decline than 2% in 1989.    In June, the nonbuilding construction sector, representing publicly funded works and utilities, set a weak pace for the month's overall construction contracting. The category showed a 5% decline to an annualized $43.6 billion. June slumped in comparison with May when a big electric power distribution project began in New York.    In the second quarter, nonbuilding construction averaged $47.1 billion, 3% over the annualized rate of the first quarter.    Nonresidential projects in June slipped 3% from May, to about $89.9 billion. The downturn was somewhat anticipated because a surge of new contracts was recorded in May, Dodge said.    Second-quarter nonresidential construction contracting was 2% higher than in the first quarter. Residential building was relatively flat in June compared with May. Contracting stood at an annualized $116.2 billion in June.    &quot;It is still too early to be looking for a recovery of new-home construction in response to falling mortgage rates,&quot; Mr. Christie said. &quot;It is encouraging, though, to see that sales of new homes have picked up since early spring.&quot;    Second-quarter residential contracting stabilized at an average of $120.3 billion.    The unadjusted total of construction contracting for the six months was $127.3 billion, 1% less than the same period of 1988.    By type of contracting, nonresidential building totaled $43.3 billion for the first half, 1% above 1988's six-month total. Residential building was short of its comparable 1988 level by 1% at $60.2 billion. And nonbuilding construction was off 5% from the year-earlier period at $23.8 billion.    The North Central region maintained a 1% lead over last year's first half and the Northeast was about even. The West was off 1% and the South was down 3%.    ---@ a-June '89 Seasonally @ Construction Adjusted % @ Contract Val. Change From @ (000,000) Prev.
