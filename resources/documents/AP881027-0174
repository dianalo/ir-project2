Prison, FreedUnharmed</HEAD><BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two convicted murderers held hostage acounselor and a teacher's aide at a state prison for several hoursThursday in an attempt to get transferred to another prison,authorities said.   Both hostages were released unharmed and the inmates, armed withsharpened metal rods, surrendered peacefully, said Capt. RobertBaker of the state Department of Corrections.   Annette Martin, 46, a teaching assistant, and Joan Mason, 51, avocational counselor, both of Newark, were taken hostage at 9:07a.m. as they conducted a teaching demonstration in the library ofthe year-old Northern State Prison.   Mrs. Martin was released at 1:34 p.m. and Ms. Mason was takenfrom the library on a stretcher at 4:06 p.m., ending nearly sevenhours as a hostage.   Negotiators spent hours talking through a metal mesh window tothe inmates, who used the women as shields.   ``There were repeated threats that they were prepared to doviolence to the hostages,'' said Gary Hilton, deputy correctionscommissioner. He said the women were ``emotionally battered'' butnot physically harmed.   The only demands from inmates Angel Guzman, 26, and EdwardRobinson, 27, were that they be transferred to a federal prisonoutside New Jersey and that officials take no reprisals for thehostage taking, said Corrections spokesman James Stabile.   ``The negotiators agreed that the grievances of the two inmateswould be reviewed,'' Hilton said. Robinson also asked to be allowedto call his mother, a demand Hilton said would be granted.   He said Guzman and Robinson will be transferred Thursday toanother state prison.   Mrs. Martin's husband, Isaac, said in a telephone interview thathe learned of his wife's plight from a noon radio broadcast. ``Ijust had to pray that it would come to a happy ending,'' Martin said.   Hilton described the inmates as longtime friends who had beenimprisoned at Riverfront State Prison in Camden before beingtransferred to Northern State Prison about two weeks ago.   Guzman of Woodbine was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 1982for murdering his uncle during an argument over $70. Robinson ofCamden was sentenced to life in prison in 1979 for shooting hisvictim in the back of the head. Prison records did not give detailsof the case.   Northern State Prison is a medium security prison that holdsabout 1,000 inmates in six two-story units. The $18 million complexopened in May 1987.   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, who went to the prison after learningof the hostage taking, said he was unaware that the lockup housedmurderers. The state has two maximum security prisons near Rahwayand Trenton.   Hilton said it was not unusual for murderers to be kept at amedium security prison.</TEXT></DOC>
