The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to2,688.78.   Losing issues outpaced gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwidetrading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 892 issuesdown, 595 up and 484 unchanged.   Trading activity was generally sluggish throughout the session.Big Board volume totaled 147.27 million shares, down from 153.77million in Tuesday's session.   Bank stocks took the biggest hit, reflecting disappointment overthe recent mixed signals by the Federal Reserve as well as thedecision by Southwest Bank of St. Louis to raise its prime rateback to 10.5 percent. The small Midwestern bank, which often leadsprime rate moves by bigger banks, had cut the rate to 10 percentrecently.   ``This certainly doesn't bode well for the short-term,'' saidJack Baker, head of block trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   The Fed confused the financial markets by first letting keyshort-term interest rates fall last week, which led analysts toconclude that the central bank was easing credit to stimulate theeconomy. But Monday, the Fed sent a strong signal that it wasn'teasing credit. Stock prices nonetheless had advanced in theprevious two sessions.   The market came under pressure at the opening bell Wednesdayfrom profit-takers anxious to cash in on the recent gains. Ahandful of blue-chip issues led a narrow rally by midday but thebroader market did not follow and the gains were quickly erased.   Two separate reports that showed an upward revision in the GrossNational Product and lower corporate profits in the third quarterwere generally overlooked by investors.   The government reported that the economy grew at an annual rateof 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5percent previously forecast. And corporate profits fell 7.2 percentin the July-September period, a second report showed.   Some Wall Street analysts attributed the market's sluggishnessto a pause after the recent runup in stock prices. The Dow JonesIndustrial Average gained nearly 70 points in the last five tradingsessions.   ``We're looking for a year-end rally. But to make itworthwhile...we need to work off the overbought conditions byperhaps going lower,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, equities analystwith A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, includingtrades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in theover-the-counter market, totaled 179.40 million shares.
