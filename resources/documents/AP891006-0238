Brumley, former general counsel in the CommerceDepartment.   Brumley testified at a hearing Thursday of the House SmallBusiness subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities andenergy. The Washington-based attorney said government officials areignorant of the laws encouraging the private use ofgovernment-developed technology.   ``It's not understood as a matter of public policy,'' he said.``It's that simple.''   He said that ignorance had to be overcome before his officecould make sure the international agreement on the space stationprotected the rights of U.S. contractors and subcontractors whenforeign partners begin to take commercial advantage of developmentsfrom the project.   In the meantime, witnesses said, the information is caught up inred tape or inertia, too often classified in the United States butavailable abroad or _ just the opposite _ reports on inventions aredisseminated before companies can bid on them.   The subcommittee staff is exploring the effectiveness of theFederal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and previous legislation inencouraging the private use of government-developed technology.   The act, combined with an executive order in 1987, allowsfederal laboratories to enter into cooperative research anddevelopment agreements with the private sector and provides forroyalty sharing by government scientists.   White House adviser D. Allan Bromley said there were 200 suchagreements now.   Critics say the act is too soft in its language, doing toolittle to encourage active leadership. All witnesses said thatleadership was necessary for technology transfer to get anywhere.   The government spends more than $60 billion a year on researchin 700 laboratories, 47 percent of the research and developmentexpenditures in this country, according to the subcommitteeresearch.   From the Army Corps of Engineers, to the Department of Energy toNASA, the National Institutes of Health and the AgricultureDepartment, the government-financed laboratory produces a weath ofmaterials that can be used in medicine, construction andmanufacturing.   However, licensing payments to federal researchers andinstitutions totaled less than $4 million last year, said Rep. RonWyden, D-Ore., chairman of the subcommittee.   Bromley told the subcommittee he was committed to improvingtechnology transfer and, under prodding by Wyden, said histechnology blueprint for the nation, to be released early thisyear, would contain a section on the subject.   He also said he was creating an industrial technology section inhis Office of Science and Technology Policy. He said he hasselected a person for that position and President Bush would beannouncing the appointment.   The office would be in charge of competitiveness issues,including technology transfers, he said.   ``There are some very bright spots in the system,'' he said,``But I certainly agree with you that we have a long way to go.''</TEXT></DOC>
