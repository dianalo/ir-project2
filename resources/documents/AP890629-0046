MILLS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Department of Housing and Urban Developmentgave millions of dollars in aid to apartment projects around thecountry in 1987 and 1988 that did not meet the department'seligibility requirements, according to an auditor's report.   The funds came from a special discretionary fund controlled byThomas Demery, then an assistant HUD secretary, that was intended tohelp financially ailing projects insured by the Federal HousingAdministration, according to the report released Wednesday by Rep.Bill Green, R-N.Y.   Green said the audit of 25 projects that got grants in the 1987and 1988 fiscal years showed found 11 did not meet HUDqualifications and that $30 million to $35 million ``went toundeserving or low-need projects.''   ``That also means more needy projects went without help and someof those ultimately failed, adding to the FHA's insurance costs,''said Green, a former HUD regional housing administrator and theranking Republican on the House Appropriations housing subcommittee.   ``Many of the discretionary funds were made in direct conflictwith existing Office of Housing policies,'' the report concluded,according to today's editions of The New York Times.   ``Documentation was not available to justify why these policieswere not followed for the particular awards,'' the Times quoted thereport as saying. ``Consequently, these awards raise concern as towhether any other factors entered into the decision-making process.''   In some cases, local HUD offices had recommended against awardingfederal assistance to the apartment projects, while in others, thelocal HUD office was bypassed, according to the audit of the Section8 Discretionary Loan Management Set-Aside Program.   In one instance, a Chicago apartment owner received $11 millionfrom HUD even though the apartment building had 100 percentoccupancy, no tenants paying more than 40 percent of their income inrent, and was rated by HUD as being at no financial risk.   The audit covered grants for the 1987 and 1988 fiscal years; thereport was completed March 31, 1989.   The program was designed to avoid failures of troubled housingprojects insured by HUD through the FHA. Failure requires HUD toassume the mortgages.   Under the program, projects with low vacancy rates and-or lowtenant income levels are eligible for subsidies to improve abuilding's cash flow and ability to meet mortgage payments.   Many of the projects receiving awards did not file formalrequests for aid through local HUD offices but went directly toheadquarters, according to the audit.   Demery told the Times that decisions were made only on merit andneed.</TEXT></DOC>
