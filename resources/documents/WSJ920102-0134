The 1992 race still begins here, in wintry Iowa, and theearly contests that follow are still in the familiarlyfrigid, forbidding settings: New Hampshire, Maine and SouthDakota. By the time the snows melt, the contenders, theirhandlers, the reporters and the commentators will have movedon, to the south and west. Often informal, sometimes chaotic,almost always seeming as if it is some bewildering, haphazardprocess, the campaign moves, halts and then recommences witha certain precision.</LP><TEXT>   But for all the speeches, the television ads, the tumult,the rallies, the rhetorical thrusts and the strategiccalculations, the presidential contest is driven by campaignrules -- and some of them have been overhauled since the 1988race.   These rules, seldom understood and frequently ignored,give form to the Democratic campaign and will shape itsresults. &quot;This is a very rules-intensive party,&quot; says ThomasDevine, who is directing the presidential campaign of Sen.Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. &quot;And though some people think youshould watch the campaign message, you win the nominationwhen you understand the rules and you understand thecalendar.&quot;   The rules of the road of the 1992 presidential electionmean that the New Hampshire primary will take on even greaterimportance than before, that the endorsement of party leadersis almost essential to win the Democratic nomination, that acandidate who gets an early lead can wrap up the nominationpromptly -- but that the race might drag on until June orbeyond if no front-runner emerges swiftly.   The rules mean, moreover, that before long the campaignwill take on a frenetic pace. More than any other, this racewill be compressed into the beginning of the course. The timebetween the precinct caucuses here in Iowa and the regularparade of primaries and caucuses that begins in March hasshrunk from 50 days in 1980 and 29 days in 1988 to only 21this year.   That changes the whole dynamic of the campaign. In 1976,Jimmy Carter won the Iowa caucuses and then had several weeksto raise money and build support. These candidates don't havethat luxury.   &quot;These early contests are even more important than beforebecause the early going influences greater numbers ofdelegates,&quot; says Thomas Donilon, a Democratic strategist whowas a campaign aide to former Vice President Walter Mondalein 1984. &quot;And there's less breathing space. More than ever,the most important thing southern voters will know aboutcertain candidates is that they will have won or lost earlierstates.&quot;   The campaign is even more compressed because the firstevent, Iowa's precinct caucuses on Feb. 10, isn't ascompetitive as it has been in the past. With native son TomHarkin in the race, other Democrats have shied away from thecontest; Mr. Harkin, for example, has cornered theendorsement of every Democratic member of both houses of thestate legislature. &quot;Given the time remaining, the shortbudgets and Harkin's presence in the race, the Iowa caucuseshere are vastly different this time,&quot; says former IowaAttorney General Tom Miller, who was Bruce Babbitt's campaignchairman here four years ago. &quot;We're not getting theattention we got in the past and probably won't have theimpact, either.&quot;   So the spotlight returns once again to New Hampshire,which holds its primary eight days after the Iowa caucusesand demands an especially intimate style of campaign.   &quot;This is a small state, and there are strong groups ofpeople -- the elderly, teachers, policemen -- who believe inthe tradition that we are the tryout ground,&quot; says StevenMcAuliff , a Concord, N.H., lawyer who headed Joseph Biden's1988 campaign in the state. &quot;It's a place where people whoaren't nationally known can get a hearing -- but the cost ofthat is that you have to talk to real people and say realthings. If you try to short-cut it, the word gets around thatyou're a `media candidate,' which is the worst reputation youcan have here.&quot;   Beyond New Hampshire, the campaign rhythm will besubstantially different this time. Colorado and Maryland havejumped ahead of the large group of primarily southern &quot;SuperTuesday&quot; states and will hold their primaries March 3; whenthe Georgia legislature reconvenes in two weeks, it may jumpits primary ahead a week as well. Then the following Saturdaycome a number of caucuses and the South Carolina primary,followed on March 10 by Super Tuesday, anchored by primariesin Florida and Texas. And a week after that, Illinois andMichigan, two battleground states in the industrialheartland, hold their primaries on the same day.   These calendar changes can have important implications. Acandidate with an early lead may have the chance to bring thenomination struggle to a virtual close in mid-March, a periodwhen 214 House members also are selected as unpledgeddelegates. The early surge of campaign activity gives acandidate a chance to achieve a critical mass of delegatesand then gain the momentum he needs to attain the necessary2,142 delegates to win nomination.   The unpledged delegates, sometimes known as&quot;superdelegates,&quot; can play an important role in the campaign.There were very few elected officials at the Democrats' 1980convention in New York City, but the number has graduallygrown, reaching 648 in the last campaign and 766 this time.Such officials now comprise about a fifth of the conventionand more than a third of those needed for nomination. &quot;If youdon't get broad support from them,&quot; says Mr. Devine, &quot;you'renot going to win the nomination.   The Democrats also are campaigning under an overhauledsystem of distributing convention delegates. In response todemands the Rev. Jesse Jackson made at the Atlanta conventionfour years ago, the party eliminated winner-take-allprimaries and primaries where the candidate who wins thepopular vote gets an additional delegate bonus. The oldsystem skewed the results: In 1984, Gary Hart won 38% of thevote in the California primary and came away with 204delegates, while Mr. Mondale won 35% but got only 73delegates. That can't happen in 1992.   Mr. Mondale and Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts wonDemocratic nominations using rules that aren't applicabletoday. They concentrated on states that weren't based onproportional representation, primarily Illinois, Ohio and NewYork, where they could build huge delegate margins simply bywinning, even if by a small margin.   &quot;You can't do that this time,&quot; says Anthony Corrado, aColby College political scientist and an authority on partyrules. &quot;All the states are based on proportionalrepresentation.&quot;   The new system, distributing delegates strictly accordingto the votes candidates win, makes for a different sort ofcampaign, though analysts disagree about the implications.Some analysts believe that the new system, fairer by anymeasure, will make it difficult to thwart a candidate with anearly lead. But some also assert that the rule change couldseverely slow the nomination process.   &quot;Proportional representation is tailormade fortroublemakers,&quot; says Elaine Kamarck, director of delegateselection in the Mondale campaign in 1984 and deputy managerof the 1988 Babbitt campaign. &quot;This provision is perfect forlosers who want to muck around in the party. WhileRepublicans let their winners win, we let our losers plaguethe winners.&quot;   But campaigns aren't machines that run of themselves,without human intervention. Democratic National ChairmanRonald Brown has signaled that he won't hesitate to plungeinto the campaign and try to bring it to a crisp conclusionrather than let it dribble on, week after week.   &quot;Since it's clear that we are serious about winning theWhite House and since it's more and more apparent that it'spossible to do it, we should enhance those chances by havinga candidate early,&quot; the chairman says. &quot;That way we can startfocusing all of our attention on George Bush rather thandepleting some of our energy by fighting with each other.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
