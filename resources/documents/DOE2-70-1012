<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-1012 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Equipment Engineering Division of the Savannah River Laboratory hasrecently completed the development of a robotic inspection system foruse in conducting full volumetric examinations of the site's reactortanks. The development of the inspection equipment was necessary to obtainquantitative volumetric data on the structural integrity of the tankssuch that service life could be evaluated. The development program includedthe design and fabrication of four, five-axis robotic inspection tools,six three-axis camera and lighting masts, video equipment, mobile controlcenters, complete mockup and testing facilities, and the integrationof ultrasonic and eddy current data collection equipment. This papergives a brief history of past reactor vessel inspections. The need, justification,and implementation of the development effort is then discussed. The varioussystem components developed including the tools, controls, data acquisitionsystems, etc. are discussed along with the unique design constraintseach had to meet and how each supports the overall inspection system.Implementation of the inspection system in the field and future developmentacres to increase the equipments versatility are also described. 2 refs.,9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
