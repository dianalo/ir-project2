ITOH andamp; CO., MITSUI andamp; CO. and SUMITOMO CORP. are asking the Tokyo government to lend money to Poland so that they can export a plant for the production of small cars in the Eastern European country.    Foreign governments haven't been extending new loans to Poland because of the country's inability to make payments on its $33.5 billion foreign debt.    Daihatsu, which is part of the Toyota Motor Corp. group, and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy are bidding against each other for the project.    Officials of the Japanese companies said they want to export a plant capable of making as many as 120,000 cars annually and to transfer related technology to Poland. A Daihatsu spokesman said the export of the plant alone would be valued at about 40 billion yen ($275 million). </TEXT></DOC>
