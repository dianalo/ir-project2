Mrs. Aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency Dec. 6 andthis week asked Congress to grant specific powers under thedeclaration.   The bill approved Wednesday by the House of Representativeslimits the powers to 90 days. The Senate version could extend themup to six months. The Senate will resume debate on its versionThursday.   Renegade troops surrendered their last stronghold Saturday afterat least 113 people died in the rebellion that began Dec. 1.However, authorities say about half the estimated 3,000 troops whotook part in the coup attempt are still at large.   Both congressional bills would let authorities search forweapons and ammunition in private homes without normal legalconstraints.   But searches and seizures would be ``in the context ofconstitutional guarantees'' under the House version, meaning awarrant would be required, Rep. Edcel Lagman, sponsor of theamendment, said.   Another amendment says measures to put down the rebellion mustbe ``within the protection of the bill of rights.''   The House Rules Committee, dominated by pro-administrationstalwarts, proposed a six-month emergency period and its section onsearches and seizures did not refer to constitutional guarantees orthe bill of rights.   The House voted against letting Mrs. Aquino intervene in labordisputes and suspend labor laws. The Senate version would keep theprovision, which critics regard as a virtual ban on strikes.   Mrs. Aquino said she needed stronger powers to search forweapons and rebels still at large. Business groups asked for curbson strikes to enhance confidence among investors.   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile denounced Mrs. Aquino's emergency decreeas a move toward dictatorship. Former human rights lawyer Sen. ReneSaguisag defended it because of the coup attempt.   Emergency powers also could be used in extending the lease onthe U.S. military bases in the Philippines and approving them wouldhave ``dire implications'' for civil liberties, said Enrile, adefense minister and martial law administrator under PresidentFerdinand Marcos from 1972 to 1981.   Enrile broke with Marcos and joined a popular uprising thatinstalled Mrs. Aquino as president in February 1986 and droveMarcos into exile in Hawaii, where he died. Enrile later joined theopposition to Mrs. Aquino.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Wednesday that rebels whoattempted the coup were still capable of staging terror attacks andassassinations. He said the government will no longer seek U.S. aircover over Philippine territory.   U.S. jets flew ``persuasion flights'' to discourage more bombingruns on the Malacanang presidential palace and the militaryheadquarters by rebel aircraft, turning the tide in favor of thegovernment on the first day of the mutiny.</TEXT></DOC>
