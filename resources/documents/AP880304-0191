Shultz was staying. The guerrilla group said Shultzwas the target.   Police, who defused the bomb safely, said the car had been foundaccidentally after it was abandoned by its driver. There were noreports of arrests.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the bomb was well off the routethe secretary took from the hotel to Israeli government offices.   But Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestinian guerrilla group,Fatah, said in a statement in Beirut that ``the driver had anaccident and the car crashed into a power pole about 30 minutesbefore the time set for the bomb to explode.''   ``The driver deserted the vehicle and managed to escape,'' thecommunique said.   In a communique telephoned to The Associated Press office inwest Beirut, Fatah said its military command ``instructed theLimassol martyrs group to park a bomb-laden car in front of theHilton Hotel in Jerusalem targeting Shultz, the messenger ofimperial'' Yehudai said. ``Laterthe chief police explosives expert passed by and through his ownexperience decided the car was indeed suspicious ... We found itwas a car bomb.''   The car carried Israeli license plates with a sticker reading:``Contribute to security.''   Israel Television quoted police officials as saying the car wassold ``to an Arab who apparently used a fake identity (card).''   The car was found less than a quarter-mile from the hotel, whereShultz spent Thursday night.   Three officials of Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organizationwere killed in a car bomb explosion in the Cypriot port of LimassolFeb. 14.   The PLO blamed Israel's Mossad secret service for the bombing.   It said the attack was meant to be ``a response to the Zionists'brutality against our people in the occupied territories.''   ``We warn Shultz and all agents of imperialism against reachingout for the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of thePalestinian people,'' the communique added.   It was the second report of a car bomb in two days. On Thursday,one exploded outside the bus station of Kfar Saba, a town incentral Israel, causing no injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
