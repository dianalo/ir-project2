Bongard, formerly president of Home State Savings Bank, entered a plea agreement under which he is expected to testify at the federal trial of the bank's former owner, Marvin L. Warner, a federal prosecutor said.    D. Michael Crites, the U.S. attorney here, said that on Monday Mr. Bongard will enter guilty pleas to one federal count of conspiracy and three federal counts of wire fraud in connection with the collapse of Cincinnati-based Home State in March 1985. Mr. Bongard would then face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and $253,000 in fines.    Mr. Bongard had been indicted last year on 16 counts of fraud and conspiracy, which carried a maximum prison term of 90 years.    Mr. Crites said he expects Mr. Bongard to testify at the trial of Mr. Warner, which is to begin May 5 in Ann Arbor, Mich. The trial was moved out of Cincinnati because of pre-trial publicity. Mr. Warner also faces federal fraud and conspiracy charges.    Stephen J. Butler, an attorney for Mr. Bongard, declined to comment.    Prosecutors have alleged that Messrs. Bongard and Warner conspired in fraudulent securities transactions with the now collapsed E.S.M. Government Securities Inc. Messrs. Bongard and Warner also had personal accounts at E.S.M., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla. securities firm.    Messrs. Bongard and Warner have already been convicted on state charges related to the failure of Home State. Mr. Bongard was sentenced to 10 years in state prison and ordered to pay $114 million in restitution. Both men are appealing the verdicts. </TEXT></DOC>
