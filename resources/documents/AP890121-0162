But while observers say they are impressed with the pace andexecution of Texaco's restructuring, they concede the oil giant'sfuture remains uncertain.   Texaco has made major changes over the last year, selling offmajor assets, reorganizing internally and shifting its focus toexploration and production from refining and marketing.   But despite the changes, analysts say Texaco has not been able toformulate a clear, long-term strategy due largely to the cost andenergy that has gone into battling the power plays of a legion ofdissatisfied investors led by its largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn.   Icahn has been pushing Texaco to boost the value of the company'sstock by selling off assets and this week indicated he might try fora second time to wrest control of Texaco's board from management atthe May shareholders meeting. Icahn also has indicated in the pasthe might mount a buyout bid for the oil giant.   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company behind Exxon Corp.and Mobil Corp., announced Friday it had signed a definitiveagreement to sell its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada Inc. toImperial Oil Ltd. of Canada for $34.36 a share, or $3.24 billion.The deal was the final step in the asset-sale portion asset saleportion of a major restructuring.   The Canadian subsidiary fetched far more than had beenanticipated, bringing the total value of Texaco's asset sales underits restructuring program to more than $7 billion.   Texaco has promised to distribute $1.7 billion in proceeds fromthe sales to shareholders, probably in the form of a stock buyback.   Analysts say they don't expect Texaco to boost the amount of theproceeds promised to shareholders, but rather raise the commondividend to enhance shareholder value over the longer term.   Nevertheless, now could be the perfect opportunity to weakenshareholder support for Icahn, especially if Texaco opts for a stockbuyback, some analysts say.   ``I believe Icahn's intention all along has been to sell, not tobuy,'' said Michael Young, an analyst with Smith Barney Harris Uphamandamp; Co.   Friday's sale included Texaco Canada's refining assets but leftintact much of its exploration and production assets in Canada aswell as in West Africa, Brazil and other areas.   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri acknowledged that the company'sfocus has shifted to exploration and production side of the business.   ``That's clearly where Texaco is going,'' Young said. ``But thejury is still out as to whether Texaco will have success in theexploration business.''   In the last two years, U.S. oil production has declined byapproximately 1 million barrels a day due in mainly to a sharp dropin oil prices, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Duringthat time, many major oil companies have shifted their focus to themore profitable refining and marketing side of the industry.   Analysts say Texaco's turn to exploration and production hashappened by default due to its financial troubles.   Texaco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to posta potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond in its fightwith Pennzoil Co.   Pennzoil had sued claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty OilCo. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part of thereserve-rich Getty. In 1985 a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3billion judgment.   Texaco had appealed the judgment but eventually was forced byshareholders to settle with Pennzoil for $3 billion.   Icahn pressured Texaco into a restructuring, mainly through thesale of assets, to boost the company's stock price after thecompany's board rejected his friendly proposal to buy Texaco for $60a share. Last year, Icahn narrowly lost proxy fight for control ofTexaco's board.   Icahn has continued to increase his stake in Texaco and earlierthis week announced he controls 16.6 percent of the company. Icahnalso disclosed he was considering the possibility of waging anothercontest for board seats at the annual shareholders meeting in May.   Nevertheless, analysts said they were impressed with the priceand the terms of the Texaco Canada sale as well as with the pace atwhich Texaco has managed to complete its restructuring.   ``Less than a year since emerging from bankruptcy, Texaco hasbeen able to sell $7 billion in assets and pay down debt by $2.8billion and improve earnings dramatically,'' said Young.   When Texaco first announced last year that Texaco Canada would beput on the auction block, observers speculated the company wouldfetch under $3 billion. In the last several weeks, that estimate hadsoared.   In addition to the asset sales, Texaco has cut back operationsand reorganized management.   Other major asset sales in the last year have included its 99percent interest in the West German subsidiary, Deutsche TexacoA.G., for $1.2 billion. Late last year, it completed the sale of 50percent of its refining and marketing assets in 23 eastern and Gulfof Mexico states to Saudi Arabia for $800 million. Texaco has saidit expects to realize $1.8 billion from that joint venturepartnership with the Saudis.</TEXT></DOC>
