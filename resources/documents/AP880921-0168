(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A second creditor has filed court papersasking that PTL, the television ministry founded by Jim Bakker, beclosed and auctioned off piece by piece.   The accounting firm of Arthur Andersen and Co. wants the U.S.Bankruptcy Court to convert the PTL case to a Chapter 7 fromChapter 11, a court-supervised reorganization.   Under Chapter 7, the Christian theme park and retreat at FortMill would be closed and its assets auctioned.   The television ministry has been in bankruptcy reorganizationsince June 1987, three months after Bakker left amid asex-and-money scandal.   A federal grand jury in Charlotte, N.C., has been looking intoPTL, and Jay Babcock, PTL's former director of creative television,said Tuesday he told the panel he had sex with Bakker.   Babcock said he gave the information to the grand jury afterbeing asked questions apparently designed to determine whetherministry money, much of which comes from tax-deductible donations,was paid for sexual favors.   Babcock is the first man to publicly acknowledge telling thegrand jury of a sexual encounter with Bakker. In August, Bakkerdenied under oath that he had ever had a homosexual relationship.   When he was told that, Babcock responded, ``I'm saying he's aliar.''   Bakker did not return phone calls to his office in Fort Mill,S.C., on Wednesday.   Two other grand jury witnesses, former PTL general manager GarySmith and former ministry board member the Rev. Charles Cookman,also acknowledged that the subject of homosexuality had come upduring their testimony this week.   ``It was a very small, almost insignificant issue because theAssemblies of God has already spoken on that,'' said Cookman,referring to the Pentecostal denomination he serves as NorthCarolina superintendent. ``There is not a lot of question aboutwhere we stand on those matters.''   Bakker was dismissed by the Assemblies of God in May 1987 forunbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounter with JessicaHahn in 1980 and because of ``alleged misconduct involving bisexualactivity.''   After his testimony, Babcock was asked by a reporter, ``What didyou say regarding sex with Jim Bakker?''   His response: ``I commented that `Yes, it happened _ a long timeago.''' He would not elaborate.   In the matter involving creditors, Andersen officials cited thebankruptcy trustee's mid-August report that PTL's operating costshave exceeded revenues by $1.2 million since April 15.   ``The continuing loss and diminution of the estate is occurringand there is no reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation of thedebtor,'' company officials said in court papers.   The first request to put PTL on the auction block came Sept. 7from Fairfax Savings of Baltimore. PTL owes Fairfax $12.2 million.   The court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, has said PTLwould get a better deal if it could stay open while trying to sellits assets.   Benton has had various negotiations since May with prospectivebuyers, including Bakker. Bakker's $172 million offer fell apartSept. 10 when he failed to come up with a down payment.   After Benton said Bakker was out of the running, Canadian realestate executive Peter Thomas reinstated his bid, which he hadbacked earlier with a $1 million deposit.   ``We are actively pursuing reaching an agreement this week,''said Bob Ransford, spokesman for Thomas, whose company has offered$113 million for PTL.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds has told Benton torecommend a buyer by Tuesday. Benton said he has offers from twoother unidentified groups.   Among PTL's assets are the 504-room Heritage Grand Hotel, athree-acre water park, and a studio and satellite network.</TEXT></DOC>
