The issue is the first in a $14 billion U.S. military-loan refinancing program for foreign countries.    The Israeli offering, repackaged from U.S. loans outstanding, consists of $4.82 billion face amount of government trust certificates whose principal and interest payments are 100% guaranteed by the U.S. Underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said they expect to price the offering this week.    Since Congress approved legislation authorizing the refinancing of high-cost loans on U.S. military sales to foreign governments late last year, the Defense Department has identified about $14 billion of such loans eligible to be repackaged as debt securities. Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia and Turkey are among the countries expected to issue U.S. debt offerings under the program.    Pakistan expects to sell $600 million, for instance, while Turkey and Tunisia have lined up $750 million and $196 million, respectively. According to a preliminary prospectus for the Israeli offering, Israel has a total of $5.4 billion principal amount of such loans eligible for refinancing.    The refinancings appeal to both these debtor nations and the U.S. Israel, for instance, will be able to lower the cost of its U.S. interest rate payments. Since 1975, interest rates on the loans ranged from 7 1/4% to 17%, according to the underwriters. Israel's interest cost on the debt will be at most 10%. In return for a lower interest rate, Israel will buy enough U.S. government securities to reduce the U.S. liability on the repackaged loans to Israel by 10%.    The foreign loan refinancings resemble dozens of programs by U.S. agencies and corporations that have repackaged debt outstanding, including mortgages, car and boat loans, and sold them in the form of securities.    The repackaged loans are part of the U.S. government's foreign assistance program that lends money at market rates to key allies so they may purchase U.S. military equipment. It is known as the Foreign Military Sales program.    Shearson Lehman said the four-part Israeli offering will result in proceeds of about $2.5 billion and will be sold in the following form:   --$108.6 million of certificates maturing in 6.63 years, with an average life of 5.4 years. The yield on the securities is expected to be between 0.30 percentage point and 0.35 percentage point more than the yield on the government's five-year note.    --$100 million of certificates maturing in 7.63 years with an average life of 7.2 years. The yield on the certificates is expected to be priced 0.39 to 0.44 percentage point above the rate of the Treasury's seven-year note.    --$1 billion of certificates maturing in 14.13 years with an average life of 10.7 years. The securities are expected to be priced 0.42 percentage point to 0.47 percentage point above the rate of the Treasury's 10-year note.    --$3.61 billion of certificates maturing in 0.13 to 25.13 years with an average life of 0.13 to 25.13 years. These securities are expected to be priced 0.25 to 0.28 percentage point above the yields on so-called stripped, zero-coupon Treasury bonds. Proceeds from this portion of the offering will total about $1.33 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
