The study _ ``Unequal Picture: Black, Hispanic, Asian and NativeAmerican Characters on Television'' _ was released by WiderOpportunities for Women, a non-profit group working to promoteequality in the workplace.   Among its major findings:   _Nine of 10 minority characters are middle class or wealthy where``in reality more than 40 percent of minority men and 60 percent ofminority women have incomes below $10,000 a year.''   _``Most programs reduce injustice to individual conflict, denyingthe reality of oppressive social structures, except for a very fewshows which present a multicultural world.''   _Only situation comedies provide minority female characters asleading roles. ``Almost three-quarters of all minority females ontelevision are featured in comedies.''   _Workplaces are portrayed as ``egalitarian ... with no hint ofbias, even though whites are almost always in charge.''   The study examined more than 150 episodes of 30 networktelevision series featuring minorities in recurring roles.   Of the 78 minority characters on prime time TV, the study foundthat the overwhelming majority, 65 _ or 83 percent _ were blacks.Blacks account for about 55 percent of the nation's minoritypopulation, according to Census Bureau data.   Hispanics accounted for only 12 percent of the minoritycharacters on TV while they compose about 35 percent of the minoritypopulation. Asians, about 6 percent of the minority population,constituted about 4 percent of the minority characters on TV.   Native Americans _ Indians _ constituted only 1 percent of theminority characters protrayed on in TV. In reality, native Americansmake up about 2 percent of the minority population.   Of the 162 producers working on the 30 shows, only 12 wereblacks, Hispanics, Asians or Native Americans, the study said. Andof the 12 minority producers, only four were women.   ``No wonder TV's integrated world is such a happy one,'' saidSteenland. ``No wonder minority characters are nearly identical totheir white buddies. White producers and writers are creatingcharacters in their own image.''   The study said the ``token status'' of minority producers andwriters in television can be overcome only through more aggressiverecruiting, hiring and promotion.</TEXT></DOC>
