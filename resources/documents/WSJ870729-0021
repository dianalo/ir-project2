But it's difficult to tell whether their enthusiasm stems from the health care products company's proposed merger with A.H. Robins or from renewed takeover speculation about Rorer itself.    After Rorer signed a letter of intent July 3 to merge with Robins, also a health care and consumer products concern, its stock fell a point to 45 1/8 but rebounded quickly. Rorer closed yesterday at 51 7/8, and some analysts interpret its gain as a Wall Street endorsement of the transaction.    &quot;People are beginning to understand what the (merger's) impact could be,&quot; Hemant Shah of Nomura Securities says. He forecasts that the combined Rorer-Robins would earn $5 a share by 1989. Rorer made 16 cents a share on operations in 1986, and Robins had net income of $3.38 a share.    But others see a different story emerging. &quot;I don't think the market is giving us its seal of approval on the Robins merger,&quot; Rita Freeman of PNC Financial Corp. says. &quot;I suspect there's someone in there with other intentions.&quot;    The proposed merger of Rorer and Robins has revived talk about other possible drug-company combinations. Many analysts say drug makers will begin acquiring competitors to get promising new compounds without spending huge amounts on product development. Furthermore, generally healthy earnings make drug firms attractive targets for companies in other industries.    The relative inactivity of Robins's stock also provides grist for the rumor mill. For about a month, Robins has languished at around 27 1/2. That's where it closed yesterday, up 1/4.    Analysts say the tax-free stock payout that Robins holders will receive if the merger is approved should have generated more investor interest in the shares.    Samuel D. Isaly, an analyst with S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., says the climb of more than five points in Rorer's share price alongside the apparent lack of interest in Robins's stock indicate that investors think Rorer may well be bought by someone other than Robins.    Among those rumored to be interested in Rorer are Beecham Group, Pfizer, Unilever, Upjohn and Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group. But little hard evidence has surfaced so far to support such speculation.    An Upjohn spokeswoman said she isn't aware of any corporate interest in Rorer. Pfizer and Unilever declined to comment. Officials at Beecham's U.S. operations referred calls to the company's London headquarters, where officials couldn't be reached for comment. At Revlon, Mr. Perelman didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    Mr. Perelman sold two prescription-drug businesses to Rorer in 1985 to finance his $1.83 billion takeover of Revlon. Sources close to the Revlon chairman dismiss the Rorer rumors and say he isn't interested in owning a prescription-drug maker.    Robert Bitterman, Rorer's investor relations director, says he's &quot;99.44% sure that there's no accumulation (of Rorer shares) taking place.&quot; Rorer, an oft-rumored takeover target, added a poison-pill provision to its bylaws in 1985 that would dilute the stock of any company that tried to launch a hostile tender offer. Sources close to Robert Cawthorn, Rorer's chairman, say he remains uninterested in selling the company.    On its face, a Rorer-Robins merger looks expensive and dilutive for Rorer holders. Rorer is offering to shell out $2.6 billion to settle Robins's Chapter 11 liabilities, including about 218,000 Dalkon Shield claims pending against it. The proposal also includes a $725 million swap of Rorer common or preferred for each of the 24.2 million Robins common shares outstanding. The companies must agree on terms by Friday.    Mr. Bitterman says Rorer would expect some earnings dilution during the first year of the combination. If the merger is approved, he says, Rorer's earnings and cash flow by 1989 will be better than they would be without the combination.    In addition, Rorer says it would receive more than $600 million in tax breaks from a $1.75 billion Dalkon Shield trust fund it would establish for Robins. The fund would pay the claims of women who say the contraceptive device that Robins once sold caused uterine perforations, sterility and other injuries.    Despite the price, Mr. Shah of Nomura says, &quot;it's quite possible that Rorer wouldn't have to borrow one penny&quot; to finance the merger. He figures that the money to begin funding the trust could come from the companies' own cash supplies, which total about $400 million. The rest would be paid over time from future earnings and cash flow, he says.    Even analysts who are skeptical about other facets of the proposal see certain advantages.    David Saks, a drug analyst with L.F. Rothschild, says the merger would let Rorer add compatible, profitable businesses at an appealing price.    &quot;But with all those claimants and lawyers involved in the approval process,&quot; he says, &quot;one can't be sure that this merger will go through.&quot;    Warburg's Mr. Isaly says the outlook for the combined company would be promising. But he rates Rorer stock only a &quot;hold,&quot; saying Robins doesn't offer the product-development muscle Rorer will need.    Nevertheless, many investors appear to agree with Linda Newman, a money manager who holds a small position in Rorer. Ms. Newman figures Rorer's stock will slip only about four points, to 48, if the Robins merger fizzles. With such a modest risk, she says, &quot;It's hard to be bearish.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
