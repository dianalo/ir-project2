The rise in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities was especially strong in consumer goods, defense equipment and nondurable items, those intended to last less than three years, the Fed said. It followed an increase of 0.6% for November and a revised 0.3% rise in October. The October gain was previously reported as 0.1%.    The Fed also said that the operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point to 79.6% of capacity in December but remained below the year-earlier level.    &quot;It was a pretty broad-based increase&quot; in industrial production, said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago. &quot;It shows a certain amount of optimism on the part of producers.&quot;    Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;On the whole, it's an encouraging report. Some parts of manufacturing, particularly those with export sensitivity, seem to be picking up.&quot;    He said these companies have benefited from the decline in the dollar against major currencies in foreign-exchange trading over the past two years. A lower dollar makes exports more competitive overseas and imports more expensive. So far, however, the shift in exchange rates has apparently failed to narrow the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which swelled to a record $19.22 billion in November.    Moreover, these economists and others suggested that some of the apparent strength in production may reflect temporary factors, such as a push by consumers to make major purchases before the sales-tax deduction was repealed at year-end and by businesses to complete projects before depreciation changes occurred. As a result, many analysts contend that the economy's growth may be slowing in the current period.    &quot;The question is what the first quarter will look like,&quot; said Mr. Kahan. Mr. Chimerine agreed, saying, &quot;I wouldn't say a major acceleration in the economy is under way.&quot;    Output by manufacturers increased 0.6% in December after a 0.5% gain in November, with durables up 0.7% after a 0.4% rise. Nondurables climbed 0.5% after rising 0.6%. Mining production, which includes the troubled oil and gas extraction industry, rose 0.4% after a 0.7% gain. Output of utilities fell 0.2% after a 1.2% rise.    Materials output rose 0.2% after a 1% gain.    Factory output for December was up 2.4% from a year earlier. Mining output, however, was down 9.7%, with utilities down 3.7% and materials production down 0.6%.    The Fed's industrial production index stood at 126.6% of its 1977 average in December, up 0.9% from a year earlier.    In the operating rate report, the Fed said that the December rate compared with revised rates of 79.4% in November and 79.1% in October. The Fed previously reported rates of 79.3% in November and 79% in October.    The latest rate, however, was below the 80.6% of December 1985.    The pace for factories increased to 80.3% in December from 79.9% the month before, as the rate for the motor vehicle and parts industry rose to 79.7% from 77.1%. Overall, durable-goods producers operated at 76.9% of capacity, up from 76.5% in November, while nondurable-goods makers used 85.2% of capacity, up from 85%.    The operating rate in the mining industry increased to 73.7% of capacity from 73.4% in November and 72.8% in October as coal production surged and oil and gas well drilling stabilized, the Fed said. These increases were the first since last January. For utilities, the rate fell to 80% from 80.3% in November. Materials industries used 78.6% of capacity last month, up from 78.5% in November.    All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in December.
