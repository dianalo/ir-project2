(Programming on Purpose column) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Plauger, P. J.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Software that fails to capture and hold customers' interest can becalled 'shelfware,' since, essentially, it will stay on the shelfunused.andP;  These types of software can fall into several categories.andO;'Orphan' software products are ones that have lost support.andP;  Thiscan be because the product is too outdated for enhancements or thevendor moves too slowly in upgrading.andP;  'Nest of vipers' softwarehas suffered from too many quick fixes from an overabundance ofsupport that results in customers not having the same product.andO;'Chatterbox' products are products that ask users too manyquestions such as 'are you sure?' or require users to constantlypress OK buttons.andP;  Products should have the capability of userautomation and have a 'trust me' override.andP;  'Fortress' productsare those that ask for too much information from users as proofthat they have not pirated the product.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software QualitySoftware DesignVendor RelationsCritique.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>It is probably the dirtiest open secret in the software business.andP;  I'm nottalking about schedule slippages or cost overruns.andP;  I'm not talking aboutexcessive bug levels.andP;  Nasty as they are, those things can be overcome intime.andM;Software can suffer a worse fate than taking too long, costing too much, oreven being too hard to debug.andP;  It can fail to capture and hold your interestafter you buy it.andP;  When that happens, you purge the software from your disks.andO;You remove its diskettes from the handy carrier and its manuals from the backcorner of your desk.andM;If you're really annoyed at the software, you dump all traces of it in atrash can.andP;  More likely, you retain some painful memory of what you paid forit.andP;  So you feel obliged to retain some hope of resurrecting it in thefuture.andP;  You pack the diskettes and manuals into a cohesive lump and stowthem somewhere not too handy, probably on a top shelf just out of reach.andM;Once a product makes this transition, it is no longer software.andP;  It hasacquired, in recent years, a more derogatory name: &quot;shelfware.&quot;andM;No self-respecting programmer sets out to write shelfware.andP;  We all havehigher ambitions than that.andP;  We want to make products that change people'slives for the better.andP;  We want to write software that people will use everyday and recommend to their friends.andP;  We want to acquire a following thateagerly awaits each new release we contrive.andM;Even if your ambitions are purely mercenary, shelfware is bad business.andO;Computer software is more than one-shot publishing, like a book or an audiorecording.andP;  It requires ongoing maintenance and enhancement.andP;  Put anotherway, it gives you, the software vendor, numerous opportunities to sell backto your client base.andP;  You can sell maintenance if the product is sufficientlycomplex.andP;  You can sell new releases of any software not dipped in epoxy.andM;A marketing person will tell you that selling to happy customers is about theeasiest sell you can enjoy.andP;  That helps make it one of the most profitablesells as well.andP;  And that pays the rent and orthodontist bills year afteryear.andP;  Unless you are in the business of going out of business, like theinfamous shops on Times Square, that's the kind of business you want tobuild.andM;I confess to having written my share of shelfware.andP;  Some of it found its wayto the top shelf by a reasonably honest path: it got old.andP;  Perhaps I could nolonger justify supporting and enhancing it for my few remaining customers.andO;Or perhaps I sold the rights to it and the new owners chose to remainder it.andO;That sort of thing happens a lot in our rapidly evolving field.andM;Other software I wrote became shelfware for less defensible reasons.andP;  Irefused to listen to customers and make the changes they needed.andP;  Or Iguessed wrong about which customer feedback to respond to.andP;  Sometimes Isimply got blown away by the competition because I didn't work hard enough tokeep up.andM;At the time, I found it hard to see the causes for my own shelfware.andP;  When Istarted acquiring commercial software in serious quantities, I wised up.andP;  Icould see other people's failures much more clearly than my own.andP;  Funny howthat works.andM;To help you see some of the origins of shelfware, I have tried tocharacterize some of the principal causes in the following caricatures.andP;  Eachemphasizes some shortcoming that can push a product over the line (or, moreaptly, onto the top shelf).andP;  True shelfware often suffers from a combinationof shortcomings.andP;  But let's keep it simple.andM;The &quot;orphan&quot; is a product that has lost its support.andP;  It may have been amainstay two years ago, but it hasn't seen an upgrade since.andP;  Meanwhile, theproducts with which it works have been improved.andP;  The orphan knows nothingabout the new file formats, so it keeps crashing.andM;You call the service hot line.andP;  If it hasn't been disconnected, you get asupport person who's not really sure about the behavior of such an oldproduct.andP;  No patches are available.andP;  Questions about new releases are metwith embarrassed evasions.andM;Soon you figure out that the once-wonderful product is trapped in a timewarp.andP;  If you want to stick with it, you'll have to discard anything newerthan your Sinead O'Connor CDs.andP;  Otherwise, you'd better kiss it Loodnight andshelve it.andM;I've already cited some reasons why a product gets orphaned.andP;  You can'texpect a company to keep enhancing your CP/M word processor, and you can'tbring a company back from the dead if it goes out of business.andP;  But you cangripe if a company simply moves too slowly or puts its energies into productsless important to you.andP;  That's when you vote with your feet by climbing on achair to reach the top shelf.andM;The &quot;nest of vipers&quot; is worse than the orphan.andP;  It sops up all your gumptionas you try to get it to work the way you want.andP;  Every time you think you haveit under control, it finds a new place to bite.andM;The problem is not lack of support.andP;  Every time you call the hot line-evenafter eight p.m.--techies are there to lend you a hand.andP;  Typically, they arethe folks who actually developed the product.andP;  They are always willing tohelp you try one more patch or another clever workaround.andP;  You can avoidbuying diskettes for a year just by recycling the quick fixes they ship you.andM;As you might guess, this freewheeling approach to software caused the problemin the first place.andP;  I know of one no longer major software company that tookpride in the continuing program of product enhancement conducted by severalof the techie principals.andP;  Every shipment embodied the latest version of theproduct.andP;  Often it was only one day old.andM;After two years of booming along, the company found itself completely miredin supporting existing customers.andP;  Some of the company's customers tried tohelp each other, until they found that no two had the same product.andP;  Up tothe very end, though, the company happily provided patches.andM;The customers left because they couldn't afford all that assistance.andP;  Whatthey needed was a product with fewer bugs.andP;  Barring that, they at leastneeded a product with better version control.andP;  No amount of first aid willsave you from repeated injections of venom.andM;The &quot;amnesiac&quot; doesn't poison you so much as it annoys you to death.andP;  Youmight have a product that does just what you want.andP;  It has all the parametersyou could possibly imagine, so you can tailor its behavior to perfection.andO;There is only one small problem: it flatly refuses to remember any of yourdetailed conversations from run to run.andP;  You have to renegotiate the desiredbehavior every time you want to use the product.andM;If you're lucky, you can wrap such forgetful critters in a cocoon.andP;  Commandscripts are great for capturing invocation lines that contain a dozen-oddunmemorable parameters.andP;  However, that's where the trend toward menu-driveninterfaces does you in.andP;  Not all of them provide keystroke alternatives topointing and clicking with a mouse.andP;  I have yet to see a really good systemfor capturing mouse movements in a script.andM;The writing analyzer I favor is barely usable, at least to me.andP;  I spent a dayjiggering search paths, tailoring command scripts, and configuring whatever Icould.andP;  That got me to the &quot;doit-file' style of invocation, with just anoccasional gratuitous return to reassure an asinine query.andM;I am now trying to convert completely to Windows 3.0.andP;  To say that I am backto square one with this product is treating it with too much kindness.andP;  Itsprincipal competitor now comes in a special Windows version.andP;  Howeverreluctantly, I am tempted to turn an old standby into shelfware.andM;The &quot;chatterbox&quot; shares many of the same problems with the amnesiac.andP;  It is aproduct of the &quot;don't be scared' school of user-interface design.andP;  No matterhow adept you get with this product, it refuses to wise up.andP;  That sucker isgoing to talk to you and ask you questions long after the cows come home.andM;I am all in favor of an occasional Are you sure? The less I use a product,the greater my chance of saying something rash.andP;  It's nice when a productdouble-checks with you before it obliterates half the banjo players inCleveland.andM;Still, every such checkpoint should come with a Trust me override.andP;  I'll useit at my peril, but please let me use it.andP;  I certainly need it to writescripts that run unattended.andP;  I want it whenever 1 get tired of clicking O.K.andO;buttons.andP;  (If you want to be puckish, how about an occasional Were you sure?andO;once it's too late to undo the damage.)andM;Brian Kernighan and I preached the gospel of software tools for many a year.andO;Our basic sermon was that programs should not be designed differently forautomatic and interactive operation.andP;  You should be able to automate anyinteraction.andP;  You should be able to interactively debug any automation.andP;  Thatcalls for I/O that is clear and to the point.andM;I fear that the industry has lost sight of this laudable design principlewith its new-found love of user-friendly software.andP;  I simply don't want tointeract with much of the software I use.andP;  I want to tell it what to do, goget a cup of coffee, and digest the output when I get back.andP;  If it insists onchatting, it can talk to the packages beside it on the top shelf.andM;The &quot;fortress&quot; is more worried that you will steal it than that you will putit to good use.andP;  You invoke it and it paws at drive A for a key diskette.andP;  Nodiskee, no washee.andP;  Or it asks you to prove you're the rightful owner byentering esoteric information from some document that makes copy machinescough.andP;  I always feel like I'm renewing a loyalty oath when I reassure one ofthese paranoid products.andM;I am all in favor of people getting paid for fair use of software.andP;  Illicitcopying was a concern when I owned my own software company.andP;  Abuse ofintellectual property is an ongoing concern to all of us who earn a livingcapturing ideas in words and bytes.andM;I am also all in favor of customers getting fair value for their money.andO;Treat customers like potential felons and you lose their sympathy.andP;  Put toomany impediments in their way and you lose them as customers.andP;  You canprotect a product so well that it ceases to be a product.andM;I like to think our industry has grown up over the past few years.andP;  Don't askme to show you figures--it's just a feeling.andP;  No longer is the UndergroundComputer Club of Dubuque the principal source of (illicit) software for thatfair city.andP;  Sources of reasonably priced software abound.andP;  No longer canemployees plead ignorance if a niggardly manager buys one package forsimultaneous use on 20 machines.andM;I personally can't afford either the time or the inconvenience of traffickingin pirated software.andP;  For good software, the vendor has me on documentation,support, and upgrades.andP;  For mediocre software, the vendor doesn't hold myattention long anyway.andP;  I suspect much of the market is more like me thannot.andM;I railed about one fortress package in these pages last year.andP;  (&quot;The SevenWarning Signs,&quot; Oct. 1989.) It was a communications package that refused torun on more than one machine.andP;  You're supposed to buy a separate copy foreach end of the communications link.andM;I wasn't about to do that until I was sure the package did what I wanted.andO;Every attempt I made to install the same package on two communicatingmachines was cleverly foiled.andP;  The package was great at protecting itself,but lousy at winning hearts and minds.andP;  It quickly ended up on the shelf,replaced by a package that encouraged installation on multiple machines.andM;More recently, I became addicted to a program that plays bridge.andP;  (Yes, Iknow this is not &quot;programming on purpose,&quot; but I procrastinate occasionallyjust like the rest of you.) I found it perfect for sharpening my game andidling away an unproductive mood.andM;Only problem is, it comes on two diskettes, one of which is a key diskette.andO;To make it usable, you have to copy the contents of both diskettes onto ahard disk.andP;  To actually use it, you have to have the key diskette in drive Awhen you start the program.andM;That means I have to tie up disk space, yet remain anchored to the diskettedrive to use the program.andP;  Worse, the diskettes are available only in 51/4-inch format.andP;  My laptop has such a drive that I hook up to when at home.andO;On the road, I have to leave it behind.andM;What I really want is a single 3 1/2-inch diskette that holds all the filesfor the bridge program.andP;  I can make one, but it won't work because the vendoris certain I'm trying to steal an extra copy.andP;  I'm even willing to buy asecond copy for the road, but the vendor chooses not to sell one in the formI need.andM;I can no longer afford to devote hard disk space to this minor indulgence, soit has recently gone on the shelf.andP;  It's one thing to shelve packages relatedto work.andP;  But when I'm reduced to shelving procrastinationware, you know I'mannoyed.andM;The &quot;disk hog&quot; believes you can't get enough of a good thing.andP;  It comes on 15diskettes, all of which you have to copy onto your hard disk.andP;  But that's notthe end of it.andP;  Some of those files are compressed.andP;  They puff up likepopcorn on their way into your system.andP;  Next thing you know, you've givenaway megabytes of precious magnetic real estate.andP;  I won't even discussapplications that generate 3MB temporary files with little or no warning.andM;The disk-hog designers forget that you have other uses for your systembesides running their package.andP;  They figure you'll really appreciate all theextra whistles and bells they thought up while developing their pride andjoy.andP;  They cheerfully lade on examples, tutorials, help files, and cutelittle utilities that you might use some day.andM;I think all those things are great, mind you.andP;  Put each group of relatedfiles on a separate diskette.andP;  Provide a separate guide and installationprocedure for each.andP;  Where possible, show the customer how to use the extrasright off the diskette.andP;  At the very least, you want to be able to pick andchoose the parts you want to keep.andM;What generally happens is quite the opposite.andP;  The installation process pumpseverything you could possibly need onto the hard disk.andP;  Files have suchcryptic names, and little or no documentation, that you don't know which areused for what.andP;  I have paralyzed a large software package more than oncetrying to trim its diet for disk space.andP;  Chuck the wrong file and you getfruity behavior.andP;  Seldom is the package smart enough to say, &quot;Hey, whathappened to C:\GOOBER\ PEANUTSHL?&quot;andM;When I acquired my battery-operated laptop with a 40MB disk, I thought I wasset for years to come.andP;  After all, didn't I produce hundreds of thousands oflines of commercial software on a machine with a tenth as much storage? Yeah,I sprawl a bit more with advancing age, but not all that much.andP;  I thought Iwas in pig heaven.andM;Then a few disk hogs elbowed me aside.andP;  It never occurred to me that atypical PC application eats half a megabyte or more of disk space.andP;  The bigones demand five to 10 times as much space.andP;  It wasn't long before I foundmyself purging the disk on a weekly basis to avoid those nasty &quot;disk full&quot;messages.andP;  Have you noticed that they usually occur half an hour into a majorproject that cannot be resumed?andM;I soon learned that the quickest way to liberate disk space was to remove thelargest packages I could live without.andP;  Being a disk hog is the best way torise to the top of my hit list.andP;  It's worth reinforcing that top shelf totake the weight of the package.andP;  Vendors, take note.andM;The &quot;way of life&quot; is my last target.andP;  I apply this term to a broad spectrumof packages whose common denominator is denial.andP;  They want you to forget youare running in your environment of choice and heartily embrace the one theyprovide.andP;  They want you to do things The One Right Way.andM;I have seen C made to look like ALGOL 68, DOS made to look like UNIX, UNIXmade to look like VMS, and VMS made to look like UNIX.andP;  Each was a tour deforce, in its own way.andP;  But each was also a perversion.andP;  You can nevercompletely turn a silk purse into a sow's ear, or vice versa.andM;One problem in dealing with a way-of-life package is that it tends to snubits neighbors.andP;  If you don't match the protocols and file formats of theinterloper, you can't talk to it.andP;  That makes it hard to combine packages toget a job done.andP;  In this day and age, that makes it hard to solve a problemcost-effectively.andM;Another problem follows directly from this inevitable isolation.andP;  The cost ofbuying into a renegade package is necessarily high.andP;  You have to be willingto invest in special versions of many tools and applications.andP;  You also haveto be willing to turn your back on a larger marketplace and shop inspecialized boutiques.andP;  Or you have to learn to build for yourself what youcannot buy.andM;My company had pretty good success selling compilers, but we never did aswell selling operating systems.andP;  I finally figured out why.andP;  Almost anyengineer can get permission to buy a compiler and tuck it in some corner ofthe development system.andP;  People can use it or not as they see fit.andP;  Theyoften contrive some way to mix and match code from different compilers andassemblers.andM;You don't just buy an operating system and tuck it in a corner, however.andO;Such creatures tend to take over the whole machine, defining the set ofapplications the machine can run.andP;  That is a commitment with far-reachingconsequences.andP;  You don't just buy an operating system; you get married to it.andO;It becomes a way of life.andM;We even tried packaging our operating system in a less intrusive manner.andP;  Wemade it run as a guest under several popular systems.andP;  That made it easierfor a single engineer to tinker with it, and it stayed out of people's way.andO;But it still suffered from a dearth of applications written for it.andP;  Youwrote your own or did without.andM;I still trip across DOS packages that endeavor to impose a unique way of lifeon the DOS environment.andP;  I use them where I must, but less and less.andP;  It'snot that I love DOS - far from it.andP;  I've simply learned the necessity ofhaving a homogeneous environment where diverse products work together.andP;  Thosethat don't work together end up sharing the top shelf of my bookcase.andM;That's my menagerie.andP;  I'm sure you have your own beasties that belong in thiszoo.andP;  We can all feel sorry for software that lacks staying power.andP;  But weshould also endeavor to learn from such failures.andP;  I don't want to make anymore shelfware, and I certainly don't want to buy any more.andP;  My top shelf isalmost full.andP;  nandM;P.J.andP;  Plauger has been a writer of textbooks, a prolific programmer, ad asoftware entrepreneur.andP;  He has been active in the development of standards,most notably for the C programming language.andP;  His most recent book isStandard C, coauthored by Jim Brodie.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
