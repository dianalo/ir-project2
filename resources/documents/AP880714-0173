Troops also set up roadblocks and surrounded key cities in thenorthern Nimba County, according to travelers from the region. Thepre-dawn coup attempt was said to have occurred in the county, 350miles north of Monrovia.   President Samuel K. Doe described the attempted coup in a speechto an emergency session of the National Legislature Wednesday nightthat wasbroadcast live by state radio. A news release issuedThursday by the president's mansion elaborated on the announcement.   Liberian Minister of Information Emmanuel Bower said theattackers tried to cross the border from the neighboring IvoryCoast at Sanniquellie, 450 miles northeast of Monrovia.   The presidential statement said Doe's forces killed and capturedan unspecified number of attackers and prevented 11 others fromcrossing the border.   Doe, 36, assured ``all Liberians and foreigners alike'' that hisgovernment was in ``complete control of the situation and there isno need to panic.''   He said the invaders were led by J. Nicholas Podier Jr.,described as the vice head-of-state of the former governingPeople's Redemption Council.   Doe did not say whether Podier was among those killed. But theJoint Security Force, which is investigating the coup attempt, saidPodier was killed in the battle and said that his body would beshown later on state television.   Doe said the attackers captured in the coup attempt were beingbrought to the capital of Monrovia for ``further investigation.''   Life in Monrovia proceeded as normal Thursday, although somesoldiers were spotted in the city.   Podier was among 17 enlisted men and non-commissioned officersled by then-Master Sgt. Doe who seized control of the West Africannation in an April 12, 1980 coup. They stormed the executivemansion in Monrovia and assassinated President William R. Tolbert.   Doe and his confederates then set up the People's RedemptionCouncil, which ruled by decree until 1985 elections returnedLiberia to civilian rule with Doe as president.   Podier fell from power in 1984 after being accused of plottingagainst Doe. Podier went to live in the Ivory Coast in 1986.   A December 1985 coup attempt led by former People's RedemptionCouncil member Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiqonkpa brought heavy fightinginto the capital until it was crushed by government forces.Quiqonkpa claimed to have seized power and held the state-runLiberia Broadcasting System radio for several hours before beingoverpowered. He later was executed.   On March 22, police arrested 12 people connected with an allegedplot to assassinate Doe and overthrow his government. They havebeen charged with treason and are scheduled to go on trial inAugust.</TEXT></DOC>
