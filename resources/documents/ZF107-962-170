it'savailable now in a 50MHz pixel rate version but the company did not giveprices.andM;- o -andM;Landover, Maryland-based Falcon Microsystems Inc, which markets AppleComputer Inc Macintoshes to the US Federal government, reckons (probablyrightly) that Uncle Sam is about to discover a deepfelt need for RISC-basedUnix file servers, and has acquired rights to market MIPS Computer SystemsInc's servers to the government: Falcon will add MIPS' RC3240 to the GeneralServices Administration's Schedule C, the official purchasing catalogue forpersonal computing products, and will add MIPS products as an integral partof its systems integration activities; &quot;leading&quot; is a term bandied about byUS companies with an abandon that invites deep scepticism - companies filingfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection still style themselves as the leaders intheir field, but when Falcon calls itself the leading supplier ofMacintosh-based integrated systems to the US government, it may be justified- it claims to be Apple's third-largest customer, and to have sold about 90%of all Macs used by Uncle Sam; privately-held Falcon looks for $125m sales inthe year to April.andM;- o -andM;Firefox Communications Ltd, headquartered in Reading, Berkshire is todistribute HyperAccess/5, an asynchronous communications package for OS/2,MS-DOS, and ISDN communications: it provides several term-inal emulationsincluding VT100, VT220, VT320, Televideo 920 and 925, IBM 3101, and ANSIemulation; HyperAccess/5 has script language for customisation and automationwith 150 commands including string manipulation, Boolean logic, and thefacilities to build customised pop-up menus and command boxes; the packagewas designed by the US company, Hilgraeve, and costs #175.andM;- o -andM;Philips NV has commissioned Software Toolworks Inc, Chatsworth, California todevelop user-friendly front-ends and operating system extensions for theMS-DOS personal computers built by North American Philips' HeadStartTechnologies Co.andM;- o -andM;US Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has signed a joint communique ontelecommunications with Marek Kucharski, Polish minister without portfolioand advanced an agreement aimed at improving the investment and businessclimate for US companies in Poland: the communique calls for a strongtelecommunications network in Poland as an &quot;essential ingredient for aviable, growing national economy,&quot; and development of the telecommunicationspackage will begin after the current presidential mission, with the eventualobjective of a Memorandum of Understanding early next year.andM;- o -andM;The European Software Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunnyvale,California-based Boole andamp; Babbage Inc, says it has a new IBM SystemsApplication Architecture-compliant software system that automates systemsmanagement on 370-type mainframes: Mainview automates the operationalprocedures that use processors, input-output devices and subsystems; itcommunicates with MVS, CICS, IMS, DB2, and the disk subsystem, andfacilitates multi-directional dialogue or network alerts; the single-terminaluser is directed towards potential problems after the system has done abackground analysis; a combination of managers and expert systems-basedadvisors identify and correct resource and workload problems.andM;- o -andM;The LDX Group Inc unit of Kansas City, Missouri-based Kansas City SouthernIndustries Inc has completed the sale of its 16% stake in WilliamsTelecommunications Group to Williams Cos, Tulsa, Oklahoma for $100m cash: LDXacquired the stake in connection with the sale of a unit to Williams Cos, thefirm that puts fibre down old pipelines.andM;- o -andM;Bedford, Massachusetts-based Interbase Software Corp has released version 3.0of its eponymous relational database, incorporating distributed processingcapabilities, for hardware running HP-UX, VMS or Ultrix, as well as on Sunworkstations: new features include event alerters, blob filters, arraysupport and user defined functions - prices go from $5,000 to $100,000depending on configuration; five year old Interbase, part-owned byAshton-Tate Corp, reckons to have around 2,300 licences worldwide.andM;- o -andM;Information Presentation Technologies Inc, the Calabasas, California companyin which Sony Corp has just taken a 20% stake (CI No 1,300) has begunshipment of PSN, which it claims is the only Macintosh-to-Macintoshdistributed server networking software to provide full compliance with theApple Filing Protocols: through this compliance, PSN creates the firstAppleShare environment that does not require a dedicated Macintosh as aserver, the company claims, noting that previous attempts to networkMacintoshes without a dedicated server, notably TOPS, have not conformed toAppleShare and thus are unable to run many programs that are important toMacintosh users - especially database applications; PSN uses Apple'sAppleShare client-user interface, file permission levels and privileges, andfile and record locking, so that multi-user databases like FoxBase and 4thDimension can be used with other Macintoshes in the network; the economies ofpeer-to-peer networking are preserved, while the network acts fully likeAppleShare to users; PSN will be introduced nationally in the US in firstquarter 1990, and costs $190 for one user, $290 for two, $530 for four,$1,000 for 10.andM;- o -andM;Ingres Corp says that its Ingres 6 relational database is now available toIBM RT Unix system users.andM;- o -andM;BBN Advanced Computers Inc has been working with Advanced RotocraftTechnology Inc of Mountain View, California, to port the Flightlab simulationdesign software to its new TC2000 parallel supercomputer: the TC2000, whichuses from eight to 504 Motorola 88000 processors, is to be used as the basisof helicopter flight training simulators at the NASA Ames Research Center.andM;- o -andM;Sybase UK gave Version 4 of its relational database its first UK outing atlast week's DEC User Show.andM;- o -andM;We've all heard of Silicon Valley, and Scotland's Silicon Glen, but now thearea of farmland west of Portland, Oregon and centred around Hillsboro iscalling itself &quot;Silicon Forest&quot;: the area has made a name for itself as thecentre for trade in the US of the Pacific rim, with Japanese companies NEC,Epson and Fujitsu  lready established alongside such native companies asCentral Point Software, FPS Computing, Intel, Sequent Computer Systems,Mentor Graphics and Tektronix.andM;- o -andM;The Mitel Inc arm of 51%-British Telecommunications Plc-owned Mitel Corp isnegotiating to acquire Coradian Corp for cash: Coradian, based in Latham, NewYork, is an independent interconnect company and did over $27m in sales in1988.andM;- o -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co revealed a few more details on its next generationPrecision Architecture microprocessor (CI No 1,322) saying that the designtechnology enables it to put its entire RISC on a single chip, thereby atleast doubling the performance of its minicomputers and workstations: thechip is about 2&quot; square and integrates nearly 1m transistors; it has 400 pinsand will be fabricated in 0.8 micron CMOS; it will draw less than 10W ofpower and will offer clock speeds greater than 48MHz; Hewlett claims thatinteger performance will reach 50 to 60 MIPS and floating-point performance12 MFLOPS to 16 MFLOPS; the chip will go into machines that will be priced atbetween $12,000 to $1m for high-end multiprocessors and a key feature is thecapability to build in different cache designs depending on whether the chipis destined for workstations that will be required to do intensivefloating-point operations or for integer-intensive business applications.andM;- o -andM;Surprise! Surprise! IBM's workstations chief James Cannavino says the nextgeneration RTs will run OS/2 - one day - as well as AIX: the news shouldcause few flutters because we all know the new RTs will use the MicroChannel, which is designed to support bus mastering, where any processor onthe bus can take over the system or run concurrently without reference to any&quot;main&quot; CPUso it should be child's play to do an 80386 or 80486 board for OS/2to plug into the box; IBM and Microsoft have said that they would be doingOS/2s for other architectures, so there may be a native version, but thereseems little point.andM;- o -andM;The Council of Ministers of the European Community has reached a compromiseon liberalisation of telecommunications services, approving the Commission'sproposals for all telecommunications services apart from basic telephony andtelex to be opened up to competition: from April 1, electronic mail,electronic data interchange and other value-added services will beliberalised, and from 1993, competition in packet and circuit switching is tobe introduced; the rules also set limits on licensing restrictions.andM;- o -andM;The shareholdings in the Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH West German cellularconsortium are Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH, 51%; Pacific Telesis InternationalInc, 26; Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, 10%; Cable andamp; Wireless Plc, 5%;Lyonnaise des Eaux SA, 2.5%, with the other 2.5% being shared by smallholders which include the National Associations of Electrical and AutomobileTrades; Mannesmann says it expects the system to become profitable in 1994.andM;- o -andM;Turns out that the presence of the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank inMannesmann-Kienzle's pan-German digital cellular consortium was a key reasonfor the team, which also includes Cable andamp; Wireless Plc, winning thefranchise: the minister, Christian Schwarz-Schilling praised the prominentrole played by small- and mid-size companies in the consortium - the bank'sholding involves the West German cooperative banks, for which the it acts asa clearing house and central bank - and the branches of all the small bankswill be used as sites for cellular radio transmitters.andM;- o -andM;Wang Laboratories Inc chief financial officer Eugene Bullis handed in hisresignation last Friday.andM;- o -andM;With growing unrest in the Philippines salaries soaring in South Korea andTaiwan, Hong Kong's future increasingly uncertain, Malaysia and Singapore areseeing an enormous boom in inward investment: Sony Corp has made Malaysia itsmain offshore manufacturing base in Southeast Asia, and now Fujitsu Ltd isconsidering making Malaysia its main offshore semiconductor base, with a moveto fabrication, for the 1990s, with Singapore becoming a regional sales anddesign centre.andM;- o -andM;And SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV id to invest $130m over the next threeyears, $60m between 1990 and 1992 to boost wafer fabrication to 100,000 5&quot;wafers a year from the present 40,000, another $30m to upgrade local chippackaging and $40m to upgrade semiconductor assembly and test operations inMalaysia.andM;- o -andM;Mercury Communications Ltd has beaten British Telecommunications Plc to thepunch on charging for directory inquiries, and will slap a 50 pence charge oneach call from January 1, although 50 pence will buy up to three differentsearches so users should save queries up.andM;- o -andM;The world's largest IBM and IBM-compatible systems exhibition will take placeat the NEC in Birmingham from February 27 to March 1 1990, with over 250exhibitors taking part, including professional institutions; focussed onsystems for companies of any type, size and location and covering mainframe,mid-range and smaller systems users it will provide a visitors serviceprogramme comprising over 60 seminars, workshops, technical clinics andconsultany sessions; there will also be a feature on security with input bythe Department of Trade andamp; Industry: over 20,000 visitors are expected and awide range of solutions will be provided; it will be opened by Rt Hon NormanFowler MP.andM;- o -andM;Nintendo Co is under fire from the Antitrust Subcommittee of the House ofRepresentatives Small Business Committee, which found &quot;serious anti-trustquestions&quot; in an investigation of Nintendo's business practices in the US:Nintendo had US sales of $1,700m last year in a video games market put at$2,300m, and projects $2,600m this year in a market estimated at $3,400m, andis alleged to have enforced restrictive software agreements, createdartificial shortages of games cartridges to push up prices, and put pressureon retailers not to sell competing products; its practice of installing adevice in its games players that prevents them from running third partysoftware was also questioned by the committee.andM;- o -andM;Tektronix Inc has been zapped with a patent infringement suit from GrummanAerospace Corp, alleging that some colour graphic computer terminals from theBeaverton, Oregon company infringe a US patent owned by Grumman: Tek says itbelieves that it does not infringe any valid claim of the Grumman patentbecause the display terminal features claimed in the patent were available interminal products sold by at least one other manufacturer more than one yearbefore the patent application was filed, and because the patented displayfeatures would have been obvious at the time the alleged invention was made.andM;- o -andM;I met a traveller from an antique land...andP;  In Egypt, IBM, despite no visiblepresence, is regarded as the eminence bleue behind the economy, and thefavourite joke is that IBM stands for the three expressions that sum up thenational ethos, which leaves Spain's manana trailing in its wake as theepitome of bustling activity and efficiency by comparison: I is forInsh'Allah, B is for Bukra and M is for Malaysh - literally God willing,tomorrow and never mind, in reality, God knows, you should be so lucky, andyour problems are no concern of mine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
