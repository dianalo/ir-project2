News that Georgia Pacific Corp. had offered to acquire GreatNorthern Nekoosa Corp. in a cash deal valued at more than $3billion jolted the market out of its recent slumber, analysts said.The market had declined five straight sessions last week andrecovered only slightly on Monday.   ``The bid for Great Northern has revitalized the deal syndromeand the paper group,'' said Larry Wachtel, equities analyst withPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Paper stocks have floundered in recent months. In addition, WallStreet had reacted negatively to the collapse earlier this month ofproposed deals involving UAL Corp. and AMR Corp., parent companiesof United and American airlines. The failure of a UAL pilot-ledgroup to get necessary financing for the deal helped trigger themid-October stock plunge.
