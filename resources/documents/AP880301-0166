The railroad plans to reopen May 12 as a seasonal tourist lineout of Skagway, said Marvin Taylor, vice president and chiefexecutive officer for the White Pass andamp; Yukon Corp. Ltd.   ``Everything is a go,'' Taylor said in a conference call fromSkagway. ``We anticipate 50,000 passengers this first year.''   For a $65 ticket, tourists will get a 3{-hour, 40.8-mile roundtrip to the peak of the White Pass. Most of the route shadows theDeadhorse Trail, which miners followed into the Klondike goldfields in 1898.   The railroad took the place of the trail in 1900 and ran untilOctober 1982, carrying passengers and freight the 110 miles betweenSkagway and Whitehorse, capital of the Yukon Territory.   The line closed after losing its freight business during aworldwide mining slump. The 800 people of Skagway lost 150 railroadjobs; Whitehorse lost 50.   White Pass is trying to sell its freight equipment, and Taylorsaid unless there's an unforeseen development boom in Whitehorse,it's unlikely the full line will reopen.   But tourism may prompt further expansion in 1989 and after,Taylor said.   The line will stop short of the Canadian border this yearbecause the railroad did not have time to negotiate the crossing.   The reopening was assured when the Alaska Teamsters and UnitedTransportation unions agreed Monday to contract concessions, Taylorsaid. The primary concession allows the train to run withthree-person crews instead of the traditional five-person crew usedon freight lines, he said.   The May-through-September business will employ more than 20people during the season and four to six people year-around, Taylorsaid.   It will cost about $1 million to get the line running by May 12,he said.   The line itself is in fairly good condition, but the passengercars need substantial renovation, he said. The railroad plans torun up to four round trips a day, carrying an average of 250passengers each.</TEXT></DOC>
