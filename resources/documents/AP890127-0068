GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Little can be done to prevent highlyradioactive nuclear waste from leaking out of storage tanks on theHanford nuclear reservation, a federal contractor says.   ``They deteriorate and wear out,'' said Bill Klink, a spokesmanfor Westinghouse Hanford Co., referring to the storage tanks hiscompany is responsible for handling. ``It's not due to lack ofmonitoring.''   U.S. Department of Energy documents show that at least 9,500gallons of radioactive nuclear waste leaked from the tanks in 1988.   The documents indicate that at least seven of 149 agingsingle-walled tanks leaked last year, adding to the more than500,000 gallons that have leaked into soil surrounding themillion-gallon, single-shelled tanks since the late 1970s.   Jim Thomas of the Hanford Education Action League, aSpokane-based citizen's watchdog group, called the latest leaks ``adrop in the bucket'' compared to past leaks.   ``But environmental contamination is still happening,'' he saidThursday.   The Energy Department said the leaked wastes stay near the tanksand don't enter the groundwater, posing no environmental or healthrisks.   Klink said 115,000 gallons that leaked from a tank in 1973 havestayed within 165 feet of that tank.   Single-walled tanks are no longer used. At least 95 of the tankshave had pumpable liquids transferred into 28 newer double-walledtanks on the site.   The wastes are byproducts of more than 40 years of plutoniumproduction for nuclear weapons at the south-central Washington site.   Hanford is generally considered the most contaminated of the DOEproduction sites, and estimates for cleaning it up run to $57billion over the next 50 years.   Some of the single-shell tanks date back to the Manhattan Projectbeginnings of Hanford in the early 1940s, and over the years atleast 66 of the single-shell tanks have been classified as ``assumedleakers.''   However, a large volume of non-pumpable but moist ``salt cake''remains at the bottom of the tanks. Energy Department officialsadmit they are unsure how to permanently dispose of those highlyconcentrated wastes.</TEXT></DOC>
