One man called it a miracle.   During three days of negotiations that resulted in agreementWednesday night, both sides had said it was the last chance forpeace in Nicaragua. The formal, 60-day cease-fire is to begin April1, but they agreed to extend a truce declared for the talks.   Virgilio Godoy, president of the opposition Independent LiberalParty, said Thursday: ``I believe that the agreement is a hope. ... It is not a question of saying now who won and who lost in theagreement, but that Nicaragua and thousands of mothers who havesons in the war won.''   Alonso Moreno, who owns a shoe store and has three nephews inthe army, said: ``This is the most important thing that hasocccured since 1979 when the Somoza dictatorship was overthrown.''   In a broadcast Thursday, the rebel Radio Liberacion said, ``The(Nicaraguan) Resistance has taken an initial step to end thehostilities in Nicaragua, a very significant step.''   El Nuevo Diario, a pro-government newspaper, asked a question inits banner headline: ``Cease Fire! Peace Explodes?''   Enrique Bolanos, president of the private enterprise council andstaunch government critic, called the pact ``a miracle,'' andadded: ``Perhaps the Sandinista Front will finally comply with itsword.''   During the negotiations at Sapoa, on the Costa Rican border 90miles south of Managua, President Daniel Ortega made a suprisevisit and said it was time ``to bury once and for all the militaryconfrontation.''   Rebel leader Alfredo Cesar told journalists at the meeting: ``Itis not just a chance to achieve peace and harmony, but the onlychance.''   Leaders of the Sandinistas and the U.S.-sponsored Contras stoodside-by-side on a makeshift dais Wednesday night in Sapoa, sang thenational anthem together and signed the cease-fire.   During the three days, both sides retreated from hard positions,especially the Sandinistas, who stand to gain the most from anagreement that would virtually end the insurgency.   The Contras agreed not to accept military aid and to receivenon-lethal supplies exclusively from neutral organizations. TheReagan administration, which has financed the rebels since theybegan fighting in late 1981, has been seeking congressionalapproval of more funds.   Provisions of the agreement meet requirements of the regionalpeace plan signed Aug. 7 by all five Central American presidents _ending the fighting, granting political amnesty and restoringdemocratic freedoms.   Opponents of the Sandinistas say they promised democracy whenoverthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979, butinstead established a Marxist regime.   Although the cease-fire does not begin officially until April 1,both sides said they would continue the battlefield truce theydeclared on Monday, the first day of negotiations.   Beginning Monday, also in Sapoa, negotiators will draw the linesof areas to which rebels will go during the first two weeks of theofficial cease-fire.   Nothing is said in the agreement about the Contras laying downtheir weapons, so that may be another subject taken up in nextweek's meetings. In past negotiations, the rebels insisted onkeeping their weapons until provisions of any accord were carriedout.   Also not mentioned is a reduction of the 80,000-member regulararmed forces, largest in Central America. The government claims tohave 300,000 people under arms, including army, reserves andcivilian militia.   Gradual amnesty is provided for Nicaragua's 3,300 politicalprisoners, beginning Sunday. The deal also guarantees``unrestricted freedom of expression,'' demanded by the rebels, andpermits all exiles to return home.   With verification that the Contras have moved into the trucezones, they can send up to eight delegates to participate innational talks now under way in Nicaragua as part of the regionalpeace plan, the agreement says.   The Sandinistas agreed that the ``issues related to militaryservice will be dealt with.'' Contra negotiators had insistedforced military service be ended.   Ortega's government granted a rebel request that compliance withthe agreement be verified by a commission formed by Cardinal MiguelObando y Bravo and the secretary-general of the Organization ofAmerican States, Joao Baena Soares.   Both were witnesses to the talks and it was Baena Soares whoread the final document aloud. Obando y Bravo had mediated previousnegotiations outside the coutnry.</TEXT></DOC>
