This process can also beutilized to clean beach sands contaminated by accidental heavy oil spills.In the case of oil contaminated sands, a single stage extraction hasyielded a 99% recovery of hydrocarbons and clean sands (containing lessthan 0.1% of hydrocarbons) which are thus safe to be returned to theenvironment. In the case of petroleum bottom tank sludge, it was necessaryto proceed with a double stage extraction with the addition of a wettingagent. A dosage of a Na/sub 2/SiO/sub 3/ aqueous solution of 1% by weighthas proven efficient, allowing an 82% recovery of hydrocarbons, withonly 0.5% of hydrocarbons content in the solid residues. 11 refs., 4figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
