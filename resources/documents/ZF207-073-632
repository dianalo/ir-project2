VGA can't do it,'' he said.andM;CTX sells VGA fixed-frequency monitors and is planning to introduce an800-by-600 monitor Stewart called a ''limited multiscan'' device.andP;  Hepredicted that 800 by 600 will become the new high-level standard, while VGAwill become the base standard for home and small-business users.andP;  ''The costdifference is so small between EGA and VGA that VGA will replace a lot of thepurchases by low-end users,'' he said.andP;  ''For $30 to $40 more for a VGA card,and $30 to $50 more for a VGA monitor, you get downward compatibility andhigher resolution.''andM;Indeed, many buyers choose multiscan monitors because they fear that softwarewill be introduced that requires capabilities beyond those found in VGA,according to Amnon Rosen, product marketing manager at Relisys, in Milpitas,Calif.andP;  The company markets computer peripherals for Teco Electric andamp;Machinery Co. of Taiwan, including VGA and multiscan monitors.andM;But multiscan monitors are not without their own weaknesses, according toRosen.andP;  ''Multiscan monitors are more complicated,'' he explained.andP;  ''Inorder for them to be all things to all situations, it's basically acompromise.'' Some multiscan monitors aren't able to match the performance offixed-frequency monitors at each resolution, and users should try every modefirst before they buy a multiscan, he said.andM;The super VGA resolution of 800-by-600 pixels has not been fully establishedas a standard because no one has written a standard driver to run existingsoftware at that resolution on all graphics boards and multiscan monitors,said Jeff Mazierek, marketing manager for video products at Zenith DataSystems, the Glenview, Ill., systems and VGA monitor manufacturer.andM;With standard VGA, users can run a piece of VGA software on any card,Mazierek said, because boards have been standardized.andP;  ''Until you cantransport 800-by-600 software from one graphics card to another with nomodifications, it's a sideways standard,'' he said.andM;Mazierek downplays the notion that multiscan monitors protect a user'sinvestment if new graphics standards emerge.andP;  ''If you need to do super VGA,buy a Multisync, but don't let a dealer tell you a Multisync gives youprotection against obsolescence, because unknown standards are unknownstandards,'' he warned.andM;Desktop-publishing applications look good in 800-by-600 resolution, andhigher resolutions are good for computer-aided design software, Maziereksaid, but both can be run successfully on VGA monitors.andM;Buyers need to look above all at the applications users will be running andthe types of systems they will be using, according to Neil Strauss, productmanager at NEC, in Wood Dale, Ill.andP;  ''If a corporate buyer has multiplesystems -- PCs, ATs, XTs, Apple Macintosh IIs,'' he said, ''a multiscanningmonitor with VGA capabilities makes more sense because they can standardizearound one monitor.''andM;Although multiscan monitors are generally more expensive than VGA monitors,they offer users wide-ranging compatibility at a time when graphics standardsare changing rapidly, said Strauss.andP;  While VGA is the current standard, hesaid, super VGA offers 37 percent more resolution for essentially the sameprice point.andM;''NEC has done a great job of touting that fear of obsolescence,'' said ChrisCockill, marketing manager for monitors at Amdek Corp., a wholly ownedsubsidiary of Wyse Technology in San Jose, Calif.andP;  Amdek markets both VGA andmultiscan monitors.andP;  Because of market uncertainty about standards, NEC wasable to capture a significant share of the monitor market with its Multisync,but VGA monitors began to outsell multiscan monitors in the U.S.andP;  marketabout midway through 1988, according to Cockill.andM;VGA began to take off last year because major vendors such as IBM and CompaqComputer Corp. incorporated VGA capabilities into their systems.andP;  Also, VGAboard prices fell and more VGA-supporting applications began to be introducedlast year, she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
