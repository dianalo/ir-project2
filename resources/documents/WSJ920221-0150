Just ask Bunting Biological Control Ltd. of GreatHorkesley, England. The company is breeding millions of thethree-millimeter Rambos. It aims to sell them this spring orsummer to greenhouse-vegetable growers in need of troops todeploy against the dreaded Western flower thrip, an avidmuncher of peppers and cucumbers.</LP><TEXT>   Bunting's brochure describes how the anthocorids operate:&quot;Both the adults and the nymphs feed by inserting theirproboscis-like mouthparts into the prey and sucking out thebody juices.&quot; Not just one or two helpings, either: Buntingpromises that its bugs will drain as many as 15 thrips a day.The predators also snack on aphids and spider mites. Ifnothing else is around, they devour one another.   But it's a bug-eat-bug business, and greenhouse farmerscan't be too fastidious about the thuggish habits of some oftheir allies, known in the trade as &quot;natural enemies&quot; or&quot;beneficial insects.&quot;   For a few dozen mite-size European and U.S. companies,finding and breeding these natural enemies is becoming afast-growing business.   Although greenhouse farmers began dabbling with naturalenemies in the 1930s, such pest control remained little morethan a curiosity for decades. After World War II, newchemical pesticides proved so devastating that few farmersbothered with any other weaponry. Then, in the 1960s and1970s, some farmers began to doubt that it was healthy forpeople who work in glasshouses to spray lots of chemicalsaround.   One of the doubters was Jan Pieter Koppert, a Dutchgreenhouse grower whose respiratory problems prompted him toexperiment with natural enemies for his own use in the late1960s. Soon he was selling killer insects to his neighbors.Now Koppert B.V., owned and managed by the late Mr. Koppert'ssons, exports brandname bugs as far afield as Australia andCalifornia. In the past five years, the company's annualsales have more than tripled to around 30 million guilders($16.6 million). That, says export manager Cor-Jan van derElzen, makes Koppert &quot;the main leader in the world&quot; ofnatural enemies. (The company also supplies bumble bees forpollination work-along with bee food called BeeHappy.)   Koppert and rival companies -- such as Bunting and Chr.Hansen's Bio Systems AS of Denmark -- remain bullish on bugs.Tough environmental rules in many countries are pressuringfarmers to use fewer chemical pesticides and making thosepesticides more expensive to develop. At the same time, someconsumers are clamoring for unsprayed fruit and vegetables.   So far, most people aren't willing to pay the premium forunsprayed produce. But Joop van Lenteren, an expert onnatural enemies at the Agricultural University in Wageningen,the Netherlands, thinks the trend is toward fussierconsumers. &quot;In Germany,&quot; he says, &quot;they're even more keen onclean food than we are here.&quot;   To satisfy that demand, bug breeders scour the wildernessfor new predators and parasites. The trick is to track downthe most efficient killers. Frogs, for instance, may eat lotsof insects, but they can't be relied upon to go after anyparticular pest. Certain types of mites, on the other hand,zero right in on thrip larvae.   So Koppert breeds mites and packs them into plasticbottles marked Thripex. It advises cucumber growers tosprinkle the mites over their plants like salt.   Among other hired guns on the market are aphid midges,lacewings, ladybird beetles, mealybug destroyers, gypsy mothsand onion maggots. The predatory snail (Rumina decollata)stands ready to pounce on garden snails.   Since no one can patent a snail or an insect, competitioncan be fierce; new suppliers keep crawling out of thewoodwork. Two years ago, Biolab of Italy opened astate-of-the-art bug plant near Cesena, partly financed bygovernment funds. Koppert is so wary of rivals that itrefuses to let visitors tour its labs or breeding plant. Mr.van Lenteren says Russian scientists plied him with vodka,unsuccessfully, to learn bug-production secrets.   Even a few giant companies are getting involved. Germany'sBASF AG, for example, sells capsules full of ichneumon fliesto combat the infamous corn borer. Imperial ChemicalIndustries PLC of Britain doesn't sell insects but offerschemical pesticides designed for use alongside them.   Rather than breeding bugs, big chemical and drug companiesgenerally are more interested in developing bacteria, fungiand viruses to serve as &quot;biopesticides.&quot; County NatwestWoodMac, a British stockbroker, estimates that the worldmarket for biopesticides -- most of them based on a bacteriumcalled Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis -- totals $120 million ayear, or 0.5% of the global market for agrochemicals. Naturalenemies constitute an even smaller business.   Even Mr. van Lenteren, one of the world's leadingadvocates of natural enemies and other types of biologicalpest control, doesn't think they can render chemicalsobsolete.   For now, natural enemies are unleashed mainly ingreenhouses. Outdoors, a bigger variety of pests andunpredictable weather make it hard for warrior bugs toperform reliably; most farmers stick to chemical weapons fortheir field crops. Still, natural enemies are sometimes usedoutdoors for strawberries, apples, cotton and corn.   Mr. van Lenteren thinks more outdoor applications arepossible. He preaches using natural enemies along withchemical pesticides in a way that minimizes the need for thelatter.   Toward that end, he and his colleagues in Wageningen areusing government grants to study bug warfare.   Remember Pavlov's dog? Meet van Lenteren's insect. When ayoung woman wore a potent perfume in the lab one day, Mr. vanLenteren's students were seized with an inspiration: Why notteach parasitic wasps to respond to an artificial odor, suchas perfume? The students wafted various perfumes over thewasps as they laid their eggs. Later the wasps associatedcertain scents with egg-laying.   &quot;Now we know we can train them to many things -- toshapes, to colors,&quot; marvels Mr. van Lenteren. Why bother?Because, he says, insect breeders will be able to sell bugstrained to search out a particular enemy more effectively.Mr. van Lenteren says he's in negotiations to license thetechnology to several companies.   The professor also is teaming up with botanists to try tomake life easier for natural enemies. A case in point isEncarsia formosa, a parasitic wasp used to counter the whitefly. &quot;Encarsia formosa,&quot; Mr. van Lenteren admits, &quot;is arather stupid animal in several respects.&quot; Peering throughtheir microscopes, entomologists noted that the wasp keptstumbling into the minute hairs on cucumber leaves as itlooked for white-fly larvae. &quot;It's like a drunken man on asidewalk with many lamp posts,&quot; Mr. van Lenteren explains.   The obvious solution was to seek out a strain of cucumberswith hairless leaves. But researchers found that Encarsiaformosa, when set loose on a hairless leaf, zipped around sofast it was liable to pass over a juicy larva without evennoticing. Somehow, the wayward wasp had to be slowed down.The answer: promote a type of cucumber with 50% less leafhair.   With such discoveries, Mr. van Lenteren says, &quot;we arescoring in international journals.&quot;   Suppliers boast about their lab feats, too. One of the hotareas of research revolves around uses for nematodes.   Bunting already is promoting its Nemasys brand ofnematodes as a scourge for sciarid flies and vine weevils.Stored in a special gel, the nematodes come in convenientpackages of 50 million. James Finch, Bunting's marketingmanager, concedes it's difficult for customers to be sure ofthe count in each pack. &quot;They have to trust us,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
