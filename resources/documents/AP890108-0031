George Muhoho was quoted by the Sunday Nation as saying a newsurvey has shown the number of black rhinos in four special reservesat slightly more than 600, about 100 more than the governmentestimated a year ago.   The minister attributed the higher figure to improved surveytechniques, stiffer anti-poaching measures and better breedingconditions in the rhino sanctuaries: the Lake Nakuru, Nairobi,Amboseli and Aberdares national parks.   A single rhino horn, actually a spiked tuft of hair, can fetch upto $24,000 in the Far East, where it is used for medicinal purposes,and in the Middle East, where the horns are prized as ornamentalhandles for daggers.   Private wildlife conservation experts have generally placed thenumber of rhinos in this East Africa nation at well below governmentestimates, but Muhoho said the new survey indicates ``the situationis not as desperate as some people have tended to make it sound.''   In the early 1970s, there were thought to be 60,000 black rhinosin Africa. Most private estimates put the figure at around 3,000today.   Concerned about mounting assaults on wildlife, the governmentissued shoot to kill orders to law enforcement officers late lastyear. Since then, at least 12 poachers have been killed and dozensarrested in the crackdown.</TEXT></DOC>
