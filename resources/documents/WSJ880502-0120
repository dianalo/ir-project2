Peoples Natural Gas said the increase, if approved, would boost its annual revenue by about $22.5 million and raise the typical residential customer's average monthly gas bill to $69.08 from $63.47. If the utility commission follows its normal schedule for public hearings, the rate change, if granted, would go into effect next January.    The utility cited the need &quot;to maintain quality service.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
