It was one of the biggest orders for new aircraft and followedmultibillion dollar purchases announced recently by AmericanAirlines and Delta Air Lines.   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn said the airline will place firm ordersfor 20 A330-300 twin-engine wide-body aircraft and take options onan additional 20.   Airbus, a consortium backed by Britain, France, West Germany andSpain, will begin delivering the 301-seat aircraft to TWA in late1994 or early 1995, depending on engine selection.   Commenting on the deal in a prepared statement, Icahn said:``This concludes an aircraft evaluation study begun more than twoyears ago, and reaffirms our commitment to TWA's long-term growthand prosperity.''   The Airbus jets are being purchased under a fleet renewalprogram aimed at replacing TWA's L-1011 and 747-100 aircraft, hesaid. TWA intends to operate the A330 on major North American andtrans-Atlantic routes.   ``The A330, which offers the most advanced technology availabletoday, also gives us the option to expand the airline to takeadvantage of market opportunities,'' Icahn said.   Under the terms of the deal, TWA has the right to convert up to10 firm orders and 10 options to Airbus Industrie's A340s, whichare four-engine, very long-range wide-body aircraft.   Operating the A330 will cost 33 percent less than operatingTWA's L-1011s, the airline said. The A340, which also seats 301passengers, has a range of 7,600 nautical miles.   The A330 and A340 jetliners were launched as a single program inJune of 1987. The two models are similar in looks with the onlymajor difference being in the number of engines and in theirengine-related systems.   The A340 will begin service in May 1992 and the A330 will takeits first commercial flight in September 1993.   Jean Pierson, president and chief executive officer of Airbus,said TWA's planned order represents the ``beginning in a long andfruitful relationship for both companies.''</TEXT></DOC>
