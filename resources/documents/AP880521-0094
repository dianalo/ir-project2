In Kwangju, 165 miles south of the capital, hundreds of studentsbattled riot police with firebombs and rocks.   There were no reports of injuries or arrests, and the countrywas relatively calm after four days of clashes betweenanti-government protesters and riot police in Seoul and othercities.   In the capital, the students interrupted a parade of about30,000 people honoring the anniversary of the birth of Buddha andmarched to the front with banners denouncing Roh and the UnitedStates.   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' and ``Down with the militarydictatorship!'' the students yelled, raising clenched fists.   There were thousands of riot police along the parade route, butthey did not try to stop the students until they got near the U.S.Embassy. The students did not try to approach the embassy.   Riot police removed students who blocked a main city streetafter the march. Students dispersed and there were no incidents.   Anti-U.S. sentiment has been high in the recent wave ofanti-government protests, the worst political unrest since majorriots last summer. Radicals claim the Roh government is kept inpower by the United States.   Protesters have burned American flags, attacked U.S. diplomaticbuildings and demanded the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based inSouth Korea under a mutual defense pact.   Police officials hunted Saturday for radical student leadersbelieved behind an attack Friday on the U.S. Embassy in whichstudents stormed the walls and hurled bombs.   Investigators said the attack apparently was organized byradicals responsible for other attacks on U.S. diplomatic officesand offices of the governing Democratic Justice Party. Policequestioned seven students arrested in the embassy attack.   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said atleast 20 other students were suspected of plotting the attack.
