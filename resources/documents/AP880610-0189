(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker saidFriday they don't have the money to buy back PTL, but they'repreparing to submit a plan to the bankruptcy trustee that wouldallow them to go on television and ``quite a bit else.''   ``We don't have money in the bank. We haven't asked for peopleto put money in the bank. We will launch a campaign, perhaps in thenext few days, to do some of that,'' Bakker said at a newsconference.   He said he had promises of support from some businesses in RockHill and Fort Mill, near PTL's Heritage USA headquarters, but hewouldn't provide names.   ``We have commitments from various people. The finances is notthe problem. This is a very spiritual problem,'' he said, withoutelaborating.   Bakker, who met privately on Thursday with bankruptcy trusteeM.C. ``Red'' Benton, said he's drawing up a proposal that would putthe PTL founders back on television.   The Bakkers were forced off the air out of the $160 millionevangelical empire they founded in a sex and money scandal. Theystepped down in March 1987 after revelations that ministry moneywas used to pay a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, to keep quietabout a sexual encounter she had with Bakker. That was followed byfurther revelations of a lavish lifestyle led by the Bakkers.   ``We are preparing in the next 48 hours a plan to present to Mr.Benton and that would include air time and quite a bit else,''Bakker said.   Asked if he would use the air time to raise money, Bakker saidhe and his wife want to use most of the time helping people.   ``My goal is to spend most of my time ministering. We havesomething that we want to say. We've learned a lot over the lastyear and five months. We want to spend time helping hurting people,to help people that are going through similar situations,'' Bakkersaid.   ``Needless to say, we're going to have to have help to pay thebills,'' he added.   Thursday's meeting was Bakker's first detailed discussion withBenton. The trustee told Bakker that if his presence proveddisruptive at Heritage USA, he would ``really lay down the law withhim.''   Bakker has said he is raising money to buy back PTL, but hasdeclined to discuss details, saying God was giving him direction.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds is to rule Thursday on aliquidation plan for the ministry that calls for most of its assetsto be sold, with the church and television studios to be leasedback by PTL.   Mrs. Bakker, who underwent treatment for an addiction toprescription drugs before the couple's departure from the ministry,said she has not used drugs to cope with stress since their fallfrom PTL.   ``I haven't had a pill in a year and five months!'' she said.``I made it totally, God and me. That was nice. It was good to beable to do that.''</TEXT></DOC>
