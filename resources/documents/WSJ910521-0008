In a 9-0 ruling, the high court said that state lawsshould be used to determine whether a demand for action bythe directors must be made. Judges should look to the law ofthe state in which a company is incorporated, according tothe opinion written by Justice Thurgood Marshall.</LP><TEXT>   The decision reversed the ruling of a federal appealscourt in Chicago that would have made it tougher forshareholders to get derivative lawsuits to federal court andeasier for directors to take control of such actions.   The lawsuit involved in the case is called a shareholderderivative action because the shareholder sues to vindicatethe company's interests in the absence of action by thecompany. If damages are assessed, they go to the company, notthe shareholder. Such lawsuits are allowed under numeroussections of the federal securities laws. Under most federalsecurities laws, the question of when a demand must be madeis determined by state law.   The issue of whether state law controls demand ondirectors in lawsuits under the Investment Company Act of1940, however, was placed in doubt by the July 1990 decisionof the Chicago appeals court. The appeals court ruling,written by Judge Frank Easterbrook, a corporate law expert atthe University of Chicago Law School before becoming a judge,created a new federal rule that demand on directors wasalways required even if it seemed futile.   The high court rejected the appeals court's rule. On theissue of the division of governing power within acorporation, the high court said, &quot;Where a gap in the federalsecurities laws must be bridged . . . federal courts shouldincorporate state law.&quot;   Corporate laws in all states require that beforeshareholders file a derivative lawsuit, they must make ademand on the directors to file the lawsuit. But most states-- including Delaware, the leader in corporate law -- allowan exception: No demand need be made of the directors if theshareholders believe it would be futile because, for example,the directors have a conflict of interest.   Shareholders prefer not to make a demand because thedirectors are then free either to take over the lawsuit or toreject the need for it. If the directors reject the action,their decision would receive substantial deference in court.   One argument for requiring a demand for action in mutualfund cases is that it could be more effective than with othercompanies. This is because the Investment Company Act, whichregulates mutual funds and investment advisers, requires thatsuch companies have a number of directors on their boards whoare independent of the investment adviser or disinteresteddirectors.   Harvey Pitt, a Washington securities lawyer who filed abrief for the Investment Company Institute, a trade group formutual funds and advisers, said the ruling may prolonglawsuits. &quot;This decision relegates these claims to thevagaries of particular state laws when the court had theopportunity to create a uniform federal rule that would, ineffect, eliminate some unnecessary litigation.&quot;   The decision reinstated part of a shareholder lawsuitcharging that Cash Equivalent Fund Inc. paid excessive feesto its investment adviser, Kemper Financial Service Inc., aKemper Corp. unit, and that Kemper caused the fund to misleadshareholders about the fees in a proxy statement. Theshareholder didn't ask the fund's directors to file suit fordamages allegedly caused by the proxy statement because thedirectors had approved issuance of the proxy statement andbecause they were too closely tied to Kemper.   A federal judge in Chicago dismissed the lawsuit. Afederal appeals court in Chicago reinstated the lawsuit onthe question of whether the fees were excessive, but ruledthat the allegation of proxy fraud was barred because theshareholders failed to ask the directors to take action.(Kamen vs. Kemper Financial Services Inc.)   In other action yesterday, the high court:   -- Upheld, by a 4-4 tie, a Florida tax on intangibleproperty, including wholesale and retail car financing, thatwas challenged by Ford Motor Co. The case may cost Ford $1.7million plus interest for tax years 1980 through 1982. (FordMotor Credit Co. vs. Department of Revenue)   -- Ruled, 7-2, that the Constitution doesn't prohibitstates from requiring a defendant in a rape case to giveadvance notice of his plan to introduce evidence of hissexual activity with the victim. Justice Sandra O'Connorwrote the decision. Justices John Stevens and ThurgoodMarshall dissented. (Michigan vs. Lucas)</TEXT></DOC>
