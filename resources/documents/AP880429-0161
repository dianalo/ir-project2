Byrd saidtoday he had tentatively decided to open debate May 11 on aU.S.-Soviet treaty to ban medium-range nuclear missiles, but onlyif the two superpowers could clear up differences on verificationand other issues.   The State Department, meanwhile, urged the Senate ``to moveforward expeditiously'' and said the treaty's anti-cheatingprovisions were effective.   Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman, said the Sovietshad taken a ``restrictive'' view of the right of U.S. monitors toinspect containers for missile components as well as access toSoviet facilities.   He said the State Department had raised the issue with theSoviets at a senior diplomatic level and was waiting for a reply.``So we will see what we get,'' Redman said.   The State Department official called the Soviet interpretationof the verification procedures unacceptable.   Byrd made clear that debate would not begin on May 11 _ lessthan three weeks before President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev meet in Moscow _ if areas of concern were stillunresolved.   Reagan administration officials are urging the legislators toapprove the pact before the May 29-June 2 summit to enhanceprospects for the two nations agreeing to other weapons restraints.   The majority leader said he is especially concerned by publishedreports quoting ranking Soviet military leaders as appearing to beback away from mutual understandings on what would be permittedunder treaty provisions allowing on-site verification inspection. sByrd called on both Washington and Moscow to quickly deal with thatquestion as well as others, including a treaty ambiguity on whatconstitutes a weapons delivery system and whether or not such``Star Wars'' weapons as those using laser beams or particle raygeneratiors are covered by the pact.   Earlier, a U.S. arms control official said the embassy in Moscowhas been in touch with Soviet officials to resolve the differencesthey raised on how to verify compliance with the treaty.   ``We anticipate that it'll be cleared up,'' the official of theArms Control and Disarmament Agency said Thursday, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``We don't think this will be a bigproblem.''   Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a closedsession this week, voted sharp cuts in the budgets for intelligenceagencies because of irritation at the administration's failure toseek improved surveillance systems for use in verifying the treaty,the New York Times reported today.   Committee chairman Sen. David L. Boren, D-Okla., said in aninterview that he is prepared to filibuster the treaty unless theWhite House requests the money the intelligence panel believes isneeded for monitoring, the Times reported.</TEXT></DOC>
