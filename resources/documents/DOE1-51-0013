Their substrate properties in cell-free systems with E.coli DNA polymerase I, calf thymus DNA polymerase {alpha}, phage T4 DNApolymerase, reverse transcriptase coded by the avian myeloblastosis virus,and also calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase have beenstudied. It has been shown that aNTP(3'NH{sub 2}) and aNTP(3'-N{sub 3}),act as DNA-chain-terminating substrates for DNA polymerase {alpha}, phageT4 DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase, and terminal transferase. Onthe other hand, DNA polymerase I makes practically no use of these compoundsas substrates.</TEXT></DOC>
