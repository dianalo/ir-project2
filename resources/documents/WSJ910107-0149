The outage, ATandamp;T's biggest since January 1990 when asoftware glitch knocked out service for nine hours, fouled uplong-distance communications in and out of New York, haltedtrading at several New York financial markets and crippledtraffic at East Coast airports.</LP><TEXT>   ATandamp;T has backup systems that keep phone traffic movingwhen a disruption occurs in one of its big switching centersby automatically finding an alternate path around theproblem. However, Friday's disruption turned out to be asevered fiber-optic communications cable that carried morethan 100,000 two-way communications circuits in and out ofManhattan. ATandamp;T is still installing facilities to back up thetransmission systems and cables in its network, according toWilliam J. Carroll, ATandamp;T's vice president of networkoperations.   When Friday's disruption occurred, ATandamp;T apparentlycouldn't reroute everything that was being pumped through thecable. &quot;Our network operation center showed thatstatistically 40% of the calls were being completed,&quot; said anATandamp;T spokesman. But &quot;anything coming into the New York areafrom the rest of the country or overseas could not getthrough.&quot;   The disruption underscores the vulnerability of thenation's communications networks, especially now thatcarriers are replacing multiple copper cables with singlehigh-capacity fiber-optic lines. In Friday's accident, thebreaking of a single cable about as big around as a thumbrunning through a conduit in Newark, N.J., virtually tiedphone and data traffic in knots for most of the day.   Ironically, ATandamp;T inflicted the problem on itself. It saidone of its work crews pulling old cable through a conduitaccidentally severed the new cable.   ATandamp;T is not the only company that suffers from suchdisruptions. Its long-distance rivals, MCI CommunicationsCorp. and U S Sprint Communications Co., a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc., regularly suffer accidental cablebreaks, most often because of a construction accident. Thedifference is that ATandamp;T has most of the market, so itsoutages are felt by a much larger group of customers.   On Friday, many of those customers went through anagonizing day of service disruptions. The breakdown crippledvoice and radar data communications at air-traffic controlfacilities operated by the Federal Aviation Administration inthe New York, Washington and Boston areas for about fivehours, according to an FAA spokeswoman.   She said the cable carries radar information toair-traffic control facilities. When the cut occurredcontrollers could not get the flight number of planes,altitude, speed and direction on their radar screens. Trafficwasn't halted, she said, but it was slowed to allow intervalsof 30 miles between planes instead of the usual five miles.   The crippled cable also shut down the New York MercantileExchange, the Commodity Exchange and other New Yorkcommodities exchanges for more than three hours, disruptingtrading in oil and gold. It was the fifth time in a year thattechnical problems have hampered the nation's financialmarkets.   The Nasdaq over-the-counter stock market was alsodisrupted as half the computer screens at some New York-areabrokerage firms went blank. Officials said about 15% of allNasdaq computer terminals stopped operating.   Although the New York Stock Exchange said it wasunaffected by the phone trouble, traders said Big Boardvolume was probably reduced because many brokers wereimmobilized. A below-average 140.8 million shares changedhands on the Big Board Friday.   The Financial Instrument Exchange, which offers futurescontracts on U.S. Treasury issues, the European Currency Unitand on a U.S. dollar index, suspended trading at about 10:30a.m. EST and didn't resume until about 2:30 p.m. On a normalday, the exchange said, it trades $252 million of futures andoptions, but that only about $56 million of contracts weretraded Friday.   ATandamp;T's rivals said they cooperated with ATandamp;T customers toprovide them with access to long-distance service. &quot;Peopleare scrambling to find out what they can do to get through,&quot;said an MCI spokeswoman. At Sprint, customers seekingalternative service caused Sprint's traffic to increase inthe morning but this &quot;leveled off&quot; by midday, a spokesmansaid.   ---   William Power contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
