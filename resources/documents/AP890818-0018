Although the inquiry has centered so far on the Boeing Co., amajor defense contractor, it is expected to extend to other defensecontractors, government officials familiar with the case saidThursday.   The investigation is being run by the Pentagon inspectorgeneral's office and is separate from the 3-year-old ``Ill Wind''investigation of bribery and influence-peddling in the awarding ofDefense Department contracts.   The ``Ill Wind'' investigation conducted by the JusticeDepartment focused on the role of private consultants in obtaininginside information about Pentagon contracts.   The separate Boeing case became public Tuesday when Richard LeeFowler, a former Boeing official, was indicted by a federal grandjury in suburban Alexandria, Va., on 39 counts of theft, conspiracyand fraud. The charges stem from his alleged trafficking inclassified documents, according to the indictment.   ``It's part of a continuing investigation by the Department ofDefense inspector general's office into how certain contractors andtheir employees have illegally trafficked in classified documents,''said one Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity.``How Fowler obtained these documents is the subject of furtherinvestigation.''   According to the 68-page indictment, Fowler, while he worked forBoeing in Washington as a senior marketing analyst from 1978 to1986, obtained hundreds of the Pentagon's most sensitive documents.   Among those papers were Air Force and Navy directives on budgetproposals, along with the Defense Department's five-year plan,according to the indictment.   The five-year plan is closely held within the Pentagon because itis the chief defense spending blueprint used by the secretary ofdefense, Joint Chiefs of Staff and civilian service leaders inmaking major budget decisions about weapons.   In addition, Fowler received three National Security Councildecision directives signed by former President Reagan, theindictment charged. Distribution of those documents is extremelylimited.   The three documents dealt with the Strategic Defense Initiative,a proposed shield against nuclear attack, the indictment said, butit did not give more details.   Although Fowler had a high-level security clearance, he didn'thave authorized access to those papers, the indictment said.   Fowler refused to discuss the case. Contacted by telephone at hissuburban Virginia home, he said only, ``I do not wish to commentwhatsoever on any of this.''   Fowler was fired by Boeing in September 1986, said Harold Carr, aspokesman for the company in Seattle. The Wall Street Journal saidthe firing was because investigators were looking at Fowler'sactivities.   Carr said Boeing is cooperating with the investigators.   ``There has been a considerable number of requests for documents,papers, records and so on,'' he said. ``We have provided those andwill continue to answer requests for them.''   After obtaining the papers, Fowler passed them along to Boeingofficials and other, unnamed contractors, the indictment said. Healso allegedly obtained some documents that had been specificallyrequested by Boeing officials.   None of the other people under investigation are identified,although the indictment said some of other alleged conspiratorscreated separate log books to keep Pentagon officials from knowingthat Boeing had the unauthorized classified documents. Boeing hasauthority to handle certain classified documents because it is amajor defense contractor.</TEXT></DOC>
