The pound could be poised to breach the 3.20 West German marks level, analysts say. In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.8915, up from $1.8832 Thursday. It climbed to 3.1853 marks from 3.1681. For the week, the pound rose 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the mark. Traders say the Bank of England intervened in Friday dealings, selling sterling against dollars and marks, but the intervention appeared to be aimed at smoothing market conditions.    The upward pressure on the pound, which has created strains between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, led to more political turmoil in Conservative government ranks.    On Friday, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary and a longtime Thatcher loyalist, appeared to support the chancellor's quest for more stable exchange rates, against the prime minister, who says governments shouldn't &quot;buck&quot; the currency market. In a speech in Scotland, Sir Geoffrey repeated the government line that the U.K. will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System &quot;when the time is right.&quot; But he departed from his text to say: &quot;We cannot forever go on adding that qualification to the underlying commitment.&quot;    Sir Geoffrey's remarks were construed as evidence that government policy is in disarray. Weekend press speculation cast doubt on Sir Geoffrey's political future and suggested that Mr. Lawson may want to leave office later this year, adding to concern about exchange rate policy among Conservative members of Parliament.    In a radio interview yesterday, Sir William Clark, chairman of the Conservative parliamentarians' finance committee, called on Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson to issue a statement saying that agreement exists on exchange rate policy.    Aides to the prime minister's office said yesterday that there isn't a rift between Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson; that she isn't planning a cabinet reshuffle; that Sir Geoffrey has made remarks about the monetary system before, and that more explicit remarks by Mrs. Thatcher about the pound would only play into the hands of speculators. &quot;There are no plans at all for a statement&quot; about the pound, a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher said.    Normally such political uncertainty is poison for a currency, but Geoffrey Dennis, international currency economist at London stock brokerage James Capel andamp; Co., said the turmoil is contributing to upward pressure on the pound. Mr. Lawson has so far failed to sway Mrs. Thatcher to more stable exchange rates, Mr. Dennis noted. If the chancellor or Sir Geoffrey were to quit, there would be even less resistance to the prime minister's free market views, he said.    Traders said Friday interest in the pound was sparked by a Bank of England report that was widely interpreted to mean that the central bank favors higher interest rates to combat domestic inflation. The bank said in its quarterly report, issued late Thursday, that it would prefer a different monetary policy mix from its current one, saying: &quot;a combination of a stronger currency and lower interest rates doesn't represent an ideal response to current (inflationary) concerns and a different balance would be desirable.&quot;    The pound also received a boost when Mrs. Thatcher, during parliamentary question time Thursday, declined to say if she agreed with Mr. Lawson's view that the pound shouldn't appreciate further.    These factors helped convince market participants that the government's ability to control the pound's ascent is limited. J. Thomas Stanley, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said, &quot;I think we're on our way to 3.20 (marks).&quot;    Away from day-to-day concerns, economic factors have bolstered the pound. Later this week, the British government will publish data on employment, average earnings, money supply, bank lending and retail prices, which are expected to underline the present robust economic growth but also the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures.    Although some economists in the City, London's financial district, fear that strong domestic demand could lead Britain into a damaging balance of payments crisis later this year, foreign investors are more impressed by evidence of the country's economic dynamism. Another reason for currency dealers to flock into sterling is the lack of movement in dollar exchange rates against other major currencies. This limits opportunities for trading profits.    &quot;The quieter the (dollar) market is in general, the more we're looking for currencies with a discernible trend to them,&quot; Trevor W. Woodland, vice president of foreign exchange at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;Since there isn't a lot of activity in other currencies, it's very easy to zero in on sterling.&quot;    In other trading Friday, the dollar firmed but was little changed against other major currencies as dealers squared positions ahead of tomorrow's release of U.S. trade data for March. Economists figure that a robust rise in U.S. exports probably pared the trade deficit from February's $13.83 billion.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose 30 cents an ounce, to $452.20, in moderate trading Friday. The estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.50 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Friday, May 13, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
