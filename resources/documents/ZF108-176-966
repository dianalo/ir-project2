ZimmermanandM;In its latest move to become a one-stop shop for microcomputer-to-AS/400connectivity, Andrew Corp. recently submitted a letter of intent to purchaseEmerald Technology Inc., according to sources close to the company.andM;If accepted, the deal will make Emerald Technology Andrew Corp.'s fourthacquisition over the past three years and will give Andrew's Network ProductsDivision another host of 5250-emulation products for the IBM AS/400 midrangesystem.andP;  A decision on the tender offer is expected by the end of this monthor early in March, according to the sources.andM;Charles Nicholas, vice president of corporate finance at Andrew Corp., ofOrland Park, Ill., declined to comment on any pending acquisitions thecompany may be considering, but said the firm is still interested inpurchasing companies that suit its needs and fill product gaps.andM;Shifting FocusandM;&quot;We'll continue to look at other acquisitions,&quot; Nicholas said, &quot;but the pacewon't be as fast as it has been.andM;&quot;Our focus is shifting to internal development solutions because the pieceswe've set in place have given us those resources,&quot; he added.andM;The publicly held Andrew Corp., whose 52-year history is primarily inmicrowave communications, entered the connectivity market in 1987 when itpurchased Local Data Inc. and Scott Communications Inc., two relatively smallcompanies that sold protocol converters and other connectivity products, andmerged them to create the Andrew Network Products Division.andM;That division is charged with researching, developing and manufacturingconnectivity and communications products, according to Nicholas.andM;&quot;The forming of the Network Products Division was part of our plan ofdiversification,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In the 52 years we've been in the communicationsbusiness, we have always looked for areas to take our understanding.andO;Connectivity is one of those areas.&quot;andM;With the introduction in June 1988 of IBM's AS/400, and as the popularity ofthe AS/400 and related 5250-emulation products grew, Andrew Corp. sought toboost its product line and compete in the nascent market with companies suchas IDEAssociates Inc. and Mux Lab Inc.andP;  To that end, it acquired KMW SystemsCorp. last November for approximately $12 million.andP;  KMW added a Macintoshsolution to Andrew's equation with a line of products that connect MacintoshIIs and SEs with AS/400s.andM;The purchase of Emerald Technology, a Washington-based company that recentlyannounced new hardware and software for both PC- and Mac-to-AS/400connectivity, would beef up both sides of Andrew's product line.andM;Analysts who have followed Andrew Corp. and its Network Products Divisionwere intrigued by the prospect of another acquisition.andM;&quot;The kinds of decisions Andrew makes are not the kinds that are going to makeyou go out and hock your house to buy stock in their company,&quot; said EugeneMcAulliffe, a senior analyst at Manning and Napier Advisors Inc., afinancial-advising firm in Rochester, N.Y.andM;&quot;But if you go back down the line and look at their situation, you say, 'Wow,they've done a lot,' &quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Another acquisition would be interesting.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
