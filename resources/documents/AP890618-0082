KENT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In 1985, Ohio voters put their faith in thestate's coal industry by passing a $100 million bond issue to helputilities find ways to burn the high-sulfur coal mined in the regionwith less air pollution.   Now some utilities and miners say that faith and the investmentin clean-coal technology could be for naught under President Bush'sclean-air proposal.   Bush's proposal would require the nation's 107 dirtiest powerplants _ including 14 of Ohio's 50 coal-burning power plants, themost in any state _ to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 5 milliontons by 1995 and 10 million tons, or half the current level, by theyear 2000.   Sulfur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain, which hasbeen blamed for destroying plants and aquatic life and damagingbuildings. Because prevailing winds go from west to east, pollutionin the Midwest contributes to acid rain in the East and Canada.   Utility and state officials say new technology to burnhigh-sulfur coal cleanly won't be ready by Bush's deadline, and thatpower plants would have to switch to expensive low-sulfur coal minedelsewhere.   ``It's probably the worst proposal we could have,'' said LarryWard, president of United Mine Workers District 6, which covers Ohioand part of West Virginia. ``Are we talking about just eliminating aproblem or putting people out of work?''   Along with job losses, utility officials expect significant rateincreases.   ``We have more to lose under this proposal than any utility inthe country,'' said John Dowd, senior vice president ofColumbus-based American Electric Power Co., the nation's largestpurchaser of coal.   AEP, which owns nine plants in Ohio, is the parent company ofeight utilities that serve 7 million customers in seven states.   Dowd said Bush's deadlines could mean the end of AEP's two $800million pressurized fluidized bed combustion development projects inBrilliant, Ohio, and New Haven, W.Va.   Pressurized fluidized bed combustion is designed to remove 90percent of the sulfur from burning coal by churning it with crushedlimestone and air in a pressurized combustion chamber. Limestonechemically combines with the sulfur to form a solid that won't go upthe smokestack.   Part of those projects and several others are being fundedthrough the clean-coal bond issue. So far, about $63 million hasbeen awarded.   ``Certainly some of those could go down the tubes,'' said HowardJohnson, who heads clean-coal technology for the state's CoalDevelopment Office. ``I'm sure some of them will be available foruse (in 2000), but some of the more promising technologies are justnot far enough along and won't be ready until after the year 2005.''   If utilities have to switch to low-sulfur coal mined in otherstates, Gov. Richard Celeste said, Ohio could lose half its coalindustry jobs, based on an assumption that the plan would erase themarket for 50 percent of Ohio's high-sulfur coal.   Ward said about 4,200 union coal miners' jobs were at risk inOhio ``and for each one of those, there's four or five spinoffjobs.'' Johnson said the coal industry employs 7,500 people in Ohio.   But Donn Young, conservation chairman for the Central Ohio SierraClub, said ``it's necessary to meet those emissions standards assoon as possible.''   ``It's a fallacy to say there'll be a loss of jobs. Look at theimpact in the northeast and in Canada. The fishing industry hasreally been affected by acid rain,'' he said. ``It's a matter oftrading jobs someplace for someplace else.''   An alternative to low-sulfur coal would be smokestack scrubbers,which remove particulates and sulfur dioxide from a plant's exhaustbut cost millions of dollars.   Dowd said the employment picture may not be as bleak as someunion leaders contend, because there could be a mix of low- andhigh-sulfur coal, and some plants would use scrubbers to reduceemissions.   ``But we have a responsibility to our ratepayers, our customers.We have to look at the least costly method of compliance. And thatwill mean a reduction in employment,'' he said.   Dowd said Bush's plan would mean higher electricity rates.   ``We're looking at double-digit rate increases in Ohio, Indianaand parts of West Virginia, but I can't be precise at this time,''he said.   Bush's proposals call for power plants by 1995 to emit no morethan 2.5 pounds of sulfur dioxide for each 1 million British thermalunits of energy they produce, and by the year 2000 no more than 1.2pounds. Most large Ohio plants emit about 5 pounds per million BTU,and one plant emitted 7.8 pounds per million BTU last year,according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
