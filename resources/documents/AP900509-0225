The company's president, Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., succeeds J.Richard Munro today as co-chief executive of the media andentertainment giant.   The top-level changes had been widely expected, and the50-year-old Nicholas said no major changes are expected because heand Munro have worked together so closely for years.   ``This represents continuity, not change,'' Nicholas said.   The 59-year-old Munro announced he was stepping down at thefirst annual meeting of Time Warner shareholders since Time Inc.completed its acquisition of Warner Communications Inc. earlierthis year.   Munro had been chief executive at Time since 1980 and chairmansince 1986. He shared both titles with Warner boss Steven J. Rosssince Time bought a controlling interest in Warner and changed itsname last year.   A onetime Sports Illustrated publisher, Munro had said he wantedto serve only 10 years as chief executive, and the company spelledout succession plans when the Warner deal was first announced inMarch 1989.   Munro's contract at Time Warner entitled him to deferredcompensation of nearly $4.3 million if he retired from his posts onor before this May 31.   Nicholas, 50, has been with Time since 1964 and president since1986.   ``The future belongs to him and to Steve and to the remarkablepeople at Time Warner. I wish you all godspeed,'' Munro toldshareholders and others who filled the 1,150-seat Ziegfeld Theaterfor Tuesday's 2{-hour meeting.   Ross, 62, becomes the company's sole chairman with Munro'sretirement. Plans are for him to share the chief executive's postfor four more years, after which he is expected to leave that jobentirely to Nicholas.   Time spurned a $12.2 billion buyout offer from ParamountCommunications Inc. last summer and proceeded with a $14 billionpurchase of Warner. The deal, completed in January, created a worldleader in magazines, books, films, recorded music, TV productionand cable TV systems.   Time never allowed shareholders to vote on the Paramount offer,but there were few complaints expressed Tuesday about Time'stactics.   Shareholders rejected a proposal, which was opposed bymanagement, calling on Time Warner to either redeem or submit to ashareholder vote a key anti-takeover defense known as a poison pill.   William Steiner, who presented the resolution, said Timemanagement had cost its shareholders about $5 billion by rejectingParamount's $200-a-share offer without allowing a vote.   About 43 percent of the shares voted in favor of the proposaland 57.8 percent against, the company said.   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Time Warnerstock fell 50 cents a share to $94.   Ross said uncertainty about congressional efforts to impose moreregulations on the cable industry had cut the value of Time Warnerstock by $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Time Warner is the nation'ssecond biggest cable TV system operator.   One shareholder asked Ross to explain why he deserved hislucrative benefits package, under which he is entitled to deferredcompensation of about $122 million.   Ross said the package mainly reflected stock bonuses and stockappreciation rights he was granted in 1987 at Warner, and noted thecompany he founded had grown at a remarkable pace in recent years.   Munro, who will stay on as a Time Warner director and chairmanof its executive committee, joined the Time magazine circulationdepartment in 1957.   He became president and chief executive of Time Inc. in 1980,and took on the title of chairman in 1986, passing the president'sjob to Nicholas.   Munro defended the decision to combine with Warner rather thantake the Paramount offer, saying the new company offered apotential ``long-term return on investments that would far outstripany single short-term gain the sale or breakup of Time mightbring.''   Time Warner lost $256 million on revenue of $10.8 billion lastyear, mainly because of costs associated with its purchase of amajority stake in Warner. Nicholas said a top priority is reducingthe company's $10.8 billion debt.</TEXT></DOC>
