The suit filed by the Justice Department charged that Singer Co.and Link Flight Simulation Corp., fabricated higher cost estimatesto offset price concessions they might be forced to make duringcontract negotiations with the Defense Department.   The action was taken in a False Claims Act lawsuit originallyfiled under seal last fall in U.S. District Court in Baltimore byChristopher Urda, a former Link Flight price administrator.   The amended complaint filed by the Justice Department supersedesthe original suit filed by Urda and Taxpayers Against Fraud.   Under the Civil War-era False Claims Act, private citizens maysue on behalf of the government if they suspect fraud. Thegovernment is empowered to take over the case if it determines thatthe original claims have merit.   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the $231 millionclaimed by the government made the case one of the largest suitsbrought under the False Claims Act.   Urda's complaint, which was ordered unsealed by U.S. DistrictJudge Herbert Murray at the government's request, had accused Singerof arbitrarily adding a 10 percent labor charge onto originalestimates for the flight simulators over a 15-year period.   But the government's amended complaint only alleged price fraudon seven contracts between 1983 and 1986 on flight simulators andrelated projects. Link Flight had received a sole-source fixed-pricecontract to produce the million-dollar devices for the Pentagon.   The simulators are used by the military to train pilots to flyCobra, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook helicopters, F-4 and F-16 fightersand B-52 bombers.   The government's complaint charged that it added the phonycharges to ``cost estimates which it believed were least likely tobe questioned by the government or which it believed the governmenthad the least ability to evaluate.''   The government claimed that it lost $77 million as a result ofthe alleged fraud and sought treble damages under the law, pluscivil penalties of $5,000 to $10,000 for each false claim submittedto the Pentagon.   The phony bid information was approved by the company's bidcommittee, which usually was comprised of the president of LinkFlight and various operating units of the company, the lawsuit said.   Singer was acquired in 1987 by corporate raider Paul Bilzerian'sSinger Acquisition Co. Last year, Link Flight, based in Binghamton,N.Y., was sold to CAF Industries, a Canadian company which renamedit CAE Link Corp.   Company officials at Singer's corporate headquarters in Stamford,Conn., said Phil Watson, Singer's general counsel, had left for theday and was unavailable to make a comment on the lawsuit.   Bilzerian's secretary in Tampa, Fla., said he was alsounavailable for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
