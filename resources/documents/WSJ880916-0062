The price wasn't disclosed.    The Southfield, Mich., auto-parts maker said the operations are still profitable and that it made the sale &quot;with considerable reluctance.&quot; The company said recent sanctions imposed by the U.S. government would make it difficult to make any future investments, threatening the South African operations with &quot;stagnation.&quot; It said it also feared future sanctions would make maintaining that relationship even more difficult.    Federal-Mogul will continue to supply the two businesses, which have $25 million a year in combined sales.    &quot;Obviously we're against apartheid,&quot; said Charles B. Grant, Federal-Mogul vice president and controller. &quot;But we would like to stay. We think we've done good things, and we think that withdrawing will not serve that same interest.&quot;    Federal-Mogul stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $46 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
