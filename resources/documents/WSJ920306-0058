Delta, based in Atlanta, said it was purchasing AirbusIndustrie A310-300s for delivery next year. The new jets willreplace some of the 21 older Airbus aircraft acquired whenDelta bought Pan Am Corp.'s European routes last August.</LP><TEXT>   The order came as a blow to Boeing Co., Airbus's rival,which already was bracing for a possible slowing in Delta'sschedule for receiving airliners already on order.   The Airbus order comes just a day after Delta said it wastrying to control its costs as a means of coping with therecession and that it might consider slowing deliveries -- aslarger rivals AMR Corp. and UAL Corp. have done -- althoughno changes were expected for about two months. Deltacurrently has 549 jets in its fleet and has orders andoptions for an additional 454.   Even if Delta does decide to rejigger its fleet, it stillneeds the additional international capacity that the A310sgive it. Since November, Delta has more than doubled itstrans-Atlantic service, and it says European bookings forsummer look strong. Delta also has plans to expand in thePacific, although plans to build a hub in Taipei, Taiwan,this year have been put off for a year as part of itscost-cutting effort.   Delta made its largest expansion, the Pan Am purchase,just as AMR's American Airlines and UAL's United Airlinesstarted cutting back. The airline industry has been buffetedby two years of the largest losses in aviation history. Deltaitself has predicted it will continue to have losses throughits fiscal year, which ends June 30.   The Airbus A310-300 is a twin-engine jet that will seat179 passengers in Delta's first-class, business-class andcoach-class configuration. It has a range of more than 5,000nautical miles and will be powered by Pratt andamp; Whitney PW4152engines. According to Avmark Inc., a Virginia airlineconsulting firm, a new Airbus A310-300 is valued at $66.5million. It competes directly with Boeing's 767-ER jet.   Delta, whose fleet includes Boeing, McDonnell DouglasCorp. and Lockheed Corp. jets, had never bought Airbusaircraft until it acquired Pan Am's. John Leahy, Airbus'ssenior vice president of marketing and sales, said hiscompany was very pleased with Delta's order. &quot;We've beentrying to persuade Delta to buy our aircraft for years,&quot; hesaid. He wouldn't comment on whether Airbus provided aspecial price for the nine aircraft or if there were otherincentives. &quot;The airplane sells itself,&quot; he said.   But in Seattle, a Boeing spokesman suggested that pricingwas at the heart of Delta's decision not to add to itscurrent fleet of &quot;extended-range&quot; 767-300s and to chooseAirbuses instead. &quot;In some cases, our competition can makebetter offers than we're able to make,&quot; the spokesman said.   Boeing, which has long complained that the AirbusIndustrie European consortium can benefit from governmentsubsidies when it prices airliners, noted that Delta &quot;hasbeen a very long-term customer for Boeing planes, and weexpect them to be a customer in the future.&quot;   The Boeing spokesman wouldn't comment on Delta's hintsthat a slowing of its delivery schedule for aircraft may bein the works.   Separately, Boeing confirmed that Air New Zealand isdelaying until 1996 the delivery of six smaller 737 aircraftit had expected to take in 1994. Air New Zealand's decision,which Boeing said reflects the airline's plan to install new&quot;hush kits&quot; to enable some older 737s to meet newairport-noise restrictions, is another sign that there hasbeen some softness in 737 demand lately. Boeing recently saidthat in October it will reduce the monthly output of theplane to 14 from 21.</TEXT></DOC>
