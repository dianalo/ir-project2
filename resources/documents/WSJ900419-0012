Fewer than one in six Canadians who state a preference nowsupport the Conservatives, according to the polls.</LP><TEXT>   No governing party has ranked so low in Canada since theGallup Organization started polling Canadians on theirpolitical party preferences in 1941. But the rulingconservatives hope to bounce back before the next electionmust be held, which by law is by the autumn of 1993.   Political analysts say the Conservatives' unpopularitycould deter the government from taking further tough actionto deal with the country's economic problems, including thegovernment's big budget deficit.   &quot;The mood in the country is pretty sour,&quot; said Angus Reid,president of Angus Reid Associates Inc., an opinionresearcher.   President Bush observed the anti-Mulroney sentiment firsthand last week when he and Mr. Mulroney attended the TorontoBlue Jays home opener against the Texas Rangers. When Mr.Mulroney stepped onto the field for the ceremonial firstpitch, the big SkyDome stadium crowd booed loudly.   Canadians are particularly upset over the government'splan to introduce a 7% consumption tax Jan. 1 to replace amore narrowly based manufacturers sales tax.   Mr. Mulroney's government also is taking much of the blamefor a constitutional dispute that has rekindled fears aboutQuebec's breaking away from the rest of Canada. The disputeconcerns a proposed amendment that would give increasedpowers to the provinces and recognize largely French-speakingQuebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada.   Canadians also are distressed over Canada's high interestrates and pessimistic about Canada's economic prospects.Short-term Canadian rates are more than five percentagepoints above comparable U.S. rates.   In addition, some Canadians have objected strongly torecent government decisions to shut down much of thecountry's unprofitable passenger rail services and to relaxthe Royal Canadian Mounted Police dress code to permitmounties of Sikh faith to wear turbans.   Mr. Mulroney is sticking to his unpopular measures,including the planned consumption tax, which has been passedby the House of Commons but still needs to be approved by theSenate.   &quot;Doing what is right for the nation often times meansdoing things that are difficult and unpopular,&quot; he told theHouse of Commons.   Two Conservative members of Parliament were expelled fromthe party caucus last week for voting against the consumptiontax. But caucus solidarity remains basically strong, mainlybecause of fears that party squabbling would soon lead to thegovernment's defeat.   &quot;Mr. Mulroney has clearly established his authority overthe party caucus as no other Conservative leader has done ina generation,&quot; said George Perlin, a Queen's Universitypolitical scientist.   Dalton Camp, a former senior adviser to Mr. Mulroney'scabinet, said that while Mr. Mulroney's leadership of hiscaucus &quot;continues to be masterful,&quot; the prime minister &quot;hasonly a tenuous grip on his party beyond Parliament Hill.&quot;   Voter unhappiness is strongest in western Canada,particularly the traditional Conservative stronghold ofAlberta. Many Albertans have switched to a new right-wingparty, the Reform Party, which had the support of almost athird of the province's voters in a recent poll.   Many Tory members of Parliament believe the ConservativeParty's current problems will fade away by the autumn of 1993and the party will be able to repeat its feat of 1988 when itbounced back from a slump to win re-election.   The Conservatives have some grounds for their hopes, saidMr. Reid. He predicted the consumption tax will be lesscontentious a year from now and by election time the economyshould be healthier.   But to get re-elected the Conservatives will need anotherbig issue like Canada's 15-month-old free trade pact with theU.S., Mr. Perlin said. The trade pact, which was supported bya majority of Canadians, was the main issue in the 1988election.   The Conservatives are expected to be able to counterattackmore effectively against their critics after the oppositionLiberal Party, at a June 23 convention, picks a new leader tosucceed John Turner, who is retiring. The new Liberal leaderwill give the Conservatives a focus for their attacks onLiberal policies. Jean Chretien, a minister in former PrimeMinister Pierre Trudeau's government, is heavily favored towin the Liberal leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
