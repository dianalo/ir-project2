They demanded money, at one point asking for $100 aday, and threatened to kill her brother if she didn't comply,the former Saigon resident adds.   But Mrs. Cantrelle, who at at five foot one and 85 poundslooks barely strong enough to stand up against a good breeze,didn't intend to back down. &quot;We have a responsibility toclean up our community,&quot; she says. &quot;If we keep quiet, thingsare just going to get worse.&quot;   Instead of paying, she went to the police and pushedreluctant witnesses to step forward. Three men wereeventually arrested. Though authorities couldn't gatherenough evidence to win extortion convictions, the defendantswere found guilty in a state court here of assault andweapons charges. &quot;Without Suying there wouldn't have been acase,&quot; says Steven Harrold, the deputy district attorney whoprosecuted the case. &quot;She's a very brave lady.&quot;   The alleged shakedown of Mrs. Cantrelle's business is anall-too-familiar tale for entrepreneurs, who are oftenvictims of the rise in crime. Resisting criminals is hard --and scary.   Immigrant entrepreneurs such as Mrs. Cantrelle are oftenespecially vulnerable. Law-enforcement officials say theybelieve extortion against Asian businesses is widespread. Butvictims, often fearful of retribution, unable to speakEnglish well and harboring a distrust of the police that wasingrained in their homelands, rarely report the crime, theofficials say.   The dangers range from street gangs that terrorize Asiancommunities to more sophisticated groups such as the WahChing. A one-time Chinese youth gang, the Wah Ching hasturned into a &quot;significant organized criminal group&quot; withnationwide operations in everything from narcoticstrafficking and murder to extortion and loansharking,according to a 1989 report by the federal General AccountingOffice.   At the Cantrelle trial, an acknowledged Wah Ching memberadmitted to taking part in the beating of a vendor at Mrs.Cantrelle's store. He also told of extorting money from Asianbusinesses in San Francisco and coming to Sacramento lookingfor new victims. However, he denied making any extortionattempts against Mrs. Cantrelle's business and said thebeating stemmed from a personal dispute.   The testimony of Vi Khuu, the vendor who was beaten, showshow difficult it can be for a small business owner such asMrs. Cantrelle to buck the tide and fight such gangs. Mr.Khuu testified that in Vietnam suspected criminals couldbribe their way out of custody and go after their victimsagain. Mr. Khuu, who runs a jewelry counter in Mrs.Cantrelle's store, said he was afraid the same thing wouldhappen in the U.S.   What nudged Mr. Khuu and others to testify was theperseverance of Mrs. Cantrelle. As the problem unfolded,&quot;there were a lot of late-night sessions at people's homeswhere she convinced them they had to talk,&quot; recalls Mrs.Cantrelle's husband, Joseph. Mr. Harrold says there werepoints in the case where he was sure some of the witnesseswould have backed out if not for Mrs. Cantrelle. &quot;She was avery strong victim,&quot; adds Darrell Fong, the Sacramento policedetective who investigated the case.   Mrs. Cantrelle, who came to Sacramento from Vietnam in1974, has long been an activist. For years, she worked forsocial-service organizations. In her spare time, she hasraised money for local families in need and acted as aninterpreter for them with government agencies.   She says she started the Vinh Phat Market in 1984 largelyas a way to employ the increasing number of family memberscoming into the Sacramento area. The one-story building ofstucco and corrugated metal is part food store, part emporiumand part art mart. Live catfish and 50-pound bags of riceshare space with racks of rumpled suits, piles of shoes andbrightly colored oriental statues. She presides over it allfrom a windowless back office crammed with boxes of beautycream, cigarettes and other inventory.   Shortly after the money demands began in 1988, Mr. Khuuwas marched out from behind his jewelry counter at gunpointand beaten in the parking lot. He testified that the next dayhe received a telephone call demanding $3,000. &quot;He was beatenas an example to show they meant business,&quot; says Mr. Harrold.   At the trial, Mr. Khuu testified he didn't return to workfor three weeks out of fear for his safety. And Mrs.Cantrelle's brother testified he was told that if moneywasn't forthcoming, he should &quot;be prepared to buy a coffin.&quot;The defense contended that any dispute was due to money owedthe defendants by Mrs. Cantrelle's family, an assertion sheheatedly denied.   Several weeks after Mr. Khuu's beating, there was ashootout at the market between two of the defendants and alocal gambler. Though nobody was hurt, Mrs. Cantrelle saysthat helped convince remaining doubters of the need tocooperate with the police.   After she went to the police, Mrs. Cantrelle says shewalked out of Vinh Phat one evening to find four men in a carpointing a camera at her. Suspecting the worst, she hopped inher car and gave chase.   She wheeled her car in front of theirs at a red light,blocking them along with most of the intersection. Shemarched over, demanding the camera. &quot;I figured they wouldn'tkill me with everyone else around,&quot; she says. But the menmanaged to slip their car around hers and get away.   After all this, &quot;Suying has become a kind of cult heroine&quot;in the immigrant community in Sacramento, says PhilipIsenberg, a state assemblyman who sponsored a legislativecommendation for Mrs. Cantrelle as an immigrant who resistedgang wrongdoing. He also recently had her testify in supportof a bill to set up a statewide hotline for immigrants tophone in anonymous tips on criminal activities.   Mrs. Cantrelle is upset that more of her fellow Asianbusiness owners aren't speaking up as she has. She believesmany are being shaken down and silently paying. &quot;If they arebeing robbed, I don't feel sorry for them,&quot; she says. &quot;Theyhaven't stood up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
