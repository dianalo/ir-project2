Baker III saidtoday the United States reserves the right to use military forceagainst Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, anddismissed ``armchair generals'' who faulted the administration forfailing to support Tuesday's failed coup with American troops.   ``The United States retains the option to use American forces.That option has never been ruled out,'' Baker told the SenateFinance Committee. ``But if you're going to risk American lives,it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable.   ``You do so based on your own plans. At a time of maximumopportunity and advantage. You don't do so on the basis of someoneelse's plans and in response to rapidly changing circumstances,''he said.   At the Pentagon, one official said various military options werediscussed Tuesday with President Bush as the coup unfolded. Anotherofficial said: ``When it appeared as though Noriega might have beendethroned ... there were several options considered, none of whichwas going in and getting him.'' Both spoke on the condition ofanonymity.   Baker deftly sidestepped whether the administration played anyrole in the failed coup attempt, but he implied that the UnitedStates had kept its distance because the rebels had little chanceof ousting Noriega.   A number of members of Congress, including Sen. David Boren,D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee criticizedthe Bush administration after the short-lived coup for what theysaid was failure to support members of the special security unitthat tried to take over Noriega's central command post.   ``It's easy to be an armchair general,'' Baker said, withoutinforming the committee members whether the rebels had at leasttacit assurances of U.S. support, as some reports have suggested.   Baker said President Bush acted immediately to do two things _to safeguard American lives and to assure the security of thePanama Canal, just as the United States is obligated to do underthe Panama Canal treaties.   The treaties call on the United States to turn control of theAmerican-built canal at the end of the century and to maintain theneutrality of the waterway.   U.S. troops at the Southern Command in Panama said the situationtoday is calm but troops and civilians remained under a Deltaadvisory, which means they are to avoid unnecessary travel outsideU.S.-controlled areas, the Pentagon said.   Officials acknowledged Tuesday they had advance word of a coupattempt, but the president said the United States did not engineerit.   ``We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works,''said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, ``but until ithappens, you never know.'' He characterized the prior informationas ``rumblings.''   But Baker provided no details of the precise steps taken by theWhite House while events unfolded on Tuesday in Panama. He saidthey were breaking rapidly.   ``It is easy after the fact in one of these situations tosecond-guess the events by arguing that the United States shouldhave done something differently,'' Baker said.   He told the committee the administration considered Noriega'sgovernment ``an outlaw regime'' and would continue pressuring forhim to give up power.   ``Our policy has been to apply relentless pressure on theNoriega regime. Across the board _ diplomatically, economically andto defend American lives and United States rights under our PanamaCanal treaties,'' he said.   Some members of Congress said Bush could have provided militarysupport to the rebel forces which tried to depose Noriega. Thegeneral is sought in the United States on drug trafficking charges.   ``Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, rankingRepublican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee. Boren saidTuesday it was wrong for the United States, with its 12,000military personnel in Panama, ``to stand by ... and do nothing, andallow these people to fail.''   But Vice President Dan Quayle had said, ``We're not going to beinvolved in any kind of a coup attempt in Latin America,'' and thismorning Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a moderate Republican,dismissed the criticism. ``It's very easy to be an armchairgeneral,'' he told NBC.   The Washington Times today quoted congressional sources assaying that in advance of Tuesday's attempt, American militaryofficers in Panama led the rebels to believe they would get U.S.military help.   An unidentified senior administration official told TheWashington Post that rebel leaders had passed word at least threetimes this week that an effort to topple Noriega was imminent. Oneofficial told The New York Times that the United States had agreedto tae custody of Noriega if the rebels captured him. Anotherofficial told the Times that before it became clear Noriega had notbeen captured, the United States had asked to have him turned overand the rebels refused.   ``I want to see democracy in Panama succeed,'' Bush insistedafter it became apparent Tuesday that Noriega had squashed the coup.   ``Am I disappointed that Noriega is still there? Yes I am,'' hesaid later.   ``Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continueto press for Noriega's removal'' and his arrest to stand trial inthe United States, said Fitzwater.   Bush turned aside further questions Tuesday night at a statedinner for visiting Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.   But Quayle said, ``I`m not sure what we could have done'' tohelp the anti-Noriega forces. ``This is a situation that is goingto be handled within Panama. We're not going to be involved in anykind of a coup attempt in Latin America ... This is Panama'sproblem.''   Earlier Tuesday Bush gave verbal support to the still-battlingcoup leaders in comments to reporters. He said the administrationhas ``no argument'' with Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces, onlywith the dictator himself. Bush has made similar comments over thepast several months, in what some saw as barely disguised goadingfor the PDF to mount a coup.   Saying he hoped his words would be ``conveyed instantly'' toPanama, the president said, ``Our argument has been ... with Mr.Noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of Panama,''a reference to Noriega's invalidation of last May's election thatobservers said was overwhelmingly won by his opposition.   ``There were rumors around that this was some American operationand I can tell you that is not true,'' Bush told reporters at anOval Office photo session.   ``We did not take any action that would have constituted directinvolvement,'' said Fitzwater, adding that U.S. helicoptersobserved the fighting and troops were stationed ``around one of thecauseways there to protect access and rights and so forth.''</TEXT></DOC>
