Commodity price moves dominated the credit markets. At first, sharply higher commodity prices added to inflation worries, depressing Treasury bond prices slightly. But commodity prices later came off their highs, and bonds rebounded.    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds finished with gains of about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Trading was light, though, partly because of nervousness about a government report on inflation to be released this morning.    That report is likely to show consumer prices rose 0.4% in April, according to the average estimate of 16 analysts polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Consumer prices rose 0.5% in March and 0.2% in February.    But some analysts fear consumer prices rose as much as 0.6%. If so, that would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates slightly more to combat inflation. Many analysts say the Fed's policy committee, which met Tuesday, left credit policy unchanged but authorized additional credit-tightening to be implemented speedily if inflation worsens.    &quot;The direction of rates is still higher,&quot; contended William Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. However, he predicted that note and bond prices will continue to hover close to their current levels until next week, when a large new supply of Treasury issues will hit the markets.    The Treasury plans to sell $8.25 billion of two-year notes Wednesday. It also will sell $7 billion of five-year, two-month notes Thursday.    Despite yesterday's modest bond rally, &quot;The market is still bearish,&quot; said Kathy Jones, financial futures analyst at PaineWebber in Chicago. She attributed the gains to technical factors and predicted that traders will take their cue today from the consumer price report.    Some traders were surprised by the Federal Reserve's move to drain reserves from the banking system yesterday. But most agreed the Fed maneuver didn't represent any change in credit policy and was done purely to sop up excess funds in the banking system.    The Fed already has tightened its credit vise twice in the past two months. The federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans of reserves, averaged 7.04% in the week ended Wednesday.    That was the highest since the week of Oct. 21, when the funds rate averaged 7.37%, according to Richard Hoenig of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yesterday, the funds rate averaged 7.06%, a spokesman for Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. estimated.    Treasury Securities   The Treasury's new 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 rose to a price of 98 14/32 from 98 6/32. The yield declined to 9.28% from 9.31%. The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 climbed to 95 7/32 from 94 28/32, while the yield fell to 9.35% from 9.39%.    The Treasury's 9% notes due 1998 advanced to 98 30/32 from 98 25/32. The yield fell to 9.16% from 9.19%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. rose 2.95 points to 1210.07. It ranged between 1205.35 and 1211.81.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills were mixed. The rate on three-month bills fell to 6.14% bid from 6.20%, while the latest six-month bill rate rose to 6.54% bid from 6.53%.    The new two-year notes to be sold next Wednesday were quoted in when-issued trading at 8.06% bid. The five-year, two-month notes to be sold Thursday were bid at 8.67%.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   The Veterans Administration today is likely to increase its ceiling rate for guaranteed mortgages to 10.5% from 10%, according to some mortgage securities traders.    This would reflect recent increases in mortgage rates and a drop in prices of Ginnie Mae pass-through securities, traders said.    The VA ceiling has stood at 10% since early April, but the increase in interest rates since then has crimped loan volume. That's because mortgage originators must charge a substantial number of points to turn a profit when Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities, backed by 10% VA mortgages, are trading as far below par as they are currently.    Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% issues for June delivery were quoted at 95 3/4 bid and at close to 95 for delivery in August, when many originators expect to make deliveries of Ginnie Maes.    The VA generally announces changes in its ceiling on Friday afternoons. The last change, an increase to 10% from 9.5%, was announced April 1.    A half-point rise in the VA ceiling would make Ginnie Mae 10% securities the new current coupon issue, replacing the 9 1/2% issue.    Mortgage securities trading generally was light yesterday, with active issues finishing slightly higher. June Ginnie Mae 9% bonds, the benchmark issue, rose 2/32 to 92 3/4 bid. The yield fell slightly to 10.22% from 10.23%, based on a 12-year average life assumption.    The difference in yield between this issue and the 10-year Treasury note widened to 1.06 percentage points from 1.05 percentage points Wednesday.    Municipals   Municipal bonds were narrowly mixed in choppy trading influenced heavily by commodity prices.    In futures, the June municipal contract settled 9/32 of a point higher at 85 11/32. That left the contract 14/32 of a point below its Treasury counterpart.    Earlier this week, prices of municipal futures moved above Treasury futures for the first time in about eight months. But, pressured partly by sluggish demand for new issues, municipal futures have again fallen below their Treasury counterparts.    Foreign Bonds   Foreign government bonds generally were little changed in quiet trading.    In West Germany, activity was slow in both the new issue and secondary markets. The government's 6 1/4% issue due 1998 ended at 97.30 to yield 6.63%. That compared with 97.35 late Wednesday, to yield 6.622%.    Traders paid little attention to the West German central bank's decision, at a regular meeting, to leave monetary policy unchanged. Some analysts said the Bundesbank soon may tighten monetary policy in an effort to restrain inflation.    Uncertainty about the outlook for German interest rates may also deter borrowers from coming to the market, said one syndicate official. &quot;The rate levels have moved up so much recently that it has made borrowers wary of locking into a rate now, especially after the low rates we had seen for such a long time in Germany,&quot; she said.    Several analysts attributed the sluggishness of yesterday's activity partly to the fact that most of continental Europe's markets will be closed Monday. Traders said they spent much of yesterday evening squaring their positions so that they won't be left holding large inventories over the weekend.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bonds traded in a tight range, finishing at about the same levels as Wednesday. The government's benchmark No. 105 November 5% issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 4.775%, up from 4.75%. The June government bond futures contract settled 0.14 lower at 105.86, while the September contract was down 0.19 at 104.56.    British gilts declined in the morning but later bounced back to finish little changed. The government's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 was unchanged at 106 21/32 to yield 8.85%. The Treasury 12% issue due 1995 rose slightly to 112 21/32 from 112 19/32, while the yield slipped to 9.40% from 9.41%.    The Treasury's benchmark 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 was quoted late in the day at 118 to yield 9.45%. That compared with Wednesday's close of 118 6/32, to yield 9.43%.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed to slightly higher in light activity.    Only about $650 million of new investment-grade corporate issues hit the market yesterday, including a rare industrial issue backed by a letter of credit.    Dominion Textile (USA) Inc. offered $150 million of seven-year notes. The 9 7/8% notes were priced at par, a spread of 0.90 percentage point above the rate of the Treasury seven-year note. The issue came at a slightly wider spread against Treasurys than originally expected.    The principal and interest payments on the notes will be guaranteed by Barclays Bank PLC. Dealers said that guarantee enabled the Dominion issue to carry a significantly lower yield than it otherwise would have.    Dealers added that they could not recall the last time an industrial company launched a bond issue with a letter of credit supporting the principal and interest. Dominion Textile (USA) is a subsidiary of Dominion Textile Inc., the largest producer of textile and textile-related products in Canada.    Junk Bonds   A $150 million offering of debentures by CenTrust Savings Bank apparently wasn't as successful as the company had hoped.    The issue, initially planned as $200 million, was reduced to $150 million. The 15 7/8% senior subordinated debentures, due May 15, 2000, were priced at 98.675 to yield 16.125%. The debt was rated single-B-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-C-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    When Sandamp;P assigned the issue its tripleC-plus rating, it said, &quot;Tangible capital (of CenTrust) is thin, especially when adjusted for the substantial amount of risk on the balance sheet, in part reflecting the presence of a significant amount of high-yielding securities and private placements.&quot;    Traders said some investors were wary of the CenTrust issue because the bank's net income has continued to be heavily dependent on asset sales.    Sandamp;P, in saying that its outlook for the bank is positive, adds that it expects CenTrust to have future earnings less dependent on asset sales. Traders said some investors were also concerned about the level of non-earning assets on the company's balance sheet. </TEXT></DOC>
