<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0889 </DOCNO><TEXT>We analyzed angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors by in vitro autoradiographyin selective brain nuclei of control, salt-treated (1% NaCl in drinkingwater), deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-treated (DOCA pivalate, 25mg/kg sc weekly), and DOCA-salt-treated (DOCA + salt treatments) uninephrectomizedmale Wistar-Kyoto rats. After 4 wk of treatment, only the DOCA-salt groupdeveloped hypertension. ANG II binding increased in median preoptic nucleusand subfornical organ of salt- and DOCA-treated rats. DOCA-treated ratsalso showed increased ANG II binding in paraventricular nucleus. DOCA-salt-treatedrats showed higher ANG II binding in nucleus of the solitary tract andarea postrema, as well as in the areas mentioned before. Although saltand/or DOCA treatments alone increased ANG II receptors in some brainnuclei, after combined DOCA-salt treatment there was significantly higherANG II binding in all areas, except the median preoptic nucleus. Theseresults suggest that increased ANG II receptors in selected brain areasmay play a role in the pathophysiology of mineralocorticoid-salt experimentalhypertension.</TEXT></DOC>
