It states, &quot;When Congress raised the capital-gains tax rate in 1986, its concern wasn't revenue, but fairness.&quot; What is fairness? That point of view ignores taxes as a vehicle for government revenues, and instead emphasizes them as, in effect, a bludgeon to enterprising individuals who have taken professional and financial risks, and forfeited current consumption, in order to create financial growth. In brief, these individuals are our future investors in economic growth.    The basic premises of capitalism recognize that certain elements are deterrents to entrepreneurial activity, namely high taxes, but especially arbitrary penalties; this includes so-called &quot;fair&quot; tax rates imposed on the rare group of individuals who demonstrate the ability to take risks and profit by their entrepreneurial activity.    Additionally, capital-gains tax rates that are any higher than necessary to support needed government revenues will exact a much higher cost in lost productive entrepreneurial activity. As the penalty for earnings increases, profits decrease, and with decreased profits so declines the amount of effort and risk that entrepreneurs will expend as they choose more leisure activities, over less productive real output. Also tax penalties diffuse and distract real productive output at every level, because private and government sectors now will spend creative energy &quot;playing hide-and-seek&quot; with the remaining real earnings.    So the real risks in capital-gains tax levels are twofold. Unfair tax rates cause less revenue and increased expenses as investors shelter income and government expenses rise to ferret out fraudulent tax shelters. And more fundamentally, less entrepreneurial effort is offered when tax rates are too high, thus reducing the entire schedule of income earned by potential investors.    It should be recognized that productivity of entrepreneurial output is not only a fundamental element of a strong economy, but also of its investment sector as well. Then an equitable capital-gains tax rate can be tied not only to earnings, but also to the inherent risks taken to achieve them. Until then, arbitrary high capital-gains tax rates will be unfair to us all.    Mark Keller   Greenville, S.C.    ---   In his March 2 letter to the editor, Rep. Philip M. Crane (R., Ill.) evoked Benjamin Franklin's epigram that there are two certainties in life, death and taxes, and warned against combining the two in the case of taxation of capital gains at death. Rep. Crane is wrong in fully believing Mr. Franklin. To tax capital gains at death would only be to tax gains accumulated free of income tax during life.    Under current law, and contrary to Rep. Crane's assertion, Americans are not only not taxed &quot;every day of their lives&quot; on unrealized appreciation in their capital assets, but we are also not taxed on such gains when we die. Somewhere along the line capital gains should be taxed. Will Rogers was only partially correct when he observed that of life's two certainties, taxes are the only one for which we can get an automatic extension.    With regard to capital gains, the extension is in the form of a total forgiveness. This is so, even though such appreciation in the value of our assets increases our economic power and taxpaying capacity and hence our ability to pay our fair share. Income from labor is not so favored. Perhaps Calvin Trillin is right in suggesting that such a system reflects a national belief that speculation, given the recent market &quot;pixilation,&quot; is a more worthwhile way to make a living than working.    As to Rep. Crane's fear of a conception tax as next on the legislative agenda, he is too late -- we already have it. Raising children is a matter of personal choice paid for with pre-tax dollars. Such form of personal &quot;consumption&quot; does reduce one's taxpaying capacity, and Congress in partial recognition of this fact has provided for a personal exemption of $1,900 per dependent child for 1987. Any costs in raising children above that level are borne with pre-tax dollars -- a tax on conception carried to term and beyond.    The point is not whether we tax death or conception, but how we justly distribute the tax burden among ourselves. Death and birth, however polemically evoked, are only aspects of that measure, but not the measure itself.    Ljubomir Nacev   Associate Professor of Law   Salmon P.
