Exley Jr.andP;  NCRreduced their $125 price demand to $110 just prior to the meeting,but executives at ATandamp;T maintain that is still too high.andO;Indications are that both companies are now more willing tonegotiate a friendly merger rather than a hostile takeover, asthis would benefit ATandamp;T greatly in terms of year-end accountingoptions and allow the company to increase its offer to NCR.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   NCR Corp.
