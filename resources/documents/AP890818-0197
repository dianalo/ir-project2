The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index lastmonth matched the gain in June. Together, the two reprts showed themildest two-month inflation picture since July-August 1986 andmarked a sharp contrast to surging prices in the first five monthsof the year.   Even with the recent slowdown, prices for the first seven monthsof 1989 rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, more than a fullpercentage point higher than the 4.4 percent increases in both 1988and 1987.   The Labor Department said the most recent dampening of costpressures reflected drops in prices of gasoline and apparel,particularly women's clothing, and a moderate rise in food costs.   ``It's more good news,'' said economist Sandra Shaber of theFutures Group, a Washington consulting firm. ``The overall trend hasbeen that the economy is, in fact, achieving the soft landingeveryone was hoping for. In other words, growth is continuing butinflation is under control.''   In a separate report, the department said the moderation ininflation produced a 1.5 percent jump in Americans' average realearnings, to $338.01 a week. It was the largest advance sinceFebruary 1982 and followed a slight 0.1 percent gain in June.   In reaction to the inflation news, the stock market dippedslightly in early trading today. Analysts said traders believed theprice moderation was not dramatic enough to spur the Federal ReserveBoard into loosening credit anytime soon.   However, in Kennebunkport, Maine, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater said, ``We believe inflation is on a downward trend (and)... lower inflation should take the pressure off interest rates.''The administration has been pressuring the Fed not to choke offeconomic growth, which would sharply reduce tax revenue and inflatethe budget deficit.   Gasoline prices, after shooting up 21.2 percent in the first fivemonths of the year, fell 1.0 percent in June and dropped anadditional 2.2 percent in July, the sharpest decline since October1986.   However, fuel oil costs rose 1.5 percent last month, reversingJune's decline of 1.2 percent, and natural gas was up 0.5 percent.   Food and beverage costs rose a moderate 0.3 percent in Julyfollowing a 0.2 percent June gain. That was a moderation from thefirst five months of the year, when the lingering effects of lastyear's drought sent food prices up at a 9.3 percent annual rate.   Cereal products, beverages and sweets all rose substantially, butthey were offset by a 0.7 percent drop in the index for meats,poultry, fish and eggs.   Clothing costs were down 0.8 percent last month, following a 1.1percent decline in June. Prices for women's and girls' apparel fell2.0 percent and those for infants and toddlers dropped 4.8 percent.   The Labor Department attributed the declines to larger-than-usualend-of-the-season price discounts for women's clothing.   The price of goods and services other than food and energy rose0.4 percent, driven up by a 2.0 percent gain for tobacco butdampened by a 0.4 percent decline for new cars.   The various changes in July left the overall Consumer Price Indexat 124.4 percent of its 1982-84 base. That means a hypotheticalselection of goods costing $100 during the base period would havecost $124.40 in July, up 30 cents from June.   The moderation in consumer prices had been expected by economistsand was sure to be greeted as good news at the Federal ReserveBoard, which had been raising interest rates in order to slow theeconomy and cool inflationary pressures.   In June, the central bank reversed course and began pushinginterest rates down after spotting widespread evidence that theeconomy had softened. The recent good news on inflation is likely toconfirm analysts' belief that the Fed's decision to shift policy waswarranted.   Although inflation in the first six months of the year was theworst first-half performance since 1982, economists generally expectthe moderating trend of the last two months to continue.   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University, whoconducts his own independent price surveys, said, ``Our preliminaryprojections suggest that inflation may remain subdued in August ...(and) that when energy prices stabilize in the fall, consumer priceswill return to a 4 percent path.''   The Federal Reserve Board, according to a report to Congress byChairman Alan Greenspan last month, is a bit less optimistic thanprivate analysts, although it agrees that price increases willmoderate in the second half.   It is anticipating an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 5.5percent for 1989.   The Bush administration, in a forecast released last month,predicted an inflation rate of 5 percent for all of 1989 _ implyingan annual rate of about 4 percent from July through December _ and a1990 rate of 4.1 percent.   That was only slightly brighter than the consensus of 50 privateeconomists compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona,Ariz. It forecast a 5.1 percent increase in costs this year,followed by a 4.6 percent rise in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
