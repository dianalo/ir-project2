Transient and stationary properties of probabilisticautomata are linked to surface and bulk properties, respectively, ofrestricted statistical mechanical systems. It is demonstrated that methodsof statistical physics can be successfully used to describe the dynamicand the stationary behavior of such automata. Some exact results arederived, including duality transformations, exact mappings, disorder,and linear solutions. Many examples are worked out in detail to demonstratehow to use statistical physics in order to construct cellular automatawith desired properties. This approach is considered to be a first steptoward the design of fully parallel, probabilistic systems whose computationalabilities rely on the cooperative behavior of their components.</TEXT></DOC>
