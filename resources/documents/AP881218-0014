Also Sunday, Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who led thecountry to independence from Britain in 1970, was admitted to ahospital complaining of chest pains, doctors said.   The roadblocks were dismantled after a personal appeal from themilitary chief, Sitiveni Rabuka.   Australian Associated Press said Rabuka, leader of two militarycoups last year, made the appeal on national radio. Rabuka is aMethodist, like those who were protesting.   A spokesman for the demonstrators told Radio Fiji that Methodistsregard Sunday as a day of rest and for the family, not a day ofwork. He said the action was meant as a display of faith.   An almost total ban on Sunday activity, including organized sportand beach parties, was imposed soon after the second military coupas a result of strong lobbying by the Methodist Church, which isdominated by indigenous Fijians.   But since then a list of exemptions has grown.   Families are now allowed to picnic as well as plant and harvestvital sugar cane crops. Resumption of limited Sunday publictransport apparently infuriated some worshipers.   Church President Josateki Koroi said the protest did not have hisblessing.   AAP said several hundred Methodists manned about 70 roadblocksthat stopped cars and buses moving around the city and its outskirts.   State-owned Radio Fiji and privately run FM-96 radio bothreported that about a dozen roadblocks had been set up on suburbanand city streets as well as the highway linking Suva to its domesticairport, forcing the cancellation of flights by domestic carrierFiji Air.   A placard at one blockade read: ``Cars take a rest on Sunday.''   Mara, 68, whose defeat in elections last year led to Rabuka'sfirst coup, was admitted to the Colonial War Memorial Hospital inSuva. ``He was feeling unwell but has now recovered,'' a spokesmansaid. ``He has elected to stay in hospital and undergo medicaltests.''   Rabuka staged the South Pacific's first military takeover on May14, 1987 following the election of an Indian-dominated governmentheaded by Timoci Bavadra, who is Fijian. Bavadra defeated Mara, whohad served since 1970.   Indians outnumber ethnic Fijians among the 715,000 population.Rabuka said his coup was aimed at protecting the political rights ofethnic Fijians.   Rabuka staged a second coup in September 1987 when an interimadministration he had set up with Mara as its leader began draftinga constitution that Rabuka said did not protect ethnic rights.   Rabuka reappointed Mara again after the second coup.</TEXT></DOC>
