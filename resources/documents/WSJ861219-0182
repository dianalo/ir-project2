This summer, after being fired from his job as a recruiter for a Cleveland vocational school, Mr. Purvis sued his former employer. He charged the school with helping students to obtain fraudulently millions of dollars in federal financial aid.    The tool he used was a provision of the 123-year-old False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to sue employers on behalf of the government for what they consider fraud against Uncle Sam. Such suits have recently been filed against Northrop Corp., TRW Inc. and a number of other major defense contractors, alleging overcharges or other improprieties.    Coming in the wake of growing publicity about corporate fraud, these cases already represent renewed interest in the provision, which for decades had been largely ignored. And now Congress has strengthened the act, adding protections against corporate reprisals and raising both the rewards for individuals who bring successful suits and the liability for companies that lose them. As a result, lawyers and government officials expect the act to play an even greater role in combating fraud against the government.    While no one knows exactly how much such fraud costs taxpayers, Justice Department estimates range as high as $100 billion a year. &quot;There are all kinds of good cases out there just waiting to be made,&quot; says Assistant Attorney General William Weld. Sometimes, he adds, it takes a private lawsuit &quot;from out of the blue to uncover large-scale fraud&quot; and prompt federal action.    The revised act is likely to force companies to step up efforts to look into employee allegations. However, many lawyers and industry executives fear it might also spark a rash of frivolous, politically motivated lawsuits. The strengthened law &quot;allows anybody with a gripe or a beef or a good lawyer to file a claim, and to be protected and presumably get some of the money,&quot; says Ruben F. Mettler, chairman and chief executive of TRW, which is currently facing two fraud-related suits, one of them for $1.2 billion. Adds a Washington lawyer, &quot;Once someone gets some big bucks and becomes a millionaire, the floodgates will open.&quot;    The False Claims Act, often called the Abe Lincoln law, was originally intended to enlist the average taxpayer's help in reducing profiteering during the Civil War era. Over the years, it has been watered down by various court interpretations and certain portions largely became relics.    But several weeks ago, Congress added tougher fines and jail sentences for violators, as well as stiff penalties for reprisals. The employer is now liable to the employee for twice the amount of back pay and special damages if found guilty of retaliatory action. The act also protects witnesses who might otherwise be afraid to testify on behalf of the prosecution.    Moreover, Congress raised to 25% from 10% the maximum share private parties can receive for successful suits in which the government intervenes (it has 60 days to decide whether it wants to do so). If the government chooses not to participate, the plaintiff can receive up to 30%, with the rest still going into federal coffers.    While the effect of the changes on pending suits has yet to be determined, a look at some of those cases shows how the False Claims Act has been applied.    Consider Mr. Purvis's suit against Airco Technical Institute, one of 23 schools owned by Montvale, N.J.-based BOC Group Inc. The 30-year-old Mr. Purvis had been employed by Airco for just two weeks when he told his bosses about allegedly fraudulent student-loan applications. For complaining about the practice and for not participating, the suit claims, he was fired.    But Mr. Purvis wasn't dissuaded. Convinced that &quot;it was unfair that students were being ripped off while the school was making millions and millions of dollars,&quot; he sought legal counsel. He recalls being &quot;really surprised&quot; to learn of a federal law he could use to defend himself and also alert the government about alleged fraud. A month after his firing, Mr. Purvis filed a suit in Cleveland federal court in which the government later decided to take part.    Mr. Purvis's suit alleges, among other things, that the &quot;practice of causing students to submit false information in support of their applications&quot; for a variety of educational grants was &quot;coerced, directed, ordered and condoned by the managing personnel&quot; of BOC's adult and vocational schools, including Airco.    Airco referred queries about the matter to BOC; a spokeswoman there, who declines to comment on Mr. Purvis's firing, says, &quot;We don't believe his claims have any substance.&quot;    Whistle blowers have also used the law to make allegations about defective products and inadequate safety testing. A suit filed in Los Angeles federal court in October against Northrop by a former company engineer alleges in part that the aerospace and defense contractor &quot;knowingly manufactured defective parts&quot; for use in the guidance systems of MX missiles.    Northrop and the Pentagon deny that the missile program faces such problems. Northrop denies the allegations in the suit and maintains that the Air Force told the company that &quot;the system has met all of its reliability specifications.&quot; (The Air Force says that, while there may be some technical problems with the parts, it hasn't found evidence that they don't work.)    The Justice Department, which says it is waiting for additional material from the plaintiff, hasn't yet decided whether it will join the case, but some former Northrop officials say they have been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    Actions under the False Claims Act are certainly bolstered by federal backing, attorneys say. But joining a suit can be an immense burden for the government. One problem for the Justice Department is the 60-day deadline for deciding whether to intervene. Another is that complex fraud suits can take several years to litigate.    To analyze a suit filed in April against TRW -- in which former employees accused the company of conspiracy, price fixing and antitrust violations -- a half dozen Justice Department attorneys &quot;worked practically around the clock,&quot; says U.S. Attorney Patrick McLaughlin of Cleveland.    In the end, the government assumed control of the suit, narrowing it to allegations that one of TRW's units fraudulently misstated labor and material costs on subcontracts involving military aircraft parts and equipment. TRW has said that it believes the action to be &quot;without merit,&quot; and that it supports the government's involvement and expects &quot;vindication.&quot;    Negotiations are now under way to settle the suit. Mr. McLaughlin says he concluded that, despite the new legal weapons Congress has given him, litigation would take five to 10 years. &quot;You'd be crazy to fight it,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
