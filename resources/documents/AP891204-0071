The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that Helmsleyand the others may be sued under a federal anti-racketeering law.   Helmsley, his business partners and an engineering firm arebeing sued by tenants of the Parkchester apartment complex in theBronx in New York City. The lawsuit said the defendants concealedstructural defects in the buildings, the presence of asbestos ininsulation and the need to replace electrical systems and plumbing.   They are charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO).   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in January said thecharges against the defendants, if true, constitute a pattern ofracketeering activity as defined by the RICO statute.   The Supreme Court last July ordered the appeals court to restudythat decision after the justices themselves handed down a similarruling in a Minnesota telephone rates case.   The high court said the RICO act can apply to even a singlefraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing illegalactivities. The justices said the law may be invoked againstbusiness fraud, not only traditional forms of organized crime.   After re-examining the Parkchester case, the 2nd Circuit courtin September reaffirmed its original ruling and permitted the suit.   The suit is separate from a federal tax evasion criminal casethat resulted in the conviction of Helmsley's wife, Leona.   Harry Helmsley was found incompetent to stand trial on thecriminal charges in that case because of memory loss and reasoningproblems caused by several slight strokes.   The case acted on today is Helmsley vs. Beauford, 89-572.</TEXT></DOC>
