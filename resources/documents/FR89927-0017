The proposed rule was aDepartment of the Army deviation to Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement(DFARS) Subpart 245.3 and section 252.245. The deviation permits the Armyto provide existing Government property under installation support servicescontracts without retaining the responsibility for replacement. There isone change which is in placement of coverage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date:</T2> September 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">A. Background </ITAG>The proposed rule solicited comments from interested parties. Commentswere received from three sources. The following summarizes significantcomments, suggestions and actions taken.Time Limit Concern was expressed that two-year test means two years opportunity toinitiate contracts utilizing this mode of equipment provisioning. The deviationwill authorize use of the procedures in solicitations/contracts issuedduring the test period. Procedures will be applicable to the entire contractperiod, including option periods.Submission of Proposed Maintenance Plan It was suggested that the proposed maintenance plan be provided with contractorproposals, and the successful contractor's plan updated within 30 daysafter contract start versus receiving the proposed maintenance plan 45days after contract start. Agree, however, the proposed clause is referringto FAR 45.402, which requires the contractor's maintenance system to beapproved in writing by the property administrator. A contractor cannotdevelop a complete maintenance plan until after contract award. If thecontracting activity desires to have an outline of a proposed maintenanceplan for use with evaluation, this could/should be so stated in the Schedule.Inconsistent With General Contracting Principles Normally ``commingling'' of government and contractor materials is notallowed. If exercised, it will be necessary for the government's materialsto be properly marked and at Government expense. Nonconcur. DFARS 245.505-3allows commingling of materials so long as the contractor has adequatecontrols to ensure that the requirements of 242.7206 are met. FAR 45.506states that the ``contractor shall identify, mark, and record all Governmentproperty * * *'' Therefore, the deviation does not require any additionaleffort. Current practice is that contractors may invoice items costing under $1000as direct line item costs. When the contractor is reimbursed for such directline item costs, the government takes title. Agree, providing the contractstates that the government will reimburse the contractor as a direct lineitem cost, the government retains title (FAR 52.245-2(c)(4) and 52.245-5(c)(2)).However, the government property clauses do not contain a dollar thresholdregarding the government's responsibility for replacement. The practicereferenced in the comments is derived from DODI 4100.33, Commercial ActivitiesProgram Procedures. This procedure is not incorporated in FAR contractingpolicy. Material, as defined in FAR 45.302, can be provided at the beginningof the contract, with a statement that the contractor will be responsiblefor replacement. Under the proposed deviation procedures, the governmentwill not retain title of any items for which the contractor is responsiblefor replacement, regardless of cost. Concern was expressed that no mention was made in the procedures regardingaward or incentive fees to be applied to contractor replacements or provisioning.Unless otherwise waived, award and incentive fees are considered applicableto costs for contractor replacement of government property. This is notapplicable to the procedures. Basic award and target incentive fees arenegotiated and determined prior to award of the contract. This fee is basedon the total estimated contract cost. The fee does not change when thecontractor procures a replacement item. No change is necessary becauseacquisition of replacement items will be an allowable contract cost. Thebasic award fee and target incentive fee does not change. Concern was expressed that the government would pay more than necessaryfor replacement equipment if the contractor requires more for the itemthan indicated in the cost proposal. No change is necessary as the contractingofficer has the authority to challenge the contractor's cost under FAR31.301-3. It was suggested that there should be greater detailed data on differentiationbetween different types of equipment and material being provided whichare expected to be replaced by the contractor. No change is necessary asthe proposed 5145.301 defines ``Other Property and Special Use Property.''FAR 45.301 defines ``Material.'' It is up to the command to determine whichitems should be considered under ``other property'' or ``special use property''and/or what items of material the government should be responsible forreplacing.Stockage Levels and Reorder PointsIt was suggested that volume discounts be encouraged as long as excessivevolumes would not accrue and if contractors do not utilize government supplysystems, what stockage levels and reorder points would be allowed or requiredfor replacement operations. This is not applicable as a responsible contractorwill establish stockage points, etc. If the contracting activity desiresto know the contractor's procurement mechanisms for replacement operationsfor evaluation purposes, they should request that information as a partof the proposal. A request for the contractor's proposed plans for replacementoperations for evaluation of offers is an in-house decision.  <T3>Mission Capability  </T3>Concern was expressed that procedure affords incumbent contractor an ``edge''over other competing contractors and the Government at resolicitation time.The government could not compete again without repurchasing many itemsof equipment which is a problem in support of readiness training, testingand actual mobilization. No change is required as equipment required forreadiness training, testing and actual mobilization should be determinedto be ``Special Use Property'' for which the government will retain title. Concern was expressed that if the contractor defaults or the Governmentelects to not exercise an option the installation could not support requiredmissions. The government should have the right to purchase contractor equipment.No change is necessary as FAR 10.010 provides procedures for acquisitionof used or reconditioned government property. which includes equipment. <T3>Commercial Activities In-House Costing  </T3>Concern was expressed that there were no specific procedures to explainin-housing costing needs for this mode of operation. No change is necessaryas guidance regarding preparation of the government cost estimate is providedby U.S. Army Organization of Efficiency Review Activity.  <T3>Clause Subject Matter  </T3>The title of 5145.302-6, Required Government Property Clauses for FacilitiesContracts, is incorrect. The subject matter does not involve facilitiescontracts. Agree. The referenced paragraph has been revised to read 5145.302-3(S-91)Required Government Property Clauses for Other than Facilities Contracts. <ITAG tagnum="84"><T2>B.
