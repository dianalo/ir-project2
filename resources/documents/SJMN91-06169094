It extends thelimitations far beyond the one year previously allowed between an allegedmolestation or a victim's recollection of the incident, said the plaintiffs'attorney.;    The new law extends the statute of limitations so that a victimcan sue anytime before the age of 26, or beyond the age of 26 within threeyears of realizing that psychological injuries suffered as an adult werecaused by earlier sexual abuse.;    In the suit, Maura Daly, Kit Fouts andAndrea Moore, all former students at the Alternative School program at thenow-closed Cubberley High School, allege that teacher Tommy Derrick fondledthem and in two cases, persuaded them to orally copulate him. Daly was 15,Fouts almost 15 and Moore 16 when the alleged molestations took place in 1977and 1978.;    According to the appeals court ruling citing the originallawsuit, the following occurred:;    Two years after the alleged incidents,Daly and several others met with three school district teachers and Derrick todiscuss the situation. The teachers asked the girls to talk about what hadhappened. But because Derrick was present, the girls were too embarrassed andintimidated to go into detail. Fouts said she had been made to feel more thanuncomfortable by Derrick, but was not asked to elaborate. At the end of themeeting, the teachers offered a solution: If the girls would never bring upthe subject again, Derrick would resign from Cubberley, according to thelawsuit.;    Some years later, Daly began a romantic relationship with a youngman who disclosed to her that he had been sexually abused as a child andassociated that history with some problems he was having. Daly began to thinkher experience with Derrick might have had a similar effect, and in November1986, she began to consult a therapist.;    By March 1987, she had begun torealize &quot;how painful and damaging&quot; her relationship with Derrick had been forher, the lawsuit stated.;    The other two schoolmates, who were contacted byDaly's mother in June 1987 to help her try to get Derrick's teachingcredential revoked, also sought counseling, according to the lawsuit.;    Thesuit, filed in September 1987, was initially dismissed based on case law thatprevented suits from being filed when a molestation had not been repressed andthe victim did not realize until much later what the long-term psychologicalinjury had been.;    The young women appealed the case, and this most recentruling, although not reversing the earlier case law, puts a new interpretationon it, said the women's lawyer, Mary R. Williams.;    &quot;If you show you did notunderstand that the defendant was doing something wrong to you; that it wastheir fault and not yours, you can still state 'delayed discovery' andqualify,&quot; Williams said. &quot;The key here is that the (young women) did notunderstand their injuries and that what he did was a wrong on his part.&quot;;   The consortium supported that view, as did other child abuse interest groupsthat joined the appeal, including the California Child, Youth and FamilyCoalition.;    &quot;The reality is that often abuse is perpetrated againstchildren and young people by people in authority, often very cruelly, and itcompletely misuses the power these people have over children,&quot; Crissy said.;   &quot;It gets buried in the memory. The whole attempt to allow delayed discoveryis an attempt to acknowledge how often these children think they've donesomething wrong. Improved therapy techniques have made it possible for thosememories to be brought back and to get some redress for a terrible wrong doneseveral years before.&quot;;    Derrick resigned his teaching credential after thesuit was filed. But his attorney would not discuss his current whereabouts oroccupation. &quot;Those kinds of things are information that if they get out intothe public, could not only affect the case but could affect Mr. Derrickpersonally and our attorney-client relationship,&quot; said attorney GordonFenwall.;    If the case goes against Derrick at trial, said Fenwall, he maynot be able to get his insurance to pay any monetary damages a jury mayaward.;    The company that carries his homeowners insurance policy recentlyasked the court for protection against the suit, claiming that molestation isintentional, not accidental, and therefore would not be covered under hispolicy.;    The three teachers named in the suit as negligent in the reportingof the alleged molestations left the district on good terms and started theirown school, said their attorney, Margaret E. O'Donnell.;    The teachers denyany knowledge of physical contact between Derrick and the students, andthought the students were uncomfortable only with language Derrick used in hisclasses, O'Donnell said.;    The ruling can be appealed to the state SupremeCourt, but neither Derrick nor the teachers have made a decision on thatissue, according to some of the attorneys.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  S.L.
