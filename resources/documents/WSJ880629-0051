Tokyo shares continued to slump.    The Financial Times 100-Share Index rose 15.4 points to 1856.9. The narrower 30-share indicator rose 9.3 to 1477.4. Volume was 386.7 million shares, compared with 390.7 million a day earlier.    London stocks opened sharply lower following Monday's 29.8-point decline and slides overnight on Wall Street and in Tokyo. But the losses narrowed through the morning, and stocks moved into gains after the midday boost in British base rates to 9.5% and Wall Street's higher opening Tuesday. The turnabout &quot;underlines the fact that there is still cash out there and people are buying shares with it,&quot; said Peter Meinertzhagen, head of sales at Security Pacific Corp.'s Hoare Govett unit.    The interest-rate increase was expected -- in fact, many traders had thought a full point increase to 10% was possible -- following Monday's news of a record British trade deficit in May. But traders Tuesday were divided about the prospects about further increases.    Racal eased 5 pence to 340 pence ($5.78). Earlier Tuesday, the U.K. electronics manufacturer reported that up to 25% of the equity of its telecommunications unit will be offered to the public as part of a previously announced floating of the business, scheduled for early October. Dealers said there was some disappointment that the company didn't release more details on the public offering.    Berisford, a food and commodity merchant, rose 6 pence to 351. Earlier Tuesday the company said it had a 10.3% rise in pretax profit for its fiscal first half ended March 31, in line with market expectations. Ranks Hovis McDougall rose 19 pence to 402, its intraday high. Traders said market talk continued to circulate that Australian-based Goodman Fielder Ltd. was either attempting to sell its 29.9% stake in the food manufacturer or looking to increase its stake.    Legal andamp; General, a life insurer, rose 13 pence to 321. Dealers said shares rose on rumors of another possible buyer of a substantial amount of the company. General Accident, a composite insurer, gained 14 pence to 894.    Blue Circle gained 14 pence to 435 on the belief the company was about to increase cement prices, which it did after the market closed. Other cement makers had announced price rises in the last week.    Ready Mixed Concrete rose 7 pence to 477.    In Tokyo, investors waited for a clearer picture of movements in the foreign exchange markets.    After losing more than 250 points in the morning session, the Nikkei index recovered to close the day down 36.92 points at 27398.09. The index recouped about 220 points, however, from its intraday low of 27177.54.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were firmer. The Nikkei index stood at 27515.99, up 117.90 points.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange first-section index, which fell 6.97 points Monday, bounced back 2.78 points to close at 2158.48 Tuesday. Volume was estimated at 2.5 billion shares, nearly three times the 850 million shares that changed hands Monday.    Institutional investors who came into the market after the morning decline and bought large capitalization issues, mostly steel companies, were responsible for steering the market back up, analysts said.    Traders said most of the heavy industrials managed to post hefty gains, along with some heavy electricals. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries surged 50 yen, or 6.1%, to close at 865 yen ($6.45). Kawasaki Heavy Industries was up 50 yen to 575. Kawasaki is one the large-capital issues that isn't included in the Nikkei index. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) was up 28 yen to 865, while Mitsui Engineering andamp; Shipbuilding rose 24 yen to 416.    Among major steels, Nippon Steel surged 40 yen, or 9.4%, to close at 615, on volume of 301.4 million shares, making it the most heavily traded steel. Kawasaki Steel gained 33 yen to 673 on volume of 242.5 million shares, while NKK (Nippon Kokan) rose 20 yen to 584 on volume of 234.7 million shares. Kobe Steel gained 30 yen to 569, while Sumitomo Metal Industries was 39 yen higher at 560.    Volume in these five steels came to around 1.16 billion shares, or about half of the volume on the first section.    Traders said the electricals that managed gains Tuesday were mostly those priced under 1000 yen. Toshiba rose 45 yen to 930, while Mitsubishi Electric was down 10 yen to 2450 and Oki Electric Industry rose 18 yen to 911.    In Frankfurt, prices dropped amid interest-rate fears and a declining dollar, brokers said.    Brokers said the sell-off was motivated by growing conviction that the Deutsche Bundesbank will increase its discount rate, currently at a historic low of 2.5%, on Thursday. The rate rise may also be accompanied by a lift in short-term money market rates, brokers said.    The decline in share prices Tuesday came despite a recovery in bond prices that fixed-income traders said was caused by short-covering. Share prices were down generally by less than 3 marks ($1.65) a share, although losses were bigger among auto and retailer stocks.    Daimler-Benz was 10.50 marks lower at 633 marks ($347.58). Bayerische Motoren Werke was down 8 marks to 505.50, while Volkswagen slipped a mark to 260.50.    Among chemicals, Bayer dropped 3 marks to 277, while BASF eased 2.70 marks to 247.50, and Hoechst slipped 2.30 marks to 262.20. Schering declined 1.80 marks to 510.    In the electrical sector, Siemens dropped 3.60 marks to 401.50. AEG dropped 0.20 mark to 200.40.    Retailer Karstadt eased 6 marks to 428, while Horten was down 3 marks to 186. In the machinery sector, Linde was down 5.50 marks to 683.50.    Share prices fell in other major European markets, except Amsterdam, where they finished mixed. In Pacific markets, prices were down in Sydney, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei and Manila, and were mixed in Wellington and higher in Singapore.
