The bill was approved on a voice vote and sent to the Senate,which was expected to approve it and send it to the White Housebefore adjourning for the year.   A centerpiece of the measure was $125 million in military aid _including weapons and police training _ to Bolivia, Colombia andPeru for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The aid is intended forunits organized specifically for narcotics control, and can be usedso long as police forces do not commit gross human rightsviolations.   Another major feature was authorization of $115 million foroperations of international narcotics control programs through theState Department. It continued the requirement that countries becertified as cooperating fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts beforereceiving aid.   Under the bill, U.S. officials may help in training foreignanti-drug personnel and may accompany them on forays but are barredfrom direct involvement in arrests in foreign countries.   House and Senate negotiators, at the insistence of Sen. RobertByrd, D-W.Va., dropped from the bill authority to use some moneyfor non-Andean countries that are major drug transit points. Thatmeant that $2.5 million in weaponry and $1 million in policetraining would be lost to Mexico, Ecuador, Paraguay, Brazil,Jamaica and the Bahamas.   Another change gave more flexibility to the administration toreward new drug eradication or interdiction efforts in Peru,Bolivia and Colombia, by waiving repayment of official debts owedto the U.S. government.</TEXT></DOC>
