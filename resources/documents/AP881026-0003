Mike Haller, a spokesman for the Alaska National Guard. ``Theylooked good all afternoon. To look at them, you'd have thought theyhad their bags packed and were ready to head south.''   ``They're in the main lead, and I can't help but think they'llkeep on truckin'. I don't know how much more we can do,'' saidrescue coordinator Ron Morris of the U.S. National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration.   The work to free the migrating California gray whales progressedrapidly Tuesday when two Soviet ice-breaking vessels began smashingthe ice that kept the pair imprisoned. A third trapped whale isbelieved to have died last week.   Morris, who followed the whales by helicopter, landed a littleafter 4 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT) to report that the whales had moved fromthe final man-made breathing hole to the slushy path the Sovieticebreaker Vladimir Arseniev cut Tuesday night.   Rescue officials were worried that the whales would have troublebreaking air holes through the partly frozen cut, but around 4:30p.m. rescue workers found the two whales had opened a smallbreathing hole and were sharing it.   One of the whales was bleeding enough to stain the water red.   Spectators watched anxiously for several moments, waiting for thewhales to surface in the new waterway cut Wednesday by the Arseniev_ and cheered joyously when the whales broke the surface.   As darkness fell, the whales were swimming back and forth in thechannel. Officials halted helicopter surveillance at nightfall, butsaid they planned to meet Thursday and could check whether thewhales had reached the sea.   The Arseniev stayed in the channel Wednesday night, widening thepassage to the open sea, officials said.   Scientists and others involved in the rescue may never know thewhales' fate. ``A lot of people really didn't want to know,'' saidJim Harvey, a federal marine biologist, after officials decided notto put electronic tracking tags on the already stressed animals.   Haller said plans were being made in Barrow to thank the Sovietswith a party, but Soviet officers said they would wait until it wasclear the whales were in the open sea before celebrating.   Before the whales were freed, as the Soviet icebreakers drewnear, the whales were ``acting in a very excited manner, almost likethey can sense freedom,'' said Sgt. Ian Robertson, an AlaskaNational Guard spokesman.   By midday, the Soviet icebreakers were a quarter-mile from theline of breathing holes being cut by Americans working in theopposite direction, he said.   Later Wednesday, rescuers began to use a gargantuan, tractor-likedevice propelled by pontoon augers to clear the ice cut by theicebreaker, Robertson said.   The breakthrough in the effort to free the migrating gray whalescaught in an early freeze came after more than a week of delays anddisappointments.   ``We feel very good about it,'' said Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersenof NOAA. ``The cooperation has just been fantastic. The Soviets camein here with a very positive attitude and went to work immediately.''   On Tuesday, the Americans moved the huge mammals around a shoalthat had stymied progress for three days. Eskimos with chain sawscut a detour in the ice so the whales could swim around the shallowwater they had refused to pass.   When the Eskimos started cutting the air holes, the whales``followed the water right to the end. They like that deeperwater,'' Petersen said.   Working in the other direction, the Soviet icebreakers reduced torubble the ice ridge standing between the whales and open water. Theridge, formed by colliding ice masses, was a jumble of ice blocks asbig as small houses.   ``The whales seemed to be doing fine,'' Petersen said. ``It'slike they expected something to be happening. Everything seems to becoming together.''   The whales, which normally migrate to the Southern Californiacoast in the winter, were discovered off Alaska's northern coastthree weeks ago, the ice closing in around them and leaving themonly a few small breathing holes.   The whales could not swim the four miles to open water withoutsurfacing for air. A third whale disappeared Friday and is believeddead.   The icebreakers _ the Admiral Makarov and the Arseniev _ beganworking shortly after their arrival Tuesday, flying the flags of theSoviet Union and the United States as a sign of cooperation betweenthe nations.   The ships had been returning to their home port of Vladivostokwhen they were diverted, said Alexander Patzevich, chief officer andsecond in command.   Although the Admiral Makarov has been at sea for six months and``everybody is tired,'' none of the crew of 78 has complained aboutthe diversion, Patzevich said.   ``It's very nice to work together,'' he said of the U.S.-Sovieteffort.   First Mate Vladimir Moroz, who said he was the ship's politicalofficer, said the Soviets were happy to help. He said he spoke to aMoscow newspaper by telephone.   ``They're receiving many, many calls asking about the whales,''he said. ``Our country is watching like everyone else. We loveanimals, just as everyone.''   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen toabout 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for thepast decade, officials said.   The whales have one of the longest migration routes of all themammals, some 6,000 to 8,000 miles from the Arctic to the warm wateroff Baja California.   ``The human persistence and determination by so many individualson behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern for theenvironment,'' President Reagan said from the White House. ``It hasbeen an inspiring endeavor.''</TEXT></DOC>
