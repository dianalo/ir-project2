(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy on Saturday launched its newestTrident nuclear submarine, the $1.2 billion USS Pennsylvania. About100 anti-nuclear activists protested and six were arrested.   The 560-foot long submarine is the second ballistic missilesubmarine equipped to carry the Trident 2 missile, which is intendedto have a range of up to 4,000 miles and accuracy of within 200yards.   ``Fleet ballistic missile submarines, and particularly ourTrident submarines and the men who take them to sea, are the heartand soul of our deterrent,'' Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett IIItold a crowd of about 1,000 at the commissioning. The sub will bebased in Kings Bay, Ga.   About a quarter of a mile from the ceremony, members of theenvironmental and anti-nuclear group Greenpeace formed a flotilla of10 small boats in the Thames River. Several protesters floated in awooden replica of the yellow submarine made famous by the Beatles. Afour-piece band on a sailboat played ``Anchors Aweigh'' and ``YellowSubmarine.''   ``We're committed to the cancellation of the Trident program.Even though we make light of the Pennsylvania, it's the taxpayers'money that's being wasted,'' said Shannon Fagan, a Greepeaceorganizer.   Six protesters in three inflatable rafts deliberately crossedbarriers the Coast Guard had set up about 50 yards from thesubmarine. One of the rafts reached the submarine, and protesterswere trying to affix an anti-nuclear flag to its side when CoastGuard boats arrived with New London police aboard.   Coast Guardsmen sprayed the protesters briefly with watercannons. No one was injured. The six demonstrators were arrested andcharged with criminal trespass and reckless operation of a motorvessel. They were released after posting bond.</TEXT></DOC>
