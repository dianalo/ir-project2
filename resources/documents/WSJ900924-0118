The conflict became evident during a hearing of thecongressional Joint Economic Committee about theadministration's handling of two controversial export-licenseapplications.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. policy &quot;is in disarray,&quot; said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D.,N.M.). He complained that the policy currently is set by a&quot;hodgepodge&quot; of agencies.   In one case discussed during the hearing, the U.S. firstauthorized Brazil to obtain special heat treatment for sevenrocket casings, but then reversed itself and prohibitedsimilar treatment for 11 other casings. Heat treatment is aprocess of hardening rocket parts to make them more resistantto the stresses of re-entry into the atmosphere.   The State Department initially gave the state-managedBrazilian Aeronautical Commission a license to obtain theheat-treatment services because it saw no risk that the partswould be transferred to a potential war zone. But theadministration altered its position after the Pentagoncomplained. The Pentagon, which didn't participate in theoriginal decision, argued that the treatment could giveBrazil the capability to build vertical-launch rockets withpotential military applications.   The Chicago firm that provided the treatment, LindbergCorp., earlier said in a statement that it had been assuredby the Brazilian licensee that the casings would be used onlyfor space research and wouldn't be resold to any other party.   In another case, the administration indicated that it ispreparing to act on a long-delayed application byInternational Business Machines Corp. to enhance the power ofan IBM 3090 Model 200 computer installed at Embraer, aBrazilian aeronautical firm. There has been considerabledebate over whether the technology could be used in missiledevelopment programs.   A senior administration official said the sale could beapproved if Brazil guarantees the technology won't bediverted to unauthorized uses.   But Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project onNuclear Arms Control, warned the congressional panel that theIBM sale poses a risk of diversion because of the presence inBrazilian aeronautical circles of &quot;high-tech mercenaries&quot; whocould share supercomputing knowledge with Iraq.   IBM said its proposed sale of two additionaldata-processing units for the computer would be accompaniedby an airtight &quot;government-to-government agreement&quot; onsecuring the beefed-up machine.   International concern about missile proliferation has beenintensified by the faceoff between Iraq and the U.S. and itsallies in the Persian Gulf. Despite Washington's ownagonizing experience with such licenses, it is urging itsallies to retain or tighten their own controls on the exportof missile and chemical-warfare technology, even if there nolonger are restrictions on shipment of the technology to theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe. James LeMunyon, deputyassistant secretary of commerce for export administration,said the appeal will be cabled to 16 allied governments soon.   In 1987, the U.S. and some of its allies organized aninformal arrangement called the Missile Technology ControlRegime, but the venture is handicapped by the lack of aspecific, up-to-date list of controlled items. Moreover, thegroup, which includes West Germany, Canada, France, Italy,Britain and Japan, has no ability to control exports fromnewly industrializing countries like Taiwan and South Korea.   A U.S. proposal could affect shipments to as many as 36countries believed to be developing missile-manufacturingskills. U.S. officials cautioned, however, that it won't beeasy to secure agreement on which products to control andwhich destinations to proscribe. &quot;Some of these countries areour friends,&quot; said Henry Sokolski, a Pentagon aide in chargeof non-proliferation policy.   A State Department official said the U.S. will try toprevail upon Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello torespect U.S. non-proliferation concerns. Mr. Collor isscheduled to address the United Nations General Assemblytoday.</TEXT></DOC>
