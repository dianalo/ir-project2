As part of a review of the BS nuclearengineering degree program at the University of Virginia, the authorssurveyed several local utilities with operating nuclear plants abouttheir needs for nuclear engineering graduates. The perception of manyof the utility executives about a nuclear engineering degree and abouta nuclear option in another engineering curriculum does not agree withthe way the authors view these two degrees. The responses to two of thesurvey questions were of particular interest: (1) does your company havea preference between nuclear engineering graduates and graduates in otherfields with a nuclear option? (2) what do you consider to be a minimumlevel of education in nuclear engineering for a nuclear option in mechanicalengineering? All of the four utilities that were surveyed stated a preferencefor mechanical or electrical engineers with a nuclear option, althoughtwo indicated that there are certain jobs for which a nuclear engineeringgraduate is desired.</TEXT></DOC>
