Michel Aoun to accept anArab League-sponsored peace plan. They also urged kidnappersholding Western hostages to free the men.   Democratic Reps. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio and Nick Rahall of WestVirginia, both of Lebanese descent, arrived in Lebanon on Saturdayand held a three-hour meeting with Aoun in the bunker of theshell-shattered presidential palace in Baabda.   The announced reason for the trip was to discuss with Aoun thepeace accord approved a week ago by a special session of theLebanese Parliament in Taif, Saudi Arabia. It would shift politicalpower to the Moslem majority and clear the way for election of apresident.   Aoun has rejected the accord for not setting a timetable for thewithdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and refuses to acceptresults of an election held in Syrian-controlled territory.   The State Department told the politicians their lives could bein danger in Lebanon, where eight American hostages are held. Thehostage held longest, Terry Anderson, passed his fifth birthday incaptivity Friday.   ``While our State Department does not approve of this trip ofours. ... they did state that they did not mind us coming andspeaking with Gen. Aoun,'' said Rahall.   Ms. Oakar said Aoun agreed with much of the peace plan, ``butthere's some missing link,'' she said, without elaborating.   Thousands of Aoun supporters met the two representatives at thepalace, carrying placards that read: ``The U.S. administrationsupports the Taif conspiracy against free people'' and ``We needsupport and not intelligence compounds,'' an apparent reference tothe U.S. Embassy that closed last month.   In an address to the throng, Aoun said he would not honorpresidential elections outside Lebanon's Christian enclave.   ``Any president elected outside Lebanon will be president forthose who elected him and any president elected in (Syrian)occupied Lebanese territory will be sa urrogate of theirs, but onlythe one elected here will become president for all Lebanon,'' hesaid, referring to the enclave north of Beirut that is controlledby his army.   Aoun's stance on the elections complicates efforts to arrangefor balloting within the period proposed by an Arab Leaguemediation committee, which is no later than Nov. 7.   Aoun did not say whether he would reject an election held in theno-man's land of Beirut's dividing Green Line, which is controlledby neither his troops nor the Syrians and which houses the currentParliament.   Rahall also announced that efforts are under way to reopen theAmerican Embassy in Beirut.   ``We want to return our ambassador and reopen our embassy inthis country and that's the first visible step of showing (our)commitment,'' said Rahall.   Washington pulled Ambassador John McCarthy and 29 otherdiplomats from east Beirut on Sept. 6 after Aoun accused the UnitedStates of supporting the presence of 40,000 Syrian troops inLebanon, who were deployed in 1976 to quell the civil war.   The general has accused the United States of selling Lebanon toSyria out of fear for the lives of the Americans held hostage inLebanon.   After speaking with Aoun, the Americans crossed into Moslem westBeirut, where they held talks with acting Prime Minister SalimHoss, who heads a Moslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's.   Ms. Oakar paid special tribute to Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who marked his 42ndbirthday in captivity Friday. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   ``I want to make a special plea for Terry and the others if Ican,'' she said. ``We call on anybody that has any influence uponthe hostage takers to release them.''   There are a total of 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
