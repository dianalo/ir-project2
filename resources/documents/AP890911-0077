It was one of the bloodiest days of the 21-month Palestinianuprising against Israeli rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and WestBank.   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops today killed two guerrillasin a clash, the second gun battle there in three days, Lebanesesecurity sources reported.   They said two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the firefight nearthe village of Kfar Kila in Israel's self-designated ``securityzone.''   An Israeli army spokeswoman in Jerusalem confirmed the clash butsaid only three soldiers were wounded and one guerrilla was captured.   The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a loose coalition ofpro-Syrian leftist and Palestinian guerrillas, claimedresponsibility for the shootout in a statement that gave no otherdetails.   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, meanwhile, said he thought aproposal by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak could be the basis foropening talks with Israel on Middle East peace. Peres is head of theleft-leaning Labor Party.   His stand will likely heighten debate in Israel on Mubarak's plansince Labor's coalition partner in the government, the right-wingLikud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, is opposed to theEgyptian proposal.   The victim of the army raid in the West Bank, identified asZuhair Abdul Halim, 28, was found dead under a tree in the villageof Kafr Quddum with gunshot wounds in the neck and stomach, Arabreporters said.   Residents of Kafr Quddum said Abdul Halim apparently was killedin yesterday's clash in which another villager also died and sixwere wounded.   Villagers said Kafr Quddum was raided by about 10 men in civiliancloths, but the army issued a statement saying an army patrol openedfire in the village when it was attacked by Palestinians youthsduring an arrest raid.   The army spokesman's office said it was checking the report of asecond death.   Abdul Halim's death was the seventh reported in scattered clashesSunday. It was the highest one-day toll since May 19, when eightPalestinians were shot and killed in a series of clashes withsoldiers.   The heaviest day of casualties in the uprising occurred on April16, 1988, when 18 Palestinians were shot and killed in riots thatfollowed the assassination in Tunis of PLO military commander KhalilWazir, better known as Abu Jihad.   Abdul Halim's death raised to 567 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israelis in the uprising. Forty Israelis also have died inthe violence.   In other violence, the body of a Palestinian suspected ofcollaborating with Israeli authorities was found in an orange grovein the Gaza Strip.   The death raised to 113 the number of Palestinians slain byfellow Arabs during the uprising as accused collaborators,prostitutes or drug dealers.   Arab hospital officials said five Palestinians were wounded inclashes with Israeli troops today, including a 17-year-old youthfrom the West Bank village of Tamoun in critical condition with abullet in the back.   The latest discussion on the stalled Middle East peace processconcerns Mubarak's proposal designed to get Palestinian backing forIsrael's call for elections in the occupied territories.   His 10-point peace plan includes Israeli acceptance of theU.S.-backed concept of trading land for peace and allowing the140,000 Arabs of east Jerusalem to vote in the elections Israel isproposing to choose Palestinian negotiators.   A Lebanese security source said today's 90-minute border clashbroke out after the guerrillas had infiltrated the Israeli-occupiedarea one mile west of the Israeli border, ``possibly with theintention of attacking an Israeli post there when they werespotted.''   The source, who requested anonymity, said about 120 Israelisoldiers backed by 20 armored personnel carriers and tanks and twohelicopters later carried out a search operation around Kfar Kilafor more guerrillas.   Israel carved out the six- to 10-mile-deep border zone when itwithdrew the bulk of its army in 1985 after a three-year occupationof south Lebanon.   The zone, patrolled by Israeli troops and militia allies, servesas a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israelisettlements.</TEXT></DOC>
