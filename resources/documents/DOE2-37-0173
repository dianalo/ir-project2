Small or middle scale hydraulic power generation inJapan is in prospect since there are many locations and no removal compensationproblems. The development of geothermal one lags behind in Japan sincemost of the site are located in the national parks, however, a geothermalgeneration capacity reaches 7,000MW in the world, and application studiesof hot water separated from steam and hot dry rock are also promoted.Many studies of solar thermal one are promoted in Europe and United States,however, solar cells have many unsolved problems such as large scalecombination, power leveling or cost benefit. Wind power one is higherin a technical level, so that cost reducing and more practical uses areexpected. Wave power and tidal current one are under development, Japanhas a few technical lead in ocean thermal one, and a tidal one capacityreaches 240MW in France. Although the natural energy is renewable orunlimited and almost pollution-free, many problems for the improvementof a cost benefit are remained for future studies.
