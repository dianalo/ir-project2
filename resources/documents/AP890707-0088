(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The father of two former PTL aidestestified in their tax-evasion trial that they gave him and his wifea Cadillac, jewelry and furs, and trips to Paris, New York andNorthern Ireland.   David and James Taggart, friends of PTL founder Jim Bakker, arecharged with failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to1987.   Federal prosecutors say they diverted $1.1 million of ministryfunds to their personal use by taking cash advances on PTL creditcards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card bills.   Henry Taggart's testimony established that the claims of familywealth recalled by his sons' co-workers at PTL were false.   ``Let me put this to rest once and for all,'' Henry Taggart said.``I do not and never did own seven Cadillac dealerships.   ``I did not and never did own one Cadillac dealership. I workedfor a Cadillac dealer. That's it.''   Today, an attorney hired by PTL to fight an effort by theInternal Revenue Service to revoke the ministry's tax-exempt statustestified that he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cashadvances and American Express charges that dealt specifically withDavid Taggart.   Michael Wigton, a former IRS specialist in exempt organizationswho is now in private practice, was retained by PTL in late 1985 tofight the IRS's proposed revocation of PTL's tax-exempt status. TheIRS action stemmed from an audit of PTL of the years 1981-1983.   In other testimony Thursday, PTL tax attorney Robert Gunsttestified that David Taggart bought $100,000 worth of jewelry and$400,000 in other purchases the same year he told the IRS histaxable income was $107,000.   ``Did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase itemsworth $500,000 when his income was $100,000?'' prosecutor DavidBrown asked.   ``It looks like a mistake was made,'' said Gunst, who preparedTaggart's 1984 tax return.   Other purchases questioned Thursday included a one-bedroomapartment on the 57th floor of New York's Trump Tower, which Gunstsaid the two brothers bought in 1986 for $640,000.   Gunst also said that Bakker approved using ministry funds to pay$52,000 in back taxes and penalties levied against David Taggartfollowing an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax returns.   Gunst said he found 25 to 30 boxes of credit card receipts duringan IRS audit of the ministry, and was worried that spending by theTaggart brothers could threaten PTL's tax-exempt status.   ``The receipts were there,'' Gunst said. ``The issue was whetherthere was substantiation.''   ``I told him the importance of keeping good records,'' Gunstsaid. ``I don't know if he was the main problem. It looked to methat he had provided the documents to support his travel.''   Both Taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists.Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, had become Bakker's top aideand James Taggart, 35, was the ministry's interior designer. Bothwere fired after Bakker resigned in 1987 amid a sex and moneyscandal.   If convicted, they each could face 25 years in prison and finesof more than $1 million.   In his testimony today, Wigton described one incident in which hewas unable to get his hands on American Express receipts. A set ofcopies he requested from the credit card company was lost at PTL. Asecond set of copies also was reported lost by PTL officials, hesaid.   ``They just disappeared,'' said Wigton.   Most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses andother charges incurred by David Taggart, he said. Without therecords, Wigton said, his effort to fight the proposed IRS actionwas ``hampered significantly.''   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Ben Cotten, Wigtonacknowledged that other records were also missing.</TEXT></DOC>
