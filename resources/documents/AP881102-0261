Many expected education issues to loom large in this race, andthere was even a candidates' debate last fall devoted solely to thetopic.   But the only education issue that really caught on in thiscampaign was one that the next president will have no say over:whether public school teachers should be compelled to lead thePledge of Allegiance at the start of each school day.   Bush made political hay over Dukakis' 1977 veto of a mandatorypledge bill that the Mernor thought wasunconstitutional.   Educators remain confident that regardless of who winsassachusettsgov, the nextpresident will not propose the massive cuts in school aid andsupport for college students that Ronald Reagan sought.   But they say neither Bush nor Dukakis has done enough todramatize the problems facing American schools or spelled out aconvincing plan to improve performance.   Bush, the Republican, tells voters wherever he goes that betterschools are the key to a better future for America.   Dukakis, the Democrat backed by both teachers' unions, valued and honored profession again.''   Education ``faded as a central issue,'' said Ernest L. Boyer,president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.   ``We hear strong inspirational statements ... but the directionthe `education president' would take is still not clear,'' he said.   Richard Berendzen, president of The American University inWashington, said both candidates deserve ``a D-plus'' on education.   Berendzen said 25 percent of American youths drop out of highschool and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the United Statesoften pulls up the rear on international scholastic tests.   ``If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that thepreparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing America,'' saidBerendzen.   Despite the generalities, said College Board President Donald M.Stewart, ``It is obvious both candidates are making the link betweeneconomic productivity and international competitiveness and theunderserved, undereducated poor.''   Dennis Doyle, a Hudson Institute scholar, said it is inevitablethat education will slip to the back of the president's agenda.   ``Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president willactually keep, as apart from a campaign list,'' said Doyle. ``Thedeficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, evenhealth care, Social Security, transportation and housing all arehigher on their priority list.''   While American business leaders ``have themselves in an absolutelather about education'' and there is ``an enormous reservoir ofpublic interest'' in the schools, Doyle said, ``it's hard to imaginewhat kind of federal role you would craft given all the otherdemands on the president's time and on the budget.''   Both have outlined ways to help families cope with the soaringcosts of college _ Bush with a tax-free savings bond plan, andDukakis with a new loan program that students would repay throughpayroll deductions.   Bush, whose administration tried to cut $5 billion from theEducation Department last year, actually has proposed biggerspending increases than his rival.   Here are their major education proposals:</TEXT><HEAD>BUSH</HEAD><TEXT>   _ $500 million for a ``Merit Schools'' program that would rewardschools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students.Schools would get up to $100,000 each to spend as they saw fit.   _ $50 million for matching grants to create more ``magnet''schools that emphasize various academic subjects.   _ Expanding from $12 million to $50 million a proposed Fund forInnovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $1million for an experimental district trying such concepts asparental choice, merit pay or year-round schools.   _ Funds for Head Start, the $1.2 billion pre-school program fordisadvantaged children, would be increased by $250 million and up to$1 billion over four years. Bush said he is commited to buildingHead Start ``to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attendclasses.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 children nowin Head Start are only 16 percent of those eligible. Bush wants toadd places for 350,000 4-year-olds.   Bush has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $4.6 billionremedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible poorstudents.   Congress recently passed legislation that makes good on anotherBush campaign promise: tax-free interest on U.S. Savings Bonds forcollege tuition, starting in 1990. The tax break would be phased outfor couples with adjusted gross incomes between $60,000 and $90,000,and for single parents between $40,000 and $55,000.   Bush also would spend $100 million to support youth service andvolunteer activities.</TEXT><HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>   _ $250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund to providecollege scholarships and forgive loans for those who becometeachers, launch a new National Teacher Corps, create state teacherretraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and a fivefoldexpansion of a $1.9 million Christa McAuliffe Fellowship program fortalented teachers.   _ $25 million for a ``Citizens Literacy Corps'' to supportvolunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read.   _ A ``Student Tuition and Repayment System'' (STARS) that wouldallow students to pay back college loans through payroll deductionsin their working years. It would supplement, not replace, existingfederal grant and loan programs, at least at the start.   Students would obtain the STARS loans from banks, but thegovernment would collect the payroll taxes to replenish the loanfunds. Dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighthto one-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $1,000borrowed, meaning a tax of 2.5 percent to 5 percent for a $20,000borrower.   The rate stays the same for low- and high-income earners. The taxwould be applied on income up to the level taxed by Social Security(currently $45,000). The Dukakis plan would allow borrowers to buyout their loan commitment at any time.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
