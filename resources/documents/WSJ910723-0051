The grain, harvested in July, totaled 98.2 million metrictons, off only 1.9% from 1990's record level. A report lastweek estimated at least 10 million tons, or 10% of theaverage summer harvest, had been wiped out. Since mid-June,rains have flooded 18 provinces and damaged 39.5 millionacres along the Yangtze River.   Though foreign agriculture specialists are skeptical,Beijing didn't lower its grain output target of 425 milliontons for this year. In the rainy season through August,further downpours could threaten the autumn grain crop, whichaccounts for 80% of the country's annual output.   Despite the floods and industries' debts, China said itseconomy in the first half grew 6.1% from a year earlier, whengross national product logged only 2.1% growth. But Beijingwarned serious problems, including inflation and inefficientstate-run industries, still threaten growth.                                                                                                          ASEAN DEFIANT AT TRADE TALKS                                                                                                          The European Community said human rights, democracy andthe environment must be addressed in its ties with theAssociation of South East Asian Nations, which opened ameeting in Kuala Lumpur with its major trading partners. ButASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, thePhilippines, Singapore and Thailand -- said no group shouldimpose its standards on others or try to make them conditionsfor trade and investment. The EC accounts for 15%, or about$20 billion, of ASEAN's annual exports.                                                                                                          BRAZIL'S TIFF WITH THE IMF                                                                                                          Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello asked theInternational Monetary Fund to recall Jose Fajgenbaum, thehead of its negotiating team in Brazil. He said Mr.Fajgenbaum's remark that Brazil needs to revamp itsconstitution to achieve structural reforms intrudes indomestic affairs. The Argentine-born Mr. Fajgenbaum said hewas misinterpreted. Mr. Collor agrees the constitution needschanges, but this could be complicated if it appears to bedictated by the IMF.                                                                                                          JAPANESE FIRMS' SPENDING PLANS                                                                                                          Japanese companies are cutting back on capital spending inNorth America, where the U.S. recession has made increasedinvestments unattractive, a Japanese newspaper survey found.In the year ending next March 31, 208 Japanese units in theU.S. and Canada plan to cut equipment and plant investments17% to $1.77 billion from a year earlier; last year, capitalspending fell 2.6%.                                                                                                          SINGAPORE'S GOAL FOR INVESTING                                                                                                          To overcome a labor shortage, Singapore is urgingcompanies to invest overseas, a U.S. Embassy report said. Thelabor situation's pressure on pay could push up the Singaporedollar's value, hurting exports. Singaporeans have investedmore than $1 billion in Indonesia. Bilateral deals, forexample, allow Singapore firms to move labor-intensiveoperations to Indonesia, where wages are low, and keepmanagement functions at home. Singaporeans also have investedabout $1 billion in the U.S. since 1988.                                                                                                          CANADA SEEKS DEDUCTIONS CURB                                                                                                          Ottawa issued draft legislation designed to preventbusiness borrowers from claiming tax deductions for interestpayments that effectively represent repayment of debtprincipal. This follows relatively new long-term debtobligations in which a large amount is paid back in the earlyyears in prepayments of later years' interest costs, but ineffect represent repayments of principal, Canada said.Borrowers try to claim tax deductions for both principalcosts and interest charges. Based on current law, the taxtreatment of these debts is uncertain.                                                                                                          EC COMPROMISES ON PRODUCTS                                                                                                          European Community ministers compromised on measures aimedat building the barrier-free EC market after 1992 in drugproducts and food, ending long-running wrangles on issuesranging from drug advertising to artificial sweeteners.   On pharmaceuticals, the ministers agreed to ban generalads for prescription medicines and to set standards on adsaimed at the medical profession. They agreed to ban &quot;abusive,frightening or misleading&quot; ads for over-the-countermedicines. A political accord on measures for labeling andmarketing drugs allows varying national systems such asnon-prescription medicine sales in general stores orpharmacies.   A preliminary accord sets out rules on sweeteners, andlists foods, from potato chips to German beer, in which theymay be used.   The EC Commission opened a copyright-enforcement inquiryinto alleged pirating in Thailand of EC-registeredrecordings. It said bootleg Thai recordings have costcompanies and musicians in the EC member nations $233.8million in the past 10 years.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Iraq now can pump oil at about two-fifths of its pre-GulfWar level, making about one million barrels a day availablefor export, the Middle East Economic Survey said. But aUnited Nations report said restoring Iraq's oil installationswould take two years and cost $6 billion. . . .
