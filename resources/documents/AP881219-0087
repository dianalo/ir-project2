The General Accounting Office, the investigative and auditingagency of Congress, said foreign acquisitions as a share of alltakeovers has increased from 6 percent in 1984 to 9 percent lastyear to 13 percent in the first half of this year.   However, of the 1,281 foreign takeovers during the 4{-yearperiod, only 17 were hostile, or resisted by the target company'sboard of directors, the GAO said in a letter to Rep. Byron L.Dorgan, D-N.D.   Dorgan, a member of the tax-writing House Ways and MeansCommittee who has proposed tax measures designed to curb hostiletakeovers, said in an interview Monday that he is concerned by boththe increase in hostile mergers generally and by increasing foreigninvestment in the United States.   The steady rise until last year of the U.S. trade deficit has putmore dollars in the hands of foreigners, who have in turn spent themon investments in the United States.   Much of the foreign investment has been in real estate andgovernment securities, but Dorgan said the GAO's figures indicatethat foreigners also are buying up U.S. corporations.   ``I think that raises some general policy questions that Congresshas to address. ... If you have broad foreign ownership of Americanassets, the question is, Who are Americans working for? Where is theincome stream from those assets directed?'' Dorgan said.   Other economic observers, among them Federal Reserve BoardChairman Alan Greenspan, say foreign investment can be seen as avote of confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. They pointout that foreign investment in American firms creates jobs for U.S.citizens.   Between 1984 and mid-1988, there were 25 attempted hostiletakeovers by foreigners, and 17 of them were successful. Thatcompares with a total of 77 hostile takeovers out of 191 attempts.   Dorgan said the relative success rates _ 68 percent for foreignhostile bids versus 40 percent for contested bids generally _indicate that foreign tax laws or some difference in regulation maygive foreign bidders an advantage over U.S. bidders.   British firms accounted for eight of the 17 foreign unfriendlymergers. Three were by Canadian companies, two by French firms andone each by Dutch, Japanese, Swedish and Swiss investors.</TEXT></DOC>
