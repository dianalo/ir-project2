The merger apparently will leave Vons with the financial and corporate structure of Detroit-based Allied, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.    Effectively, the merger allows El Monte, Calif.-based Vons to go public without offering shares, and lets Allied go private without having to make an offer to acquire shares from its holders.    Vons said in a statement that Vons holders would receive $132.1 million in cash from Allied and 13.3 million Allied common shares. Vons also said the transaction includes the assumption of debt, but didn't say how much debt or to which company the debt belonged.    An earlier merger agreement -- announced in September but canceled the following month -- called for the new company to assume $440 million of Vons debt. Subsequently, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. had placed Allied debt on its CreditWatch list with negative implications, saying the merged company's debt, as a percentage of capital, would be a &quot;very high&quot; 80% to 85%.    At the time, Allied said it had $120 million of cash, $93 million of which it raised through an offering of debentures and common stock in May. The offerings were handled by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The earlier agreement didn't include a sale of assets. When that agreement was canceled, executives of the two companies said they couldn't agree on numerous issues.    Allied's chairman, David K. Page, and its president, Lon D. Makanoff, who were to be executives in the merged company that was part of the September agreement, are leading the management group that will take Allied's operations private. Vons said the group will pay $46 million in cash and debt, plus the assumption of more than $20 million of liabilities. Allied's operations include 23 supermarkets, a wholesale grocery company and one drugstore.    Messrs. Page and Makanoff couldn't be reached for comment. Donald Gapp, controller of Allied, said he didn't have any knowledge of the transaction because he had been out of the office for several days.    Vons was itself taken private in a leveraged buyout last January. The buyout group included the Bass Investment Limited Partnership, which is an investment vehicle of the Bass brothers in Fort Worth, Texas. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets.    Vons said it would form a new company that would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company would have headquarters in El Monte and retain the Vons name. Vons said its chairman, Roger E. Stangeland, will be chairman of the new company, and Vons's president, William S. Davila, will be president of the new company.    In an interview, Mr. Davila said the company has been eager to return to publicly held status &quot;to grow and get added value to the stock.&quot; Company executives, he said, decided that a merger would be &quot;a more convenient way to do it&quot; than a public offering.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Allied closed at $7.125, down 12.5 cents, on volume of 47,700 shares.    In its fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 18, Allied had net income of $586,000, or four cents a share, which included a special credit of $270,000. That compared with year-earlier net of $2.7 million, or 12 cents a share, including a credit of $1.2 million. Sales rose 9.2% to $123.2 million.    Vons had 1986 revenue of nearly $3 billion and has about 18,000 employees. Allied had 1986 revenue of $386 million and has about 1,900 employees.    Vons said Warburg, Pincus Associates, a New York investment firm that currently holds 28% of Allied shares, would be the largest holder in the new company, with a 14% stake.    Vons said the transaction is subject to regulatory clearance, obtaining the necessary financing and approval of both company's holders. </TEXT></DOC>
