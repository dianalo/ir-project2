But critics found freshammunition to charge that the special census failed to do its job.   Census workers, many of them homeless themselves, enduredgunfire, robbery, insults and foul weather to count the number ofAmericans with no fixed address. Past guesses have ranged from250,000 to 3 million.   The results won't be announced until late 1991, and the debateover the census will continue until then and beyond. It was framedagain Wednesday by two men on opposite sides of the country.   ``It's just the people in their ivory tower drinking their mintjuleps and counting noses,'' said George Whitney, a resident ofBaloney Joe's shelter in Portland, Ore. ``Nobody can help thehomeless because nobody understands the problem.   In New York, Dwayne Mays stood up for the census, in which heparticipated both as a counter and as one of the counted. He, too,is homeless.   ``Hopefully, it will let people realize there is a wholepopulation of homeless people that is not dehumanized, stillmaintains self-respect and self-esteem, that is living inconditions that are abhorrent,'' Mays said. ``We're here, and weare counted now.''   Not all the homeless were counted, though, even by the CensusBureau's assessment. In some cases, homeless people avoided thecensus takers; in others, they were apparently overlooked.   In Manchester, N.H., census takers failed to count a man who wassleeping on the steps of City Hall _ he was outside their surveyarea.   In San Diego County, Calif., a group of farmworkers in a migrantcamp said a team of Census ``enumerators'' walked past them withoutstopping to count.   In New York City, reporters watched Census workers mill around anewsstand on the ground floor of the Port Authority bus terminal,apparently avoiding the upper floors where hundreds of homelesssleep. Census officials insisted they had canvassed the entirestation.   The Census Bureau spent $2.7 million on the homeless count,which it carried out between 6 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday inevery city with a population over 50,000.   In several cities, Census workers said homeless people hadvanished from their usual spots, apparently to avoid the government.   ``That tells us something,'' said Don Weese, manager of theCensus Bureau office in Tulsa, Okla. ``It tells us there's a largesegment of that homeless population that simply does not want to berecognized, known or encountered at all.''   Still, the officials defended their effort and said it wouldprovide a valuable ``snapshot'' of the state of the homeless.   The issue is politically important because federal money goes tocities and states on the basis of population. Urban leaders havebeen fuming for a decade, saying the Census Bureau ignored most ofthe homeless in the 1980 census.   ``Shelter and Street Night appears to have been a success,''Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant said. ``I believe our effortshave given us a good start on achieving our goal of a full and faircensus of the American people.''   Ms. Bryant conceded that Census workers had missed some sheltersand other homeless hangouts, and would have to try again Wednesdaynight in a handful of cities. They included Washington, New York,Philadelphia and Cleveland.   Critics found nothing in the tally to change their view.   ``You can't use this census with any degree of legitimacy,''said Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless in Washington.``Politicians can use these figures to say anything that they want... because there's no way that you can legitimately count how manyhomeless people that are in this city or in this country.''   For the most part, the census was carried out as planned. Therewere some frightening moments, however.   In New York City, a group of Census workers scattered when agunshot was fired from a building they were approaching inBrooklyn. They weren't injured, and Census officials said it wasn'tclear whether they were the targets.   In Oklahoma City, police turned back two Census workers whounwittingly stumbled onto a stakeout.   ``They were just told the bad guys are loose, and it wasn'tpursuant to what those two were doing, and to take a hike,'' saidJohn Prince, a local Census official.   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., two Census workers were robbed atknifepoint by a man in a homeless shelter. Neither was injured.   The mishaps underscored the unenviable nature of the task. Ms.Bryant, the Census director, said she hoped the first homelesscensus also would be the last.   ``I hope that the numbers we got last night and thecharacteristics of the people we found will provide the informationthat program planners need to solve this problem,'' she said. ``Ourgoal is not to be out there in the year 2000.''</TEXT></DOC>
