Moody's said its forecast for Calgary, Alberta-based GulfCanada, which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,reflects the company's high interest charges and preferreddividend costs, a poor outlook for its drilling operations,and falling domestic oil output.</LP><TEXT>   The ratings downgrade, which Moody's said affects about900 million Canadian dollars (US$774.4 million) of debtsecurities, follows an announcement last month by the agencythat it had placed Gulf Canada under review for a possibleratings cut.   Moody's said its downgrade affects Gulf Canada's seniordebentures, lowered to Baa-1 from single-A-2; Series 1preferred shares, cut to Baa-2 from single-A-3; and a GulfCanada shelf registration, reduced to (provisional) Baa-1from (provisional) single-A-2. Moody's also lowered GulfCanada's commercial paper rating to Prime-2 from Prime-1.   The agency said it expects Gulf Canada's ability tocomfortably service debt to &quot;remain constrained over the nextseveral years&quot; because of dividend requirements. As a result,it said, &quot;capital spending is likely to outpace net cash flowgeneration, leading to increased financial leverage&quot; withoutan equity infusion or asset sales.   A Gulf Canada spokesman said, &quot;We're disappointednaturally, but that's their assessment. What else can I say?&quot;   Moody's said it sees Gulf Canada's longer-term prospectsas sound in light of its big reserves in frontier areas, suchas the Beaufort Sea and off the east coast of Newfoundland.It said Gulf Canada has also made &quot;significant progress&quot; inextending its exploration prospects in Indonesia, where itgained a major foothold with its 1988 acquisition of AsameraInc.   Moody's said this should help offset the company'sshrinking output from conventional fields in western Canada.   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Gulf Canada common stock closed at $13, unchanged.   Moody's said it also downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1its rating on about C$160 million of short-term debt ofOlympia andamp; York (Gulf Canada Square) Ltd., a unit of Olympia andamp;York Developments Ltd., the Reichmann family's wholly ownedflagship real estate concern.   The unit was formed to issue notes secured by thecorporate headquarters of Gulf Canada. A Moody's analyst saidthe downgrade of the unit's debt doesn't affect ratings onthe debt of Olympia andamp; York Developments or any of its otherunits.   Moody's said the rating cut, which followed a similarratings downgrade last month by Canada's Dominion Bond RatingService Ltd., was &quot;prompted by the fact that the company'sability to meet its obligations depends largely on thereceipt of lease payments&quot; from Gulf Canada, whose debtratings have been downgraded.</TEXT></DOC>
