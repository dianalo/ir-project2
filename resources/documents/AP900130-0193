(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man investigated in the mail bombslayings last month of a federal judge and a civil rights attorneygave samples of his blood, saliva and hair to the FBI on Tuesday.   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, accompanied by his attorney, was takenby police to a hospital, where he spent 45 minutes providingsamples requested in a federal grand jury subpoena issued last week.   Emerging from the hospital, O'Ferrell said he was happy tocomply with the subpoena and told reporters he has cooperated withthe investigation since the FBI arrived in this southeast Alabamacity on Jan. 22.   His attorney, Paul Harden, said the FBI did not tell him whatthey planned to do with the samples.   O'Ferrell, a 46-year-old Enterprise junk dealer, has beenquestioned extensively in the FBI's investigation of the slayingsof 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance ofBirmingham and Robert Robinson, an NAACP attorney from Savannah, Ga.   Similar package bombs were discovered and defused at the 11thCircuit courthouse in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., chapterof the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.   Agents have confiscated typewriters from O'Ferrell. Federalsources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the printingon the bomber's letters matched that on a 1988 letter O'Ferrellwrote to the 11th Circuit concerning a case he lost before thecourt.   Agents last week searched O'Ferrell's home and business andpumped out his septic tanks looking for evidence. The FBI hasrefused to say whether it found any clues, but dozens of agentsremain in southeast Alabama.   In another development, a pipe bomb mailed to a church inHouston exploded Tuesday morning, injuring Lisa Osteen, the30-year-old daughter of the pastor, the Rev. John Osteen.   Charles B. Kearney, an FBI spokesman in Houston, said there didnot appear to be any similarities between the Texas bomb and theDecember mail bombs.   However, O'Ferrell and Harden said the Houston bombing shoulddemonstrate that O'Ferrell had nothing to do with any of theattacks.   ``It's a sad state of affairs, but it does in my mind show WayneO'Ferrell, who has been in Enterprise since day one, is in no way,shape or form involved,'' Harden said.</TEXT></DOC>
