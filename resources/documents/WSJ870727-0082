National negotiations for 350,000 workers are scheduled to begin today at General Motors Corp. Bargaining affecting 104,000 Ford Motor Co. workers is to start tomorrow. The companies also are holding talks with their 200 union locals on work rules and other plant-specific issues. Their current three-year pacts expire Sept. 14. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract runs until next year.    In the traditional exchange of pre-bargaining rhetoric, UAW President Owen F. Bieber said the sessions are &quot;perhaps the most difficult and most important in the history of the UAW . . . . Our members are contributing significantly to the domestic auto industry's gains in quality and productivity, and they are entitled to know they have a future in the industry.&quot;    GM Chairman Roger B. Smith reiterated the common corporate position that true job security can come only from cutting costs. &quot;We will again focus on the continuing need to enhance our cost competitiveness by improving quality and productivity,&quot; he said.    Since the last negotiations, salaried employees at both GM and Ford have lost their cost-of-living adjustments, and GM is cutting its white-collar work force. The companies now will try to instill the same sense of cost-cutting urgency in their blue-collar work forces.    But Ford in particular will have problems pleading poverty. Last year it earned a record $3.3 billion, making a higher profit than GM for the first time in 62 years. This year, Ford has nearly matched that figure in six months alone.    The union traditionally concentrates on negotiating an agreement with one &quot;target&quot; company first, then tries to secure a similar pact at the other company. The current consensus among analysts is that Ford is the likely target, because a strike would cost it valuable momentum and its profit might allow a richer settlement.    But many union officials believe that if they want to confront the job-security issue, they must confront the struggling GM. The No. 1 auto maker last week reported that second-quarter operating income dropped 47%, that its share of the market among domestic producers slipped in mid-July and that slow sales forced it to add nearly 3,000 workers to the 40,000 already on indefinite layoff. </TEXT></DOC>
