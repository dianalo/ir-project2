These ambient nitrates and sulfates are nitric acid andsulfuric acid, and their partially or completely neutralized salts withammonia. The concentrations of these aerosol species are generally determinedby collecting filter samples, typically over periods of 24 hours or longer.However, the chemical composition of the aerosol may change significanton a much shorter time scale. For example, the occurrence of acidic sulfateshas been observed to be episodic in nature, such episodes typically lastingonly a few hours. Nitric acid and ammonium nitrate are relatively volatilespecies. When filter samples are collected over long periods, the nitratesin the sample are more likely to be a reflection of the ambient aerosolat or near the end of the sampling period than of the integrated aerosolduring the entire sampling period. Thus if the occurrence of nitrateis also episodic, the 24-hour filter samples may either miss such episodesif they occur early in the sampling period, or highlight them if theyoccur at the end of the sampling period. It is therefore important toexamine the aerosol with a much finer time resolution than samples over24 hours or more.</TEXT></DOC>
