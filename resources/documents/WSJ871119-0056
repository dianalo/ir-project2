The committees found no firm evidence that Mr. Reagan knew of the transfer of U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to Nicaraguan insurgents in 1986, but concluded that those who ran the operation from within the White House &quot;believed with certainty that they were carrying out the president's policies.&quot;    &quot;If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have,&quot; read the majority opinion signed by 18 of the 26 committee members and released yesterday. &quot;The idea of monarchy was rejected here 200 years ago and since then the law -- not any official or ideology -- has been paramount.&quot;    In a lengthy dissent, eight Republicans sought to play down the controversy. But Warren Rudman, vice chairman of the Senate committee, dismissed the minority views as &quot;pathetic.&quot; &quot;This is not a Democratic report; I am not a Democrat,&quot; the New Hampshire Republican said bluntly. &quot;The minority believes Republicans don't want the truth laid out.&quot;    The very bulk and tone of the 690-page report mirror the complexity and bitterness of the controversy the committees began investigating 10 months ago. House Democrats are still seeking data from White House computer files, and the report not only documents the damage to the president, but is written to bolster Congress's demands for a greater voice in foreign policy.    Opinion polls indicate the public long ago reached a judgment on the Iran-Contra affair, but the report's significance is enhanced at a time when the president has suffered political setbacks at home and faces important decisions internationally.    The president appears to have lost control of events in Central America, as only this week, the administration has been in a sharp dispute with House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) over his role in negotiating with Nicaragua. And the president is scheduled early next month to meet with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Washington.    &quot;The president did not violate any laws, even the majority does not so state,&quot; said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who sought to treat the report as more a passing event than a cause for alarm. &quot;It does culminate the long summer of self-examination for America and for the administration,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we are through it.&quot;    The report gives no ground to pressure from the administration to shrink and combine the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Instead, it recommends legislation to require the executive to make more timely and complete notice of covert operations to Congress. Within the administration, all authorizations of covert activity would be reviewed by the attorney general and an independent, statutory inspector general established to oversee the Central Intelligence Agency.    The majority concluded that the &quot;letter and spirit&quot; of the Boland amendment were violated and criticized &quot;the aura of disingenuousness&quot; surrounding White House arguments that Congress acted unconstitutionally in imposing this restriction on U.S. aid to Nicaraguan insurgents. The committees acknowledged that the law changed as votes shifted in the House and Senate, but they pointed to uncertainty as well within the administration over its policy in support of the guerrillas.    The report reveals that as early as July 1982, Donald Gregg, then head of the National Security Council's Intelligence Directorate, warned that the CIA was exceeding its authority under a finding signed the previous year. When Congress capped funding in late 1983, the administration sought to &quot;bring the Nicaragua situation to a head,&quot; according to previously classified documents, and instead of negotiations and arms interdiction, the focus was on military action against the Sandinista government.    Among American military commanders, the policy was viewed with uncertainty, and Army Gen. Paul Gorman, commander then of the Southern Command, told investigators that his pessimism about the resistance forces wasn't welcomed within the NSC staff. &quot;He saw me as a problem,&quot; the general said of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who came to coordinate a private network from the White House funneling arms to the insurgents in 1985 and 1986. &quot;I think he was just doing his damnedest to get me to shut up -- old General put a cork in it.&quot;    Within the White House, the committees concluded, Col. North had at least the &quot;tacit support&quot; of former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and performed with the expressed approval of Mr. McFarlane's successor, Rear Adm. John Poindexter. The late CIA Director William Casey is portrayed as promoting the concept of what became &quot;an extralegal covert organization&quot; financed from the arms sale profits.    The report also provides the most detailed account yet of a private fund-raising network that benefited from federal contracts and access to the president in raising an estimated $4.5 million, which was spent on the Contra cause in the U.S. and abroad.    In an aside, the committees record a wealthy Texan's plan to have Americans donate used shotguns to the insurgents. But for conservative operatives, the target was dollars. A Washington public-relations firm that held contracts from the government and assisted in the network was portrayed as &quot;the White House outside the White House.&quot; Col. North moved easily in these circles, even going with his family to stay at a wealthy contributor's home in Connecticut.    Col. North is described as using his position to obtain end-user certificates needed to import weapons into Central America on the Contras' behalf, and the report cited a plan in which a third party -- said to be an official within a Central American government, according to investigative sources -- offered to engage in sabatoge inside Nicaragua last year.    Before it ended abruptly with the shooting down of a supply plane in October 1986, the covert network completed as many as 110 flights in Honduras and over Nicaragua in support of the insurgents. The report said that many of the flights were helped &quot;informally&quot; by CIA field officers on the ground, preparing flight plans and intelligence as well as providing minor supplies for mechanics.    The report details how the president's obsessions with sustaining the Contras and freeing the hostages led his administration into a succession of amateurish, disastrous encounters with the Iranians, who outnegotiated Col. North and his associates at every turn.    &quot;Too many drivers -- and never the right ones -- steering in too many different directions took the Iran initiative down the road to failure,&quot; the report said.    &quot;The Iran initiative succeeded only in replacing three American hostages with another three, arming Iran with 2,004 TOWs and more than 200 vital spare parts for Hawk missile batteries, improperly generating funds for the Contras and other covert activities (although far less than Mr. North believed), producing profits for the Hakim-Secord Enterprise that in fact belonged to the U.S. taxpayers, leading certain NSC and CIA personnel to deceive representatives of their own government, undermining U.S. credibility in the eyes of the world, damaging relations between the executive and the Congress, and engulfing the president in one of the worst credibility crises of any administration in U.S. history,&quot; the congressional committees concluded. Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord managed the private arms network that supplied weapons to Iran and the Contras.    Mr. Reagan and his aides repeatedly have insisted that they were trying to strengthen moderate forces in Iran, an account pushed by Israeli and Iranian officials and middlemen. But the report reveals that some U.S. anti-tank missiles actually were delivered to the radical Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, a close ally of the Lebanese terrorists holding American hostages. It also said American officials were told that one of the &quot;moderates&quot; they were negotiating with had helped plan the 1984 kidnapping of William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut.    Although the secret Iran arms sales failed to win the release of all the American hostages in Lebanon and the Iranians kept raising the price of the hostages' freedom, Col. North continued selling arms to Iran partly to raise money for the Contras, the report said.    The first diversion of Iran arms profits to the Nicaraguan insurgents, congressional investigators concluded, took place when Col. North ordered $800,000, obtained from a November 1985 sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, transferred to a secret Swiss bank account used to buy arms for the Contras.    The report also reveals that, according to handwritten notes of an Israeli official, Col. North discussed using Iran arms proceeds to finance the Nicaraguan insurgency at a meeting with Israeli officials in New York on Dec. 6, 1985, a month before President Reagan secretly approved U.S. arms sales to Iran.    Col. North testified under oath that the idea of diverting arms profits to the Contras was first suggested by Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar in a bathroom conversation during a lull in a Jan. 22, 1986, meeting in London with U.S. and Israeli representatives. But the report reveals that surreptitious tape recordings of the meeting made by the CIA indicate that Mr. Ghorbanifar discussed such a diversion openly with Col. North, Israeli counterterrorism official Amiram Nir, and Gen. Secord.    According to the report, Mr. Ghorbanifar said laughingly: &quot;I think this is now, Ollie (Col. North), the best chance because we would never have such a good time, we never get such good money out of this. We do everything. We do hostages free of charge; we do all terrorists free of charge; Central America for you free of charge; American business free of charge; (a visit to the U.S. by an Iranian official). Everything free.&quot;    According to the report, Col. North, who knew the CIA was recording the proceedings, responded: &quot;I would like to see . . . some point this, uh, idea, and maybe, y'know, if there is some future opportunity for Central America.&quot;    The report also concluded that a &quot;second channel&quot; Gen. Secord found into the Iranian government in 1986 represented the same Iranian officials, including members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, that Mr. Ghorbanifar represented. Nevertheless, the report reveals that secret CIA tape recordings of U.S.-Iranian meetings show the new contact, a young nephew of Iranian parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, managed to extract a host of concessions from Col. North and his associates.    The recordings indicate that Col. North agreed to sell offensive weapons to Iran, substantially reduced the price of TOW missiles, made up fanciful stories of imaginary meetings with President Reagan, and agreed to develop a plan to win the release of 17 convicted Shiite terrorists jailed in Kuwait, although that directly contradicted the administration's policy of encouraging the Kuwaitis to stand up to terrorism.    If Col. North frequently lied to the Iranians, to his colleagues, and to the Congress, the report said, Mr. Casey doctored, misrepresented, and ignored his own agency's analysis in order to support administration policies.    For example, the report said, at a meeting on Jan. 9, 1986, Mr. Casey ignored a CIA assessment that the Contras had &quot;adequate weapons and ammunition&quot; and instead argued that the insurgents would &quot;go down the drain&quot; if the U.S. didn't &quot;go all out to support them.&quot; Mr. Casey also ordered his subordinates to exaggerate the importance of Sandinista military incursions into Honduras and misled the president about two Central American leaders' support for the Contras, the report reveals.    The report also discloses some details about how Col. North, apparently acting with Mr. Casey's blessing, used the proceeds of the Iran arms sales to finance other secret projects with the Israelis, Gen. Secord and the Drug Enforcement Agency.    Among other things, the report said, Col. North and Mr. Nir, the Israeli counterterrorism adviser, tried to create an armed force in Lebanon that could challenge Iranian-backed Shiite terrorists and try to win the release of the American hostages. According to other sources, Col. North and his associates sought to recruit members of Lebanon's Druze community as well as Israeli-backed Christian militiamen.    The report hinted that Col. North's ambitions extended well beyond Lebanon. &quot;Other projects contemplated by North involved aiding anti-communist resistance groups around the world,&quot; it said, citing Col. North's testimony that he and Mr. Casey sought to create a privately financed enterprise that could undertake secret operations on behalf of the U.S. government without congressional scrutiny.    Although the report doesn't specify what operations Col. North had in mind, Gen. Secord has said that he and the colonel discussed using Iran arms profits to aid anti-communist guerrillas in Angola, but that no such plan was ever carried out.    The report shows that White House officials lied among themselves -- Adm. Poindexter is even alleged to have leaked a story about Col. North to the press -- but the stronger undercurrent is the tension with Congress. The committees go back to previously classified transcripts and notes of House and Senate Intelligence Committee meetings to demonstrate a record of misleading statements that is most damaging to Mr. McFarlane.    The former national security adviser initially withheld information regarding substantial contributions by Saudi Arabia to the Contras as late as last December, and further denied then that he knew of Gen. Secord's role in the Contra supply operation. Similarly, the report shows Mr. Casey obscured the CIA's role in seeking foreign donations for the insurgents in 1984, and the late director sat by silently when a high-level State Department official next to him mistakenly claimed the administration wasn't pursuing such assistance.    ---                   Committee Recommendations   -- That Congress be notified before the start of a covertoperation and within 48 hours of a &quot;finding,&quot; or presidentialapproval for a covert operation   -- That the attorney general review all findings   -- That the NSC not engage in covert operations   -- That the CIA have an inspector general confirmed by theSenate to be used for internal investigations   -- That Congress have the right to ask for theforeign-bank records of U.S. citizens   -- That a presidential finding can't be used to supersedethe law   -- That contempt statutes be reviewed to allow Congress tocompel witnesses to testify and to produce documents   -- That the president's national security adviser be acivilian and that a limit be set on the tour of a militaryofficer assigned to the NSC staff</TEXT></DOC>
