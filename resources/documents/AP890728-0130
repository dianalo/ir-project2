The governing Liberal Democratic party, whose president becomesprime minister due to a comfortable majority in lower house,decided Friday to choose a new leader Aug. 8 and seek his approvalin Parliament Aug. 10, party officials said.   Ryutaro Hashimoto, who at 51 is the youngest secretary generalof the Liberal Democratic Party and is in charge of finding areplacement for Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, has said little abouthis possible candidacy.   On Friday, however, former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru,75, who had been viewed as opposing Hashimoto, said he had nointention to be prime minister.   Hashimoto's chances were bolstered further when former FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa, who controls the third-largest faction inthe party, also said he prefered to have an ``young andprogressive'' person to head the party and the government.   The conservative Liberal Democrats have worked quickly tominimize the political vacuum created by Uno's decision to stepdown to take responsibility for Sunday's election defeat, in whichthe conservative party lost control of the 252-member upper houseof Parliament for the first time in 34 years.   Hashimoto declined to comment about his candidacy, because ``Iam in a position to help the party to select the next president.''   For decades, Japan's prime ministers have been men in theirmid-60s or older who reached the office after a steadyapprenticeship through a succession of increasingly importantCabinet and party posts. Hashimoto, in Parliament since he was 26,has not held top Cabinet posts such as the finance portfolio, andhe became party secretary general only in June.   Untainted by scandal, Hashimoto was the most active campaignerfor July 23 election, making 90 appearances during the 14-daycampaign while Uno stayed in the background.   Uno was virtually hand-picked by former Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita behind closed doors after Takeshita resigned to takeresponsibility for a widespread influence-peddling scandal thattouched much of the party's top leadership.   ``The real key is to make the process (of selecting the nextprime minster) as transparent as possible,'' Hashimoto said in aninterview.   Whoever becomes party leader and prime minister will have to bein effect reconfirmed in October when the term as party leaderexpires.   The party is ``working to find a candidate strong and popularenough to be re-elected unanimously'' in the fall, Hashimoto said.   ``This time around, we are aware we have to have a new leaderwhose leadership can been forseen in longer terms,'' he said. Unohad been seen as a caretaker leader, lacking a power base withinthe party.   Meanwhile, officials of the Japan Socialist Party, which seeksto form a coalition with three small centrist parties against thegoverning party, said it would ask them to support SocialistChairwoman Takako Doi in the prime ministerial election inParliament.   An opposition party official, speaking anonymously, said thenegotiations for a common candidate ``have to overcome manyhurdles'' before reaching an agreement.   Analysts said opposition parties are unlikely to come up withone common candidate because of policy gaps among themselves, butthey have a good chance to force the governing party into agreeingto early elections for the more powerful lower house before itsfour-year term ends in July 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
