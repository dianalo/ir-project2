The policy change, which has emerged in recent days, follows last week's major round of interest-rate cuts in Europe, led by West Germany, and the announcement of a West German fiscal-stimulus package.    Both moves had long been sought by the Reagan administration, and European officials last week called on the U.S. to reciprocate by showing stronger support for the dollar, whose recent depreciation has hurt foreign concerns selling in the U.S.    The broad policy trade-off accomplishes some of the steps that governments have been hinting would take place at a new meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations. Thus it may ease pressure to convene such a meeting before year end.    Since the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, the Reagan administration and the Federal Reserve Board have chosen to emphasize policies that stress easier money in the U.S. to avoid a recession, even if that means higher interest rates aren't available as a tool to prop up the dollar.    Treasury Secretary James Baker outlined this policy choice in a Nov. 5 interview with The Wall Street Journal that caused consternation abroad. What's more, the Fed hasn't appeared to be a major participant in central-bank intervention to support the dollar.    But U.S. officials, who discussed the latest policy adjustment only in general terms and on condition of anonymity, said the European moves have given the U.S. more room to shape policy in support of the dollar without risking a recession at home. And, they noted, the dollar has fallen further since Mr. Baker's interview.    So, they said, more attention will now be paid to supporting the currency. &quot;The fundamentals are different now, so policy needs to react,&quot; said one official.    It isn't clear exactly what form the new U.S. approach will take, or how much effect it will have on the dollar.    However, the shift apparently has already begun to show up in heavier intervention by the Federal Reserve to buy dollars in foreign-exchange markets, and thus help boost the greenback. Such intervention by the Fed is kept secret until well after the fact, but currency traders late last week discerned a new pattern of intervention by the Fed to support the dollar, in conjunction with the West German central bank, the Bundesbank.    The American officials discouraged the notion that increased support for the dollar would lead to any early rise in U.S. interest rates, and they stressed that the shift was one of degree and nuance, not a sharp change in course. The new policy isn't a formal plan or a substitute for the kind of new international-currency accord which many government officials abroad have advocated.    The Fed's earlier reluctance to intervene heavily by buying dollars has been widely interpreted as a means of letting the dollar drift lower in order to pressure West Germany to ease its monetary and fiscal policies. While the U.S. wasn't actively talking the dollar down, it wasn't taking major steps to support the currency. Now that Germany and others have acted, the pressure has shifted.    &quot;The U.S. has asked for certain steps to be taken by its partners and they've responded. Now we're being asked to respond,&quot; said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and manager of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. &quot;They're saying, 'We've taken our steps, now you have to be a little more cooperative in supporting the dollar.' U.S. policy is being forced to clarity.&quot;    From the Friday before the crash through the middle of last week -- just before West Germany acted -- the dollar had dropped about 8% against the West German mark and 7% against the Japanese yen.    One way to stop the decline would have been to increase the spread in interest rates between the U.S. and other countries by raising U.S. rates to attract foreign investors to the dollar. But Mr. Baker has been adamantly against tightening money at home -- especially in the 1988 election year -- given the fears of a recession already raised by the stock crash.    West Germany's decision to cut its rates, however, increased the spread in rates -- and the appeal of the dollar -- without requiring tighter money in the U.S. That has given U.S. policy more leeway.    It appears that over the past few weeks, the Group of Seven has achieved some of the policy accommodations it had been thought might have to come from a new Group meeting to amend or replace last February's Louvre accord. The Group of Seven countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    In addition to the coordinated European rate reductions and Germany's fiscal stimulus plan -- all designed to accelerate growth -- the U.S. has outlined a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit, has delayed consideration of the protectionist trade bill, and now has resumed more active support for the dollar. Japan hasn't been pressed for new policies because it is embarked on strong domestic-led growth due to a stimulus package introduced in reaction to earlier U.S. pressure.    U.S. officials said a Group of Seven meeting hasn't been set, but that the countries continue to discuss such a session and a new accord. They said a meeting may still be held in coming weeks.    The decision to hold a new meeting could turn on whether markets and political opinion appear satisfied that Group of Seven government policies are now in harmony and are bold enough to help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit without causing recessions abroad.    But there is great skepticism about the measures enacted so far. Both the U.S. and West German fiscal packages have been roundly criticized as too weak; the new shift in U.S. policy on the dollar could be too subtle to do much good. For instance, it isn't known if the U.S. has agreed with its partners on exchange rate target zones to be supported, or on how far the U.S. will go to back the dollar at any given level.    So a formal new Group of Seven accord, reached at a meeting and requiring strong mutual action, could be necessary to create confidence in the world financial order.    &quot;It's a question of deciding if more needs to be done, and what's the best way to do it,&quot; said one official. &quot;Nothing is impossible.&quot;    Albert Soria, vice president and foreignexchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., in New York, added, &quot;The ball has been tossed back into our court&quot; following the interest-rate cuts in Europe.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   Rumors swept a thin market and pushed the dollar higher against major European currencies. The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen on the belief that Japan won't cut interest rates as many European central banks did last week.    In early Tokyo trading Monday, the dollar opened at 132.60 yen, unchanged from Friday's close. An official of a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who didn't want to be named, said there weren't any domestic factors to explain the stabilization of the dollar.    While the dollar rose to 1.6695 West German marks in late New York trading from 1.6625 late Thursday, the U.S. currency eased to 132.50 yen from 132.75. The British pound fell to $1.7920 from $1.8030.    With Japanese interest rates left unchanged while many rates in Europe fell, the yen strengthened against most major currencies. It also was boosted by recent reports of a strengthening Japanese economy. In early European trading Friday, the dollar dipped to a new low of 131.95 yen, surpassing the record of 131.98 yen set Monday.    &quot;The market has begun to realize that the yen can strengthen more,&quot; Mr. Soria said.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, Dec. 4, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
