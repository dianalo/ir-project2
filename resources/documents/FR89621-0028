These proposed feed additive regulations are being established topermit processing of peanuts which have been treated in connection withproposed EPA Experimental Permit No. 239-EUP-112.The scientific data reported and other relevant material have been evaluated.The toxicological data considered in support of these regulations include:1. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of10 ppm at 0.71 mg/kg/day and a lowest effect level (LEL) at 100 ppm.2. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 40 mg/kg/day and LEL of 200mk/kg/day. 3. An Ames mutagenicity study was negative at 1 to 500 andCx.18;g/plate withand without activation. 4. A sister chormatid exchange mutgagenicity study was negative. 5. A study in mammalian cells, <T3>in vitro </T3>cytogenetics in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO), isnegative for chormosomal aberrations. The nature of the residue is adquately understood, and an adequate analyticalmethod is available for enforcement purposes. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that the pesticidecan be safely used in the prescribed manner when such use is in accordancewith the label and labeling accepted in connection with the experimentaluse permit issued pursuant to the Federal insecticide, fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) as amended (86 Stat. 973, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.), and the regulationsare proposed as set forth below. This regulation will expire on May 5,1991. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA), as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein,may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that this rulemaking proposal be referred toan Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments should bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber (FAP 6H5512/P489). Written comments filed in response to this petitionwill be available in the Information Services Section, at the address givenabove from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new food and feed additive levels, or conditionsfor safe use of additives, or raising such food and feed additive levelsdo not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 40 CFR Part 186 </ITAG>Animal feeds, Pesticide and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 8, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
