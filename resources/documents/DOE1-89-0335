EPA's research, development, and demonstrationprogram concentrates on predicting the transport and transformation ofhazardous chemicals in soil, water, ground water, and the biosphere;improving environmental detection and monitoring methods, determiningthe effects of hazardous wastes on human health; evaluating existingwaste control technologies; developing innovative and emerging wastecontrol technologies; and assessing the risks to human health and ecosystemsposed by hazardous wastes. Committed to scientific and engineering excellence,EPA has established university-based research centers to support long-termenvironmental research in science and engineering. Federal support forinnovative and emerging technologies has extended to support of partnershipswith the private sector. Nowhere is this more advanced than in the SuperfundInnovative Technology Evaluation program, where the law mandates evaluationsof 10 new technologies each year. A cornerstone of EPA's research program,projected to increase in importance as US hazardous waste laws and regulationsstabilize, is its technical assistance and dissemination of technicalinformation to EPA regions and state and local governments regardingspecific, technical operational or enforcement problems.</TEXT></DOC>
