Four people died, 35 were injured. A few days later, a tractor-trailer flipped over on I-26 in Saluda, N.C., spilling 36,000 pounds of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The chemical mixed with rain to form a toxic cloud, requiring evacuation of 100 people.    These and other truck-related accidents have rated extensive news coverage. Would-be analysts, some of whom we suspect of being not entirely objective, are saying that trucking deregulation by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 has produced this epidemic of highway mayhem.    The truth is more complex. Deregulation has put more trucks on the road, and is saving shippers and consumers billions of dollars. But the incidence of accidents relative to the number of miles traveled has actually declined.    The raw data that attempt to establish a correlation between deregulation and trucking accidents show a 25% increase in the number of accidents between 1983 and 1985 and an 11% increase in fatalities over roughly the same period.    Such statistics support the worst suspicions of every motorist who has ever had an 18-wheeler riding his rear bumper. But they do not mean that the average trucker has become more reckless. The opposite seems to be true. An index compiled by Americans for Safe and Competitive Trucking (a coalition of shippers, carriers, manufacturers, consumer advocates and public-interest groups) shows a decline in injury and fatality rates per vehicle mile.    The ASCT index of injuries dropped to 79 in 1985 from 101 in 1981. The fatality index went to 82 from 111. Both are measured against a 1974 base of 100.    Our past experience with other safety scares has caused us to keep a sharp lookout for hidden agendas. We haven't found one in explicit terms but certainly the Teamsters union, which has felt the impact of nonunion trucking since 1980, won't mind seeing a rise in accidents blamed on deregulation. Neither will one-time ICC certificate owners, who were allowed under regulation to fix prices and divide up routes. We suspect that a number of people would like to see trucking re-regulated.    But deregulation did not open a door to wild trucking. Trucks still are subject to safety inspections and drivers to licensing requirements. Drivers who own their own rigs have a financial stake in safety unlike some of the hired cowboys of yesteryear.    The successful carriers in today's deregulated industry tend to be nonunionized (with labor costs 20% to 40% lower than unionized rivals) and more efficient (lower cost per vehicle mile) than the dominant carriers of the regulated era. A just-released Cato Institute policy paper by Robert V. Delaney estimates annual deregulatory savings to U.S. producers and distributors of $90 billion. This further translates into $80 billion a year in savings for consumers. A further $28 billion in annual savings is possible, Mr. Delaney says, if the 43 states that regulate intrastate trucking follow the federal example.    The U.S. Department of Transportation has programs in place to improve truck safety. It will establish a national driver's license for interstate truckers, operate a computer network to record dangerous truckers with multiple safety violations and apportion money to the states for improved truck inspections.    It is important to understand that the economic deregulation of the trucking industry and truck safety are separate issues. The way to improve truck safety is not to restore economic regulation but to do a better job of enforcing safety rules. </TEXT></DOC>
