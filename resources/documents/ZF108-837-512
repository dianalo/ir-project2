 That is, thelogical makeup of any network fluctuates from moment to moment.andM;For example, the number of data and application files in use or stored away,the amount of available disk storage space, the number of users logged in tothe LAN, and the volume of traffic passing through the network cabling allchange continually.andP;  Moreover, a network offers users adistributed-processing environment, with some processing performed by acentrally located server, some done at users' workstations, adding even moreactivity to the LAN.andM;Keeping this conglomeration of network hardware, software, cables, and thepeople using them working efficiently comes under the rather ambiguous termof network management.andP;  It's ambiguous in that managing a network can rangefrom the simple to the complex, from a moment's quick fix of plugging in amisplaced network cable to a day-long search for an obscure disk problem.andM;Network management can be as simple as creating a boot diskette for a newuser and making sure that user has proper access to network resources.andO;(Although in truth these jobs may not be all that simple in some widelydistributed networks.)andM;Or managing a network can include daily disk-maintenance duties--backing upnetwork files or defragmenting disk directories.andP;  Or it may meantroubleshooting the LAN, trying to discover why some users are experiencingslow network response.andP;  Or it may include reconfiguring a remote internetworkdevice to improve overall system performance.andM;In short, network management incorporates an almost unlimited list ofduties--basically, doing whatever it takes to keep the LAN running smoothingand efficiently, with minimal (if any) downtime.andM;This job has grown even more difficult as networks have become larger andmore complex.andP;  The evolution from small workgroups of often-identical PCs tolarge internets made up of dissimilar machines--IBM PS/2s, Macintoshes, PCclones, printers, communications gateways, and bridges and routers--hasbrought more power to the desktop while adding immense complexity to thenetwork manager's job.andM;Fortunately, vendors are developing more and better tools--somesoftware-based, others complete systems that provide onscreen maps of networkresources--to help in the endless task of managing a network.andM;From Simple to ComplexandM;Network management tools, whether they are as application-specific as aperformance monitor or as comprehensive as IBM's mainframe-based NetViewproduct, help bring some order to the potentially chaotic network managementenvironment.andP;  They give network managers information and capabilities theycan use in the battle to keep their LANs running trouble-free.andM;Whether they are intended to merely find cable breaks or to pinpoint thecause of a network slowdown, network management tools are vital to thenetwork manager's day-to-day life.andP;  They can help ensure uptime and networkreliability, maintain predetermined performance levels, manage LAN resourcesoptimally, plan for expansion, maintain company security, keep track ofnetwork use, and provide a basis for charging customers for network time.andM;For example, knowing how many network users regularly access a laserprinter--and how long they have to wait for their printed material toappear--can help a company decide when it's time to add a second printer.andO;Knowing which workstations generate the heaviest traffic lets a networkadministrator predict possible bottlenecks--bottlenecks that can be avoidedby adding internetwork devices such as bridges or routers.andM;Five Functional AreasandM;At the very basic level, network management requirements generally fall intofive functional areas: configuration management, fault management, securitymanagement, performance management, and accounting management.andM;Configuration management applications deal with installing, initializing,&quot;boot&quot; loading, modifying, and tracking the configuration parameters oroptions of network hardware and software.andP;  For instance, 3Com's NetworkControl Servers can monitor and reconfigure boot-up parameters and changeport settings on the company's communications servers and change internetworkbridge filter options.andM;Fault management tools provide an audit trail, or historical overview, of anetwork's error and alarm characteristics.andP;  These types of tools show a LANmanager the number, types, times, and locations of network errors.andP;  Theseerrors might be dropped packets and retransmissions (on an Ethernet) or &quot;losttokens&quot; (on a Token Ring).andM;Security management tools allow the network manager to restrict access tovarious resources, from the applications and files to the entire networkitself; these generally offer password-protection schemes that give usersdifferent levels of access to different resources.andP;  For instance, a user inmarketing could be allowed to view, or &quot;read,&quot; a data file in accounting butnot be permitted to change, or &quot;write&quot; to it.andM;Security management is also important in managing the network itself--forinstance, only certain individuals (network administrators) should bepermitted to change configuration settings on a server or other key networkdevice.andM;Performance management tools produce real-time and historical statisticalinformation about the network's operation: how many packets are beingtransmitted at any given moment, the number of users logged into a specificserver, and utilization of internetwork lines.andP;  As already noted, this typeof information can help network administrators pinpoint areas or networksegments that pose potential problems.andM;Performance management tools generally allow polling individual networknodes--a server or bridge, for example--for component-specific information.andO;A communications server might provide information on throughput for eachserial port, while a file server might report the number of users logged in,what applications they are using, and the number of active files.andP;  Thisinformation can then be studied to determine which gateways, servers, orrouters are being used heavily and may need added capabilities in the future.andM;Accounting management applications help their users allocate the costs ofvarious network resources--a public data network gateway, access to amainframe session, or printer time--to those using them.andP;  These applicationsprovide information about session start up/stop, user logins and resourceuse, and audit trail data.andP;  Companies can then use this information to billdepartments internally or customers for computer and/or network time.andM;Built-In NOS ManagementandM;Most network operating systems (NOSs) provide some level of networkmanagement capabilities; in particular, almost all the leading NOSs offerpassword-protection schemes that limit users' access to network resources.andO;Novell, for instance, implements its NetWare management scheme through userprofiles, which define not only the user's access rights, but the users'classifications (supervisor, workgroup manager, console operator, or user),which also determine the resources they can access.andM;In this scheme, a supervisor has access rights that allow recontiguring andupgrading the entire system.andP;  The workgroup manager, available only withNetWare 386, controls only the resources of a single user or user group.andO;This concept allows a supervisor to distribute some of the responsibility formaintaining the network to others around a large network.andM;A user with console operator access rights can run NetWare's FCONSOLEutility, which allows monitoring and controlling a variety of networkperformance criteria, such as print queues.andP;  The user can access only thoseresources allowed by the supervisor (or workgroup manager with NetWare 386).andO;Although users can access the NetWare management utilities, their rights toactually perform management functions is severely limited.andM;Although other NOSs access schemes may differ in specific features fromNetWare's, they all offer similar resource-restriction capabilities that givethe network managers control over their LANs.andM;Programmable ManagersandM;Many other network-products vendors also offer specific network managementproducts that address more-detailed needs.andP;  These include 3Com's NCSproducts, Sun Microsystems's SunNet Manager, SynOptics' LattisNet networkmanagement system (NMS), and Hughes LAN Systems' 9100 Network ManagementCenter.andM;SynOptics' LattisNet NMS, for instance, can be programmed to automaticallydisconnect stations that exceed network manager-defined performance or errorthresholds.andM;Sun designed its SunNet Manager to work with other vendors' &quot;agent&quot;applications that add specific functionality to a system.andP;  For example,various agents can perform monitoring and controlling capabilities ongateways and routers.andM;Other products, however, deliver only partial solutions.andP;  These devicesinclude protocol analyzers, which provide configuration and performance databut no accounting management capabilities.andM;Management StandardsandM;As networks have grown larger and become increasingly heterogeneous innature, so has the need for industry-standard network management protocols(and products) that operate across a wide range of vendor offerings.andP;  Thefirst of these protocols, the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), wasdeveloped by the Internet Activities Board in 1988.andP;  (The Internet is aninternational wide area network that links thousands of users, vendors, anduniversities.)andP;  SNMP relies on the Transmission Control Protocol/InternetProtocol (TCP/IP) as the underlying mechanism for transferring data betweendifferent types of systems (i.e., PC LANs and mainframes) and networks.andM;Briefly, SNMP is a protocol that defines the communication between a networkmanagement station and an object to be managed.andP;  SNMP's three-layerarchitecture (network management stations, network elements, and a common setof protocols that binds them together) operates with a management informationbase (MIB) and a structure of management information (SMI).andP;  The MIB and SMIare network management concepts that allow defining each network element sothese elements can be monitored, then controlled by the management stations.andM;Though widely accepted, SNMP has several limitations.andP;  For one, it isconsidered too simplistic for managing the large, global-style networksevolving today, and its manager-to-agent architecture leaves it incapable ofmanaging true enterprisewide LANs, which require manager-to-manager andmanager-to-agent systems.andM;Eventually, the evolving Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP), thenetwork management standard for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networks,will overshadow TCP/IP.andM;Another would-be network management standard, called CMOT--for CMIP overTCP/IP--was proposed and developed in 1988 and 1989, but failed to gain broadsupport from vendors or end users.andP;  Basically, CMOT allows OSI-based CMIPfunctions to run over TCP/IP networks.andP;  It was designed as a migratoryprotocol that would allow smooth transition from SNMP to OSI, but neverbecame popular.andM;Because products based on it are widely available--more than 40 vendors,including Sun and SynOptics, make compatible products--SNMP remains thenetwork management protocol of choice for most PC-based network managers.andM;Other vendors providing SNMP-compatible products include Cabletron Systems,which is adding SNMP capabilities to all its products, Network Research,Wellfleet, and FiberCom.andM;Host-Based SystemsandM;Four mainframe-based network management protocols with wide industry supportare IBM's NetView, ATandamp;T's Unified Network Management Architecture (UNMA),Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OpenView, and Digital Equipment Corp.'s (DEC)Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA).andM;Although proprietary in nature, these protocols enjoy broad end-user supportbecause of their associated vendors' large installed bases of computers.andO;With the protocols already available, many users incorporate their primaryvendor's network management products into their LANs as a matter of course.andM;IBM's NetView permits non-IBM networks to access the NetView host via itsNetView/PC gateway product.andP;  IBM has announced that it will provide anOSI-based CMIP interface to NetView in the future.andP;  This interface will allowthe NetView host to manage heterogeneous networks, a task now made almostimpossible by the complex nature of NetView.andM;DEC, HP, and ATandamp;T have all said they plan to utilize CMIP with theirrespective protocols.andP;  Like most other vendors, however, they are waiting fora more stable version of the OSI protocol.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
