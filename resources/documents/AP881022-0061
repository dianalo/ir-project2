The struggle against time and thickening Arctic ice has grippedU.S. schoolchildren, made front-page news in Italy and France andgained extensive coverage by Soviet television news.   ``It's the kitten in the tree syndrome. If a kitten gets caught,everybody gathers around to rescue it,'' said Patricia Warhol,director of the American Cetacean Society in San Pedro, Calif.   ``We can't do much about Japanese whale hunters, ocean pollutionand gill nets. But here are three whales that maybe we can save,''Ms. Warhol said in a telephone interview.   A combination of early ice and shifting winds trapped the threeCalifornia gray whales more than two weeks ago near thenorthernmost tip of Alaska. Part of an endangered species, thegiant mammals feed in northern waters before migrating pastCalifornia to breed in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.   Rescuers hope to free them by pulverizing a path through fourmiles of ice. They succeeded in drawing the whales nearly a halfmile to open water with a string of holes Friday, but one of themammals disappeared later in the day and was presumed dead.   Television has delivered daily scenes of the struggling whalesemerging to breathe every two minutes, their battered,barnacle-encrusted snouts rubbed to the bone by jagged ice.   ``It's a very powerful emotional scene,'' said Cynthia Wilson ofthe Friends of the Earth, an environmental group in Washington,D.C. ``We're not dealing with a bunch of fish. This is a mammal ofextraordinary intelligence that has been extraordinarily hunted andpersecuted.''   Their plight is a teaching tool in classes such as CathyGarrett's kindergarten at Fremont Elementary School in San Diego,Calif.   ``Little children love anything big,'' Ms. Garrett said.``They're very concerned about how the whales got trapped and whythey need to come up to breathe. They're aware these animals have aright to live. They're fascinated by them.   ``They want them to survive. They don't want them to be hurt.''   The drama has produced a wave of support from well-wishers,including a telephone pep talk from President Reagan to chilledrescuers. Some have suggested using explosives, rock salt andbowling balls to defeat the ice.   ``We get calls and calls and calls,'' said Anne Dingall,director of ocean ecology for the environmental group Greenpeace.``A lot of people are phoning for information or to see if there'sanything they can do to help.''   One suggestion paid immediate dividends. Greg Ferrian and RickSkluzacek, two brothers-in-law from Lakeland, Minn., flew to Alaskaat their own expense Wednesday to use their de-icing machines toenlarge the whales' air pockets.   The frozen theater has been front-page news in Italy and France,where TV newscasts play whale clips prominently.   Soviet coverage has been unusually extensive, with the nightlynews program Vremya carrying reports every day. Some Muscovites saythe rescue attempts give them a good impression of Americans'concern for life, more than any disarmament initiatives.   West Germany's ZDF television network was more tongue-in-cheek.Its report Thursday night said the ``Walkampf,'' a German compoundmeaning whale struggle, had upstaged the presidential``Wahlkampf,'' the German word for election campaign. Pronunciationof the two words is identical.   And one South African whale expert was skeptical about therescue effort.   Peter Best of the South African Museum in Cape Town said in aninterview published Friday that the rescue effort ``is all veryhumanitarian and noble, but it makes nonsense out of U.S. fundingfor (maritime) research,'' which he said has been slashed.   Gray whales were hunted to near extinction by the 1920s, whentheir numbers dipped to below 1,000 while their skins were used forbuggy whips and corsets and their teeth fashioned into ivoryjewelry.   Environmentalists now estimate their population at about 20,000.</TEXT></DOC>
