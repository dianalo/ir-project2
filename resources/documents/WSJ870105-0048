According to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. from Sept. 30 through Dec. 23, the net asset value of the average general equity fund rose 3.75%. That compares with these funds' average 8.40% drop in the third quarter.    Benefiting from slightly better fourth-quarter increases among 10 categories of specialized equity funds, all 755 equity funds tracked by Lipper last quarter rose an average 3.77% through Dec. 23. That group had fallen an average 5.94% in the September quarter.    Last quarter, 306 fixed-income funds on which Lipper keeps statistics rose 2.94%, or more than double the 1.43% average gain in this group the preceding quarter. The Lipper fixed-income fund group includes only those funds holding taxable long-term securities.    The universe of 1109 mutual funds tracked by Lipper gained an average 3.57% in the quarter through Dec. 23, following a 3.76% drop in the previous quarter. Yet the Sandamp;P 500, calculated with dividends reinvested, rose 5.61%, according to a Lipper estimate. It had fallen 6.97% in the third quarter.    Michael Lipper, who heads Lipper Analytical, warns that tax-motivated extra distributions by many funds late last year could result in larger than usual adjustments in the full fourth-quarter figures that his firm will release tomorrow.    The preliminary data reveal a remarkably homogeneous performance among the fund managers. But none of the 18 fund groupings out-performed the Sandamp;P 500.    For instance, in the latest quarter, each of the Lipper fund categories posted gains, ranging from 5.80% for the science and technology fund group to 1.27% for the option growth funds.    That sharply contrasted with performance variations in the third quarter, when 11 of the Lipper fund groupings lost ground while the other seven rose. Even that understated the wide performance discrepancies in the third quarter, when small growth company funds plunged an average 14.83% as gold-oriented funds surged an average 28.69%.    Mr. Lipper attributed several factors to the fund managers' failure to match the Sandamp;P last quarter.    For one thing, the Sandamp;P last year, and especially in the fourth quarter, benefited from &quot;a lot of merger and acquisition activity involving stocks on the list,&quot; Mr. Lipper says. For another, &quot;Fund managers are typically more broadly invested than the Sandamp;P, which turned out to be a penalty last quarter because of the way the secondary stocks lagged the market,&quot; he adds.    In addition, management expenses penalized fund managers' performance in comparison with the Sandamp;P 500. Such expenses are subtracted from assets in calculating fund performance, but there aren't any such costs reflected in the Sandamp;P 500 performance.    Finally, and perhaps most significantly, &quot;the funds have a lot of cash around right now,&quot; says Mr. Lipper, who estimates the typical mutual fund's cash reserve these days stands at a relatively high 10% of its assets. Since such cash reserves typically are invested in relatively low-yielding short-term money market instruments, the larger the cash position, the greater the performance penalty in an up market, he says.    ---   BETTER LATE THAN . . . L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Holdings Inc., parent of the old-line Wall Street investment bank, is finally entering the mutual fund management arena that many of its competitors entered long ago. Months of messy internal policy squabbling ended just recently, when Thomas I. Unterberg, chairman, and A. Robert Towbin, vice chairman, picked up their marbles and left. They'd been trying to keep Rothschild's nose to its traditional grindstone -- underwriting emerging growth companies, especially high-technology concerns. Other insiders wanted to widen its mission to securities trading and other businesses.    Initially, Rothschild will offer three new funds -- one holding stocks of companies believed likely to raise their dividends; an income fund holding mostly investment-grade debt issues; and a dividend income fund aimed at attracting idle cash of corporations, which are exempt from federal income taxes on 80% of the dividends they receive. William J. Lippman, 61 years old, former president of Pilgrim group, is president of Rothschild's new fund management unit and Burton J. Greenwald, 57, former president of the Merit Group, is its executive vice president. </TEXT></DOC>
