The bolometric detector consisting of three layers (5-{mu}m-thickgold absorber, 7-{mu}m-thick polyimide foil, and 0.1-{mu}m-thick goldresistor grid) was developed for this measurement. In typical diverteddischarges with NB heating, the ratios of power radiated from the mainand divertor chambers to the absorbed power were approximately 10% and20%, respectively. Intense poloidal asymmetries of radiated power localizednear the X point outside the torus were observed in diverted discharges.The profiles of the radiated power were reconstructed by an Abel inversionwith an asymmetric term. On the other hand, a poloidally asymmetric radiationband localized near the inner wall, ''marfe,'' was observed for denseplasmas in limiter discharges with neutral beam heating.</TEXT></DOC>
