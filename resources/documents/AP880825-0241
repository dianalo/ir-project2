The decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirms anearlier U.S. District Court ruling.   The decision also bars a threatened strike against CNW's Chicagoandamp; North Western Transportation Co. railroad by unions opposed tothe proposed track sale.   The Railway Labor Executives' Association had filed a motion tostop the railroad from closing the sale to FRVR Corp., a subsidiaryof Chicago-based Itel Corp.   The association said Wednesday it was considering appealing thecircuit court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The labor group, citing the Railway Labor Act, had argued thatthe railroad was obligated to negotiate over the effects of thesale on its employees because it will result in changed pay,seniority and working conditions.   CNW contended the labor issues involved constitute a minordispute that should be resolved in binding arbitration.   ``We are free to sell branch lines to regional line operators,''said company spokesman James Foote after the ruling. ``The decisionmeans the unions can't strike over the sale because it's a minordispute.''   The section of track, which runs from Milwaukee to Green Bay,Wis., will be called the Fox River Valley Railroad after the saleto FRVR is complete, Foote said.   Chicago-based CNW is the holding company for the railroad, aleading Midwest freight hauler that also operates area commutertrains used by 41,000 people.   The sale of the line is not related to a contract dispute overtrain crew size that caused a brief strike at Candamp;NW earlier thismonth. The walkout was halted by Congress, which extended acooling-off period until Sept. 9.</TEXT></DOC>
