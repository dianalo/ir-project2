The contract includes production options valued at more than $100 million through 1993, depending on quantities ordered by the Navy, Martin Marietta said. The contract ultimately could exceed $250 million in production work, the company said.    Martin Marietta, an aerospace and data systems concern, said that beginning in 1994 it will compete for follow-on Navy production contracts for the sensor system with Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric, a defense contractor and maker of electric products. </TEXT></DOC>
