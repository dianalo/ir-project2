Based on data submittedby the manufacturer of the innovator product, the original dissolutionstandard was subsequently revised to ``85 percent at 45 minutes'' in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 15, 1985 (50 FR 47212).Another manufacturer has submitted data showing that although its productis bioequivalent to the innovator product, its product is unable to meetthe current dissolution standard. The new manufacturer has requested thatthe current dissolution standard be revised to the original specificationof ``80 percent at 60 minutes.'' The manufacturer has submitted comparativedissolution data to demonstrate that both the innovator product and itsbioequivalent product meet the original dissolution standard specification.FDA has reviewed the manufacturer's request and has tentatively concludedthat the current dissolution standard should be revised because it hasbeen shown to rule out products that are in fact bioequivalent to the innovatorproduct. Therefore, FDA is proposing that the monograph for erythromycincapsules be amended to revise the current dissolution standard from ``85percent at 45 minutes'' to ``80 percent at 60 minutes.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact</ITAG>The agency has considered the economic impact of this proposed rule andhas determined that it does not require a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis,as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). Specifically,the proposal would refine an existing technical provision without imposinga more stringent requirement. Accordingly, the agency certifies that thisrulemaking, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Submitting Comments or Requests for Conference</ITAG>Interested persons may, on or before December 26, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal.Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit single copies of comments.
