Depending on how aggressively the ministry pursues itsinvestigation, it may remove a major burden on the centralbank -- the need to keep rates high to tame the &quot;bubbleeconomy,&quot; or speculation in financial assets and real estate.After lowering rates at the start of July, the Bank of Japanis looking to ease them again for fear that the stockmarket's prolonged weakness may stymie domestic demand, someanalysts say.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the Bank of Japan may decide to let rates ebbfor brief periods to pump cash into the financial system tocushion the stock and other securities markets if newdisclosures related to the scandal weaken them.   To deflate the bubble further, the authorities &quot;willemphasize methods other than interest rates. The economy isslowing,&quot; said Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at DeutscheBank Group in Tokyo.   The rebuilding of the Bank of Japan's credibility aftertwo years of raising rates may have encouraged the FinanceMinistry to confront the apparent institutionalizedimproprieties of the Japanese markets. More than justpunishing the firms involved, stricter securities laws arenow possible.   Analysts don't see a direct link between the cut in ratesfour weeks ago amid the scandal and the subsequent probe, butthey said a general understanding of how to balance the needsof the real economy and deflate the bubble has been achieved.   The Bank of Japan has had to rely on monetary policy tocurb general inflation and stabilize the yen's exchange rateas well as rein in speculation. &quot;So far, the success of theBank of Japan is remarkable,&quot; said Russell Jones, senioreconomist at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew International Ltd., but thelonger the central bank juggled those priorities with theeconomy slowing, the greater the risk. The central bankdoesn't want the weakness of the securities markets todiscourage investment in plant and equipment.   But it does want to keep speculators in the securitiesmarkets on the run. &quot;They knew they had to take interestrates down. They were headed for an investment bust,&quot; saidMr. Courtis. &quot;But they hadn't yet broken the asset markets.&quot;   The willingness to press the investigation results fromthe realization that structural changes are necessary todeflate Japanese assets. The relaxation of overseas pressureon Japan to spur domestic growth and strengthen the yen givesthe authorities room to undo the excesses of past years. Theprobe, Mr. Courtis said, &quot;is one further step in unwindingthe financial dynamics of the 1980s.&quot;   Now a major responsibility for the Bank of Japan as theinvestigation proceeds is to cushion the markets from theblows of further disclosures. Gradual erosion in the marketsdoesn't worry the Bank of Japan, but it wants to prevent acollapse with the economy already slowing. &quot;The Bank of Japancan't afford to dismiss the impact of the weak stock marketon the real economy,&quot; said Mr. Jones. &quot;The Bank of Japan hasproved itself to be very sensitive to the vicissitudes of thestock market.&quot;   In early October, the Bank of Japan temporarily pumpedcash into the financial system after the market had a loss of15% of its value in one week. The Bank of Japan made moremodest additions of cash to the money market last week as thestock market lost 2.5% of its value in four days. On Monday,the Nikkei Stock Average fell 161.07 points to 22705.29,after falling 42.35 points Friday.   &quot;The Bank of Japan has to provide money to the stockmarket&quot; if it stumbles severely, Mr. Jones said.</TEXT></DOC>
