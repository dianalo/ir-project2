Corporate clients and consumers are expected to receiveless for their deposits and pay just as much for loansdespite the Fed's move Tuesday to reduce the banks' cost offunds. Banks have dragged their feet in similar fashion formore than a year as rates have fallen, attempting to offsetthe crimp in their earnings caused by problem loans andrising deposit insurance costs.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed's move cut 1/4 percentage point off the federalfunds rate, which banks charge each other for loans, takingit down to 5.5%. A lower federal funds rate helps bring downother short-term rates, including those on certificates ofdeposit paid by banks to their depositors.   Still, the Fed's action &quot;is unlikely to prompt any majorchange in bank lending rates for either businesses orconsumers,&quot; William Sullivan, a money market economist forDean Witter Reynolds, said, reflecting the sentiment of manyother analysts. &quot;The individual could come out a loser,&quot; hesaid, &quot;as banks drop their deposit rates and use this as anopportunity to bolster earnings.&quot;   Stocks of many money-center banks outperformed the marketyesterday in reaction to the rate move and the expectedfillip to earnings. The strong gains reflect the fact thatthese banks rely on overnight fed funds to a greater extentthan most regional banks and thus can immediately benefitfrom lower funding costs. Among the big New York andCalifornia banks, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. was up $1 at $53.25 inNew York Stock Exchange trading, Bankers Trust New York Corp.was up 62.5 cents at $59, BankAmerica Corp. was up $1.125 at$36.625, and Security Pacific Corp. was up 62.5 cents at$23.50.   Lower rates could benefit a whole set of banks, saidThomas Hanley of Salomon Brothers. Besides the wider lendingmargins, he cited the lower cost of carrying bad loans thataren't paying interest but still must be funded. Moreover,&quot;the lower you see the overall rate structure, the faster youare going to see nonperforming assets converted back toperforming loans,&quot; he said, noting that lower rates willpromote more sales of troubled real estate projects.   Bank stocks in general also rallied while the overallmarket languished. &quot;Banks that are up today are running 2-1,while the market is off a point,&quot; Carole Berger of C.J.Lawrence Inc. said late yesterday afternoon. &quot;It's not somuch that earnings will improve as that investors believebanks' returns on equity stand a better chance of beingmaintained during periods of declining interest rates.&quot;   Banks are unlikely to move quickly this time to lower theprime lending rate as they did within days in early May,after the most recent lowering of rates by the Fed. Then,however, the banks had already bided their time by notreacting to several previous Fed moves.   Richard Kovacevich, president of Norwest Corp., aMinneapolis-based banking concern, said he expects the fedfunds rate will have to decline another quarter of apercentage point before banks lower the current 8.5% primerate. That rate affects rates on home-equity loans toconsumers and loans to small and medium-sized companies.   Still, analysts point out that the spread between the fedfunds rate and the prime rate is at a trigger point. It usedto take a spread of two percentage points or less to triggera drop in the prime rate. Now the spread is three percentagepoints between the prime and fed funds and nearly that muchbetween the prime and 90-day certificates of deposit, whichnow yield an average 5.56%. Thus, the spread is &quot;historicallyhigh, which could mean a drop in the prime in the next fewweeks,&quot; said Mr. Hanley.   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,said the spread has widened because of &quot;widespread creditproblems in the economy&quot; and skepticism among bankers that aneconomic recovery is firmly in place. So while the cut in thefed funds rate increases the likelihood of a cut in the primerate, he isn't so sure that one will take place.   Even if the prime rate is cut, it may not be followed byfurther moves in consumer loan rates. &quot;Since the beginning ofthe year, the consumer has been short-changed,&quot; said RobertHeady, president of Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks consumerdeposit and loan rates across the nation. While the primerate has fallen from 10% at the start of this year, andshort-term CDs are now yielding 1 1/2 percentage points lessthan then, unsecured personal loan rates have declined only26 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, andcredit card rates are up 10 basis points, he said.   Except for home equity loans, little consumer lending isbased on the prime rate. Mr. Kovacevich differs with mostanalysts in that he expects the lower cost of funds, coupledwith the need to promote lending, to spur banks to reducepersonal loan costs as well as other consumer loan prices.   Where consumers do stand to benefit from the Fed's moveand the recent trend toward lower rates in general is in homemortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages are affected by 30-yearTreasury bond rates, which have been declining. Andadjustable-rate mortgages are often priced in relation toTreasury bills, whose rates are influenced by the fed fundsrate.   Mr. Kovacevich also notes that even if the prime ratedoesn't decline soon, many companies will benefit from thedrop in short-term interest rates. That is because at leasthalf of all corporate borrowing, especially by largercorporations, is at rates that are tied to the Londoninterbank offered rate, the fed funds rate or certificate ofdeposit rates.</TEXT></DOC>
