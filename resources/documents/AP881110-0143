But she isalso a lawyer with steely determination, who induced labor for herfirst child so she could take the bar exam.   Bright and ambitious, the wife of Vice President-elect Dan Quaylehad made no secret of her desire to return to work and pursue herown career this fall after more than a decade of postponing it formotherhood. Whether that's now possible _ being a Washington lawyerwho is also the vice president's wife _ remains to be seen.   But at 39, Mrs. Quayle sees herself as part of the ``vanguard ofthe future'' for women of her generation, the first ``brought up tothink that women shouldn't just look to get married, that you shouldhave a career.''   ``There's no door closed. We've all realized that there's no setrole that a woman has to take. And I can look at every opportunityand decide what's best for me without thinking of what is expectedof me,'' she said in a recent interview.   A lot was expected of her during the campaign, and Mrs. Quaylesaid she was ``pushed hard'' by ``having as much attention drawn tome.''   Republican strategists saw her as a weapon against thecontroversy that sometimes surrounded her husband. Quayle sometimesgarbled his words and was flustered at tough questions. She wasalways cool and prepared. He did no major television interviews. Shedid ``20@20'' soon after the campaign began.   Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant who worked with thecampaign, says Mrs. Quayle was viewed as someone who was better ableto communicate with working women through ``shared experience andvalues'' than was her husband ``with all of his reputed good looks.''   Mrs. Quayle traveled the country on her own vigorous campaignschedule. Inevitably, her crisp professional performance provokedcomments, only half in jest, that she should be the vicepresidential nominee.   Rumor also put her in line for her husband's Senate seat when heresigns. Insiders view that as unlikely, although Mrs. Quayledoesn't put an end to such speculation.   ``I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,'' she told oneinterviewer.   Marilyn Tucker was born in Indianpolis, the daughter of twophysicians, Warren and Mary Alice Tucker. The family left the localPresbyterian church for the teachings of Col. Robert Thieme, a Texaspreacher known for unorthodox biblical interpretations and forverbal attacks on liberals, welfare recipients, homosexuals andothers.   Mrs. Quayle, a fundamentalist, admires Thieme for hisinterpretation of the Bible from original Greek, Hebrew and Latinversions. She says she has no knowledge of his politicalpronouncements. The family attends a Virginia church that is part ofthe conservative Presbyterian Church in America.   The couple met while attending Indiana University Law School and,she says, ``swept each other off our feet.'' They were married 10weeks later. They have three children, Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne.   Mrs. Quayle says she induced labor in 1974 so she could deliverin time to take the Indiana bar exam. Her doctor, ``figured outexactly how many days before the bar exam I would be able to haveTucker and still be able to sit through two days of the exam,'' shesaid.   She doesn't consider that unusual, adding that ``all my otherkids were induced.''   The Quayles set up a law practice above the newspaper run byQuayle's father in Huntington, Ind. Mrs. Quayle did most of thelawyering while her husband was associate publisher. After hiselection to Congress in 1976, she continued to work. She soonstopped to become a fulltime mother but not to sit home ``eating bonbons and watching the soaps.''   ``Whether it's working with study groups and doing research _ Ido quite a bit of speaking _ I've managed to be able to contributequite a bit, I think, in all different areas,'' she said.   She is one of her husband's top advisers. Early in the campaignshe was quite protective, tugging on his sleeve to pull him awayfrom the press. She criticizes the media for what she says is aliberal bias and for scrutiny of her husband's military service,academic record and personal life.   But resentment, she says, ``isn't part of my life.'' She says sheis not bitter, for example, that her career may once again be put onhold by her husband's vice presidency.   ``Why be unhappy? Take every opportunity you have to make thebest out of the situation. You don't stew on things that might havebeen.''</TEXT></DOC>
