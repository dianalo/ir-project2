The investigation dealt with setting up a natural gas,district heat and power supply and the use of renenable energy sourcesfrom agriculture and forests as an alternative. The starting point inthis area with rural structures is a major chemical plant and large loadswith connected thermal values of 200-1200 kW each whose demand is metby petroleum. The report mainly refers to the results of a questionnairepresented to households to investigate heating habits, the energy sourcesused for space heating and to determine the saving potentials in thebuildings of the area covered. An essential potential to save energyin space heating is seen in the substitution of unprofitable (over-dimensioned)heating plants by plants corresponding with the norms and with the demand.(PJH).</TEXT></DOC>
