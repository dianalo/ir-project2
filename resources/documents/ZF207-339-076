(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Expensive Cabling Is Not Always NeededandM;Because local area networks put new demands on cable, they need moreefficient cable implementations than the older terminal-to-mainframetechnology, an industry executive said recently.andM;Edward G. Groark, president of Riverbend Group, McLean, Va., told members ofthe local area network special interest group of the Federal ADP Users Groupthat hierarchical star cabling was an efficient alternative to traditionalbus topologies.andP;  Based on the distributed cable plan IBM Corp. introduced in1984, the hierarchical star topology calls for the data wire center to be inthe phone wiring closet.andM;Under the IBM plan, data wires radiate from the wiring closet to theworkstations, and each wiring closet in turn is connected to other wiringclosets by a backbone cable.andM;&quot;The cabling IBM would like you to run from wire closets to workstations istwisted-pair wiring.andP;  but not twisted-pair like your phone wire,&quot; Groarksaid.andP;  &quot;IBM's recommendation is for a very sophisticated, very expensiveshielded twisted-pair wire.&quot;andM;On the backbone, IBM recommends either fiber-optic or coaxial cable betweenthe wiring closets.andM;For Ethernet LANs, which represent &quot;anywhere from 60 percent to 80 percent&quot;of federal LANs, telephone wire will work as well as the more expensiveshielded, twisted-pair wire, a representative of Synoptics CommunicationsInc., Alexandria, Va., told the group.andM;&quot;Cable engineering has advanced to the point where you don't need heavy,double-graded, shielded cabling,&quot; said Brian Sheffer.andP;  No speed is lost inrunning in 10-megabit/sec Ethernet protocols over unshielded, twisted-pairwire in comparison with speed results over thick coaxial cable, the usualEthernet medium.andP;  Another speaker went further, suggesting that Ethernetprotocols actually run better on unshielded twisted-pair wiring, becauseshielding causes unwanted impedance.andM;&quot;In the Ethernet community, the unshielded is preferred to shieldedtwisted-pair,&quot; said Timothy S. Dennison, a network engineer with CabletronSystems Inc., Chantilly, Va.andM;One of the biggest problems users have with LAN cabling is in moving andadding users.andP;  One advantage of the shared wiring closet and patch panelRJ-45 cabling is that &quot;the telephone service people can manage the physicalcable,&quot; Sheffer said.andM;Noise is not a problem in offices where standard wiring practices have beenfollowed, he said.andM;Sheffer said electromagnetic inference is relative to distance.andP;  He said itis not a problem within the 100-meter maximum distance between workstationsthat is specified by the yet-unpublished 10Base-T standard for unshielded,twisted-pair wiring.andP;  A committee of the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers is expected to complete its work on the standard thisyear.andM;Fiber-optic cable, especially for backbone connections between wiring closetsor hubs on the network, can handle the higher-bandwidth services and greatercoverage demanded by large LAN users, said Dennison of Cabletron Systems.andM;Wiring technicians can be trained in two or three days to install fiber andprovide good-quality connections, Dennison said.andM;&quot;The equipment for putting the connectors on has been cost-restrictive in thepast,&quot; but today those costs have dropped, he said.andM;Dennison recommended using bayonet connectors for fiber LANs.andP;  He said thescrew-on SMA-type provides a less reliable connection.andP;  Temperaturedifferences between the fiber and the connector can cause uneven expansionthat weakens the connection, allowing a large portion of the signal to belost, he said.andM;Claims that fiber-optic cable is untappable are untrue, Dennison said.andP;  Witha $2,000 box, as he called it, a person can tap your fiber network, and youwould never know it had happened, he said.andM;&quot;[The box] bends the fiber enough to get refraction out of it, and you canactually read data, without causing any disruption,&quot; he said.andM;With many buildings reaching the end of their official useful life, DefenseDepartment agencies and others are looking for the best cable for their needswhen they have to prewire new buildings.andM;For those users, Dennison recommended wiring for the not-too-distant futurewhen 100-megabit fiber-optic products &quot;become available and reasonablypriced.&quot;andM;Dennison recommended that agencies put in four strands of fiber.andP;  &quot;Althoughyou'll only use two now, the Fiber Distributed Data Interface specificationis a counter-rotating ring and requires four fibers -- then you areautomatically ready to go up to the FDDI spec,c he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
