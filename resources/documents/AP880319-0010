It's another example of wherePresident Reagan is exaggerating the situation for his ownpurposes,'' former President Jimmy Carter said of the militaryaction while addressing the Southern University Conference, ameeting of university presidents.   In Minneapolis, several hundred protesters marched on a militaryrecruitment building Friday evening, and some hurled bowling balls,eggs and paint, broke four windows and ripped up a uniformedmannequin. Scuffles broke out between protesters andcounterdemonstrators, but there were no arrests or injuries, policesaid.   More than 250 people were arrested in San Francisco, 60 inChicago and one in Boston on the second day of protests, policesaid. Twenty-four people were arrested for blocking traffic infront of the White House, and 25 were arrested in Los Angeles whenthey refused to leave a federal office building when it closed forthe day.   About 50 protesters were arrested Thursday, the day 3,200soldiers were sent to Honduras in what the White House called a``measured response'' to Nicaraguan forces reportedly crossing theborder into Honduras.   Friday's arrests in San Francisco came when a crowd of 500chanting people blocked traffic and the entrance to the FederalBuilding. Helmeted police at one point blocked a street, reroutingrush-hour traffic.   At least half a dozen violent confrontations erupted whendemonstrators tried to grab police equipment, including batons.Some officers lashed back, jamming batons in demonstrators'stomachs and chests.   Those arrested were handcuffed with plastic ties, photographedand booked on the street, then taken to the Hall of Justice. Policesaid they would be cited by federal authorities and released.   Many of those arrested had sat down across the entire width ofthe street outside the building and refused to move after policeordered them to disperse. Among them were several elderly people, awoman with a sleeping infant on her back and well-dressed businesspeople.   About 600 protesters participated in another boisterous marchthrough San Francisco streets in the evening. The demonstrators,representing the gay community, said the money spent on sendingtroops would be better spent on AIDS research.   In Minneapolis, Deputy Police Chief David Dubrotka said policebelieved that arrests would have just inflamed the situation.   Col. Curtis Burg, a recruiter at the office that was damaged,said it would be closed temporarily for repairs. ``I think most ofthem (the protesters) are radical, ignorant people who don't knowany better,'' he said.   On a smaller scale, about 15 people paraded quietly in front ofthe federal building in Orlando, Fla. Spokeswoman Beth Rapps saidthe U.S. military presence in Honduras was an attempt by the Reaganadministration to persuade Congress to continue financial supportto the Contras fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   ``We should support the people down there by reversing ourpolicies and provide aid to the poor and the hungry rather than theContras,'' she said.   It was a different story in the Nicaraguan immigrant enclave ofSweetwater, Fla., where more than 100 people marched with signssupporting U.S. policy and mutilated an effigy of NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega.   In Washington, D.C., 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside theWhite House, said police Officer Tom Randolph. Twenty-four peoplewere arrested after the protest spilled into Pennsylvania Avenue.They were to have been fined $50 for blocking traffic, but that wascut to $25 for disorderly conduct because they didn't use avehicle, Randolph said.   The Chicago arrests, on misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges,came after demonstrators pasted 8{-by-11-inch orange stickers onfirst-floor windows at the downtown federal building and sat inintersections, police said. Many of the stickers boreskull-and-crossbone symbols and the message ``Stop U.S.intervention in Central America.''   The 400 protesters also chanted ``Reagan sent the troops today,get them out is what we say.''   ``Bring the troops home. No Contra aid, no war,'' the Bostonprotesters chanted.   About 80 people rallied in front of a military recruiting centerin Boston, blocking two lanes of traffic and interrupting themorning rush hour, and about 10 of them occupied the recruitingcenter peacefully while the rest of the demonstration broke up,police said.   ``I believe our actions in Central America are wrong,'' saidLenore Azaroff, 22, of Somerville, Mass. ``I believe sending troopsto Honduras is the first step to another Vietnam.''   The demonstrators in the recruiting center were dragged outsideat midafternoon without being charged and the doors were closedbehind them, said Robert Dove, a spokesman for the Pledge ofResistance, which sponsored the rally. ``Everybody's gone home,''said a man who answered the phone in the Navy section of thebuilding and wouldn't give his name.   About 200 people gathered at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine,and at Augusta, Maine, about 15 people quietly gathered at MemorialCircle where the city's busiest streets converge, holding up signssaying ``Stop the Reagan War Machine'' and ``U.S. Troops Out ofHonduras.''   In Sioux Falls, S.D., about 70 people opposed to the sending oftroops to Honduras demonstrated outside the main post office whileabout 15 people supporting the Reagan administration shouted tauntsthrough bullhorns. Three people were arrested.   In Seattle, about 40 cars circled the federal building to showtheir opposition to the troop movement, jamming streets for aboutan hour. The protest also attracted about 100 people on foot. InProvidence, R.I., a protest attracted about 60 demonstrators.</TEXT></DOC>
