Exceptfor the subject area of disposal of excess spoil on preexisting benches,the proposed amendments generally respond to U.S. district court and courtof appeals decisions.In the subject area of values incompatible with surface coal mining operations,the rule would amend the definition of <T3>no significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatiblewith surface coal mining operations </T3>by removing the phrase ``beyondan operators ability to repair.'' This would eliminate reclaimability asa criterion in determining compatibility with surface coal mining operations.In the subject area of AOC variances, the rule would revise regulationsgoverning permits incorporating variances from AOC restoration requirementsto limit their application to steep slope mining.In the subject area of disposal of excess spoil on preexisting benches,the rule would revise regulations governing the disposal of excess spoilon preexisting benches to conform them with the general requirements forbackfilling and grading.In the subject area of coal mine waste, the rule would revise the generalrequirements governing the disposal of coal mine waste to add to the existingrequirement that it be placed in a controlled manner the additional requirementthat it be hauled or conveyed. This addition would prohibit the end orside dumping of coal mine waste. Also in this subject area, the rule wouldremove regulations requiring the handling of hazardous noncoal mine wastein accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its implementingregulations.Finally, in the subject area of contemporaneous reclamation/backfillingand grading, the rule would add new regulations reinstituting backfillingand grading time and distance requirements. It would require the completionof backfilling and grading within a certain time or distance followingcoal removal, or under a schedule established by the regulatory authority.Also in this subject area, the rule would define <T3>thin overburden </T3>and <T3>thick overburden </T3>using general standards relating to the restorationof AOC, and would establish performance standards governing the backfillingand grading of thin and thick overburden.Any previous suspensions of these and related regulations that would beobviated by these amendments would be removed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2><T3>Written Comments: </T3>OSMRE will accept written comments on the proposedrule until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 30, 1988.<T3>Public Hearings: </T3>Upon request, OSMRE will hold public hearingson the proposed rule in Washington, DC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Denver,Colorado, at 9:30 a.m. local time.

Background</ITAG>Section 201(c)(2) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of1977 (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(2), directs the Secretary ofthe Interior (the Secretary), acting through the Office of Surface MiningReclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), to ``publish and promulgate such rulesand regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisionsof this Act.'' Section 501(b) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1251(b), directs theSecretary to ``promulgate and publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>regulations covering a permanent regulatory procedurefor surface coal mining and reclamation operations performance standards* * * '' The resulting OSMRE regulations are codified at 30 CFR ChapterVII.This proposed rule concerns five general subject areas in Chapter VII.These subject areas have been grouped together in this combined rule foradministrative convenience. The pertinent legislative, regulatory and litigationbackground of each proposed section in these subject areas is discussedin turn under the following general headings, with the affected sectionslisted in parentheses.For convenience, where the discussion concerns similar sections in Part816, which applies to surface mining activities, and Part 817, which appliesto underground mining activities, these sections are cited together inthe heading as andSection;andSection; 816.[ ]/817.[ ], but in most cases onlyPart 816 is discussed in the text. In such cases the discussion appliesequally to Parts 816 and 817 unless otherwise noted.A. Values Incompatible with Surface Coal Mining Operations (andSection; 761.5)Section 522(e)(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1272(e)(2), with certain exceptions,prohibits surface coal mining operations ``on any Federal lands withinthe boundaries of any national forest [unless] the Secretary finds thatthere are <T3>no significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values </T3>whichmay be <T3>incompatible with </T3>such <T3>surface </T3>[<T3>coal</T3>] <T3>mining operations </T3>* * *'' (Emphasis added). The correspondingOSMRE permanent program regulation appears at 30 CFR 761.11(b).In implementing this requirement, the 1979 OSMRE regulations at 30 CFR761.5 defined the emphasized language in section 522(e)(2) in part to mean:``[T]hose significant values which could be damaged by, and are not capableof existing together with, surface coal mining operations because of theundesirable effects mining would have on those values, either on the areaincluded in the permit application or on off-site areas which could beaffected by mining. * * *'' 44 FR 15341 (March 13, 1979).On June 10, 1982 (47 FR 25278) OSMRE proposed, and on September 3, 1983(48 FR 41312) OSMRE promulgated, a rule revising the 1979 definition. Therevised definition dropped the introductory term ``<T3>no</T3>'' as unnecessary, changed the phrase ``significant values''to ``values to be evaluated for their significance,'' changed the term``offsite areas which could be affected by mining'' to ``affected areas,''and of particular relevance to this proposed rule, inserted after the word``damage'' the phrase ``beyond an operator's ability to repair or restore.''Thus, following revision in 1983 the corresponding portion of the definitionread: <T3>``Significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatiblewith surface coal mining operations </T3>means those values to be evaluatedfor their significance which could be damaged beyond an operator's abilityto repair or restore by, and are not capable of existing together with,surface coal mining operations because of the undesirable effects miningwould have on those values, either on the area included in the permit applicationor on other affected areas.'' 30 CFR 761.5 (1983).This revised definition was challenged by the citizen and environmentalplaintiffs in <T3>In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation </T3>(<T3>In re Permanent II (Round III)), </T3>620 F. Supp. 1519 at 1556-57(D.D.C. July 15, 1985). The challengers contended that the definition wascontrary to the Act because under it mining could be permitted in nationalforests as long as reclamation was possible. The U.S. District Court forthe District of Columbia agreed with this contention and remanded the definition.<T3>Id</T3>. at 1557. On November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952) OSMRE suspendedthe definition ``insofar as the listed values are evaluated for compatibilitysolely in terms of reclaimability.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 41960-41961.OSMRE appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit affirmed the district court ruling. <T3>NWF v. Hodel,</T3> No. 84-5743, slip op. at 116-121 (DC Cir. January29, 1988). Like the district court, the court of appeals ruled that therevised regulation was contrary to the intent of the Congress and to elementaryprinciples of statutory construction.OSMRE now proposes to revise the andSection; 761.5 definition of <T3>significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatiblewith surface coal mining operations</T3> in conformance with the districtcourt and court of appeals decisions.B. AOC Variances (andSection;andSection; 785.16 and 816.133(d)/817.133(d))Section 515(b)(3) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(3), generally requires``all surface coal mining and reclamation operations * * * to * * * compact* * * and grade in order to restore the approximate original contour ofthe land with all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions eliminated ** *.'' For steep slope mining, section 515(d)(2), 30 U.S.C. 1265(d)(2),imposes an additional requirement for ``[c]omplete backfilling with spoilmaterial * * * to cover completely the highwall and return the site tothe approximate original contour * * *.'' The term <T3>approximate original contour</T3> (AOC), as used in these sections,is defined in section 701(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1291(2), and in theregulations at 30 CFR 701.5. For the text of the definition, which is notessential to an understanding of this portion of the proposed rule, seethe subsequent heading, E. Contemporaneous Reclamation/Backfilling andGrading.Sections 515(e)(1) through (e)(6) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(e)(1) through(e)(6), allow regulatory authorities to permit variances from AOC undercertain circumstances. Section 515(e)(1) allows State regulatory programs,and requires Federal regulatory programs, to include procedures for permittingvariances for the purposes set forth in section 515(e)(3). Section 515(e)(2)explicitly allows the regulatory authority to grant a variance from thesteep-slope requirement of section 515(d)(2).Accordingly, on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15372) OSMRE promulgated at 30 CFR785.16 a regulation which authorized the regulatory authority to granta variance from AOC for nonmountaintop removal, steep slope mining. Thisregulation was challenged by the coal industry in <T3>In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation </T3>(<T3>In re Permanent I</T3>), No. 79-1144, slip op. at 69-70 (D.D.C. February26, 1980), as unduly restrictive.In upholding the andSection; 785.16 limitation of AOC variances to steepslop mining, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <T3>In re Permanent I </T3>said: ``Section 515(e) of the Act contains onevariance provision: it applies to steep slopes. Rather than calling fora general variance mechanism, section 515(e)(1) establishes the right toapply for a variance * * *. Section 515(e)(2) restricts the variance applicationto the contour restoration requirements of subsection 515(d)(2) (steepslopes). Whatever ambiguity may be read into section 515 is dispelled uponexamination of the legislative history.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 69-70.Subsequently, OSMRE reconsidered the legislative history of the Act andconcluded ``that the section allowing for AOC variances was not limitedto steep slope operations.'' 48 FR 39900 (September 1, 1983). Accordingly,OSMRE expanded the coverage of andSection; 785.16 to permit variances fromAOC on both steep and non-steep slope terrain. 48 FR 39892 (September 1,1983), as amended at 48 FR 44780 (September 30, 1983). At the same time(48 FR 39892), OSMRE revised its regulations governing postmining landuse to include at 30 CFR 816.133(d) criteria for permitting variances inaccordance with revised andSection; 785.16. OSMRE set out its rationale forthese revisions in a detailed analysis of the legislative history of section515(e), and of the issues considered by the district court in <T3>In re Permanent I.</T3> 48 FR 39899-900.These revised regulations were challenged by the citizen and environmentalplaintiffs in <T3>In re Permanent II (Round III), </T3>620 F. Supp. at 1574-1578. Inresponse, the district court remanded the revised regulations ``as inconsistentwith law to the extent they permit[ted] a variance beyond the variancefor steep slopes embodied in section 515(e)(2) [of the Act].'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 1577-78.On November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952), OSMRE suspended andSection;andSection;785.16 and 816.133(d) insofar as they authorized any variance from AOCoutside a steep slope area. The district court remand was appealed by thecoal industry, and affirmed by the court of appeals in <T3>NWF</T3> v. <T3>Hodel.</T3> Slip op. at 141-146. In affirming the district court, thecourt of appeals ``rel[ied] on the text of section 515(e)(2), which specificallystates that variances may be granted from the AOC requirements of section515(d)(2), the steep slope mining provision; it does not, as enacted, statethat non-steep slope mining AOC requirements may be waived or excused,and neither does it reference section 515(b)(3), the general AOC provision.''<T3>Id.</T3> at 145. The court of appeals found nothing in the legislativehistory that would change its reading of section 515(e). <T3>Id.</T3> at 146.OSMRE now proposes to revise andSection; 785.16, and to remove the suspensionof that section and of andSection;andSection; 816.133(d) and 817.133(d), inconformance with the district court and court of appeals decisions.C. Disposal of Excess Spoil on Preexisting Benches (andSection;andSection;816.74/817.74)Section 515(b)(22) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(22), specifies generalperformance standards for the placement of excess spoil material resultingfrom surface coal mining and reclamation activities. Section 516(b)(10)of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1266(b)(10), authorizes similar performance standardsfor underground mining activities, with ``such modifications as are necessaryto accommodate the distinct difference between surface and undergroundcoal mining.''The existing OSMRE permanent program regulations implementing these statutoryperformance standards appear at 30 CFR 816.71 through 816.74 for surfacemining activities. In particular, andSection; 816.74, which is affected bythis proposed rule, governs the disposal of excess spoil on preexistingbenches.The original OSMRE permanent program regulations governing the disposalof excess spoil appeared at 30 CFR 816.71 through 816.74 (1979). These1979 regulations did not provide specifically for the disposal of excessspoil on preexisting benches.Regulations to allow the disposal of excess spoil on preexisting bencheswere proposed by OSMRE on May 16, 1980 (45 FR 32331). As a result of publiccomment, these regulations were reproposed in substantially different formon July 20, 1981 (46 FR 37283). Final regulations at 30 CFR 816.75 werepromulgated on April 29, 1982 (46 FR 18553).On June 8, 1982 (47 FR 24954), as part of an overall revision of its regulationsgoverning the disposal of excess spoil, OSMRE proposed to revise andSection;816.75. The final revised and renumbered regulations at 30 CFR 816.74 werepromulgated on July 29, 1983 (48 FR 32910). Paragraphs (a) through (d)of the revised regulations were essentially the same as the 1982 regulations,and a new paragraph (e) was added to allow in certain circumstances thedisposal of excess spoil from an upper actively-mined bench to a lowerpreexisting bench by means of gravity transport.In July 1986, OSMRE released for public review and comment the final draftof a study titled, ``Encouraging Abandoned Mine Reclamation Via Remining:A Federal, State and Industry Initiative.'' On September 23, 1986, OSMREheld a public meeting in Washington, DC, to discuss the initiatives identifiedin this draft study. Copies of the draft study and a transcript of thepublic meeting have been placed in the administrative record for this rule.One of the initiatives identified in the draft study and discussed at thepublic meeting was ``Reclaiming Abandoned Mine Lands with Excess Spoil.''A sub-issue within this initiative was the disposal of excess spoil onpreexisting benches, and, particularly, whether the requirements for suchdisposal were excessive as compared to the general requirements for backfillingand grading. Both in written comments and orally at the public meeting,commenters pointed out that the differences in these requirements wereinconsistent with the similar geologic and engineering characteristicsof preexisting and active-mining benches.In response to these comments, OSMRE proposes to revise andSection;andSection;816.74/817.74 to conform their requirements for disposal of excess spoilon preexisting benches with the backfilling and grading requirements ofandSection;andSection; 816.102/817.102.D. Coal Mine Waste (andSection;andSection; 816.81/817.81 and 816.89/817.89)Recognizing the problems posed by improper disposal of coal waste, theCongress included in the Act a number of performance standards governingwaste disposal. These performance standards appear in section 515 of theAct, 30 U.S.C. 1265, for surface mining activities, and in section 516of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1266, for underground mining activities.To implement these statutory performance standards, the 1979 permanentprogram included at 30 CFR 701.5 a definition of <T3>coal processing waste, </T3>and at 30 CFR 816.81 to 816.93 (44 FR 15395and 15422 (March 13, 1979)), regulations governing the disposal of coalmine waste. Several changes in the 1979 regulations, which are not otherwiserelevant to this discussion but are noted for completeness, were made onAugust 18, 1980 (45 FR 54753), and on November 20, 1980 (45 FR 76932).On September 26, 1983 (40 FR 44006) OSMRE promulgated at 30 CFR 701.5 arevised definition of <T3>coal processing waste, </T3>and new definitions of <T3>coal mine waste, impounding structure, </T3>and <T3>refuse pile. </T3>At the same time (40 FR 44006), OSMRE promulgatedat 30 CFR 816.81, 816.83, 816.87 and 816.89, a comprehensive revision ofthe 1979 regulations. These new regulations were challenged in <T3>In re Permanent II (Round III). </T3>620 F. Supp. at 1534-1538.<T3>In re Permanent II (Round III) </T3>involved two coal waste issuesthat are dealt with by this rule: (1) Controlled transport of coal waste;and (2) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations on hazardouswastes.1. Controlled Transport of Coal Waste (andSection;andSection; 816.81(a)/817.81(a))In <T3>In re Permanent II (Round III) </T3>the district court rejected andSection;andSection;816.81(a)/817.81(a) as arbitrary and capricious to the extent they allowedend or side dumping of coal, a practice in hilly mining areas of placingmaterial at a disposal site by means of gravity. 620 F. Supp. at 1534-1535.On November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952), OSMRE suspended andSection;andSection;816.81(a)/817.81(a) insofar as they allowed end or side dumping of coalmine waste. OSMRE now proposes to amend these sections, and to remove theirsuspension, in conformance with the district court decision.2. EPA Regulations on Hazardous Wastes (andSection;andSection; 816.89(d)/817.89(d))Section 816.89(d) of the 1983 regulations required that ``any noncoal minewaste defined as `hazardous' under section 3001 of the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-580, as amended) and 40 CFR Part 261shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of Subtitle C of RCRAand any implementing regulations.'' 48 FR 44006, 44030 and 44032 (September26, 1983). As OSMRE noted in the preamble to the final rule, this was doneat the suggestion of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). <T3>Id. </T3>at 44027.In <T3>In re Permanent II (Round III), </T3>620 F. Supp. at 1538, the coalindustry challenged this section of the regulations, which the districtcourt remanded for lack of adequate notice and comment. The district courtsaid:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Industry challenges this rule because it contends that Congressgave the Secretary exclusive responsibility to regulate every kind of wasteat coal mines in SMCRA permits, and expressly provided that EPA's regulationsfor hazardous wastes under RCRA shall not be applied to coal mines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The court need not spend much time detailing the statutory analysisbecause it concludes that the rule was promulgated without adequate noticeand comment under the APA [(Administrative Procedure Act)] * * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The Secretary * * * did not respond to the Industry's APA challenge,but instead attempted to explain that the rule neither broadens nor diminishesthe Secretary's rules on the disposal of noncoal waste. Industry takesa vastly different view of the effect of the regulation, and makes a lengthyargument that has nowhere been considered by the Secretary prior to thislitigation. Second, Industry is able to point to legal and practical complicationsthat result from the rules.'' <T3>Id.</T3></ITAG>On November 20, 1986 (51 FR 41952), OSMRE suspended andSection;andSection;816.89(d)/817.89(d). OSMRE now proposes to remove these sections from itsregulations in conformance with the district court decision.E. Contemporaneous Reclamation/Backfilling and Grading (andSection;andSection;816.100, 816.101, 816.104(a) and 816.105(a))Section 515(b)(16) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(16), provides for generalperformance standards to require suface coal mining and reclamation operationsto ``insure that all reclamation efforts proceed in an environmentallysound manner and as contemporaneously as practicable with [such operations].''In addition, section 515(b)(3) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b)(3), with twoexemptions, provides for general performance standards requiring that ``allsurface coal mining operations backfill, compact * * * and grade in orderto restore the approximate original contour of the land with all highwalls,spoil piles, and depressions eliminated. * * *''The phrase <T3>approximate original contour </T3>(AOC) is defined in section 701(2)of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1291(2), and 30 CFR 701.5 generally to mean ``thatsurface configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the minedarea so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads,closely resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior tomining and blends into and complements the drainage pattern of the surroundingterrain. * * *''The previously noted exemptions to the AOC restoration requirements ofsection 515(b)(3) pertain to operations involving either ``thin'' or ``thick''overburden. With respect to thin overburden, section 515(b)(3) provides``[t]hat in surface coal mining which is carried out at the same locationover a substantial period of time where the operation transects the coaldeposit, and the thickness of the coal deposits relative to the volumeof the overburden is large and where the operator demonstrates that theoverburden and other spoil and waste materials at a particular point inthe permit area or otherwise available from the entire permit area is insufficient,giving due consideration to volumetric expansion, to restore the approximateoriginal contour, the operator, at a minimum, shall backfill, grade, andcompact (where advisable) using all available overburden and other spoiland waste materials to attain the lowest practicable grade but not morethan the angle of repose, to provide adequate drainage and to cover allacid-forming and other toxic materials, in order to achieve an ecologicallysound land use compatible with the surrounding region.''With respect to thick overburden, section 515(b)(3) provides ``[t]hat insurface coal mining where the volume of overburden is large relative tothe thickness of the coal deposit and where the operator demonstrates thatdue to volumetric expansion the amount of overburden and other spoil andwaste materials removed in the course of the mining operations are morethan sufficient to restore the approximate original contour, the operatorshall after restoring the approximate contour, backfill, grade, and compact(where advisable) the excess overburden and other spoil and waste materialsto attain the lowest grade but not more than the angle of repose, and tocover all acid-forming, and other toxic materials, in order to achievean ecologically sound land use compatible with the surrounding region andthat such overburden or spoil shall be shaped and graded in such a wayas to prevent slides, erosion, and water pollution and is revegetated inaccordance with the requirements of this Act.''The OSMRE permanent program promulgated on March 13, 1979 included regulationsgoverning contemporaneous reclamation for surface mining activities at30 CFR 816.100 (44 FR 15411), and backfilling and grading at 30 CFR 816.101,816.102, 816.104 and 816.105. 44 FR 15411-15413. Section 816.100 requiredreclamation efforts to occur as contemporaneously as practicable with miningoperations. Section 816.101 provided time and distance schedules as generalrequirements for backfilling and grading. Sections 816.104 and 816.105provided for the thin and thick overburden exemptions authorized by section515(b)(3) of the Act.On May 24, 1983 (48 FR 23356) OSMRE revised its regulations governing contemporaneousreclamation and backfilling and grading. The revision deleted andSection;816.101 from the regulations, and added to andSection; 816.100 a provisionauthorizing regulatory authorities to establish schedules for definingcontemporaneous reclamation. At the same time the numerical limits on thinand thick overburden that appeared in andSection;andSection; 816.104 and 816.105,<T3>i.e., </T3>plus or minus twenty percent, were deleted and replacedwith the statutory language. 48 FR 23355 (May 24, 1983).The 1983 regulations were challenged in <T3>In re Permanent Surface Mining Regulation </T3>(<T3>In re Permanent II (Round II)</T3>), 21 ERC 1724, 1744-1746 (D.D.C.October 1, 1984). As a result, the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia remanded the regulations governing contemporaneous reclamation(andSection; 816.100; 21 ERC at 1745-46), cut and fill terraces (andSection;816.102(g); 21 ERC at 1744-45), thin overburden (andSection; 816.104(a);21 ERC at 1746), and thick overburden (andSection; 816.105(a); 21 ERC at1746). Generally, the district court found that the remanded regulationslacked sufficient guidance to regulatory authorities beyond what was providedin the Act.OSMRE appealed the district court ruling, and the court of appeals in <T3>NWF v. Hodel </T3>affirmed the remand with respect to contemporaneousreclamation and thin and thick overburden, but reversed with respect tocut and fill terraces. Slip op. at 78-890.

Discussion of Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule includes a number of similar sections in Part 816, whichapplies to surface mining activities, and Part 817, which applies to undergroundmining activities. For convenience, these similar sections are cited togetherin the following headings as andSection;andSection;816.[]/817.[], but in mostcases only Party 816 is discussed in the text. In such cases the discussionapplies equally to Part 817 unless otherwise noted.A. Section 761.5_DefinitionsOSMRE proposes to revise its 30 CFR 761.5 definition of <T3>significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatiblewith surface coal mining operations.</T3> The revised definition wouldcomply with the court of appeals decision upholding the district courtremand of this definition. (See related discussion in II. Background, underthe heading, A. Value Incompatible with Surface Coal Mining Operations.)In conformance with those decisions, OSMRE proposes to delete from thedefinition the phrase ``beyond an operator's ability to repair or restore.''As the courts have ruled, the operator's ability to reclaim the land maynot be used as a criterion for determining compatibility under this definition.B. Section 785.16_Permits Incorporating Variances from AOC RestorationRequirements for Steep Slope Mining<ITAG tagnum="20">(For a related proposal, see the subsequent heading, I. Sections 816.133/817.133_AOCVariances)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section Heading</ITAG>OSMRE proposes to revise the section heading of 30 CFR 785.16 to includethe phrase ``for steep slope mining,'' and thus emphasize that this sectionauthorizes variances from approximate original contour (AOC) only for steepslope surface coal mining and reclamation operations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 785.16(a) </ITAG>Section 785.16 authorizes the regulatory authority to issue a permit whichincludes a variance from certain AOC restoration requirements. The districtcourt ruled, and the court of appeals agreed, that such a variance is authorizedby the Act only for steep slope mining. (See related dicussion in II. Background,under the heading, B. AOC Variances.) In accordance with these court decisions, OSMRE proposes to revise andSection;785.16(a) to limit the granting of AOC variances to ``steep slope surfacecoal mining and reclamation operations.'' The quoted phrase duplicatesthe corresponding wording of the 1979 regulation. OSMRE further proposes to remove the November 20, 1986, suspension of andSection;785.16, which the proposed revision would render superfluous. (See II.Background, regarding suspension). The remainder of andSection; 785.16 wouldremain unchanged. C. Sections 816.74/817.74_Disposal of Excess Spoil: Preexisting BenchesOSMRE proposes to revise andSection; 816.74 to conform its requirements forthe disposal of excess spoil on preexisting benches with the backfillingand grading requirements of 30 CFR 816.102. This proposal was promptedby public comment received in response to an OSMRE draft study on remininginitiatives and at a related public meeting. (See related discussion inII. Background, under the heading, C. Disposal of Excess Spoil on PreexistingBenches.) The proposed rule would redesignate andSection;andSection; 816.74(b), (c),(d) and (e) as andSection;andSection; 816.74(c), (d), (e) and (g), respectively;would revise andSection;andSection; 816.74(a) and (e); and would add new andSection;andSection;81.74(b) and (f). A discussion of each of these proposed changes followsunder separate subheadings for each paragraph of this section. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Sections 816.74(a)/817.74(a) </ITAG>OSMRE proposes to substitute for the existing references in andSection; 816.74(a)to the general requirements for the disposal of excess spoil, new referencesto the corresponding general requirements for backfilling and grading.Also, to account for difference in the existing and newly-referenced sections,OSMRE proposes to add to andSection; 816.74(a) a requirement that the affectedportion of the preexisting bench be permitted. A detailed explanation follows.Currently, andSection; 816.74(a) authorizes the regulatory authority to approvethe disposal of excess spoil through placement on preexisting benches ``providedthat all the standards set forth in andSection; 816.71(a), (b)(1) [and] (d)through (i) * * * are met.'' The referenced andSection; 816.71 contains generalrequirements for the disposal of excess spoil.The proposed rule would replace the current references to andSection; 816.71with references to andSection; 816.102 (c), (e) through (h), and (j). Section816.102 contains the backfilling and grading counterparts to the excessspoil disposal regulations in andSection; 816.71. This substitution wouldconform the requirements for the disposal of excess spoil on a preexistingbench with the existing requirements for the backfilling and grading ofan active mining bench. As explained subsequently in greater detail, OSMREproposes to do this in recognition of the similar characteristics of preexistingand active mining benches.Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(a) requires that the disposal ofexcess spoil occur ``within the permit area.'' The substituted paragraphsof andSection; 816.102 do not explicitly refer to the permit area. To accountfor this difference, proposed andSection; 816.74(a) would explicitly requirethat ``the affected portion of the preexisting bench is permitted.'' Underthis provision, the affected portion of the preexisting bench could beeither within the permit area where the excess spoil was generated, orin another permit area.Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(a) also covers adverse effects onsurface and groundwater, mass stability and movement, and the suitabilityof the final fill for reclamation and revegetation. The proposed rule addresseseffects on surface and ground water by reference to andSection;andSection;816.102 (c), (e) through (h), and (j), and by the addition of andSection;816.74(e)(3). (See subsequent discussion of andSection; 816.74(e)(3).)The proposed rule addresses effects on mass stability and movement by referenceto andSection;andSection; 816.102 (c), (e), (g) and (j), and by the additionof andSection; 816.74(e)(4). (See subsequent discussion of andSection; 816.74(e)(4).)The suitability of the final fill for reclamation and revegetation areaddressed in the proposed rule by reference to andSection; 816.102 (e) through(h), and (j).Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(b)(1) requires that excess spoilfill and appurtenant structures be designed using current, prudent engineeringpractices; meet any design criteria established by the regulatory authority;and be certified by a qualified registered professional engineer. OSMREproposes to delete from andSection; 816.74(a) the reference to andSection;816.71(b)(1) because existing andSection; 816.74(c), which requires that``[t]he fill shall be designed, using current, prudent engineering practices,''itself provides sufficient design standards. Note, however, that underreferenced andSection; 816.102(e), which itself references 30 CFR 816.81,the requirement of andSection; 816.81(c) for design certification would applyto any fill constructed on a preexisting bench using coal processing wasteor underground development waste.Currently-referenced andSection;andSection; 816.71 (d) and (e)(2) require foundationanalysis, keyway cuts, and rock toe buttresses, and prescribe spoil placementand the thickness of spoil lifts. These measures are appropriate whereexcess spoil is disposed of on sloping ground and there is a need to ensurestability of the fill structure. Corresponding requirements do not appearin andSection; 816.102 since backfilling and grading operations typicallyare conducted on relatively flat benches where these special measures arenot needed to ensure stability. Because preexisting benches are similarto active contour mining benches that are regulated under andSection; 816.102,the reference to the requirements of andSection;andSection; 816.71 (d) and(e)(2) was deleted from the proposed rule.Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(e)(1) provides for the removal ofvegetative and organic materials prior to the placement of excess spoil;the removal, segregation, storage and redistribution of topsoil; and theuse of organic material as mulch or as an additive to topsoil. Proposednew andSection; 816.74(b) contains corresponding requirements. (See subsequentdiscussion of andSection; 816.74(b).)Currently-referenced andSection;andSection; 816.71(e) (3), (4) and (5) addressfinal fill configuration and terraces, prohibit permanent impoundments,authorize small depressions, and require adequate covering of acid-, toxic-formingand combustible materials. Proposed andSection; 816.74(a) substitutes referencesto andSection; 816.102(f) through (h), which contain corresponding requirements.Although the rule would not explicitly prohibit permanent impoundments,andSection; 816.74(a) does not reference andSection; 816.102(i), which authorizespermanent impoundments in certain circumstances, and the regulatory authoritywould not be authorized to allow permanent impoundments on preexistingbenches.Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(f) addresses drainage control, includingdiversions and underdrains. Deleting the reference to andSection; 816.71(f),proposed new andSection; 816.74(e)(4) would require that ``[t]he preexistingbench shall be backfilled and graded to * * * [p]revent water infiltrationinto the backfill from springs, water courses, or seeps, and ensure stability.''(See subsequent discussion of andSection; 816.74(e)(4).)Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(g) addresses surface area stabilization,erosion and revegetation. Proposed andSection; 816.74(a) substitutes a referenceto andSection; 816.102(j), the backfilling and grading counterpart in termsof stabilization and erosion. In addition, the last sentence of andSection;816.71(g) would be replicated as new andSection; 816.74(f) to require that``[a]ll disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not riprappedor otherwise protected, shall be revegetated upon completion of construction.''(See subsequent discussion of andSection; 816.74(f).)Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(h) addresses periodic inspectionsof excess spoil fill structures during construction. OSMRE proposes todelete this requirement from andSection; 816.74 since the backfilling andgrading regulations at andSection; 816.102 do not require these inspections.Because a preexisting bench provides a relatively flat surface, the designand construction of fill structures on preexisting benches are not as criticalas for structures regulated under andSection; 816.71, and inspections duringconstruction are not necessary. Note, however, that under referenced andSection;816.102(e), which itself references 30 CFR 816.83, the requirement of andSection;816.83(d) for design inspection during construction would apply to anyfill constructed on a preexisting bench using coal processing waste orunderground development waste.Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(i) addresses the disposal of coalmine waste in excess spoil fills. Proposed andSection; 816.74(a) substitutesa reference to andSection; 816.102(e), the backfilling and grading counterpart.While andSection; 816.71(i) requires disposal of coal mine waste only inaccordance with andSection; 816.83, andSection; 816.102(e) requires disposalin accordance with both andSection;andSection; 816.81 <T3>and</T3> 816.83, and thus is more inclusive. While andSection; 816.71(i)limits disposal to coal mine waste that is nontoxic and nonacid forming,proposed andSection; 816.74 would allow the disposal of such materials aslong as they were covered adequately, as provided in referenced andSection;816.102(f).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sections 816.74(b)/817.74(b)</ITAG>Currently-referenced andSection; 816.71(e)(1) addresses the removal of vegetativeand organic materials from the disposal area, and the removal, segregation,storage and the redistribution of topsoil. In place of this reference,proposed new andSection; 816.74(b) would require that ``[a]ll vegetationshall be removed from the affected portion of the preexisting bench priorto placement of the excess spoil,'' would cross-reference the permanentprogram topsoil performance standards at 30 CFR 816.22, and would allowthe use of topsoil substitutes in accordance with andSection; 812.22(b) whereinsufficient topsoil was available on the preexisting bench.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Sections 816.74(c)/817.74(c)</ITAG>Existing andSection; 816.74(b) would be redesignated as proposed andSection;816.74(c).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Sections 816.74(d)/817.74(d)</ITAG>Existing andSection; 816.74(c) would be redesignated as proposed andSection;816.74(d).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Sections 816.74(e)/817.74(e)</ITAG>Existing andSection; 816.74(d) (1) and (2) require that the preexisting benchbe backfilled and graded to achieve the most moderate slope possible whichdoes not exceed the angle of repose, and to eliminate the highwall to themaximum extent technically practical. Only minor editorial revisions areproposed for the corresponding redesignated andSection;andSection; 816.74(e)(1) and (2).Proposed new andSection; 816.74(e)(3) would require that the preexistingbench be backfilled and graded to ``[m]inimize erosion and water pollutionboth on and off the site.'' This replicates the backfilling and gradingprovision at andSection; 816.102(a)(4), which is not referenced by the rule.This requirement, in conjunction with other previously discussed provisions,would provide the requisite hydrologic balance protection.Proposed new andSection; 816.74(e)(4) would require that the preexistingbench be backfilled and graded to ``[p]revent water infiltration into thebackfill from springs, water courses, or seeps, and ensure stability.''This corresponds with andSection; 816.71(f), which currently is referencedby existing andSection; 816.74(a).

Sections 816.74(f)/817.74(f)</ITAG>Proposed new andSection; 816.74(f) would require that ``[a]ll disturbed areas,including diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected,shall be revegetated upon completion of construction.'' This replicatesthe last sentence of andSection; 816.71(g), which currently is referencedby andSection; 816.74(a). (See preceding discussion of andSection; 816.74(a).)<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Sections 816.74(g)/817.74(g)</ITAG>Existing andSection; 816.74(e) would be redesignated as proposed andSection;816.74(g).D. Sections 816.81/817.81_Coal Mine Waste: General RequirementsThis rule would amend andSection; 816.81 in response to the district courtdecision concerning end or side dumping of coal mine waste. (See relateddiscussion in II. Background, under the heading, D.1. Controlled Transportof Coal Waste.) As previously noted, the district court said that OSMREwas not required to prohibit end or side dumping, but need only explainwhy this practice was reasonable. Nevertheless, OSMRE proposes to reintroduceinto andSection; 816.81 the placement method of ``hauled or conveyed'' asit appeared prior to the 1983 rule, and thus to prohibit the final placementof coal mine waste by end or side dumping, consistent with the discussionof this issue in the preamble to the 1979 rule at 44 FR 15209-10 (March13, 1979).OSMRE continues to maintain, as it did in the preamble to the 1983 rule(48 FR 44011), that the controlled gravity placement of coal mine wasteis not inconsistent with the Act, and that the legislative history of theAct does not indicate that the Congress intended to regulate the meansof transporting coal mine waste to the disposal site.The practice of transporting coal mine waste through methods other thandirect hauling is well documented in the technical literature. (See, forexample, ``Engineering and Design Manual_Coal Refuse Disposal Facilities,''pp. 8.22-8.75, by E. D'Appolonia Consulting Engineers for the Mine Safetyand Health Administration.) These methods include conveyor belts and tramwaysand particularly useful in mountainous terrain where haul road constructionis difficult, or where steep grades greatly decrease the efficiency ofindividual hauling units. (See <T3>id.</T3> at p. 8.45; and ``Pit Slope Manual,'' ``Chapter 9: Waste Embankments,''p. 96, by the Canada Center for Mineral and Energy Technology.)However, OSMRE is aware of the dangers associated with the end or sidedumping of coal mine waste, and of the need for placement in a controlledmanner. Thus, the requirement of proposed andSection; 816.81 that ``[c]oalmine waste shall be hauled or conveyed and placed in a controlled manner''would preclude final placement of material by means of gravity throughend or side dumping.E. Sections 816.89(d)/817.89(d)_EPA Regulations on Hazardous WastesThe district court, without considering the merits of andSection; 816.89(d),concluded that it was promulgated without adequate notice and comment asrequired by the Administrative Procedure Act. (See related discussion inII. Background, under the heading, D.2. EPA Regulations on Hazardous Wastes.)OSMRE proposes to remove andSection; 816.89(d) as superfluous because allnoncoal mine waste defined as ``hazardous'' under section 3001 of the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), P.L. 94-580, as amended, and 40 CFRPart 261 is regulated by EPA in accordance with the requirements of SubtitleC of RCRA and its implementing regulations.F. Section 816.100_Contemporaneous ReclamationOSMRE proposes to revise existing andSection; 816.100 to remove a requirementwhich duplicates a requirement in proposed andSection; 816.101(b).Proposed new andSection; 816.101 would govern the scheduling of backfillingand grading. (See the immediately following heading, G. Section 816.101_Backfillingand Grading: Time and Distance Requirements.) Proposed andSection; 816.101(b)would authorize the regulatory authority to establish alternative backfillingand grading schedules. This same authorization currently appears as thelast sentence of andSection; 816.100, but is more appropriate in the contextof andSection; 816.101.Thus, upon promulgation of andSection;816.101 the final sentence of existingandSection;816.100, which states that ``[t]he regulatory authority may establishschedules that define contemporaneous reclamation,'' would become superfluousand be removed.G. Section 816.101_Backfilling and Grading: Time and Distance RequirementsAs discussed previously, in 1983 OSMRE deleted from its regulations andSection;816.101,which in paragraph (a) set out time and distance requirements for backfillingand grading. (See II. Background, under the heading, E. ContemporaneousReclamation/Backfilling and Grading; for a related proposal, also see theimmediately preceding heading, F. Section 816.100_Contemporaneous Reclamation.)The district court remanded the deletion of andSection;816.101, and the courtof appeals agreed. OSMRE now proposes to add a new andSection;816.101 inconformance with the district court and court of appeals decisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 816.101(a)</ITAG>Proposed andSection;816.101(a) would establish surface coal mining backfillingand grading time and distance schedules for contour and area mining, andauthorize the regulatory authority to establish schedules for other surfacemining methods. For contour mining, andSection;816.101(a)(1) would requirethe completion of backfilling and grading within 60 days or 1,500 linearfeet following coal removal. For area mining, andSection;816.101(a)(2) wouldrequire completion within 180 days following coal removal, and not morethan four spoil ridges behind the pit being worked, the spoil from theactive pit constituting the first ridge.Under andSection;816.101(a)(3) the schedules for surface mining methods otherthan contour or area mining would be as established by the regulatory authoritythrough the State program approval process. Any schedule established bythe regulatory authority under andSection;816.101(a)(3) would have to incorporateone of the two standards set out in andSection;816.101(c).The time and distance requirements of proposed andSection;816.101(a) arethe same as in the 1979 rule. The preamble to that rule (44 FR 15224 (March13, 1979)) stated that its backfilling and grading schedules were basedon an analysis of existing State regulations. During preparation of thisproposed rule, OSMRE again reviewed the backfilling and grading schedulesin approved State programs. All State programs have adopted either the1979, or more stringent, schedules. Based on almost ten years of experience,these schedules are fully adequate to meet the goals of the Act for contemporaneousreclamation.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 816.101(b)</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 816.101(b) would allow the regulatory authority to establish,through the State program approval process, alternative backfilling andgrading schedules in lieu of those set out in andSection; 816.101(a). Thisresponds to comments received during outreach briefings, in which the Statesrequested backfilling and grading guidelines, but also asked to retaindiscretion in determining alternative schedules. OSMRE is proposing thisprovision to give State regulatory authorities the flexibility to adoptbackfilling and grading schedules which meet State-specific conditions.The alternative schedules, which would have to be consistent with the schedulesset out in andSection; 816.101(a), could apply to geographic units, miningmethods, or other categories selected by the regulatory authority. As requiredby subsequently discussed andSection; 816.101(c), each alternative schedulewould be based on either (1) the maximum time interval between removalof the coal and the completion of backfilling and grading; or (2) the maximumextent of the operation between coal removal and the completion of backfillingand grading, as measured in linear feet, number of spoil ridges, or otherquantifiable criteria.Alternative backfilling and grading schedules would be established as Stateprogram regulations approved by the Secretary. During the approval processeach alternative schedule, with supporting justification, would be reviewedby OSMRE to determine whether it would meet the requirements for contemporaneousreclamation. The review would be based on the climate, terrain, miningmethods and other physical conditions in the area to which the schedulewould apply.Under andSection; 816.101(b), for example, a State may wish to demonstratethat the requirement for backfilling and grading to follow coal removalby not more than sixty days is unrealistic for contour mining operationsin that State. In that case the Secretary might approve a longer durationas consistent with andSection; 816.101(a).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 816.101(c)</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 816.101(c) would require the regulatory authority toincorporate in any backfilling and grading schedule it established eitherof the two alternative standards set out in the rule. These standards wouldapply both to schedules for other surface mining methods established underandSection; 816.101(a)(3), and to alternative schedules established underandSection; 816.101(b).The two alternative standards are (1) the maximum time interval betweencoal removal and the completion of backfilling and grading; and (2) themaximum extent of the operation between initial coal removal and the completionof backfilling and grading, as measured in lineal feet, number of spoilridges, or other quantifiable equivalent. These standards correspond withthe schedules set out in andSection;andSection; 816.101(a) (1) and (2), butlack specific numerical requirements, which would be added by the regulatoryauthority.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 816.101(d)</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 816.101(d) would authorize the regulatory authorityto extend the time allowed for backfilling and grading a specified portionof the permit area if the permittee demonstrated in accordance with 30CFR 780.18(b)(3) that additional time was necessary. The 1979 rules atandSection;andSection; 816.101(a) (1) and (3) for contour and area strip mining,respectively, made similar provision for granting additional time. 44 FR15411. As under the 1979 rule the regulatory authority could allow additionaltime for backfilling and grading if, for example, the permittee demonstratedthat the time limit of the rule was too restrictive because of weatheror local soil conditions. 44 FR 15226.H. Section 816.104_Backfilling and Grading: Thin Overburden, Section 816.105_Backfillingand Grading: Thick OverburdenAs discussed previously, in 1983 OSMRE replaced the numerical limits onthin and thick overburden in andSection;andSection; 816.104 and 816.105, respectively,with the more general statutory language. (See II. Background, under theheading, E. Contemporaneous Reclamation/Backfilling and Grading.) The districtcourt remanded these sections, and the court of appeals agreed, seekinga fuller statement of the reasons for the revision. OSMRE now proposesto revise andSection;andSection; 816.104 and 816.105, and to explain fullyits reasons for doing so, in conformance with the district court and courtof appeals decisions.For convenience, the proposed definitions of <T3>thin overburden </T3>and <T3>thick overburden </T3>in andSection;andSection; 816.104(a) and 816.105(a),respectively, are discussed together under the following combined subheading.The backfilling and grading performance standards for thin and thick overburdenin andSection;andSection; 816.104(b) and 816.105(b), respectively, are thendiscussed under separate subheadings.I. Section 816.104(a)_Definition of Thin Overburden, Section 816.105(a)_Definitionof Thick OverburdenOSMRE has reorganized andSection;andSection; 816.104 and 816.105 so that paragraphs(a) of these sections contain definitions of <T3>thin overburden </T3>and <T3>thick overburden, </T3>respectively, and paragraphs (b) contain thecorresponding backfilling and grading performance standards. The definitionswere not relocated to 30 CFR 701.5 because of their limited applicability.The term <T3>spoil, </T3>which is used in the definitions, is defined at andSection;701.5 to mean ``overburden that has been removed during surface coal miningoperations.''Proposed andSection; 816.104(a) defines <T3>thin overburden</T3> as ``insufficient spoil and other waste materialsavailable from the entire permit area to restore the disturbed area toits approximate original contour. Insufficient spoil and other waste materialsoccur where the overburden thickness times the swell factor, plus the thicknessof other available waste materials, is less than the combined thicknessof the overburden and coal bed prior to removing the coal, so that afterbackfilling and grading the surface configuration of the reclaimed areawould not: (1) [C]losely resemble the surface configuration of the landprior to mining; or (2) [b]lend into and complement the drainage patternof the surrounding terrain''.Proposed andSection; 816.105(a) defines <T3>thick overburden</T3> as ``more than sufficient spoil and other wastematerials available from the entire permit area to restore the disturbedarea to its approximate original contour. More than sufficient spoil andother waste materials occur where the overburden thickness times the swellfactor exceeds the combined thickness of the overburden and coal bed priorto removing the coal, so that after backfilling and grading the surfaceconfiguration of the reclaimed area would not: (1) [C]losely resemble thesurface configuration of the land prior to mining; or (2) [b]lend intoand complement the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain''.Each of these two definitions includes three standards which incorporatethe requirements of sections 515(b)(3) and 701(2) of the Act. The firststandard is the sufficiency of the overburden, and in the case of thinoverburden, other waste materials, to restore approximate original contour(AOC). The second and third standards, which are elements of the first,concern the definition of AOC in terms of the surface configuration anddrainage pattern off the reclaimed area. OSMRE proposes to adopt thesegeneral standards for the following reasons.The exemptions in section 515(b)(3) of the Act for areas of thin and thickoverburden are based on the sufficiency of the overburden to restore theland to AOC. Thin overburden is insufficient to restore AOC; thick overburdenin more than sufficient. Thus, whether thin or thick overburden occursdepends fundamentally on the definition of <T3>AOC.</T3>Section 701(2) of the Act and the corresponding regulation at 30 CFR 701.5generally define <T3>AOC</T3> as ``that <T3>surface configuration</T3> achieved by backfilling and grading of themined area so that <T3>the reclaimed area</T3> including any terracing or access roads, [1]<T3>closely resembles the general surface configuration of the land priorto mining</T3> and [2] <T3>blends into and complements the drainage pattern of the surroundingterrain</T3>, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated * * *. '' (Emphasisadded.)Under this definition the two principal standards for determining AOC arewhether the surface configuration of the reclaimed area would (1) closelyresemble the surface configuration of the land prior to mining; and (2)blend into and complement the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain.In restoring AOC, both of these standards must be met.The proposed definitions of <T3>thin overburden</T3> and <T3>thick overburden</T3> incorporate these two standards from the definitionof <T3>AOC</T3> as the measure of whether the spoil and other available wastematerials are sufficient to restore AOC. The definitions apply these twostandards for AOC in the disjunctive, using the term <T3>or</T3>, because a failure to meet either standard would prevent therestoration of AOC, and thus establish the occurrence of thin or thickoverburden.Unlike the proposed rule, the 1979 regulations defined thin and thick overburdenin precise numerical terms as having a final thickness of twenty percentless or more, respectively, than the initial thickness of the overburdenand coal. 44 FR 15412-13. As it did in 1983, OSMRE again rejects thoseprecise numerical terms as impractical for evaluating the utility of theoverburden and other available waste materials to restore AOC. As the Congresshas stated, ``[AOC] is, of necessity, a flexible standard which contemplatesdifferent mining circumstances''. H.R. Rep. No. 95-218, 95th Cong., 1stSess. 96 (1977).Defining thin and thick overburden in precise numerical terms is impracticalbecause of the diversity of surface configurations and drainage patternsto which the proposed rule would apply throughout the coal mining regionsof the United States. What might constitute a gross variation from AOCon flat prairie land might be barely perceptible in rugged mountain terrain.Depending on the circumstances, inflexible numerical standards might beeither too loose or too stringent, and seldom ideal. The use of the word<T3> approximate</T3> in the term AOC in itself supports the adoption ofa subjective standard. OSMRE is aware of no technical basis for universallyrelating a standard of twenty percent more or less overburden, or any othernumerical standard, to the restoration of AOC. The previously quoted definitionsof<T3> AOC</T3> at section 701(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 710.5 employ no suchnumerical standard. The existing backfilling and grading performance standardsat 30 CFR 818.102, which in paragraph (a) require backfilling and gradingto ``[a]chieve the approximate original contour,'' employ no such numericalstandard. Evaluations of post-mining surface configuration and drainage pattern involvesubjective professional judgments that must be custom-tailored to approximatethe terrain at any given mine. The responsible regulatory authority isbest equipped to determine the sufficiency of overburden to restore AOCin its own jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis using general standards.For these reasons OSMRE believes it is preferable to define<T3> thin overburden</T3> and<T3> thick overburden</T3> generally to conform with the standards of theAct, while giving the regulatory authority sufficient discretion to applythese standards in a sound professional manner to the diverse conditionswhich prevail at individual mines in each particular State.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 816.104(b)_Thin Overburden Performance Standards </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 816.104(b) sets out the performance standards that applywhere thin overburden, as defined in andSection; 816.104(a), occurs withinthe permit area. The permittee would establish the occurrence of thin overburdenin accordance with 30 CFR 780.18(b)(3), which governs the content of thepermit application reclamation plan as it relates to backfilling, soilstabilization, compacting and grading. Where the occurrence of thin overburden was established, andSection; 816.104(b)would require the permittee at a minimum to (1) use all spoil and otherwaste materials available from the entire permit area to attain the lowerpracticable grade, but not more than the angle of repose; and (2) meetthe general backfilling and grading requirements of 30 CFR 816.102 (a)(2)through (j). The performance standards in andSection;andSection; 816.104(b) (1) and (2)are the same as were adopted by OSMRE in 1983 (48 FR 23369), and are intendedto complement the general backfilling and grading performance standardsin andSection; 816.102. Section 816.104(b)(1) derives directly from the thinoverburden exemption in section 515(b)(3) of the Act. Section 816.104(b)(2)incorporates all of the requirements of andSection; 816.102, which sets outthe general requirements for backfilling and grading, except for thosein andSection; 816.102(a)(1), which requires the restoration of AOC, andthose in andSection; 816.102(k), which lists a number of exemptions, includingone for thin overburden. The only practicable difference between the general performance standardsin andSection; 816.102 and those for thin overburden in andSection; 816.104(b)is that for the latter the achievement of AOC is not required. Together,andSection;andSection; 816.104(b) (1) and (2) incorporate all of the requirementsfor backfilling, grading and compacting thin overburden that appear insection 515(b)(3) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 816.105(b)_Thick Overburden Performance Standards </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 816.105(b) sets out the performance standards that applywhere thick overburden, as defined in andSection; 816.105(a), occurs withinthe permit area. The permittee would establish the occurrence of thickoverburden in accordance with 30 CFR 780.18(b)(3), which governs the contentof the permit application reclamation plan as it relates to backfilling,soil stabilization, compacting and grading. Where the occurrence of thick overburden was established, andSection; 816.105(b)would require the permittee at a minimum to (1) restrore the approximateoriginal contour and then use the remaining spoil and other water materialsto attain the lowest practicable grade, but not more than the angle ofrepose; (2) meet the general backfilling and grading requirements of 30CFR 816.102 (a)(2) through (j); and (3) dispose of any excess spoil inaccordance with 30 CFR 816.71 through 816.74. The performance standards in andSection;andSection; 816.105(b) (1) through(3) are the same as were adopted by OSMRE in 1983 (48 FR 23369), and areintended to complement the general backfilling and grading performancestandards in andSection; 816.102. Section 816.105(b)(1) derives directlyfrom the thin overburden exemption in andSection; 515.(b)(3) of the Act.Section 816.105(b)(2) incorporates all of the requirements of andSection;816.102, which sets out the general requirements for backfilling and grading,except for those in andSection; 816.102(a)(1), which requires the restorationof AOC, and those in andSection; 816.102(k), which lists a number of exemptions,including one for thick overburden. Section 816.105(b)(3) references theexisting regulations governing the disposal of excess spoil, and wouldensure that any spoil and other waste materials that would exceed the angleof repose are disposed of in accordance with the requirements of the Act.The only practical differences between the general performance standardsin andSection;816.102 and those for thick overburden in andSection;816.105(b)are that under the latter (1) after AOC is restored the permittee may continueto use any remaining spoil and other waste materials to attain the lowestpracticable grade, but not more than the angle of repose; and (2) the permittedmust dispose of any excess spoil in accordance with andSection;andSection;816.71through 816.74. Together, these sections incorporate all of the requirementsfor backfilling, grading and compacting thick overburden that appear insection 515(b)(3) of the Act.I. Sections 816.133(d)/817.133(d)_AOC VariancesExisting andSection;andSection;816.133(d)/817.133(d) set out criteria for thegranting of a variance from the requirement to restore disturbed areasto their approximate original contour, including in paragraphs (d)(1) thatthe variance be granted in accordance with andSection; 785.16. This referenceto remanded andSection; 785.16 promoted the district court to remand andSection;andSection;816.133(d)/817.133(d) to the extent they permitted a variance other thanfor steep slope mining. (See related discussion in II. Background, underthe heading, B. AOC Variances, and in this section of the preamble underthe heading, B. Section 785.16_Permits Incorporating Variances from AOCRestoration Requirements for Steep Slope Mining.)As explained previously, OSMRE suspended andSection;andSection; 816.133(d)/817.133(d)in compliance with the district court decision. The proposed revision ofandSection; 785.16 would render these suspensions superfluous.
