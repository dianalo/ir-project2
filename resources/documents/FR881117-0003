During these supplemental structural inspectionsconducted in accordance with AD 87-14-07, an operator found skin cracksat 4 locations near longeron 1 at overwing stations on a Model DC-9-30series airplane that had accumulated a total of approximately 69,000 landings.On another airplane with 65,000 landings, cracked skin fasteners were noted,and upon further inspection, 14 longeron cracks were found. Subsequentinspections have revealed skin cracks on 4 airplanes and longeron crackson 23 airplanes. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the cracksare attributed to fatigue.This condition, if not corrected, could degrade the structural integrityof the fuselage and lead to possible rapid decompression.The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Alert ServiceBulletin A53-230, dated November 2, 1988, which describes the areas tobe inspected, methods of inspection, and repair instructions.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design, this AD requires repetitive external eddy currentinspections for cracks in the fuselage skin and longerons, and repair,if necessary, in accordance with the McDonnell Douglas service bulletinpreviously mentioned. Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. Based on the reports of cracking described above, the FAA has issued aseparate rulemaking action, Docket 88-NM-178-AD, which proposes to requirerepetitive aided visual inspections of the longerons in the area of theupper fuselage over the wing. However, the proposed initial compliancetime for those inspections is sufficient so as to afford the public anopportunity to comment on the proposed rule.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further detemined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:1. The authority citation for Part 39 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g)(Revised Pub.

Prior to the accumulation of 55,000 landings, or within the next30 days, whichever occurs later, unless accomplished within the last 1,000landings, perform external eddy current inspections of the fuselage skinand longerons from longeron 7 left through 7 right, in accordance withthe accomplishment instructions of McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Alert ServiceBulletin A53-230, dated November 2, 1988, within the range of fuselagestations for the particular series airplane as specified in Table I ofthat service bulletin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B.
