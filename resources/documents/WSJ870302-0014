StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP CANDA JAPAN FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. dollar is likely to move within a tight range this week, pressured on one side by the sluggish American economy and on the other by the prospect of central-bank intervention, traders said.    The currency has traded narrowly since an accord aimed at stabilizing exchange rates was announced Feb. 22 in Paris by the six major industrialized countries. In describing the agreement -- reached by finance ministers from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- some participants indicated that central banks planned coordinated intervention if the dollar fell sharply.    &quot;There's a paralysis of the market's will to trade. Very few traders are holding on to positions,&quot; said Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign exchange at First National Bank of Chicago. &quot;They don't want to sell because they're afraid of what the central banks may do, and they don't want to buy because of all the bearish economic news out there. That's what's inducing all this paralysis.&quot;    Expectations of intervention enabled the dollar to weather negative news about the U.S. economy last week. On Friday, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit widened to $14.78 billion in January, and it revised the December gap to $12.73 billion from the $10.66 billion first reported. The Labor Department said the same day that consumer prices climbed 0.7% in January. A 7.5% drop during January in new orders for durable goods had been reported last Thursday.    Such news ordinarily would have sparked much heavier sales of dollars than were seen, traders said. &quot;If you wanted to sell it, you had plenty of opportunities,&quot; said Samuel F. Lek, a trader at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York. But because of fear of intervention, he said, &quot;there doesn't seem to be any desire to sell the dollar.&quot;    Dealers expect trading to remain uneventful this week. &quot;People may begin to conclude that nothing will happen in this market until Friday, when we get the unemployment numbers,&quot; said First Chicago's Mr. Glass. U.S. employment statistics for February generally are expected to be very weak, perhaps weak enough to cause a dollar sell-off and test the central banks' resolve to support the currency. Among other things, the statistics are expected to show that the jobless rate rose to 6.8% from 6.7% in January.    The dollar generally rose Friday from Thursday. But compared with its levels of a week earlier, the currency was narrowly mixed.    In late New York dealings Friday, the U.S. unit stood at 1.8258 West German marks, up from 1.8225 Thursday. The dollar also firmed to 153.18 Japanese yen from 152.98. But the British pound climbed to $1.5480 from $1.5408.    The ramifications of the Iran-Contra affair, and the resignation of Donald T. Regan as White House chief of staff, had little impact on the dollar Friday, traders said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for March delivery fell $1.10 an ounce, to $405.40, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $404.55 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                        New York    Home Mkt.
