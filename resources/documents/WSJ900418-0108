Just the other day, forinstance, a report on global warming during the 1980s stated,&quot;The Northern Hemisphere goes up slightly during those 10years and the Southern Hemisphere goes down slightly. The neteffect for the globe is basically zero.&quot;   Other data suggest many of our pollution problems, thoughreal, are not worthy of panic. But are we urged by theexperts to quietly collect the facts and then respondaccordingly? Or are we urged to act as if the Death Star hadjust entered U.S. airspace? We know the answer. Quiet reasonis out. This is the age of the bogeyman.   Let us peruse his library.   &quot;The earth is getting warmer,&quot; writes Jon Naar in &quot;Designfor a Livable Planet&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 338 pages, $12.95).&quot;Glaciers are melting. Ocean levels are rising. The world'sclimates are changing.&quot; That's not all, &quot;The land is poisonedwith chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The seas arecesspools of trash and toxic waste. There is even the dangerthat atmospheric air pollution . . . has reached a point ofno return, that the impact of existing pollution willradically change our climate regardless of what preventativemeasures we take.&quot;   There is the additional danger that many of Mr. Naar'smore sensitive readers have just wet their pants. If moreprompting is needed, the author also quotes a &quot;radonspecialist&quot; at the Environmental Defense Fund (the executivedirector of which wrote the book's introduction): &quot;From allthe evidence, radon in the home is the most deadlyenvironmental hazard in America today.&quot;   A feature on radiation seeping quietly into places such asyour baby's crib is entitled &quot;Silent Holocaust,&quot; and severalpages later, this quote from author Robert O. Becker jumpsout of the bushes and shouts: &quot;We have evidence that man-madeelectronic fields from power lines are far more productive ofserious health effects than cigarette smoking.&quot;   As the government recently reminded us, 59 cigarettedeaths occur every 75 minutes. Are we really being zapped atan equal rate? And if VDTs really do cause cancer, shouldn'tJoyce Carol Oates be dead by now? (And if she doesn't writeon a computer, is this the time to take up a collection tobuy her one?)   Another area of concern is air pollution. Will Steger andJon Bowermaster have lots to say about it in &quot;Saving TheEarth&quot; (Knopf, 305 pages, $19.95). But wait a minute, fellas.According to your book, Denver (No. 2 in the &quot;dirty skies&quot;competition) has a horizon that is &quot;blocked by a dirty brownhaze every other day.&quot; Now I know Denver. I work in Denver. Iwear corrective lenses. And I can tell you that the horizonisn't blocked every other day -- far from it. Are you guystrying to scare us?   And what's all this drum-banging for alternative fuels?You guys know they clean up some types of emissions butincrease others, including formaldehyde -- A KNOWNCARCINOGEN] Nor is there reason to pant heavily for increasedtailpipe standards. In Denver, for instance, 80% of thepollution is caused by 20% of the cars. New cars aren't theproblem.   Besides, you're right about keeping our cars tuned up andabout the need for a change in some people's attitudes. Justthe other day, for instance, a local heavy-equipment operatorspoke these chilling words about her bulldozer: &quot;I reallylike that big puff of black smoke. There's such a sense ofcontrol about it.&quot;   Such statements are enough to send your average enviroaround the bend, where there's a good chance he or she willbump into Gary Null, parts of whose &quot;Clearer, Cleaner, Safer,Greener&quot; (Villard, 293 pages, $18.95) sound as if they werewritten three weeks after the Thorazine bottle went dry.Because he resembles a substantial portion of theenvironmental community, let us put our foot on his throatand declaim awhile.   Mr. Null, a radio and television personality, could becharacterized as a fundamentalist tree hugger. For instance,if you're against nuclear power, as he is, you are &quot;in therational camp,&quot; while the opposition is &quot;noticeably morehysterical and reactionary.&quot;   Now Mr. Null is entitled to his opinions, and we certainlywon't classify him with other anti-nuke activists such as theBerrigan boys, one of whom was arrested for banging on anuclear warhead with a hammer. But we all know nuclearprotesters; some of us have fired on them with water cannons.Committed, they are. Calm and rational? Come now.   In the same vein, Mr. Null attempts to shake us up aboutgenetically engineered solutions to the European corn-borerproblem. First he states that &quot;viruses and bacteria areextremely dangerous organisms with which to beexperimenting,&quot; and then adds that &quot;AIDS and many otherserious {]} illnesses are related to microbial infection.&quot;Talk about a smear job. And what's more, Mr. Null is surelyaware that AIDS is not spread by boring corn. Isn't he?   And while on the subject of food, Mr. Null has more badnews: &quot;American agriculture is teetering on the brink ofdisaster and getting more vulnerable every day.&quot; It producesfood that &quot;ceases to have any connection with nature, losingmuch of its ability to heal and sustain us.&quot;   This last statement will surprise those of us who havelived many prosperous years on Velveeta and Big Macs. Butthat statement is nothing compared with this howler:&quot;Notwithstanding the claims of our doctors and healthprofessionals that Americans are living longer than everbefore, you only have to look around to see that, as anation, we have never before been more unhealthy.&quot;   &quot;Claims&quot; that we are living longer? &quot;Death and Dying,&quot; anauthoritative source, puts the lie to Mr. Null and the restof the doom platoon. The fact is, this planet is more livablethan ever. Neanderthals (original versions) lived an averageof 29 years. Cro-Mags could expect to live 32; ancient Greeksand Romans, 36 years; 14th-century Englanders, 38; and20th-century Americans, 72 long ones.   Nonetheless, Mr. Null wants us to &quot;say `No' to ersatzfood,&quot; and promises, in return, a revival of the soul: &quot;Forthose of us who do care, food begins to take on an importanceequaling, if not surpassing, that placed on it by Europeans.&quot;Can it really be? Well, one thing's for sure. Mr. Null isgoing to be awfully upset when he dies, having spent so muchtime making sure his melons were manure-red and otherwiseshopping as if the right purchases could help him evade theAngel of Death.   But enough bad news. What is to be done to &quot;heal theplanet&quot;?   For one thing, bang anyone in the head who suggests thatnuclear power is an alternative for fossil fuels. So far, thefear campaign has worked, at least according to &quot;TheGreenpeace Book of the Nuclear Age&quot; (Pantheon, 378 pages,$14.95). &quot;Homo sapiens retains a natural skepticism towardsnuclear matters,&quot; we learn, and it is encouraging to notethat radiophobia is one of the fastest growing humanattitudes in the world in all societies.   That's a fairly questionable proposition, to be sure, butit did sound scientific the way they started the sentencewith a reference to Homo sapiens, didn't it? This selfsamecreature also should adopt a &quot;green lifestyle,&quot; and no greenHomo sapien would be without &quot;The Green Consumer&quot; (TildenPress/Penguin, 342 pages, $9.95) by John Elkington and JuliaHailes and Joel Makower.   This book isn't dripping with warm spit either, asexemplified by the section entitled &quot;How the American Way ofLife Is Destroying the Earth.&quot; We learn, among other things,that each person in New York City produces 3.96 pounds oftrash each day, while in Calcutta, each person produces only1.12 pounds. A role model, to be sure.   And isn't it time, ask the authors of &quot;Our Earth,Ourselves&quot; (Bantam, 340 pages, $10.95), that we learned from&quot;misadventures like South Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Lebanonthat we cannot be the policemen of the world&quot;? SinceNicaragua seems to have benefited from our policing, do theauthors take it back? Probably not, which brings up anotherproblem with many of these books. They are written as if topurposefully alienate the anti-Dukakis community. In light ofthis, we must applaud President Bush's decision not tointervene in the coagulation of Boston Harbor, despite hiscampaign rhetoric.   Is there no levity in the Bogeyman Library? Yes. MichaelW. Fox supplies a couple of chuckles in the &quot;The GreenLifestyle Handbook&quot; (Henry Holt, 196 pages, $10.95). &quot;Dogshave been sexually aroused by some hand creams,&quot; he reports,and &quot;Cats have gone berserk after their owners have put onexpensive perfume. One spry Siamese actually cornered hisowner in the bathroom for four hours.&quot;   Mr. Fox really outdoes himself by leading off one chapter,called &quot;Cruelty-Free Living,&quot; with a quotation from VictorHugo. Granted, Old Vic may have talked a good game aboutliving with nature. But according to biographer SamuelEdwards, every time he ate, the animal population droppedconsiderably.   Lunch, for example, often began with a pate, then fish,followed by the main course, which usually was a roast ofbeef, lamb, pork or veal. A respectful gorging in itself, butdinner was the big meal. First course, a dozen or twooysters, then sausages, often followed by lobsters (&quot;and heusually managed to down two of them,&quot; according to Mr.Edwards, &quot;chewing the shells as well as the lobster meat&quot;). Aroasted chicken also was a mainstay (&quot;Victor ate a youngchicken unaided&quot;) and then the main course, Beef Wellington,likely as not. Perhaps a new poster boy should be recruited.   In addition to loving the animals, Jeremy Rifkin, in theintroduction to &quot;The Green Lifestyle Handbook,&quot; suggests welearn to nuzzle the entire natural order. The &quot;new,post-modern view of science is based on empathy with theenvironment as opposed to subjugation over it,&quot; he says. Andonce we &quot;engage nature on an intimate level,&quot; Mr. Rifkinpromises, &quot;the relationship grows and deepens and becomesmore secure.&quot;   There are pantheistic elements to some of these books, aswhen Dr. Larry Dossey, also a handbook contributor, writesthat &quot;our minds extend beyond ourselves, and are interlockedin a give-and-take relationship not only with those of otherpersons but of the Earth itself.&quot; And as my estimablecolleague Vincent Carroll discovered, the radicalenvironmental group Earth First] publishes its journal eighttimes a year on the old pagan European nature holidays.   While we can poke fun at these books, all of them containhelpful information. My favorite is Marjorie Lamb's &quot;TwoMinutes a Day for a Greener Planet&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 243 pages,$7.95), which is three minutes a day longer than it takes toflatten your stomach.   And it is important to do something, if for no otherreason than practical mental health. That syndicated nationalden mom Ellen Goodman shone her light on this dark situationin a recent column:   &quot;It is an average day on the planet Earth. Acid rain isfalling on the city. The temperature is rising and you don'tknow whether it's spring or the greenhouse effect. You drivehome counting the fossil fuels you're devouring . . . Youstop at the supermarket for this week's groceries, which arenext century's landfill . . . This is your life in the era ofeco-worry. The most quantifiable result of the environmentalmovement is an anxious powerlessness growing across thelandscape like kudzu.&quot;   Here's one thing Ms. Goodman can do, as suggested innearly every book. Instead of using deodorant, substitute amixture of baking soda and cornstarch. Sure, by the time youget home from work you'll be carrying a couple of biscuits inyour armpits, but sacrifices must be made. And besides,biscuits are biodegradable.   ---   Mr. Shiflett is the deputy editorial page editor of theRocky Mountain News in Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
