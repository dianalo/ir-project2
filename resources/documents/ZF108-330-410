(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The color-retouching contendersandM;With the introduction of ColorStudio and Photoshop, PhotoMac now faces twoandM;serious competitors.andM;By Michael MurieandM;With the recent releases of ColorStudio from Letraset and Photoshop fromAdobe Systems Inc., Data Translation Inc.'s year-old PhotoMac has gainedstiff competition.andP;  All three products perform 24-bit color-retouching andpainting tasks as well as color separations, but they differ widely in theirorigins, interfaces and tool sets.andM;PhotoMac, the first entry (see MacWEEK, May 2, 1989), came out before Applereleased 32-bit QuickDraw, and therefore has a special adaptive color codethat selects the &quot;best&quot; colors to represent true color using an eight-bitdisplay.andP;  While all three programs can manipulate a 24-bit color image,Apple's 32-bit QuickDraw provides an extra eight-bit channel that can be usedfor non-image information.andP;  Both ColorStudio and Photoshop use these eightbits to provide a masking feature.andM;Data Translation also produces the ColorCapture video card for the Macintosh,and PhotoMac has a special menu supporting it.andP;  For this article we reviewedVersion 1.14 of PhotoMac, but we also looked at a prerelease copy of Version1.5, coming soon, that supports 32-bit QuickDraw and displays true coloron-screen (with a 24- or 32-bit video card).andM;ColorStudio, released in December (see MacWEEK, March 13), will look familiarto users of Letraset's gray-scale image-editing program, ImageStudio.andP;  Theprograms have much in common, including the Brush and Charcoal tools, butColorStudio is much more sophisticated and complex.andM;Photoshop, released in February (see MacWEEK, Nov.andP;  21, 1989), grew out of aprogram originally developed for users of the Barneyscan 35mm slide scanner,Barneyscan XP.andP;  Adobe purchased this program and added a multitude offeatures, including text and Encapsulated PostScript support.andM;The toolboxes.andP;  For image retouching, all three programs have good toolkits.andO;PhotoMac's tools are the most limited.andP;  ColorStudio's tools are the mostcomprehensive; seemingly every tool has extensive options and numericalcontrols.andP;  ColorStudio and Photoshop are, of these three, the programs ofchoice for true-color painting tasks.andM;Unlike the other programs, which use floating tool palettes, PhotoMac's toolsare represented as color icons on the left side of each open window.andP;  Weliked the simplicity of PhotoMac's auto-selection tool, which can be draggedthrough the colors to be selected.andP;  The auto-selection tool will thenhighlight the contiguous area around the selection with the same colors.andP;  Theprogram does not have a text tool.andM;PhotoMac provides a function called Invert from Negative, which is useful ifa color negative has been scanned using a slide scanner.andP;  The program's onlyfilter effects are Sharpen and Smooth, and they are not customizable.andP;  TheBlend Boundary function is useful for smoothing an image when it is added toan existing image.andP;  The amount of smoothing can be controlled by specifyingthe boundary width of the selection.andM;Unlike the other programs, PhotoMac does not allow you to work on one channelof an image (i.e.andP;  red or blue), and its brightness and contrast functionsare limited.andM;ColorStudio's painting, manipulation and selection tools can be altered tofunction in hundreds of ways; it takes a long time to scratch the surface ofthese tools' complexities.andP;  Each tool has two sets of parameters.andP;  ToolPreferences defines how a tool operates, including its interaction with theMask and Pressure functions.andP;  The second set of options, called PenPreferences, define the tool shape, size and transparency.andP;  User-defined penscan be added to the 39 that come with the program.andM;ColorStudio doesn't feature as many filter effects as Photoshop, but itsmasking function can perform effects similar to Photoshop's Paste Imagecontrol.andM;ColorStudio's auto-selection tool, like Photoshop's Magic Wand, can beparameterized to define the range of colors to be selected.andP;  Text inColorStudio is typed directly on the page, while Photoshop accepts text in anIllustrator-like dialog box and then places it on the page.andP;  Photoshop hasthe advantage here, since it offers controls for leading, spacing,anti-aliasing and a large range of point sizes.andM;Like ColorStudio, Photoshop has many options for each tool.andP;  Double-click atool icon and a dialog box appears featuring such parameters as opacity andfade-out rate (for brushes) or feathering (for selection tools).andP;  The linetool even features customizable arrow heads.andP;  Even so, there aren't as manyoptions as in ColorStudio, and there is only one custom brush shape.andM;Recognizing that it is sometimes difficult to operate tools precisely withthe regular cursor, Photoshop will substitute a cross-hair when the Caps Lockkey is held down.andP;  We also liked the Magic Eraser (obtained by holding downthe Option key while erasing), which restores the area of the image being&quot;erased&quot; with that part of the last saved version.andM;Photoshop can paste selections into or behind selected areas.andP;  When workingin the RGB (red, green, blue) color model, the program also offers a largerange of control to paste one image on top of another, similar to thesefunctions in Silicon Beach Software Inc.'s Digital Darkroom.andP;  Photoshop alsocomes with a large selection of filter effects.andM;Interface issues.andP;  PhotoMac is probably the most intuitive program of thethree.andP;  Its functions are easy to find and use.andP;  PhotoMac also has the leastnumber of functions, which contributes to its ease of use.andM;While both ColorStudio and Photoshop use dithering when running in eight-bitmode, PhotoMac uses special code to create an adaptive eight-bit display.andO;PhotoMac selects the best 256 colors to represent the image.andP;  We felt that itconsistently gave better results in eight-bit mode than the other programs.andO;If you are creating images for display with eight-bit video cards, usingPhotoMac and then capturing the screen will provide excellent results.andM;Having said how much we like the color mapping in PhotoMac, we must add thatVersion 1.14 will run only in eight-bit mode.andP;  Also, the beta version of 1.5,although it worked in 24-bit color, has an annoying habit of completelyblanking the screen when redrawing after rotating part of the image oradjusting the tone or color.andP;  We hope that this will be corrected in thefinal version.andM;ColorStudio features a very sophisticated interface; it is more detailed andcustomizable with various parameters than either PhotoMac or Photoshop.andP;  Thispower considerably affects the perceived ease of use of the program.andP;  Thescreen can fill with tool palettes, which make it awkward to operate on asmall screen.andP;  Functions that we felt should have been intuitive became clearonly after reading the manual.andP;  Rotating a selection and creating gradientfills are two examples.andM;There is also a lot to be said in praise of ColorStudio's interface.andP;  Atfirst we suspected that the reason it brought up a special tool window anddemanded that we click on Begin before it allowed us to rotate a selectionwas to hide the fact that the program wasn't fast enough to keep pace withus.andP;  But once it was ready, it very quickly rotated the selection (14 secondsvs.andP;  one minute 108 seconds for Photoshop), which made it much easier to findthe right angle when performing a rotation by eye.andP;  ColorStudio's maskfunction is powerful and intuitive, although we wish the Mask tool palettewas smaller.andM;We also liked ColorStudio's capability to save correction information aboutvariables such as contrast and brightness into a file that can be used toadjust other images in exactly the same manner.andP;  ColorStudio also has aPantone color palette, which the other programs lack.andM;Both ColorStudio and Photoshop can open a second window on an open image soyou can view it at two magnifications.andP;  If you have the necessary screenspace, this is an especially useful feature.andM;Photoshop's interface is very easy to grasp; tool selection and the operationof most functions will be obvious to an experienced Macintosh user.andP;  We likedthe simple Contrast and Brightness sliders (also in PhotoMac).andP;  Perhaps themost difficult function to master is the operation of the alpha channels asmasks.andP;  Unlike ColorStudio, which provides one mask layer, Photoshop has upto 13 masks or &quot;alpha channels&quot; that can be saved with the document.andP;  Bewarned that each mask adds considerably to the image size.andM;Photoshop's color picker has a simple method of selecting a desired color.andO;Each color can be specified in one of three color models -- RGB, HSB (hue,saturation, brightness) or CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) -- independently ofthe model being used to represent the total image.andP;  However, if you arecreating an image for CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) output, certaincolors that can be represented in the RGB and HSB models will not printcorrectly.andP;  If you select such a color, a warning triangle appears in thecolor picker.andP;  You can either continue and use the color, or Photoshop willselect the printable color closest to it.andM;The Cropping tool in Photoshop is especially effective for discardingunwanted portions of an image.andP;  Both PhotoMac and Color-Studio perform thesame function by saving a selected area, but the Cropping tool is moredirect.andM;We also liked Photoshop's Rubber Stamp tool, which can clone part of an imageto any other part of an image.andM;File support.andP;  PhotoMac can save files in eight- or 24-bit PICT and in 24-bitTIFF formats.andP;  Unfortunately, PhotoMac actually takes longer to open itsnative PICT file format than it takes to open the same file in TIFF format.andO;We were surprised that we were unable to read a TIFF file created byAppleScan that was read successfully by the other programs.andM;ColorStudio supports TIFF, PICT, MacPaint and its proprietary format, RIFF.andO;ColorStudio defaults to the compressed RIFF format, which offers quite a disksavings, but at the expense of time taken to open and save the file.andP;  If youhave the disk space, use the uncompressed format while working on images.andO;Surprisingly, uncompressed RIFF files are actually larger than TIFF files.andO;ColorStudio also comes with an add-on for converting Crosfield format files,and other formats may be supported soon.andM;Photoshop supports a large number of file formats.andP;  Additionally, the RAWformat has a &quot;guess&quot; feature: Supply the height and width of an image, or thefile header size, and Photoshop will attempt to guess the format of the file.andM;When exporting files to other formats, Photoshop provides the same largenumber of formats as well as controls such as resolution of output file andcreator type.andP;  Photoshop also can support other file types through plug-inmodules.andM;Creating separations.andP;  Most users of 24-bit color-retouching programs willwant to create color separations of their work for the printed page.andP;  Theseusers need to be aware of the relationship between the color model used tostore the image (usually RGB), the color model used to manipulate the imagein the computer (either RGB, HSB or CMY), and the CMYK model used to outputthe final work.andM;Both ColorStudio and Photoshop manuals have sections describing these colormodels, which should be read carefully.andM;Photoshop and ColorStudio support the RGB, HSB and CMY models, and theyoutput CMYK separations.andP;  PhotoMac supports the RGB and HSB models, andVersion 1.5 will support CMY (both versions output CMYK separations).andM;PhotoMac separations are defined through a Separation Setup dialog box.andP;  Herethe screen size, angles, paper types, gray-component-enhancement andgray-balance parameters are entered.andP;  PhotoMac can output CMYK PostScriptfiles, and an additional placement EPS file that allows QuarkXPress to addreferences to the PhotoMac separation files in its output.andM;PhotoMac also provides a means for creating separations with Aldus PageMakerand Letraset's Ready,Set,Go!.andP;  This involves creating a placement-only PICTfile, which is imported into the page-layout program, and then using aChooser driver called PageSaver to create an output file.andP;  This file is thenseparated by PhotoMac.andM;ColorStudio and Photoshop offer separation controls similar to PhotoMac's.andO;ColorStudio provides a set of printer parameter files used to map the RGBcolor space to the CMYK color space for particular printers.andP;  If calibrationdata for the printer you plan to use is provided (ColorStudio comes with datafor most major printers), color accuracy is improved, and separation is mucheasier.andM;Photoshop instead comes with an extensive tutorial on how to calibrate yoursystem to your printer.andP;  The tutorial describes calibrating the monitor toactual printed results.andP;  ColorStudio provides a calibration image printed inthe manual and asks the user to calibrate the monitor to it before startingwork.andP;  PhotoMac does no calibration at all.andM;Images consistently appeared lighter on-screen in ColorStudio than inPhotoMac and Photoshop with default settings.andP;  We felt that ColorStudio gavethe best screen representation, probably because of its internal screencalibration.andM;Performance.andP;  None of the programs were noticeably nimble in the tests weperformed, probably because of the huge file sizes and memory requirements oftrue-color work.andP;  While a 5-Mbyte file may seem large, remember that in manyprinting processes that file can be printed at a maximum size of 4 by 5inches before lack of resolution becomes noticeable.andP;  Full-page images takeup about 20 Mbytes.andM;We found we were consistently waiting for things to finish.andP;  If you areserious about using this software, consider buying a Mac IIfx and the biggestand fastest hard disk you can find.andM;Modularity.andP;  Both ColorStudio and Photoshop represent the latest in plug-intechnology.andP;  Features can be added and removed either by using a ResourceMover (in the case of Color-Studio) or by dragging the resources into theapplication folder (Photoshop).andM;Plug-in technology is used by scanner manufacturers and other third-partyvendors to add functionality to the base program.andP;  You should research whatdevice support is available for your equipment before you make a buyingdecision.andM;Documentation.andP;  All three programs come with manuals that feature examplesand color illustrations.andP;  ColorStudio also comes with video and audio tapes.andO;Photoshop includes a separate tutorial booklet and advertising literature forthird-party products.andP;  We don't usually get excited about documentation, butwe would rank Photoshop's manual among the best we've seen for its clearexplanations and examples.andP;  ColorStudio's manual writers were handicapped byhaving to document a more complicated program in fewer pages, but onlyColorStudio offers on-line help.andM;Conclusions.andP;  ColorStudio and Photoshop represent new capabilities as well asa new market for the Mac.andP;  As such, they are some of the best programmingexamples around.andM;PhotoMac, having had the market almost to itself, now faces two seriouscompetitors that could not only legitimize the market but also steal some ofits market share.andP;  Data Translation now must decide whether to join thefeatures war or to concentrate on specific markets.andP;  For eight-bit screenrepresentations, the current version of PhotoMac bests its newer rivals.andM;Both ColorStudio and Photoshop have a myriad of features and functions formanipulating color images and for creating color pictures from scratch.andO;Which is best?andP;  Both are impressive programs, and the buying decision mayrest solely on an individual feature that you prefer, or perhaps on price.andO;At twice the price, ColorStudio is more sophisticated than Photoshop, but noteveryone needs its capabilities.andM;However, color separation is still a mysterious art requiring uncommon skilland knowledge.andP;  Whether the &quot;rest of us&quot; could purchase one of theseprograms, scan in a picture, press a button to create a separation, take thefile to the printer and come back with a wonderful color image the first timeremains to be seen.andM;We reviewed three color-retouching programs here: Data Translation'sPhotoMac, Letraset's ColorStudio and Adobe Systems' Photoshop.andP;  Thesepackages are all capable of working on 24-bit images and creating colorseparations.andM;Performance tests revealed that the genre stretches the capabilities of anyMacintosh system.andP;  Large amounts of memory, disk space and processinghorsepower are required if you plan to use them for extended periods.andM;In paintbrush effects, ColorStudio is the clear winner with its manyparameters and editable shapes.andP;  Photoshop has fewer and only onecustomizable brush shape, while PhotoMac has only one effect (opacity) and noeditable brush shapes.andM;In file support, Photoshop comes out ahead because of its many formats andits RAW option.andP;  ColorStudio and Photo-Mac support almost identical formats,although ColorStudio was able to read a TIFF file PhotoMac could not, andColorStudio may be able to support other formats through annexes (add-onmodules).andM;For adaptability, the plug-in and annex modules of Photoshop and ColorStudiopromise new features and device support without the need for updates to theprogram.andM;ColorStudio comes out of the box with annexes for four scanners; Photoshophas none as yet.andP;  PhotoMac only supports Data Translations' ColorCapture andhas no provision for other devices.andM;We liked Photoshop's interface and documentation best.andP;  We foundColorStudio's interface to be more complicated, but this may reflect itsextra features.andP;  PhotoMac's interface is easy to use, but its documentationlacks mention of color theory or calibration, both of which are well-coveredin the other two packages.andM;While we usually support the theory that you get what you pay for, we don'tbelieve that ColorStudio's extra features justify paying double the price ofPhotoshop.andP;  For retouching, it would be difficult to choose between the two.andO;For color painting, we might go with ColorStudio, but only if we were sure wewere going to exhaust Photoshop's features.andP;  While we liked some ofPhotoMac's features, its price is so close to Photoshop's that we would gowith Photoshop unless we were using a ColorCapture board or an eight-bitdisplay.andP;  That assessment may change with the release of PhotoMac 1.5,however.andM;While users have been working with Data Translation's PhotoMac for more thana year, Letraset's ColorStudio and Adobe Systems' Photoshop have only beenout for a short time.andP;  However, many professional users and service bureaushave been working with prerelease versions of Photoshop and ColorStudio formonths.andP;  Now that these programs have shipped, here are some userimpressions:andM;Gary Schulthess, production manager at CalSierra Ltd. of Martinez, Calif., adesktop pre-press house, uses Photoshop for almost all file manipulation thatwould normally be done on a stripping table.andP;  CalSierra has been usingPhotoshop for more than a year; the company started withBarneyscan XP.andO;Schulthess particularly likes the documentation and describes it as &quot;a hellof a package.&quot;andM;Alan Brown of Photonics Graphics of Cincinnati is a photographer who has usedall three products.andP;  PhotoMac's ease of use, color palette and transparencypainting were the features Brown liked best in that package.andM;Brown praised ColorStudio's interface to his Howtek scanner, as well as itsmasking functions and many options.andP;  He was less enthusiastic about itsinterface capabilities.andM;He said he prefers Photoshop's intuitive feel and said it works better inlow-memory situations than does ColorStudio, which often won't perform Undoin such cases.andP;  He said he is pleased with Photoshop's Scitex interface butfound the Airbrush tool disappointing.andM;Serban Epure, a designer and computer illustrator for Frankfurt Gibbs Balkindof New York, has been using ColorStudio and Photoshop for photographicretouching and manipulation.andP;  He uses slides to put out finished images.andM;Epure describes ColorStudio as being more sophisticated in tool customizationand image masking, and Photoshop as much faster in operation.andP;  But &quot;thedifferences aren't so big&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;They are both good programs.&quot;andM;Color professionals are positive if a little cautious about the Macintosh'scapability to create color separations.andM;Mike Flake, while at CARE Medical Equipment in Portland, Ore., used PhotoMacto create 40 color separations for a catalog.andP;  Most of the images required nomanipulation, but an image with its sky retouched from gray to blue had, hesaid, probably the best quality of all the separations.andP;  Flake said he wasvery happy with the software but disappointed in the performance of his slidescanner.andM;Eric Shropshire, art director at Playboy magazine in Chicago, echoed Flake'scomments.andP;  &quot;We're waiting for the drum scanners (for the Mac).andP;  Our biggestproblem is the many different formats (for images) we have to deal with.&quot;andO;Shropshire has been using Photoshop, but he is using the resultant images forposition only, and scanning in the artwork again on high-end pre-pressequipment.andM;Playboy is experimenting in-house with the technology and has a MacintoshIIfx on order.andP;  While the company has more experience with Photoshop, it isalso evaluating ColorStudio, which it thinks might be slightly better forretouching purposes.andP;  -- By Michael MurieandM;Adobe Systems Inc.andM;Photoshop: $895andM;1585 Charleston Road, Box 7900, Mountain View, Calif.andP;
