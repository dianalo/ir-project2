(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's No. 1 video chain isswallowing No. 3 in a $40 million deal that gives BlockbusterEntertainment Corp. a total of more than 1,700 stores.   Blockbuster agreed to acquire Erol's Inc. of Springfield, Va., achain of 208 outlets that pioneered the video rental business in1980 but has struggled amid management shuffles and stiffcompetition.   The deal ``provides an outstanding opportunity for Blockbusterand its franchise owners to broaden the base of ourstores,''Blockbuster chairman and chief executive officer H. Wayne Huizengasaid Monday.   Erol's, the nation's third-largest chain behind WestCoast-National of Philadelphia, has stores in Philadelphia,Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago as well as 112 stores in theWashington, D.C., area, where Blockbuster has only 48 outlets andwas looking to expand.   Blockbuster, based in Fort Lauderdale, opened its 1,500th storeMonday, in Vancouver, British Columbia. In all, the chain hasstores in 44 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico,Canada and England.   Erol's founder and principal stockholder, Erol Onaran, said thebuyout was in the best interest of his 2,600 employees.   ``It was going to be a fight,'' said analyst Drew Beja at AdvestSecurities. ``And Blockbuster had the resources to win the fight.''   Onaron founded Erol's as a stereo repair shop in Washington in1963. It was an early pioneer in the video industry, opening storesexclusively devoted to rentals in 1980, and led all other videochains in revenue until Blockbuster surpassed it in 1988.   But Erol's has been stagnating since then, and didn't begin tosell franchises until last August, said Frank Molstad, editor ofVideo Store magazine.   In contrast, Blockbuster has been expanding by 400 to 500 storesa year since Huizenga bought the company in 1987 for $19 million,and Huizenga has said sales this year could top $1 billion.   Erol's had revenue of $100 million last year, said JerryFalkner, an analyst at Southwest Research Partners in Boca Raton.   While more than 1,700 stores by the end of the year, Blockbusterwill still have only about 10 percent of the home video market,said Fran Blechman Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.</TEXT></DOC>
