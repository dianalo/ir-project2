RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to revivelawsuits charging the government and federal contractors withnegligently causing deaths and disease among people exposed toopen-air atomic tests.   The court, without comment, let stand a federal law thateffectively spared the government from having to defend itselfagainst claims seeking billions of dollars.   The atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the case tookplace between the closing days of World War II and the adoption ofa treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1963banning open-air testing.   Suits were filed on behalf of 29 people _ civilians and membersof the military _ including 26 who died from cancer orcancer-related causes. The suits alleged that the health problemswere caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions.   Charged with negligence were the University of California, whichoperated the Los Alamos, N.M., project; Lawrence Livermorelaboratories, which helped develop the atomic bomb; Sandia Corp.,which provided engineering for the weapons program; and ReynoldsElectric Engineering Co., which helped build and operate a testsite in Nevada.   The suits accused the private contractors of failing to takeadequate safety precautions at the test sites, and also said thegovernment was responsible for failing to enforce its own safetystandards.   If the suits were successful, the government ultimately wouldpay the claims because it had insured the private contractors forany losses.   But in 1984 Congress passed a law supported by the Reaganadministration that says only the U.S. government may be sued fornegligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomicweapons testing program.   The result was to bar the claims since the government is immunefrom such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existingFederal Tort Claims Act.   Those who sued the companies said the 1984 lawunconstitutionally deprived them of a remedy for the deaths anddisease caused by the atomic explosions.   ``The petitioners had a remedy against the original defendants.They have none against the United States,'' they said.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law last June.It rejected arguments that the law violates the Constitution'srequired separation of powers by retroactively preventing thecourts from considering pending claims.   The administration, in urging the Supreme Court not to disturbthe appeals court decision, said more than 3,000 people are seekingdamages totalling more than $4.9 billion in all cases stemming fromthe weapons tests.   The high court on Jan. 11 refused to hear a related appeal bysome 1,200 people in Nevada, Arizona and Utah who sought to holdthe government financially responsible for deaths and diseasesallegedly caused by the tests in Nevada.   The case acted on today is Konizeski vs. Livermore Labs, 87-953.</TEXT></DOC>
