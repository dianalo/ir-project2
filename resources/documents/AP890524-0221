(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vermont on Wednesday became the firststate to ban vehicles that use ozone-depleting chemicals in theirair conditioning.   ``Americans are ready to take tough actions to protect ourfragile environment, even if it requires changing our own behavioror giving up certain luxuries,'' Gov. Madeleine Kunin said insigning the legislation into law.   ``By enacting this important legislation, Vermonters aredemonstrating that we are willing to act immediately to protect thestratospheric ozone layer,'' she said.   The ban covers the sale or registration of 1993 models that usechlorofluorocarbons, a class of chemical blamed for destroying theozone layer that protects the Earth from the sun's harmfulultraviolet rays.   Car air conditioning systems are the single largest source ofozone depletion from the United States.   The legislation takes other, more immediate steps to reduce CFCemissions:   _ Starting in 1991, equipment used to service air conditionersin vehicles must recycle the CFC coolant, rather than release itinto the atmosphere.   _ As of March 1, 1990, CFC recycling equipment must be used toservice building air conditioners and large refrigeration units ifsuch equipment is ``portable and suitable for those purposes.''   _ The sale of CFC recharge kits will be prohibited so thatconsumers cannot circumvent the law's recycling requirements byservicing their own cars' air conditioning systems.   _ The sale of CFC-based fire extinguishers, consumer cleaningsprays and CFC-propelled party streamers and horns is alsoprohibited.   Despite years of research into a replacement coolant, thenation's Big Three automakers have said they doubt they can meetthe 1993 deadline.   ``There is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify itsentire car line for Vermont in essentially three years,'' FordMotor Co. spokeswoman Beryl Goldsweig said earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
