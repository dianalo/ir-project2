The maker of printed circuits said a revision of its loan agreements with First National Bank of St. Paul require it to make a $5 million payment in February. An Advance Circuits official said the company is seeking financing for the payment, but so far has been unable to locate a new lender.    Advance Circuits said it revised its loan agreements after it defaulted on provisions that required to maintain a certain net worth. Hurt by the recession in the electronics industry, the company had a net loss of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 30 and $3.5 million loss for fiscal 1986.    An Advance Circuits official said the payment would reduce an existing $10 million term loan from First National. The company also has a $2 million revolving credit line with the bank.    The official said the company is working on a number of prospects for obtaining the $5 million. &quot;We don't have that kind of cash lying around,&quot; he said. If the company doesn't obtain the financing, &quot;we will be back negotiating with&quot; First National, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
