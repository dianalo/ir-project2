DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, the junk bond wizard who helpedmake Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. a Wall Street powerhouse, pleadedinnocent Friday to a wide-ranging federal indictment that chargedhim with turning the firm into a racketeering enterprise.   Milken entered his plea in a courtroom packed with more than 200reporters, lawyers and friends. Outside, dozens of supporters, somewearing hats that read ``Mike Milken We Believe in You,'' applaudedand cheered him as he left the courthouse without comment.   Also pleading innocent before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood atfederal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell, 40. Athird defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg, was absentdue to a skiing accident. He will be arraigned at a later date.   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud andracketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.   Michael Milken, tanned and smiling, entered the courtroom from arear door flanked by his lawyers Arthur Liman and MartinFlumenbaum. His wife, Lori, sat in the second row of the crowdedspectator section.   The standing room only crowd laughed when Ms. Wood asked him howhe felt and Michael Milken replied, ``OK, your honor.''   Lowell Milken, dressed in a gray suit said, ``I plead notguilty'' in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge.   Both Milkens were released without having to post bail afterAssistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defenselawyers had ``made substantial progress'' during talks to reach anacceptable bond for the defendants and their assets.   The charges seek $1.8 billion in forfeitures from each of thethree defendants, or their total combined earnings from 1984 to1987. The government reportedly had asked the three defendants eachto post a $1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on theirassets.   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationsact, assets found to be the result of racketeering activities aresubject to forfeiture and prosecutors could ask the judge to freezethe Milkens' assets to guarantee their availability in the event ofconviction.   If convicted, each of the three also faces maximum fines of $3.7billion if convicted on either or both of the racketeering counts.   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal   racketeering law _ double the gains made from the allegedlyillegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning tofinalize bond arrangements. The judge also scheduled Newberg'sarraignment April 25.   Following his indictment, Milken, 42, took a leave of absencefrom his job as head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-basedhigh-yield junk bond division, where he reportedly made more than$1 billion between 1983 and 1987.   Milken widely is considered a pioneer in making the low-gradesecurities a key source of financing for a wide range of corporatedeals. He is also credited with helping to transform Drexel into amajor investment banking house.   The racketeering indictment followed an investigation of WallStreet's fifth-largest investment firm that lasted more than twoyears. The probe was prompted by information supplied by convictedstock speculator Ivan Boesky.</TEXT></DOC>
