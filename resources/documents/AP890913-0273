The UnitedStates needs to make fundamental changes in its economic affairs orrisk losing out to international competitors, he warned.   Brady indicated the administration is considering ways to expandtax incentives to encourage individual savings, proposals toeliminate the double-taxation of stock dividends and initiativesthat would encourage corporate managers to focus more on long-termperformance.   ``Our approach to the challenges of the 1990s and beyond shouldbe to maintain our competitiveness where it's strong and to rebuildit where it has faltered,'' Brady said in a speech billed as theopening salvo in the administration's new campaign.   Brady said other nations are challenging America's economicleadership because the country has grown complacent with too manycorporate executives chasing quick profits rather than investing forlong-term performance.   ``It worries me when I see many of the best minds in Americaconcentrating on financial engineering rather than laying plans forsound corporate strategies for the future,'' Brady told members ofthe American Business Conference, who were invited to dinner at theTreasury Department.   Brady's comments received a generally warm response from theexecutives.   American Stock Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. told Bradythat many of his suggestions were similar to proposals by theBusiness Conference, which earlier this year called for a majorgovernment effort to boost the nation's savings rate to lower thecost of capital for U.S. businesses.   Brady, however, conceded that the administration hasn't found ananswer to the key problem raised by the proposals _ how should theybe funded.   Suggestions to expand tax-deferred savings plans such asIndividual Retirement Accounts could cost $15 billion over fiveyears, while any proposal to eliminate the double taxation ofcorporate dividends might cost as much as $40 billion annually.   The 1986 tax law sharply curbed IRA tax benefits for couplesmaking more than $40,000 a year or individuals earning more than$25,000 and covered by a company retirement plan.   Brady said the administration is currently wrestling with thecost question. He said final decisions probably will not come untilPresident Bush presents his next budget to Congress in January.   ``What we have done is commit ourselves to the kind of programthat I have outlined,'' he said. ``We are going to make it work.''   Part of the administration's competitiveness program includes thepresident's push to lower the capital gains tax rate.   On Tuesday, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and the chairman of theSenate Finance Committee, proposed offering deductible IRAs to alltaxpayers as a substitute for reducing the tax on capital gains.   Brady said expanding IRAs is being reviewed by theadministration, but he said the president remains committed togetting a cut in the capital gains rate.   Brady said the administration's proposals were aimed at loweringthe cost of businesses to raise needed capital to make long-terminvestment.   ``If we provided for more of our domestic investment needs withour savings, we'd have to import less capital from abroad, thusimproving our trade balance,'' Brady said.   Brady said the administration will be looking at a number ofoptions ``that give people the incentive to save, instead of toconsume.''</TEXT></DOC>
