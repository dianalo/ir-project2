The president of the United Rubber Workers was trying to save the job of Robert E. Mercer, chairman and chief executive officer of Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.    Mr. Stone introduced Mr. Mercer to a packed hotel room of applauding rubber workers as part of his effort to rally 25,000 URW members at 36 Goodyear plants to help the company fend off a hostile takeover bid by financier Sir James Goldsmith.    With such union support, Goodyear, the world's largest tire maker, thwarted the takeover -- but the victory proved costly to many of Mr. Stone's members. As part of its takeover defense, Goodyear launched a restructuring that will cost about 2,000 URW members their jobs.    Mr. Stone, who is struggling to shore up the URW's dwindling membership, contends that many more jobs would have been lost had Goodyear been taken over. But his tactics for saving jobs have angered some members, who say he has been too eager to offer concessions to keep plants open. His prospects for reelection in October could be dimmed as a result.    Unionized rubber workers, like unionized auto workers, are an elite group. Many work under master labor contracts that call for wages and benefits totaling about $22 an hour, a little less than the roughly $24 an hour for the United Auto Workers.    Says the 59-year-old Mr. Stone, who displays in his office a photograph of himself as a young rubber mixer: &quot;I live a lot better than my father,&quot; who was a dairy farmer. &quot;He worked like a slave all his life and didn't have anything.&quot;    But the URW has shrunk dramatically. The union claims 108,000 members, down 45% since 1974. Yet some say its true membership may be as low as 85,000 because laid-off workers with little chance of being recalled are still counted.    Like other old-line industrial unions, such as the UAW and the United Steelworkers, the URW has been battered by plant closings, corporate restructurings and foreign imports. In addition, technological advances permit tire makers to operate with far fewer workers. And most new tire plants built in the past decade or so are nonunion.    Some tire executives, such as John J. Nevin, chief executive officer of Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co., say Mr. Stone understands the industry's problems. But Mr. Stone's union critics aren't so generous. They say he has been lax about organizing new members, for example.    His most prominent critic is his predecessor, Peter Bommarito, who says &quot;the URW should be out organizing anyone with rubber heels on their shoes or rubber erasers on their pencils.&quot;    Mr. Bommarito handpicked Mr. Stone as his successor in 1981. &quot;I have to admit that it's my biggest mistake,&quot; Mr. Bommarito now says. Mr. Stone wouldn't discuss Mr. Bommarito.    Mr. Bommarito doesn't rule out running for his old office, even though language in the URW constitution virtually blocks him from seeking the job he held for 15 years. Or he might support a candidate to oppose Mr. Stone.    But some labor experts wonder whether anyone can provide union members much hope. &quot;The future looks terrible for the rubber workers,&quot; asserts Leo Troy, a Rutgers University labor professor. He believes the URW will survive into the next century only as an affiliate of a much larger union like the Steelworkers, which has about 650,000 members.    If the URW were to combine, one likely mate is the UAW because both unions have many members making automotive products. When he was URW chief, Mr. Bommarito began discussing an affiliation with the UAW. But Mr. Stone broke off the courtship, fearing his union would lose its independence to the UAW, which has nearly 10 times as many members.    Instead, Mr. Stone favors merging with smaller unions in industries similar to rubber and plastic. A leading candidate is the International Chemical Workers, with about 65,000 members. But Prof. Troy thinks such a merger &quot;would buy the URW only a couple of years.&quot;    Some members object to tactics that they think indicate Mr. Stone is giving up without a fight. In an unusual move, URW Local 670, which serves a former Armstrong Tire andamp; Rubber Co. plant, sued the union in federal court in Nashville, Tenn., last year, claiming headquarters made concessions to Armstrong without the local's approval. &quot;There very clearly was a conspiracy between the union and the company,&quot; charges Local 670 President Donald P. Copass.    Mr. Stone says his job is to try to keep plants open. &quot;It's better to stay in (with concessions) because once a plant goes down, it's rare that it starts up again.&quot; He contends the URW has lost less ground through concessions than some other unions, most notably the Steelworkers.    Mr. Stone recently approved work-rule changes to persuade Bridgestone Corp., the big Japanese tire maker, to make radial light-truck and passenger tires at its URW-represented plant outside Nashville. The plant makes large truck tires. Bridgestone, he says, &quot;never asked for any relief on wages and benefits.&quot;    Mr. Stone believes industrial unions will rebound. Still, he says his union job, with a base salary of $70,196, &quot;isn't any fun any more. It's tough not to preach gloom and doom.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
