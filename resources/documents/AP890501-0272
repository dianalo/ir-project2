Sanford J. Grossman of Princeton University will conduct thedual trading study in connection with the Board of Trade's ownreview of trading practices.   Dual trading, which refers to a trader buying or selling futurescontracts for himself and for customers, has come under attack as aconflict of interest.   The announcement comes three months after disclosures of afederal investigation into suspected fraud at the Board of Tradeand the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   ``The Chicago Board of Trade has dedicated itself to evaluatingall aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' saidKarsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann, chairman of the exchange.``Commissioning this study is another step in this process.''   One complaint is that dual trading creates a situation thatallows a trader to first trade his own account in a way that wouldprofit from price swings resulting from filing the customer'sorder. That action would violate law.   Grossman's study of dual trading will be conducted in two parts,officials said, with the first _ explaining how the practice works_ completed by July. The second study, based on observing tradersin the pits making dual trades, is due in 1990.   Grossman was a contributor to a report on the 1987 stock marketcrash commissioned by the New York Stock Exchange.   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade ``has received many letters andother expressions of concern from commercial customers in ourmarkets, requesting that we maintain the practice of dual trading.They understand the benefits it provides.''   The exchange, at the request of the Commodities Futures TradingCommission, had conducted its own study of dual trading. The studyconcluded the practice results in a better price for customer andadds to the liquidity of the market.   The study also contended that customers can choose to trade witha broker who does not trade for himself.   Brokers and traders at the Merc and the Board of Trade have beenunder investigation for two years by federal agents who suspectcustomers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars. Nocharges have resulted from the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
