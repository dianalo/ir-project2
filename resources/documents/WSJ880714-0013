The measure, passed on an 86-11 vote, also signals the end of the popular Urban Development Action Grant program.    Also yesterday, the Senate voted 92-4 to pass a $10.1 billion bill that would fund the Interior Department for the year beginning Oct. 1 and would extend a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along three U.S. coastlines.    The Senate Appropriations Committee report accompanying the HUD funding bill designates that $200 million of NASA's $3.6 billion research and development budget would go for the space station project next fiscal year. Lawmakers estimate that would be enough to maintain the program for about four months.    But Congress may find more money than that for the space station. A separate Pentagon spending bill pending in the Senate would provide $600 million for NASA activities associated with the military; lawmakers believe that would free an equal amount of NASA funds to sustain the space station through the coming fiscal year.    In addition, the House-passed bill that includes NASA's budget designates $902.4 million for the space station. Differences between that measure and the Senate bill passed yesterday are to be settled by a House-Senate conference committee, which could settle on a figure between the levels in the two bills.    While considering the measure, the Senate rejected two attempts to shift funds from NASA into other programs.    Like the House-passed legislation, the Senate bill doesn't include any new money for Urban Development Action Grants, citing the constraints of the deficit-cutting agreement reached last year between lawmakers and the Reagan administration.    For eight years, lawmakers have rejected President Reagan's attempts to kill the politically popular program, which provides grants as leverage to encourage private investment in development projects in economically distressed urban areas.    The president has also sought to rescind unspent funds previously appropriated for the grant program. But the appropriations committee reports accompanying both the House and Senate measures would direct the administration to keep the program alive for a while by using such appropriated funds, which total about $50 million.    Overall, the Senate-passed bill is $633.4 million lower than the House version and $409.7 million more than the Reagan administration had requested.    The Interior Department spending bill extends through Sept. 30, 1989, the prohibition on oil and gas drilling off the coasts of northern California, New England and western Florida. The House-passed version contains an identical provision. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has already delayed the sale of those drilling rights until next year.    While considering the measure, lawmakers voted 91-4 to approve a nonbinding provision condemning Nicaragua's Sandinista government for jailing protesters and closing an opposition newspaper and radio station. The amendment, offered by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), said lawmakers could resume military aid to the Contra rebels if the Sandinistas don't meet their pledge to restore democracy. The provision isn't part of the House bill.    The Senate bill doesn't include House language requiring special labels for certain films that have been colorized or edited.    Overall, the Senate-passed bill is $392.4 million more than the House version and $1.2 billion more than the Reagan administration requested. Differences between the two measures will be reconciled by a House-Senate conference. </TEXT></DOC>
