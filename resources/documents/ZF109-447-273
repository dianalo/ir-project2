(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has never attemptedanything as challenging as Space Station Freedom.andP;  In size and capabilities,the station dwarfs previous U.S.andP;  space vehicles.andP;  American astronauts, andcrew members from other countries, will live and work in the station,carrying out scientific and industrial experiments, tending to payloads andmaintaining station facilities.andM;NASA plans to assemble the station in a 220-mile-high equatorial orbit duringa four-year period, from 1995 to 1999, using the space shuttle to transportstructural elements and payloads.andP;  Will NASA's dream actually become reality?andO;There appear to be no overwhelming technical obstacles to the project, butthe station has come under attack on other grounds.andM;Take expense: NASA estimates $13 billion, in 1984 dollars, as the total costof station design, fabrication and integration.andP;  (President Reagan gave NASAthe go-ahead in 1984, so 1984 dollars were used in the estimation.)andM;But the $13-billion sticker price does not include the $600 million for spacestation definition studies, completed in 1987, or the cost of the shuttleflights needed to assemble the station.andM;The program has also been criticized by proponents of unmanned platforms andadvanced-automation techniques.andM;Still, &quot;There is a momentum to the space station in terms of current budgetcommitments, international interest and plans by experimenters that shouldsee us through,&quot; says Bill Raney, NASA's special assistant to the spacestation director in Washington, DC.andM;Questions and answersandM;SYSTEMS INTEGRATION tackled the space station story by first examining NASA'splans for the project.andP;  We then decided to focus on three critical areas:andM;*  What role do information systems play?andM;*  How are these systems designed and what can ground-based systemsintegrators learn from this massive effort?andM;*  How do NASA and its contractors handle changes in systems integrationplans stemming from technological advances, budget fluctuations and projectexperience?andM;To answer these questions, we talked with NASA officials and contractors atprogram offices in Washington; Reston, VA; and Houston.andM;Boeing Computer Services Inc., Grumman Corp., Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co.andO;and McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. were the prime contractors weinterviewed.andP;  Several major subcontractors were also contacted, includingFord Aerospace Corp., IBM Corp. and Intergraph Corp.andM;The program incorporates three interrelated information systems:andM;*  Software Support Environment (SSE): an integrated set of tools, standardsand procedures for developing and maintaining mission software.andM;*  Technical and Management Information System  (TMIS): a networked libraryof engineering and management data.andP;  All program participants are expected toeventually use TMIS.andM;*  Space Station Information System (SSIS): a collection of hardware,software and networks that promotes transparent communication of data withinthe space station and between the station and earth.andP;  The station's onboardData Management System (DMS) is one element of SSIS.andM;Work on these systems is already underway and, if it's successful, you canlook for these achievements:andM;*  The first distributed-processing network for a manned system in space-a100M-bit-per-second (bps), fiber-optic token-ring network;andM;*  Communications links that will allow researchers to &quot;teleoperate&quot;experiments on the station in real laboratories on earth;andM;*  The storage, management and exchange of complex engineering drawings andadministrative documents over a nationwide NASA network;andM;*  10 million lines of code for space station software-all written in acommon support environment in the Ada programming language.andM;Developing and integrating the information systems is a monumental task initself Furthermore, NASA and its contractors must manage the project overmany years.andP;  Several forces can influence program technical requirements overthese years.andM;Congress can always budget less than the administration asks for.andP;  &quot;When thathappens, we may slow down the schedule as a way of saving money, or we mightdecide some items are not affordable,&quot; says Clarence Pittman.andP;  He isassociate manager of Utilization andamp; Operations in NASA's Space Station FreedomProgram and Operations Office, Reston.andM;When the program took a budget hit of 15 percent for fiscal 1990, thereduction amounted to $300 million.andP;  One ripple effect: The scheduled date ofcomplete station assembly was put off 18 months.andM;Performance capabilities of hardware and software currently intended for thestation will inevitably change.andP;  &quot;We know that computers placed in thestation today will be obsolete by the time the project is complete,&quot; saysMark Hess, a NASA space station spokesman.andM;Government and industry networking standards used in the program, such as theOpen Systems Interconnection (OSI) and the fiber distributed data interface(FDDI), will likely evolve.andP;  And users may determine that some components ofthe information systems don't meet their ongoing needs, or don't work asanticipated.andM;Rules of the gameandM;NASA follows several principles to cope with such developments.andP;  Most arereflected in formal program requirements for the space station:andM;*  Use commercial, off-the-shelf products whenever possible.andP;  Why? It'susually less costly.andP;  And upgrading commercial technology is easier thanfiddling with custom-designed products.andM;*  Follow international standards in developing information systems.andP;  If noneare available for the components you are integrating, try national andindustry standards.andP;  Standards ease incorporating changing technologies.andM;*  Distribute common program elements like power, environmental and datasystems, throughout the station.andP;  Development time and money will be savedand crew training and station operations will be more efficient than if everycontractor goes his own way.andM;*  Tap equipment and skills already available in NASA facilities.andM;For instance, NASA's Program Support Communications Network (PSCN) plays aprominent role in the information systems used in design and operations.andO;PSCN is a collection of dedicated lines and satellite links that providedata, voice and video for administrative communications.andM;This network provides a variety of data rates, including an X.25, 9,600-bpspacket-switching service and a higher speed, multiprotocol implementationknown as PSCN/Internet (no relation to the federal government's Internetsystem).andP;  Further principles:andM;*  Provide for the merger of  hooksand-scars&quot;-NASA jargon for software andhardware options, respectively-into baseline design.andP;  The hooks-andscarsphilosophy is NASA's way of keeping station systems open to improvements fromfuture technology.andM;&quot;You don't want to do anything dumb today that prevents you from adding tothe space station for future missions,&quot; says Hess.andP;  For instance, powercables should carry more juice than presently needed in case station powerdemands increase.&quot;andM;*  Make data systems interoperable through all phases of the station's lifecycle.andP;  And make sure specifically developed application software istransportable among data systems, without source code modification.andM;*  Accommodate hardware and software upgrades to parts of the system withminimal disruption and without redesign of the remainder of the system.andM;Program requirementsandM;The space station program is guided by a well-worn set of managementprocedures used to initiate program changes and channel them through theappropriate  administrative  levels.andP;  NASA basically wants to ensure that anyproblems, whatever their origin, are identified as early as possible andsolved at the lowest management level possible.andM;The agency has designated three NASA management levels:andM;Level I: The Space Station Freedom Directorate, which is part of the Officeof Space Flight in the agency's Washington headquarters.andP;  This unitformulates overall policy and strategic management plans.andM;Level II: The Space Station Freedom Program and Operations Office in Reston,which oversees work on space station development, flight and ground systemsoperations and system interfaces.andM;Level III: Space Centers around the country.andP;  The Johnson Space Center inHouston; the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL; the GoddardSpace Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD; and the Lewis Research Center inCleveland have each been delegated design and development responsibilitiesfor one of four &quot;work packages.&quot;andM;The paper trail begins in the Washington office of NASA's administrator,which issues the fundamental go-ahead for programs though a Program ApprovalDocument (PAD).andP;  A PAD says you can go to work.andM;From here on, space station requirements are spelled out in ever-greaterdetail as they descend through NASA's management levels:andM;Level I: A Program Requirements Document (PRD) covers general objectives,requirements, budgets and the various milestones.andP;  &quot;This document asks, whatdo we mean by a space station?&quot; says Philip Davis, deputy manager of theManagement Integration Office in the Space Station Freedom Program andOperations Office.andM;For example, the PRD says the station shall support eight astronauts andshall be an international program.andP;  The PRD defines to the next level what issupposed to be worked on.&quot;andM;Level II: A Program Definition and Requirements Document (PDRD) establishesmore detailed requirements for program design, development and operationalcapability.andM;Level III: Participants contribute Architecture, Baseline and InterfaceControl Documents to this process, as well as Contract End ItemSpecifications.andP;  An Interface Control Document defines what information is tobe exchanged, in what format, between two or more systems.andP;  Such a documentis being prepared for transmitting software documentation from the SoftwareSupport Environment to the Technical and Management Information System.andM;NASA holds periodic design reviews to appraise how the program is developingand what changes should be made.andP;  &quot;Assurance that program standards are beingmet is handled by regular reviews between each contractor and thework-package office at the Space Center to which the contractor reports,&quot;says Fred Haise, president of Grumman Corp.'s Space Station Program SupportDivision.andP;  &quot;As the program's pace picks up, such reviews may take placeweekly or even daily.&quot; Moving up the lineandM;A series of peer-group design reviews are carried out for individual programelements, as well as for the entire project.andP;  Such reviews take place atdifferent stages of a project's evolution and may involve many parties whouse a given system or who are affected by its development.andP;  Reviews areconducted under the auspices of Control Boards at each administrative leveland for individual systems.andP;  Among these reviews:andM;1.andP;  A Program Requirements Review (PRR) provides the final definition ofspecifications, cost guidelines and other requirements contractors need tocarry out preliminary designs.andP;  This review has been completed.andM;2.andP;  The Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs) examine how well programrequirements are being satisfied.andP;  PDRs study such matters as trade-offsamong systems designs, test-bed and mock-up fabrication and technologydevelopment.andP;  Such reviews can lead to changes in requirements.andM;&quot;A host of outsiders, including NASA experts, system users and astronauts mayjoin in a review,&quot; says Clint Hundley, program manager for the space stationat IBM Corp.'s Federal Sector Division, speaking of PDRs carried out for hiscompany's onboard computer system.andP;  &quot;This is everybody's chance to get theirrequests into your design.&quot;andM;Hundley says: &quot;We might be asked, for instance, to add memory or provide adifferent display.andP;  We then give an estimate to the relevant control boardsof the impact of such requests on our costs and schedules.&quot;andM;Special assistant Raney adds, &quot;PDRs smoke out the places where interfacesbetween equipment, for example, may be a problem.andP;  It's useful to catch suchthings at this stage since we haven't yet spent a lot on hardware.&quot;andM;3.andP;  The Critical Design Reviews  (CDRS) take place when approximately 90percent of the design drawings are completed.andP;  This is the product acontractor plans to build.andP;  &quot;Again, everybody can see if you designed whatyou said you would,&quot; says Hundley.andP;  Completion of a CDR leads directly tolarge-scale manufacturing and testing of flight hardware.andM;RID decisionsandM;An important part of the review ritual is submission of Review ItemDiscrepancies (RIDS) by any concerned party.andP;  These forms questionrequirements and implementations.andP;  Final decisions on RIDs are made by theproper control board.andP;  A board can refuse to alter a requirement, alter it asthe RID suggests or alter it otherwise.andM;&quot;You can get hundreds of RIDs during the review process,&quot; says Linn Ready,deputy program manager of the SSE System Project of Lockheed Missiles andamp; SpaceCo. &quot;They vary from trivial word changes in a requirements document torecommendations of major design changes.andP;  Approved RIDs give us technicaldirection.&quot;andM;Change Requests (CRs) are an additional tool for adapting the program totransformed conditions.andP;  Such requests typically ask for modifications inoriginal contract specifications.andP;  They can be submitted by contractors atany time.andM;&quot;Change requests are often triggered by budget reductions,&quot; says Raney.andO;&quot;When a drop occurs, we and the contractors must work to sort out reviseddelivery plans, figure out the cost of new technical options, analyze howchanges in one system might affect others and negotiate contract revisions.&quot;andM;In the following pages, SYSTEMS INTEGRATION takes a close look at SpaceStation Freedom's evolving information systems.andM;Space Station Freedom is designed as a 508-foot-long integrated truss withattached laboratory and habitation modules, solar panels, external payloadunits and a mobile servicing system.andP;  The solar panels will produce 75kilowatts of power, supporting pressurized modules in which eight crewmembers will serve for up to six months.andP;  Large nodes connect the modules andcontain command and control systems.andP;  In this conceptual drawing, the spaceshuttle is preparing to dock at a node.andM;17 steps to SpaceandM;Station FreedomandM;1.andP;  1960: NASA holds Manned SpaceandM;Station SymposiumandM;2.andP;  1963: NASA initiates informal requirementsandM;reviewandM;3.andP;
