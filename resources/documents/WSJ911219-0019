The retailer of jewelry and gift items said the IRS is&quot;mistaken.&quot; Its chief financial officer, James Fernandez,said, &quot;We're willing to go to Tax Court.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Tiffany, in a quarterly filing with the Securities andExchange Commission, said it is in discussions with the IRSconcerning the audit. Mr. Fernandez said the audit of itsreturns from 1985 through 1988 is still &quot;very preliminary.&quot;The company said in the filing that any amount that may bepayable as a result of the audit won't have a material effecton its financial position.   The dispute stems from deductions taken in connection withthe company's leveraged buy-out from Avon Products Inc. in1984 and refinanced LBO debt incurred before the company'sinitial public offering in May 1987. The company said IRSagents believe the interest expense deducted should insteadbe characterized as &quot;nondeductible distributions tostockholders.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
