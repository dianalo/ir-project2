The 3,500-word draft was being debated, revised and voted onlater today by a 16-member platform drafting committee meeting onthe eve of the first gathering of the full 186-member platformcommittee.   The draft incorporates language on a dozen issues thatrepresentatives of likely nominee Michael Dukakis and his onlyremaining challenger, Jesse Jackson, agreed to two weeks ago indrafting sessions on Mackinac Island, Mich.   But in every significant area of dispute, it is Dukakis'preferences and not Jackson's, that are embodied in the preliminarydraft. Jackson has said he may fight to the convention floor inAtlanta next month for planks endorsing higher taxes on the richand a freeze on the Pentagon budget.   Ted Sorensen, the onetime John F. Kennedy speechwriter whopenned an earlier platform ``discussion paper'' for DemocraticParty chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., said in an interview today, ``It'sfairly clear now this will be the shortest platform in over ahundred years.''   ``It will be a thematic, readable platform. It will not have thetraditional, negative cast. Reagan, Republican, Bush _ those wordsaren't even mentioned,'' said Sorensen, who also helped write thisdraft.   The draft is headed ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope.''It pledges party leaders and elected officials ``to restorecompetence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executivebranch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''   It calls for ``more stable defense budgets,'' appointment of adrug czar and ``maintaining the special relationship with Israel''while pursuing peace in the Middle East along the lines laid out inthe Camp David Accords.   Dukakis, who has ruled out any talk in the platform of raisingtaxes, gave a terse reply Thursday in Fall River, Mass., when askedif he supported Jackson's call for a Palestinian homeland.   ``No, of course not,'' said the Massachusetts governor andcertain nominee.   Several state Democratic parties have called forself-determination for Palestinians, saying the issue should bepart of the platform.   The 16-member platform drafting committee headed by Rep. WilliamH. Gray of Philadelphia was planning to vote late today on apreliminary draft culled from position papers agreed to in thefirst round of drafting sessions two weeks ago on Mackinac Island,Mich.   Dukakis's representatives there refused to endorse higher taxeson the rich and insisted the platform call for a stable Pentagonbudget, not the freeze Jesse Jackson wants.   Gray's panel is essentially a subcommittee of the full186-member platform committee, which will hold its first meetingshere Saturday and Sunday.   The full panel, chaired by Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard,will try to craft the document that the entire convention will beasked to approve on July 19. Jackson has more than a quarter of thedelegates, enough to force a floor fight on any issues he chooses.   Jackson huddled in Washington on Thursday with his conventionand platform strategists.   Ron Brown, director of Jackson's convention operation, saiddiscssion on the Palestinian issue is still going on between theJackson and Dukakis camps.   Asked if Jackson would insist on acceptance of a platform plankcalling for a Palestinian homeland, Brown said, ``We want languagewe can accept.''   Pressed on the Palestinian state question, he added: ``Wehaven't drawn any line in the sand.''   Dukakis told reporters, ``I support direct negotiations betweenIsrael and its neighbors and responsible Palestinians who ...recognize Israel's right to exist within its borders.''   Jackson reportedly told his lieutenants in the privateWashington meeting that he expects to see all the disputes settledand the party unified coming out of Atlanta.   Jackson, asked why he had not endorsed Dukakis as have thegovernor's other former rivals, said, ``Kennedy did not stop beforeNew York in 1980. Hart did not stop before San Francisco in 1984.''   He said the others may have ``thrown in the towel in the face ofadversity,'' but ``I'm tough ... I will never surrender.''</TEXT></DOC>
