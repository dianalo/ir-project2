Microsoft rival Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a small earningsgain, while Wang Laboratories Inc. predicted it would post theworst quarterly loss in two years in its third fiscal quarter.   Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said it earned $41.1 million, or73 cents per share, in the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, upfrom $37.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenuerose 22 percent to $197 million from $161.8 million a year earlier.   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Microsoft'searnings rose 33.3 percent to $184.1 million, or $2.23 a share,from $140.9 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose38.8 percent to $583.3 million from $420.4 million a year earlier.   Microsoft's stock plunged last month when the company predictedan earnings decline, the first such drop since the company wentpublic three years ago.   Some shareholders complained last month that they weren'tadequately warned about the company's difficulties. Now it turnsout that the warnings were overstated. March results turned outbetter than expected, according to Pam Edstrom, a spokeswoman atMicrosoft's public relations firm.   ``At least this news was better than the other news,'' she said.   Lowell, Mass.-based Wang Laboratories said it expects to losesome $55 million in its third quarter. Last week, Wang announcedplans to drop its worldwide payroll to 28,500 by June 1990. It had31,700 employees in November, when it began a policy of not fillingvacancies.   Wang plans to release its actual earnings figure Friday, twodays behind schedule.   In a statement released Wednesday, the computer manufacturersaid unit sales and total revenues will be ``approximately equal''to that of the previous quarter and the third quarter of fiscal1988. Wang's sales totalled $767.9 million a year ago and $760.7million in 1989's second quarter.   Wang blamed this quarter's loss on increased discounting ofproduct sales, lower maintentance revenue in the United States, anda shift to lower-margin sales of personal computers. The firm'smain business is minicomputers.   The firm has followed 1988's $92 million gain with disappointingprofits of $13.1 million and $1 million the first two quarters ofthis fiscal year.   Ashton-Tate, of Torrance, Calif., said its net income rose to$11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, from $11.1 million, or 43 centsa share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $89.8 million from $72.4million a year earlier.   The company attributed the flat earnings to increased researchand development and sales and marketing expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
