Menasco, 71, a World War II veteran who fought in New Guinea, had anoperation for colon cancer and was told that regular checkups were critical.Recently, however, the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital that he hascounted on to keep him alive refused to schedule an appointment.;   &quot;I askedthem when I could get one,&quot; said Menasco, a short, wiry man who commands alocal Veterans of Foreign Wars post. &quot;They said they didn't know. They didn'tknow where or when.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  V.A. HOSPITAL CLOSING IGNITES VETERANS' IRE,DOCTORS' REVOLT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The cold shoulder did not completely surprise Menasco because he, likethousands of other veterans in the largest V.A. service area in California,knew that the V.A. hospital here was about to close. This extraordinary event-- the number of inpatients dropped to 14 last week -- has brought a roar ofoutrage from veterans and a doctors' revolt unlike anything the veteransagency has seen in a generation.;   Among the rules of American politics, noneis more sacred than this: Thou shalt not close a V.A. hospital. The last timeWashington gave the order was 1965, shortly before the Vietnam War began toflood the country with injured veterans. No one has since dared to violate thecommandment.;   That the department announced in August its intention to closethe hospital by Dec. 7, ironically the 50th anniversary of the attack on PearlHarbor, is a measure of either the Bush administration's determination to cutcosts in all departments or of the political courage of Edward J. Derwinski,the first secretary of veterans affairs.;   Opinions about what motivated thedecision are legion, with few people here accepting Derwinski's expressedconcern about the earthquake threat to the hospital's ill-designed mainbuilding. But all agree that nearly everyone involved is unhappy and thatmedical care for thousands of Northern Californians will be disrupted for sometime.;   &quot;The reduced access to medical care will cause patients to die,&quot; saida resolution signed by a large majority of physicians at the hospital, whichhas 359 beds and 1,200 employees. &quot;Patients with chest pain or rectal bleedingwill put off seeking treatment due to distance to hospitals and waiting listsfor clinic visits.&quot;;   The hospital and its satellite clinics in Redding,Sacramento and Oakland serve about 450,000 veterans. The hospital hadestablished a reputation for efficiency: &quot;We handle 17 percent of the state'sveterans with only 8 percent of the state V.A. budget,&quot; one doctor said. Butwith the doors about to close, services have been hurt.;   Derwinski, in atelephone interview, said that he understands the hardship and dislocation hisdecision has caused but that he had no choice. &quot;The buck stops with me,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The safety feature was something that I could not ignore. If there isnot a major earthquake in the next 20 years, then I'm willing to say I made abad decision . . . but I felt I couldn't put lives at risk.&quot;;   Departmentofficials said they are haunted by 46 deaths at the V.A. hospital in SanFernando, a suburb of Los Angeles, during a major earthquake in 1971. Mete A.Sozen, a civil engineer on the department's advisory committee on structuralsafety, told the agency that &quot;the structure of Building No. 1 (at Martinez)has a critical flaw. A major structural wall is discontinued at the firststory (and) total collapse of the building is probable in the event of theanticipated earthquake.&quot;;   Martinez Mayor Mike Menesini called the seismicargument &quot;a big lie,&quot; and many doctors at the hospital agree. A dozen of themmet a reporter to offer reams of material on previous seismic studies, theearthquake danger to other Bay Area hospitals that plan to remain open and thepolitics of medical care for the poor and aged.;   They noted that thedepartment had seismic evaluations done at Martinez in 1973, 1983 and 1989with no immediate recommendations for drastic action. They said a structuralengineer the department hired in 1989 said the building did not meet currentseismic codes but was &quot;one of the safer older buildings in Contra CostaCounty,&quot; built on bedrock and undamaged after the Loma Prieta earthquake in1989.;   &quot;Eighty percent of this is politics,&quot; one doctor said. Many of themsaid Martinez was vulnerable because the Bush administration does not like thearea's congressman, George Miller, D-Pleasant Hill, and because Sen. AlanCranston, D-Calif., usually a powerful defender of veterans' interests andV.A. hospitals, had been weakened by illness and the savings and loanscandal.;   The doctors and staff members opposing the closing want the agencyto renovate the facility, which an early estimate said would cost $40 million.Agency spokeswoman Donna St. John said the actual renovation figure is $283million, more than the estimated $280 million cost of the agency's announcedplan to build a new 243-bed hospital and a 120-bed nursing home on the campusof the University of California, Davis Medical School.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Martinez  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911020  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  827  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 20, 199100294179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
