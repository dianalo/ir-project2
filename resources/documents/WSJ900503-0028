The tiny wood-products and insulation company has a marketvalue of not quite $40 million, but shareholders are raisinga bigtime stink over a board-approved plan to double theamount of options, stock awards and stock-appreciation rightsgoing to company insiders.</LP><TEXT>   When Fibreboard was spun off in 1988 from LouisianaPacific, its board approved a stock option and rights plancovering 350,000 shares, equivalent to 9% of its 3.9 millionshares outstanding. Now it wants to amend that plan bydoubling the number to 700,000, or 18% of the sharescurrently outstanding -- subject to a vote of shareholders.   The meeting will be held in Roxboro, N.C., the site of asmall Fibreboard plant that is 2,500 miles from the company'shome base in Concord, Calif.   &quot;Management and directors are feasting on the value of thecompany,&quot; says Jery Chambers, a Buffalo, N.Y., investmentmanager with Courier Capital whose clients own 170,000shares. &quot;We're going down to scream and yell.&quot;   Lawrence Hart, the chairman and the sole managementdirector, says, &quot;The idea is to give an equity stake in thecompany so our own personal finances are very tied in withthat of the company.&quot;   However, Fibreboard's managers and directors haven'tinvested more than a pittance of their own in Fibreboard. Itsexecutive officers and directors had purchased only 7,062shares, or 0.18% of the company, as of the March 29 proxystatement. Mr. Hart says the total has risen since then, buthe won't say by how much.   Graef Crystal, a compensation specialist and professor atthe Haas School of Business at the University of Californiaat Berkeley, says &quot;the percentage of shares {in Fibreboard'splan} is awesomely large. The rule of thumb is 5% of theshares outstanding.&quot;   Mr. Hart responds that Fibreboard is an unusual case andthat compensation is adequate and comparable to that of other&quot;high-risk, start-up companies.&quot;   Fibreboard's lumber operations actually are longstanding;it isn't a start-up venture in the sense that a high-techfirm is. But the company does entail plenty of risk.   The company, a former asbestos-products manufacturer,lives under a cloud of litigation. However, a trial court hasruled that Fibreboard's insurers are liable for at least thebulk of anticipated claims. The bottom line is that whileFibreboard isn't yet out of the woods, the asbestos cloudappears to be clearing.   On the positive side, the company owns 117,000 acres oftimber that have a book value of $30 million but could beworth $140 million. Last year, it sold 27,500 acres ofrelatively lower quality timber and fetched almost $1,200 anacre. It also owns a ski resort on the northern side of LakeTahoe, Calif., which is on the market and could be worthdouble its $19 million book value.   Those values won't be realized overnight, but they suggestthat if the asbestos cloud does abate, Fibreboard's stock,currently trading at 9 7/8, could become much more valuable.   Donald Miller, managing partner of Greylock FinancialPartnership, who says he owns 62,000 shares, says the optionspave the way for management and directors to reap a smallfortune. And, Mr. Miller notes, the options are beingproposed at a time when the stock is depressed, down fromlast year's high of 19 1/4, and trading at 25% of stated bookvalue, which is $36 a share.   That means the exercise price will be cheaper. Some of theshares, however, are in the form of restricted stock awards-- stock that is given away free to managers who hang on forthree years.   Such awards, Mr. Crystal says, require of managers thatthey &quot;breathe in and out on the company payroll.&quot; Mr. Hart,who has so far been awarded 35,000 in restricted sharerights, says &quot;this gives me an incentive to perform&quot; wellenough to stay employed. He also says recruiting managers anddirectors for an asbestos-plagued company is hard, andcompensation levels therefore are justified. Mr. Hart,incidentally, received a 118% increase in salary and bonuslast year to $454,000; he also was given a golden parachuteplan.   Mr. Miller says there is a larger problem of &quot;corporategovernance&quot; at Fibreboard. Fibreboard's four outsidedirectors, who sit on the compensation committee, eachreceive options on at least 2,000 shares and a $10,000stipend annually. Mr. Miller questions whether thisinfluences their opinion of Fibreboard's option plan.   Several directors couldn't be reached or wouldn't comment.   E. Judge Elderkin, a Fibreboard director and a partner ina San Francisco law firm that represents Fibreboard, is onthe board's compensation committee. He says through aspokeswoman that it is inappropriate for him to respond andrefers questions to Mr. Hart.   ---   Fibreboard   (AMEX; Symbol: FBD)                                                                                                          Business: Wood products and insulation                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1989:   Sales: $218.1 million   Net income: $5.3 million; $1.35 a share*                                                                                                          First quarter, March 31, 1990:   Per share earnings: 51 cents vs. 91 cents*                                                                                                          Averge daily trading volume:   9,526 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 3.9 million                                                                                                          *Full year includes 38 cents a share and year-ago quarterincludes 26 cents a share of profit from discontinuedoperations.</TEXT></DOC>
