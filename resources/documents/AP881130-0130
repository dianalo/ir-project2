He said the two men have a ``relationship that transcendspolitics.''   President-elect Bush, a Republican, and Jackson, who sought theDemocratic presidential nomination, had spoken critically of eachother during the long campaign.   However, Bush said today, ``The campaign is over. I have noarguments with the way that Rev. Jackson conducted himself towardme.''   ``There will be times ... when I will ask for his suggestions''during the Bush administration, he said. ``He has some very goodideas.''   Bush said that the issue of Willie Horton, the murderer whosefurlough from a Massachusetts prison was used in GOP campaign ads,came up during today's meeting and that he told Jackson he had notintended to make it a racial issue.   Jackson, asked how he felt about Bush's explanation, repeated hisview that the TV ads did incite racial fears, but said Bush hadassured him ``that was not his intention.''   The Democrat said the most important aspect of the meeting wasthe ``openness by President-elect Bush to discuss a broad range ofmatters.''   Earlier today, Bush met with leaders of environmental groups anddisplayed an attitude that one of the leaders said showed a ``nightand day'' difference from the Reagan years.   Spokesmen for the ``Blueprint for the Environment,'' a coalitionof some 30 environmental groups that presented Bush with detailedproposals, were uniformly positive in characterizing Bush's responseto their goals.   However, they acknowledged they had received no commitments fromhim other than that he would consider their proposals and wouldassign key Cabinet nominees to meet with them.   One of the environmental groups' leaders, Jay Hair of theNational Wildlife Federation, said he had told the vice president,``Mr. Bush, read my lips: Protect the environment.''   Hair said Bush reacted positively to the wordplay on his ownno-taxes campaign phrase, replying, ``I will, I will.''   John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council,said that based on the positive reaction of Bush and his aides tothe group, ``it's hard to believe that President Bush will notaddress these issues. We will be on his team.''   Hair said ``it's simply night and day'' from the Reagan yearsduring which Bush served as vice president. Hair said the early1980s were a time of ``ideological shrillness, anti-environmentalactions and lack of stewardship'' in the administration. ``I didn'tsense any of that this morning.''   The leaders said Bush did not directly address their proposed $5billion in increased spending on environmental programs, withemphasis on actions to deal with a global warming trend, or thetotal $19 billion in revenue increases that they proposed through acombination of cutbacks and taxation measures.   Bush did not meet with reporters after the session with theenvironmental groups' leaders.   His meetings with them and with Jackson are part of afence-mending effort that has included a session with vanquished GOPrival Bob Dole and a planned meeting on Friday with Dukakis, thedefeated Democratic presidential nominee.   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said the Jackson meeting was ``inkeeping with what George Bush has traditionally done, which is to beopen and talk to people that are interested and concerned.''   In another overture to a prominent Democrat, Bush called theSenate's newly chosen majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, tocongratulate him shortly after Tuesday's secret-ballot electionamong Senate Democrats.   Also on Tuesday, Bush told Senate Republican leaders that he willseek speedy confirmation of his Cabinet.   Participants in a private meeting at the Capitol said Bush toldthe senators he hopes any ``honeymoon period'' with Congress canyield a federal budget compromise.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said Bush indicated he wanted to meetwith ``a bipartisan group to discuss his thoughts'' beforesubmitting a budget outline of his own.   However, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the SenateFinance Committee and the 1988 Democratic vice presidentialcandidate, said Bush should send his own budget to the lawmakers.   ``This will be his first test of leadership. He has to show whathe believes in _ national defense, Medicare, revenues? He has tospeak to the principal points of the budget. That's part of theprice of leadership,'' Bentsen said.</TEXT></DOC>
