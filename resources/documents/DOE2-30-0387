<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0387 </DOCNO><TEXT>While most of the fundamental combustion experiments were performed witha stream of coal/char particles and practical burners which used denseclouds of drops and particles in sprays, the theory used to interpretthe experimental data was essentially based on the individual particlecombustion model (IPC). As opposed to the IPC model, a group theory isnow emerging for the combustion modeling of a cloud of particles. Insimple terms, the group behavior implies the formation of a single flamearound a large number of drops/particles rather than flame around eachindividual drop/particle. In broader terms, such a behavior could alsobe interpreted as the change in burning characteristics due to collectivebehavior of a cloud of particles. The objectives of the program are (1)to formulate a group theory for the combustion modeling of a cloud ofparticles, (2) to obtain results on the pyrolysis yield and the ignitionand combustion characteristics under cloud conditions, and (3) to comparethe results with the experimental data reported elsewhere. An introductionto group combustion theory (GC) is given. A group combustion theory hasbeen formulated and results were obtained for the quasi-steady (QS) groupcombustion of a cloud of char particles and non-steady (NS) group combustionof coal particles. The QS results for a spherical cloud of char particlesare given in terms of a dimensionless group combustion number G.</TEXT></DOC>
