Military headquarters in Kampala had ordered local journalistsnot to report the mutiny and several people had been detained inthe capital for discussing it publicly, said officers in theUgandan army who spoke on condition of anonymity.   At least 200 mutineers of the 19th Artillery Regiment and the8th Infantry Battalion were slain in clashes with 3,000 loyaltroops April 7-8 before rebel units surrendered, the sources said.The two units are based near the Ugandan capital of Kampala.   About 700 mutineers were captured and detained by militarypolice at Luzira prison in Kampala, they said.   On April 11, the presidential convoy was ambushed on the 22-milehighway from Kampala to the State House in Entebbe. Mutineerskilled at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of threemilitary trucks, the sources said.   But Museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car.He had flown by helicopter from Kampala to the State House andevidently had sent the seven-vehicle convoy along the road withouthim, the sources said.   The attackers escaped.   The sources said they belong to a group of dissident officerswanting Museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies,improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 Libyan and 250 NorthKorean military instructors from the former British colony in EastAfrica.   They said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling Museveni.   The military command in Kampala, contacted by telephone fromNairobi, would not confirm or deny the reports.   Telephones at State House alternately went unanswered or werebusy.   There have been no previous reported attempts to assassinteMuseveni, who seized power Jan. 27, 1986, ending a five-year bushwar against civilian President Milton Obote and the military juntathat ousted Obote in July 1985.   The sources said the captives had not been ill-treated and wouldbe sent to re-education camps at Entebbe, Kyankwanzi west ofKampala and Mobuku near the Zaire border. The government set up thecamps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed intothe army or allowed to return to civilian life.   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,including military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted insurgenciessince August 1986 and Museveni's National Resistance Army has beenbattling several rebel groups.   On Saturday, Museveni signed a peace agreement with thecommander of the largest rebel group, Lt. Col. John Angelo Okelloof the northern-based Uganda People's Democratic Army. But EricOtema Allimadi, the rebels' leader in exile in London, rejected theaccord in advance.   Museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement witha smaller rebel group fighting in the east, the Uganda People'sArmy.</TEXT></DOC>
