Quayle also repeated his call for Cuba to halt arms shipments torebels fighting the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador.   But the vice president himself avoided contact with Castro atThursday's inauguration of Brazil's new president.   Quayle told a news conference he had discussed the matter ofCuba with other Latin leaders during his week-long trip throughSouth America.   ``We have encouraged all people who have any contact with FidelCastro to urge him to stop the war in El Salvador, to stopfunding'' the well-organized guerilla movement.   Asked what he had discussed with Nicaragua's outgoing PresidentDaniel Ortega the day before, Quayle said that the disarmament ofOrtega's ruling Sandinistas when they leave power is a matter ofconcern to the United States.   ``There are reports that many arms are being shipped out to theSandinistas that are taking them to their homes or taking them tothe hills, ready to fight again at another time. That would be amost unfortunate development,'' with the pending transfer of powerto Violeta Chamorro, who defeated Ortega in the Feb. 25 election.   At the inauguration, Castro entered the hall just ahead ofQuayle and was immediately surrounded as he made his way up thecrowded aisle to his front-row seat.   Quayle trailed several yards back. He greeted a few people inthe aisle and edged past the clot around Castro to his own seatfour places down the front row.   In his news conference before leaving Brazil, Quayle continued adrumbeat against Castro.   ``We also urge anyone who is in contact with Castro to ask himwhen he's going to have elections. ... Elections have been heldelsewhere in Latin America and Cuba should be no exception.''   Quayle spoke about Cuba in talks Thursday with Collor and withBolivia's president, Jaime Paz Zamora, who sat next to Castro atthe inauguration.   Castro, flanked on the other side by a representative of theVatican, chatted frequently with Paz Zamora during Collor's lengthyspeech.   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said Quayle had askedCollor to urge Castro to bring democracy to Cuba. Quayle earlierwon assurances from President Carlos Menem that Argentina would tryto exert pressure on Castro as well.   Quayle is due to return to Washington on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
