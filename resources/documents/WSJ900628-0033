In his first interview with an American newspaper innearly six years, Mr. Hussein, who has a reputation forbrutality, spoke pointedly and unemotionally of hisdetermination to stand up to any Israeli aggression againstArab countries, even if it means war. &quot;We shall respond to anIsraeli attack whenever it comes and wherever,&quot; he said. &quot;IfIsrael attacks one country and there is no response, then thesecond country to be attacked surely will be Iraq.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   His remarks come at a time when fears of a new Mideast warare high. Those concerns have been stoked lately by theformation of a new hardline government in Israel, continuedPalestinian uprisings in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, andPresident Bush's suspension last week of the U.S. dialoguewith the Palestine Liberation Organization. Jordan's KingHussein, in an interview last weekend, likened the risingtension to the hair-trigger period before the June 1967Arab-Israeli war.   Both King Hussein and President Hussein believe thePalestinian uprising in Israel and the wave of Soviet Jewsemigrating to the country have convinced Israel's governmentthat it must find a pretext to push Palestinians out of theWest Bank and into neighboring Jordan. Some of King Hussein'sministers anxiously describe scenarios that could lead towar, including an Israeli attack on either Jordan or Libyafollowed by an Iraqi military response.   For some months, the Iraqi president has been threateningto &quot;scorch half of Israel&quot; with poison gas if it attacksIraq. At a distance, those claims sometimes sound likehotheaded rhetoric. But up close, during a 3 1/2-hourinterview at his heavily guarded presidential palace, Mr.Hussein spoke with almost clinical detachment of a war inwhich Israeli nuclear weapons would be offset by Iraq'schemical capability.   As is usually the case with Saddam Hussein, securityduring the interview was tight. Briefcases and purses aren'tallowed in his presence, and even ballpoint pens and notepadsare carefully scrutinized. The meeting was held in an ornatemarble room, where a bevy of presidential aides took notesand two cameras filmed throughout. Mr. Hussein, a reclusiveman who hasn't traveled to the West in more than a decade,revealed little about his private life. Asked how he relaxes,the president, dressed in a gray business suit, appearedgenuinely surprised. &quot;He's never been asked that before,&quot;explained his interpreter, while staff aides whispered thathe should say he goes fishing.   In discussing the Mideast, Mr. Hussein was careful totread the line between toughness and outright aggressiveness.While he called Israel an &quot;evil entity&quot; and termed the U.S.&quot;indifferent&quot; to Mideast concerns, he stressed repeatedlythat Iraq will strike only if Israel strikes first.   While all this war talk may be meant simply to goad theU.S. into reassessing its Mideast policy, Saddam Hussein'sremarks can't be lightly dismissed. He possesses chemicalweapons -- he has used them before against Iranians anddissident Iraqis -- and a brash self-confidence largely borneof surviving his eight-year war with Iran. Furthermore, heenjoys a freedom to act seemingly unchecked by any forceinside or outside Iraq, an oil-rich nation of 17 million hehas ruled since 1979. Finally, he possesses a million-man,battle-hardened army and plenty of weapons; for the past fiveyears, Iraq has led the world in arms imports.   Mr. Hussein insisted that future wars won't, as in thepast, lead to quick Israeli victories. &quot;If Israel were toconduct an aggression, then the confrontation must be long,&quot;he said. And, if the fighting is long, &quot;the outcome will notbe one Israel desires.&quot; Asked how a long war is possiblegiven that Israel has nuclear weapons, he said, &quot;Iraq is inpossession of binary chemical weapons. Our scientists andmilitary men calculate this is sufficient enough to deter anIsraeli nuclear attack.&quot;   Whether right or wrong, both Saddam Hussein and KingHussein appear to have convinced each other -- and want toconvince the U.S. -- that Israel is preparing to push theremaining one million or so Palestinians into Jordan. BothArab leaders see Iraq as the best deterrent and the only realdefense should Israel attack. And both leaders insist theU.S., and to a lesser extent Great Britain, are conducting acampaign to smear Iraq and thus create international supportfor an Israeli attack. &quot;They opened fire,&quot; he claimed,referring to the U.S. and Britain.   A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said theministry couldn't comment on Mr. Hussein's remarks until ithad seen a full text. A spokesman for Israeli DefenseMinister Moshe Arens also declined to respond directly butsaid, &quot;Everybody knows that Israel has no aggressiveintentions toward the Arab world and is ready to negotiatedirectly for peace. We pray every day we won't have a new warin the Middle East.&quot;   However far-fetched President Hussein's fears may seem,the risk is that, either deliberately or inadvertently, Arableaders could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Jordan'sKing Hussein, who was the Iraqi president's first and mostloyal supporter during the long Iraq-Iran war, seems to behuddling even closer to him as Jordan's fears of Israelmount. For instance, King Hussein refused in an interview torule out inviting Iraqi troops into his country. While hisintent would be protection against Israel, Iraq's soldiers inJordan almost certainly would be seen by Israel as aprovocation.   Israel's new government has fanned Arab fears by issuingpolicy guidelines which state that the government &quot;will placeimmigration and absorption {of immigrants} foremost among itsnational objectives.&quot; Arabs are further aroused by thedeclaration that, &quot;The eternal right of the Jewish people toEretz Yisrael is not subject to question, and is intertwinedwith its right to security and peace.&quot; Eretz Yisrael isgenerally seen to include both Israel and the West Bankoccupied by Israel since its victory in the 1967 war.   &quot;If they've prepared such a scheme, then aggression mustoccur,&quot; the Iraqi president said. &quot;You cannot avoid war.&quot;   Indeed, there is little talk anywhere in the region of apeace process, particularly since President Bush suspendedtalks with the PLO. The U.S. action was taken afterPalestinian guerrillas launched an unsuccessful raid on theIsraeli coast last month.   Whatever comes, Saddam Hussein is the Arab leader towatch. Throughout the interview, he answered questionspatiently, including those about his international reputationas the &quot;Butcher of Baghdad.&quot; His reply: &quot;Weakness doesn'tassure achieving the objectives required by a leader.&quot;   Mr. Hussein's suspicion of the U.S. is always evident. Hecalled on the Bush administration to withdraw U.S. ships fromthe Persian Gulf, arguing they no longer are needed toprotect oil tankers from Iranian aggression. Therefore, hebelieves, they must either be spying for Israel or perhapsplanning to provoke a new Iraq-Iran naval confrontation totie up Iraqi forces.   In Washington, a State Department official dismissed Mr.Hussein's allegations and said U.S. ships are in the PersianGulf because of &quot;vital U.S. interests that we have in thewaterways of the Gulf,&quot; and not to stir up trouble betweenIran and Iraq. He added that the U.S. has been &quot;veryinvolved&quot; in working for peace in the region.   Mr. Hussein also kept open the possibility of using an oilembargo as a weapon, though today's glutted market wouldlimit its immediate effectiveness. After Saudi Arabia, Iraqpossesses the world's largest oil reserves. Only the U.S.,the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia have greater productioncapacity.   &quot;We do not want to use the oil weapon unless forced to doso in defense of our rights and interests,&quot; he said. But,citing the U.S. and Britain's seizure this spring of largepipes destined for Iraq and believed intended forconstruction of a &quot;big gun&quot; capable of lobbing missiles longdistances, he added, &quot;If the great powers use any opportunitythey see available to suppress others and to reap benefits atothers' expense, then the others will find themselves in aposition that will force them to use any means available.&quot;   As Saddam Hussein sees it, the easing of tensions betweenSoviets and Americans has heightened Arab unity, for Arabnations are no longer divided between two superpower camps.He said the Cold War's end has also increased America's sensethat it can dictate Mideast policy. &quot;It is now clear the U.S.can exert influence over the Soviets and make them abandonany position contrary to the U.S.,&quot; he said. &quot;So, Americathinks it can cast things anyway it wants in the region andin alliance with Israel can suppress any voice in support ofArab rights.&quot;   But the president's primary point is that the world --especially the U.S., Britain and Israel -- is misjudging andunderestimating Iraq. Other countries' assessment, heinsisted, is that Iraq's economy, people and leaders are tooexhausted from eight years of fighting Iran to &quot;indulge in anew war.&quot; Furthermore, he said, these nations fear that Iraq,absent war, will develop into a powerful example of politicaland economic independence that other Arabs could emulate.&quot;The way we see it, they thought this is the time and not anyother when the assault against Iraq must be made.&quot;   He added, &quot;Their assessment is totally wrong. This doesnot mean the people of Iraq do not want peace. But people whofought for eight years know the value of peace.&quot; Thus, hesaid, it is only &quot;natural such people reject expansionism,reject hegemony and reject capitulation.&quot;   Both Jordan and Iraq seem genuinely to feel vulnerablenow, though for somewhat different reasons. Jordan, whichheld free elections this year, now faces a parliament whereone third of the seats are held by fundamentalists, some ofwhom profess to see war as the only way to deal with Israel.So, Jordan is under internal pressure to stand tough againstIsrael. At the same time, officials fear external aggressionfrom Israel. Trapped between these two pressures, theJordanian monarchy appears to fear for its existence. A badeconomy has made discontent even worse.   For its part, Iraq's president and other officials appearto have convinced themselves the world is conspiring againstthem. British and U.S. diplomats are combing the Gulf nationswarning rulers to fear Iraq, the president claimed. (TheState Department denied the claim.) He declined to saywhether the shipment of 132-foot long pipe seized by Britishand American customs agents was indeed intended for creationof an Iraqi &quot;big gun.&quot; If so, he said, the gun wouldn't haveas long a range as missiles already in Israel's possessionand, he argued, Iraq has the right to weapons equal to thosein Israel's arsenal. So, why not disclose plans for the gunif they exist? &quot;I leave it to your speculation,&quot; he said.   He was similarly coy about any Iraqi nuclear weaponsprogram. Referring to the French nuclear reactor Israeli jetsdestroyed in 198l, he said, &quot;It has neither been our programnor is it now our program to use these reactors for militarypurposes.&quot; Asked if he feels chemical weapons are asufficient deterrent, he said &quot;yes&quot; but added with a raresmile, &quot;If the U.S. were to lend us nuclear weapons with theobjective of balancing those Israel was given we shall notdecline them.&quot;   In his one philosophical moment, the president concededArabs made a mistake in 1967 by not accepting Israel's offerof land for peace. Then, the Arabs believed they could takeback the land without granting peace. Now the Arabs offerpeace for land -- a home for Palestinians on the West Bank --and Israel seems little interested. Asked about this irony,he said, &quot;The Arabs have made their mistakes.&quot;   On other issues, President Hussein said Iraq is engaged ina &quot;direct dialogue&quot; with Iran aimed at transforming thepresent cease fire between the two countries into a permanentpeace. He also said he intends to hold a referendum laterthis year on both a new constitution and his own leadership.&quot;If counting votes is the only means for you {the U.S.} togauge the popularity of a leader, then you will have figuresthis year,&quot; he said.   The president was also characteristically defiant aboutIraq's execution in March of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-bornBritish journalist accused of espionage. The U.S. and Britain&quot;began to talk about ruthless Saddam with no heart when a spyis executed to avoid a return to the time when foreigners ranrampant in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not allow anyforeigner to steal intelligence.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
