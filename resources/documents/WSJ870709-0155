Yet it is surely one of the most undermarketed products in America. While consumers spend $15 billion a year to carpet their homes, textile-fiber companies normally invest only about $5 million for consumer advertising, and the ads tend to be, well, run of the mill.    Dick Prinstein, merchandising and advertising director for Allied-Signal Inc.'s fiber business, puts it more bluntly: &quot;When carpet advertising comes on TV, it's so boring that people turn their brains off.&quot;    But this year in a major turnabout, he fiber industry believes it has something worth crowing about and is putting far more money and creative effort into peddling carpet than ever before. Allied-Signal, Du Pont Co. and Monsanto Co. will easily spend more than $50 million on splashy ads touting their new stain-resistant carpet technologies. Top-spending Du Pont claims that by the end of 1987, it will have made 8.7 billion impressions with its Stainmaster carpet advertising. That's enough exposure, in other words, for every adult in the U.S. to see a Stainmaster ad 53 times.    &quot;The fiber industry finally has a significant new benefit to sell, and it is one that has special appeal to working women,&quot; says C. William Taylor, marketing director for Monsanto's fibers division. &quot;The advertising is intended to make consumers curious enough about the stain-blocking technology to get them into stores. What we really need to do is shorten the carpet-replacement cycle, which unfortunately has increased from seven years to 11 years for the average homeowner.&quot;    BUT THE AD BLITZ could mislead consumers into expecting miracles. While the new carpeting is more resistant to such stains as motor oil, soft drinks and ketchup, it isn't perfect.    &quot;There's a real danger of overselling,&quot; Mr. Taylor says. &quot;From watching some of the TV ads, you would think these new carpets are bullet-proof. But some stains, such as bleach and acne medicine, will still be bad actors.&quot;    Each company naturally claims its easy-to-clean carpet brand is superior, either because of the type of nylon polymers or the method for applying the stain-repelling chemicals. Such technical differences, however, would be lost on most consumers. Which is why the fiber makers are trying so hard to build brand-name recognition through entertaining commercials.    Thus far, Du Pont has the creative edge. Its commercials were rated among the 10 most popular ad campaigns on TV during the first half of 1987, according to Video Storyboard Tests Inc., a research firm. This marks the first time carpet ads have ever won consumers' praise in the 10 years Video Storyboard has conducted its popularity poll. The Du Pont spot that people like most features an impish, red-haired boy sitting in a highchair and playing with his dinner. When an announcer says, &quot;You are cleared for takeoff,&quot; the child sends his airplane-shaped dish of food flying into the air.    &quot;Sean Kiley (the boy in the ad) appeals to our primary target -- women 25 to 54 years old who make most carpet buying decisions,&quot; says Gary Johnston, advertising supervisor for carpet fibers. &quot;I've received many letters from women who say they remember a child pulling a stunt like that.&quot; There were also a few letters criticizing the ad for encouraging kids to be devilish at dinnertime.    TAKING a much different tack, Allied's advertising combines a celebrity endorser with special effects. In the commercial for the Anso V Worry-Free brand, comedian Don Rickles literally becomes the carpet, and the king of insults gets abused for a change. People spill chocolate ice cream and red wine next to his face, which appears to be woven into the carpet. &quot;We believe it's the first time in advertising history that a celebrity has become the product itself,&quot; says Harvey Kahn, executive vice president of Rumrill-Hoyt, the agency that created the Allied ad.    Monsanto, meanwhile, has taken the heartwarming, Norman Rockwell approach in its commercial, which shows a little boy named Jeff and his faithful cocker spaniel Spot. Unlike its competitors, Monsanto is running the ad only on cable TV and skipping the more expensive broadcast TV channels. It has scheduled about 45 cable spots a week, supplemented by heavy magazine and radio advertising. The company also is trying to drum up publicity for its StainBlocker carpet by sending California's Carpet Cleaner of the Year around the country to speak to the media.    IT'S TOO EARLY to measure the impact of the marketing barrage. But Du Pont says its Stainmaster has been selling &quot;like gangbusters&quot; and that for the first time consumers are asking retailers for specific fiber brands and are not shopping for color and style alone. &quot;We and BBDO, our advertising agency, were flabbergasted that we got consumer response so quickly,&quot; says Bruce Koepcke, a Du Pont marketing manager. &quot;I believe it's because there hadn't been any carpet advertising to speak of before.&quot;    Regardless of how much carpet Du Pont's advertising ends up selling, it definitely has sparked interest in another product. The company has been swamped with letters from people who want to know where they can buy the airplane-shaped dish the little boy throws into the air in the commercial. The plastic dish was one of a kind, custom-designed for the ad. But sensing a promotional opportunity, Du Pont contracted with another manufacturer to mass produce the airplane dish. So far, more than 20,000 dishes have either been sold or given away free with carpet purchases. </TEXT></DOC>
