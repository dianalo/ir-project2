(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush today predictedvictory in the New Hampshire primary and said rival Bob Dole hasfallen into the same ``momentum'' trap that snared Bush after the1980 Iowa caucuses. Democrat Paul Simon told his supporters to lookfor ``a real surprise'' in the nation's first primary.   ``I want New Hampshire to do what it did in 1980'' whenPresident Reagan turned around an Iowa defeat and beat Bush in theNew Hampshire primary, Bush said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''   In 1980, ``I came into New Hampshire talking momentum. Reagangot the issues out. And now it's the opposite _ Bob Dole is talkingmomentum and I'm talking issues ... We're doing better getting outthose differences with Bob Dole on the issues.''   On the eve of the nation's first primary, the Galluporganization released a poll showing Dole leading Bush in NewHampshire by a 36-28 margin, with Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson tiedfor third at 12 percent and Pete du Pont fifth with seven percent.The poll of 589 likely Republican voters was conducted Friday andSaturday and had a five-point margin of error.   Other polls also showed the race a virtual tie, with the vicepresident's once substantial lead vanished into New Hampshire'sfrigid air and the trend moving in the Kansas senator's direction.   On the Democratic side, Michael Dukakis remained the leader andthe target of sniping by Richard Gephardt and Simon, who are stilldueling for second. The Gallup poll of 424 Democrats showed Dukakiswith 39 percent, Gephardt 18 percent and Simon 16 percent. Itsmargin of error was four points.   Simon, campaigning in Hollis, N.H., claimed the race ``isbetween Michael Dukakis and me'' and ``I think it is tightening. Ithink there is a possibility of a real surprise coming tomorrow.''   Simon began television commercials attacking Dukakis, thegovernor of next-door Massachusetts, as a bureaucrat. Gephardt'snew ads lashed at Dukakis too, calling him ``one of the biggesttax-raisers in Massachusetts history.''   Dukakis ignored the criticism, devoting much of Sunday tostating his views on foreign policy issues including CentralAmerica and nuclear arms control. He emphasized his opposition tofunding for the Nicaraguan Contras, but said he would use militaryforce, if necessary, to thwart a military attack on a CentralAmerican ally.   Bush cast himself as President Reagan's strong loyalist in adebate with his five rivals Sunday night, while Pat Robertsonoffered the startling assertion that the Soviet Union secretly hasplaced nuclear missiles in Cuba _ ``nukes pointing at the UnitedStates,'' he said.   A White House official promptly disputed Robertson's claim, anda Robertson aide said after the debate that the candidate had meantmissile-delivery systems, not necessarily warheads.   Dole displayed the confidence of a candidate who has seen allthe breaks go his way for the past week since trouncing the vicepresident in the Iowa caucuses.   ``Some of us would like to see it end Tuesday here with someonewinning,'' Dole said. He gently boasted later, ``I have come a longway in the last 30 days.''   Mindful that a secon loss after his Iowa debacle would bedevastating, Bush acknowledged his own shortcomings as a campaignerand made clear he didn't intend to give up, no matter the outcomeTuesday.   He insisted he has no ``lack of passion'' and declared, ``Mywork isn't done yet.''   For Robertson, the former television preacher, the missilesremark was one of a series of attention-getting statements over thepast several days that provoked Jack Kemp to say in the debate,``He has said some off-the-wall things.''   Robertson said in separate television interviews Sunday that he``wouldn't have hesitated to kill'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,and that he wants to gradually abolish the Social Security system``over 40 years, moving it into a private system.''   Robertson failed to show up at a candidate's forum held at aJewish temple in Manchester where he had been scheduled to speakjust after the debate. His state campaign director, David D.Randlett, told leaders of the Temple Adath Yeshurun that he didn'tknow why Robertson never showed up. After hurried telephone callsRandlett said he couldn't find anyone with Robertson who could tellhim.   Some 150 people had waited for an hour at the same temple where,four years ago in an emotion-packed session, Jesse Jackson tried toexplain his embarrassing reference to New York as ``Hymietown.''   Democratic darkhorse Bruce Babbitt, arriving as scheduled,ridiculed Robertson.   ``They told me he was too busy turning the next storm out tosea,'' Babbitt said, provoking laughter. After talking for an hour,Babbitt said, ``I'm willing to stay here till the sunrise _ whetherit comes at the usual time or Pat Robertson makes it a littleearlier.''   Robertson, the surprise second-place finisher in Iowa, was in astruggle with Kemp for third place in most New Hampshire polls. Hiscampaign manager Mark Nuttle said after the debate that Robertsonhad meant to say missile delivery systems _ not warheads _ were inCuba. He wouldn't give the source of his information other thanthat some of it had been ``compiled'' by the Senate ForeignRelations Committee.   Outside the debate at St. Anselm College, about 25 ``Youth forRobertson'' students jeered at about 70 members of ``Cure AIDSNow,'' a group that includes AIDS victims. The Robertson backerschanted, ``It's your own fault.''   Republicans Kemp and Pete du Pont, and Democrats Babbitt andGary Hart all faced the prospect of having little choice but todrop out if they fall short Tuesday _ although du Pont and Hartvowed to go on in any event. Third place seemed to be the line thatdetermined the future for Kemp and du Pont.   In the GOP debate, Kemp and du Pont both attacked Dole asharboring a secret desire to raise taxes. Du Pont thrust a piece ofpaper in Dole's face and asked him to sign a no-tax-increase pledgewhile accusing him of pushing through higher taxes in the Senate.   ``That was to close loopholes on big companies like DuPont,''Dole said in sharp reply, a reference to the giant corporation thatwas begun by du Pont's ancestors and is the source of his wealth.   The Democratic candidates held their final debate of the NewHampshire campaign on Saturday night, with Gephardt drawingcriticism from his rivals for changing positions on taxes and arange of other issues.   Albert Gore Jr. asked for and got a televised apology fromGephardt for a profane denunciation of himself and his staff madeby Gephardt campaign manager Bill Carrick earlier in the week.   Jesse Jackson boarded a 1930s train for a whistle-stop tourthrough the Lakes Region of the state and drew hundreds at eachstop despite 20-degree temperatures and gusty winds.   ``I've stood with you. On Tuesday I want you to stand with me,''Jackson said from aboard his ``Rainbow Express.''</TEXT></DOC>
