The program focused on two kinds of experiments: (a) the measurementof neutron and gamma-ray spectra resulting when 14-MeV neutrons incidenton bulk shields of different composition and thickness, and (b) the measurementof neutron and gamma-ray spectra as a function of detector location relativeto the mouths of straight cylindrical ducts of different length-to-diameterratios when 14-MeV neutrons were incident on the ducts.</TEXT></DOC>
