RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GTE UTEARNINGS (ERN)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   GTE Corp. posted fourth-quarter earnings of $268.2 million after a year-earlier loss, but said profit was depressed by its long-distance telephone business.    Meanwhile, United Telecommunications Inc., said it earned $28.3 million, or 28 cents a share, in its fourth quarter, compared with a loss a year earlier of $141.1 million.    Both GTE and United Telecommunications' quarterly performances were hurt by results at US Sprint Communications Co., their 50-50 long-distance joint venture. GTE said losses at US Sprint are expected to persist at least through 1987.    GTE said the impact of US Sprint's losses were more than offset by earnings at GTE's local telephone business and other operations. United Telecommunications said a solid performance by its telephone operations softened the effect of losses incurred by US Sprint as it expanded its share of the long-distance market.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, GTE, Stamford, Conn., posted a loss of $1.01 billion that included a $1.3 billion restructuring charge. Profit in the latest quarter would be equal to 79 cents a share, accounting for a 3-for-2 stock split to begin being paid Feb. 12. Quarterly revenue rose 2.3% to $3.99 billion from $3.9 billion.    United Telecommunications' year-earlier loss of $141.1 million was after a $175 million charge related to the formation of US Sprint. The Kansas City, Mo.-based company's latest fourth quarter includes $781,000 from discontinued operations, compared with $23,000 a year earlier. Revenue fell 7% to $738 million from $790.5 million.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, GTE closed at $62.50 a share, down 12.5 cents, while United Telecommunications closed at $27.50, down 37.5 cents.    The US Sprint long-distance venture had a pre-tax loss of $199.2 million in the quarter of which GTE absorbed half, or $99.1 million before tax effects. In the year-earlier quarter, before GTE and United Telecommunications combined their long-distance operations, US Sprint had a pre-tax loss of $56.9 million.    Analysts estimated that US Sprint's total pre-tax loss for 1987 would be $500 million to $600 million, much wider than expected only a few weeks ago. Analysts said US Sprint's strategy is to sacrifice profit in the short term to gain customers, an approach that some view favorably.    Because US Sprint is rapidly attracting new customers, it is running out of capacity on its network, forcing it to resort to expensive leasing of lines from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., analysts said. The development has become evident only in recent weeks, analysts said, adding that the additional cost explains why they are widening their estimates of US Sprint's loss for 1987.    US Sprint &quot;will add customers, and it will cost,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. &quot;But I think it is a smart strategy.&quot; He continued: &quot;There is leverage for the company once it gets its network built. A lot of the cost will go away. The losses will be justified if they have a good set of customers going into 1988.&quot;    A GTE spokesman said he wouldn't comment on the analysts' estimates of US Sprint's pre-tax losses. But he said the analysts are correct about the increase in customers and the related need to lease lines. The long-distance carrier gained one million customers in each of the third and fourth quarters, he said. &quot;That forced us to use a variety of other (telephone) networks,&quot; he said, adding that construction of its own network will be completed this year, and the company will start transferring over its customers. &quot;The cost will begin to diminish then,&quot; he said.    US Sprint's fourth-quarter revenue rose more than 30% to $589 million, compared with the combined revenue of GTE and United Telecommunications' long-distance operations, which were separate in the year-earlier fourth quarter, GTE said. United Telecommunications said US Sprint had revenue of $1.14 billion in its first six months of operations.    &quot;Despite the substantial losses incurred at US Sprint, we remain convinced that this company will become a successful competitor in the long-distance market,&quot; said Theodore F. Brophy, GTE's chairman and chief executive officer.    United Telecommunications said that after the major transfer to US Sprint's fiber-optic network begins in the first half of 1987, network costs will be reduced significantly. The company said construction of the 23,000-mile fiber-optic network was on schedule in 1986.    GTE's latest fourth-quarter results were reduced by $14 million, reflecting primarily the retroactive repeal of the investment tax credits under the new tax law. Excluding this and the one-time restructuring charges, earnings in the latest fourth quarter would have been $283 million, or 83 cents a share, compared with $283 million, or 86 a share, GTE said.    For all of 1986, GTE had net income of $1.18 billion, or $3.53 a share, taking into account the 3-for-2 split, compared with 1985's net loss of $161.1 million reflecting the restructuring charges. Revenue rose 5% to $15.11 billion from $14.37 billion.    For the year, United Telecommunications earned $180.6 million, or $1.81 a share, including a loss from discontinued operations of $6.7 million, compared with net income of $20.8 million, or 18 cents a share, after the charge, including a $5.6 million loss from discontinued operations. Revenue fell 2% to $3.06 billion from $3.13 billion.    (Revised WSJ Feb. 12, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
