Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit have elected to accept early-retirement incentives and leave the company by year's end.    The unit offered the early-retirement programs last month to 2,800 hourly workers as part of a plan to increase operating efficiencies and to strengthen its competitive position.    The unit of the food and tobacco concern said it is continuing a previously announced study to see if additional staff reductions are needed. No further reductions of hourly workers are expected, it said. At the end of 1986, RJR employed 124,617 workers world-wide. </TEXT></DOC>
