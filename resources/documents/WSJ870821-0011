The proposed offering, at an expected price of $15 to $18 a share, confirms speculation that Mr. Lorenzo would use the private company in a new round of corporate deal-making. Jet Capital said the proceeds, which could total about $43 million, would be used not only to further increase its airline-industry holdings but to acquire majority interests in companies outside the airline business.    The offering will be made late next month by an underwriting group managed by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. and Kidder Peabody andamp; Co.    Jet Capital also announced an 11-for-1 split of its closely held 410,800 common shares, which aren't publicly traded. The split allows Mr. Lorenzo and his associates to maintain control of Jet Capital while being able to issue shares at a reasonable price. Mr. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air and president of its Continental Airlines Inc. unit, currently owns 51% of the general voting power of New York-based Jet Capital. About one-quarter of Jet Capital's shares are held by nine associates of Mr. Lorenzo, while the rest are held by fewer than 100 investors.    As previously reported, shareholders at Texas Air's annual meeting this year approved a measure to increase Jet Capital's voting control of Texas Air to 34.1% from 21% through a special class of Texas Air stock held entirely by Jet Capital. The same stock also gives Jet Capital the power to elect three-quarters of Texas Air's board.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texas Air closed at $35.75, up 75 cents.    Jet Capital is the cornerstone of Mr. Lorenzo's airline empire. In 1969 he and a partner, Robert Carney, raised $1 million through a Jet Capital stock offering, and in 1972 acquired then-failing Texas International Airlines, which later purchased Continental. Last year, Texas Air acquired Eastern Airlines, People Express and Frontier Airlines. Mr. Carney sold his one-third interest in Jet Capital last year for $11 million.    Until this year, Jet Capital was a quiet holding company, run from Mr. Lorenzo's desk. The company held Texas Air securities and cooperated in Texas Air's purchases of stock in other airlines. But in February, Jet Capital hired a new president -- its first employee -- Kevin S. Moore, who in 1985 participated in the $1.4 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Industries Inc.    Earlier this summer, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a request from Jet Capital to allow it to diversify beyond airline holdings without being subject to the administrative burdens placed on concerns that the SEC classifies as investment companies. </TEXT></DOC>
