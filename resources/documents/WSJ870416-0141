The utility says it wants to retire all $85 million of the 15% bonds to reduce its debt costs. It said that at the close of business Tuesday, the previously scheduled expiration date, only about $2 million of the bonds had been tendered.    &quot;We possibly will be coming out with a new offer, depending on what happens in the market,&quot; Jeffrey Gorham, the company's director of corporate financing, said.    Consumers Power said it has $56 million in cash available to redeem at par any of the 15% bonds not tendered and accepted in the exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
