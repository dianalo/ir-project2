The commonindex problem is used to return the best available record in thefile according to the terms of a class of user preferences.andP;  Thedecision maker's preferences and values can be incorporated whenthe decision-theoretic approach is used.andP;  This approach integratesthe decision problem with the data base system by viewing thealgorithm used for the retrieval process as a formalization ofpart of the decision strategy used by the decision maker.andP;  Thedecision-theoretic approach permits the algorithm to include theuser's priorities.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Information Storage and RetrievalAlgorithmsDecision MakingSearch Strategy.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Typical investor's indifference curves.
