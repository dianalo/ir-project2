If Iraq allows what one official calls completely&quot;unfettered&quot; flights by U.N. inspection helicopters when theyattempt to fly, which they may do as early as today, thereprobably won't be U.S. military action, officials say.</LP><TEXT>   But administration aides also said that after six monthsof annoyance at Iraq's level of cooperation with U.N.inspectors they are giving Baghdad a small margin for error.Even slight interference with the flights will trigger a U.S.response.   U.S. officials refused to say precisely what that responsewould be, or exactly what military equipment would be inSaudi Arabia to back up U.S. threats. But if Mr. Bush optsfor a military response, Pentagon officials say they plan tosend immediately more than 100 jets and heavily armedhelicopters to Saudi Arabia, as well as tankers, surveillanceplanes, intelligence analysts and at least 3,000 groundsupport personnel.   It's likely that the first reaction would be for U.S.helicopters and warplanes to give armed escorts to the U.N.helicopters over Iraqi territory. If Iraq challenged theescorts, there could be a U.S. attack, probably focusing onthe sites where the U.S. suspects chemical and nuclearweapons materials are being hidden.   President Bush is likely to explain the U.S. positiontoday, when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly. Theinternational inspections of Iraqi military facilities,designed to ensure that Iraq is disclosing and destroying itsweapons of mass destruction, are being carried out under theterms of two U.N. Security Council resolutions that broughtan end to the war to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.   If there is an order for military action, it might not becarried out immediately. Pentagon officials say that unitssent from Europe would arrive in Saudi Arabia in less than 12hours. But many U.S.-based units would need two or three daysto pack up for the long trip, fly to the Middle East and thenprepare crews and equipment to carry out combat missions.Some Air Force units currently in Turkey or other Middle Eastcountries also are included in the contingency plans, onePentagon planner said.   The U.S. already has about 200 jets in the region, butmany of them are based on Navy carriers and would have to flylong distances to reach potential Iraqi targets. The largesize of the proposed U.S. force, according to Pentagonofficials, reflects the conclusion of military leaders thatremnants of the Iraq air force still could pose some sort ofa military threat and that Saddam Hussein probably continuesto control dozens of operational Scud missiles.   In addition, Air Force generals have expressed concernthat Saddam Hussein's forces may have managed to patch upsome air-defense units and therefore could fire missiles atU.S. planes or choppers backing up the inspection teams. As aresult, specially equipped radar-jamming planes andground-attack versions of high-performance jets are among theplanes on alert for possible use over Iraq.   The overall size of any U.S. armed force sent to SaudiArabia also depends on how much of a military role France,Britain and other allies are willing to assume. Theadministration is trying to reach agreement with those alliesabout whether they will continue to participate in aninternational force now operating in northern Iraq withorders to protect and provide humanitarian relief for Kurdishrefugees.   Some Pentagon analysts estimate that as much as 80% ofIraq's nuclear and chemical weapons-making facilities weredestroyed or severely damaged during the war. But withoutcomplete inspections, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and othermilitary leaders fear, Iraq could hide the remains of thoseprograms from the U.N. teams and begin secretly rebuildingthem within a matter of months. On Friday, the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency, an arm of the U.N., condemned Iraq fornoncompliance with U.N. safeguards against proliferation ofnuclear weapons.   Yesterday, Reuters reported that a 45-member U.N.inspection team arrived to search for nuclear weapons-makingfacilities. A separate biological-weapons team began lookingat sites during the weekend, and the Associated Press quoteda spokesman as saying he talked with the team by radio and&quot;everything was fine.&quot;   If Saddam Hussein allows the latest round of inspectors tomove around at will, it still will require several months andmany more such visits to locate and analyze all suspectplants and research facilities. Some Pentagon officials areconvinced that only beefed up U.S. military power in theregion will force Saddam Hussein to destroy the remnants ofhis arsenal of mass destruction.   If an attack were ordered, Air Force crews are expected touse extra-large bombs to try to open up underground,concrete-reinforced weapons sites and then usehigh-temperature armaments to destroy biological ornuclear-production equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
