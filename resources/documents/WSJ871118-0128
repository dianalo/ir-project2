But the minister, who has been steadfastly opposed to bold fiscal steps to bolster economic growth, gave no indication that he is prepared to endorse calls for such sweeping measures as an acceleration or enlargement of scheduled tax cuts.    Mr. Stoltenberg, returning from a European Community finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, said Germany was considering fiscal and monetary means for strengthening growth. However, he said the &quot;degree&quot; of stimulation must be carefully weighed. Specifically, Mr. Stoltenberg ruled out the possibility of new government spending to spur the German economy and said the tax-reform package as planned was &quot;the best we can do.&quot;    The remarks, while noncommittal, were a departure from his long-standing position that Bonn has done all it can to bolster the German economy. Indeed, Mr. Stoltenberg in recent days has shown more willingness to rethink his conservative economic policies in the face of intense pressure both at home and abroad. A staunch supporter of balanced budgets, the finance minister nonetheless told his EC colleagues Monday that he would be willing to tolerate higher budget deficits, if necessary, as a way to support growth.    &quot;I don't think {Mr. Stoltenberg} has changed his basic views,&quot; said one senior Western diplomat in Bonn. But, he added, Mr. Stoltenberg is looking &quot;at the minimum he can come up with&quot; to deflect growing criticism of Germany's economic policies. A denunciation of those policies Monday by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher &quot;is troubling them,&quot; the official asserted. &quot;They don't want to be isolated.&quot;    At a meeting in Paris yesterday, the Economic Policy Committee of the 24-nation Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development kept up the pressure on Germany. A statement issued on behalf of the committee by Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, said that &quot;a majority of the committee thought that additional fiscal measures in Germany to support demand would be desirable.&quot;    As for monetary policy, the German central bank recently has shown a willingness to lower interest rates to fight the fall of the dollar. One official at the Bundesbank said &quot;chances are quite good&quot; that the central bank's board, at its meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow, will again lower the repurchase-agreement rate, at which the central bank offers short-term borrowings to banks. The rate at the most-recent offering of repurchase agreements, last week, was cut to 3.5% from 3.8% and the official said a further lowering, by as much as one-quarter percentage point, was possible.    However, he and other market professionals doubt that the Bundesbank will lower its discount rate before an expected meeting of the seven leading industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven. They note, moreover, that the central bank has been pressing Bonn to ease its burden by doing more in the realm of fiscal policy and may hold off on a discount-rate cut until it receives clearer assurances of such action.    The central bank's governing board meets every other week, and the official noted that tomorrow's meeting may be the last opportunity to send a cooperative signal to Washington before an expected compromise between the Reagan administration and Congress to lower the U.S. budget deficit. Once that compromise is reached, it is expected that a meeting of the Group of Seven will follow.    German policy makers are heartened by White House assurances of an $80 billion deficit-reduction package, and U.S. officials in Bonn say they believe Germany understands its responsibility to take up some of the economic slack if the U.S. goes ahead with its moves.    German officials have been awaiting congressional endorsement of White House budget declarations before making specific pledges about expanding the economy. However, senior government officials have provided a glimpse of what may be in store.    Bernhard Molitor, head of the economic policy department at the German Economics Ministry, said Monday that the government would allow the deficit to rise above the planned level of slightly less than 30 billion West German marks ($17.54 billion) next year if tax revenue declines as a result of slowed economic growth and reduced receipts from Bundesbank profits.    However, there are increasing calls, especially from the Social Democrats, for a growth of the deficit well beyond this modest concession. Those making such calls want accelerated government spending for such projects as public works, environmental protection and job-creation programs. This position is winning support even among conservatives who think an expansion of the domestic market, through higher government deficit spending, is the way to jog the sluggish economy, even at the risk of higher inflation.    Mr. Stoltenberg and his advisers prefer deregulation in such areas as telecommunications and the labor market, where wages are currently set at mandatory minimum levels. The finance minister said at yesterday's press briefing that these options for stimulation were wiser than &quot;risky expansion programs.&quot;    Germany's final position will depend on several as yet undecided factors: U.S. action on its budget deficit, the rate of the dollar against the mark and the overall state of the German economy. Industry officials say continued gains by the mark against the dollar, which hurt the country's export-oriented industry, could spark even stronger calls for stimulus from the business community.    German businessmen and bankers who once dismissed calls for Germany to stimulate its economy, have begun to press the government for expansive steps out of fear that the country faces a possible recession if internationally coordinated economic steps aren't implemented.    Calls to restore exchange-rate and trade stability have focused on the possibility of bringing forward the government's planned 39 billion-mark ($22.8 billion) tax-reduction package, scheduled for 1990. But some parliamentarians concede that such a step would face a difficult test if put before the legislature, which already has resisted elements of the original tax bill. </TEXT></DOC>
