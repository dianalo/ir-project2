In the press of other priorities,some cost-effective energy conservation practices receive less supportnow than during the days of sharply rising fuel costs. Such things asenergy audits, site energy system studies, and upgrading technology maybe deferred because of lack of management focus or the misconceptionthat there is no longer an &quot;energy problem.&quot; In spite of stable fuelprices, energy costs are still a very important factor in the competitivenessof many process plants. Changes in the relative costs of the mix of energytypes used in a typical process plant and the application of newer technologycontinue to provide opportunities for profit. This article discussessome ways to raise the profile of energy efficiency improvement programsand to establish strategies that promise progress even under the currentcircumstances.</TEXT></DOC>
