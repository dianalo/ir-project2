ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., its image one ofconfidence and strength, stormed to the top of the takeover businessby accomplishing billion-dollar leveraged buyouts, including thebiggest corporate acquisition of all time.   But a lawsuit filed Tuesday by Jerome Kohlberg Jr., one of thefirm's founders, shows the dissension among the ranks of KohlbergKravis partners and adds to the firm's growing problems four monthsafter it completed its record $24.53 billion buyout of RJR NabiscoInc.   In the suit filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Kohlbergalleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies that wereacquired while he was one of KKR's general partners. Kohlberg claimsthat violated an agreement he made with the firm when he left itsmanagement in 1987.   The suit names as defendants Kohlberg Kravis, its KKR Associatesarm and the firm's two other founders, Henry R. Kravis and George R.Roberts.   Kohlberg alleged the defendants ``determined to secure andtransfer ...a portion of Kohlberg's interests with respect to thesecompanies to themselves or other KKR personnel and-or persons orentities which they chose.''   The firm denied Kohlberg's allegations in a statement:   ``We are saddened that Mr. Kohlberg felt it necessary to sue hispartners and KKR. We belive he is wrong, both as to the facts andhis interpretation of the agreement between us and we fully expectto prevail in court.''   The suit comes as Kohlberg Kravis, a superstar in mergers andacquisitions and the leader among leveraged buyout firms, has runinto difficulties with some of its properties.   Leveraged buyouts are deals financed mainly with borrowed moneythat is repaid with the acquired company's cash flow or the sale ofits assets.   The firm, whose operations long have been a mystery to thepublic, reportedly has had trouble selling some of its businessesand several others either are foundering or have been disappointinginvestments.   For example, New York-based Seaman's Furniture Co., which wentprivate in a $360 million Kohlberg Kravis-engineered LBO two yearsago, has said it must renegotiate debt payments, partly becausesales growth has not met expectations.   Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts formed their partnership in 1976,with each of the three serving as general partners who managed thefirm and directed its acquisitions and investments.   Kohlberg remained a general partner until 1987, when after afalling-out with Kravis and Roberts over the firm's strategy hebecame a limited partner, sharing in Kohlberg Kravis' profits butnot in its management.   Among the deals undertaken while Kohlberg was a general partnerwere the 1986 LBOs of consumer products giant Beatrice Cos. for $6.1billion and the grocery chain Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion.   Kohlberg claims that under his 1987 agreement with the firm hewas supposed to maintain his previously allocated stakes incompanies that KKR acquired while he was still a general partner. Inseveral cases, his interest has been reduced, his suit alleged.   The suit involves Kohlberg's investment in several KohlbergKravis properties:   _Marley Co., acquired in a 1981 LBO. The company manufacturesheat exchange and fluid handling equipment such as boilers andcooling towers.   _Houdaille Industries Inc., an industrial products manufacturer,acquired in a 1979 LBO.   _Idex Corp., formed last year as a holding company for sixHoudaille subsidiaries.   _Pacific Realty Associates, a real estate investment partnershipacquired in a 1983 LBO.   _Mandamp;T Inc., acquired in a 1985 LBO, another real estate concern.   _PacTrust Realty Inc., formed in 1988 as a holding company forMandamp;T and Pacific Realty.   For example, the complaint said, Kohlberg Kravis decided in June1988 to recapitalize Marley through the redemption of debt and thepurchase of equity interests in Marley of limited partners and otherinvestors.   The recapitalization was accomplished through loans fromfinancial institutions and the investment of additional capital byKohlberg Kravis partners and other investors, the complaint read.   ``In this connection, KKR has informed Kohlberg that his interestin KKR's investment in the Marley leveraged buyout transaction madein 1981 would be reduced from 32 percent to 17.625 percent, or byalmost one-half'' in violation of the 1987 agreement, the complaintsaid.   The complaintdemanded that Kohlberg Kravis restore to Kohlbergthe interest in the companies as provided for in the 1987 agreementand that the court prohibit the defendants from reducing Kohlberg'sstake in other companies in violation of the agreement.   KKR's other general partners, Robert MacDonnell, Paul Raether andMichael Michelson, were not named as defendants in the suit.   Kohlberg Kravis' limited partners include its investors, amongthem corporate and state pension funds. These investors _ who alsowere not named in Kohlberg's suit _ help supply the equity forbuyouts undertaken by the firm.</TEXT></DOC>
