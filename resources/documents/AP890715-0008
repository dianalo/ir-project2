Arthur Abba Goldberg entered the plea before U.S. District JudgeJesse Curtis, said Guam's U.S. Attorney, Bill O'Connor. In exchangefor his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wireand mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statuteswere dismissed.   ``In dismissing the counts, the Guam issues were dissolved,''O'Connor said. ``Other issues are on the table if anotherjurisdiction sees fit to follow through.''   Twelve of the counts were related directly to Guam, a U.S.territory since August, 1950, said O'Connor. The balance of thecounts related to fraud involving use of the Commercial Bank ofAmericas in transactions that did not involve Guam, O'Connor said.   Although Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bondunderwriting firm of Matthews andamp; Wright, only pleaded to three of thedozen counts, O'Connor was satisfied with the outcome.   ``Mr. Goldberg's plea gave the same latitude of sentencing thanif he went to trial,'' O'Connor said. ``We, of course, willrecommend jail time and a heavy fine.''   Goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a $750,000 fineand restitution payments, O'Connor said in a telephone interviewfrom his Santa Ana office. Sentencing was scheduled in Curtis' courtSept. 11.   One of Goldberg's attorneys, Howard L. Weitzman, said he had noimmediate comment. A receptionist who answered a call made afterbusiness hours to another defense attorney, Bruce Hochman, saidHochman had gone for the day.   The three mail fraud counts concerned $57,500 bilked from theGuam Program Development Fund and a letter assuring fund authoritiesthat transactions were above board, while fraud was taking place.   Goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bankentrusted with fund money. ``The bank paid the money Goldbergexerted for his purposes and ... he attempted to cover up later withfalse papers in the files,'' O'Connor said.   O'Connor said $25,000 was ``used to buy campaign paraphernalia _parasols, hats, shirts, junk like that'' for Guam Gov. Ricardo J.Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election bid.   The funds were funneled to Bordallo after he was promised themoney in exchange for his support on a bond issue, $300 million ofwhich was sold by Matthews andamp; Wright.   The bond was approved by the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews andamp;Wright deny any wrongdoing.   Bordallo was acquitted in February, 1986, of accepting bribesfrom Goldberg but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.   The case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwideinvolving Matthews andamp; Wright under investigation by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
