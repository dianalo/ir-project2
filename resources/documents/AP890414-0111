Sudanese soldiers were moved to the border with Chad and weredisarming Chadian troopers who had crossed the border, a Sudaneseofficial said.   Chad's government identified the plotters as Hassan Djamous,commander-in-chief of the armed forces; Idriss Debi, hispredecessor in the post; and Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat Itno.   The government, in a communique released Thursday night throughthe Chadian Embassy in Paris, said the coup leaders ``entered intorebellion against the institutions of the republic'' on the nightof April 1-2.   The communique said the armed forces were ``ordered to destroy''the plotters and ``put an end to the rebellion by annihilation.''   It described the coup leaders as ``individuals motivated andmanipulated by overwhelming ambition.''   Asked about the fate of the ringleaders, the Chadian Embassyonly would say the plot had been uncovered and its authors andaccomplices rendered harmless.   Diplomatic sources in N'Djamena, capital of the northern Africannation, said April 5 that Itno was arrested and that Djamous andDebi had disappeared.   The sources also said military movements occurred in the capitalthe weekend of April 1-3 and that people trying to get in or out ofthe city were stopped at roadblocks.   In a report from N'Djamena, the French news agency AgenceFrance-Presse quoted unidentified sources as saying Djamous andDebi were wounded Tuesday in fighting with troops who had pursuedthem across the border into Sudan's Darfur province. It saidDjamous was taken prisoner but Debi escaped. In a statementreleased Thursday night in Khartoum, the governor of the province,Tigani Sysi said the Itno, Djamous and Debi crossed into Sudan aweek ago.   The Sudanese armed forces General Command issued a statementsaying Chadian soldiers had intruded into Darfur and that Sudanesesoldiers were sent there for security and to expel the Chadians.   The statement gave no number for the Chadian intruders, but amagazine, Al-Adwaa, said 2,000 Chadian soldiers crossed overfollowing the coup attempt.   The Sudanese governor confirmed the presence of Chadian forcesin his region, but said Sudanese troopers were disarming theChadian soldiers.   Itno took a leading role in negotiations which led to the Habregovernment's reconciliation with numerous political oppponents whohad been engaged in a drawn out civil war with the government.   Itno also joined in negotations that led to the 1987 pact withrebel leader Acheik Ibn Omar, who was appointed foreign ministerearlier this year.   Habre has ruled Chad since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backedgovernment led by Goukouni Oueddei.   Libya maintained troops in northern Chad and supported Chadianfactions opposed to Habre until 1987, when a stunning Chadianmilitary offensive drove the Libyans out.   Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's leader, then recognized Habre'sgovernment and agreed to a cease-fire, although a permanentsettlement has proved elusive and occasional clashes have beenreported.   Habre has tried to unite the many rebellious factions in thecountry, sometimes through repression and sometimes by making pactsthat gave the rebel leaders important posts in his government.</TEXT></DOC>
