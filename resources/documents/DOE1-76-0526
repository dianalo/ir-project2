Seventeen countries now operate geothermal power plants.The total installed capacity is 3 GW, with individual units ranging insize from a few hundred kilowatts to 135 MW. The identified but as yetuntapped reserves are measured in the tens of giga-watts; the ultimateresource is immense. In this article, the authors trace the origins ofgeothermal power, following its growth from about the year 1900. Theauthors identify major milestones in the development of the technology,present a snapshot of the state of development around the world as of1987 and look to the future for possible growth scenarios.</TEXT></DOC>
