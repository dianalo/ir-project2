The other four senators under investigation receivedreprimands for their dealings with former thrift executiveCharles Keating. The case against them effectively ends.</LP><TEXT>   Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) and Donald Riegle (D.,Mich.) engaged in conduct that &quot;gave the appearance of beingimproper,&quot; according to the report. And the ethics panel saidthat Sens. John Glenn (D., Ohio) and John McCain (R., Ariz.)&quot;exercised poor judgment&quot; in their dealings with Mr. Keating.The decision by the six-member ethics panel was unanimous.   In strong language, the panel said that Sen. Cranston had&quot;engaged in an impermissible pattern of conduct in whichfund-raising and official activities were substantiallylinked.&quot; The panel recommended that the investigation againstthe California Democrat continue. Sen. Cranston's case, afterhe has had a chance to respond to the specific chargesagainst him, is almost certain to go before the full Senatefor a possible censure vote.   A censure recommendation against Sen. Cranston wouldrequire majority approval of the full Senate and couldtrigger a bitter debate on the floor.   In a prepared statement, Sen. Cranston said, &quot;It's clearthat I have been unfairly singled out despite the evidence inall five cases.&quot;   From the outset of the committee's 14-month probe, whichinvolved allegations that the five senators improperlyintervened with federal regulators on Mr. Keating's behalf,Sen. Cranston appeared the most likely target of serioussanctions. He was the most active in helping Mr. Keating andthe most aggressive in soliciting political contributionsfrom him, according to the panel's special counsel, RobertBennett.   Sen. Cranston and political groups affiliated with himreceived nearly $900,000 of the $1.3 million in contributionsmade by Mr. Keating and his associates to the five senators.Until Mr. Keating's California thrift was seized by thegovernment in April 1989 -- at an anticipated cost totaxpayers of more than $2 billion -- Sen. Cranston was astaunch ally in Mr. Keating's fierce battle with federalbanking regulators, according to Mr. Bennett.   But the senator, who has been in his home staterecuperating from cancer treatment, suggested in an angryletter to the ethics panel last week that his illness andsubsequent announced political retirement in 1992 have madehim a &quot;scapegoat&quot; in the Keating case. By citing only Mr.Cranston for probable punishment, the Senate spares itselfthe wrenching ordeal of putting a group of senators -- and byextension, the Senate itself -- on trial.   The panel's findings drew immediate criticism. FredWertheimer, president of Common Cause, which filed theoriginal ethics complaint against the five senators inOctober 1989, lambasted the committee's action as a &quot;cop-out&quot;and a &quot;damning indictment of the committee.&quot; Mr. Wertheimercited the dropping of the cases against Sens. DeConcini andRiegle as being &quot;indefensible.&quot;   Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), the ranking Republican onthe panel, defended the committee's findings and said theycontained &quot;strong language&quot; that would be made part of theSenate record. &quot;The words speak for themselves,&quot; he asserted.But Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), who was thought to favortougher punishment for some of the senators, said he was not&quot;totally satisfied&quot; with the committee's action.   The ethics panel was deeply torn over how to resolve theKeating case, in part because Senate rules do not barlawmakers from intervening with federal regulators on behalfof constituents or from taking actions that benefitcontributors. In the preliminary report, the panelrecommended that the Senate establish bipartisan committeesto spell out clear rules on proper constituent services andregulatory intervention and to develop stricter campaignfinance laws.   All five senators insisted that Mr. Keating'scontributions didn't influence their actions, although in Mr.Cranston's case, there was damaging evidence that requestsfor contributions from Mr. Keating were often closely timedwith actions taken by the senator or his office. Lacking suchclear-cut connections in the other four cases, the ethicspanel was forced to apply a more general prohibition againstgovernment officials creating &quot;an appearance&quot; of improprietyin their actions. It also accused all four senators of usingpoor judgment.   For their part, the four senators expressed relief thatthe long investigation was behind them. Sen. DeConcini, whomounted the most vigorous defense during two months of publichearings, said &quot;aggressiveness is my hallmark.&quot; The ethicspanel, however, concluded that his &quot;aggressive conduct withthe regulators was inappropriate.&quot; Sen. Riegle called theresolution of his case &quot;fair and constructive.&quot;   For the 76-year-old Mr. Cranston, who until early thisyear was the Democratic Whip, the Keating ethics case has hada devastating political effect. While polls indicate theethical charges have weakened all five senators in their homestates, Sen. Cranston's approval ratings have plummeted. Arecent statewide poll showed more than half of the Californiavoters believe Sen. Cranston, who was elected to the Senatein 1968, should resign now rather than finish his term.   ---   Jackie Calmes contributed to this article.   ---                       Alan Cranston                                                                                                          Democrat, California   Announced retirement when term expires in 1992                                                                                                          COMMITTEE FINDINGS:   Engaged in an impermissible pattern of conduct in whichfund-raising and official activities were substantiallylinked; sets stage for further action by entire Senate.
