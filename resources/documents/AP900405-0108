DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservatives are flourishing in America butit will be some time before they have another Ronald Reagan tocheer, leaders of a conservative think tank said Thursday.   Top officials of the Heritage Foundation which had close ties tothe Reagan administration, released a ``State of Conservatism''message, saying President Bush is following up on his predecessor'sconservative agenda but is no match for him at inspiring followers.   ``George Bush might in fact come along at the end of four yearswith an enactment record as conservative as Ronald Reagan's was atthe end of his first term, but clearly his rhetoric is not whatconservatives are looking for,'' said Heritage president Edwin J.Feulner Jr.   Feulner conceded that this is ``a problem in terms of buildingand maintaining a movement.'' Nevertheless, he said, ``there are alot of good conservative institutions out there that are doing verywell.''   ``Sure we miss Reagan,'' said Burton Yale Pines, senior vicepresident of the foundation. ``Democrats for a half century havebeen looking for a successor to Franklin Roosevelt. ... We're goingto be looking for a long time for the next Ronald Reagan.''   ``I think it is going to take a while for a new political personto come along to build on the Reagan legacy and claim that turf,''said Feulner. ``I don't see him out there today.''   Feulner said Roosevelt's New Deal, formulated in the 1930's, didnot come to fruition until the Johnson administration's GreatSociety in the 1960's.   ``Similarly,'' he said,``because Ronald Reagan came to town andenunciated some radically different and new ideas, it would beutopian for conservatives to think that by the time he left town inJanuary 1989, those ideas would all be in place. It's going to be along-term process.   ``Critics from the left and the right are saying that we arecracking up or that we have lost our cohesion, but I believe theconservative movement is healthy, alive and well today,'' Feulnersaid.   He conceded, however, that conservatives ``are in a difficultbind ... between those who believe a certain level of the welfarestate is more or less acceptable'' and those who do not. He saidHeritage believes ``there is a certain minimal role of governmentthat conservatives, at least those involved in the policy processin Washington, ought to be willing to accept and try and promotenew ways of looking at these problems.   ``It is almost a generational kind of question,'' said Feulner,a veteran of the conservative movement who has headed Heritagesince 1977. ``We are being accused by our successors of beingrather squishy.''   He said this conflict is ``in some respects personified'' in thecontrast betwen Reagan's rhetoric and Bush's, yet, ``I see the twoof them, in terms of their policies, basically one following theother.''   In the message, distributed in advance of the meeting, Feulnerwrote that Reagan ``sought power to give it away _ to states,localities, private enterprise, and institutions that ... makeAmericans actively involved citizens instead of resentfultaxpayers.''   ``In view of the obstacles he confronted, it's amazing he got asfar as he did,'' Feulner said. ``But it wasn't far beyond thestarting blocks.''   In domestic affairs, the foundation president urgedconservatives to press for such things as ``giving parents thefreedom to choose the schools their children attend, empoweringtenants to manage the public housing projects where they live, andproviding business incentives to invest in poor inner-cityneighborhoods.''   Turning to world affairs, he said that ``because of our successin rolling back communism, there is no longer much consensus onwhat constitutes a ``conservative foreign policy.''   ``This isn't the place to set forth a new conservative foreignpolicy agenda,'' he added. ``But it is the place to acknowledgethat in an era when even many communists have turnedanti-communist, anti-communism is no longer enough to unify andenergize conservatives.''   The message was published by the foundation, under the title``Conservatism in a New Age,'' as a supplement to its annual report.</TEXT></DOC>
