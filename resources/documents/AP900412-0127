Samir Geagea's militia released five Moslem suspects it had heldfor more than two years on charges of ``disrupting order'' in theChristian enclave.   The militia command, in a statement, said the move was a``goodwill gesture'' on the eve of the 15th anniversary of thecivil war, which broke out April 13, 1975.   The five were released from Geagea's war council headquarters ineast Beirut and turned over to the International Committee of theRctors of Kesrouan with machine-gun fire from theirmountaintop positions.   Aoun's men control the Metn mountains that border the easternflank of Kesrouan Province. The southeastern sector of east Beirutand the city's eastern suburbs also are dominated by Aoun's army.   Geagea's militia controls the provinces of Kesrouan and Byblosnorth of Beirut as well as the capital's waterfront.   The thud of exploding shells echoed across Beirut as local radiostations interrupted regular programming to flash reports of theconfrontation.   Geagea's command, in a statement broadcast by Voice of Lebanonradio, blamed the escalation on Aoun. It accused him of ``blockingGeagea's peace offensive that aims at turning over our areas to thelegitimate authorities.''   Aoun's Radio Lebanon accused Geagea of ``selling out theliberated areas to Syria's surrogates.''   Geagea repeatedly has urged the Syrian-backed government ofPresident Elias Hrawi to take over army garrisons and governmentinstallations in the Christian enclave.   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's election Nov. 24. Hrawi was elected inline with an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's civilwar. Aoun refused to accept the plan because it did not include atimetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.   Geagea has said the plan was a way to peace and recognized Hrawias the head of state.</TEXT></DOC>
