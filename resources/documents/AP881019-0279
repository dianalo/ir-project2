(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first negotiating session innearly 17 months between striking United Auto Workers and officialsof the Colt Firearms Division broke off Wednesday after just 14minutes of mediated talks.   ``There was no movement,'' said Robert Madore, president of UAWLocal 376. ``We met (separately) for about 12 minutes, broke up,came back face to face for another two minutes and broke up.''   Madore said the company and the union are still deadlocked overthe issue of whether the company can keep the 725 replacementworkers it has hired to replace the strikers.   ``The company's position is that the replacement workers stay,''Madore said. ``We're not going to cave in on that. All the strikershave to go back.''   Richard Reibeling, vice president for personnel at Colt FirearmsDivision and the company's chief negotiator, said the two partiesare ``180 degrees apart,'' with the issue of replacement workers atthe center of the dispute.   The strike began in January 1986 when 1,000 members of UAW Local376 struck over a failure of both sides to reach a new contractafter months of negotiations.   The company hired replacements at its Hartford and West Hartfordplants and production has continued throughout the strike. Inaddition, 200 union members have returned to work, companyofficials said.   Wednesday's talks, held under the guidance of state and federalmediators at the state Department of Labor offices in Wethersfield,were the first since negotiators for the union and Colt met on May27, 1987.   State Department of Labor spokesman Richard Ficks said no datehas been set for future talks.</TEXT></DOC>
