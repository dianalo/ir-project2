Economists are warning of a possible recession, a growing crisis facing Israeli industry and a sharp rise in unemployment. Several large unions were threatening strikes even as election day approached.    The economy cropped up in the campaign last week when Koor, the nation's largest industrial conglomerate, had to be bailed out by the government after it defaulted on a $20 million loan.    Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir immediately turned that into a rallying cry for an end to Labor Party-backed policies that traditionally have preserved jobs regardless of the cost. &quot;The concept of the Labor Party belongs to the past, it belongs to east Europe at the beginning of the century,&quot; Mr. Shamir said in a speech, calling for &quot;a free economy and free enterprise.&quot;    Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, though he has a say in the coalition government along with Mr. Shamir, responded by blaming the prime minister's Likud bloc for tight money policies and high interest rates that have hampered industrial growth and moved the economy precariously close to recession.    &quot;Today there are 3,000 plants in distress,&quot; Mr. Peres charged in a televised debate with Mr. Shamir. &quot;What plant can pay 30% to 35% interest? This entire policy rocks the economy.&quot;    How voters will respond to the rhetoric remains unclear. Hanoch Smith, an independent pollster, says surveys so far have shown &quot;a standoff between the two main parties&quot; on economic issues.    Mr. Peres's Labor Party appears more vulnerable than Likud, because the Labor-allied Histadrut trade union federation owns or controls many of the ailing industries, chief among them Koor and the nation's largest insurance company.    Koor, with annual revenue of about $3 billion, has more than 27,000 employees and accounts for 14% of Israel's industrial output.    Only a few months earlier, the Histadrut's ailing Alliance Tire andamp; Rubber Co. northeast of Tel Aviv was put in the hands of a state-appointed receiver, and Israeli banks put up $8 million in emergency loans to keep the company afloat. After a three-month closure, the tire plant was reopened Oct. 5 but 250 workers weren't recalled.    Mr. Shamir has hammered Mr. Peres for Histadrut's ills, but the uneasy coalition between the two men's parties -- with their opposite philosophies -- has prevented the government from reaching long-term solutions to Israel's economic woes.    Ironically, economists say, Israel's current industrial problems stem in part from its success in dealing with another economic problem faced when the coalition came to power -- inflation.    In 1984, consumer prices were rising a record 445% a year. The Labor-Likud coalition government in July 1985 enacted an &quot;emergency stabilization program&quot; with wage and price freezes, stringent monetary controls and tight budget policies that have brought inflation down to about 16% a year.    Though the government has since eased up to allow limited wage and price increases, continuing high interest rates and strict exchange-rate controls have squeezed business profits.    Also, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has resulted in the loss of millions of dollars for the tourist industry and other businesses that traditionally depend on Arab workers, such as construction and textiles.    One Western-trained economist, who insisted on anonymity, predicted that the Israeli economy would grow 1% or less in 1988, well below the government's target of 3.7% and down sharply from the 5.2% growth in 1987.    The nation's unemployment rate rose from 5.6% at the end of 1987 to nearly 6% in the first half of 1988, and some economists believe it hit 7% in the July-September quarter.    At the Israel Manufacturers Association, Moshe Nahum, an economist, said statistics show a decline in industrial production and hours worked by employees in the first half of the year. Exporters are being hurt most, he said, with some of them selling at a loss, because their costs are rising while the exchange rate on overseas earnings remains frozen by the government.    Yacov Sheinin, chairman of the Tel Aviv forecasting firm Economic Models Ltd., said that despite signs the economy began slowing 10 months ago, &quot;The public remains more concerned about a possible rekindling of inflation than an economic downturn.&quot; He added: &quot;If it continues to slow down and run into a recession, which I think it could after the election, the situation will be different.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
