Chairman Roger Smithreceived at least $2.2 million for 1987 in salary, exercised stockoptions and stock grants, the nation's largest automaker reportedFriday in its proxy statement.   Smith received $867,000 in salary, earned $513,121 exercisingstock options and was awarded a stock bonus worth $800,000 when itwas granted on Dec. 7. The stock, issued in blocks over athree-year period that began in January, is worth considerably morenow.   GM President Robert Stempel received at least $1.2 million for1987: $517,000 in salary, $73,523 on exercised stock options and$600,000 in the stock bonus. Stempel became president in August,when he replaced the retired F. James McDonald.   In all, GM paid $13.6 million in 1987 salaries to its top 58executives and gave stock awards worth $16.2 million on Dec. 7 and$21.1 million on Friday to 4,961 executives.   Ford Motor Co., the No. 2 automaker, paid $247.9 million inbonuses for 1987 to 5,166 executives, it reported in a proxystatement mailed Tuesday.   Ford Vice Chairman Harold Poling earned nearly $11 million in1987: $808,697 in salary, $2 million in cash bonuses and nearly$8.1 million on exercised stock options.   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen, who exercised no stock options,received $2.8 million in cash bonuses and $929,934 in salary.   GM's profit rose to $3.6 billion in 1987 from $2.95 billion in1986, but for the second year in a row it earned too little on itsU.S. automaking business to pay profit-sharing to its 350,000hourly U.S. workers.   The outcry over the millions of dollars executives received inbonuses for 1986 prompted GM's board of directors in 1987 to switchto an all-stock bonus and spread each stock grant over severalyears.   United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber and VicePresident Donald Ephlin said the 1987 compensation received by topGM executives ``still can't be justified rationally and constitutesan insult to common sense and fairness.''   During a time when GM's automaking business is earning solittle, they said in a statement, ``we will leave the executives toforego all increases and supplementary awards in the spirit ofshared sacrifice.''   Ford distributed a record $636 million in profit-sharing checksin March to more than 156,000 hourly and salaried employees, anaverage of more than $4,000 each.   On Friday, GM's common stock closed at $72.75 a share, up from$71.62{. GM Class E stock, based on earnings of its Electronic DataSystems Corp. subsidiary, declined to $41 a share from $41.62{.   GM Class H stock, based on earnings of GM Hughes ElectronicsCorp., closed at $30.25 a share, up from $30.   When the stock bonuses were granted Dec. 7, GM common stock wasworth $56.19 a share, Class E stock was worth $31.19 a share andClass H stock was worth $23.22 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
