The Iraqi National Assembly earlier Tuesday overwhelminglyendorsed the Iraqi president's proposal to release all Frenchnationals held in Iraq and Kuwait.   Le Pen, who has urged expulsion of Moslem immigrants in France,has been highly critical of France's role in the multinationalforce amassed following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He beganprivate contacts with Baghdad to seek a peaceful solution to theconflict.   There have been no reports of when or if French hostages couldbe released. About 330 French citizens are held in Iraq or Kuwait,including 67 at strategic sites as a deterrent against militaryattack, according to the French Foreign Ministry.   Saddam made the proposal to free French hostages Monday ``inappreciation to liberal French people's rejection'' of U.S.policies toward Iraq, and in support of President FrancoisMitterrand's desire for a peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis,the official Iraqi News Agency reported.   A statement from Le Pen's National Front party indicated ahigh-level party delegation would shortly leave for Iraq ``at theinvitation of Iraqi authorities.''   ``A National Front delegation ... will occupy itself first ofall with the fate of the French who find themselves there as wellas the other Europeans,'' Le Pen told the French television networkLa Cinq.   But Le Pen said he will only go to Iraq if all the hostages arefreed.   Iraqi's French Ambassador Abdul Razzak Rachid al-Hachimi refusedto confirm whether the delegation would take home hostages.   ``We prefer and we hope that a French government official willgo to Baghdad to bring the French nationals back, that's forsure,'' al-Hachimi said in a La Cinq interview.   Hubert Vedrine, a spokesman for Mitterrand, declined comment onthe Iraqi decision. The Iraqi assembly endorsed Saddam'shostage-release proposal in a 248-2 vote, Iraqi officials said.   Earlier Tuesday, Premier Michel Rocard and some legislators helda meeting dedicated to the French hostages.   Bernard Stasi, a centrist member of the National Assembly,quoted Rocard as saying the release would be ``a unilateraldecision taken by Iraq.''   ``The taking of hostages is odious,'' the Foreign Ministry saidin a communique. ``Their release is no more than an atonement foran unacceptable act. France cannot accept any sort of negotiationon the subject.''   But the ministry said France would take measures to repatriatethe hostages if they are freed.   Saddam's proposal has been viewed as an attempt to split theWest's anti-Iraq alliance by creating the impression that Francewas negotiating its own deal.   France, with 13,000 troops deployed in the gulf region,represents the second largest Western military force after theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
