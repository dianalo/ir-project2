In General 1. The price cap proposal we adopt for regulating dominant carriers \1\<NOTE/> is designed to replicate better than traditional rate-of-returnregulation the incentives to efficiency that characterize a competitivemarket. The essential premise underlying the proposal is that by limitingthe rates carriers may charge, rather than their rates of return, pricecaps will drive carriers to avoid unnecessary costs, invest in efficiencyenhancing technology, and employ innovative service approaches in orderto earn the greatest levels of return within the applicable rate limitations.At the same time, the plan guarantees that ratepayers obtain their shareof expected productivity gains first, with carriers retaining any additionalprofits they may generate. Thus, the plan promises that both ratepayersand carriers will be better off than under traditional regulation. In arrivingat our proposal, we have considered alternative regulatory approaches adoptedby other jurisdictions, in particular, in Great Britain and the State ofNew York.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The proposed price cap plan would be applicable to AmericanTelephone and Telegraph Company (ATandamp;T) and the local exchange carriers(LECs). We tentatively conclude that extending the price cap plan to Comsator to Alascom is not warranted at this time. If, however, ATandamp;T electsprice caps, the plan would apply to Alascom to the extent that Alascomconcurred in ATandamp;T tariffs.2. During an initial period of four years, the price cap plan will operatein concert with existing regulation and will be available on an electivebasis to ATandamp;T and to any LECs not electing to participate in eitherthe common line or traffic sensitive pools administered by the NationalExchange Carrier Association (NECA). At the end of the third year, we willconduct a comprehensive performance review of the plan's operation. Inview of our long-standing policy of structuring regulation to harmonizewith developing or existing competition, we seek coment on our tentativedecision to rely on competitive distinctions between the interstate interexchangeand interstate access markets as a means of differentiating price cap implementationfor ATandamp;T and the LECs, and on whether such competitive differencesmerit providing ATandamp;T with greater flexibility. 3. Because of the importance we attach to safeguarding the integrity ofjurisdictional allocations, we seek comment on what, if any, unique effectprice caps may have on this process, and what, if any, specific changesin existing monitoring procedures might be required to offset such an effect.II. Legal Authority 4. We reiterate our initial tentative conclusion that we are not legallyrequired to continue rate-of-return regulation of dominant carriers. Furthermore,we tentatively conclude that the Communications Act and relevant judicialprecedent empower this Commission to address the demonstrated limitationsof rate-of-return regulation with the modest, but important, reforms thatwe propose in this Further Notice. 5. Rather than insisting on a single regulatory method for determiningwhether rates are just and reasonable, courts evaluate whether the endresults of particlar regulatory schemes produce rates that fall withina ``zone of reasonableness'' bounded at the one end by investor interestin maintaining financial integrity and access to capital markets, and atthe other end of the consumer interest in being charged non-exploitativerates.\2\<NOTE/> The substantive mandate under which we operate requires onlythat we select a reasonable ratemaking approach that is capable of drivingrates into the zone of reasonableness, or of detecting and correcting forthe failure of market forces to do so.\3\<NOTE/> We tentatively conclude that our price cap proposal, andthe manner, detailed below, in which it takes account of carrier costsand profits, satisfies the Act's substantive requirement of ensuring justand reasonable rates. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Jersey Cent. Power andamp; Light v. FERC,</T3> 810 F.2d 168, 1177-78(D.C. Cir. 1987) (en banc). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Farmers Unions Cent. Exch. v. FERC,</T3> 734 F.2d 1486, 1509 (D.C.Cir.), <T3>cert denied</T3>, 469 U.S. 1034 (1984). 6. Moreover, our proposals represent to a large extent, simply the consideredexercise of our discretionary power regarding suspension of tariffs undersection 204 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. 204, and of our authority to modify tarifffiling procedures under section 203 of the statute, 47 U.S.C. 203. Ourprice cap plan establishes a ``no-suspension zone'' for tariffs that proposerate level changes falling within applicable cap and band limits, and subjectssuch tariffs to streamlined filing and review procedures. Above-cap orabove-band filings, on the other hand, would generally be suspended and,therefore, subject to full tariff scrutiny. In this respect the plan issimilar to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) tariff rules that were upheldin the 1984 District of Columbia Circuit decision in <T3>Advanced Micro Devices.</T3>\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>Advanced Micro Devices v. CAB</T3>, 742 F.2d 1520, 1531 (D.C. Cir.1984). 7. Although we believe that the proposed reforms will ensure just and reasonablerates and advance the objectives of the Communications Act more effectivelythan rate-of-return regulation, we do not propose an affirmative prescriptionof just and reasonable rates in implementing price cap regulation. We tentativelyconclude that such a course could delay implementation without any countervailingbenefits. We seek comment regarding why the benefits of price cap regulationcannot be achieved though our proposed no-suspension zone policy. III. Scope of Price Cap Regulation <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Services Covered </ITAG>8. The proposed regulatory model will regulate rates through a system ofaggregate caps on specified service groups (``baskets''), and rate element-specificbands. It wil cap all of ATandamp;T's existing services, except the carrier'sTariff 5 Special Construction services, Tariff 12 services (including SpecialRouting Arrangement Service, Defense Commercial Telecommunications Network,Digital Tandem Switched Network and Arrangements, and Virtual TelecommunicationsNetwork Service), and services subject to separate, ``below-the-line''accounting requirements (such as Accunet Packet Switching and Skynet KU).For participating LECs, the proposal will cap all existing services, exceptthe common line element, and services contained in special constructionand individual case basis (ICB) tariffs. The excepted service categorieswill remain subject to conventional 45-day tariff notice and existing tariffreview requirements. Revenues and costs associated with such services willbe segregated from those of capped services for carrier performance reviewpurposes. 9. We tentatively propose to include the carrier common line (CCL) elementin price cap regulation as part of the annual access tariff filing thattakes effect in 1990; we do not propose to include this rate element inprice cap regulation from the outset, because at the time price caps begin,on April 1, 1989, there will be no tested depooled CCL rates. At the timethat common line is brought into the cap, we propose to use a total commonline rate per minute in the price cap formula (computed as if there wereno end user charges) rather than using the CCL charge, and to cap the CCLcharge at the difference between the common line charge per minute andthe end user charge per minute (i.e., total end user revenues divided bythe same demand number used to compute common line revenues per minute).Alternatively, we propose to use an index of the price per line, ratherthan the price per minute, as the common line component of the PCI. Wealso propose to require that CCL price reductions associated with demandstimulation caused by exogenous revenue changes be treated as exogenous.We seek comment on whether we need to adjust the productivity factor wepropose to apply to the LECs because of our proposed exclusion of commonline from April 1989 through July 1990 and on whether we need to adjustthe productivity factor after common line is brought into price cap regulationat the conclusion of that period.10. Our proposal provides that new services, which by definition includeonly those services offering users an additional measure of choice, willinitially be offered outside of the price cap structure. Subsequently,such services will be brought under caps based upon the historical priceand revenue figures that were established during the period outside thecap. On the other hand, restructured services, defined as those involvingthe modification of a method of charging or provisioning for an existingservice, or the introduction of a new method of charging or provisioning,will remain subject to price cap regulation from the outset. As is thecase under existing procedures, the degree of rate structure flexibilityaccorded ATandamp;T and the LECs under price cap regulation differs. TheLECs must maintain the rate structure established in Part 69 of this Commission'sRules, or petition for a waiver of the prescribed rate structure.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Initiation of Price Cap Regulation</ITAG>11. We tentatively conclude that existing prices are the most appropriatestarting point for the beginning price cap regulation. Alternatively, however,we seek comment on whether we should capture consumer benefits from pricecaps by means of a higher short-term productivity factor, in lieu of ourcurrent proposal to ensure benefits to ratepayers by including an additionalincrement in the productivity adjustment on an on-going basis.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Baskets and Bands</ITAG>12. We tentatively decide that a combination of ``baskets'' (aggregatecaps) and ``bands'' (maximum and minimum limits on individual service prices)would best satisfy the objectives which guide our determination of whata ``price cap'' is. The weighted average of the prices of services withina basket must remain below the Price Cap Index (PCI). For ATandamp;T, theproposal contemplates creation of two baskets_one for private line services,and one for services, such as MTS, international MTS, and WATS, that usethe switched network. Similarly, capped LEC services will be separatedinto a switched access basket, and another basket for all other services,consisting primarily of special access services, but also including LECinterexchange services.13. We also propose to add individual rate element bands as additionalprotections for consumers. By band we refer to the range within which acarrier may raise or lower any individual rate element in any year andstill be entitled to streamlined review. All rate changes within or abovea band are ``credited'' or counted in the Actual Price Index (API) forpurposes of measuring compliance with the PCI. Rate reductions below theband, however, would not be credited. The bands, after applying the PCI,would permit a 5 percent fluctuation above and below existing rates. Wealso solicit comment on an alternative proposal to apply more focused pricingrules to MTS services used by residential and small business customers.IV. Tariff Filing Procedures<ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General</ITAG>14. The plan established new tariff filing and review procedures for participatingcarriers. For each basket of services, the plan proposes a ceiling on theaggregate revenue-weighted rates that may be charged if a carrier is toreceive streamlined filing and review treatment for its tariff. Under thisapproach, carriers are given flexibility in setting rate levels for individualservices within the baskets, although, through rate element-specific bands,we propose to restrain the maximum annual change in the rates for eachservice to protect ratepayers and to discourage potentially anticompetitivepractices. As described below, the applicable cap for each basket of serviceswill be expressed through the mechanisms of a price cap index (PCI), whichmeasures changes in inflation, productivity, and certain specific costsbeyond a carrier's control. Compliance with the cap will be measured throughthe mechanism of an actual price index (API), an index or aggregate revenue-weightedproposed rates within a basket, and a base price index (BPI), and indexof that basket's aggregate revenue-weighted average rates during the ``baseyear''_the 12-month period ending six months prior to the effective dateof each annual price cap tariff.15. Within the aggregate ceilings established for each basket of services,the plan provides for bands (described in more detail in Section V.B, <T3>infra</T3>) that limit the degree to which individual rate elementprices may fluctuate during any given year while retaining streamlinedtariff filing and review treatment. Rate decreases below a band's lowerboundary may be permitted upon a demonstration that the proposed rate coversthe cost of providing the service. However, as explained below, the carrierreceives no credit for the below-band rates in calculating compliance withthe basket's aggregate rate ceiling.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Annual Filings</ITAG>16. The proposal provides that initial price cap tariffs must be filedby the LECs on December 30, 1988, with an effective date of April 1, 1989.ATandamp;T's initial price cap tariff must be filed on February 16, 1989,with an April 1 effective date. Thereafter, the effective date of annualprice cap tariffs would be July 1, and LECs must continue to file annualprice cap tariffs on 90 days' notice, while ATandamp;T would continue tofile on 45 days' notice. The notice period for ATandamp;T reflects the factthat (as under current practice) the ATandamp;T filing must incorporate proposedaccess rate changes filed by the LECs. As part of the annual filing, carriersmust demonstrate that they have made appropriate adjustments to their PCIsand BPIs according to the required procedures. In order to receive streamlinedtreatment and to avoid likely tariff suspension, they must also demonstratethat their APIs do not exceed applicable PCIs. Carriers electing pricecap regulation are not otherwise required to comply with traditional costsupport filing requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Streamlined Review </ITAG>17. The plan provides that once the annual PCI adjustments have becomeeffective, rate level changes within applicable cap and band limits willbe subject to streamlined tariff filing and review treatment. Such tariffsmay be filed on 14 days' notice, shall be <T3>prima facie </T3>lawful, and need be accompanied only by a showingthat the proposed prices are at or below the PCI ceiling and are withinthe price band. Such rates normally will not be subject to suspension,unless this Commission determines on our own or upon challenge by a petitioner(1) that there is a high probability that the tariff would be found unlawfulunder section 201 or section 202 of the Communications Act (or under anyother provision of the Act or any other statutory or other legal requirements)after investigation; (2) that suspension would not substantially harm otherparties; (3) that irreparable injury would be suffered if suspension doesnot issue; and (4) that the suspension would not otherwise harm the publicinterest. Current complaint procedures under section 208 of the CommunicationsAct would not be altered by the price cap plan. And, upon suspension orinvestigation of a tariff, current procedures under section 204 of theAct would remain unchanged.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Above-Cap or Out-of-Band Rate Filings</ITAG>18. Tariffs containing above-cap or above-band rates must be filed on 90days' notice and will be subject to full regulatory scrutiny under theprice cap proposal. Tariffs proposing above-cap rates must be accompaniedby cost support data covering each rate in the basket for the entire periodunder price caps, and a detailed explanation of the carrier's cost allocationmethodology. The carrier must demonstrate that the proposed above-cap ratesare just and reasonable by showing, for example, that such rates are essentialto attract capital sufficient to conduct its business. In the case of above-bandfilings, carriers must demonstrate ``substantial cause'' for the rate increase.Since applicable cap and band limits reflect this Commission's tentativeview of the dividing line between reasonable and unreasonable rates, above-capor above-band filings presumptively will be subject to suspension and investigation.Tariffs containing below-band rates must be filed on 45 days' notice andmust be accompanied by a showing that the rates are sufficient to coverthe cost of providing the service.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Review of New and Restructured Services</ITAG>19. New service offerings outside the cap must be filed on 45 days' noticeand must be accompanied by a demonstration that they meet the ``net revenue''test. Thus, the carrier must establish that the service, and each unbundledelement thereof, will generate a net revenue increase_measured againstrevenues generated from services in the same basket, and calculated basedon present value_within a 24-month period after an annual price cap tariffincluding the new service takes effect, or within 36 months from the datethe new service becomes effective, whichever occurs first. Capped servicesthat have been restructured shall remain under price cap regulation. However,rate restructuring will be subject to 45 days' notice and, in order toavoid likely suspension, must be accompanied by a showing that the proposedrestructuring will not drive the affected API above its respective PCI.Minor text changes will continue to be subject to existing tariff reviewprocedures.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Review  </ITAG>20. At the end of the third year under price cap regulation, this Commissionwill commence a comprehensive examination of the price cap plan. This reviewwill consider all available measures of market and carrier performance,including the level of actual prices, achieved rates of return, qualityof service, and technological progressiveness. While the plan proposesthat no retroactive payments will be exacted from carriers for high profitlevels achieved under price caps, the review may lead to adjustments tothe overall level of price caps in future years, if such changes are foundto be appropriate.V. Operation of Price Cap Adjustment Mechanisms21. As noted above, the plan contemplates creation of a price cap index,a base price index, and an actual price index for each basket of services.The PCI is an index of change in the cost of factors of production (<T3>i.e., </T3>inflation), carrier productivity, and certain carrier-specificcost factors that are beyond the carrier's control. The PCI is adjustedannually to account for changes in its component cost factors, and it actsas a ceiling above which he index of proposed prices within the basket,the API, cannot go without full regulatory scrutiny. Similarly, the BPIis adjusted annually to reflet the basket's aggregate revenue-weightedaverage rates during the base year, and is used as a benchmark againstwhich proposed rates are measured in calculating the API.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Basic Formulas and Calculations</ITAG>1. <T3>PCI Adjustments. </T3>22. Broadly speaking, the PCI is adjusted accordingto the following formula:<ITAG tagnum="26">Proportion change to the price cap index = w (I^X)/100+DY/R+DZ/R</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where I = the percentage change in the GNP-PI,\5\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The GNP-Price Index (GNP-PI) (a fixed-weight price indexproduced by the U.S. Department of Commerce) is employed instead of thebetter known Consumer Price Index or Producer Price Index, because it exhibitsless volatility over time, and is more broadly based to better reflectcarriers' actual cost experience. The GNP-PI is published in the <T3>Survey of Current Business </T3>at Table 7.1 and in the <T3>Economic Report of the President </T3>at Table B-4.<ITAG tagnum="26">X = productivty factor of 3.0%,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">w = the fraction of base period gross revenues represented by non-accesscosts net of DZ (as defined below) divided by base period gross revenues,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DY = the dollar magnitude of any change in access charges for theupcoming tariff year, evaluated at base period demand,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DZ = the dollar magnitude of any other exogenous cost changes, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">R = base period gross revenues.</ITAG>The productivity factor ``X'' reflects the conclusion that the telecommunicationsindustry's productivity gains have in the recent past exceeded those ofthe economy as a whole by approximately 2.5 percent annually. In orderto share the benefits of price caps with ratepayers and to induce carriersto achieve greater productivity gains, the Further Notice assigns ``X''a value of 3 percent. Carrier-specific exogenous cost changes which arerepresented by the term ``DZ,'' include those caused by (1) changes intax laws; (2) the completion of the amortization of depreciation reservedeficiencies and inside wiring costs; (3) changes in the Uniform Systemof Accounts (USOA); and (4) changes in the Separations Manual.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ We seek additional comment on whether changes in internationalaccounting rates should be included as a ``Y'' factor under the PCI adjustmentformula.23. The actual mechanics of adjusting the PCI are slightly more complexthan the formula described above. The initial base year PCI for each basketwill be assigned a value of 100. However, the PCI must be adjusted at thetime of the initial price cap filing, and at every annual filing thereafter,to reflect changes in costs. Adjustments to the PCI would be made pursuantto the following formula:<ITAG tagnum="26">PCI (new) = PCI (base) [1.0 + w (I - X) / 100 + DY/R + DZ/R].</ITAG>2. <T3>API and BPI Adjustments. </T3>24. Under the plan, the initial BPI foreach basket of services is established using the revenue-weighted averagerates of the basket's services in effect during the first base year (the12-month period ending September 30, 1988). Like the initial base yearPCIs, the initial BPIs will be assigned a value of 100. Beginning withthe initial price cap tariff filing, the carrier will propose prices forthe services in each basket. For each such service, the ratio of its proposednew price to its average price in the base year is calculated. Thus, foreach service, the ratio is calculated as the proposed price for the comingyear, denoted as p2, divided by its average price during the base year,p1. This term (p2/p1) will be multiplied by the corresponding weight thatshould be attached to that price. The sum of all such terms (representingweights multiplied by price ratios) is multiplied by the BPI value to determinethe API value. The weights applied to the price ratios described aboveare the ratios of revenues generated by each corresponding service to totalbasket revenues during the base year. Denoting these weights as ``v'' andthe services by the index ``i,'' the API is derived according to the followingformula:<ITAG tagnum="26">API = BPI [Sivi (p2/p1)<T2>i</T2>]</ITAG>25. The BPIs are adjusted in each annual price cap filing following theinaugural filing to reflect the change in revenue-weighted average ratesin a basket one base period to the next. Each adjustment is made pursuantto the following formula:<ITAG tagnum="26">BPI = BPI (previous year) [Sivi (p2/p1)<T2>i</T2>]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">   where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">BPI (previous year) = the BPI from the base year preceding the mostrecently completed base year,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p2 = the average price (revenue divided by quantity) of a ratableelement during the most recently completed base year,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p1 = the average price (revenue divided by quantity) of a ratableelement during the base year preceding the most recently completed baseyear,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">v = the ratio of revenues generated by a ratable element during thebase year preceding the most recently completed base year to the basket'stotal revenues during that base year, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> i = the ratable elements in the basket.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Reductions Below Price Floors</ITAG>26. Excepted from the basic API adjustment formula described above areprice reductions beneath the plan's lower band boundaries. Rate bands fora rate element define a zone within five percentage points above or belowan amount equal to the rate that prevailed on the last day of the baseyear, increased or decreased (as appropriate) by the percentage changein the current PCI compared to the previous PCI. The portion of a proposedrate reduction that falls below the band will be disregarded for the purposeof calculating the API.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Calculations for News Services</ITAG>27. The plan provides that new services introduced during any base yearare to be brought into the API, and consequently made subject to the pricinglimitations imposed by the PCI and bands, at the first annual price captariff filing following the close of the base year in which the new servicewas introduced. Since BPI calculations require a comparison of rates intwo completed base years, new services cannot be brought into the BPI calculationsuntil the second annual tariff filing following the close of the base yearin which they are introduced.28. To introduce a new service into price cap regulation, the revenue weightsand average rates used in calculating the API must be calculated with thenew service included in the price cap basket for the base year that isused as a basis for the upcoming annual filing. The percentage change betweenthe base year average prices (including that of the new service), at theserevenue weights, and the proposed prices (including that of the new service),at these same revenue weights, is multiplied by the value of the BPI toproduce the appropriate API value. This API value will then be comparedto the PCI for compliance with price cap requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Calculations for Restructured Services</ITAG>29. The plan contemplates that restructured services must remain subjectto the cap and band limitations applicable to the basket(s) that containedthose services prior to restructuring. Thus, unlike the introduction ofnew services (which are brought into the various index calculations afteran initial period outside price caps), restructuring requires a simultaneousrecalculation of the API. The plan provides that the API should measurethe change that would result in the total cost of purchasing the bundleof services for which restructuring is proposed. This calculation may requireuse of carrier data and estimation techniques to assign customers of theoriginal service to those services (including the restructured service)that will remain or become available in the cap. VI. Effect on Current Commission Rules and Procedures30. Price cap regulation will result in little change to many of this Commission'sapplicable current rules and policies. This Commission's current policyfavoring geographic toll rate averaging will remain intact, and we willretain the Interim Cost Allocation Manual (ICAM) unless ATandamp;T opts forprice cap regulation. If ATandamp;T elects price caps, we propose to requireATandamp;T to adhere to the cost allocation requirements we have profferedfor the LECs for all of its exogenous adjustments, including access costs.The plan does not disturb current quality of service monitoring procedures,including requirements that ATandamp;T and the Bell Operating Companies filesemi-annual quality of service reports, and the routine scrutiny givento all dominant carriers pursuant to the facilities authorization processconducted under section 214 of the Communications Act. The plan also preservesthe Separations Manual, the USOA, and the joint cost procedures codifiedin Part 32 and Part 64 of this Commission's Rules. In addition, price capregulation leaves undisturbed current market rules designed to foster competitionand prevent discrimination. These rules include open entry, equal access,resale and shared use, interconnection, unbundling of tariff services,non-structural safeguards for joint provision of regulated and nonregulatedactivities, and the Open Network Architecture and Comparably EfficientInterconnection protections against discrimination. With respect to ONAand CEI, although we are open to the use of pricing rules to implementthese policies, we believe that concerns as to discriminatory or anticompetitivepricing of Basic Service Elements will continue to be addressed in thetariff review process. We also propose to retain our existing section 208complaint procedures. Our proposed revisions to our Part 2, Part 61, Part65 and Part 69 Rules follow.VII.
