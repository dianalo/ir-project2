The rating concern, in downgrading about $10 billion ofSears debt securities, cited &quot;continued deterioration&quot; of thecompany's retail operations and a failure of changes inmerchandise strategy to address the problems. Sandamp;P also warnedthat the decline of the retail business could &quot;eventuallyforce a change in the corporate structure&quot; that would &quot;entailadditional bondholder risk.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Institutional holders have been arguing for some time thatChicago-based Sears should be broken up, but its chairman,Edward A. Brennan, has vigorously disagreed. He has insistedfor two years that Sears could revive its retail businessthrough more competitive prices and by adding more namebrands to its traditional private-label lineup. But earningsfor 1990 are expected to fall to their lowest level since1982.   Although Sears has lately concentrated on cutting costs --21,000 non-selling employees at Sears stores are scheduled tolose their jobs by midyear -- Sandamp;P said more drastic steps arerequired. Cost-cutting &quot;doesn't address the problem ofbuilding up the revenue&quot; of the merchandise group, saidJoanne Legomsky, an Sandamp;P vice president.   Moreover, Sandamp;P said, &quot;Cost-cutting measures, whilenecessary to restore profitability to the retail segment,will be difficult to implement . . . when the company mustcope with the impact of an economic recession and a decliningcompetitive position.&quot;   A Sears spokesman said the company &quot;regrets the downgrade&quot;but said the action was &quot;understandable in light of the weakU.S. economy and the company's slower-than-anticipatedprogress in improving the performance of its merchandisebusiness.&quot; However, Sandamp;P noted that Sears has &quot;a sound balancesheet&quot; and a financially strong Allstate insurance unit, hesaid.   Sandamp;P reduced its rating on senior debt of Sears and itsSears Overseas Finance unit to single-A from single-A-plusand its rating on Allstate's claims-paying ability todouble-A-plus from triple-A, reflecting what it called&quot;increased difficulties in the personal-lines market,continued aggressive capitalization and reduced financialflexibility based on the difficulties&quot; of the Sears retailoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
