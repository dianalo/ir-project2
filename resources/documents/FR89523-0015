The amendmentin this document is primarily technical in nature and is needed solelyto update the regulations to include an enabling agreement between thegovernment of Canada and the United States. For these reasons and sincethis rule imposes no additional burdens on the States or other Federalagencies, the FHWA finds good cause to make this regulation final withoutprior notice and opportunity for comments and without a 30-day delay ineffective date under the Administrative Procedure Act. For the same reasons,notice and opportunity for comment are not required under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation because itis not anticipated that such action would result in the receipt of usefulinformation. Accordingly, this final rule is effective as of December 29,1988.Since the changes in this document are primarily technical in nature, theanticipated economic impact, if any, is minimal. Therefore, a full regulatoryevaluation is not required. For the above reasons and under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA certifies that this final rulewill not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that therule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparationof a Federalism Assessment.The regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatoryaction listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The RegulatoryInformation Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and Octoberof each year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this documentcan be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified Agenda.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 383</ITAG>Commercial driver's license documents, Commercial motor vehicles, Highwaysand roads, Motor carriers licensing and testing procedures, and Motor vehiclesafety.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: May 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">R.D.
