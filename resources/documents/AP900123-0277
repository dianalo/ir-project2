The new digs mark a slight departure in image for the publishingand video company built on flesh and fantasy. Going into storagewith other icons of Playboy's racier past will be the Playboy signatop its former skyscraper headquarters on Michigan Avenue.   In another sign of Playboy's times, founder Hugh Hefner skippedthe invitation-only headquarters housewarming party Tuesday night.At 63, the onetime king of the swinging singles is working on hisautobiography and settled in his Los Angeles mansion with hispregnant wife, former Playboy centerfold Kimberley Conrad.   Hefner still owns about 70 percent of the company's stock butdaughter Christie Hefner, Playboy's chairman since November 1988,runs the Chicago-based publishing and video company. She has runPlayboy's day-to-day operations since 1982, when she becamepresident.   Playboy's new headquarters atop a 16-story downtown buildingfronting Lake Michigan are smaller _ 100,000 square feet comparedwith 125,000 in its old building _ but feature a two-story, skylitatrium displaying valuable company-owned artworks and airier officespace.   The new headquarters are less than three blocks from the36-story tower that housed Playboy's corporate offices for 22years. Playboy says the move will save the company $11 million overthe 15-year term of the lease.   The smaller but airier new headquarters, Ms. Hefner said in atelephone interview, ``make a symbolic statement about this companybeing renewed, re-energized and entering another era ofcreativity.''   Playboy is indeed showing renewed vigor, 37 years after HughHefner launched the company's flesh-and-fashion flagship magazinefrom his kitchen table in Chicago with a $600 investment.   Although Playboy magazine's circulation is nowhere near its 1972peak of 7.2 million, it has held at roughly 3.5 million for almostfive years while sales of harder-core men's magazines such asPenthouse and Hustler have fallen.   Under the direction of Ms. Hefner, 37, Playboy has made asuccessful push into home video, retooled its broadcast televisionoperations, increased product licensing and expanded its publishingbusiness into art prints and catalogs.   Ever watchful for new markets, the company moved quickly toexploit the liberalization in Eastern Europe with a Hungarianedition of Playboy magazine that sold out its 95,000-copy printing.A second Hungarian issue is on the stands.   The company blamed restructuring costs for a $3.8 million netloss in the fiscal year ended June 30, which followed twoprofitable years.   Playboy reported a $5 million profit on revenue of $39.3 millionin the first quarter of its current fiscal year and some analystssee growth in Playboy's future.   ``They have an awful lot on their plate and the potential hereis quite significant,'' said analyst David Leibowitz of AmericanSecurities Corp.   Playboy is making the most of its 4,000-piece modern artcollection, selling some works and offering reprints of others,including paintings that originally hung in its now-defunct U.S.key clubs and Chicago mansion.   Among the art on display in the new headquarters is a bronzesculpture by Chicagoan Richard Hunt of Playboy's rabbit-headtrademark, a more discreet corporate welcome mat than thenine-foot-high red neon letters spelling Playboy that still standatop the old headquarters building.   Company spokeswoman Terri Tomcisin said the sign will come downnext month and go into storage along with other memorabilia fromPlayboy's hedonistic past, including Hefner's round bed from theChicago Playboy mansion and a 10-foot replica of the Big Bunny, aprivate DC-10 jetliner that once ferried his moving party betweenChicago and the West Coast.</TEXT></DOC>
