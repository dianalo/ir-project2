 DEST built a well-earned reputation on the strengths of itspopular OCR technology, offering reasonable-quality text scanning at amoderate price.andP;  But since the sudden boom in desktop publishing has madegraphics scanning even more fashionable, DEST's pair of midrange scanners,the flatbed PC Scan 1020 and the edge-feed PC Scan 2020, now offerrespectable graphics in addition to average OCR capabilities.andM;The 2020's unique design makes it the better known of the two models.andP;  Itsspace-saving form lets it rest unobtrusively under a computer monitor,accepting and returning scanned pages through slots on its front.andP;  The onlydisadvantages to this design is that it accepts only single sheets.andP;  Forscanning books and magazines, it's necessary to use the 1020's flatbedplaten.andP;  Both scanners offer optional automatic document feeders for scanningstacks of pages.andM;If you're at all versed in scanners, the 1020 may look remarkably familiar,and for good reason.andP;  It uses the same Canon scanning engien as the popularHewlett-Packard ScanJet.andP;  The DEST units differ from HP's ScanJet insoftware: both DEST scanners use Publish Pac and Text Pac scanning packages.andM;Publish Pac, a Microsoft Windows--based application, furnishes well-heeledtext and graphics scanning.andP;  Text Pac, a memory-resident program that runs inthe background, scans text directly into a word processor running in theforeground, formatting the text to the word processor's specification as itgoes.andM;PC SCAN 1020andM;The PC Scan 1020 is the far more conventional of the two products.andP;  After apainless installation procedure, the unit provides line-art, halftone, and4-bit gray-scale graphics scanning for a total of 16 possible gray tones.andP;  Itscans text with equal aplomb, living up to the DEST standard.andM;With equal ease, the 1020 connects to either an IBM PC, an IBM PS/2, or aMacintosh.andP;  To enable such impressive flexibility, the system includes anadapter module that connects to either a PC or PS/2 interface card ordirectly to the SCSI port of a Macintosh.andP;  The adapter module also serves tohold the text processor card that comes included with the 1020 but that addsoptional OCR capabilities to the less-expensive, graphics-only PC Scan 1000.andM;It's the software that differentiates this scanner, though, and for that DESTincludes two varieties.andP;  Publish PAC is DEST's own Microsoft Windowsapplication, recently upgraded for use with Windows/286 and Windows/386.andP;  Itdeliveres fine-point control over both text and graphics scanning, offeringfour different halftoen patterns and precise control over the scanned area ofa page.andP;  To make selecting the scan area simple, Publish Pac runs alow-resolution scan preview.andP;  Using the preview image, you simply position aWindows frame with a mouse to specify the scanning rectangle.andM;Publish Pac's lack of tools for any serious editing of scanned images is itsonly shortcoming.andP;  For that, you'll need to use the copy of PC PaintbrushPlus supplied to edit files saved in .PCX file format.andM;Publish Pac lets you scan text on a portion of a page, but the sole text fileformat it supports is ASCII.andP;  Text Pac, a 64K memory-resident module alsoincluded with the system, presents an alternative streamlined method of OCRscanning.andP;  Text Pac scans an entire page at a time, running in the backgroundbehind your favorite word processor.andP;  One keystroke combination starts a pagescan, dumping formatted text straight into your current document.andM;The DEST text scanning capacity to automatically recognize typefaces andmatrix-match them with is own pretrained fonts makes it easy to use.andP;  TextPac and the text-scanning portion of Publish Pac recognize 12 differenttypewriter and daisy wheel printer typestyles, 5 laser printer typestyles,and the draft output of 5 popular dot matrix printers.andP;  When fed the AppleLaserWriter's Courier font, supported explicitly by Text Pac, the programinterpreted our sample text in the best DEST tradition, with remarkableaccuracy.andP;  But on the LaserWriter's Franklin Gothics and Times Roman, twotypefaces similar to supported HP LaserJet cartridge fonts, Text Pac had moretrouble.andP;  Text Pac also proved reluctant to switch to a new text size whilereading a page.andP;  Our Courier text sample in four different font point sizestripped it up.andM;When Text Pac encounters an odd typeface or a new text size, it strugglesgamely and at length.andP;  Text Pac labored for more than 14 minutes on our testpage with Courier text over a shaded background.andP;  Its cryptic on-screenmessage &quot;Hard to Read Page Entered&quot; displays all the while but offers noinkling of whether it will succeed or fail.andP;  Since the result was oftenunusable, we would have liked to have known that a lot earlier.andM;These are minor grievances, though.andP;  DEST text scanning is the standard formoderately priced OCR.andM;PC SCAN 2020andM;Of the two scanners, DEST is justifiably more proud of its PC Scan 2020.andO;Despite the 2020's inability to accept other than a single page at a time (anautomatic document feeder is an option), it has some real advantages.andM;For those who already work in a crowded space, the 2020 slips between amonitor and PC system unit without taking any additional desk area.andP;  The 2020doesn't even require the adapter module used by the 1020.andP;  In addition, its8-bit gray-scasle scanning recognizes 256 shades of gray.andP;  The 2020 correctlyinterpreted even the 10 percent gray scale on our test.andP;  That makes it asuperb choice for scanning photographs for desktop publishing.andM;Keep in mind that 8-bit gray-scale files can be huge, though.andP;  The scan ofour gray-scale sample page generated an 8MB file.andM;The 2020 uses the same interface card and Publish Pac and Text Pac softwareas the 1020, so those aspects of its use are identical to the 1020's.andP;  DESTclaims that the 2020 scans at more than twice the speed of the 1020, though.andO;We found an increase of more than 20 percent in OCR scanning with the 2020,but neither scanner compared with the fastest OCR scanners in our survey.andO;For line-art and dithered graphics scanning, the 2020 was somewhat fasterthen the 1020 at 300 dpi.andP;  For gray-scale scanning, it was slightly slower,but with much better results.andM;Speed is not the 2020's claim to fame, though.andP;  Its superior gray-scalescanning and space-saving design really make the PC Scan 2020 stand apartfrom the crowd.andP;  For desktop publishing, that makes it an excellent choice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
