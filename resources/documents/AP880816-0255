Add up all the way-out programs of the Democratic Party. Whatdoes the name of Dukakis sound like to you? More taxes.   At a time when costs are rising, when we are paying more forinsurance, housing, medical care and college tuitions, the liberalDemocrats want to take money out of the pockets of working men andwomen because they think Washington can spend it better.   Now, I know those Democrats like to insist they understand theaverage person. But the average people I know don't want to payhigher taxes. Low taxes create jobs better than any governmentprogram.   In my state, the Reagan-Bush tax cuts have created almostthree-quarter of a million new jobs _ good jobs with brightfutures. And here's one governor from a northeastern state who isnot afraid to give credit for our economic miracle to George Bushand Ronald Reagan.   But the Reagan-Bush recipe of low taxes and economic freedom isnot just working in New Jersey, in Florida or California. Therecipe is working far beyond our borders.   Around the world, people are voting with their feet forcapitalism over communism. Just think for a moment. How many WestGermans climb the Berlin Wall to East Germany _ not one!   How many Malaysians pack up to move to Vietnam? Not one!   And I ask you _ how many Costa Ricans tomorrow morning willstand in line for visas to Nicaragua? _ not one! They would have tobe out of their mind!   And even communist nations are finally realizing that Karl Marxknew about as much about economics as Groucho Marx.   The People's Republic of China is experimenting with freeenterprise. Even the Soviet Union is changing. The year I graduatedcollege, Nikita Khrushchev promised that our children would liveunder communism. Today, history is on our side. We dare hope thatKhrushchev's grandchildren will live under freedom!   Look at the free world.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
