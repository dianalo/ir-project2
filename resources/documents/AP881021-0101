Negotiations are to resume in November in Washington on theremaining U.S. demand that China's commercial launch services,using the Long March rocket, not use unfair pricing, according to aU.S. Embassy statement.   Reagan announced Sept. 9 the conditions for granting exportlicenses for the communist nation to launch the satellites.   After four days of talks, the two countries reached agreement onestablishing safeguards to protect sensitive satellite technologyand on setting China's liability in case of an accident, thestatement said without elaboration.   Next month's talks will focus on launch services, pricing andcapacity as the United States seeks assurances that satelliteexports to China will not disrupt the market, the statement said.   The proposal to allow China to launch U.S.-made satellitescaused a controversy within the Reagan administration and Congress.The Commerce Department reportedly was concerned the exports couldharm the domestic launch industry and some Republican senatorsalleged China's launch prices were artificially low.   But administration sources said the State Department favored theexports so as not to offend Beijing.   Two organizations, both foreign, have applied for licenses toexport U.S.-made satellites to China.   Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of Hughes CommunicationsInternational, has asked the administration to approve launching asatellite for an Australian company known as AUSSAT.   ASIASAT, owned by British and Hong Kong firms, is negotiatingwith Hughes to refurbish a Westar 6 satellite that was launched bythe U.S. shuttle in 1984, failed to reach the proper orbit, and wasrecovered by the shuttle.   Eugene McAllister, assistant secretary of state for economic andbusiness affairs, headed the five-member U.S. team in the talks.The vice minister of aerospace industry, Sun Jiadong, led theChinese side.</TEXT></DOC>
