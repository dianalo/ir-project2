The high-technology planes were voluntarily grounded Friday bythe Minnesota-based Northwest until the engine's manufacturers andthe airline can determine the cause of the problem and correct it,said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen.   Northwest has orders and options for 100 of the planes and plansto make the aircraft the backbone of its domestic fleet. Thetwin-engine planes have a wide body, allowing more cabin room fortheir 150 passengers.   Northwest is the first airline in North America to receive anAirbus A320 jetliner. The airline has direct orders for 25 of thecraft for $1.54 billion. The aircraft are to be delivered over thenext three years.   The airline took delivery of the European-built jets less than amonth ago and placed them in regular passenger service July 1following two weeks of pilot-training flights and Federal AviationAdministration evaluation. The two A320s had been flying routesbetween the Twin Cities, San Diego and Detroit.   The problem with the engines is called a compressor stall andoccurs when the engine is taken from idle and placed into gear forthe initial taxi down the runway, Whalen said. An airflow imbalancecan cause the engine to stutter or stall. Whalen said stalls haveoccurred three times with the two aircraft.   ``There's no problem in flying the planes,'' Whalen said. ``Wewill continue to train crews with the planes while we try to fix theproblem.''   The stalls on the ground pose no threat to passengers but aretime-consuming because each time an engine stalls it must beinspected before being restarted, Whalen said. ``We can't have thatkind of customer service unreliability,'' he said.   The engines are manufactured by CFM International, a jointventure between SNECMA of France and the General Electric Co. of theUnited States. The joint venture has taken one of the engines to itsU.S. facility in Cincinnati for testing. Northwest also is examiningthe engines at its maintenance facility in the Twin Cities.</TEXT></DOC>
