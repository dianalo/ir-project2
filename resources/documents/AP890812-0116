Officials remained concerned that more lightning and highertemperatures could start fires again.   ``It's still looking highly suspicious out there, like there aresome thunderstorms coming in,'' said Marcia Nelson, fireinformation officer for the Payette National Forest to the north.   A 45,000-acre complex of fires that incinerated part of the townof Lowman northeast of Boise two weeks ago was 75 percent containedSaturday, but was burning heavily within fire lines, Buist said. Itcould be completely contained by Monday night, he said.   To the north, another complex of blazes reached 20,380 acres andmade short runs inside its perimeter, although Buist said it couldbe totally contained by Sunday. About 1,200 Army personnel werecalled in last week to help ``backfire'' forest, creating ablackened buffer between the blaze and cabins in the Warm Lake area.   The number of firefighters working statewide dropped from 10,000on Friday to 8,000 Saturday, said Vic Standa of the BoiseInteragency Fire Center, the federal hedquarters for fightingwildfires. Buist said Boise National Forest would keep its 5,100firefighters for now to gain a handle on the blazes.   A 9,700-acre complex that raced toward the old mining town ofWarren for a time was stalled, as firefighters sprayed the flamesto keep smoky debris from being blown into unscorched ground, Buistsaid.   ``We're focusing on the hot spots and wetting down 450 feetinside the fire line because it's still so touchy,'' he said.   Several fires in an 11,000-acre complex were contained bySaturday and almost controlled, Nelson said. The fires had burnedalong the Main Salmon River, which is used heavily by raftingparties during the summer.   Fire crews were demobilizing from a 6,800-acre fire in the NezPerce National Forest in the north-central part of the state.   So far this year, 42,000 fires have destroyed 1.4 million acresin the United States, about half of the 2.8 million acres blackenedby 63,000 blazes in 1988, Standa said.</TEXT></DOC>
