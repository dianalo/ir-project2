His comments were punctuated by rebelbombs that exploded near his news conference.   The series of bombs exploded about five blocks from whereCristiani was speaking to reporters Thursday evening. Cristianijumped, but kept talking, telling everyone ``not to worry.'' Noinjuries were reported.   Cristiani termed ``nonsense'' the guerrillas' call for politicalnegotiations leading to a cease-fire. The rightist government isdemanding a truce first, then talks.   ``Without a cease-fire the guerrillas will use the peace processfor propaganda,'' said Cristiani.   Rebel leaders traveled to Caracas, Venezuela, on Thursday tomeet with President Carlos Andres Perez. But Salvadoran governmentofficials didn't plan to attend the meeting, dashing any hopes oftalks.   Perez, however, said he was in touch with Cristiani's government.   ``I will say the same things to the representatives of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front that I said to theministers of the Cristiani government: We need to look for sinceresolutions,'' Perez said.   Meanwhile, traffic moved normally in San Salvador for the firsttime since Nov. 11, when the offensive that killed more than 1,000people was launched in the capital and several provinces. Many ofthe capital's 1 million residents tried to stock up on food, gasand other necessities.   ``We've been cooking with wood,'' said truck driver IsraelHerrera, standing in line for a fourth day at a natural gasdistributorship with 50 other people.   ``Since I don't have any fuel for the truck I'm spending my daysin line.''   At the Soyapango cemetery east of the city, gravediggers buriedfive bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said theyexpected more work.   Much of the city was blacked out after darkness, and an electriccompany spokesman said damage during the battles left a 70 percentpower outage.   Cristiani said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front hadused the negotiating process as a propaganda tool while it preparedthe largest offensive of the rebels' 10-year-old war againstU.S.-backed governments.   The guerrilla group has said it launched its offensive to provethat it cannot be defeated and that the country cannot have peacewithout accepting the rebels as a political factor.   The guerrillas tried to steal Cristiani's show by setting off atleast five small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away. His newsconference was interrupted shortly after he claimed the armycontrolled the city, but he said ``anybody with a small group ofpeople'' could ``launch terrorism.''   Cristiani was surprised, but maintained his composure. The newsconference was interrupted for 1 minute and 34 seconds, but thenresumed even as helicopters roared overhead, dropping bombs androcketing the slopes of a volcano where rebels were believed to behiding.   Explosions continued to be heard just north of the city into thelate evening.   The news conference was held in an open-air pavillion atmilitary headquarters, which has been attacked numerous timesduring the war that has cost an estimated 71,000 lives.   There was little fighting elsewhere as the country experienced asecond day of relative calm.   ``They tried it and lost,'' said Cristiani of the rebeloffensive. He said the guerrilla group must ``come to its sensesand stop its aggression against the people. Then we can sit down tolook at the few things we can do to facilitate their incorporationinto the democratic process.''   Fighting in the city ended Wednesday morning after 12 U.S. ArmyGreen Berets evacuated a luxury hotel that had been seized byrebels.   The guerrillas renewed a cease-fire proposal made earlier,calling for a negotiations preceeding a truce. The governmentmaintains that a cease-fire should take place before substantivepolitical and territorial discussions take place.   The guerrilla proposal included another clause rejected in thepast that called for the armed forces to be represented at thetalks; the guerrillas say that the army holds the real power.</TEXT></DOC>
