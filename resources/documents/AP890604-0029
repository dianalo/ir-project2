The Associated Press transferred the data for a complete year ofjudge's forms, 1987, onto computers for analysis. More than 20,000pieces of data were included.   The reporting rules contained in the Ethics in Government Act of1978 blur the actual value of the investments and income beingdisclosed. Most entries are reported within wide numerical rangesrather than in exact dollar amounts.   The forms understate assets by exempting some from disclosure,including:   _Any home, which is the largest asset for most Americans.   _Any bank account under $5,000.   _Any asset under $1,000.   _Any car or personal property.   _Any property not held for investment purposes or to produceincome.   In addition, property can be valued at cost, which is oftendecades out of date.   Liabilities exempt from reporting include home mortgages, debtsto relatives and revolving charge accounts with balances below$10,000.   For example, a rental property worth $90,000 and generatingrental income of $10,144 a year would be listed as being worth``N'' and the income would be ``L.'' N stands for $50,001 to$100,000 and L is $5,001 to $15,000.   As the number of items handled this way increases, the overallprecision of the forms decreases.   It is least precise at the high end of the ranges, which stop at``over $250,000'' for assets and ``over $100,000'' for income. A$10 million property would be valued as ``P,'' which simplysignifies more than $250,000. If it brought in income of $1 millionannually, that would be listed as ``H,'' more than $100,000.   Net worth cannot be calculated from these forms. Instead, theforms provide data to calculate a net value for an official'sinvestment portfolio by subtracting reported liabilities fromreported assets.   The process can be confusing, even to judges _ a handful of whomattached complaining notes to their forms. In some cases, where theform was filled out wrong but the intent was clear, minorinterpretation was used by the AP in summarizing a judge'sfinances. In cases where more than one interpretation was possible,the finances were recorded exactly as shown on the form.   The reports examined by the AP were filed in 1988 and cover thejudges' finances for 1987. That is the most recent complete set.Reports are required of all judges who work at least 60 days duringa calendar year; between 17 percent and 20 percent of senior judgesdo not work that much.   Some of the judges filing then have since retired, some areliving elsewhere, and a few have died. Other judges have since goneonto the bench, but their finances are not part of this studybecause they were not required to file for that year.</TEXT></DOC>
