Polhill said he wasshocked when he heard of the brutal treatment of Reed. ``I can'tsay I was maltreated,'' Polhill said.   For the first time, Reed gave graphic details of his days incaptivity. The 57-year-old educator said, ``Our routine wasbreakfast, a cigarette, up on your feet. ... After we came backfrom the toilet, we were allowed to exercise.''   When he was first kidnapped, Reed said, he would just lie aroundnot doing anything but worrying.   ``I was a layabout trying to wonder about this and wonder aboutmy school and wonder about my family and worry about my friends. Isaid if I don't worry about (myself), I'm in trouble. There ain'tgoing to be any Frank Reed. I got up and started doing my pushups.''   He began with just six and worked his way up to a record 103.``It was part of my will.''   With some matches he had, he drew a picture of his 9-year-oldson, Tarek, on the back of the door of his cell so that when hisguards opened the door they couldn't see it. On the ceiling, hedrew a picture of his Syrian-born wife, Fahima, known as Fifi. Hewas admonished for this.   ``This is one of the ways I had to kind of remind me to keepmyself going. But I knew in the final analysis if I didn't keep mylife going there certainly wasn't going to be any Fifi or anyTarek.''   He said American hostage Terry Anderson looked wonderful,physically. He last saw Anderson more than a year ago. Anderson,42, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, wasabducted March 16, 1985.   Reed said fellow captives John McCarthy and Brian Keenan werekept together and were in good physical condition.   ``They've been fortunate. I spent probably two years, 2{ yearsin solitary confinement while they were fortunate to have the twoof them together at all times,'' Reed said. He said McCarthy andKeenan developed ``one of the unique relationships in the historyof human relationships.''   Reed talked with reporters after he joined other former hostagesand their families for a brunch and reunion at a hotel in thisWashington suburb. His two daughters by a previous marriage,Marilyn Langston and Jacqueline Reed, both of Malden, Mass., wereamong those present.   Reed had said he hoped the gathering would focus internationalattention on the plight of the remaining hostages held by Islamicmilitants in Lebanon.   Reed revealed details about McCarthy and Keenan for the firsttime.   ``Both of them physically, in terms of muscle development, areprobably in the best shape they've ever been in in their lives,unlike myself, who kind of in one silent protest, I ended up justexercising by walking,'' Reed said.   He said McCarthy and Keenan have been doing an excessive numberof pushups, situps and other exercise. ``In fact, I looked at Johnthe other day and he looked beautiful. I wished I looked like hedoes,'' Reed said.   He said they had received ``a lot of books, so they're keepingtheir minds going.''   Although Reed said he had been kept for long periods in solitaryconfinement, he had reported earlier that his kidnappers treatedhim well during the last six months of his captivity.   ``It was heaven compared to what happened to us previously,'' hesaid Sunday.   Reed, director of the private Lebanon International School inBeirut, was freed April 30 in Syria, two days after he had lastseen McCarthy.   Keenan, 39, an Irish teacher of English at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. Six days later,McCarthy, a 33-year-old British television journalist, was abducted.   Keenan's two sisters, Brenda Gillham, and Elaine Spence, wereamong those attending Sunday's reunion.   Reed, smiling and singing, arrived with his wife and son and twodaughters. With his arm around Tarek, Reed said he was lookingforward to a fishing trip with his son at Sebago Lake in Maine.   ``I'm going to catch some salmon, we hope,'' he said.   Reed was beaming and cheerful.   ``I'm feeling OK,'' he said. ``I'm a little weak from not havinglived very much, no living muscles.''   Reed's doctors reported Saturday they were pleased with how helooked even though his weight had dropped from about 185 pounds toabout 140. Doctors said their early evaluations were good and theyexpected Reed to remain at the Andrews Air Force Base, Md., medicalcenter probably until the end of the week.   Joining Reed at the reunion, which was organized by No GreaterLove, a humanitarian organization, were:   _Peggy Say sister of Terry Anderson.   _Tom Cicippio, brother of Joseph Cicippio, 59, actingcomptroller at the American University in Beirut, kidnapped Sept.12, 1986.   _Jill Morrell, a friend of McCarthy.</TEXT></DOC>
