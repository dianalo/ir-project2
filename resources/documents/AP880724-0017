(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vigilance is needed if the beauty ofOlympic National Park is to be preserved, the director of theNational Park Service said at the park's 50th birthday party.   ``There are those who suggest that having already establishedthe park lands, their preservation is assured, and there is littlemore to be done with them, for them, to provide for this adequateprotection and maintenance,'' William Penn Mott said Saturday.   But there's ``much to be done if these places are to fulfilltheir heritage,'' he warned the more than 500 people at Saturday'sceremonies.   Mott noted that more than 300 million people annually visit thenation's parks, compared with 16 million visitors in 1938.   ``Our park system continues to grow. And we need to continue togrow,'' to preserve such outdoor areas for future generations, hesaid.   President Franklin Delano Roosevelt voiced those same sentimentsbefore signing the legislation, sponsored by local Congressman MonWallgren, that created the park five decades ago.   ``I think you can count on my help in getting that nationalpark, not only because we need it for us old people and you youngpeople, but for a whole lot of young people who are going to comealong in the next hundred years of America,'' Roosevelt told PortAngeles residents in 1937.   On June 29, 1938, Roosevelt signed a bill setting aside 634,000acres to be preserved as Olympic National Park.   Today, the park is 922,000 acres of glacier-capped mountains,alpine meadows, temperate rain forest and ocean coastline. Thenation's third-most-visited national park, with more than 3 milliona year, Olympic remains one of the wildest.   The non-profit National Parks and Conservation Association, aspart of a nationwide assessment of land-acquisition needs, hasproposed about 180,000 acres be added to further protect importantwatersheds and habitat.   A study of ways to maintain national parks' integrity into the21st century is under way by a task force of Park Service managers,Mott said. Entrance fees, such as those which were imposed lastyear at Olympic National Park, help provide such research funds,along with local resource management, he added.   Along with preserving the parks, officials also need ``tocontinue to explore the cultural and recreational interests ofspecial populations, minorities and international visitors toensure that the parks are truly available for the benefit andenjoyment of all,'' Mott said.   Other issues to be addressed include protection of endangeredspecies, air and water pollution and encroaching developmentoutside the parks, Mott said.   He also called for ``improved cooperation among adjacent landowners and land management agencies'' outside the park, as well asthe academic and scientific communities' expanded involvement withpark affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
