In a letter to the Swiss Bankers' Association, the watchdog agency indicated it will no longer accept the right of Swiss lawyers and accountants, acting as trustees, to open accounts for unidentified clients.    This professional secrecy for Swiss lawyers and accountants has been regarded as the weakness in recent barriers erected by Switzerland to restrict the depositing of questionable funds in Swiss banks.    Since 1977, Swiss banks have followed a voluntary code of conduct based on an agreement with the Swiss National Bank for the &quot;observance of care in accepting funds.&quot; This obliges the opener of an account to identify clients and pledge to refuse to assist them in circumventing their home countries' laws. Offending banks face fines of as much as $6.2 million.    But lawyers and accountants are an exception to the rule, and have the right to open accounts without disclosing their clients' names. They are, however, required to sign a statement saying that they know the name of the client.    The agreement between the Swiss commercial banks and the national bank expires Sept. 30. The national bank, which says that it is not a policeman but responsible for the country's monetary policy, has said it will no longer participate. National Bank President Pierre Languetin has indicated he would like to see the banking commission take a more active role by filling the vacuum left by the central bank.    The commission's letter to the bankers' association is the first official indication that that is what it intends to do.    In reference to a professional code of conduct that the bankers' association is working out to replace the agreement with the national bank that ends in September, the commission wrote: &quot;It is our duty to inform you in time that after the present agreement on care in acceptance of funds runs out, we will require as a basic rule the identification of customers, even those represented by lawyers and accountants acting as trustees.&quot;    The Swiss Bankers' Association is in the process of working out a professional code of conduct to be policed by an independent board to replace the original agreement with the national bank. </TEXT></DOC>
