In a letter to the pontiff, Attorney General Mauricio EduardoColorado said the bishops should be withdrawn for their own good.The letter was released the same day as followers buried six Jesuitpriests who were slain in their home Thursday _ the mostpolitically explosive slayings since Archbishop Oscar Romero wasassassinated in March 1980.   Colorado accused ``certain bishops'' of fomenting the violencethat culminated in the biggest leftist guerrilla offensive of the10-year-old war. Fighting has raged in San Salvador and throughoutthe country since it was launched a week ago.   Colorado did not mention any bishops by name, but it wasbelieved that among those he referred to were Monsignor ArturoRivera Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador, and his auxiliaryarchbishop, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez.   Both are identified with human rights causes and have urged thegovernment to negotiate with the rebel Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front to end the war.   Rivera Damas was appointed archbishop after Romero was slain bya sniper. Right-wing death squads were blamed for his murder.   El Salvador's rightist government censured news of the letterwithin the country. A copy of the letter was provided to TheAssociated Press.   There was no immediate reaction from Catholic leaders here orfrom the Vatican. The pope on Friday decried the killings of thesix priests.   Those murders were denounced in the U.S. Congress, where somemembers threatened to cut aid to El Salvador if the government doesnot bring the killers to justice. Washington has provided $3.5billion in aid over the past decade to successive Salvadorangovernments.   In his letter, Colorado said certain bishops who have``persisted in keeping alive the questionable ideology of the`church of the poor''' are considered responsible for ``much of theviolence that has devastated El Salvador for many years andculminated in the rebel actions of this week.''   He said he would investigate the murders of the priests butadded, ``rather than investigating things which have alreadyhappened, it is a thousand times healthier to avoid them.''   Colorado wrote the letter to the pope on official stationary butsaid he was acting as a Catholic and not a government official.   ``I want to suggest to the dear Father, for the security andsafety and well-being of all the Salvadoran faithful, thewithdrawal, at least temporarily, from Salvadoran territory ofthese bishops,'' he said.   Rebel gunners on Saturday shot down a U.S.-supplied A-37 jetfighter-bomber in the eastern province of San Miguel, according towitnesses and airport officials.   Peter Collins of ABC News was in San Miguel and said he and hiscrew saw the plane stuck by two projectiles, apparently from a50-caliber machine gun fired by guerrillas.   Collins did not see the plane crash, but the air trafficcontroller at the San Miguel airport told two other reporters thatthe pilot ejected and the A-37 crashed.   The rebels, on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, claimed theyhad downed the A-37. The armed forces press committee denied aplane had been shot down. The military said Saturday that 784guerrillas have been killed, 527 wounded 129 captured in theoffensive. It said 208 soldiers have been killed and 627 woundedbut gave no report on civilian deaths.   Fighting slackened Saturday, and thousands of hungry, exhaustedresidents took advantage of the lull to evacuate their homes,carrying small children and packages of belongings.   Some refugees crossed into government-controlled territory at acheckpoint near the northern San Salvador suburb of Mejicanos.   Fighting continued only 800 yards away and flared occasionallyalong the northern and eastern edges of the capital, where therebels held their positions.   Earlier Saturday, hundreds of mourners filed past the caskets ofthe six priests and their two housekeepers who were killed in theirresidence at Jose Simeon Canas Central American University.   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, head of the Society of Jesus inCentral America, said they will be buried in the university chapel``because that was their wish.''   ``They wanted to live and die here. They wanted to die as theleading defenders of justice here did, like Monsignor Romero,''Tojeira said.   Students, fellow religious workers, doctors and otherprofessionals, and members of the faculty staff filed past theclosed, gray caskets, which each with a lilac flower on top.   Among the dead were Ignacio Ellacuria, the univerisity's rectorand one of Central America's leading educators, and IgnacioMartin-Baro, one of the region's leading polling experts. Thebrains of the victims were cut out in a sign of contempt.   University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniformsenter the slain priests' residence just before shooting beganThursday. However, the government denied responsibility and said itwould investigate.   The nation's most prominint leftist politician, Guillermo Ungo,left the country for Panama Saturday after spending a week in theVenezuelan Embassy.   Other leftist politicians, union activists and intellectualswere in hiding, fearing that the killings of the Jesuits were thebeginning of another wave of death squad killings.</TEXT></DOC>
