Steven A. Rosenberg and colleagues at the NationalInstitutes of Health gave genetically altered cells to a29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man suffering frommalignant melanoma, an aggressive and fatal skin tumor. Allconventional treatments have failed to halt the malignantgrowths.</LP><TEXT>   The experiment is the second attempt by Americanresearchers to use gene therapy to fight disease. &quot;I'mrelieved . . . we're under way,&quot; Dr. Rosenberg said in aninterview, adding, &quot;I'm optimistic, but this is really abeginning. Genetherapy is just a tool. This is a firstattempt, but it's not the last.&quot;   Dr. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National CancerInstitute, led a team that included R. Michael Blaese of thecancer institute, and W. French Anderson of the NationalHeart Lung and Blood Institute. Drs. Blaese and Andersonbegan a related gene therapy trial last summer in a childwith an inborn immune deficiency, and reported preliminaryimprovement.   Gene therapy in Dr. Rosenberg's trial aims to kill cancerby arming a patient's own tumor-fighting cells with a potentnatural toxin. Doctors first harvest the tumor-fighting cellsfrom the patient's body, and then implant a gene for thetoxin, called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These gene-splicedcells are bathed in growth factors until they multiply toseveral hundred billion cells, and then they are reinfusedinto the patient. The hope is that the altered cells willflock to the tumor site, and persist in pouring out enoughtoxin to erode the cancer.   Tuesday morning, at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda,Md., doctors hooked up intravenous bottles of a milky lookingfluid containing 100 million of these beefed-up cancerfighting cells. As required by the Food and DrugAdministration, doctors will increase the dose every threedays over the next month, gradually building up to a peakdose of 200 billion to 300 billion cells.   Describing the patients as &quot;resting quietly&quot; after thetreatment, Dr. Rosenberg reported no immediate side effectsof the experiment so far. In practice trials using a markergene, the most serious reaction was fluid retention caused byinterleukin-2, the growth factor used to multiply the cells.Severe fluid buildup can stress the heart and lungs,contributing to a mortality risk of 1%.   TNF causes tumors to dissolve in mice, but it so far hasfailed to help people. Moreover, when given in straightinfusions, it can cause severe wasting of the body. But Dr.Rosenberg hopes that using a cancer-fighting cell to deliverTNF right to the door of the malignant cell will enablescientists to boost doses to levels comparable to therapeuticmouse doses -- without toxic side effects.   Results of yesterday's experiment won't be known for atleast a month or two, Dr. Rosenberg said. He has federalapproval to treat as many as 50 patients -- several of whomnow already have their gene-altered cells multiplying in theincubator.   In addition, he disclosed the team is planning futureexperiments that will implant other genes, including genesfor immune system-boosters such as alpha interferon andinterleukin-2. &quot;The lab is working day and night to developnew treatments&quot; for cancer, Dr. Rosenberg said in aninterview.   First greeted with largely uncritical publicity, Dr.Rosenberg's research later weathered a storm of criticism bymedical skeptics like Charles Moertel, a professor at theMayo Clinic, and litigation by watchdog groups like JeremyRifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends.   Dr. Rosenberg ventured that he hopes this trial &quot;will makea real impact on the patients' cancer.&quot; But he stressed thisis a process still in its infancy. &quot;We're trying to open adoor,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
