LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Concept Development Inc. said it has been granted an option to buy more than one million Pizza Inn Inc. common shares.    Concept said that obtaining the option to buy the shares from F.J. Spillman, Pizza Inn's chairman and president, was a condition of its continued pursuit of a previously announced proposal to acquire the Dallas-based restaurant operator.    Concept, a pizza restaurant franchisee, is offering 1.4 Concept shares and $3 cash for each of Pizza Inn's 3.3 million common shares outstanding. The transaction has an indicated value of about $51.5 million.    Concept said that under the agreement, Mr. Spillman, Pizza Inn's largest shareholder, is free to pursue a leveraged buyout of Pizza Inn provided that a firm financing commitment is obtained. An investor group that includes Mr. Spillman has been trying to take Pizza Inn private for several years, but has had difficulty finding financing for a $38 million offer.    In Dallas, a Pizza Inn spokesman said the company will review the agreement between Concept and Mr. Spillman and Concept's proposal to acquire Pizza Inn. The board is expected to meet later this week to review the proposal, he added.    Pizza Inn shares closed Friday at $11.75, up 62.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. Concept shares closed at $9, up 37.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
