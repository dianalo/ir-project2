On the library's last day, children brought stuffed bearsand flowers for the librarian. Later, residents who hadn'theard the news pounded on the locked wooden door of thebuilding.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They couldn't believe we were really closing,&quot; says BettyHamilton, the librarian. &quot;To a child, the library was alwaysthere. Then suddenly something is missing from their life.It's like when someone dies, there's a little empty spacethere.&quot;   The Poca library was one of three small branches closedlast year in Putnam County, a bedroom community forCharleston and Huntington. Why? Each branch cost about$15,000 a year to operate -- more than the county couldafford.   Finally, the small libraries begged enough money to reopenpart-time this week. But after making do for eight months,the people of the three communities offer a dark glimpse oflife without libraries -- and a warning to other areas of thecountry, both urban and rural, where many of the nation's15,000 public libraries are struggling to survive.   Libraries face soaring costs for books, periodicals andcomputers just as their budgets are being squeezed bycash-strapped local governments. Few libraries have beenclosed completely, but officials are cutting hours, trimmingstaffs, slashing book and periodical budgets and leavingbroken boilers and other problems unfixed.   The New York City library system has cut hours by 10%since 1988 and faces a new 8% budget cut. In Brooklyn lastweek, demonstrators draped library doors with black cloth toprotest layoffs and service cuts, including programsaffecting children. The Los Angeles system has been under ahiring freeze since last year that has left the librarieswith about 110 positions unfilled, or 10% of the staff. InDade County, Fla., library officials have to cut back by 3%,and that &quot;may mean shutting smaller branches,&quot; a spokesmansays.   In Philadelphia, the public library has canceled ordersfor 20,000 new books and has delayed reopening three branchesthat are undergoing capital improvements. &quot;I just got areport that says we still have toilet paper but don't havepaper towels,&quot; says Elliot Shelkrot, president and directorof the Free Library of Philadelphia. &quot;It gets down tobasics.&quot;   Throughout the U.S., libraries are pleading for money. Ina special election, residents in Rockland County, N.Y., wentto the polls last week to vote on one issue: Whether toincrease property taxes to raise $245,000 annually for publiclibraries in Suffern and Sloatsburg. The tax passed, 336 to142.   The cutbacks come despite growing concern that illiteracyrates are rising and that workers don't have sufficientreading skills. The retrenchment is particularly painful nowbecause library use traditionally goes up during recessions,when people flock to branches to seek out newspaper want-adsand books become an important source of free entertainment.   Public libraries are especially vulnerable in a slumpingeconomy. Libraries usually don't charge fees and instead getmost of their money from local governments. But today, manycities and counties, struggling with budget problems, arecutting services across the board. Libraries, considered lessessential than services such as police and fire protection,often get the crumbs of a shrinking economic pie.   No help is coming from Washington. The Department ofEducation increased its allotment for public libraries to$132 million in 1990 from $74.5 million in 1981, an increasethat library advocates say fails to keep up with inflation.And President Bush's new budget recommends a 73% cut, to $35million.   The library cutbacks have hit especially hard in ruralAmerica, where branches play a larger civic role than theirurban counterparts. They often serve as cultural centers,social dens and auxiliaries to local grade schools. Yetpublic support is difficult to muster in the hardscrabblecounties, where anti-tax fever runs high and where, accordingto Peggy Bias, director of the Putnam County, W.Va., librarysystem, many adults &quot;think a library's a luxury.&quot; She adds,&quot;They didn't have it when they were growing up and don't seewhy they need it.&quot;   Few states need healthy libraries more than West Virginia,which is ranked 49th in the nation in state literacy ratings,according to U.S. Census figures. In fact, West Virginia hasone of the nation's most innovative public library systems,thanks to the flamboyant state library commissioner, FredericJ. Glazer. During his 19-year tenure, Mr. Glazer has morethan doubled the number of public libraries and installed amodel computer network system with the help of shrewdmarketing and irrepressible showmanship.   Testifying before a committee of state legislators in1972, Mr. Glazer gave each member a five-cent pack of LifeSavers. Because West Virginia was spending four cents percapita on library services at the time, Mr. Glazer told thelawmakers, &quot;This pack costs more than we're spending forlibrary service, and that's shameful.&quot;   His efforts paid off. West Virginia now spends $2.96 ofstate money per person on library service, compared with thenational average of $1.37 -- but when spending from localgovernments is included, West Virginia is ranked near thebottom among states. Under Mr. Glazer's stewardship, thenumber of libraries in the state has risen to 185 from 90. Inthe early 1980s, a computer network was installed in 120libraries, connecting remote mountainous communities withphone and microwave links, to tell library users where theycan find books in the system. Satellite dishes are being putup in about 100 libraries this year, paid for by a privatedonation.   State funding, however, has been stagnant for severalyears, and makes up only 38% of the money needed to run thelibraries. For all his progress, Mr. Glazer can't overcomeeconomic reality. &quot;Uncle Sam can bail out all thesebusinesses, but he can't bail out a library,&quot; Mr. Glazerlaments. &quot;Libraries are just as important as Chrysler, and ifthey're uncertain, let them build cars with workers who can'tread.&quot;   Even his best efforts couldn't prevent five branches fromclosing last year, including those in the small towns ofPoca, Eleanor and Buffalo in Putnam County, which has a totalpopulation of 42,597. Holding 5,000 books each, theseso-called &quot;outpost&quot; branches are squat prefabricated woodenstructures that had been rolled into town. The buildings camewithout windows, but now each has one -- only because thelibraries used part of a small grant for books to do theconstruction.   When the Poca branch was in full swing, a financialadviser helped residents with tax forms. Copier and faxmachines drew crowds. Rhododendrons bloomed in front, and Ms.Hamilton, the librarian, notarized wills, read stories topreschool children and allowed overdue book borrowers to payfines with cans of food, which were donated to a soupkitchen. But the problems were obvious, too: The library'sWorld Book is dated 1979.   Before the libraries got their reprieve, Putnam officialstried to keep the branches open with three proposed taxlevies, but all failed. The most recent, in November,received 58.4% of the vote, just shy of the 60% needed forpassage.   The closings cut deep wounds, not all of which will behealed by the limited reopenings. At Buffalo High School,entire classes depended on the library for research projects;after the building closed, students had to be bused tolibraries in other towns. &quot;It hurts, particularly with thebetter students,&quot; says Bill Sanders, the principal. &quot;In asmall town, anytime you lose something, you lose part of yourlife.&quot;   In Eleanor, six-year-old Traci Flynn would walk to thelibrary and check out Garfield books. In the summer, she wentfor story hours, when the librarian read poems and fairytales, led sing-alongs and served cookies and Kool-Aid. Butall that ended last June when the library closed. The maincounty library is 10 miles away in Hurricane, and Traci'sparents, who both work, rarely had time to take her there.Traci's school doesn't have a library, so she read few books.&quot;We have books, but she doesn't like to read the same onesover again,&quot; says her mother, Carla Flynn.   In Poca, it used to take Carol Carroll three minutes todrive to the library, where her two children would check outJudy Blume books. With the library closed, it took 20 minutesto reach the main library, so trips were reduced. &quot;I was sonaive, I never thought a library could close,&quot; she says.&quot;It's like a church packing up and hitting the road. It'sjust supposed to be there.&quot;   In January, the county library commission asked for$40,000 from the Putman County Commission and the PutnamCounty School Board to reopen the branches. The school board,which already gives $40,000 a year, turned down the request,suggesting the branches use volunteers instead of paidlibrarians.   &quot;We have a lot of justifiable causes, and we can't fundall of them,&quot; says Sam Sentelle, the school superintendent.Noting that all of Putnam's high schools and middle schoolshave libraries, he adds, &quot;We need more books for our ownlibraries.&quot; In addition, he says, &quot;The electorate has turneddown tax money for the library, and if the schools gave theirmoney to the library, it would circumvent popular will.&quot;   The county, however, agreed to put up $20,000, in additionto the $71,000 it already spends. That was enough to reopenthe branches for 30 hours a week starting this week. OnMonday, Putnam library officials cut a red ribbon on thestaircase leading to the front door and children from a localelementary school brought Ms. Hamilton flowers and aheart-shaped balloon inscribed with the message, &quot;You'respecial.&quot; But the joy could be short-lived: If more moneyisn't found, even the part-time hours will be cut in half.   Other libraries, like the one in Peterstown (pop. 640), apoor tobacco-farming community on the Virginia border, get byon a shoestring and a prayer. Nestled amid oak and mapletrees in the Appalachian Mountain Range, the carousel-shapedwooden library has been used for wedding receptions, slumberparties, scout meetings and political forums.   Students at the local grade school, which lacks a bookcollection of its own, come frequently. On a recent day, thedoors fly open and 25 fourth graders noisily drop off books,then rush for the stacks to find Hardy Boys, the BlackStallion and Nancy Drew. When the children leave, librarianAnnette Rule-Place and her three volunteers grab the returnedvolumes and scurry to the shelves. They have a half-hour toreplace about 100 books before the next class arrives.   The library almost closed in the mid-1980s. Monroe Countyhad cut back its funding after money from federal revenuesharing dried up (a problem that also hit Putnam, wherefederal revenue sharing once accounted for 16% of thecounty's budget). Ms. Rule-Place laid off her one paidassistant, cut magazine subscriptions and opened the libraryonly three days a week. Even though the county has nobookstores, support for its two public libraries has beendifficult to gain. The libraries twice asked voters toapprove a property tax levy, but lost both times.   So Ms. Rule-Place's library has hung on through privatedonations and grants, which, together with public money, makeup its $24,240 budget. Two years ago, it landed an additional$25,000 state grant, which has allowed the library to stayopen six days a week.   Ms. Rule-Place and her volunteers also scrape up nickelsand dimes. On the checkout desk sits a large tin can forcontributions. So far today: 37 cents. The library onceraised a few dollars when Ms. Rule-Place dressed up somechildren as Little Bo Peep, gave them a tin cup and sent themto a mall. &quot;I went as Mother Goose,&quot; she says proudly.   A native West Virginian, Ms. Rule-Place has used her ownmoney for crayons, glue, pencils and other supplies. She isalso the judge for the grade school spelling bee andcoordinator for the county's Girl Scouts. Her annual salaryis $11,000. &quot;I want these kids to have the same educationalopportunities as kids from New York or Pennsylvania, and I'mgoing to do my damnedest to make sure they do,&quot; she says.   Her 14-year career as a librarian has a storybook twist.She met her third husband here. He was standing in adultnonfiction, and it was love at first sight. They married twoyears later. &quot;All good things,&quot; Ms. Rule-Place says, &quot;happenin a library.&quot;   ---                    Libraries' Lament                                                                                                          States ranked by all money spent per capital for publiclibraries in 1989, preliminary data in dollars                                                                                                          New York            $29.48   Dist. of Columbia    29.46   Maryland             24.45   Alaska               23.64   Ohio                 23.34   Connecticut          22.10   New Jersey           21.16   Wyoming              19.83   Washington           19.81   Illinois             19.25   Massachusetts        19.18   Minnesota            18.62   Colorado             18.01   Indiana              17.95   Hawaii               17.23   Wisconsin            16.53   Virginia             16.29   California           15.89   Kansas               15.85   Oregon               14.74   Arizona              14.53   New Hampshire        14.46   Michigan             13.83   Missouri             13.37   Nebraska             13.16   South Dakota         13.09   Maine                12.66   Vermont              12.37   Florida              11.93   Iowa                 11.85   Rhode Island         11.71   Louisiana            11.53   New Mexico           11.34   Pennsylvania         10.99   North Carolina       10.55   Oklahoma             10.24   Georgia              10.06   Idaho                 9.84   Nevada                9.65   Texas                 8.94   South Carolina        8.72   Delaware              8.22   Alabama               8.13   North Dakota          8.01   Tennessee             7.70   Montana               7.56   West Virginia         7.46   Kentucky              7.04   Mississippi           6.58   Arkansas              5.98                                                                                                          Source: National Center for Education Statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
