The virus, which turned up in a version of Aldus Corp.'sFreeHand drawing program, also got into a computer network at thecompany's headquarters here, Aldus said.   No programs for sale to the public were infected and the virushas been eradicated, Aldus spokeswoman Laury Bryant said Thursday.   ``Software companies can't always protect themselves from stuffcoming in, but we can say unequivocally that we do everything wecan to make sure they don't go out,'' Ms. Bryant said.   Viruses are computer programs, created by programmers as jokesor acts of vandalism, that secretly attach themselves to otherprograms. The virus can then spread from computer to computer whenoperators share infected software.   At their most benign, viruses merely flash a message on acomputer screen. At their worst, they can destroy informationstored in computer memories or cripple a machine.   Two viruses all but paralyzed the work of hundreds of studentsand faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, officialssaid Thursday.   Last month, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer was convictedof planting a virus in his employer's computer system in the firstsuch conviction in the nation. Two days after the employee wasfired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000 company records.   Aldus officials said their new virus, dubbed ``nVir,'' hasremained dormant so far, attaching itself to other programs.   ``We don't know why, we don't know what invokes this virus,''Dauber said. ``With some of them, you have to launch the program acertain number of times,'' for the virus to activate.   Aldus said it does not know where the virus originated.   Ms. Bryant said the infection did not do the company anyfinancial damage because no retail copies were involved and that itwould not affect plans to ship the updated version of FreeHandlater this year.   The first infection occurred in March, when a ``peace message''turned up in an earlier version of FreeHand. The message did noharm to computers, flashing a brief message on computer screensbefore dying out.   The incident shocked computer experts, who until then hadthought viruses could be avoided if users didn't freely exchangesoftware, but only used off-the-shelf programs. The infectionforced Aldus to recall or rework thousands of packages of the newsoftware.   Aldus and other major software producers have since adoptedrigorous testing methods, including the use of ``vaccine'' programsdesigned to seek out viruses. Aldus also has isolated from possiblecontamination the machines that reproduce its software, Ms. Bryantsaid.   Still, the virus was found in versions of the updated FreeHandprogram that had been sent to specific users to be tested beforethe program was offered for sale.   Aldus said it had shipped infected disks to a dozen businessesand users around the country. One of those users discovered thevirus and notified the company.   Aldus said the virus also was found in its quality-assurancecomputer network.   ``nVir'' eluded a number of vaccines, Ms. Dauber said. It wasfinally revealed by a new detection program, which was not in usewhen the test versions were shipped out.</TEXT></DOC>
