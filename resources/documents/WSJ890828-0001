Unless the economy plunges into a recession, prices will rise at a 4% to 5% annual rate next year, many manufacturing executives and economists agree. Moreover, there's growing concern that a boost in the economy could trigger higher inflation next spring.    Prompting that spiral would be the Federal Reserve Board's recent moves to lower interest rates. That could accelerate the economy enough to cause price increases above and beyond the annual raises companies seek at the beginning of the year to cover anticipated labor and other cost increases.    For now, demand has eased enough to halt skyrocketing prices of steel, paper, plastics, chemicals and other basic commodities that earlier this year threatened to ratchet the nation's inflation rate up a notch, into the 6% to 7% area. &quot;We're over the hump on pricing pressure,&quot; says John Nyhuis, manager of purchasing for Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc., a Fond du Lac, Wis., machine tool producer.    Oil prices also have dropped over the past three months, cutting prices at the gas pump and reducing costs of making some chemicals. In addition, the dollar has climbed enough this year to slow the rise in prices of imported goods and force some domestic producers to moderate their own pricing to stay competitive.    Producer prices in July declined for the second consecutive month, the Labor Department reported recently. Still, wholesale prices last month were 5% higher than a year earlier. And there's little evidence the Fed has made any headway in its goal of reducing the underlying inflation rate.    &quot;You would expect prices to soften quicker than they have,&quot; says H. James Murdoch, director of purchases for Reliance Electric Co.    In fact, the nation's inflation rate has been remarkably stable in recent years, if the effects of oil price fluctuations are eliminated. The consumer price index at midyear, excluding energy, was 4.8% higher than a year earlier. From the beginning of 1982 to the end of 1988, that index rose an average of 4.2% annually. The smallest increase was 3.8% during 1986 and largest was last year's 4.7%.    Even optimists say it would take more than the current slowdown to drop inflation out of that range. Maury Harris, economist with PaineWebber, who considers himself an optimist, says the consumer price index will rise at a 4% annual rate over the next 18 months.    &quot;We're not yet at full employment,&quot; he says, &quot;and I expect the dollar to hold up relatively well because of an inflow of foreign investment.&quot; Thus, he says, wages and benefits won't soar, nor will prices of imported goods. And he expects the economy to grow at a modest 2% pace, avoiding pressure on productive capacity.    Most economists foresee prices rising a little faster than that. The consensus of 50 leading economists polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an economic newsletter, calls for a 4.6% rise in consumer prices next year. One dissenter, A. Gary Shilling, contends the economy &quot;in all likelihood is now in a recession&quot; that will wring most inflation out of the economy by late next year.    Beneath the modest change in the overall inflation figures are violent crosscurrents. The big winners of the previous two years, commodity producers, will see profits trimmed over the next 12 months as price increases give way to discounting.    On the other hand, lower commodity prices will alleviate a profit pinch for some companies that turn basic materials into consumer goods and industrial equipment. &quot;Copper has dropped 30%, aluminum pretty close to that and brass is beginning to fall,&quot; says Leo W. Ladehoff, chairman and chief executive of Amcast Industrial Corp., Dayton, Ohio, which buys a lot of all three. Prices for some of Amcast's products are slipping, too, he says, but not as rapidly, and profit margins are recovering. The maker of valves and fittings, auto parts and aerospace products reported a 46% earnings drop for the May 28 third quarter, mainly because of the difficulty in passing through soaring materials costs.    Employment costs, however, have been rising more rapidly in recent quarters, replacing commodities as the primary engine of inflation. Should the economy pick up briskly early next year, those labor costs, combined with higher capacity utilization, could trigger inflation at a rate of well over 5%. Also, the downturn in prices for steel, plastic resins, aluminum and copper won't immediately alleviate all materials cost pressures, because the huge commodity price increases of late 1988 and early 1989 haven't worked their way through the system yet.    The auto makers illustrate the upward price pressure lurking behind the recent weakening in wholesale prices. To unload excess stock of 1989 cars, producers have been cutting prices, through cash rebates, dealer allowances and other promotions. Lower auto prices helped reduce the July wholesale price index. However, when 1990 model cars appear in the showrooms this fall, sticker prices will be 4% to 9% higher than for the 1989s. Some of that increase will cover costs of air bags and other optional equipment that will be standard on the 1990s.    Just how much more buyers pay for comparably equipped 1990 autos depends on how well they sell. If sales perk up enough for auto makers and dealers to curtail promotions, buyers could pay 20% more for some models.    A 4% to 5% inflation rate, while upsetting to many economists, is comfortable for many businesses. They've gotten used to it, which may be one reason it's so durable. Few companies want to squeeze all the profit away from their suppliers, even when they have a bit more muscle because business is slowing. And they're even more loath to deny wage and salary increases to their own employees, much less cut compensation, unless the business is in imminent danger of going under.    Wages and benefits rose a disturbing 5.4% in the 12 months ended June 30, the Labor Department reported. Some economists think that overstates the longer-term compensation rise, but many foresee a 1990 rise of 4.5%.    For commodity producers, the recent price decline stems primarily from lower plant utilization rates as the economy's growth slows and new capacity comes on line. Only six months ago, producers of a wide range of metals, paper products, plastics and chemicals were running all-out, and still had customers on allocation.    There's hardly anything that scarce now, and commodity prices are &quot;spotty,&quot; producers say. For instance, prices of high-quality coated papers used in commercial printing are firm, say industry officials. But an attempt to raise prices on uncoated papers used by office copiers failed, and there's paper available at discounts of 2% or so. Likewise, there's &quot;a little deal-making going on&quot; with linerboard, which is used to make corrugated boxes.    However, bleached board and coated natural kraft, two premium packaging materials, are moving up about 5%. And there's talk of another attempt to raise linerboard prices $30 a ton, or about 7%, this fall. Several earlier attempts failed.    So far, commodity prices aren't cascading downward, partly because demand is strong across much of the world. Also, the rising dollar's impact on U.S. commodity prices is mitigated by a plethora of import restrictions on everything from steel, bearings and machine tools to clothing. </TEXT></DOC>
