It is too hard. There are no guarantees that despite the valuable time spent you are going to make it at all.    The truth is Olympians in America are real amateurs and compete in their sport for the simple love of it.    I will leave it to others to figure out how much money one loses in endorsements when one loses at the Olympics. Perhaps a better subject to investigate would be why such an ambitious and talented person as Debi Thomas will benefit personally from her bronze medal. It's going to take a few years, but she will realize that the Olympic struggle is actually more important than the Olympic win.    When the future roads she travels get bumpy, she will be well sustained not by her skating skills, but also by the character she obtained from the Olympic experience.    Carl J. Robie III   Sarasota, Fla.   ---   Re Frederick C. Klein's article regarding the construction of the Olympic speedskating Oval in Calgary (Leisure andamp; Arts page, Feb. 16): He refers to the &quot;roof&quot; of the Oval as being &quot;made up of intersecting arches of pre-cast concrete.&quot; In fact, the Oval is a unique pre-cast concrete structure, while the roof is an equally unique system developed by our company, P.G. Bell Architectural Porcelain.    To our knowledge it is the only roof of its kind in the world and is a spectacular use of our product, as envisioned by the architects, Graham McCourt of Calgary. The finished roof is made up of more than 12,000 triangular porcelain enamel panels, forming a complex geometric pattern that follows the line created by the current concrete structure.    Enameling is the art of fusing colored glass to steel. We are extremely proud of our product and of North America's only indoor speedskating facility, and we fully concur with the praise it has received from the Olympic athletes.
