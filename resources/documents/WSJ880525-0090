(What do you call yours?)&quot;   It's a not-too-subtle swipe by one of Lufkin's independent banks at the impersonal, big-city banking that arrived here after First RepublicBank Corp. and First City Bancorp. of Texas bought the town's two largest banks. &quot;We're building this bank on the attitude&quot; of the big banks, says Jack Gorden, a former First Republic banker who is the president of Peoples National Bank here. Peoples National purchased the ads.    As some of Texas' largest banks are collapsing, some little banks are benefiting. Three of the six banks now here got their start after Dallas-based First RepublicBank and Houston-based First City came to town. Local businessmen started them because they didn't like out-of-town bankers telling them how to run their businesses and they wanted to preserve friendly, country-style banking.    &quot;I found the chain banks impersonal,&quot; says Buford Abeldt, who owns two Lufkin pharmacies and switched his business from First City to Peoples.    All three of the new banks -- Peoples, Community Bank and Angelina National Bank -- are being deluged with deposits from customers fleeing the big banks as federal regulators moved in to &quot;rescue&quot; the large banks from insolvency. The little banks also are serving borrowers cut loose by the big banks. At Texas National Bank of Lufkin, another independent, B.H. McVicker, the senior chairman, notes &quot;a steady increase&quot; in loans and deposits.    The day First RepublicBank Dallas said it was seeking a federal bailout, Community Bank opened 40 new accounts, at least four times the usual number. &quot;We were opening accounts like you wouldn't imagine,&quot; says Mark Swan, Community's president. Citizens State Bank in Corrigan, about 26 miles south of here, has even made a loan to a First RepublicBank Lufkin director whose credit was restricted recently at the Lufkin bank.    The big bankers' credibility with the locals was lost when, after promising that little would change, they instituted service charges, long loan applications, elaborate credit checks and other big-city banking practices. First City also brought in new managers from the big city and, like other multibank holding companies, told the Lufkin bank to ship up to 40% of its profits to the parent as a dividend. First Republic retained local management but also siphoned off profits to Dallas.    &quot;Although it was implied that we'd take a hands-off approach, that really wasn't the case,&quot; admits Gerald R. Williams, a former executive vice president of First City who negotiated many of its takeovers.    The big banks' approach sparked a culture clash in Lufkin, where bank-board meetings had once involved lots of chit-chat over a meal. Now, a former First City Lufkin director is embroiled in a bitter lawsuit with the bank. E.L. &quot;Sonny&quot; Kurth Jr., a 77-year-old descendant of one of the Lufkin bank's founders, contends that the bank's new owners booted him off the board after he stormed out of a Lufkin board meeting with Houston officials. He says he wanted them to address rumors of a pending federal bailout of First City, but &quot;they didn't tell us a damn thing.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Branch Bullying: Small Texas Towns Are the Latest Victims of Big Banks' Crisis --- Locals' Credit Gets Cut Off as Dallas and Houston Drain Away the Deposits --- No Money for Chicken Feed&quot; -- WSJ May 25, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
