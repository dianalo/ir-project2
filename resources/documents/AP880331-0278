Once that goal is achieved, MCI plans to reduce its debt andlater begin buying back the 16 percent stake in the company held byInternational Business Machines Corp., said spokesman BernardGoodrich.   The company, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier,wants to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 67 percent to around40 percent over the next four years, Goodrich said.   ``At that point, we would look at the market and see if the nextstep is to buy back the IBM stock,'' he said. ``We're talking threeto four years before we would consider that and then we'd have toconsider market conditions.''   Goodrich confirmed a report in Thursday's editions of The WallStreet Journal, in which MCI officials outlined the company'sfuture plans.   Financial pressures on the company have eased now that it hasfinished building its digital network. It also has added 800service, operator services and direct-dial service virtuallyworldwide to match the offerings of industry leader AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   MCI acquired IBM's share of Satellite Business Systems in 1986in exchange for 47 million shares of MCI stock. Under theagreement, IBM cannot acquire more than 30 percent of MCI's stockwithout the company's approval.   With a stock repurchase, MCI could assure its independence andincrease its earnings per share, Goodrich said.   MCI ended 1987 with earnings of $88 million, or 31 cents pershare, on revenues of $3.94 billion. The company's capital andother expenses exceeded its cash flow by $200 million last year.   IBM had no comment on MCI's stock-repurchase plans.   A company achieves positive cash flow when its net profit plusdepreciation is greater than its expenditures on dividends andinvestment in plant and equipment. MCI does not pay dividends.</TEXT></DOC>
