 Inside, severalslightly disheveled executives sit around a conference table, waiting.andP;  Somestare silently out the window while others pace or make nervous small talk.andO;Suddenly, a young assistant bursts into the room carrying a pile of reports.andM;&quot;The survey results are in,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;It doesn't look good, folks.&quot;andP;  Theexecutives crowd around, grabbing copies of the report.andP;  They turn to thepage headlined &quot;Survey Results,&quot; and take their places around the conferencetable.andM;&quot;We've apparently got a lot of work ahead of us,&quot; says the executive at thehead of the table, as she loosens her tie.andP;  &quot;Our approval rating has gone tohell.&quot;andM;This could be a scene from a high-stakes political campaign in which afailing candidate's top-level advisers fret over the latest disappointingpreelection poll results.andP;  But these days, it could just as easily be a viewfrom inside a large information systems organization.andP;  Increasingly, centralIS organizations, anxious to prove their worth, are polling theirconstituents--information systems users--in search of an answer to one mainquestion: &quot;How is IS doing?&quot;andM;&quot;Not good enough,&quot; is the answer that often comes back from users.andP;  Evenwhere system response times and total system uptimes, the classic ISperformance yard-sticks, may be at all-time highs, IS often finds that usersthink it's doing a lousy job.andP;  Instead of cowering in self pity, IS iswelcoming such criticism.andP;  And it's taking steps to improve the perception ofIS and its alignment with organizational goals.andM;Measuring and reporting user satisfaction levels can be a boon to IS.andP;  Butthe move also can backfire.andP;  Unexpectedly low scores can mean headaches forIS if they fall into the hands of unsympathetic top corporate executives.andO;Surveys can degenerate into little more than popularity contests whilepushing user expectations out of control if they aren't linked to morecomprehensive efforts to measure IS costs and pin down accountability.andP;  Thatcan do more harm than good by diverting IS attention from important long-termcorporate goals in the interests of improving next month's survey scores.andM;Regardless of the potential pitfalls, the number of IS organizations focusingon user satisfaction measurement seems to be growing rapidly.andP;  Nearly 40% oflarge IS shops regularly survey users on the subject, according to a recentstudy by The Conference Board Inc., a New York City-based association ofleading companies.andP;  That's twice the amount of survey work such shops weredoing, according to a study conducted two years ago by Hammer andamp; Co., ISconsultants in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;Many users say these surveys have thepotential to change behavior on both sides,&quot; says Conference Board's GeorgeNewman.andP;  End users begin to think IS cares while IS starts to regard them ascustomers, he explains.andM;Those kinds of changes are more important than ever.andP;  As IS continues toevolve from a cloistered, back room support function into a vital competitivetool integrated into the fabric of most companies' day-to-day business, therelationship between IS and users is becoming critical.andP;  So critical, infact, that it is often the only support function in a company measuringworkers' satisfaction with its performance.andP;  In some rare cases, financedepartments are starting to gauge employee satisfaction--but no where near tothe degree that IS is measuring itself.andM;Users are expecting more from information systems, thanks in part to theirown hands-on experience with technologies such as personal computers.andP;  And,as more and more of the information systems function is dispersed to businessunits, users are wielding more clout over IS.andM;&quot;IS types are realizing they have to worry about users and theirperceptions,&quot; says Kay Lewis Redditt, a principal with CogniTech ServicesCorp., a consulting firm in Easton, Conn.andP;  &quot;It has a lot to do with all thechanges IS is going through right now and the fact that, to a large degree,the way you are perceived is reality.&quot;andM;The changes she's referring to are only too well known to IS managers.andP;  Thebreakup of central IS, the outsourcing of technology, the farming out of ISactivities and the advent of new organizational structures such asindependent business units are causing systems managers to rethink their rolein their organizations.andP;  (See &quot;Careers In Crisis,&quot; Aug. 15, 1989, p.12.)andM;Self-Perception and Reality DifferandM;There is often a large gap between user perception of IS and IS' self-image.andO;&quot;The classic case is the IS guy who says, 'Our system is up 99.5% of thetime, but a certain class of our users hates us,'&quot; says Robert Morrison,director of the Prism Project, a joint venture between Hammer andamp; Co. and theIndex Group Inc., also a Cambridge, Mass.-based IS consulting firm.andP;  &quot;They[IS] are facing the fact that users and managers tend to remember the thingsthat have gone wrong, and they remember them for a long time.&quot;andM;Recent university studies point to wide disparities in the perceptions users,upper management and IS executives have of IS performance.andP;  In a Universityof Pittsburgh study, 80% of the IS managers complained that they haddifficulty convincing top management of the potential strategic impact of IS.andO;One major reason was that top management doubted IS could deliver what itpromised.andP;  Some information systems managers even acknowledge the problem.andM;&quot;A lot of [IS] people have been deluding themselves that they've been doing agood job, when really the way they are perceived by users and uppermanagement is a different story,&quot; says Warren L. Harkness, director ofinformation systems at Bose Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andP;  Two years ago, soonafter joining Bose, Harkness instituted semiannual user satisfaction surveys.andO;The surveys recently led Harkness to attempt to improve communications byappointing a member of his staff to act as a liaison with each userorganization in the company.andM;A study by the University of North Carolina found that while IS managersbelieve they are very concerned with user problems, users themselves are muchless convinced.andP;  &quot;Since 1982 or so, we've heard a lot about strategicsystems, but not many people are having much success implementing them.andP;  Wewanted to know why,&quot; says Kathy Brittain White, who helped conduct the UNCstudy.andP;  &quot;It seems that what is lacking is a common view between users and IS.andO;What is needed is a linking mechanism, something to bring IS and userstogether to deal with rapid change.&quot;andM;Nowhere are the changes affecting IS more apparent than at Eastman Kodak Co.andO;The Rochester, N.Y., company a year ago instituted user satisfaction surveysas part of a comprehensive effort to measure IS effectiveness.andP;  Suchmeasurement was critical at a time when Kodak was consolidating its datacenter operations while spinning most application development out to businessunits.andP;  &quot;We felt it was essential to find out what users are thinking andwhat their perceptions are,&quot; says Henry Pfendt, Kodak's director ofinformation technology services.andP;  Kodak will continue to survey users, thoughnow they will be judging somebody else's IS performance--that of IBM, whichhas contracted with Kodak to operate the film maker's data centers.andM;Kodak started out by working with users to identify 19 critical products andservices provided by IS.andP;  They included electronic mail, mainframe computingand voice mail.andP;  Then Kodak, with the help of Ridgefield, Conn., consultantPeter Pappas, put together a three-page survey that asked users to rate theirsatisfaction with each service on a scale of 1 to 5.andP;  Users also were askedto say which service they had used in the last four months and to specify thesingle action that would be most productive in improving the service orproduct.andP;  Kodak plans to survey different sets of 700 or so users five timesper year.andM;So far, Kodak's IS group has learned plenty from the surveys it hasconducted.andP;  Going into the first survey, its goal was a satisfaction score of80%--the threshold for being considered a world-class operation in Pfendt'seyes.andP;  Users, instead, gave the film maker's IS performance grades of 60%.andO;The reaction was swift--IS began to follow up on areas of perceived weaknessby contacting users and, in some cases, holding focus groups.andP;  Already thescores have started to improve.andM;While the trend toward measuring user satisfaction is clear, techniques varywildly.andP;  &quot;The thing we noticed was that the range of approaches to this wasbreathtaking,&quot; says Newman of The Conference Board.andP;  He has seen writtensurveys that fit easily on a single page.andP;  He has also seen 28-page monstersthat come complete with six pages of instructions.andP;  Some companies stickexclusively with written surveys, while others prefer telephone polls oraugment written surveys with targeted focus groups led by outsideconsultants.andM;Equally varied is how organizations react to findings.andP;  Some companies treatsurveys only as advisory tools.andP;  But others take them very seriously, tyingthe salaries and bonuses of IS managers directly to results, in some cases.andO;Some companies limit survey follow-up to sending periodic reports to seniormanagement.andP;  An increasing number of them, however, link surveys to othermeasures of IS performance and report them on line, as part of executiveinformation systems.andM;Experts say that, as a rule, the best user satisfaction measurementapproaches are part of comprehensive IS performance measurement andmanagement programs.andP;  They also say that IS executives should be willing toshare results of user satisfaction surveys with users themselves and withupper management.andP;  Furthermore, they should follow up with action plans aimedat fixing user-perceived deficiencies.andM;What Not To SurveyandM;Too often, however, surveys are done on a one-time-only basis.andP;  And,frequently, they are designed primarily to bolster IS' standing with uppermanagement.andP;  Such efforts are doomed to fail, says M. Victor Janulaitis,president of the Los Angeles-based consulting firm Positive Support ReviewInc.andP;  &quot;These surveys cannot be done in a vacuum,&quot; the consultant warns.andP;  &quot;Youhave to start with some basic agreements between IS and users about whatexpected service levels and performance are.andP;  Otherwise it's just a waste oftime.&quot;andM;Such agreement is sometimes hard to reach because IS teams are uncomfortableputting their performance on the line to be judged by users.andP;  &quot;Most IS peoplesimply aren't interested in people judging their work.andP;  There are oftenpsychological hurdles to overcome in setting up and making use of thesesurveys,&quot; says Richard S. Mathews, president of Mathews andamp; Co.andP;  His Stamford,Conn., consulting firm has been designing user satisfaction surveys for ISorganizations in the United States for 15 years and is just starting to dosome in Europe.andP;  &quot;IS people often cause change for others but don't likechange in their own environment.&quot;andM;When Kodak IS workers learned a year ago that users would be evaluating theirperformance, their first reaction was panic.andP;  That gave way to a morepositive approach after planners of Kodak's IS evaluation system explainedtwo critical points: first, the user satisfaction survey results were justone of several criteria on which IS performance would be judged.andP;  Second, theintroduction of detailed IS performance measurements was inevitable as thecompany evaluated which IS functions to spin out and which to retain inhouse.andP;  &quot;As soon as [IS] people understood that they had to start running theinternal IS function as a business and that they needed to generate acustomer orientation and focus, they started to perceive the surveys as atool rather than a threat,&quot; says Pfendt.andM;By linking surveys to other IS performance measurement tools and toservice-level agreements, experts say, IS can position itself as a partnerwith its users rather than as just a back-office expense item.andP;  In such anarrangement, managers in the end user departments have an obligation todefine expected levels of IS services and the price they are willing to payfor them.andP;  Doing so makes such managers realize that they have a vestedinterest in the success of IS.andM;Service-Level AgreementsandM;One of the first large IS shops to link user satisfaction surveys toservice-level agreements was GTE Telephone Operations and its IS unit inIrving, Texas, which started the practice in 1983.andP;  Now the company seeks tolink user satisfaction surveys to other measures of IS performance and toimprove its reporting of survey results.andP;  GTE Telops is developing both a newsurvey designed to gauge management satisfaction with IS and an on-lineexecutive information system to report survey results to management.andM;&quot;It is our intent to use perception measurements to link our customers'feelings about how well we are performing to the actual performancemeasurements that are more objective,&quot; says Bob Faulkner, director of qualityassurance compliance for GTE Information Management.andP;  &quot;We will use thisanalysis to identify and close gaps between user perceptions and actualperformance.&quot;andM;GTE Telops and other companies are finding that attempts to reconcile userperceptions with more technical measures of IS performance often result inorganizational changes designed to improve communications between IS andusers.andP;  GTE Telops, for example, recently created a user satisfaction workgroup.andP;  Made up of 10 representatives from IS and user constituencies, thegroup focuses on service areas where user and management perceptions don'tmatch and works on improving user perceptions.andM;Often, those kinds of efforts require marketing and communications skills asmuch as technical solutions.andP;  At Bose, the stereo components maker, surveyresults showed users were unhappy that IS failed to respond to all userrequests for PCs.andP;  Through follow-up interviews with users, IS workersexplained that the company's policy was that it could not afford to provide aPC to everyone.andP;  At the same time, IS took the survey results to uppermanagement, which gave it additional resources that spurred improvements inPC installation and maintenance.andM;The middleman-marketing role played by Bose's IS group is one that most ISmanagers attempting to follow up on survey findings are going to have toassume, experts say.andP;  Although schooled technically, such managers are goingto have to learn some organizational tricks if they are to succeed inexplaining management policies to end users and represent end-user concernsto top executives.andM;Must IS Do Marketing?andM;Not everybody likes playing go-betwee, of course.andP;  Many organizations employuser satisfaction surveys only on a limited basis or not at all, preferringto focus on other methods of measuring IS performance.andP;  At Digital EquipmentCorp., for example, a new IS performance project tries to document IScontributions to bottom-line financial performance, surveyign users on a verylimited, project-by-project basis.andP;  &quot;What we really want to know is: How doesthe IT investment affect the productivity of the corporation?&quot; says IS seniorgroup manager Marty Sack.andM;Basing judgments about IS performance largely on user satisfaction isillusory, Sack argues.andP;  Users often have as much difficulty as IS does indetermining which services are effective and which aren't.andP;  &quot;What you end upwith is two people [users and IS] playing the same game,&quot; Sack says, &quot;butthey don't know how to keep score.&quot;andM;Users do, indeed, know how to score important aspects of IS performance,argue devotees of measuring user satisfaction.andP;  &quot;If you want to measure cost,that's fine.andP;  But how about quality?andP;  And how do you measure effectiveness?&quot;andO;asks Jack Levine, senior vice president of business development at SecurityPacific Automation Co. (SPAC), the IS subsidiary of Security Pacific NationalBank in Los Angeles.andP;  &quot;Users have to be in on that definition and measurementfrom the beginning.&quot;andM;Often, however, IS reluctance to consider user satisfaction is not basedprimarily on the conviction that there's a better way to measure ISperformance.andP;  It's based on fear.andP;  &quot;Many people in IS are simply afraid that,by beginning to survey users, they're opening a big can of worms that theywon't be able to control,&quot; says Prism's Morrison.andP;  &quot;They're afraid that someusers will always be negative.andP;  And, worse, they're afraid that seniormanagement will tend to scrutinize IS more and begin to ask questions aboutthe value of IS across the board.&quot;andM;But smart IS managers know those questions are inevitable as the IS functionbecomes more visible.andP;  &quot;Upper management knows if there's userdissatisfaction out there,&quot; adds CogniTech's Redditt.andP;  &quot;Basically, the smartCIO [chief information officer] knows that the potential benefit ofmonitoring user satisfaction and doing something to improve it is worth therisk.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
