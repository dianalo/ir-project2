Bishop also reported a net loss of $481,000 on sales of $2.6 million for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. The loss included a charge of $53,000 for settlement costs related to the pending litigation. It also included a one-time charge of $525,000 for a three-year employment agreement with its former chief executive officer and an inventory write-down of $80,000.    For the full year, Bishop had a net loss of $538,000 on sales of $11.8 million.    In a statement, Bishop, a maker of printed circuit design products, said it faced a maturing market for its products &quot;due to the technological advances in printed circuit board design by means of computer-aided design.&quot;    Bishop executives couldn't be reached, and the company's statement didn't describe the suits. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in June, however, Bishop said it was named a defendant in three suits filed by former employees.    A suit filed in October 1985 alleges wrongful termination and seeks $7 million in damages. A suit filed in November 1985 against the company, an officer and an employee alleges age discrimination and seeks damages of $5 million. A third suit, against the company, two officers and an employee, alleges violation of age and sex discrimination statutes and seeks damages of $1 million.    In the SEC filing, Bishop said it was insured for actual damages but was not insured for punitive damages.    Bishop shares closed Wednesday in national over-the-counter trading at $1.875, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
