Brady said todaythat Congress should look at reducing or eliminating taxes ondividends as a means of discouraging debt-financed corporatetakeovers.   He acknowledged, however, that efforts to cut the federal budgetdeficit made that an unlikely prospect.   Brady opposed eliminating the tax breaks on so-called junk bondsthat are financing the multibillion-dollar takeovers. But he saidthe government may have no other choice if financiers do not ``putthe same intensity and effort into evaluating where we are going sthey have into taking us there.''   The Treasury secretary, testifying before the Senate FinanceCommittee, said eliminating the tax deductions for interest paid onjunk bonds ``would simply increase the cost of capital for Americanacquirers by effectively raising their interest rates ....''   ``The net effect would be a competitive disadvantage for U.S.corporations,'' he said.   Instead, Brady urged Congress to look at effectively reducingtaxes on dividends. He said West Germany, Italy, Australia and NewZealand give shareholders credit for taxes paid by corporationsbefore dividends are distributed.   ``I recognize that at this juncture revenue considerations limitour ability to provide fundamental relief from double taxation ofcorporate income,'' on both the corporations and their stockholders,Brady said.   The Treasury secretary appeared to contradict a statement earlierby Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder that thedebt-financed takeovers, known as leveraged buyouts or LBOs, do notpose a problem for the U.S. economy.   Brady has called the use of junk bonds in corporate takeovers a``dangerous destabilizing element ... largely dedicated tounproductive purposes,'' and he expanded on that view today.   ``I have a growing feeling that we are headed in the wrongdirection when so much of our young talent and the nation'sfinancial resources are aimed at financial engineering while therest of the world is laying the foundation for the future,'' he said.   Brady said the total value of leveraged buyouts has increasedfrom around $11 billion in the five-year period from 1978 to 1983 tomore than $160 billion in the past five years, including $60 billionin 1988 alone.   A contributing factor in the proliferation of leveraged buyouts,he said, is the up-front fees collected by banks, underwriters andfund managers in the transactions.   At the same time, the companies acquired through the leveragedbuyouts often lack the cash flow to keep up with the interestpayments on junk bonds.   ``Sadly, these same parties may have relatively little, if any,investment in the long-term success of the new enterprise,'' Bradysaid. ``Given this arrangement, it may very well be that the neteffect of LBOs is a financial snipe hunt, where the new long-terminvestors, flashlight in hand, are left holding the bag.''   In contrast, the SEC's Ruder said on ``CBS This Morning'' earliertoday that he thought LBOs ``will increase ownership by managementand will make us a more productive country.''   ``I mean by that that after these buyouts, the managers of thedivisions typically will be allowed to run the divisions withouthaving to be overseen by the top management of the largeconglomerate, and they may be very much more efficient in theirmanagement when they're on their own,'' he said.   President Bush, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and atleast a half-dozen congressional committees all are worried aboutcorporate America's debt binge of takeovers financed withhigh-interest junk bonds.   The new administration already is under pressure to come up withproposals to curb the buyouts.   Some economists worry that during a recession, highly leveragedcompanies would not have enough cash flow to keep up their interestpayments to junk bond holders and other creditors and might pullother companies down with them.   ``One could imagine that a company would get caught with a highlevel of debt during the period before they've had a chance torefinance,'' Ruder said. ``But that would only be one company or twocompanies and would not be a threat to the economy.''   Since last fall Brady has had a team at the Treasury Departmentlooking at whether the tax laws are encouraging companies to financetheir expansions through debt rather than stock equity. The groupalso has tried to determine corporate vulnerability in the event ofan economic downturn.   The Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means committees lastweek issued a report showing that corporate debt has climbed by $613billion in the past five years while ownership equity has declinedby $313 billion.   The report also said that the ratio of debt to equity innon-financial corporations has climbed from 30 percent to 46 percentfrom 1981 to 1987.   Fears about the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies wereheightened last September when Revco D.S. Inc., the Cleveland-baseddrug store chain, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings afterdefaulting on $700 million in bonds following a buyout.   Despite the continuing booming economy, bankruptcies continue toclimb _ from 51 large companies defaulting on $11 billion in debt in1984 to 87 companies defaulting on $21.4 billion in 1987.   ``I think there's an appetite here to do something,'' Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Meanspanel, told reporters last week. ``Something really should be done,particularly when we're seeing the junk bond abuse.''   Bush two weeks ago ruled out direct government action to curtailthe new tide of takeovers _ most of them financed by borrowing hugeamounts of money against the assets of the company being acquiredthrough high-yield junk bonds.   But he left open the possibility of changing the way the tax lawstreat stock dividends and the deductibility of interest payments ondebt used to finance takeovers.   ``There are things you can do in the tax laws,'' he said. ``Ifthere are abuses of our tax laws ... the whole tax law will bereviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''   Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, also has urged Congress to take anew look at how the tax laws encourage corporate debt and discourageequity.</TEXT></DOC>
