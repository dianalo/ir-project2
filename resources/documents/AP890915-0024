The shrinkage appeared more frequently in Alzheimer's patientsand in people who were later diagnosed with the disease than inother people, researchers reported.   If further research confirms the result, scanning for theabnormality may be useful as one step in diagnosing the disease,study co-author Mony DeLeon said Thursday.   The work is reported in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a Britishmedical journal, by DeLeon and colleagues at the New York UniversityMedical Center.   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that attacks thebrain and impairs thinking, memory and behavior. It affects anestimated 2.5 million American adults. No cause or cure is known.   Researchers used a procedure involving computerized tomography,an X-ray technique commonly called CT scanning, to study a portionof the brain called the hippocampus.   They examined 76 patients with mild to severe Alzheimer's, 27with minimal age-related memory changes, and 72 normal volunteers,all with an average age in their early 70's.   Shrinkage in the hippocampus appeared in 87 percent of theAlzheimer's group and 70 percent of those with mild memoryimpairment, compared to 22 percent of the normal volunteers.   Researchers also followed 20 patients with mild memory impairmentand 28 healthy people of similar ages. By three years later, 11 ofthe subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Ten of them had shownshrinkage in the hippocampus in the initial examination.   Of the 37 people not diagnosed with Alzheimer's by three yearslater, only seven had shown the hippocampus abnormality.   Robert Terry of the University of California in San Diego saidresults suggest the abnormality may help in diagnosis ofAlzheimer's, but because it also appears in normal people it cannotbe used by itself.   DeLeon said the people who were not diagnosed with Alzheimer'swithin three years may be at risk for developing outward symptomslater.</TEXT></DOC>
