While it is true that many companies no longer maintain elaborate archives, we find an increased interest in preserving the very real human drama of corporate evolution. Rather than &quot;sweeping their history out the door,&quot; more and more corporations are waking up to the fact that to forget how and why they did things is to abandon an invaluable asset.    In your article, you note that a company's history often just walks out the door when key employees retire or move on to other jobs. The firms we have worked with have all been determined to avoid this form of corporate amnesia. Although not all of our clients have extensive archives, they have all recognized the value of having a corporate oral history program.    Corporate archives are filled with facts and figures but tell little of the hows and whys behind key corporate decisions. Oral history techniques -- extensive interviews with high-level personnel, past and present -- can supply the true story of how decisions were made, as well as capture an organization's style and spirit.    Ideally, a corporation should maintain a full-scale archival program. However, when a company has neither the time nor the resources to do so, an on-going oral history program is a cost-effective way to ensure that the lessons from the past are not forgotten.
