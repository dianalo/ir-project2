Althoughthe FDIC lacks complete information regarding these offerings, based ondocumentation reviewed and information received from the general public,when they first appeared they generally were treated as deposits by theissuing institutions. The instruments have usually had the following characteristics:A general creditor status with no default provisions, use of the term ``deposit,''a statement that the issuance is (or the issuer believes that it is) adeposit, payment of deposit insurance assessments, and inclusion of theliability as a deposit on the issuer's report of condition (``Call Report'').In such cases, the FDIC has taken the position that the issuances are depositsand, therefore, insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. In fact,such an issuance could be styled a certificate of deposit but has not been,apparently because of the desire to attract sources which normally buy``securities'' and not ``certificates of deposit.'' In addition to issuancesconsidered to be deposits, there also have been instruments issued by banks(sometimes by the same issuer) that have not been considered by the issuerto be deposits (sometimes called ``bank notes''). The basic provisionsof both types of issuances appear to have been the same, except that the``non-deposit'' type may or may not specifically use the term ``deposit''and may have no statement regarding the issuance's status as a deposit.(Of course, in these latter cases, no deposit insurance assessments arepaid, and the liability is shown as something other than a deposit on thebank's Call Report.) The ``non-deposit'' type of issuance recently appearsto have gained prominence in the market. There are a number of difficulties with this situation. First, there isa substantial danger of confusion. If the FDIC insures one liability whichlooks exactly like another uninsured liability except for its name andperhaps a simple statement as to whether the liability is a deposit, theconsumer may be confused as to what type of liability he has purchased.We would note in that regard that many of these deposits may be brokendown into small denominations; purchases are not necessarily in large denominations.Although there are, of course, arguments that purchasers of large instrumentsdo not care about deposit insurance coverage, in the FDIC's experiencesuch a lack of concern disappears when there is a bank failure. Moreover,in addition to deposit insurance, the status of the instruments is importantto large and small depositors, and therefore to the FDIC, in states thatprovide a preference for depositors in the event a bank is closed and liquidated.Further, the FDIC believes that many of the liabilities are already withinthe definition of ``deposit,'' and the FDIC would be required to insurethem in the event of a bank failure. Yet these liabilities currently arenot being assessed and, consequently, the issuers of such obligations arenot paying their appropriate share into the deposit insurance fund. Although the FDIC believes that many of the transactions in question fallwithin section 3(<T3>1)</T3>(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>1</T3>)(1), the FDIC has decided to use its power under section 3(<T3>1</T3>)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>1</T3>)(5), to determine that certain liabilities, including depositnotes, are deposits by general usage. As required, the FDIC has consultedthe Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System. Their comments and views concerning this proposed regulationhave been considered in formulating the proposal. As indicated above, this clarification of the definition of ``deposit''has been occasioned by the issuance of instruments such as ``deposit notes,''but such issuances do not represent the only transactions which are nowfulfilling the traditional function of deposits. Banking has changed substantiallysince the creation of the FDIC in 1933, and the FDIC is aware that banksare accepting liabilities other than traditional deposits for the purposeof obtaining funds to use in the banking business. This situation is largelya by-product of deregulation, with its increased competition, and of themany alternatives to depositing funds with banks which currently existin the marketplace. The FDIC believes that the liabilities named in theproposed regulation, that is, notes, bonds, acknowledgements of advance,and similar liabilities which are undertaken as a means of obtaining funds,constitute deposits by general usage. As reported by the <T3>Wall Street Journal</T3>, ``The market in these so-called deposit notes,which didn't exist before 1985, has mushroomed to almost $20 billion inless than two years and by year end could reach $30 billion, or 30% ofall banking company bonds and notes expected to be issued this year * **.'' Winkler, <T3>Credit Gap Between Banks, Parent Firms Helps Create Big Market in DepositNotes, </T3>Wall St. J., Mar. 1, 1988, at 42, col. 4-6, 4. The currenttrend is likely to continue, and deposit notes are likely to become ``anincreasingly important bank funding source.'' Griep, <T3>Deposit Note Issues Rise, Standard andamp; Poor's Credit Week, </T3>Oct.5, 1987, at 14. As stated previously, there appears to be little distinctionin the marketplace currently among the issuance calling themselves depositsand those not. Although a deposit for reserve requirement purposes is not necessarilythe same as a deposit for insurance and assessment purposes, most of theliabilities covered in the proposal are already deposits for reserve purposes(although they may be otherwise exempted from reserve requirements). <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, 12 CFR 204.2(f)(3), 204.9(a)(1). The FDIC has usedthe Federal Reserve's Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of DepositoryInstitutions, 12 CFR Part 204, as a beginning point for the proposed regulation,largely because of the banking industry's familiarity with that regulation.The proposed regulation is not in any way intended to parallel RegulationD directly, however. The FDIC has, in addition, made accommodation fortransactions which create deposits for insurance and assessment purposesbut do not for reserve purposes; for instance, dealer reserves are depositsfor the former but not the latter. In addition, we have allowed for itemswhich are not classified as deposits under the Call Report instructionsor in general practice; for instance, due bills are not currently depositsand do not become deposits under the proposal. The structure of the proposal begins by determining that any liabilityof an insured bank on a promissory note, bond, acknowledgement of advance,or similar obligation issued or undertaken as a means of obtaining fundsis a deposit. The regulation then specifies a series of exceptions to thebroad pronouncement. This regulatory definition of deposit is supplementary and complementaryto that in the statute. Any transaction which is a deposit under the statutoryprovisions continues to be a deposit and is not excluded by any of theregulatory provisions. Likewise, no transaction explicitly exempted fromthe assessment base by the statute itself is intended to be covered. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>12 U.S.C. 1817(a)(4) (deposits accumulated to pay personalloans). The proposed regulation would state that a liability of a bankon a promissory note, bond, acknowledgement of advance, or similar liabilityundertaken as a means of obtaining funds is a deposit. If a liability fallswithin the stated class, it may not be a deposit under the regulation ifit is within one of the enumerated exemptions. For example, a bank whichissues a cashier's check to purchase business equipment must consider thatcashier's check to be a deposit; the cashier's check is a deposit under12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>1</T3>) and is not exempted under proposed andSection; 354.2(a)(9). Further,there are many transactions in which there is no note, bond, acknowledgementof advance, or similar obligation involved; such transactions do not constitutedeposits under this proposed regulation. Such transactions may occur inthe context of conditional or endorser's liabilities, dividends declaredbut not yet paid, accounts payable, and overdrawn ``due from'' accounts.Several of the exemptions relate to ``government'' transactions and certaininterbank transactions. The first three exemptions, at proposed andSection;354.2(a) (1), (2), and (3), relate, respectively, to transactions witha Federal Reserve Bank, a bank's borrowing of federal funds for one businessday or under a continuing contract, and a borrowing by a bank from anotherdepository institution of immediately available funds maturing in morethan one business day. These funds have not traditionally been consideredto the deposits and continue to be considered to be borrowings for purposesof deposit insurance and assessments. Proposed andSection; 354.2(a)(4) specifiesthat the Treasury Tax and Loan Transaction in which the bank puts fundscollected on behalf of the Department of Treasury into a note (``Note Option'')does not constitute a deposit for insurance or assessment purposes. ProposedandSection; 354.2(a)(5) similarly would exempt advances either from a FederalHome Loan Bank or from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.Several traditional banking transactions would be exempted from the definitionof deposit. The proposal would exempt repurchase agreements (andSection;354.2(a)(6)), banker's acceptances (andSection; 354.2(a)(8)), short positions(andSection; 354.2(a)(12)), due bills (andSection; 354.2(a)(13)), and retentionsof risk in assets or pools of assets sold to third parties (andSection; 354.2(a)(10)).It should be noted that the proposal does not purport to cover matterssuch as the advisability of issuing thee or other liabilities mentionednot proper disclosures when so doing. Banks issuing such obligations shouldconsider the adoption of disclosure guidelines to ensure compliance withthe anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws; this proposaldoes not preclude consideration of formal disclosure policy by the bankregulatory agencies. Any of the liabilities which are issued and representedby mortgage-backed bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations, or othersimilar obligations backed by mortgages or other assets also would be exempted(andSection; 354.2(a)(11)). Finally, the proposed regulation, at andSection;354.2(a)(14), would exempt any such liabilities which represent the liabilityof an insured branch of a foreign bank to any other office, branch, agency,or wholly-owned subsidiary of the same foreign bank. This provision wouldbe included here simply because such liabilities are neither insurablenor assessable. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 330.1(d)(3), 346.22. More generally, the proposed regulation would allow one of the coveredliabilities to be exempted if the liability is subordinated to the claimsof all creditors, including depositors as well as general creditors (andSection;354.2(a)(7)). It would provide an exemption for one of the designated liabilitieswhen it is issued as a part of a transaction solely for the purchase orlease of business premises, equipment, supplies, or business services forthe bank (andSection; 354.2(a)(9)). Comment is specifically requested onwhether such liabilities issued to third parties not directly involvedin the transaction should be included in the exemption. The FDIC is interested in any comments on the proposal. Particularly, theFDIC invites comments on whether or not any of the liabilities definedas deposits under this regulation should or should not be considered deposits,as well as whether liabilities not covered should be. In general, we arealso interested in comments concerning the usage of any such instruments.The FDIC anticipates that any final regulation on this subject would beeffective immediately and would be applicable to all offerings in existenceon the publication of the regulation in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comment is specifically invited, however, onwhether the effective date should be delayed in its application to anyspecific transactions.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For instances, proposed andSection; 354.2(a)(7) requiresthat a liability be subordinated to all creditors, not just depositors,in order to be excluded from the deposit base. The FDIC is interested inwhether (and in what quantity) there are existing liabilities which aresubordinated only to depositors. Further, since some notes subordinatedto depositors may have been incldued in the computation of an institution'scapital and the proposal would count such liabilities and others not subordinatedto all creditors as deposits, the FDIC is interested in receiving commenton whether such practices present significant operational questions. Finally,comment is invited on whether a phase-in of the regulation's applicabilityto liabilities subordinated only to depositors is warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>This action is being taken because the FDIC believes that the liabilitiesconcerned are in fact deposits by general usage and that they should beassessed. The deposit insurance scheme depends on the fact that assessmentsare paid on total deposits held by insured banks, not just on depositsof less than $100,000 or on deposits which will be paid in full. The FDICbelieves that the great prevalence of the offerings, which are for allpractical purposes identical but which in some cases are called depositsand in others not, is highly misleading and detrimental to the bankingsystem in general. Further, the FDIC believes that if a bank issuing theseinstruments fails, there is a strong likelihood that the FDIC will be required,because a predominance of bank failures are handled by purchase and assumptiontransactions in which all general liabilities are assumed, to accord theseinstruments the benefit of insurance coverage whether or not they currentlyare defined as deposits. This action is based primarily on 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>l</T3>)(5) which allows for the inclusion of deposit liabilities notspecifically enumerated in 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>l</T3>) (1) through (4). In addition, 12 U.S.C. 1819 (Tenth) providesa basis for this action. Since all insured banks will be affected by thisregulation, all insured banks, whether they be large or small, will havethe same responsibilities under the regulation and will pay assessmentsat the same assessment rate, although banks with more deposits will ofcourse pay greater assessements. It is the FDIC's belief, however, thatcurrently most small banks are not issuing deposit notes, although theymay be issuing others of the liabilities proposed to be covered by thisregulation. The regulation has no specific reporting requirements, otherthan those reporting requirements which are required for every deposit.Specifically, the Call Report will be affected, but it will not includeliabilities not already covered by existing portions of the report. Nonew skills or other activities will be required by the bank. Since thequestion of which liabilities constitute deposits for assessment purposesis uniform for insured banks, there is no possibility for a tiered approach,because payment is a fixed percentage of total deposits. Accordingly, becausesmaller banks have fewer total deposits, they pay less in deposit insuranceassessments. In addition, pursuant to the FDIC's statement of policy on the draftingof regulations, and to the foregoing discussion, it has been determinedthat a cost-benefit analysis, including a small bank impact statement isnot required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 354 </ITAG>Assessments, Banks, banking, Bank deposit insurance. For the reasons stated in this notice, and pursuant to the FDIC's authorityunder section 3(<T3>l</T3>)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>l</T3>)(5), the FDIC proposes to add 12 CFR Pat 354 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 354_DEPOSIT LIABILITIES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">354.1 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">354.2 Deposits by general usage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 12 U.S.C. 1813, 1819 (Tenth). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 354.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>Section 3(<T3>l</T3>) (1) through (4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C.1813(<T3>l</T3>) (1) through (4), defines certain transactions to be deposits.In addition, section 3(<T3>l</T3>)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 1813(<T3>l</T3>)(5), gives the FDIC the power, after consultation with the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Comptroller of the Currency,to find and prescribe by regulation that other obligations are depositliabilities by general usage. This part finds and prescribes certain liabilities,unless excepted, to be deposits. Such liabilities must be direct obligationsof the insured bank itself; obligations of a subsidiary or other affiliatedentity of the insured bank are not deposits. Any deposit liability underthis part exists as a supplement or complement to the statutory definitions,and no exceptions to this part can override the fact that a liability isa deposit under the statutory definitions. In addition, liabilities whichare not deposits or are excluded from the assessment base because of aspecific statutory exclusion, such as international banking facility deposits(<T3>see</T3> 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>l</T3>)(5)(B)), are not covered by this part. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 354.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Deposits by general usage. </ITAG>The following direct obligations of an insured bank are deposits by generalusage for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1813(<T3>l</T3>)(5): (a) Any liability of the insured bank on any promissory note, bond, acknowledgementof advance, or similar obligation that is issued or undertaken by the insuredbank as a means of obtaining funds, except any obligation that: (1) Is issued or undertaken and held for the account of a Federal ReserveBank, which arises from a borrowing of proceeds from a Federal ReserveBank or a transfer of deposit credit in a Federal Reserve Bank, or whichrepresents other transactions by the insured bank with a Federal ReserveBank; (2) Involves the insured bank's borrowing (federal funds purchased) ofimmediately available funds for one business day or under a continuingcontract (as those terms are used in the Instructions to the Report ofCondition), regardless of the nature of the contract or collateral, ifany; (3) Represents a borrowing by the insured bank for another depository institutionof immediately available funds which matures in more than one businessday (as those terms are used in the Instructions to the Report of Condition);(4) Arises from election of the Note Option by the insured bank actingas a Treasury tax and loan depository pursuant to regulations of the Departmentof the Treasury; (5) Arises from an advance of funds to the insured bank from a FederalHome Loan Bank or from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation;(6) Arises from a transfer of direct obligations of another entity thatthe insured bank is obligated to repurchase; (7) Is subordinated to the claims of creditors, including depositors andgeneral creditors; (8) Arises from the creation by the insured bank of its banker's acceptance;(9) Is issued as part of a transaction solely for the purchase or leaseof the bank's own business premises, equipment, supplies, or business services;(10) Arises from the retention by the insured bank of the risk in an assetor pool of assets sold to third parties;(11) Is represented by mortgage-backed bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations,and other similar obligations backed by mortgages or other assets whichare issued or undertaken by the insured bank; (12) Arises from an obligation to purchase assets sold by the insured bankwhich it does not own (commonly known as ``short positions'');(13) Arises from obligations resulting when the insured bank undertakesto sell or deliver securities to, or purchase securities for the accountof, any customer (including another depository institution) and involvingeither the receipt of funds by the bank, regardless of the use of the proceeds,or a debit to the account of the customer before the securities are delivered(commonly known as ``due bills''); or (14) Is a liability of a United States branch of a foreign bank, the depositsof which are insured in accordance with the provisions of the Federal DepositInsurance Act, to another office, branch, agency, or wholly owned subsidiaryof the same foreign bank.
