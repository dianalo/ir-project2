Santa Barbara Savings is one of several of California'sbiggest Sandamp;Ls that have failed recently, or are in danger offailing, because of a second wave of problems brought on byill-fated diversification either outside the state or outsidetraditional home-loan lending.</LP><TEXT>   Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association of Beverly Hills andValley Federal Savings andamp; Loan of Van Nuys, for instance,currently are insolvent but haven't yet been seized; otherthrifts, such as Far West Savings andamp; Loan of Newport Beach, aunit of Far West Financial Corp. and Great American Bank ofSan Diego, have lost most of their tangible capital and arestruggling to survive.   In an earlier round of problems, some of the state'sbiggest thrifts, including Lincoln Savings of Irvine andGibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, were taken over byregulators.   In contrast, about four or five other giant Californiathrifts are thriving, partly because their troubledcompetitors are being restricted in bidding for deposits orloans.   On Friday, the Financial Corp. thrift unit called itsseizure by the Office of Thrift Supervision &quot;a completesurprise.&quot; Just last week, the parent Financial Corp.reported first-quarter net income of $37.7 million, or $1.71a share, including a $36.5 million extraordinary gain from adebt-for-equity swap.   Philip Brinkerhoff, Financial Corp.'s chairman and chiefexecutive officer, called the debt swap &quot;an incredible boonto our capital position,&quot; adding: &quot;We will continue toaggressively pursue opportunities to increase capital,including capital infusion or sale.&quot;   But while the one-time gain eliminated a tangible-capitaldeficit, it still left the thrift unit with only aboutone-third of the capital required by regulators, and littleor no operating profit. The parent, which has $4.7 billion ofassets, incurred a loss of $60.3 million, or $10.01 a share,for all of 1989.   Moreover, the parent company recently let go its auditor,Deloitte andamp; Touche, after the accounting firm refused to issuean opinion concerning the 1989 financial statement due to&quot;material weakness in internal controls,&quot; according to aFinancial Corp. news release.   Regulators are apt to move swiftly against an evennominally solvent Sandamp;L if they find evidence that the thrifthas insufficient controls to monitor and stanch losses. TheOTS already had prohibited Santa Barbara Savings from makingnew loans, an order considered by some regulators to betantamount to a death sentence. Regulators were unavailablefor comment over the weekend.   In composite trading Friday on the New York StockExchange, Financial Corp. closed at 25 cents a share, off3.125 cents.   Separately, Resolution Trust Corp., created under thethrift-bailout bill to manage failed institutions, said itapproved the sale of First Federal Savings andamp; Loan inBakersfield, Calif., for $1.5 million to Bank of AmericaNational Trust and Savings Association, a unit of BankAmericaCorp. Under the sale, the BankAmerica unit will assume $125.2million in deposits and secured liabilities.   The BankAmerica unit will acquire $78.3 million of thefailed Bakersfield institution's assets, which include $21.5million in cash and $56.8 million in loans.</TEXT></DOC>
