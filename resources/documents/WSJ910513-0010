The sale culminates the U.S. bank's foray into thesecondary Causeway Bay district. The effort began when itbought half of the 38-story building in 1983 and came fullcircle about 18 months ago, when it decided to return to theCentral business district by taking a stake in a majorbuilding project to be completed next year. Both the old andnew buildings prominently carry the Citibank name.</LP><TEXT>   Steven Baker, Citibank's country corporate officer, saidselling the floors, comprising roughly 250,000 square feet,is in line with the group's policy of selling off noncoreassets. It will also enable the company to join together thebulk of its staff, divided between Central and theheadquarters building several miles away.   A Citibank official indicated the bank made HK$350 millionin profit on the sale. Charles Wheatman, a director atproperty firm Jones Lang Wootton, said the bank received ahandsome price for the floors, given the soft local marketfor office space.   But analysts said the Causeway Bay move was a bad one,both because the district failed to develop into asignificant financial center and the bank could have made farmore by investing in other local property. &quot;With hindsight,I'd say it was an enormous mistake,&quot; said a senior propertyanalyst.</TEXT></DOC>
