(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Arizona voters will decide this Novemberwhether to drop an unenforced constitutional provision that barswomen _ like Gov. Rose Mofford _ from holding the state's topoffices.   The Senate voted 27-to-0 Monday for a proposed constitutionalamendment to remove language that restricts the top offices to men.The House already has passed the proposed amendment, so the Senatevote automatically places the issue on the November generalelection ballot.   The constitution technically now allows only men to be governor,secretary of state, attorney general, school superintendent andtreasurer.   Women have held those jobs for years, including Mrs. Mofford,who had been secretary of state since 1978 and succeeded to thegovernorship on April 4 when Gov. Evan Mecham was convicted on twoimpeachment counts by the Senate.   Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens said Monday he wonders whatwill happen if voters reject the amendment. However, the federalconstitution supersedes the state document in any case.   Assistant Minority Leader Lela Alston predicted the proposedamendment will be approved. Nonetheless, she added, Arizona hasoften been accused of being a backward state and the vote may show``the level of real discrimination against women. It will be aninteresting vote.''   A rejection of the amendment would be ``a terrible, terriblething to have,'' Ms. Alston said.</TEXT></DOC>
