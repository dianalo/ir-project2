Bush refused to use his authority under provisions of the RailwayLabor Act to appoint a presidential review panel to investigate thelabor strife _ a step that would have automatically delayed a strikefor 60 days.   ``I have decided not to accept this recommendation,'' Bush saidin a statement released at mid-afternoon by the White House pressoffice.   ``The National Mediation Board has for many months attemptedunsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement,'' Bush said,``and I have no reason to believe that an additional investigationor the 60-day delay that would be entailed would produce such anagreement.''   In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and relatedactivities, he said, the Transportation Department ``will monitorthe situation and will, in addition, take whatever steps are neededto protect the safety of the traveling public.''   ``I urge responsible labor officials not to try to influenceresolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportationsystem through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties,'' Bushsaid. ``Such boycotts would unfairly burden millions of citizens,not only affecting necessary travel but also affecting shipments ofconsumer goods and the ability of workers to earn a living.''   Bush noted that secondary boycotts are not permitted in otherareas of the economy. He said that if the Eastern Airlines disputethreatens to disrupt essential transportation services, he will askCongress to pass legislation ``making it unlawful to use secondarypicketing and boycotts against neutral carriers.''   ``We cannot allow an isolated labor-management dispute to disruptthe nation's transportation system,'' the president said.   Eastern, meanwhile, sent its machinists home this morning, citing``significant amounts of vandalism,'' and saying the action wasintended to prevent sabotage in the hours before the strikedeadline. A federal court order allowed the action.   Federal mediators, who were meeting with the negotiators at anundisclosed Washington location, said the Eastern offer Thursdaybrought hope of a settlement in the 17-month-old dispute.   ``They likely will meet pretty much all day,'' said NationalMediation Board spokesman David Bushnell. ``I expect it will goright up to the deadline if necessary.''   Eastern's chief operating officer in Miami, Joe Leonard, saidmachinists were given a paid holiday and told to return to work forshifts starting at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, after the strikedeadline.   ``This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect thebargaining,'' Leonard said at a news conference. He said managementpersonnel would handle maintenance and other ground duties for therest of the day.   Eastern pilots, rejecting an unusual videotaped offer by airlineowner Frank Lorenzo in separate contract negotiations, said Thursdaythey would refuse to cross machinist picket lines.   Other unions also pledged support in a plan to block work atother airlines, railways and sea transport companies if a strike iscalled by the 8,500-member Eastern local of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.   A federal judge in Minnesota ordered against any sympathy strikeat Northwest Airlines, but the union was seeking orders in anotherfederal court here to allow such action.   Bush met in the Oval Office for more than a half-hour with LaborSecretary Elizabeth Dole and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.   The airline wanted Bush to stay out of it, saying it is losing $1million a day and can't afford the delay. Eastern, owned by TexasAir Corp., has pledged to keep operating if the machinists strike.   The AFL-CIO and 33 senators led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,had asked Bush to act.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said other union members shouldhonor the Eastern pickets wherever they are legally set up.   Kirkland accused Lorenzo, who bought Texas Air in 1986, of``finding it worth his while to purchase a good company and stripits assets, rather than operate it fairly and decently.'' The unionaccuses Lorenzo of planning to sell off Eastern assets or transferthem to non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air.   Kirkland, asked after the Eastern offer what the chances of astrike would be if Bush did not act, said, ``about a 100 percentchance.''   Kirkland and other union leaders, at a news conference, said theydoubted there would be any settlement because they believe Lorenzowants to dismantle the airline, which they said is worth about $500million.   The senators' letter, signed by 31 Democrats and GOP Sens.Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said60 U.S. cities in 27 states depend on Eastern for passenger andfreight service.   ``Any interruption in this service will result in a majordisruption of interstate commerce,'' the letter said. Eastern fliesabout 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040 daily flights.It has 250 airliners.   The letter noted that no president has refused to act on amediation board recommendation to call a special panel in an airlinedispute.   Other airlines contend their workers would be violating no-strikeclauses in their contracts if they honored picket lines set up byEastern strikers.   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paulgranted a temporary restraining order to prevent Northwest's21,000-member machinist union from staging a sympathy strike. Thejudge said the order ``is in the best interest of the public'' toavoid disrupting flights.   Union lawyers were asking U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt inWashington to stop the airlines, including Northwest, from blockingpicketing of other companies which it says is allowed in a 1987Supreme Court decision affecting transportation companies.   Carol Perkins, spokeswoman for the Association of AmericanRailroads, said the group was calling on Congress to outlaw suchsecondary picketing.   W. Graham Claytor Jr., president of Amtrak, said the commuterrailroad would continue limited operations in the event of asympathy walkout in the face of Eastern picketing, but only for ``aday or two.'' If there is no picketing and Eastern air servicestops, the railroad would add trains, he said.   Eastern's machinists said the new company offer was animprovement but still called for pay cuts rather than pay increases.   Eastern originally wanted to cut salaries and get otherconcessions from the union totaling $150 million. The union wanted$50 million in raises.   ``The company is still looking for major concessions, but it'snot $150 million,'' said union official Wally Haber in Miami afterthe new offer.   Eastern said the contract would reduce mechanics' pay but stillkeep their salaries 13 percent higher than employees who took a 20percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over the company in 1986. It saidbaggage handlers' cuts would be no greater than those of otheremployees.</TEXT></DOC>
