This is accomplishedby calibrating the International Association for Water Pollution Researchand Control Model and associated SSSP microcomputer software to operatingdata at six full-scale activated-sludge treatment plants. Field datawere used to calibrate the key biological parameters contained in themodel so that the oxygen utilization rates, dissolved oxygen concentrations,mixed-liquor volatile suspended-solids concentrations, and process performancesimulated by the model matched the corresponding quantities observedin the treatment plants. The results showed that the model and associatedsoftware package provide a useful capability to analyze, simulate, andpredict oxygen utilization rates. It was possible to obtain reasonableagreement between the measured and simulated values of oxygen uptakerate, dissolved oxygen concentration, and other process parameters atmost of the plants studied.</TEXT></DOC>
