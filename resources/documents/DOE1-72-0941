Surveys undertaken by the AustralianRadiation Laboratory (ARL) in 1977 and later have revealed extensivecontamination, particularly by plutonium, on fragments and soil particlesin the test area. A study is now in progress to evaluate the inhalationhazards from plutonium-bearing dust. A preliminary study of sieved soilfractions shows that the concentration of plutonium is highest in thefinest (andless;45 micron) fraction. The concentrations remain high right downinto the respirable region (1 to 10 micron). There are indications thatat least 25% of this plutonium is in the form of pure PuO/sub 2/ particles.A network of high volume and low volume air samplers has been set upat Maralinga to measure plutonium concentrations in air. A dust-raisingapparatus has been constructed to study the concentration and particle-sizedependence of plutonium in respirable dust.</TEXT></DOC>
