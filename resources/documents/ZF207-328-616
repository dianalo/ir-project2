IBM, ALR, Grid Systems Corp. and Tandy Corp are the only UScomputer makers offering MCA machines.andP;  One reason the EISA maybecome the more successful architecture is the need for a 32-bitbus, particularly in the US.andP;  The MCA is popular in Europe,however, holding 30 percent of the market for 80286 and 80386microcomputers, perhaps because Europe is more of a multi-vendorenvironment.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Compaq Computer Corp.
