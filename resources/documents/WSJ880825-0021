The Treasury sold $7.27 billion of notes due in five years and two months at an average yield of 9.04%. That was about as expected but was the highest yield in about 2 3/4 years. In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues fell by about 1/4 of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    Many investment strategists expect interest rates to increase further over the next few months and thus are buying only very short-term securities. Also, interest rates in Europe are expected to climb again soon, with the U.S. dollar declining in the currency markets.    Speculation is especially widespread that West Germany will raise its rates shortly. The Bundesbank has scheduled a news conference following today's meeting of its policy-setting central bank council. A spokesman for the West German central bank said the council will focus on &quot;topical issues&quot; at its first meeting since a summer recess. He wouldn't elaborate.    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and the 16 other members of the board are certain to talk about the weaker mark and the rising risk of inflation. Many economists believe the Bundesbank will boost interest rates after a series of concerted dollar sales by central banks had limited success in swaying bullish dollar sentiments in foreign-exchange markets.    Fears that U.S. rates will climb again soon discouraged many Japanese investors from buying the new Treasury notes, analysts said. Japanese purchases at yesterday's auction were &quot;light,&quot; said Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New York.    Mr. Brusca said Japanese investors are concerned about the U.S. bond market's deep slump recently and that many expect U.S. borrowing costs to increase further. Also, &quot;many Japanese investors fear that the dollar already has had its best run, and that's clearly not the sort of thing that makes Japanese investors want to buy dollar-denominated securities.&quot;    Even though U.S. rates have risen sharply over the past few months, analysts say the economy continues to expand at a vigorous clip and that inflationary pressures are building. Thus, they expect the Federal Reserve to tap lightly on its credit brakes again soon, probably in mid-September.    &quot;Interest rates are headed upward,&quot; predicted Norman Robertson, senior vice president and chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. &quot;It's going to take higher interest rates to insure that the economy doesn't overheat.&quot;    Fed officials are expected to wait at least until a week from tomorrow before raising rates any further. That's when the Labor Department is scheduled to release its August report on the nation's employment picture. If that report shows large gains in employment, analysts predict the Fed will drive up short-term interest rates further.    &quot;My guess would be over the next six months or so, we would see a rise of roughly 100 basis points (one percentage point) in short-term interest rates,&quot; Mr. Robertson said. He predicted, for example, that the interest rate on federal funds will surge above 9%. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, has averaged just over 8% recently.    The Commerce Department today is scheduled to release a new estimate of the economy's second-quarter growth. That report is likely to show an annual growth rate of 3.3%, up from the preliminary estimate of 3.1%, according to the average estimate of 12 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Estimates ranged from 2.8% to 3.8%, after adjusting for inflation.    Foreign Bonds   Speculation about whether West Germany will tighten credit dominated European markets yesterday.    In West Germany, prices of government bonds edged higher but activity was light as investment managers waited to see whether the central bank raises rates. The government's 6 3/4% issue due 1998 closed at 99.60 bid, up from 99.40 Tuesday. The yield fell to 6.80% from 6.83%.    Analysts who expect the Bundesbank to boost rates say an increase is needed to bolster the sagging mark in the foreign-exchange markets and to restrain inflation.    U.S. short-term interest rates on average are more than three percentage points higher than West German rates, making the dollar a higher-yielding currency and more attractive for international investors. Raising West German interest rates would narrow the gap and help take pressure off the West German currency, economists say.    Nevertheless, not everyone is convinced an increase in either the discount or the Lombard rates, now pegged at 3% and 5%, respectively, is a foregone conclusion. Some Bundesbank board members fear a rate boost could stifle the domestic economy, already threatened by government plans to raise consumer taxes next January.    In addition, this week's report of slower M3 money supply growth during June in West Germany was seen as taking some of the pressure off the central bank to tighten credit. On Tuesday, the Bundesbank left the interest rate unchanged at 4.25% on its latest one-month securities repurchase agreements, a key refinancing facility for banks and a key indicator of West German monetary policy trends.    &quot;That announcement could be seen as an early indicator that nothing will happen on Thursday. The dollar also is looking a little more stable, reducing the urgency for action,&quot; said Norbert Walter, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank AG. &quot;But the Bundesbank is facing a difficult decision, and there are always surprises.&quot;    One possible course of action for the Bundesbank is to leave rates unchanged, while increasing the amount of funds made available to banks under its discount facility. This would ease money market rates and reduce the recent flood of bids for repurchase agreements, intended for fine-tuning rather than a staple source of central bank funds. But it wouldn't go far in supporting the Deutsche mark.    In Tokyo, prices of Japanese government bonds closed lower in light activity.    The benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.225% in the interdealer market, up from 5.175%. The range was 5.175% to 5.245%. The closing yield represented a price of 98.59, down 0.31. Volume in the benchmark issue was light.    As expected, the coupon rate on the Japanese government's new 10-year bond issue was set at 5%, making it a reopening of the No. 112 issue. The issue price is 97.50, 1.5 yen lower than the August tranche, for a yield of 5.384%, up from 5.15% in August.    The new bonds were selling in the secondary market late yesterday at a discount of about 0.20 yen to the issue price, an improvement from about 0.50 yen at midday, traders said.    In London, prices of government bonds fell slightly amid concern about a report due today on July's trade data.    Prices moved up from earlier lows when it became clear that the government wasn't going to signal another increase in base rates, as many had expected during the day. However, dealers said, this didn't stop speculation that rates will rise to 11 1/2% from 11% in the near term. The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 fell 12/32 of a point to 114 27/32 to yield 9.80%.    Treasury Securities -   The yield on the Treasury's latest 30-year bonds rose slightly to 9.40% yesterday from 9.38% Tuesday. It now stands slightly below Monday's level of 9.45%, which was the highest in more than eight months. The price of the issue declined 7/32 of a point to 97 1/4.    The price of the latest 10-year Treasury notes fell 5/32 to 99 13/32, while the yield rose to 9.34% from 9.32%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term government bonds dipped 1.88 points to close at 1200.53. It ranged between 1199.80 and 1204.23.    The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.23% bid from 7.16% Tuesday. The rate on six-month bills finished unchanged at 7.46%. The average yield of 9.04% on the new five-year, two-month Treasury notes yesterday was up from 8.77% at the previous auction May 26. It was the highest since 9.13% at an auction Nov. 27, 1985. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                     5 Years-2 Months Notes    Applications                            $21,567,956,000    Accepted bids                            $7,268,146,000    Accepted at low price                               82%    Accepted noncompetitively                  $600,000,000    Average price (Rate)                      99.759(9.04%)    High price (Rate)                         99.800(9.03%)    Low price (Rate)                          99.759(9.04%)    Interest rate                                        9%    The notes are dated Sept. 1 and mature Nov. 15, 1993.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices were little changed to off 1/8 point in light late trading.   A handful of new issues came to market Wednesday, including a $175 million issue of 30-year debentures from May Department Stores Co. The issue, which was increased from the originally planned $150 million, sold out quickly.   The debentures were priced as a 10 7/8% issue at par, a spread of 140 basis points above the rate of the Treasury 8 7/8% notes of 2017. The debentures contain a sinking fund designed to retire 5% of the issue annually, beginning in the 11th year. The company has the option to increase that sinking fund to 15% in any one year. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. was lead underwriter.   Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co., a unit of Continental Illinois Corp., launched a $100 million four-year note offering priced as a 9 7/8% issue at 99.905 to yield 9.905%, a spread of 97 basis points above the rate of the Treasury four-year note. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was lead underwriter.   In the high-yield market, Beker Industries Corp.'s 15 7/8% debentures due 2003 fell 2 1/8 points to close at 129. At one time during the session, the debentures traded as low as 120, having dropped 11 1/8 points.   Dealers said profit-taking by investors who had purchased the securities at a substantially lower price was responsible for the decline.   Beker has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since October 1985. The debenture issue has been in default since that time.   Investors have recently bid up the price of the debentures because, under a proposed reorganization plan, they will receive shares of common stock in a newly formed fertilizer company that is expected to post strong earnings next year.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities closed mostly unchanged, having spent the bulk of the session within an extremely narrow range.   Activity was light on both the buy and sell sides, muted in part by the performance of the Treasury issues.   Traders said the first revision due today of second-quarter gross national product figures could provide some direction for rates. An upward revision to the previous estimate of 3.1% GNP growth likely would stimulate concern over the possibility of a tighter Federal Reserve credit stance.   The September Ginnie Mae 10% issue was quoted at 98 18/32 late, unchanged on the day and at the low end of a session range of about 98 18/32 to 98 22/32.   The 10% issue has a bond equivalent yield of about 10.37%, bringing their spread to the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 104 basis points, down one basis point from late Tuesday.   The Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% issue was quoted at 95 20/32 late in the session, and the 9% issue at 92 22/32, flat for the session. Freddie Mac's 10% issue was off 2/32 at 98 6/32. Fannie Mae's 10% issue also was down 2/32 at 98 20/32.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds and bond futures outperformed their Treasury counterparts yesterday based, as in past weeks, largely on the low volume of new tax-exempt bond issues.   Municipal bond prices finished unchanged to as much as 1/2 point higher. For example, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted late in the day at 89 7/8, up 1/8 point, after having held within a 1/4-point range for much of the day. The bonds yield 8.10%, down from 8.11% Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
