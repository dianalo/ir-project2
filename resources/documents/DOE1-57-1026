The performance of the natural gas industry is allthe more remarkable because production stems increasingly from remotefields astride the Arctic Circle in northwest Siberia, and delivery ofgas to market areas is dependent on the laying of thousands of milesof large-diameter pipelines from the producing area to consumers in theEuropean USSR. The paper discusses pipeline construction; the developmentof the Urengoy field, astride the Arctic Circle; the plans for the developmentof Yamburg, a field 150 miles north of Urengoy, and work at a Turkmeniafield.</TEXT></DOC>
