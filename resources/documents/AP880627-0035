Nearly three-quarters of those questioned in the national surveyagreed that the anti-war protests had a lasting effect on society,and a smaller majority said the movement forged lasting change inU.S. foreign policy.   But those who said the protests changed American society weresplit on whether the impact was positive or negative: 51 percentsaid positive and 41 percent said negative. The rest didn't know.   The division was even more pronounced among those who said theprotests had a lasting effect on U.S. foreign policy: 47 percentsaid the effect was positive and 45 percent said it was negative.The poll's overall margin of error was 3 percentage points.   The movement protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam Warreached a crescendo in the summer of 1968, as demonstratorsoccupied college campuses and battled with police during theDemocratic National Convention in Chicago.   Two decades later, the Media General-AP poll found thatdivisions over the protest movement in many cases remain.   For example, a majority agreed that the protests influenced U.S.policy in Vietnam, and 59 percent said the effect was to shortenthe nation's involvement in the war. But 23 percent said theprotests prolonged the war.   In another measure, the respondents who thought the protestsinfluenced Vietnam policy were asked if the effect was to preventthe United States from winning the war. Fifty-eight percent saidno, but 30 percent said yes.   More people who identified themselves as conservatives said theanti-war protests prevented the United States from winning inVietnam. Similarly, conservatives were more likely to say theprotests had a negative effect on American society and U.S. foreignpolicy.   Fifty-two percent of respondents said society is more liberalnow than 20 years ago. But few said they personally have becomemore liberal; a greater share said they are more conservative andthe greatest share said their views are about the same.   The respondents also subscribed to the view of young peopletoday as less activist and more self-interested than those in 1968.More than 60 percent agreed with statements that young people``were more interested in changing society'' and ``were moreidealistic'' 20 years ago; less than a third disagreed.   Even more, 71 percent, agreed that ``young people are moreselfish now than they were 20 years ago,'' and just 23 percentdisagreed. Smaller majorities said the youth of 1988 are moreapathetic and at the same time more realistic than were theircounterparts 20 years ago.   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephoneinterviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204adults.
