The research and development projects in FY 1988 includesthe advanced battery power storage system, fuel-cell power generationtechnology, super heat pump/energy accumulation system, superconductingcurrent application technology and ceramic gas turbine. The researchand development of the leading, fundamental energy conservation technologiesinclude nine projects such as the coal-field MHD power generation andthe combined reactor provided with functional separating membrane. Theinternational technical cooperative activities between Japan and theU.S., Japan and France and Japan and Thailand are promoted. The governmentgrant to the development of energy conservation technology in the privatesectors and the standardization are continued. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
