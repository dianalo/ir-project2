The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jack Brooks,D-Texas, ruled out of order an attempt by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,R-Wis., to bring before the committee the amendment backed byPresident Bush.   Supporters of the amendment contend that changing theConstitution is the only way to overcome last month's ruling by theSupreme Court that flag-burning was a protected form of freeexpression.   Democratic leaders, including Brooks and House Speaker Thomas S.Foley, D-Wash., are pursuing a regular statute designed to meet thecourt's objections.   Their strategy is aimed at avoiding damage to constitutionalrights and demonstrating that Democrats abhor flag burning. Thesymbolism of the flag was used by Bush in last year's presidentialcampaign against the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis.   Brooks scheduled another meeting of the panel for Thursday totake action on his proposed bill to outlaw desecration of the flag,including burning, with penalties of up to a year in jail plus afine. The bill could come before the full House next week.   ``It is my firm believe that a statute punishing flag burning...can be drafted in a way that is consistent with the Supreme Court'sdecision,'' said Brooks. A statute could be approved much morequickly than an amendment, which requires ratification by thestates, he said.   However, Sensenbrenner pointed out that even some opponents ofamending the Constitution don't believe a regular statute can undowhat the court decided.   ``This is nonsense, and a ridiculous way to solve the problemand a cop-out on our legislative responsibilities,'' he said. Theissue won't ``go away,'' he said, and blocking the constitutitonalamendment ``is going to come back soon enough to haunt those whomade the decision.''   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the committee'sconstitutional rights subcommittee, said he was convinced from mailhe was receiving that the public was becoming less enthralled withthe idea of a constitutional amendment.   ``I believe we must act in the way that causes least violence tothe First Amendment, least damage to the Bill of Rights that for200 years has made us the envy of the world,'' he said.   The assertion by Democratic leaders that public support for anamendment was beginning to lag in recent days was challenged as``self-deception'' on Wednesday in the Senate by Minority LeaderBob Dole, R-Kan.   ``The simple truth is that the vast majority of the Americanpeople want a constitutional amendment,'' Dole said, citing 400letters and petition he has received on the issue.   The Senate has scheduled action in October on both a statute anda constitutional amendment on flag burning.</TEXT></DOC>
