Researchreported in 1989 on 50 alcoholic men found damage to their hearts by acombination of alcohol and hypertension. But because women metabolize alcoholdifferently than men, it is not clear whether the study's findings also aretrue for women.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WOMEN DEPRESSED MORE OFTEN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Health andamp; FitnessUpdate  </MEMO><TEXT>     Blume said studies had elucidated the natural history of alcohol problemsin men, but researchers still know &quot;very little about their development inwomen, particularly in relation to traumatic life events such as incest andabuse, and to other diagnoses such as major depression and eating disorders,all of which are common in female problem drinkers of all ages.&quot;;  Is yourhouse toxic?;    For consumers who are becoming increasingly aware of theenvironment and personal health, here are three new is a new products that canhelp you find out if your home needs to be detoxified.;    The Safer Home TestKit offers devices to assist you in testing your residence for toxic safety.;   Although radon gas testing kits have been on the market for some time, thiskit combines a radon tester with four additional products to monitor your homefor lead contamination, microwave-oven radiation, carbon monoxide andultraviolet radiation.;    The Safer Home Test Kit ($49 to $59, retail)includes a radon canister from Radon Testing Corp. of America; lead alertsolutions to test dishes, toys and water pipes; a carbon monoxide detector; amicrowave-oven tester for leaking radiation; and a card that meters intensityof ultraviolet rays, showing how effective windows, sunscreens and sunglassesare.;    The kit is available in Hammacher Schlemmer catalogs, (800)543-3366or from Safer Home Test Kit, 325 N.
