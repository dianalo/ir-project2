<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-0340 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of 36 perovskite ceramics based on SrZrO/sub 3/ has been preparedand investigated as potential materials for electrodes for MHD systemsusing hydrogen as a fuel. All ceramics prepared were found to be relativelydark in color, indicating optical absorptions associated with the existenceof conduction electrons. Many were found to be soft and crumbly afterfiring at 1400/sup 0/ or 1500/sup 0/C, but became hard and often quiteshiny when fired at 1650/sup 0/C using a special graphite induction furnace.In most cases, this increase in hardness was also accompanied by a significantdensity increase. Most ceramics were found to be composed of second perovskitestructures, i.e. manganates of Ba, Ca, Sr or La, in addition to the zirconatephase. Their room temperature electrical resistivity was determined bythe van der Paaw method. Results show that resistivity falls below 100ohm-cm (the value acceptable for MHD electrodes) for certain ceramicsof the types tested. The resistivity value was found to vary significantlywith firing temperature; this can be correlated with the crystal structuresand number of phases within the ceramic. Weight loss measurements doneat 1440/sup 0/C have enabled three ceramics to be identified as potentialmaterials for thermoelectric converters requiring high temperature structuraland chemical stability in oxidizing atmospheres. An appendix reviewsthe current status of the basis for development of perovskite ceramicsand specific materials are discussed on the basis of relevant thermoelectricproperties. Also included is a review of semiconductor thermocouplesand of materials selection for insulators and electrodes for use in MHDsystems. 91 refs., 3 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
