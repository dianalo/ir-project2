Union President Robert White said he &quot;would hope that we could reach (a tentative pact) by midnight&quot; last night.    Ford negotiators declined comment on the talks.    The union previously set a deadline of 10 a.m. EDT today for a strike or settlement at the Canadian unit of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. The CAW represents 13,000 workers at Ford Canada.    Mr. White said a &quot;grab bag&quot; of local issues remained unresolved at two of the union's biggest locals. He declined to be more specific. The locals represent close to 8,000 union workers at Ford Canada's three Ontario assembly plants.    But Mr. White said several other issues were resolved between the sides, including the union's demand that Ford Canada's parent clarify the possible impact on Canadian jobs of the job security pact ratified yesterday by Ford workers in the U.S.    Mr. White said Ford gave the union a letter indicating the pact &quot;won't be used to affect the employment levels&quot; of Ford Canada.    The union and Ford also reached agreement on a severance package for certain office workers and a plan to set up &quot;task forces&quot; to study possible changes to job classifications and work rules. Mr. White said the union made no &quot;binding commitment to change&quot; the current classification structure or work rules.    As previously reported, Ford Canada presented a contract offer Tuesday that the union said addressed its main economic demands, including inflation-indexed pensions for future retirees.    Talks between the union and General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit are on hold pending the outcome of the Ford talks. The union's previous contracts with General Motors of Canada Ltd. and Ford Canada expired Sept. 14. </TEXT></DOC>
