During a speech at a political fund-raiser, the presidentdeparted from his text to praise Mrs. Aquino.   ``Just last week democracy was challenged in the Philippines,''Bush said. ``And we stood with President Aquino and we continue tostand with her and with democracy now. We must not let thedemocratic process be overthrown by revolution and by militarytakeover.''   Earlier, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with thepresident on a three-state trip to underline anti-drug efforts andboost Republican candidates, said the administration also hasconcerns about Mrs. Aquino and certain of her government's policies.   ``But that does not diminish the fact that we support her andher government and we hope they're successful. We support hergovernment without reservations and do not put strings on thatsupport,'' Fitzwater said.   He was asked about comments the day before by a senioradministration official suggesting that Mrs. Aquino's politicalfuture was in doubt _ and that she should be more attentive toeliminating sources of discontent in her country.   ``There are a lot of people who are willing to speculate to thateffect in private. But, on the record we would not speculate onthat. She's a democratically elected leader and we want her tosucceed,'' Fitzwater told reporters.   Leases on the two U.S. bases in the Philippines _ Clark Air Baseand the Subic Bay naval installation _ expire in 1991.   Before leaving Washington, Bush met at the White House withseveral congressional leaders who commented afterward.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said, ``It appears that theimmediate threat to Mrs. Aquino's government has been removed, butit's troubling that some of the rebel military elements (are) amongthe most professional and proficient Philippine military.''   Another Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said the coupattempt raised concerns about U.S. aid for the Philippines,especially regarding the future of the U.S. bases there.   ``We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to bespent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said Leahy.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the coup effort was thestrongest so far and ``our intelligence shows us if they keepstepping it up grade by grade, she will be in deep trouble.''   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher set a moreoptimistic tone, saying the Aquino government ``has shownincredible resilience in this situation.''   U.S. officials expect ``that the Philippine people can pulltogether under President Aquino's leadership,'' he said.   In Houston, Bush concentrated on the anti-drug fight, standingin a park once overrun by drug dealers and likening domesticbattles against addiction and crime to the struggles for freedomsweeping Eastern Europe.   ``As with the new freedom in Eastern Europe, freedom from drugsisn't something the government can give you. You've got to take astand. You've got to take back the streets. And that's exactly whatyou did, right here,'' Bush said.   He spoke to a civic association at Winzer Park and praised thecommunity for driving drug dealers out of the park.   ``In recent years, the dream on Main Street became the nightmareon Elm Street,'' Bush said.   ``One thousand people swept into the park. One thousand peopleswept the drug dealers out. They haven't come back.'' Bush said.``You were united, you were determined, you were angry and you wereright.''   On the trip, Fitzwater also was asked about the seniorofficial's comments on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called Gorbachev'seconomic views ``simplistic'' and said he displayed a lack ofsophistication in his meeting at Malta last weekend with Bush.   Fitzwater said the official should probably have not used theword simplistic and that ``we wouldn't use that word.'' At the sametime, Fitzwater said, ``there is a lack of knowledge'' onGorbachev's part ``about how free enterprise systems work and howmarket economies work.''   Later, Bush told a Republican fundraising dinner for Sen. PhilGramm of Texas that his summit last week with Gorbachev ``was asuccess, a chance to improve an important relationship.''   ``Tensions have been reduced. But there was one area where I hadto speak firmly and frankly and that was on Central America. Therecan be no misunderstanding here,'' Bush said. Bush has repeatedlyaccused the Soviets' allies in Central America, Cuba and Nicaragua,of funneling East bloc-built arms to the rebels in El Salvador.   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who flewaboard Air Force One with Bush, said that the event was expected toyield $2.8 million, which he said would make it the biggestpolitical fund-raiser in history.   Fitzwater said Bush decided to mix anti-drug speeches with GOPfund-raising appearances, here and then on Friday in Denver ``todramatize the efforts of the president in that area and keep themomentum going.''   Conducting such official business also will reduce thepercentage of the cost of the trip that must be picked up by theRepublican National Committee.   Bush, who claims Houston as his voting residence, told hisWenzer Park audience, ``It's always great to be back in Texas. Andespecially after that little storm in Malta _ it's great to be backon dry land.''   ``The talks in Malta remind us all that we live in dramatic andexciting times,'' Bush said under overcast skies.   ``That's true not only in Eastern Europe, where people areseeking freedom to travel and freedom to vote _ but right here inthe U.S.A., where brave men and women have used people power tofight for another kind of freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom fromcrime. Freedom from drugs.''</TEXT></DOC>
