 Glaxo, Incorporated, a subsidiary of the world's second largestpharmaceutical company, is the fourth largest maker of prescription drugs inthe United States.andM;The process by which a new drug is developed and approved for use by the U.S.andO;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) normally takes between 10 and 12 years,generating an application for approval of some 90,000 document pages,at anaverage cost of $100 million.andM;In the process of research and development, according to Dr. Joel Dobbs,director of information services, researchers must conduct an exhaustivesearch of the scientific literature to assess the current state of knowledgeabout the medical problem they hope to solve.andP;  &quot;It's very easy for yourresearchers to get bogged down trying to find what people have donepreviously and incorporating it into their own work,&quot; Dr. Dobbs said.andM;Publishing the application after 10 or 12 years of Randamp;D is a huge task thatculminates in renting a truck to take the application to the FDA.andP;  (90,000letter-sized pages would fill 18 cartons approximately 11-1/2 by 17 by 10inches.)andM;Glaxo hired a consultant to perform a needs assessment.andP;  The study found,among other things, that high level scientists spent six hours a daysearching for, retrieving, and using paper-based information.andP;  Other managersspent 5 hours, administrators spent 2-1/2 hours, and executives spent about 1hour on the same tasks.andM;Thus, it was easy to sell management on a strategy that would automate theway scientists and researchers worked, to make them more productive andshorten the time to market for new pharmaceutical products.andM;Specifically, the imaging system was to provide a central, readily accessibledatabase of information generated by the Randamp;D process; facilitateinformation-sharing and information searches; and reduce storage space andredundancy.andP;  One 50,000-page report, Dr. Dobbs reported, was found to havebeen duplicated three times, in departments next door to each other, becauseinformation-sharing was unsupported.andM;Running the numbers, Dr. Dobbs was able to predict a discounted cash flowyield of 57 percent through 1991, a 2.1 year payback period, and significantsavings in personnel time arid construction costs for facilities to handleeven more paper.andM;SELECTION OF THE SYSTEM.andP;  The system consists of a Plexus P/95 DataServer, aCygnet 110-platter optical jukebox with 4 drives, 21 user workstations, 12printers, 2 scanners, an optical character recognition server, and afacsimile server.andM;&quot;Our organization eats PCs; everybody's got one.andP;  We have more personalcomputers in our company than we have people,&quot; Dr. Dobbs said.andP;  &quot;We didn'twant to put a workstation on everybody's desk, so we put them in departmentalareas, and they're shared by workgroups.&quot;andM;Glaxo is a VAX computing shop, so it was decided that the indexing componentwould reside in a VAX cluster.andP;  The system uses a full-text indexing package.andO;Not every document is included in the full-text database, but the package'sindexing and thesaurus capabilities make indexing efficient and yield somevocabulary control, which Dr. Dobbs says is very important to aninternational company.andM;One of the system specifications was that everything had to plug into Glaxo'sEthernet network.andP;  There would be no separate communications lines.andP;  Thereare a number of remote locations, including a manufacturing site 45 milesaway.andM;The jukebox and data server are in the data center, in the administrationbuilding on Glaxo's main campus.andP;  Scanning and indexing and so forth are doneat a remote site some five miles away, where most of the research anddevelopment activities are carried out.andM;USER REACTIONS.andP;  Dr. Dobbs reports that user response has been quitefavorable.andP;  He describes three classes of users at Glaxo.andP;  First are what hecalls &quot;the fearless hackers.andP;  They are usually research scientists who haveno fear of computers,&quot; he elaborated.andP;  &quot;If they crash the thing, or if thepower goes off, they just reboot and start over.andP;  We have a lot of those.andM;&quot;We also have a lot of people who think it's wonderful, but they're afraidthey'll break it,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;They require a lot of hand-holding.andP;  And,finally, some of our other folks, particularly some of our senior executives,say  &quot;Yes, that's nice.andP;  We spent a lot of money on it, but I wouldn't touchthe thing if you held a gun to my head.andP;  &quot;'andM;PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED.andP;  Major problems included &quot;quite a few&quot; software bugs,Dr. Dobbs said, but the vendors fixed them quickly.andP;  The company alsoencountered some defective optical media and a few hardware problems.andM;LESSONS LEARNED.andP;  &quot;Know what you're getting into,&quot; Dr. Dobbs said.andP;  &quot;Justbecause people demonstrate something at trade shows, doesn't mean it performsthe same way in practice.andP;  Know what you want to do.andP;  Think it over verycarefully.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
