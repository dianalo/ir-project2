The International Trade Commission on Monday will hold a hearing on Kodak's claim that three big Japanese companies have been selling disks in the U.S. at illegally low prices. Kodak is asking the U.S. to impose punitive tariffs on the Japanese goods.    The U.S. government has lately been sympathetic to cries for international trade help from its high-technology industries. Last year it slapped stiff sanctions on Japan for allegedly violating a 1986 accord on microchip trade. More recently, it threatened broad trade sanctions against Brazil for its allegedly unfair treatment of U.S. software exports.    The subject of Kodak's claim is a smaller but highly visible market: the disks used by personal computers to store data. Kodak's charge specifically concerns 3.5-inch disks, a product that has been taking hold as the microcomputer industry standard ever since International Business Machines Corp. backed it last spring with its new PS/2 product line.    Kodak officially lodged the claim late last month, in a filing by its Verbatim Corp. unit. It alleged that Sony Corp., Fuji Photo Film Co., and an affiliate of Hitachi Ltd. charge 40% to 60% less for floppy disks in the U.S. than they do in Japan, according to a Kodak lawyer.    A lawyer for the Hitachi affiliate, Hitachi Maxell Co., disputed Kodak's charges and said the Japanese firm plans to fight them. Unfair pricing petitions to the U.S. government &quot;are consistently wildly overstated,&quot; said the lawyer, Carl Schwarz.    A Sony spokesman declined to comment and a Fuji lawyer didn't return a call seeking comment. Kodak and Fuji have a ferocious rivalry in the film business, and some speculated that Kodak's petition was spurred in part by competitive zeal in that battle.    Kodak's claim is complicated by the yen's surge against the dollar, which has skewed price comparisons between the U.S. and Japan. Many Japanese suppliers haven't matched the yen's rise with corresponding price increases in the U.S., resulting in goods that may cost less in the U.S. than they do in Japan.    But a Kodak lawyer maintained that the yen isn't the whole story in this case. &quot;The dumping situation here isn't merely a matter of failing to adjust to currency changes,&quot; said Thomas Cullen.    The 3.5-inch product is the hottest segment of the $1.9 billion floppy-disk market, which some analysts believe is facing a painful shakeout. Other big American players in the market include Xidex Corp. and Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co.    According to industry researcher Magnetic Media Information Services, Japanese companies have been investing heavily for years in 3.5-inch disks. When IBM switched to 3.5-inch disks last spring, the Japanese bet paid off, and American companies were left at a disadvantage, said Jack McLaughlin, a Magnetic Media consultant.    &quot;I think its sour grapes,&quot; he said of Kodak's petition. &quot;They apparently didn't do their homework in the beginning and now they're trying to take it out on a legal arena.&quot;    Magnetic Media estimates that Verbatim earned only a scant profit on $170 million in floppy-disk revenue last year.    Still, U.S. companies' track-record in petitions for anti-dumping tariffs is good. In 1986 and 1987, the U.S. government ruled in favor of 72 out of 76 such petitions. </TEXT></DOC>
