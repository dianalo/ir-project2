A young man with a wooden right leg jogged into a soccer fieldwith a torch to inaugurate the event at this refugee camp, where 55disabled veterans competed in 11 sports. Most are the victims oflandmines strewn over vast areas of embattled Cambodia.   Several thousand refugees watched the games, standing or sittingin the dirt of this camp of bamboo and thatch-roof huts at the baseof a mountain in the eastern province of Prachinburi.   For the second straight year, Suk Sam, 22, won the dash oncrutches, leaving his closest competitor far behind on thedirt-swept field. The guerrilla soldier lost his leg in 1986, when amine exploded as he was fighting Vietnamese troops that invadedCambodia in 1978.   ``Sports keep you healthy, and I participated for the honor of mycamp,'' said the mild-mannered young man. ``I felt very sorry aboutlosing my leg, but I realized that many other people lost theirlimbs too, and I was doing my duty to my country.''   Suk Sam said that after he lost his leg, fighting prevented himfrom being evacuated from the front for six months.   Ching Pan, 29, who won the wheelchair race, lost both legs to alandmine in a fierce 1982 battle for Pnom Malai, opposite thecentral Thai border.   ``I thought I would be No. 1 in a wheelchair, and I wanted tofind out if I would succeed,'' said Ching Pan.   Prizes for the winners included scarves, T-shirts, books, sweetsand other items donated by foreign relief workers.   The fourth annual competition was organized by Operation HandicapInternational, the French-based agency that sponsors rehabilitationservices for thousands of handicapped refugee in camps along theThai-Cambodian border.   The athletes competing Saturday were brought to Khao-I-Dang fromother U.N.-aided refugee camps.   Khao-I-Dang is neutral, but the other camps are controlled byCambodian guerrillas, including the communist Khmer Rouge, thenon-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front and theforces of Cambodia's former leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.   The Khmer Rouge allowed athletes to leave only its Site 8 camp,which is U.N.-sponsored. Aid officials say the Khmer Rouge, whokilled hundreds of thousands when they led Cambodia in 1975-78, areholding refugees as virtual captives in their three other camps.   Vietnam, which has promised to withdraw its 120,000 troops by1990, is supporting the Cambodian government against theChinese-backed Khmer Rouge and other rebels.   ``(The guerrillas) are all separated for political reasons, butsome of the refugees don't care about these differences,'' saidMyriam Houtart, a Belgian medical coordinator for Operation Handicapand an Olympics organizer. ``All these people are within the samewalls here and there is no fighting. They just enjoy the games.''   Houtart said the handicapped tend to be separated from the otherrefugees. She said some camp administrators give the amputeesspecial food and other items, but ``after that, they don't want tohear about them any more.''</TEXT></DOC>
