The designed gas turbine is basedon oil-free high speed technology (gas and magnetic bearings) and onrecuperated cycle with radial turbomachinery. Typical output range ofthe whole installation is 0.23-5 MW/sub e/. Main applications of thedesigned gas turbine will be a small-scale production of electricity(and district heat) by 1) low heat value gas obtained by gasificationof peat, wood or equivalent solid fuel, 2) biogas produced at dumpingareas of solid and liquid waste and 3) near-customer production of electricityand heat by natural gas. If the plant will be reliable and easy to operate,it may have good export markets in developing countries. Compared toother ways of small-scale energy production from domestic fuels, thisgas turbine process seems to be advantageous.</TEXT></DOC>
