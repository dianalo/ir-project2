Inthe area of logical modeling and user interfaces the authors discuss:SUBJECT, a system for organizing multi-dimensional data, GUIDE, a graphicalquery system, and logical modeling of temporal data. In database operationsthey discuss sampling from relational databases, and transposition ofcompressed data. In the area of physical DB organization and access methodsthey discuss: header data compression, rearrangement of data arrays toenhance data compression, batched interpolation search, bit transposedfile organization, techniques for controlling overflow from multi-dimensionaldata structures (e.g. grid files), and data structures for temporal data.</TEXT></DOC>
