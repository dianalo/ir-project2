An extensivereview was conducted of a variety of radiation-induced microstructuraldata, searching for microstructural records of various irradiation creepmechanisms. It was found that the stress-affected evolution of dislocationmicrostructure during irradiation is considerably more complex than envisionedin most theoretical modeling studies, particularly in the types of interactivefeedback mechanisms operating. Reasonably conclusive evidence was foundfor a SIPA-type mechanism (stress-induced preferential absorption) operatingon both Frank loops and network dislocations. Stress-induced preferentialloop nucleation (SIPN) processes may also participate but are thoughtto be overshadowed by the stronger action of the SIPA-type processesoperating on Frank interstitial loops. It was not possible to discernfrom microstructural evidence between second-order SIPA and first-orderSIPA mechanisms, the latter arising from anisotropic diffusion. Evidencewas presented, however, that validates the operation of stress-inducedpreferential unfaulting of Frank loops and stress-induced growth of previouslystressed material following removal of applied stress. Dislocation glidemechanisms are also participating but the rate appears to be controlledby SIPA-type climb processes. Applied stresses were shown to generatevery anisotropic distributions of Burgers vector in the irradiation-inducedmicrostructure. 108 references, 15 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
