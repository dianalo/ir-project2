Comments received during the 30 day review period followingpublication of this Notice will be considered.Legislation enacted by Congress directed the Service, in coordination withthe Nisqually Indian Tribe (Tribe), to construct a fish hatchery on ClearCreek, in Pierce County, Washington (Section 22, Township 18 North, Range1 East, W.M.). The proposed action would include a hatchery building, rearingponds, pollution abatement lagoons, fish barrier racks, fish ladder, andwater distribution systems. As mitigation for lost spawning habitat resultingfrom the hatchery construction, a 2,000 foot long spawning channel wouldbe constructed in Fishhouse Slough, Thurston County, Washington (Section21 and 28, Township 18 North, Range 1 East, W.M.). Water for the hatchery would be supplied through a gravity fed system whichallows for low cost operation and efficient reuse. The system involvesthe construction of two small dams to impound water from springs and seepsinto two small forebays. The forebays would be contained between a steepbluff and a series of constructed dikes. Water for incumbation would bepiped directly from springs to the hatchery. The hatchery would be operated and maintained by the Tribe under an agreementwith the Service. Annual production from the hatchery would total 108,000pounds of chinook, coho, and chum salmon.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments can be provided up to July 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be addressed to: Mr. Marvin L.

Phone: (206) 456-5221.This action is designed to construct a hatchery which would rebuild andenhance anadromous fish runs in the Nisqually River Basin, which have beendepleted as a result of environmental degradation and interceptory fisheries.The rebuilding of fish runs is necessary to meet the needs of the NisquallyIndian Tribe, other domestic and International Treaties, and non-treatycommercial and sport fisheries utilizing the resource. When at full production,the estimated annual economic benefits from hatchery production is over$5.1 million. Construction of the dikes to contain the forebays (hatchery water supply)would involve filling of 7.3 acres of wetlands. Eight (8) acres of wetlandswould be created when the side slopes of the dikes and several upland areasare inundated by the forebays. Approximately 15 acres of vegetation onthe project site would be permanently converted to buildings, roads, facilities,and developed areas. A total of 21.65 acres of uplands and wetlands wouldbe flooded for impoundment of the forebays. The hatchery is located within the floodplain, but is outside the floodway.All facilities would be built above the 100 year flood level. Pollutionabatement lagoons would act as settling basins for effluent from the cleaningof rearing facilities. Hatchery waste water discharges would result insome organic enrichment to \1/4\ mile of Clear Creek. Organic enrichmentof the Nisqually River would be negligible. The Environmental Assessment considers three alternatives to the proposedaction. Two of the alternatives are variations of fill to contain the forebays.The alternatives are (1) Fill Wetlands at Backswamp and (2) Use PerimeterDike at Upper Forebay. The adverse impacts in comparison to the proposedaction are: Alternative 1_Increased wetland fill and increased size offorebay; Alternative 2_Increased size of forebay. The third alternative is No Action. This alternative would not fulfillthe goal of restoring anadromous fish runs in the Nisqually River and delaymeeting goals of the Tribe and the U.S./Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty. Development of this environmental assessment has involved a lengthy scopingprocess. The process included input from the general public as well asextensive interagency involvement. The construction of a new Service NationalFish Hatchery normally requires Environmental Impact Statement. However,based upon the little public response from the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice of Intent and the scoping process, theService decided to prepare an Environmental Assessment instead of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Portland, Oregon, June 16, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William Martin, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Regional Director. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-15141 Filed 6-26-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
