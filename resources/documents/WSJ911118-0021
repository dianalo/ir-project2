The index, before seasonal adjustment, was down 0.2% fromSeptember, Statistics Canada, a government agency, saidFriday. It was the first time in 38 years that the consumerprice index had declined in two consecutive months. TheSeptember decline was also 0.2%. Seasonally adjusted, theindex showed a decline of 0.4% in October after beingunchanged in September.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The inflation numbers are far better than anyone expectedto see by the end of this year,&quot; said Ruth Getter, a TorontoDominion Bank economist. The goal of the Finance Departmentand the Bank of Canada is to achieve stable prices, or zeroinflation, later in the 1990s.   The price report prompted gains of as much asthree-quarters of a point in Canadian government bond pricesFriday.   Neither the Finance Department nor the Bank of Canadaclaimed victory for its anti-inflation effort on the basis ofthe October data. But Philip Cross, a senior StatisticsCanada analyst, said Canada &quot;is obviously entering newterritory&quot; in its drive to stabilize prices.   The October price decline was broadly based. Excludingfood, prices of 161 consumer price index components declinedin October, a monthly record. The drop was foreshadowed bydeclines in other prices. Industry prices for finished goodshave declined for eight consecutive months, and raw materialand import prices have declined throughout this year.   Lloyd Atkinson, Bank of Montreal's chief economist, saidthe drop in inflation has cleared the way for a furthersubstantial decline in interest rates. Bank of Montrealannounced a quarter-point cut in its prime rate to 8.25%, itslowest in 13 years. The prime rate is a benchmark rate forvarious lending charges.   The decline in inflation has resulted mainly from a weakeconomy that is now in a shaky recovery from a yearlongrecession. Retailers have been discounting pricesaggressively to try to attract customers. But in September,department store sales were down 7.4% from a year earlier.Fewer than a third of Canadians feel the time is right tomake a major purchase, the Conference Board of Canada, aneconomic research group, said Friday.   Part of the consumers' caution results from a highunemployment rate, currently 10.3%. Mr. Atkinson said heexpects the unemployment rate will exceed 11% before labordemand recovers.</TEXT></DOC>
