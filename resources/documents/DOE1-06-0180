This paper outlines theobjectives, present state, and future plan of development for each ofthe following: (1) development of cascaded heat process systems, (2)development of fixed heat process systems, (3) development of advancedheat process systems, and (4) development of long-term heat storage systems.Item (4) is divided into two: (i) research and development of underrgrundheat storage systems and (ii) research and development of long-term heatstorage systems utilizing chemical reaction induced heat.
