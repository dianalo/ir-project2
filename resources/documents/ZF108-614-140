Z-248 microcomputers feed data tominicomputers at regional data centers.andP;  Those centers feed mainframes at theNavy's Finance Center in Cleveland and elsewhere.andM;SDS reduced personnel data error rates from 13 percent to 0.9 percent, hesaid.andP;  GAO's recommendations on SDS were limited to management issues because&quot;it's not a matter of proving the feasibility [of SDS],&quot; Watts said.andM;&quot;The Navy has shown they can put a system out there that does the jobwherever they put it.andP;  But at the management end they divided the pie up andonly got half the job done.&quot;andM;Lt.andP;  Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman, said officials had not received the reportand would not comment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
