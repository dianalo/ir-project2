Numerical experiments are performedin a rectangular domain with 0andless;xandless;L/sub x/ and -L/sub y//2andless;yandless;L/sub y//2and the background charged layers are distributed to form the plasmaflow U in the x direction with a velocity shear of partialU/partialynot=0. The boundaries at x = 0 and L/sub x/ are to supply plasmas identicalto the background plasma initially loaded inside the domain. The plasmaparticles reaching the boundaries are freely allowed to leave the experimentaldomain. A vortex (named the mother vortex) first develops the local chargedisturbance initially given, and subsequently new vortices (named thedaughter vortices) are generated on the charged layer. This can be thoughtof as a result of propagation of the initial disturbance: A relativeplasma flow as seen from the mother vortex can carry downstream the disturbancesoriginating from the vortex, which can trigger growth of the daughtervortex. The numerical experiments in our nonperiodic system show thatthe intervals between the vortices are relatively close to the wavelengthof the most unstable mode predicted by the linear analysis for periodicvortices. It is also shown that the temporal growth rate {gamma} of thevortex in its early growing period is comparable to the correspondinglinear growth rate of the unstable periodic vortices with the same wavelength.</TEXT></DOC>
