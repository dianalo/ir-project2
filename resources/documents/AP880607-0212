(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite missing several weeks of schoolbecause of suspensions, three street preaching children werepromoted to the next grade, their father said Tuesday.   The Strode children, Duffey, Matthew and Pepper, were suspendednumerous times because they refused to proceed into the EastfieldElementary School building when they arrived on school property eachmorning. Instead, the three children began preaching. Marion, N.C.,school officials have stressed that the suspensions resulted notfrom the preaching, but from failure to adhere to school rules.   Their father, David Strode, said in a telephone interview thatMcDowell County school officials notified him Tuesday afternoon thathis children had passed. Matthew will be in the first grade, Peppermoves to the second grade and Duffey will go to the sixth grade.   The children took comprehensive tests to complete the schoolyear. School officials would not release the test results, nor wouldthey say whether the children were promoted to their respective nextgrades.   Strode, who is building a house in another school district, saidthe preaching will stop if the local schools end their teaching ofthe theory of evolution.   ``We don't think people who think Jesus Christ was a liar shouldbe teaching our children in our schools, unless people haveliberties the other way,'' he said.   Meanwhile, residents of Marion are circulating a petition askingStrode to either keep his children from preaching in the schoolyardor to leave the town.   ``If you're going to be a preacher, public opinion can't botheryou,'' Strode said.</TEXT></DOC>
