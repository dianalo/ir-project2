 And, equally quirkily, in what most companies wouldregard as a major strategic initiative, IBM plunged right up to the neck intoelectronic data interchange with programs for all its major product families,yet breathed not a word to anyone about it except for those privileged to gettheir information from the company's InfoExpress service.andP;  For those who findthe whole subject of electronic data interchange confusing, and for adifferent take on the subject, IBM explains that &quot;companies with today'sfastest and most efficient business computer systems are often frustratedwith the long &quot;information float&quot; time required to send purchase orders,order acknowledgements, invoices, and related transactions to tradingpartners.andP;  They are handicapped not only by the need to use mail services orcouriers, but by the time required for data entry departments to capture andrecapture information.andP;  Recent business studies estimate that 80% of allcomputer-generated output is fed back into the system.andP;  Each of theserekeying steps introduces possibilities of errors, not to mention the staffrequired to perform the rekeying.andP;  As linking computers becomes easier via anetwork, more and more companies want to replace paper documents withelectronic ones.andP;  Electronic Data Interchange is the name given to thisinterchange of electronic documents between companies&quot;.andP;  And, a couple of newdefinitions that hadn't reached us before, IBM says that companies thatinitiate the electronic exchange activities with their trading partners -which can be suppliers, vendors or customers - are referred to as Sponsors,those that receive information are referred to as Trading Partners.andP;  And IBMis already using the products announced this week internally: worldwidemanufacturing sites have begun implementing data interchange using thecompany's expEDIte DataInterchange products and the IBM Information Network,and the company says its goal is a totally electronic business andcommunications process with its valued supplier network.andM;Overview of the expEDIte Data Interchange family ofandM;translatorsandM;The company this week announced IBM expEDIte DataInterchange as a family oftranslators that operates in System Application Architecture environments,providing the necessary conversion of data into standard Electronic DataInterchange format, with facilities for on-line customisation and tailoringto provide flexibility in implementing systems - and the company is promotinguse of the IBM Information Network and network interface services to enableSponsors to communicate with their Trading Partners, &quot;in most cases,regardless of the system type or communication protocol&quot; they use.andM;Announced this week are expEDIte DataInterchange Series translators for thePS/2, AS/400, System/36, System/38, and mainframes under MVS/XA and MVS/ESA.andO;DataInterchange/MVS, DataInterchange/2 and DataInterchange/400 providetranslation and business document management facilities for EDI in SAAoperating system environments; the System/36 and System/38 are outside theSAA fold.andP;  The translation facilities include a utility for reformattingbetween application data formats and the appropriate EDI standard format, inparticular ANSI/X12, UN/EDIFACT (including ODETTE), TDCC and UCS.andP;  Other EDIstandards will execute if they conform to the ANSI or UN/EDIFACT syntax.andP;  Theversions for the AS/400, System/36 and System/38 include the communicationmodules needed to interface with the IBM Information Network and forinterfacing via direct connections, and interface modules for additionalvalue-added networks for those who don't want to use IBM's own net areavailable for a fee.andP;  Standard updates will be provided and maintained aspart of the product, and on-line customisation means that the translators canbe tailored for specific application data formats, standards, tradingpartners, and network parameters.andP;  They can be integrated with new orexisting enabled applications or operated as stand- alone applications, andcan read application data from a file or write transaction documents to afile, which can be up- or down- loaded to other systems.andP;  And IBM hopes ithas thought of everything - the translators include facilities for loggingtransactions, error recovery and security.andM;Electronic Data Interchange brings big  promotion for IBM Information NetworkandM;IBM really does want people to use its own network.andP;  Once the documents havebeen translated, they are ready to be electronically transmitted, it says,and &quot;This transmission is greatly simplified by using the IBM InformationNetwork EDI services.andP;  Since the IBM Information Network can convertcommunications protocols, such as asynchronous, bisynchronous and synchronousdata link control, it is not necessary for a Sponsor to use the same computersystem or communications protocol as the trading partners, to be able toexchange documents electronically&quot;, it says.andP;  Products available includeExpedite/MVS Host, a batch interface program for MVS systems that can be usedto send free-format messages and EDI transactions over leased lines;Expedite/Direct is an access method residing in the IBM Information Network,which enables users of RJE workstations to communicate with the informationexchange electronic mailbox, using bisynchronous dial-up communications,using customer-supplied 2770, 2780, or 3780 emulator.andP;  The DataInterchangeAS/400, 38 and 36 programs include the interface code to the IBM Net anddirect point-to-point connections between trading partners in the baseproduct.andP;  Expedite 400 is a program that enables AS/400 users to send andreceive EDI transactions, AS/400 files and free-format messages, andinterfaces to IBM expEDIte/Direct in the network.andP;  Expedite/36 does the samefor System 36 users, files and messages.andP;  Expedite/PC enables an IBM personalcomputer program to communicate with the IBM information exchange electronicmailbox, enabling users to send and receive EDI formatted data, MS-DOS filesor messages, and provides &quot;easy- to-use&quot; functions for creating, editing,viewing and storing notes and messages.andP;  And IBM hasn't completely forgotten9370 users - if you turn your 9370 into an SNA host, Expedite/CICS enablesMVS or DOS/VSE SNA hosts to communicate with its Network using the LU 6.2protocol, enabling 3270 terminal users to send, receive and manage electronicdata interchange files, and also enables leased-line-attached hosts toreceive messages from one or more users continuously, as soon as they aresent by a Trading Partner.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
