(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Navy analyst convicted ofspying for Israel has begun refusing food as a protest againstfederal authorities allegedly blocking delivery of his letters, hisfather says.   Jonathan Jay Pollard, sentenced last year to life in prisonwithout parole, started his hunger strike Friday and is taking onlywater, said his father, Morris Pollard.   The 32-year-old federal inmate says he's protesting federalauthorities' blocking delivery of his letters from prison,prohibiting visits by his attorney and mistreating his convictedwife, Morris Pollard said Monday.   ``We tried to talk him out of it, and he said no, he's going togo ahead with it,'' said Pollard, a biology professor at theUniversity of Notre Dame. ``He feels he's reached the end of hispatience.''   His son has been in regular contact by telephone, he said.   The younger Pollard is imprisoned at a maximum-security federalpenitentiary at Marion, Ill. He was transferred last month from amedical facility for convicts at Springfield, Mo., said Pollard.   Since then, letters have been diverted to Naval Intelligence inWashington for security checks, but then never forwarded toaddressees, the elder Pollard said.   ``I know that he sent me letters a month ago, he told me on thephone,'' he said, adding that they had not arrived.   Pollard said his son was also protesting inadequate medicaltreatment for his wife, Anne Henderson Pollard, also convicted andimprisoned. Jonathan Pollard complained, too, that he has not beenallowed a visit by his attorney for nearly a year, his father said.   Randy Davis, executive assistant at the Marion prison, did notreturn calls for comment Monday and today. A Navy spokesman inWashington, Lt. Brian Cullen, said this morning the Navy had noimmediate comment.   Jonathan Pollard was charged in 1985 with passing classifieddocuments to Israeli agents. His wife was sentenced to a five-yearterm for her role in the operation. He was arrested in Washingtonoutside the Israeli embassy, where he was seeking refuge.</TEXT></DOC>
