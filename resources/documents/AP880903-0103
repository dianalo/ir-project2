DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan warned Saturdaythat he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him thatdoes not contain a work requirement.   ``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president saidin a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20miles north of here.   Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, saidthat requiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but hesaid such requirements should be controlled by state and localwelfare officials, not the federal government.   Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of hisadministration's economic record, saying Friday's unemploymentfigures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above thelowest it's been in 14 years.''   The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3per cent, which was a 14-year low.   ``But there are still some Americans whom our expansion haspassed by _ those caught in the welfare trap,'' he said.   To deal with this, he said, his administration launched aprogram encouraging states to come up with their own plans to getpeople off the welfare rolls.   ``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposedwidespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good oldcommon sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' thepresident said.   ``Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfarereform and I have a message for them,'' he said. ``I will notaccept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making peopleindependent of welfare.''   A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it aSenate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and aHouse-approved measure that does not.   ``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''the president said. ``If Congress presents me with a bill thatreplaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity ofself-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans onwelfare, I will use my veto pen.''   Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better offtoday than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gottenworse.''   The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomesadjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 yearsago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decadeago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.   The House bill, with training and education programs as well ashealth and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who workbetter off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman ofthe Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance andunemployment compensation.   ``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,but those requirements should be controlled by state and localofficials who administer our welfare programs, not federalbureaucrats,'' Downey said.</TEXT></DOC>
