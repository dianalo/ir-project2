Envoy</HEAD><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Speakers at a rally mourning the deathsof hundreds killed in a 1978 South African army strike on a blacknationalist camp Thursday urged the United Nations to replace itsenvoy in Namibia.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perezde Cuellar said South African forces in Namibia should be confinedto their barracks as soon as possible and called on Pretoria torestrain police there.   Supporters of the guerrilla South-West Africa People'sOrganization rallied at Katatura, the black township outside theterritorial capital of Windhoek, and called for the immediatereplacement of U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari.   They accused Ahtisaari, a Finn, of incompetence for agreeing torelease South African troops to fight an April guerrilla incursionfrom Angola that nearly derailed U.N. plans to hold independenceelections in November.   Two Irish U.N. monitors were the only policemen visible at therally of 1,000.   State radio reported ``visible tension'' when 5,000 peoplerallied in northern Ongwediva. The town is near the fortifiedmilitary base of Oshakati in northern Namibia, where more than 300men, mostly guerrillas, have been killed in a month's fighting.   In Windhoek, 40 youths picketed the U.N. police post, carryingsigns demanding the United Nations immediately take overadministration of the territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters Thursday thatPerez de Cuellar expressed to South African Ambassador Jeremy B.Shearar his ``grave concern'' about Namibia.   At a Wednesday meeting, Perez de Cuellar cited charges ofbrutality and intimidation and urged ``everything be done torestrain the conduct of the South African police.''   He also said South African defense forces ``should be confinedto barracks now, as soon as possible.''   In his turn, Shearar warned 300 to 350 guerrillas likely wouldtry to infiltrate into Namibia on Wednesday and Thursday. TheUnited Nations had no such indications, Giuliani said.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said he was gratifiedto learn there had been no massive overnight incursion.   Pretoria says the guerrillas violated the U.N. peace plan.Guerrilla leaders, who were not signatories to the plan agreed bySouth Africa, Cuba and Angola, said they crossed the border becausethey believed the United Nations had set up bases for them innorthern Namibia.   After negotiations, most infiltrators returned to Angola and itwas agreed South African forces would return to barracks by May 13.But Perez de Cuellar wants that timetable shortened, Giuiliani said.   Pretoria agreed to give independence to Namibia in exchange forthe removal from Angola of 50,000 Cuban troops helping thatgovernment fight right-wing rebels backed by the United States andSouth Africa.   Thursday's anniversary is called Cassinga Day after the Angolantown South African troops attacked 150 miles north of the borderwith Namibia.   The guerrilla organization says South African paratrooperskilled 582 Namiban refugees camping at Cassinga, including 120children. Pretoria says Cassinga was the guerrillas' mainoperational base and about 1,000 guerrillas and six of its soldiersdied.</TEXT></DOC>
