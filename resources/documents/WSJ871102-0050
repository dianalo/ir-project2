In intensive budget talks that began a week ago between congressional leaders and President Reagan, the negotiators have explored almost every crevice of the trillion-dollar federal budget for places to cut spending. They have even examined Social Security benefits, though the president and most members of Congress say the huge pension program is off limits.    This week, negotiators are likely to look beyond the particulars and try to agree on a set of overarching priorities -- a task that has eluded them so far. The Democrats, who control Congress, and the Republicans and President Reagan remain far apart on the outlines of the deficit-cutting package that they were compelled to seek by the stock market's recent drop.    The framework of the plan is important because a budget is as much a political statement as a document that changes the law. Each party will try to impose its priorities on that outline.    Both sides do agree that the package should be at least large enough to avert an automatic, across-the-board $23 billion spending cut in federal programs that is scheduled to go into effect Nov. 20 under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. What's more, the participants increasingly believe they should compose a bigger budget-cutting plan and put it in place for two years rather than a single year, if that is feasible.    But comity breaks down on other major issues, especially taxes. Democrats believe the package should consist half of spending cuts and half of tax increases. The Reagan administration wants more spending cuts, especially from nonmilitary programs. In addition, the Democrats are resisting selling government assets to raise revenue because they produce one-time gains -- and often losses in the long run. Administration officials believe that user fees and asset sales should be counted as revenue increases.    &quot;What we're talking about is $12 billion in revenues and $12 billion in cuts. . . . We have to establish that there will be a 50-50 split,&quot; Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee said yesterday on CBS-News's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; &quot;If you're going to talk about more cuts, you're going to see House members begin not to recommend the conference report.&quot;    &quot;If that's what we're talking about, I don't think we're going to make a deal,&quot; responded New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. &quot;There's clearly a misunderstanding on the revenue side.&quot;    More than a week ago, Treasury Secretary James Baker told House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) that they had &quot;common ground&quot; over a 50-50 package of revenue increases and spending cuts. Republicans have since backed off that offer, declaring that it was misunderstood by the speaker.    In the meantime, the two sides are discussing various spending-cut options. High on the list is a two-year freeze of both military and nonmilitary spending at the levels in fiscal 1987, which ended Sept. 30. The freeze would place separate limits on the total amount that could be spent in fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989 for the annually appropriated accounts in all military and nonmilitary programs. Each limit would be allowed to rise slightly, however, to pay for inflation-adjusted salary increases.    The negotiators also are looking at options to trim $5 billion to $10 billion from Medicare and farm-subsidy programs in the current fiscal year. Farm target prices, which determine the size of cropsubsidy payments, could be slated for reductions, aides say, and payments to doctors and hospitals under Medicare, which provides health insurance for the elderly, might be restricted.    Federal pension programs also are being considered for trimming. Unemployment insurance, veterans' benefits, and military and civilian pensions, other than Social Security, could have their annual cost-of-living increases curtailed or eliminated.    The negotiators have implicitly decided not to tamper with benefits for a range of poverty programs such as aid to families with dependent children and food stamps.    The negotiators haven't dwelled on tax increases, though they have plenty of options to choose from. The House last week passed, and the Senate has pending, separate tax-increase bills totaling about $12 billion each for the current fiscal year.    But Secretary Baker has told his fellow participants that he is constrained by the president to obtain significant spending cuts in nonmilitary programs and to accept no more than $10 billion of tax increases. The greater the nonmilitary spending cuts, he has said, the more flexible the president is likely to be on taxes. </TEXT></DOC>
