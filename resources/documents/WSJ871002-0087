It has taken the Jardine group 3 1/2 years to make another decisive move overseas. But unlike the &quot;Bermuda bombshell,&quot; as the local press dubs the earlier incident, the group's latest plan -- to acquire a 20% stake in Bear Stearns Cos. of the U.S. -- caused hardly a ripple in Hong Kong.    The stock market rose yesterday after waking up to the news, which didn't even make the front pages of most local newspapers. Echoing a widespread sentiment among analysts, Anthony Bellingan of S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd. said the $390 million overseas investment, the biggest ever made by the Jardine group, &quot;wasn't unexpected.&quot;    Such equanimity suggests that Hong Kong may have grown used to the touchy idea of local companies investing abroad. These corporate moves often are cited, perhaps unfairly, as a sign of shaky confidence in this colony's 1997 transition from British to Chinese sovereignty. But lately, many major concerns have managed to embark on overseas expansion without stirring controversy.    Heading the list is Hongkong Bank, which is buying out the minority shareholders of Marine Midland Bank, its principal U.S. subsidiary, for $800 million. John Gray, a Hongkong Bank executive director, confirmed that the bank is shopping for a European acquisition but maintains that no specific target is in sight yet. &quot;Europe is where the gap is in our global operations,&quot; he said.    A growing number of other companies are toying with the idea of overseas expansion. Analysts said many local companies have little alternative to investment abroad, because they have grown so big that it seems prudent, and necessary, to diversify outside the territory. The question is whether ambitious overseas plans will pay off.    &quot;For companies that already have enormous investments in Hong Kong, looking overseas is a logical step,&quot; said Stephen Clark of Citicorp International Ltd. &quot;But it's a difficult step because it isn't done traditionally,&quot; added the merchant banker, who has acted as adviser in some of these transactions. &quot;It's an entirely new adventure.&quot;    Jardine is among the exceptions, in that it has some experience in overseas investments. But those investments have produced mixed results.    Jardine's biggest foreign holding previously had been a 51.7% stake in Rennies Consolidated Holdings Ltd., a Johannesburg travel and transportation concern. That investment, which was sold for $180.1 million in 1983 to help Jardine reduce its heavy debt, was a profitable one.    But Jardine recently experienced setbacks in energy investments in the U.S., which led to a write-off of 65 million Hong Kong dollars ($8.3 million) two years ago.    For Jardine, which has just made a dramatic comeback from several years of financial problems, the investment in Bear Stearns offers ample evidence of the group's recovery. Besides, the tie-up with a major U.S. brokerage fits in with Jardine's ambition to become a major force in the global financial services field.    Some analysts maintained, however, that without control over Bear Stearns's equity or its board, Jardine has merely made a passive investment in which it has little significant influence.    P.J. Collins, a Jardine Matheson director, said the criticism isn't fair. He maintained that Jardine, if necessary, would be able to exert sufficient influence with three directors on the Bear Stearns board. And he said such influence isn't likely to be necessary &quot;because one doesn't go into an investment expecting problems.&quot;    &quot;I wouldn't call it a passive investment,&quot; he said. &quot;I would call it a sensible investment.&quot;    With a 20% stake in Bear Stearns, Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd., a Jardine Matheson affiliate, would become the second-biggest shareholder after Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., the partnership that owns 45% of the U.S. brokerage. After the transaction's scheduled completion in November, Jardine would have the right to name three representatives to Bear Stearns's board, expanding it to 29 directors. </TEXT></DOC>
