Windows and doors are closed, thealarm system activated at all times. They sleep in the same room, the childrenin sleeping bags on the floor.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CAMBRIAN RAPE VICTIM SEEKS TO LEAVE SAN JOSEFUND STARTED TO HELP HER, OTHER VICTIMS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Now, a San Jose woman who lives near Hill's Cambrian Park neighborhood hasstarted a fund to help Hill and other rape victims who need a safe place or achance to get back on their feet.;   &quot;I kept reading about the Cambrian rapistsituation and feeling that we as the community have to do something,&quot; saidSharon Cameron, a counselor who works on healing attitudinal problems. &quot;Ithaunted me until I could think of something to do to help.&quot;;   Cameron wasable to get a message to Hill and found that she didn't have the money to moveto another area.;   Hill, 45, had given up hope of moving her children tosafety after the only serious potential buyer for her home in five monthsbacked out when he learned she was raped there.;   Until this year, Hill, whois separated from her husband, had relied on money from baby-sitting and oddjobs to pay for daily expenses and groceries. But parents of several childrensaid her services would no longer be needed after Hill came forward with herstory in May of being raped at knifepoint in her Cambrian home in 1988.;  Since then, the rapist has stalked her in the neighborhood, tried to break inafter pulling the main power switch and called several times to say, &quot;I'mbaaaaaack.&quot; Her phone lines were cut Sept. 3.;   The new fund won't help Hillimmediately. It was opened at the Downey Savings andamp; Loan on Blossom Hill Roadin Los Gatos with two individual donations of $50 each. But the YWCA RapeCrisis Center in San Jose has agreed to administer it, and the bank is waivingall fees.;   &quot;I was excited when Sharon Cameron approached me,&quot; said LindaKrafty, branch manager for the bank, who matched Cameron's $50 seed donation.&quot;People always put out rewards to help catch the criminal, but nothing for thevictims themselves.&quot;;   &quot;This is not just about one woman and her children,&quot;Cameron said. &quot;It's about the vulnerability of the community. She's Mrs.Middle America . . . She wasn't walking down a dark street or an alley in thecrummy part of town. She was in her home, the American dream.&quot;;   If the firstpriority of the fund will be to help Hill relocate, its goal is to provide astanding account to help rape victims with everything from clothes to a busticket.;   Women who have been raped often have to leave their clothes at thehospital as evidence. In one recent case, a teen-age girl from an impoverishedfamily had to leave her only pair of shoes as well, said Sandy Davis, programmanager of the Rape Crisis Center.;   &quot;Often, we've had to send (women) homein hospital clothes,&quot; she said.;   Another time, a young mother couldn'thandle going back to her bedroom, where she was raped. It wasn't until rapecrisis counselors came up with the money for a new bedspread and sheets thatthe woman could return.;   For some it's not that easy.;   &quot;What do you dowhen a woman is raped in her own home?&quot; said Jackye McClure, director of theRape Crisis Center. &quot;Staying in that neighborhood is a frightening reality forsomeone who has just been raped . . . The fund will help provide them with arespite.&quot;;   Still, accepting the help will be hard, Hill said.;   &quot;I'mashamed that I need this kind of financial support,&quot; Hill said Friday. &quot;Butit's the only way I'm going to be able to get out of here. My house has beenon the market since May.&quot;;   Hill, who vowed to return to testify if herrapist is caught, said she is more concerned about her children than herself.;  &quot;No family should have to go through this,&quot; she said. &quot;The kids no longerfeel safe at home, even with the alarm. I know that I will heal, but mychildren are young and don't know how to fight this kind of battle. And theyshouldn't have to.&quot;; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; Donations to the fund will beaccepted in person at the Blossom Hill branch of Downey Savings andamp; Loan, orchecks may be mailed to SAFE (Sexual Assault Fund for Emergencies) in care ofLinda Krafty, Downey Savings andamp; Loan, 14184 Blossom Hill Road, Los Gatos 95032.Checks should be made payable to SAFE.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LINDA GOLDSTON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910922  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  806  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 22, 199100266077,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
