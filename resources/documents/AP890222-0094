Salah Khalaf, Yasser Arafat's No. 2 man, spoke on a videotapesmuggled into Israel from Tunis, Tunisia. The tape was shown at aMiddle East peace symposium in Jerusalem.   In an unusual direct appeal to Israel, Khalaf, known by his nomde guerre Abu Iyad, assured his audience the PLO recognizes theJewish state and deplores violence.   ``We have arrived at a truth that we hope the Israeli leaderswill arrive at before it is too late. This is the truth which saysthat two peoples and two states must coexist in this land,'' Khalafsaid.   ``All other matters are open to discussion, our covenant andyours can be discussed,'' Khalaf said.   The ``convenant'' refers to the Palestinian National Charter.   Khalaf called for direct PLO-Israeli talks before aninternational Middle East peace conference proposed most recently bythe Soviet Union.   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and refuses tohold direct negotiations with it.   The 15-minute videotape was screened at a symposium on theArab-Israeli conflict organized by the International Center forPeace in the Middle East, a private Tel Aviv think tank headed byformer Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban of the Labor Party.   The appeal followed demands by liberal Israelis that the PLO dealdirectly with Israel instead of seeking Western support for itspositions. The United States opened a dialogue with the PLO inDecember after Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.   ``The people of Israel have a fear that Arafat is addressingEurope and the U.S. State Department, and not the real or imaginaryfears of the Israeli people,'' Shlomo Avineri, an Israeli politicalscientist, told the symposium earlier. ``I hope he (Arafat) will oneday talk to our people.''   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his refusal tonegotiate with the PLO. ``I see it (the PLO) as a stumbling block onthe road to peace, a very serious obstacle,'' he said on Israel Armyradio in a telephone interview from Paris.   Khalaf, who spoke in Arabic, said the PLO supported a Palestinianstate alongside Israel.   ``The real issue is not negotiations in which Israel seeks thispiece of land and we seek that piece of land. This is a smallgeographic area without much elbow room. We do not seek to have aBerlin Wall or any other wall separating us,'' Khalaf said.   Addressing himself to ``every child in Israel, to every woman andevery man,'' he said the PLO was ``genuine in our desire for astrategic peace, a peace in which we shall bring security andstability to this region.''</TEXT></DOC>
