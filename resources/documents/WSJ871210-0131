Johnston</HL><DD> 12/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><TEXT>   Does the crash mean that a recession is on the way? Some economists think so, arguing that the loss of almost a trillion dollars in paper wealth will postpone consumer spending and delay business investment.    While consumer spending is almost certain to be hit by the crash, the slowdown in goods production that will follow should not drive the economy into a recession. The growing dominance of service industries is making our economy less and less vulnerable to downturns. Our expanding service sector means that unless goods production tumbles precipitously, a recession is not just around the corner, and that if it comes, it will be short and shallow.    Throughout the postwar era, service industries have been growing faster than goods production. By the year 2000, according to Hudson Institute projections, services (including government) will constitute some 75% of the economy, up from 70% today and 56% in 1947.    Employment and production in service industries are much more stable than in the goods economy. Because services generally cannot be stored, no inventory cycle triggers wide swings in production. Since 1956, service-sector gross national product has never declined, with real growth ranging from 0.7% to 5.7%. The goods economy, on the other hand, has been in recession in six of the 31 years, with growth swinging wildly from 4.8% to 10%.    In recent years, service employment actually has grown during recessions rather than declining along with jobs in goods production. According to a study by Geoffrey H. Moore at Columbia University, jobs in private service industries grew by an average of 1% during the four recessions between 1969 and 1982, while those in government grew by 2%. Employment in goods production slipped by an average of 7.9% during these downturns.    As the deep recession of 1982 dramatically illustrated, the business cycle has not been eliminated despite the shift to services. But even when a 20% prime rate drove the goods economy into the tank in 1981, service employment kept chugging ahead. Ultimately this growth in service jobs powered the economy throughout the record-breaking recovery.    There are two reasons that the loss of goods-production jobs should be much less severe now than it was in 1982. First, unlike 1982, the dollar is continuing to fall, boosting the prospects of U.S. exporters. To some degree, jobs created by goods exporters will offset job losses caused by reduced spending by domestic consumers. Second, most manufacturers have already savagely trimmed their corporate and production staffs over the past several years, in an effort to improve their international competitiveness. There is simply less fat left to trim. Barring a spectacular loss of consumer confidence, the relatively modest job losses ahead in manufacturing should be counterbalanced by continued service-job growth. As a result the economy should plod ahead in 1988, rather than enter a recession.    Beyond the immediate prospects for the economy, the continuing shift to service employment means that future recessions are likely to be less severe than previous ones. By the year 2000, the job gains that will occur during typical recessions in the expanded service and government sectors will come close to matching the job losses in the shrunken goods sector. If employment changes in the goods, services and government sectors parallel the pattern set between 1969 and 1982, for example, a typical recession occurring in 2000 would cause total employment to drop by only 0.6%, compared with average job losses of 1.6% during the recessions of 1969-82.    The moderating effect of the shift to services will tend also to shorten recessions and prolong recoveries. The average recession prior to 1929 lasted 21 months, compared with only 11 months since 1948. The average recovery, on the other hand, grew from 24 to 48 months. Other factors played a part, but the stable service sector and the demand for goods from the growing numbers of service workers have helped to lengthen recoveries and trim recessions.    Some economists have expressed doubts about the strength of the current recovery because it has relied so much on increases in service employment. But the boom in such employment is a measure of the economy's strength, promising smoother, more sustained growth in the years ahead and insurance against a near-term recession.    ---   Mr. Johnston is vice president of special projects and a senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute.
