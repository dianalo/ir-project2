The company estimates the discovery contains reserves in excess of 20 million barrels of oil.    Canadian Hunter is 87%-owned by Noranda Inc. of Toronto. At the end of 1987, it had proven and probable reserves of oil and natural-gas liquids of 75 million barrels and natural-gas reserves of 1.34 trillion cubic feet. BP America, a unit of London-based British Petroleum Co., operates in Canada through the Webb International Ltd. unit, of Calgary, Alberta.    Canadian Hunter said output is slated to start in July, and production rates from the reserves found to date could range from 5,000 to 7,000 barrels of oil a day. The actual field-production rate will depend on the results of further reservoir analysis and the approval of an allowable rate by British Columbia.    Canadian Hunter said nine of 13 wells drilled in the area found oil, and that further drilling is going ahead to determine the size of the discovery.    Earl Hawkes, manager of exploration operations, said the project is economically viable even with low oil prices because of the high quality of the reserves and low production costs. A recently introduced British Columbia government program, which would eliminate royalties for three years on wells drilled and capable of production before June 1989, will also benefit the project, he said.    Canadian Hunter and BP America each have a 50% interest in the oil-field venture. The companies said the venture, formed in 1985, has spent about 200 million Canadian dollars (US$166.1 million) on exploration activities in the region. The partners control about 150,000 acres within the vicinity of the discovery.    Canadian Hunter said it is the operator for the venture. </TEXT></DOC>
