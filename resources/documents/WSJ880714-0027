The bill, which is stripped of a plant-closings provision that prompted a Reagan veto in May, is now considered to have a good chance of winning the president's signature.

Stocks, bonds and the dollar were buoyed initially by Greenspan's remarks, though bonds ended lower.    ---   CBS replaced the longtime head of its broadcast operations, Gene Jankowski, and named news division President Howard Stringer to the job.
