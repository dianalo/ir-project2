When a railroadalleges an employee human factor as the primary cause or contributing causeof an accident, it would be required to notify the employee involved/implicatedthat the railroad has made such allegations and that the employee has theright to submit a statement to FRA concerning the accident. This actionis taken in order to implement section 24 of the Rail Safety ImprovementAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-342), which provides that ``if a railroad, inreporting an accident or incident under the Accident Reports Act (45 U.S.C.38 <T3>et seq.</T3>), assigns human error as a cause of the accident or incident,such report shall include, at the option of each employee whose error isalleged, a statement by such employee explaining any factors the employeealleges contributed to the accident or incident.''

Section 24 of that Act provides that ``(i)f a railroad,in reporting an accident or incident under the Accident Reports Act (45U.S.C. 38 <T3>et seq.</T3>), assigns human error as a cause of the accident or incident,such report shall include, at the option of each employee whose error isalleged, a statement by such employee explaining any factor the employeealleges contributed to the accident or incident.''The legislative history of this provision indicates that Congress intendedfor FRA to allow submission of the employee's statement without delayingthe submission of the railroad's accident report and for FRA to file theemployee's statement with the applicable report from the railroad. (See``Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference,'' in theConference Report to accompany S. 1539, H.R. Rept. No. 100-637 (100th Cong.2d Sess.).) That is in fact FRA's practice today and has been its practicefor many years. The principal purpose of this provision appears to be threefold:(1) Ensuring that employees are aware of this right, (2) ensuring thatemployees are notified of the instances where the right may be execised,and (3) institutionalizing the practice in regulations. The central requirement of the proposed rule is that the railroad providewritten notification to any employee whom the railroad alleges to havebeen responsible, at least in part, for an act, omission, or conditioncited by the railroad as a primary or contributing cause of a certain typeof employee human factor accident, informing the employee of the relevantallegations and of his or her right to file a statement with FRA. A copyof the proposed standard form for notification of employees is appendedto this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Section 209 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) providesthat ``(t)he Secretary shall include in, or make applicable to, any railroadsafety * * * regulation issued under this title a civil penalty for violationthereof * * *.'' The RSIA increases the maximum penalty for violation ofa regulation issued under the FRSA from $2,500 to $10,000 and, in certaincircumstances, $20,000. See 53 FR 28594-28598 (1988). The final rule willinclude a revised penalty schedule for Part 225 reflecting the higher maximumpenalties now available and adding entries for the new section proposedherein. See the recent revisions to the penalty provision and penalty scheduleof Part 225 required by the RSIA. 53 FR 28594, 28601 (1988). Because FRA'spenalty schedules are statements of policy, notice and comment are notrequired to revisions to those schedules. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Nevertheless,interested parties are welcome to submit their views on what penaltiesmay be appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>FRA has evaluated this proposed rule in accordance with its proceduresfor ensuring full consideration of the potential environmental impactsof FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act andrelated directives. This notice meets the criteria that establish thisas a non-major action for environmental purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures </ITAG>This proposed rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policiesand procedures. It is considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 but significant under the DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034);February 26, 1979). This rule will not have any significant direct or indirect economic impactfor four reasons. First, its requirements apply only in the case of a railequipment accident/incident that the reporting railroad alleges to haveresulted from an employee human factor. FRA statistics, based on the railroads'reports, show that there were 855 such accidents in 1987. Second, compliancewith the notification requirements should not be difficult because it isaccomplished by filling in a short standard form supplied by the agency.Third, the Railroad Employee Accident Statement provided for in the ruleis also to be written on a short standard form, partially completed bythe railroad. Fourth, the Statement is submitted at the employee's option;employees who have no interest in filling it out are not required to doso. The benefit of the rule is that employees are informed of their rights,which is likely to result in FRA's receiving more complete informationon employees' views of the causes of accidents. The cost to the railroadsfor completing, mailing or delivering, and maintaining these records isinsignificant. Additionally, we estimate that the cost to the employeesis insignificant. For these reasons, a draft regulatory evaluation hasnot been prepared; however, the agency invites comments on the costs expectedto be incurred.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>FRA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. There are no direct or indirecteconomic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations.State rail agencies remain free to participate in the administration ofFRA's rules, but are not required to do so.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that theproposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average fifteen minutes per employee notification and an average offifteen minutes per employee statement, with an estimated total annualburden (based on an estimated 832 notifications and 416 statements) of312 hours. All of these estimates include time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
