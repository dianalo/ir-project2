In the large U-limit we derive aneffective interaction between charge carriers by integrating out antiferromagneticfluctuations due to Cu-spins. It is shown that the normal state of chargecarriers becomes unstable against singlet, d-wave, triplet, and singlet,extended s-wave superconductivity with decreasing temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
