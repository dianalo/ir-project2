More than half the foreigners working at companies investigatedby the Labor Ministry between Oct. 16 and Nov. 16 were found to beworking illegally, a recent report showed.   Poor working conditions and the risk of deportation haven'tdiscouraged the wave of workers from less wealthy Asian nations, norhave wages that are low by Japanese standards although, because ofthe strong yen, high in the foreign workers' own countries.   The Japanese government, so far, has responded to the surge inforeign labor with plans to open its doors wider to foreignprofessionals. But it has reaffirmed a ban on manual laborers,provoking a national debate over the merits of internationalizingJapan's closed society.   While government and private groups study the problem, the influxof illegal foreign workers continues to grow.   In 1987, the Labor Ministry deported 11,307 foreigners forworking illegally. In the first half of this year, Japanese policeand immigration authorities arrested 7,196 foreigners for workingillegally, up from 5,802 in the first half of 1987.   But those numbers compare with police estimates that about 70,000illegal foreign workers are in Japan.   About half the illegal workers are men.   Women, often recruited by crime syndicates, long have flocked toJapan to work, often legally, as ``entertainers.'' Human rightsgroups say the gangs that control Japan's underworld often forcethem into working as prostitutes.   Since 1985, however, the number of illegal male workers in Japanhas ballooned as unskilled workers from the Philippines, Bangladeshand Pakistan find ready employment, Labor Ministry figures show.   In the ministry's investigation, of 202 foreigners working at15,796 companies, 111 were working illegally, Kyodo News Servicereported.   It said 54 of the illegal workers were from Bangladesh, 36 fromPakistan, 13 from India, two each from Ghana, Taiwan and Thailandand one each from the Philippines and South Korea.   Most of the clandestine laborers worked long hours with novacations for low wages, having overstayed tourist visas afterfinding work at construction sites or in small metal working,chemical or food processing factories, the report said.   Despite the government ban, firms that hire foreign manualworkers are not penalized. A shortage of Japanese willing to domanual labor encourages them to employ foreigners, who often arereluctant to complain of poor treatment due to the risk ofdeportation, said Eiko Shinotsuka, a labor economist at OchanomizuUniversity in Tokyo.   Both men and women working illegally are vulnerable toexploitation because of their illegal status, said Yaeko Takeoka, alawyer familiar with the problems of clandestine workers.   Japanese employees in the metal working industry receive averagehourly wages of 2,150 yen, or about $17.20. Clandestine workersreceive hourly wages of 500 to 700 yen, or $4 to $5.60, LaborMinistry figures show.   But a few months of even low wages in Japanese yen amount to afortune for migrant workers due to the lower cost of living in otherAsian countries. Japan's average per capita income is about $17,000,compared with $550 in the Philippines, $113 in Bangladesh and $360in Pakistan.   By living together in small apartments to save on expenses, theclandestine workers manage to send about half their wages home totheir families. Isolated in a society where they must constantlyhide from police and immigration officials, few plan to stay inJapan indefinitely.   ``They just come for short stays,'' Shinotsuka said.   Economists say the influx of illegal laborers is unlikely toabate because Japan's 2.4 percent unemployment rate reflects a trendtoward shortages of workers in certain industries.   A recent report by the National Council for Development of anEconomic Structure of the 21st Century predicted that Japan willface a shortage of 2.7 million workers by the year 2000 if currenteconomic trends continue.   The council recommended that Japan accept unskilled andsemi-skilled foreign workers and suggested establishment of a systemto prevent exploitation of ``guest workers.''   Numerous commentaries also have urged that Japan welcome its lessaffluent neighbors.   ``In Japan, we don't accept political asylum and we turn ourbacks on immigrants. Maybe, in the short run, this is a wise policyin avoiding problems. However, can we say this policy is right overthe long run?'' wrote commentator Yunosuke Ohkura in The Japan Times.   Noting that Japanese believe they are ``unique and thereforesuperior,'' Mitsunobu Sugiyama of the University of Tokyo said in arecent article in the Japan Quarterly that ``constant contact withthe people of other nations on this very personal level would domuch to open Japanese eyes and help them better understand the restof the world.''   A recent report by a Labor Ministry advisory panel, however,concluded that foreign manual laborers were undesirable. Theirunfamiliarity with Japanese language and customs, it said, couldcause social conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
