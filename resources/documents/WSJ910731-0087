You are hereby commanded to produce the thingsidentified on the attached schedule before the Subcommitteeon Economic and Commercial Law of the Judiciary Committee . .. of which the Honorable Jack Brooks is chairman . . . onWednesday, July 31, at the hour of 9 a.m.                                                                                                          The hour of 9 a.m. will pass into history today withoutthe Honorable Jack Brooks receiving the above-quotedsubpoena's unprecedented demands for executive-branchmaterial. In refusing to turn over his Attorney General toMr. Brooks, the President could simply say that bear-baiting,cockfights and other avid congressional pastimes aren't onthe presidential list of fully accredited sports.   The subpoenaed material is hardly the usual stuff thatignites the congressional torches. The document is a legalopinion written in 1989 for Dick Thornburgh by hisconstitutional lawyers in Justice's Office of Legal Counsel.It explains why the President has the power under theConstitution and international law to send FBI agents toforeign countries to apprehend fugitives who refuseextradition.   President Bush and Justice are on solid ground that thereis legal authority to catch fugitives. And they are on firmfooting that executive privilege and the attorney-clientprivilege protect the confidentiality of the legal advice thePresident and Attorney General get from Justice lawyers.   Don Edwards and other liberals in Congress argue that theFBI capture power violates &quot;customary international law.&quot; Infact, as Justice officials have told Congress, there is along history of grabbing international fugitives when anothercountry refuses extradition. Also, customary law iscircularly defined as custom based on what importantcountries do, and presumably that includes a U.S. President'sorder to apprehend a Manuel Noriega.   Congress would do defense lawyers fighting such arrests abig favor if it forced the release of the memo outliningJustice's legal views. Somehow we doubt Congress would wantto free General Noriega or the pair of Mexicans the U.S.seized to stand trial for the torture-murder of a DEA agent.   Because we've all been down this muddy road before,there's reason to think the subpoena &quot;confrontation&quot; haslittle to do with policy and a lot to do with Congressplaying politics. The subpoena drags Mr. Thornburgh into amedia swamp just as he's preparing to run against a Democratfor an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania. There may be agrandiose effort to hold him in contempt when he refuses tocomply with the subpoena. One sure sign of politics: Earlierthis month the Brooks committee hectored an empty chair whenMr. Thornburgh refused to show up for a hearing thatRepublican committee members warned was a political ambush.   Criminalizing separation of powers is a familiarcongressional tactic. In 1983, Theodore Olson, the head ofthe Reagan Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel,dared protect privileged EPA documents from a similarcongressional subpoena. Congress retaliated; it sicked aspecial prosecutor on Mr. Olson, a torture that lastedseveral years before the prosecutor finally admitted that Mr.Olson committed no crime.   If Congress doesn't want the FBI to apprehend fugitives,it can pass a law. Until then, President Bush is right todefend the policy, confidentiality for his advisers and theconstitutional guarantee of executive privilege againstCongress.</TEXT></DOC>
