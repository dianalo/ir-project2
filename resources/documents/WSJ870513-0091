The sources estimated the value of the transaction at less than $100 million in convertible preferred stock and other securities. Warner also would assume more than $100 million of Chappell debt, the sources said.    Warner officials declined to comment on the reports, which first appeared in yesterday's Los Angeles Times. Chappell officials didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.    New York-based Chappell is owned by an investor group including Chappell's chief executive officer, Freddy Bienstock, and Wertheim andamp; Co., a New York investment banking firm. The group acquired Chappell from Polygram Records Inc., a unit of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, in 1984 for about $100 million.    Warner, a major producer of recorded music, also operates a music publishing unit, Warner Bros. Music, with copyrights to more than 250,000 songs, including some written by such artists as Michael Jackson and Madonna. One analyst estimated Warner's 1986 music publishing revenue at about $110 million.    In 1984, Warner dropped plans to merge its recorded music operations with Polygram Records under opposition from U.S. government officials.    Chappell has copyrights to more than 400,000 songs, including some composed by such artists as George Gershwin and Elvis Presley. Industry sources didn't disclose revenue of closely held Chappell.    The sources described the proposed acquisition as a &quot;good fit.&quot; Warner Bros. Music is a stronger distributor of published music in the U.S., while Chappell is more established in international markets, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
