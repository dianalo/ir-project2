The symbolic clock, the anti-nuclear publication said, hadpreviously been even closer to nuclear destruction: at three minutesto midnight.   But on the eve of the fifth meeting between President Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, experts differ on whether theINF pact actually made the world a safer place to live.   President-elect George Bush, who will participate in theReagan-Gorbachev meeting, hopes to expand on the INF treaty as heeventually engages Gorbachev in negotiations on strategic nuclearforces and conventional armies in Europe.   The INF pact was a milestone: it was the first U.S.-Soviet armscontrol deal since the second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty,signed in 1979.   It was the first treaty to eliminate an entire class of newlydeveloped weapons. Other arms treaties had merely set ceilings thatled to the elimination of some obsolete systems.   ``After so many steps in the wrong direction, the INF Treaty is astep in the right one,'' the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said.``For the first time the United States and the Soviet Union haveagreed to dismantle and ban a whole category of nuclear weapons.''   Rep. Les Aspin, R-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said the INF pact pushed the Atlantic Alliance ``down theslippery slope toward European denuclearization.''   But former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said ``the Sovietcuts do not reduce in any significant manner the Soviet capacity toattack Europe with nuclear weapons and ... increase the Sovietconventional threat to Europe'' because the Warsaw Pact has moretanks and ground troops that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Kissinger said Gorbachev wanted the treaty for ``the calculatedpurpose of weakening ties between the United States and WesternEurope and between Germany and the Atlantic Alliance.''   Joseph Nye, a Harvard University professor who was a principalforeign policy adviser to Democratic presidential candidate MichaelDukakis, said ``the INF treaty in and of itself is not terriblysignificant. Eliminating that number of weapons, 4 percent of thetotal (of all nuclear arms), is not a major accomplishment.''   ``The significance is more political, symbolizing the ability ofthe two nations to get together,'' said Nye. ``In that sense, thetreaty left the world a safer place because it was a step towardjoint management of nuclear weapons.''   The INF pact, ratified by the U.S. Senate and the Sovietparliament in May and formally exchanged at the Moscow summit lastsummer, called for the United States and the Soviet Union to destroyall their ground-based missiles with ranges of 300-3,400 miles _ 859weapons for America and 1,836 for the Soviet Union. It does notapply to air- or sea-launched nuclear missiles in this rangecategory.   More is going on under INF than missile crunching.   The Soviet and U.S. missiles are being withdrawn and destroyedunder the watchful eyes of teams of inspectors composed largely ofmilitary officers from the two superpowers.   The trust engendered by those contacts is softening the attitudesof some hard-line officers, veterans of the Cold War who have beenthrust to the forefront of the East-West thaw.   The U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency is headed by Brig. Gen. RolandLajoie, a no-nonsense officer who served two tours as a militaryattache in Moscow and was commander of the military liaison officein East Germany when Soviet soldiers shot and killed U.S. Maj.Arthur Nicholson on March 24, 1985.   ``Clearly there was a considerable change in our relationship''since the INF pact was signed, Lajoie said last summer. Much of thesuspicion, he said ``is gone now.''   Lajoie also marveled at being able to go to a base for the mainSoviet medium-range missile, the SS-20. ``That is something I wouldnever have dreamed I could do as a military attache. ... That initself is a startling development,'' he said.   John D. Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies at theliberal Brookings Institution, says Gorbachev should get the creditfor pushing along U.S.-Soviet relations.   The superpower leaders, said Steinbruner, ``have set aconstructive trend. But it has not yet gone far enough to say thatthe world is a safer place.''   He added, ``There is a policy emerging from the Kremlin that, ifcarried out, would make the world a safer place.''   Bruce Weinrod, director of foreign policy studies at theconservative Heritage Foundation, credits the tough policies ofReagan for driving the Soviet Union toward equitable arms controldeals.   ``With Gorbachev, the jury is still out. He has certainly createdmore space inside his country for discussion. ... But it is notclear how far the internal loosening will go,'' Weinrod said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Bryan Brumley covers U.S.-Soviet relations andnational security issues for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
