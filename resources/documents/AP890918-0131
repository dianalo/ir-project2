(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, urging a ``new greening ofAmerica,'' proposed a national tree-planting campaign Monday as alow-cost part of his national clean-air strategy.   He also said he would order special environmental training forPeace Corps representatives abroad, ``to stop pollution before itstarts, and ensure that economic development and environmentalstewardship go hand-in-hand.''   ``Our Peace Corps volunteers are going to help spread the word inthe developing world,'' Bush told an outdoor crowd in front ofMontana's copper-domed capitol at his second stop on a Western triphonoring three states that are marking 100-year anniversaries.   He said that, beginning next year, Peace Corps members would betrained by the Environmental Protection Agency to deal with ``a fullrange of environmental challenges,'' including waste disposal, waterpollution prevention, pesticide management and reforestation.   Earlier, Bush suggested at a similar ceremony in Sioux Falls,S.D., that trees be planted alongside the nation's interstatehighway system as part of a national volunteer tree-planting program.   Referring to trees as ``the oldest, cheapest and most-efficientair purifier on earth,'' Bush declared: ``We need to reforest thisbountiful earth.''   Bush planted trees at ceremonies in Helena and in Sioux Falls,and also was to participate in a similar centennial observation inSpokane, Wash., on Tuesday.   In a separate address to a regional conference of statelegislators in Helena, Bush said the nation's ``teaching andlearning environment'' also needs protection.   Speaking of the two-day education summit he is convening nextweek in Charlottesville, Va., Bush said, ``the plain truth is thatour educational system is not making the grade.''   He told state lawmakers from Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota andSouth Dakota that ``you appropriate the money. You make programspossible. And you often are experts on education.''   Bush also put in a pitch for his crime and anti-drug programs,saying ``we need the states to toughen their laws: Mandatory timefor weapons offenders, no plea-bargaining on guns, the death penaltyfor heinous drug crimes, and more police, prosecutors and prisons.''   Earlier, he told a Sioux Falls audience of several thousandgathered in the municipal arena, ``You in South Dakota know what ittakes to plant a tree. It doesn't take a federal program. It doesn'ttake a new bureaucracy. And it sure doesn't take some fancy newstudy. What it takes is a shovel.''   ``Nature has powerful rejuvenative forces but we need to helpthem along,'' he added.   The Bush administration was expected to make reforestation amajor element of its environmental policy, matching an internationalmovement to preserve the world's rain forests.   By converting carbon dioxide to oxygen, trees can help clean theair as well as counter the so-called ``greenhouse effect,'' in whichan overabundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere speeds globalwarming.   Bush noted that his first effort at planting a tree in acentennial state had been jinxed _ an elm tree he planted inneighboring North Dakota last April.   The elm, transplanted from the White House lawn, turned out to beinfected with several tiny larvae of the gypsy moth _ a leaf-eatinginsect that has devastated elms in many Eastern and some Westernstates.   ``So far, I'm having about as much luck planting as I didfishing,'' Bush quipped.   The larvae were removed from the North Dakota tree _ a descendantof one planted by President John Quincy Adams _ and the tree wassprayed with insecticide.   ``In the middle of this century, we built the interstate highwaysystem, the greatest ground transportation network since Rome,''Bush said. ``Now let's make these corridors beautiful, quieter,greener _ and cleaner.''   ``It's not enough to stop dirtying the air. We've got to clean itup,'' Bush told his audience.   ``Of course, reforestation is only one part of our comprehensiveand sometimes highly technical proposals to clean up America's air.But trees possess a value no high-tech solution will ever match....''   ``Trees can reduce the heat of a summer's day, quiet a highway'snoise, feed the hungry, provide shelter from the wind and warmth inthe winter.''   In comments that seemed to come full circle from Ronald Reagan's1980 observation that trees are a major cause of air pollution, Bushtold his audience ``every tree is a compact between generations.''   Reagan was roundly criticized during the 1980 presidentialcampaign when he said that most atmospheric contamination comes fromnatural rather than manmade processes, and that trees areresponsible for 93 percent of the nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere.Environmentalists said Reagan was confused about nitrous oxide,which comes from decaying plant matter and is not harmful, andnitrogen oxide, which is emitted by coal plants and is a pollutant.   Bush noted that the federal government had planted 340,000 acresof new trees last year. But he said this was a relatively smallamount and ``the real solution is at the grassroots level.''</TEXT></DOC>
