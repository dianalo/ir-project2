The satellite will be launched into orbit late next year by a Chinese three-stage rocket, the Long March 3, and will be the first domestic communications satellite for Asia, said Peter J. Cott, chief executive officer of Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd.    In the past two years, China has signed several agreements to launch other nations' satellites, said Wu Keli, vice president of Great Wall Industry Corp., an affiliate of China's Astronautics Ministry. However, only Sweden has signed a formal contract, he said at a news conference Friday to announce the agreement.    AsiaSat consists of China's CITIC Technology Corp., Britain's Cable and Wireless, and Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa.    China has successfully launched 22 of its own satellites in the past 18 years. Once launched, AsiaSat-1 will provide coverage of China, Korea, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Hong Kong and the Philippines. </TEXT></DOC>
