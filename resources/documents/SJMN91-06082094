As many as 20million women are exposed to substances at work that might affect fetalhealth; at least 15 major corporations, including General Motors, Monsanto andduPont, have fetal protection policies.;    Johnson Controls' battery divisionbarred all fertile women from working with lead and from career paths withjobs that might involve lead exposure, which meant all top-paying jobs. Womenwho wanted access to these jobs had to prove sterility; use of birth controlor celibacy wasn't enough.;    The policy was imposed in 1982, after eightlead-exposed workers had babies; one showed signs of hyperactivity.;    Thecourt ruled that sex-specific fetal-protection rules directly violate thePregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. &quot;Decisions about the welfare of futurechildren must be left to the parents who conceive, bear, support and raisethem rather than to the employers who hire those parents,&quot; Justice HarryBlackmun wrote.;    It was once illegal for a woman to work more than eighthours a day -- for pay. It was a protective law that protected women out ofthe ability to earn a living.;    Most working women are capable of usingbirth control to avoid a dangerous pregnancy; many have had all the childrenthey're going to have. They should not be forced to be sterilized in order tohave a shot at a job with decent pay.;    Employers do have a legitimateconcern about liability. As long as a company complies with safety rules andwarns workers of risks, Blackmun said, &quot;Without negligence, it would bedifficult for a court to find liability on the part of the employer.&quot;;   Unfortunately, courts can find liability in the most unlikely places thesedays. This decision requires courts to tell women who knew the risks and madebad choices: Sorry, you don't get to sue. The right to decide includes theobligation to accept the consequences.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910322  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  383  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 22, 199100082094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
