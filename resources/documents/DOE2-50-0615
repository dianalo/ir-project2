Proposed mechanisms fell into two categories: directbee perception of enhanced in-hive E fields and perception of shock frominduced currents. The adverse biological effects could be reproducedin simulations where only the worker bees were exposed to shock or toE field in elongated hive entranceways (= tunnels). We now report theresults of full-scale experiments using the tunnel exposure scheme, whichassesses the contribution of shock and intense E field to colony disturbance.Exposure of worker bees (1400 h) to 60-Hz E fields including 100 kV/munder moisture-free conditions within a nonconductive tunnel causes nodeleterious affect on colony behavior. Exposure of bees in conductive(e.g., wet) tunnels produces bee disturbance, increased mortality, abnormalpropolization, and possible impairment of colony growth. We propose thatthis substrate dependence of bee disturbance is the result of perceptionof shock from coupled body currents and enhanced current densities postulatedto exist in the legs and thorax of bees on conductors. Similarly, disturbanceoccurs when bees are exposed to step-potential-induced currents. At 275-350nA single bees are disturbed; at 600 nA bees begin abnormal propolizationbehavior; and stinging occurs at 900 nA. We conclude that biologicaleffects seen in bee colonies under a transmission line are primarilythe result of electric shock from induced hive currents. This evaluationis based on the limited effects of E-field exposure in tunnels, the observeddisturbance thresholds caused by shocks in tunnels, and the ability ofhives exposed under a transmission line to source currents 100-1,000times the shock thresholds.</TEXT></DOC>
