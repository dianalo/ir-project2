Seaga, one of the United States' closest allies in the Caribbean,is rated a 14-point underdog in his bid for an unprecedented thirdconsecutive term in Thursday's election.   A poll published Sunday by The Daily Gleaner, an independentKingston newspaper, said Manley's left-leaning People's NationalParty will win a comfortable 36-seat majority in the 60-seatParliament. The nationwide sampling of 1,024 voters was carried outJan. 27-29 by University of the West Indies political scientist CarlStone. No margin of error was stated.   It is Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980,when an estimated 700 people were killed in a nine-month campaign.Manley boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voterregistration at a time when his popularity was flagging. That gaveSeaga's party all 60 Parliament seats.   Nothing comparable to the 1980 mayhem has occurred, but isolatedshootings, firebombings and stonings have left at least eight deadand 75 injured since the campaign opened Jan. 15.   The Jamaican capital of Kingston, which has 1 millioninhabitants, was calm Sunday with no evidence of extra security.   Last week, Seaga said Manley's party was planning to provokeviolence to intimidate voters in several constituences where supportfor the two parties is evenly split. James Kerr, an ombudsmanappointed to investigate claims of political violence, said policereceived no complaints or information to substantiate the accusation.   At a rally Friday in Crofts Hill, central Jamaica, Manley deniedthe charge. ``We must never allow 1980 to happen again in thiscountry,'' he said. ``Even if you don't believe I have a good heart,at least believe I'm no fool.''   Seaga signed an executive order Saturday calling Jamaica'sNational Reserve into service to help police and the army keep orderThursday. He said 10,000 security force members would be involved inthe operation.   The issue is particularly sensitive with the election coming atthe height of the Caribbean island's winter tourist season. Peoplefear an explosion of violence could set back the industry's recoveryfrom Hurricane Gilbert, which battered Jamaica on Sept. 12, killing45 people and causing $1 billion damage.   ``Jamaica cannot be too proud of its track record in conductingelections and should be keenly aware that this time the world iswatching,'' said a Gleaner editorial.   Heavily armed gangs roaming Kingston's slums traditionally havecontrolled large voting blocs in Jamaica. The main political partiesalways deny any involvement with the gangs, but until this campaignthey did little to restrain them.   In August, Seaga and Manley signed a peace accord pledging torefrain from inflammatory statements and banning ``the procurementor distribution of weapons for use in political activity.''   Seaga has consistently trailed Manley in opinion polls in recentyears, although he closed to within two percentage points shortlyafter Hurricane Gilbert as he rallied the nation in regulartelevision and radio broadcasts.   The charismatic Manley has moderated his image since he was primeminister for eight years during the 1970s and embraced Cuba,alarming the United States and foreign investors.   Now he says he would reopen the Cuban Embassy, closed by Seaga in1980, but would pursue good relations with President Bush'sadministration and Western lending agencies.   ``We will in due course restore formal diplomatic relations (withCuba), but we will do so in a context that ensures that they do notagain become any source of internal tension and do not cause anydifficulties in the United States,'' Manley said Sunday.   Seaga, 58, who was born in Boston and educated at Harvard, hasforged extremely close ties with the United States. He was the firstofficial foreign visitor to Ronald Reagan's White House in 1981 andwas an outspoken supporter of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.   Since taking office in 1980, Seaga has restructured the Jamaicaneconomy, raising taxes and laying off thousands of governmentworkers. The economy has shown steady growth but has never fullyrecovered from the near-collapse of the vital bauxite industry in1983. The standard of living of Jamaica's 2.4 million people hascontinued to fall.   Manley, 64, who was educated at the London School of Economics,accuses Seaga of neglecting basic social services such as health andeducation while more than doubling Jamaica's foreign debt to $3.8billion.   No party has won more than two consecutive five-year terms inJamaica since universal suffrage was introduced in 1944.</TEXT></DOC>
