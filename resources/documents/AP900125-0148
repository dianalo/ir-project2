Although no formal decision has been reached, it is virtuallycertain the assailant, Noel Pagan, will not be tried formanslaughter in the May 1985 stabbing, Assistant Attorney GeneralThomas Goodwin said late Wednesday.   Pagan fought unsuccessfully last year to keep Mark Weaver, theperson he stabbed, alive on a feeding tube so he would not faceadditional charges in the case.   A judge gave permission for Weaver's feeding tube to be removedlast March, and the brain-damaged patient died eight days later atthe age of 26.   Goodwin said the possibility that the state could obtain aconviction against Pagan on manslaughter would not justify the useof resources needed for another trial.   ``At the time Pagan pled and was sentenced on the aggravatedassault charge, everyone understood that Mr. Weaver was not goingto make it,'' and the judge probably took the inevitable death intoconsideration in sentencing Pagan, Goodwin said.   Pagan pleaded guilty to stabbing Mark Weaver in the neck and wassentenced to 10 years in prison with five suspended. With accruedgood-behavior time, he served a little more than three years and isnow on probation and living either in Massachusetts or Connecticut,Goodwin said.   Sylvia Lane, Weaver's mother, said she had hoped the state woulddecide not to prosecute Pagan again. She said she bore him no illwill.</TEXT></DOC>
