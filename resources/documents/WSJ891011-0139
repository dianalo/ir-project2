Expected@  To Post Drop in Profit@  For Its Fiscal Year </HL><DD> 10/11/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> NWS </CO><DATELINE> ADELAIDE, Australia  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rupert Murdoch said News Corp., his Australia-based international media company, may post a decline in profit for the fiscal year ending June 30.    Richard Searby, News Corp.'s chairman, told stockholders at the company's annual meeting that earnings for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 were &quot;adversely affected&quot; by three factors: high interest rates in Australia and Britain, a strike by Australian airline pilots, and &quot;very large costs&quot; of establishing the Sky Television operation, a satellite television service, in Britain.    In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, News Corp.'s American depository shares fell $2 to $23.875.    In August, News Corp. reported that operating profit rose 6.9% to 496.5 million Australian dollars (US$389 million) in the current fiscal year.    &quot;It may be that this year will be the first year in some years when our earnings won't have their customary increase,&quot; Mr. Murdoch said. &quot;So far this financial year, our revenues are ahead of last year's and are still healthy, but they aren't as healthy as we had expected and I feel there is some deterioration setting in.&quot;    Mr. Murdoch said he hopes the &quot;quite possible&quot; drop in profit will be a one-time problem. Mr. Searby said that the company's established businesses are &quot;competitively strong.&quot; Referring to Sky TV, Mr. Searby said, &quot;We did expect a struggle, we allowed for it financially and we are encouraged by our progress to date.&quot;    In New York, John S. Reidy, analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, said the high costs of creating the Sky TV service were anticipated, and were having about the same effect on earnings as the launching of the Fox Broadcasting Co. network several years ago. Mr. Reidy noted that Fox network, once unprofitable, is expected to bring a profit of close to $50 million this fiscal year, its third year of operation. </TEXT></DOC>
