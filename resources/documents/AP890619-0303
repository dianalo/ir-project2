ISBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former top officials of defunct FirstSouthSavings and Loan of Pine Bluff were indicted Monday on federalcharges of fraudulent management and conspiracy.   Howard J. Wiechern Jr., former chairman of the board and chiefexecutive officer, and Roderick D. Reed III, former president andchief operating officer, are accused of concealing information fromthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board, falsifying entries in FirstSouthrecords, and misapplying funds.   U.S. Attorney Chuck Banks said the investigation was continuingand that additional indictments were possible.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board took control of FirstSouth onDec. 5, 1986, in what at the time was the largest Sandamp;L failure inU.S. history.   A 1985 proxy statement listed the thrift's three largeststockholders as George S. Watson of Dallas, A. Starke Taylor III ofDallas and Jerry L. Grigsby of Malvern.   Two of the indictment's five counts charge that Wiechern and Reedconspired to conceal from federal regulators and FirstSouthshareholders and directors a secret agreement not to pursue theguarantees securing loans made to Watson and Taylor for the Watsonand Taylor Realty Co. in Dallas.   The indictment alleges the loans were then listed as income onFirstSouth records to avoid showing a major decline in earnings forthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1985.   The third count alleges Reed made three loans in excess of $20million to Grigsby in violation of federal regulatory requirements,without board approval and for purposes other than what was statedin FirstSouth records.   Reed also is charged in the fourth count with making loanstotaling nearing $33 million to Watson and Taylor Realty Co., alsoin violation of federal regulatory policies.   The fifth count names Wiechern and Reed, alleging they granted a$5.2 million loan to Watson and Taylor Realty Co. in defiance ofinstructions by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and afterpermission for the loan was denied by FirstSouth's directors.   Neither Wiechern nor Reed could be reached for comment. Thehousekeeper who answered the phone at Wiechern's Pine Bluff homesaid he was out of town. Reed's home telephone was answered by awoman who identified herself as his babysitter and said he was nothome.   A man who answered the phone at the Watson and Taylor Realty Co.said everyone had left for the day. A woman who answered the phoneat Grigsby's house said he was not home.   Banks said Wiechern and Reed would be arraigned next week.   Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison andfines ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.</TEXT></DOC>
