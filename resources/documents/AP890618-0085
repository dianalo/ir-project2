The study by the International Energy Agency underscores the factthat the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries nolonger has the strong grip on the world oil market it once did.   The organization has been trying to strengthen its hold on themarket by instilling more production discipline among its members.Sharp, planned cuts in its supply to consuming nations earlier inthe year helped drive up oil prices, leading to higher gasolineprices for consumers.   The report, which takes a look at energy trends over a 17-yearperiod, said OPEC produced 25.4 million barrels of crude a day in1971 to account for about half the world's total output.   In 1980, after two shocks that drove oil prices sharply higher,the cartel's share of the market slipped to 44 percent of totaloutput. OPEC's production was 27.5 million barrels a day.   Its share fell further, to 32 percent in 1987, or about 19.6million barrels a day. Total world production that year was 61million barrels a day.   The cartel recently agreed on a production ceiling of 19.5million barrels a day in the last half of 1989 to try to keep pricesat their strong levels.   OPEC maintains a benchmark price of $18 a barrel. The averageprice for a basket of seven crudes monitored by the organization wasrecently pegged at $17.68 a barrel. It was $12.34 a barrel at theend of November.   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the Americanbenchmark crude, have soared to more than $20 a barrel in trading onthe New York Mercantile Exchange.   The energy agency said world oil production hit a peak of 66million barrels a day in 1979.   The share of output held by developing nations in 1971 was 73percent, or 37.1 million barrels a day. It rose to 77 percent in1979 and then fell to 72 percent in 1987.   World demand for oil grew from 49.6 million barrels a day in 1971to 65.4 million barrels in 1979 and 63 million barrels in 1987, thereport said.   Industrialized nations accounted for most of the demand, takingup 35.2 million barrels a day in 1971 and 36 million barrels in 1987.   Developing nations, including those with centrally plannedeconomies like the Soviet Union, posted demand of 14.4 millionbarrels a day in 1971, rising to 27 million barrels in 1987.   ``Although oil consumption in developing countries has increasedevery year since 1971, the rate of increase has been uneven,'' theenergy agency said in a statement accompanying the report, a heftycompilation of statistical tables.   Growth in consumption eased, it said, after oil prices soared inthe mid- and late 1970s.   Demand for oil among developing nations ``is dominated byrelatively few countries,'' it said.   In 1987, the Soviet Union registered demand of 9.1 millionbarrels a day or 33.8 percent of the total for developing nations.China ranked second with demand of 2.1 million barrels a day,followed by Mexico, 1.5 million barrels; Brazil, 1.3 millionbarrels, and India, 968,000 barrels.   Saudi Arabia posted demand of 937,000 barrels; Iran, 771,000barrels; South Korea, 638,000 barrels; Indonesia, 493,000 barrels,and Argentina, 488,000 barrels, the report said.   With the surge in oil prices in 1979, production in coal soared23 percent to 4.5 billion metric tons in 1987.   In 1983, China passed the Soviet Union to become the world'slargest coal producer, the report said. China turned out 879 millionmetric tons of coal that year and the Soviet Union, 677 millionmetric tons.   Colombia recently boosted its coal exports to 10.2 million metrictons in 1987, becoming the No. 2 exporter after South Africa amongdeveloping countries.   The agency also reported the developing world increased its salesof natural gas.   Developing countries, excluding those with centrally plannedeconomies, exported 71 million oil-equivalent tons of gas in 1987.The Soviet Union exported 70 million tons in the same year. The unitof reference, a million tons of oil equivalent, is equal to 42.3billion cubic feet of natural gas.   Iran was the largest exporter of natural gas in the developingworld in 1971.   But, it said, by 1980 the nation's ``exports were negligiblewhile the number of gas exporters in the developing world haddoubled from five to 10.''   In 1987, Algeria was the No. 1 natural gas exporter in thedeveloping world. Other major exporters were: Indonesia, Brunei,Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates.   The energy agency is made up of 21 industrialized nations,including Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
