This document acknowledgesthose comments. Because these comments are consistent with the initialintent of this rule, the FAA has determined that there is no need for furtheraction other than making this response.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> <T3>Effective date:</T3> October 11, 1988. <T3>Compliance date:</T3> October 11, 1991.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight RecorderFinal Rule docket may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration,Office of the Chief Counsel, Rules Docket, Room 915-G, 800 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20591.

Twentycomments were received, half of which are photocopies of the same letter,although the signatures differ. Moreover, these ten comments lay beyondthe scope of the request set forth in the final rule, and neither opposednor supported the rule or the Part 91 requirements. Of the remaining tencomments, two were in support; four were in opposition; and three wantedfurther clarification or suggested corrections. One remaining comment expandedupon the commenter's earlier submission. Those comments which pointed outcorrections to be made will be addressed in a separate corrective document,which is being developed. Specifically, one commenter based his opposition on the belief that thePart 91 requirement would not contribute to the safety of flight and wouldsimply burden operators/owners with increased costs. Additionally, thecommenter felt that his and others' Fifth Amendment rights would be violatedby requiring aircraft owners to pay for installation of equipment thatcould give information which might be used against them in any civil orcriminal proceeding. Recent reports, especially those from the NationalTransportation Safety Board (NTSB), continue to support the use of CVRsand flight recorders as a means for learning as much as possible aboutaccident circumstances. Obviously, although the presence of the devicewill not prevent accidents, such devices might reveal information thatcould prevent accidents in the future. Fears of intrusion into the FifthAmendment rights of aircraft owners are unfounded; FAR andSection; 121.359(e)states that information obtained from CVRs is used to assist in determiningthe cause of an accident or occurrence, and that such record is not usedin any civil penalty or certificate action by the Administrator. With regardto any criminal action, the rule does not compel testimony, the right protectedby the Fifth Amendment; the rule requires only that CVRs be installed.In addition, where a pilot is not the owner/operator of an aircraft, anyevidence would be provided by a third party, a situation not covered bythe Fifth Amendment. Several commenters, in opposing the rule, cite high costs which, in theirview, will outweight any probable benefits. For example, the Airline Ownersand Pilots Association (AOPA) asserts that the FAA used a complicated formulato obfuscate the fact that the rule is significant and, therefore, minimizedor dismissed the economic impact of the rule on Part 91 operators. TheAOPA also maintains that the costs resulting from this rule are significant.It reasons that, while the FAA estimates the cost of adding a CVR to anaffected aircraft at $25,000, on average, AOPA's sources indicate the realcost will range from $18,500 to $30,000. The AOPA also asserts that installationof a flight recorder would require an additional $40,000 to $45,000. Thus,the total would range from $60,000 to $75,000 and, therefore, unduly burdenmany Part 91 operators. In another argument, GTE asserts that it has little faith in forecastsfor light-weight, low-cost recorders and believes that in reality theyare expensive and heavy. GTE indicates that the Cessna Citation optionslist contain CVRs priced at $35,750 with a weight of 42 pounds. This listalso contains flight recorders priced at $60,775 with a weight yet to bedetermined. Premark International (Premark) expresses a different concern. Premarkstates that the FAA did not follow its usual pattern of ``grandfathering''older aircraft in order to avoid expensive retrofit costs to the Part 91community. Premark also maintains that the cost of CVR modifications foreach of its aircraft is estimated to range from $18,000 to $30,000. Theseestimated costs are for installation only and do not include associatedcosts such as downtime and ferrying. In support of the rule, DOW Chemical U.S.A. (DOW) estimates the actualcosts of equipping King Airs with CVRs to be about $13,000 per aircraft,including down time. DOW points out that these aircraft are already wiredfor this equipment. In order to estimate the cost of the CVR/flight recorder final rule, theFAA averaged many of the possible costs of adding CVR and flight recorderequipment to Part 91 aircraft. Thus, the FAA is not surprised, and neithershould the commenters be surprised, the costs for adding such equipmentto individual aircraft should vary, in some instances by a considerableamount, from this average. The FAA's estimated $25,000 cost falls easilywithin the range of costs_$13,000 to $30,000_presented by commenters. Inaddition, the FAA has provided additional relief from the burdens of thisrule by extending the compliance date by 1 year to October 11, 1991. Regarding flight recorders only, it appears that certain commenters stilldo not understand that the rule does not require aircraft currently inuse to be retrofitted with flight recorder equipment. The rule does requiresuch equipment for aircraft manufactured after October 11, 1991, whichhave a passenger seating capacity of 10 or more. Hence, no costs relatedto flight recorder equipment retrofitting may be attributed to this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The FAA has determined, based on the above discussion, that no furtherrulemaking action is necessary at this time. Amendment No. 91-204 remainsin effect as prescribed by the July 11, 1988, final rule.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on June 29, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
