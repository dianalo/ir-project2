Benigno Zaccagnini, who headedItaly's dominant Christian Democratic Party during its brief``historic compromise'' with the Communists in the 1970s, diedSunday. He was 77.   Zaccagnini, whose political career spanned five decades andpeaked during one of the country's most volatile post-World War IIperiods, died in a Ravenna hospital after suffering a heart attack.   Born in Ravenna on April 7, 1912, Zaccagnini was elected toParliament for the first time in 1948. He was re-elected to theChamber of Deputies nine consecutive times and elected to theSenate in 1983.   He served as secretary of the Christian Democrats from 1975 to1980, replacing Amintore Fanfani as party chief after theCommunists made strong gains in regional and municipal elections.   In 1976, the Communists drew almost even with the ChristianDemocrats in national elections, opening the way for the compromisefor power sharing by the two parties.   Zaccagnini rejected a formal governing alliance with theCommunists but said they could play a constructive opposition roleto help Italy through its economic and monetary crisis.   The compromise was partially realized in 1978 when ChristianDemocrat Premier Aldo Moro worked out an arrangement giving theCommunists a voice in government policies but no Cabinet seats.   Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped Moro the day the pact wasgoing into force in Parliament on March 6, 1978. Moro was killedafter 55 days in captivity and the pact collapsed after 10 months.   Zaccagnini, known by many Italians as ``Zac,'' continued to bean influential member of the Christian Democrats until his death,leading a leftist faction of the party.   Zaccagnini was a doctor, specializing in pediatrics. He servedas a medical officer on the Balkan front from 1941 to 1943 in WorldWar II.   Christian Democrat Premier Giulio Andreotti sent a mesagge toZaccagnini's widow Anna, recalling ``so many moments of work withyour husband in circumstances that were among the most tragic ofour nation.''   The current Christian Democrat secretary, Arnaldo Forlani,described Zaccagnini as ``one of the most exemplary figures of theChristian Democrats and a clear reference point of our politicallife.''   Communist Party leader Achille Occhetto said, ``His contributionto our democracy was great.''</TEXT></DOC>
