The accord would facilitate settlement of the nation'ssecond-largest insurance failure and signals a decision byindustry leaders to resolve the Executive Life case asswiftly as possible. The accord also appears to spell the endof a once-prominent plan for the industry-backed guarantyfunds to themselves acquire the failed insurer, a unit ofFirst Executive Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The pact was approved in principle earlier this week by acommittee of life insurance guaranty associations. It isbeing privately reviewed by 47 individual state funds, whichtogether may have to bear as much as $1.9 billion inpolicyholder and annuity claims related to Executive Life.Most, if not all, of those state organizations must agree tothe proposal for it to work.   There were indications that some states may have at leastinitial objections. However, a spokeswoman for the NationalOrganization of Life and Health Guaranty Associations, acoordinating body representing the state funds, said theorganization &quot;is optimistic that an agreement can bereached.&quot;   The accord, significantly, calls for the nationalorganization and its member funds to drop their opposition incourt to a French investor group's $3.55 billion plan to buyExecutive Life and most of its vast junk bond portfolio.   That step could band regulators, the industry and theguaranty funds behind the bid in which, as reported, AltusFinance, a subsidiary of the French bank Credit LyonnaisS.A., would buy most of Executive Life's junk bonds for $3.25billion in cash. In a related transaction, a French investorgroup headed by the insurer Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale deFrance would inject a further $300 million into ExecutiveLife and continue the company under a new name.   If achieved, the decision not to oppose the Altus bidwould be a major change in tactics for the life insuranceindustry, which has to date opposed the Altus bid asinadequate.   A spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers, apowerful group that has been coordinating much of theindustry's reaction to the Executive Life failure, saidWednesday that &quot;at this point, we are anxious to have thematter resolved as swiftly as possible.&quot; The spokesman addedthat earlier objections to the French group's bid have beenset aside as substantial improvements have been made to thebid. The Altus offer, at this point, &quot;is bearable,&quot; said thespokesman.   The French group was selected on Nov. 14 after a prolongedauction that began with eight formal bidders. CaliforniaInsurance Commissioner John Garamendi initially picked aproposal by the National Organization of Life and HealthGuaranty Associations and its member funds, which was backedby the industry. That bid, known as the Nolhga bid, was laterrejected by Mr. Garamendi when it failed to meet certainconditions he had set when approving it.   Nolhga and the state guaranty funds have opposed theFrench bid in the state court in Los Angeles that isoverseeing Executive Life's conservatorship and that mustapprove the final disposition of the failed insurer. Thatrear-guard action now would be set aside if the new plan goesthrough.   In addition to dropping opposition to the French bid, theproposed pact would revise and renew a so-called &quot;enhancementagreement&quot; between the guaranty funds, the Altus group, andMr. Garamendi, allowing the enhancement agreement toaccomodate an important recent court decision. The earlieragreement fell apart two weeks ago when a California statecourt held that the claims of $1.85 billion of municipalbonds backed by Executive Life ranked equally with those ofconventional policyholders and annuitants.   Immediately after the court ruling, state guaranty fundsbacked away from the earlier accord, which sharply increasedthe prospective guaranty costs. Mr. Garamendi is appealingthe decision.   Restructuring plans have assumed that the municipal bondclaims were subordinate to Executive Life's about $8 billionof other liabilities, essentially eliminating the municipalbond claims.   But, if upheld, the ruling would require limited assets tobe stretched further to meet the wider claims. Initial valuesof about 90 cents on the dollar for policyholders andannuitants under the Altus plan would be revised to about 72cents if the so-called muni-GIC claims are included. And thestate guaranty funds would have to pay about $1.9 billion orso over time, more than doubling the $900 million in claimsinitially estimated.   The proposed guaranty fund pact would accept either case,depending on whether the California Court of Appeals includesor excludes the muni-GIC claims. Regulators and the Frenchinvestment group have said they hope to close the saletransaction by the end of the year in a way that also wouldadjust for any appeals outcome.   Approval of the proposed guaranty fund pact would likelyaccelerate court consideration of the French bid. Among otherthings, the court might be asked to approve the liquidationof Executive Life, a formal step that has been anticipated. Aliquidation order would lock in the guaranty fund obligationsand trigger initial industry assessments to cover theguarantees.</TEXT></DOC>
