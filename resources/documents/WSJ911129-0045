Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary of CommerceRobert Mosbacher urged the Federal Communications Commissionto let satellite companies that aren't members of aninternational telecommunications consortium connect theirsatellite service to the U.S. phone network. But under theplan, they couldn't do so until January 1997. The FCC isexpected to ratify the request.</LP><TEXT>   The proposal effectively would let such satellitecompanies as privately held Alpha Lyracom SpaceCommunications Inc., Greenwich, Conn., offer internationalphone service in competition with Comsat. Currently, AlphaLyracom, which owns one satellite, is restricted to carryingTV broadcasts and international links for corporatetelecommunications systems. The company plans to launch threemore satellites by 1997.   Another privately held concern, Orion Network SystemsInc., Rockville, Md., plans to launch its firstcommunications satellite in 1994. Competition among the firmsand Comsat is expected to drive down international phonecharges for big companies that own their own privatenetworks.   A spokesman for Comsat, which had opposed the grant ofadditional authority to its competitors, said the company waspleased by the administration plan -- apparently because itwould hold off competition for five more years. &quot;We're readyfor any and all competition,&quot; he said.   International satellite service is tightly controlled bythe 120-member cartel called the InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organization, or Intelsat. ButIntelsat's revenue plunged 19% in 1990 to $498.6 millionbecause of competition from fiberoptic cables and because ofimprovements in satellite technology that let phone companieschannel a number of calls into a single satellite circuit.Comsat is the U.S. representative to Intelsat and owns a22.9% stake in the organization.   Janice Obuchowski, head of a Commerce Departmenttelecommunications agency, said the administration proposedwaiting five years before allowing non-Intelsat companies toconnect to the phone network out of fear of harming Intelsat.&quot;It will give them time to work through the issues andreprice their services fairly,&quot; she said.   But Rene Anselmo, chairman of Alpha Lyracom, said he wouldappeal the five-year wait. The company petitioned the FCCmore than a year ago to let it offer regular phone service inhope of supplying long-distance companies with satelliteservice. But the proposal was held up as the NationalSecurity Council debated whether opening the internationalphone system affect the Pentagon or intelligence agenciesthat intercept calls.   The administration plan would give Intelsat's competitorsone immediate boost. The plan said the companies should beable immediately to offer satellite service to privatecommunications networks, even if those networks haveswitchboards that route calls or data into the broad U.S.phone system. Some corporate networks connect suppliers,distributors and dealers in a mini-version of the publicphone network.   Assuming the FCC goes along, as expected, non-Intelsatcompanies will be able to market satellite services moreaggressively to these big private networks. &quot;They've takenaway one of our handicaps,&quot; said Mr. Anselmo.</TEXT></DOC>
