The commission said the Federation of European AerosolManufacturers will voluntarily reduce the use ofchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in aerosol cans by 90 percent by Dec.31, 1990.   ``Since the use of CFCs in aerosols accounts for about 45percent of the total use of CFCs in the Community, we will beachieving with this voluntary agreement ... a higher reduction thanthe 20 percent reduction required'' under the 1987 MontrealProtocol, the commission said in a statement Thursday.   The Montreal treaty, signed by 40 nations, is aimed at loweringthe use of chlorofluorocarbons, which have been blamed for thedeterioration of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from thecancer-causing effects of ultraviolet rays and increases thegreenhouse effect, or heating of the environment.   Exempted from the voluntary accord with the EEC Commission,however, are aerosols used in electronics and pharmaceuticals andsome specialized industrial uses, the EEC Commission said.   It said it will seek similar accords with other trade groupsthat use CFCs in their industries, such as makers of refrigerators,air conditioners, solvents and foam plastics.   When released into the environment, CFCs rise into stratospherewhere ultraviolet rays break them up releasing chlorine and bromineatoms that can keep destroying the ozone layer for years.</TEXT></DOC>
