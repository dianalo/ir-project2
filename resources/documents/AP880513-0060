Khomeini voted in a mobile polling booth outside his heavilyguarded residence in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran an hourafter voting began at 7 a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT Thursday), theofficial Islamic Republic News Agency said.   The report came as rumors swept the Hong Kong stock market thatKhomeini, 87 and reported to have been in poor health for sometime, had died.   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, gave no indication of Khomeini'sphysical appearance when he cast his ballot.   The first round of voting April 8, in which Khomeini alsoparticipated, elected 188 of the 270 deputies in the Majlis, orParliament.   At stake in today's run-off are the other 82 electoraldistricts, including 16 of the 30 in Tehran. Polls close at 5 p.m.(9:30 a.m. EDT).   IRNA gave no indication of how many of Iran's estimated 22million-strong electorate were involved in today's voting and didnot mention turnout.   But it said that Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, whopolled more than 1.3 million votes in the April 8 round,Prosecutor-General Hojatoleslam Mohammad Musavi Khoeiniha andofficials from Khomeini's office cast their votes in Jamaran afterthe aging revolutionary patriarch.   President Ali Khamenei and Prime Minister Hussein Musavi votedin south Tehran mosques, which were being used as polling stations,IRNA said.   They later joined marches in the capital to mark Qods, orJerusalem, Day, held on the last Friday of the holy Moslem fastingmonth of Ramadan.   This was the third parliamentary election since Khomeini'sIslamic revolution toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in1979.   April's balloting was held amid Iraqi missile and air attacks onIranian cities. Both sides in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war haveobserved a truce in the so-called ``war of the cities'' since April21.   Major military setbacks in recent weeks have increased tensionsin Iran.   Among those setbacks were the loss of the Faw peninsula insouthern Iraq, recaptured by the Iraqis April 18 after a 26-monthIranian occupation, and naval clashes in the gulf the same day inwhich the U.S. Navy sank or crippled six Iranian vessels.   In the aftermath of those defeats, radicals and Moslemextremists were expected to widen the seizeable gains they made inthe first round of voting. Several leading conservatives lost theirseats then.   But the main election issues have been economic and socialreform.   The composition of the new Majlis, which will sit for fouryears, will have considerable influence on the direction that theIslamic revolution will take and on who will succeed Khomeini.   The radicals seek centralized state control of the economy andbroadening of reforms.   The conservatives, including fundamentalist clerics, aresupported by the ``Bazaaris,'' the weathy merchant class that hassurvived the revolution and believes in a capitalist system.   ``The conservatives have lost out rather badly,'' noted PhilipRobbins, an Iran specialist with the Royal Institute ofInternational affairs in London.   ``The new Majlis looks like being a far more radical body thanit was before, particularly on the important issue of economicpolicy,'' he said in a telephone interview.   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful figure in Iran afterKhomeini, appears to be one of the bigger winners in the election.   He supports major reforms that have long been blocked by theconservative-dominated Council of Guardians, a watchdog body thathas the power to veto Majlis legislation considered to violateIslamic tenets.   ``The radicals will bolster Rafsanjani's positionconsiderably,'' Robbins noted.   Khomeini, who also favors economic reforms and wants to see therevolution set on a firm course before he dies, gave the radicals abig boost before the April voting.   He delivered a series of edicts widening state powers thatopened the way for reformist legislation vetoed by the 13-memberCouncil of Guardians.   The radicals got another shot in the arms Thursday, when TehranRadio rebroadcast an announcement Khomeini made before the April 8poll.   ``People must vote for the best candidates, those who havetasted the sour taste of poverty and misery; those who are the truerepresentatives of the poor and deprived of the world, not thosewho represent the Islam of the rich, the capitalists, the arrogant,the opportunists. I mean the Islam of the Americans,'' he said.   Although the Majlis does not control Iran's war strategy, whichis determined by the Supreme Defense Council, the radicals' growingpolitical power could have a significant influence in that regard.</TEXT></DOC>
