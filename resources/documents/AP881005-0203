Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, told TheAssociated Press in an interview that he requested an urgentmeeting with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar andHonduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras to discuss theproposal.   Lopez Contreras recommended in a speech to the General AssemblyTuesday night that military forces from Canada, Spain and WestGermany be sent to Honduras to carry out the proposed mission.   Lopez Contreras said the peace force would be asked to evictSalvadoran rebels from Honduras, as well as the U.S.-supportedNicaraguan rebels known as Contras.   ``We would like to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' D'Escotosaid, adding that Honduras has made such proposals before but neverfollowed up on them.   At least 10,000 Nicaraguan insurgents have settled along theHonduran side of the country's border with Nicaragua since the U.S.Congress suspended military aid to the rebels last February. Theydepend on U.S. assistance for their survival.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidthe administration will give the Honduran proposal ``seriousconsideration.''   The Contras' use of Honduran territory as a springboard forattacks inside Nicaragua has produced numerous cross-border clashesbetween the two countries over the years.   D'Escoto said he canceled plans to leave New York Thursdaymorning so he can pursue the Honduran initiative. He said he iswilling to remain until a ``viable and acceptable request'' is madeto the United Nations by the secretary-general.   He said Lopez Conteras made a similar proposal to theOrganization of American States last November but that Honduras didnot press the matter.   The Reagan administration has said for years that militarypressure by the Contras is necessary to ensure democracy inNicaragua. The dismantling of the Contras would almost certainlylead to the consolidation of the leftist Sandinista government andto an escalation of its efforts to undermine its neighbors, theadministration has maintained.   D'Escoto said Nicaragua has long favored establishment of averification commission to ensure that each Central Americancountry does not interfere with its neighbors.   Lopez Contreras said in an interview with the AP earlierWednesday that even if a peace force is agreed to, it wouldrepresent only a partial solution.   He said one main source of Honduran concern is continued Sovietmilitary aid to the Sandinista government, which U.S. officialshave estimated at $400 million for the first eight months of 1988.   ``We cannot stop the Soviets from supplying arms to theSandinistas,'' Lopez Contreras said. ``That is an issue that has tobe addressed by the United States.''   He said that without a minimum of understanding between thesuperpowers, ``It is going to be absolutely impossible to reach anykind of settlement in Central America.''</TEXT></DOC>
