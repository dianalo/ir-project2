I'm going tointensify them now and ... renew an appeal to Syria to help, renewan appeal to Lebanon, renew an appeal to Iran to try to get theAmerican hostages returned,'' Jackson said in an ABC-TV newsinterview from The Omni arena where the Democratic NationalConvention is under way.   ``I've talked, for example, to several Middle Easternambassadors today,'' Jackson said later in a CBS News interview.``I shall reach out to Lebanon and Syria and to other people I knowin the region.   ``Hopefully we can seize this moment to make a breakthrough, tomake a very basic appeal to religious and political leaders to tryto gain the freedom of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon,'' he added.   Jackson did not elaborate further on actions he was taking. Inthe past he has said he was putting the word out through thecontacts he has in the region.   At a news conference earlier in the day, Jackson had mentionedthat Iran announced its acceptance of a truce in te war, and saidhe would hope that would be a positive sign ``to gain theopportunity of freeing the American hostages.''   Jackson has said that while he does not know where the hostagesare, he has contacts in the Middle East who might be able to makesuch an appeal.   The hostages are believed to be held by radical Lebanese groupswho have links to Iran.   Iran's announcement was widely seen as a breakthrough towardending the war, which has claimed an estimated 1 million livessince it began in September 1980. The Tehran government, batteredby a series of recent military defeats, said it will accept withoutcondition the truce resolution developed by the United Nations.</TEXT></DOC>
