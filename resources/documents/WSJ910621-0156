The new policy, spelled out by Transportation SecretarySamuel Skinner in a speech in London, shows the continuedevolution of the administration's views on theforeign-ownership issue. Mr. Skinner said it was important&quot;to create an environment more receptive to foreigninvestment in the U.S. airline industry.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Foreigners currently are permitted to hold up to 25% of anairline's voting stock, and up to 49% of its nonvoting stock.But some airlines and analysts have been pressing for aliberalized rule, arguing that carriers need better access tocapital in order to grow and compete in an increasinglyglobal industry.   Rep. William Clinger Jr. (R., Pa.), who introducedlegislation in February that would allow foreigners to holdup to 49% of the voting shares in U.S. carriers, said he was&quot;delighted&quot; by Mr. Skinner's announcement. &quot;It's importantthat airlines have the option of seeking capital overseas,&quot;he said.   But whether Mr. Skinner's pronouncement will spur Congressto act is unclear. Rather than being considered separately,Rep. Clinger's bill has been subsumed into a comprehensiveaviation bill drafted by Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.),chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee.   That bill, which called for increased regulation of thetransfer of gates, slots and international routes, provokedthe ire of the airline industry. In addition, so manyconditions were placed on the foreign-ownership provisionthat Rep. Clinger doesn't support it. Now, the bill is beingrewritten, and Rep. Clinger believes some of his originallanguage will be restored. Legislation relaxing the ownershiplimit hasn't been introduced in the Senate.   If, nevertheless, a less-restrictive rule were to clearCongress, Hap Pareti, president of Airline Economics Inc.,believes that the stronger carriers would benefit most bygaining greater access to less costly foreign markets tofinance expansion plans. As for the weaker carriers, he said,&quot;I don't see it as a saving grace.&quot;   The administration has been shifting its stance on foreignownership of airlines. In the fall of 1989, Mr. Skinnerdirected KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to sell a big chunk of thestock it held in NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines, even thoughthe voting-stock holdings didn't exceed the legal limits. Hefeared that KLM would nevertheless be able to exert controlover the U.S. carrier.   But this past January, he changed his mind, saying thathenceforth foreign investment of up to 49% would bepermitted, provided the amount of voting stock owned didn'texceed the 25% legal limit. The decision meant that KLMdidn't have to sell the Northwest stock.   Mr. Skinner may have made his announcement in Londonpartly because of rumors that British Airways PLC has aninterest in obtaining a substantial stake in USAir Group Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
