The revised regulation incorporatesrecent amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801 <T3>et seq.</T3>) contained in section 565 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, section 565, 101 Stat. 1815,1945). These statutory amendments permanently extend the act and expandits coverage to mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank and savings and loanholding companies, and also to savings and loan service corporations thatoriginate or purchase mortgage loans. Until now, the act's coverage hasapplied only to depository institutions and their majority-owned subsidiaries.Other proposed changes to the regulation are based on a zero-based reviewundertaken in keeping with the Board's Regulatory Improvement Program (whichcalls for a periodic review of Board regulations). The changes have beenmade in the interest of facilitating compliance for covered institutions.While the Board's proposal totally revises the existing regulation, thereporting requirements remain identical in substance for institutions thatwere covered before the Congress amended the law, with one exception. Theexception relates to mortgage banking subsidiaries of depository institutions.These subsidiaries would be required, under the Board's proposal, to itemizeloan data by census tract (or by county, in some instances) for propertylocated in metropolitan statistical areas where the subsidiary has officesfor taking loan applications from the public. Under current law, the subsidiaryis required to itemize loan data only for an MSA where the parent institutionhas its home or branch offices, and reports data as an aggregate sum forloans on property located in other MSAs.The Board proposes to retain the HMDA-1 form now used by depository institutionsfor reporting loan data. In addition, the Board proposes to issue a separateform, HMDA-2, for the use of the newly covered entities. A separate formis necessary because the statutory amendments require the newly coveredentities to exclude FHA loans from their data compilations, whereas depositoryinstitutions and their majority-owned subsidiaries will continue to reportFHA loan data. Because some of the newly covered entities have expressedinterest in making data about their FHA loan originations and purchasespublicly available in some fashion, the Board is also publishing for commenton optional form, HMDA-2A, that could be used for this purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before June 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be mailed to William W.

It requires depository institutions that have over $10million in assets, and have offices in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)or primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), to disclose annuallytheir originations and purchases of mortgage and home improvement loans.Data must be itemized by census tract (or by county, in some instances)and also by type of loan. A statement covering the data on a calendar yearbasis must be made available to the public and reported to the institution'sFederal supervisory agency by March 31 following the calendar year forwhich the data are compiled.When originally passed in 1975, HMDA contained a ``sunset'' provision underwhich the act was to expire in 1980. A number of temporary extensions wereenacted, and recently, in the Housing and Community Development Act of1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, section 565, 101 Stat. 1815, 1945), Congress permanentlyextended HMDA by striking the sunset provision from the act. The statutoryamendments were signed into law on February 5, 1988.In addition to the permanent extension, the amendments in the Housing Actexpanded the coverage of HMDA to include mortgage banking subsidiariesof bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, as wellas savings and loan service corporations. The Board is now proposing amendmentsto Regulation C to implement these changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Effective Date</ITAG>With regard to the expanded coverage of HMDA, there is some uncertaintyas to the legislative intent concerning the year in which service corporationsand mortgage banking subsidiaries are to begin collecting data and reporting.While it is clear that the amendments brought these institutions withinthe coverage of the act in 1987, it is not evident that Congress intendedthat they should collect and report data for that calendar year.The Board proposes to require that these institutions collect loan databeginning with calendar year 1988; their first report would be due on March31, 1989. This approach is consistent with existing Regulations C, whichrequires institutions that become subject to the regulation within a givencalendar year to compile loan data beginning with the following calendaryear.<ITAG tagnum="84">(3) Regulatory Review</ITAG>The Board's Regulatory Improvement Program calls for periodic review ofeach of the Board's regulations to determine whether the regulation canbe simplified. The Board has conducted such a review of Regulation C andhas made a number of changes. The text of the regulation has been revisedto improve clarity and readability. Obsolete provisions have been deleted,footnotes have been eliminated, and a detailed appendix regarding stateexemptions has been replaced by a brief reference in the regulation. Inaddition, the instructions to the reporting forms have been significantlyreworked and should be easier to follow.<ITAG tagnum="84">(4) Availability of Aggregated Data</ITAG>As required by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Federal FinancialInstitutions Examination Council (with support from the Federal ReserveBoard and the other financial regulators) produces aggregated tables ofthe loan data received from all reporting institutions in each MSA. Inaddition, the Examination Council produces tables for each MSA showinglending patterns according to demographic characteristics (such as incomelevel and age of housing stock). These tables, together with data on theindividual institutions, are sent to central data depositories in eachMSA. The act specifies that the aggregated data and related tables shallbe available no later than December 31 following the calendar year to whichthey relate. Typically, the Examination Council has released these reportsby late November or early December.The conference report accompanying the HMDA amendments indicates Congressionalinterest in having the HMDA data available at the central data depositoriesearlier than is now the case. Member agencies of the Examination Councilhave identified and will implement changes to data processing proceduresin order to facilitate the earlier availability of the data.The Board believes the proposed revision of Regulation C (together withthe expanded instructions for the reporting forms) will enhance complianceon the part of financial institutions. By reducing errors that requireediting following the submission of reports on March 31, these changesshould help ensure that the aggregated data is available earlier.<ITAG tagnum="84">(5) Proposed Amendments to     Regulation C</ITAG>The comment period on the revised regulation ends on June 20, 1988. Becauseprompt implementation of the statutory amendments is in the public interest,the Board has set this comment period in place of the 60 days called forin the Board's policy statement on rulemaking (44 FR 3957). The Board believesan abbreviated comment period is necessary to ensure that a final ruleis in place as quickly as possible to provide guidance to newly coveredentities.A discussion follows of the changes made to each section of the revisedregulation.Section 203.1 Authority, purpose, and scope.Several changes would be made. Section 203.1(a) would be revised to reflectthe deletion of section 2811 of the statute, the sunset date provision.A reference would be added to reflect the approval of information collectionrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the U.S. Office of Managementand Budget. A reference to the act has been added to the purpose statementin andSection; 203.1(b). Editorial changes have been made to andSection; 203.1(c)on scope and andSection; 203.1(d) on central data depositories (includingthe substitution of ``depositories'' for ``repositories,'' now that theterm ``depository institution'' is no longer used in the regulation).Section 203.2 Definitions.Section 203.2 contains definitions of terms used in the regulation. Thedefinitions of ``FHA, FmHA, and VA loans'' and ``state'' contained in currentandSection; 203.2 (d) and (g) have not been revised, but are renumbered asandSection; 203.2 (c) and (i) because of other changes to the section. Therevisions to other definitions are as follows.<T3>Act. </T3>The definition of ``act'' in andSection; 203.2(a) has beenupdated.<T3>Branch office. </T3>The definition of ``branch office'' in andSection;203.2(b) would be revised. What qualifies as a branch office has severalconsequences for an institution. First, institutions that do not have ahome or branch office in an MSA or PMSA are exempt from HMDA. Second, HMDAdata must be itemized by census tract for loans on property located inany MSA or PMSA in which the institution has a home or branch office. Forloans on property located in other MSAs or PMSAs (or not located in anMSA or PMSA at all), the data may be reported as an aggregate sum, withno geographic itemization. Third, the data must be made available to thepublic at one branch office (or home office) in each MSA or PMSA wherethe institution has home or branch offices. Finally, the institution mustpost notices, such as those made available by the Board, in all branchoffices located in MSAs or PMSAs to inform the public of the availabilityof the HMDA data.The revised definition takes account of the difference between the branchoffice structure of the newly covered mortgage banking firms and that ofdepository institutions such as banks and thrift institutions. While depositoryinstitutions must obtain approval from Federal or state regulatory agenciesto establish branch offices, mortgage banking firms generally are not requiredto obtain such approval.Accordingly, the definition of branch office would differ for the two classesof institutions. The definition in revised andSection; 203.2(b)(1)(i) appliesto depository institutions; it remains the same as in the current provisionand is based on the approval process. For other covered institutions, theBoard proposes to define ``branch office'' in andSection; 203.2(b)(1)(ii)as an office that receives applications from the public for home purchaseor home improvement loans. This latter definition could also apply to mortgagebanking subsidiaries of depository institutions, which are independentlydefined as financial institutions under andSection; 203.2(e)(2).<T3>Federally related mortgage loan. </T3>Banks and other depository institutionsare subject to HMDA only if they make ``federally related mortgage loans.''The definition of that term, currently in footnote 1, has been simplifiedand incorporated in the text of the regulation as andSection; 203.2(d).<T3>Financial institution. </T3>The new definition of institutions coveredby Regulation C is set forth in andSection; 203.2(e), and replaces the definitionof ``depository institution'' currently contained in andSection; 203.2(c).The existing term ``depository institution'' would be changed to ``financialinstitution.'' This change is designed to avoid the confusion that mightarise from the fact that, in ordinary usage, the term depository institutionsignifies entities such as banks and thrift institutions, not mortgagebanking firms and other entities that do not take deposits. The definitionwould be revised to include both depository institutions and the new classof covered entities: Savings and loan service corporations and mortgagebanking subsidiaries of bank holding companies and savings and loan holdingcompanies.As noted above, depository institutions are subject to HMDA only if theymake federally related mortgage loans. The statutory amendment does notrequire, as a condition of coverage, that the newly covered entities makefederally related mortgage loans. The regulatory definition of ``financialinstitution'' would parallel the statute, with the ``federally relatedloan'' limitation applying only to depository institutions.The new definition also addresses the coverage of industrial banks. Industrialbanks, which are also known by other terms such as industrial loan companiesor industrial loan and thrift companies, are not among the types of institutionscurrently referred to in the definition of ``depository institution.''In recent years, however, industrial banks have taken on many of the characteristicsof commercial and savings banks. Some industrial banks accept time andsavings deposits and offer NOW accounts; and they often use other typesof savings instruments (such as thrift certificates and investment certificates)that are defined as deposits by the Depository Institutions Act of 1982and that are eligible for FDIC insurance. Industrial banks may also becomemembers of the Federal Reserve System. Because of these similarities, theBoard proposes to revise the definition of ``financial institution'' toinclude industrial banks.The Board also proposes to treat majority-owned subsidiaries of depositoryinstitutions as independent financial institutions for purposes of theregulation. Doing so would increase their reporting burden somewhat. Giventhe revised branch office definition, these subsidiaries would be requiredto itemize loan data for every MSA in which they have an office for takingloan applications. Treating them as independent entities, however, wouldproduce a consistent rule for all mortgage banking subsidiaries, whetherthe parent is a holding company or a depository institution. Consequently,the Board proposes to define any subsidiary of a financial institutionas a financial institution in its own right, in andSection; 203.2(e)(2).(Under andSection; 203.4(a), a subsidiary could report on a consolidatedbasis with the parent institution or separately.) The Board requests commentregarding the impact of the increased itemization, including any additionalcosts.<T3>Home improvement and home purchase loans. </T3>The definitions of ``homeimprovement loan'' and ''home purchase loan,'' currently in andSection; 203.2(e) and (f), have been clarified and now appear as andSection; 203.2 (f)and (g). Old footnotes 2 and 3 have been incorporated into the definitionof ``home improvement loan.''The parenthetical in the first sentence of existing andSection; 203.2(f),regarding the types of dwellings to which the definition applies, has beenrevised to refer only to those types about which a question might arise.The second sentence, which expressly excludes from the definition temporaryfinancing and the purchase of an interest in a pool of mortgage loans (suchas mortgage participation certificates issued by the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation, the Government National Mortgage Association, orthe Farmers Home Administration) has been deleted. The exclusion of theseparticular arrangements now appears in andSection; 203.4(c), with other excludedcategories.The current and the revised definitions of home purchase loan are limitedto loans for the purchase of ``residential real property.'' A home improvementloan, in contrast, is defined in terms of ``residential dwelling,'' raisingquestions about differences in coverage since ``dwelling'' may includeresidential structures such as mobile homes that are not classified asreal property in some states. The Board requests comment on whether, inthe final version of the regulation, dwelling units such as mobile or manufacturedhomes should be covered under either the home improvement or the home purchaseloan definition, or both.<T3>Metropolitan statistical area.</T3> The term ``standard metropolitanstatistical area,'' which is obsolete, has been replaced with the term``metropolitan statistical area'' (MSA), defined in andSection; 203.2(h).The meaning is unchanged, and includes primary metropolitan statisticalareas (PMSAs).Section 203.3 Exempt institutions.Section 203.3 excludes from the coverage of the regulation small institutions,institutions without offices in MSAs, and those that are subject to a similarstate law and have been granted an exemption from the Federal law.The provisions of this section have been reorganized and the language clarified;the substantive rules remain unchanged. Material relating to state lawexemptions has been grouped together in andSection; 203.3(b). A new andSection;203.3(b)(2) has been added to indicate that a state or a financial institutionmay apply to the Board for an exemption from the regulation based on theexistence of a similar state disclosure law. This reference replaces thedetailed discussion in current Appendix B (which the Board proposes todelete) about the filing of applications for state exemptions.Section 203.4 Compilation of loan data.Section 203.4 specifies loan data that is to be included in or excludedfrom disclosure statements. It sets forth the requirements for itemizationof loan data by census tract or county and by type of loan, and is thebasis for the detailed instructions that accompany the reporting formscontained in the revised Appendix A.The provisions of this section have been revised for clarification. Obsoletematerial in footnotes 4, 5, 6, and 7 has been deleted, and informationthat is still relevant has been moved to the instructions for the reportingforms.A provision has been added in andSection; 203.4(a)(2) to permit mortgagebanking subsidiaries of depository institutions to report either separatelyor on a consolidated basis with their parent institution. Currently, theyare required to file a consolidated report under existing andSection; 203.2(c),which defines ``depository institution.''Section 203.4(c) lists types of loan to be excluded from the disclosures.The first six, listed in paragraph (c)(1), apply both to depository institutionsand to the newly covered entities. Three of them are the exclusions listedin existing andSection; 203.4(c). Two of the three others (temporary financingand the purchase of an interest in a pool of loans) have been moved intorevised andSection; 203.4 from the definition of ``home purchase loan'' inexisting andSection; 203.2(f).The sixth exclusion applicable to all institutions is set forth in andSection;203.4(c)(1)(vi) and relates to the purchase of loan servicing rights. Thepurchase of servicing rights in secondary market transactions is a practicecommon among mortgage bankers. When loans are sold, for example, the buyermay issue securities backed by a pool of loans that it has acquired. Theright to service the loans, however, may be retained by the seller/originatorof the mortgages. These servicing rights may later be transferred fromone institution to another for a purchase price that is usually a smallpercentage (such as 1 or 2 percent) of the value of the underlying loans.The act and regulation require institutions to report data on mortgageloans that they purchase. The Board believes that a covered institution'spurchase of these servicing rights does not accurately reflect the extentto which an institution has made mortgage credit available in a community.Accordingly, the revised regulation would exclude from the reporting requirementthe purchase of servicing rights to mortgage loans.The final exclusion, contained in andSection; 203.4(c)(2), applies only inthe case of mortgage banking subsidiaries and savings and loan servicecorporations. That section excludes from the reporting requirement loansthat are insured under Title I or II of the National Housing Act (thatis, FHA-insured home improvement and home purchase loans); it implementsnew section 304(g) of HMDA, which expressly provides for their exclusion.(Under section 311 of HMDA, data on FHA-insured loans made by these typesof lenders is to be collected by the U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment.) As discussed under Appendix A, the Board proposes to providean optional form that could be used by these institutions to disclose theirFHA lending activity.Section 203.5 Disclosure and reporting requirements.Section 203.5 relates to making loan data available at offices of an institutionand reporting the data to supervisory agencies. Changes, none of them substantive,have been made to the language and structure of this section to clarifyits requirements. As under the existing provisions, disclosure statementsfor a given calendar year are due by the following March 31.Section 203.6 Administrative enforcement; sanctions for violations.Section 203.6 sets forth rules relating to administrative enforcement.Minor changes to the language and structure of this section have been madeto clarify its provisions.Appendix A_Forms and InstructionsAppendix A of the current regulation, which lists supervisory agencies,has been designated as Appendix B in the revised regulation; and the currentAppendix C, containing the mortgage disclosure forms, is now Appendix A.The revised Appendix A contains two reporting forms and accompanying instructions,plus an optional form. Institutions must use the prescribed format of theappropriate form, either HMDA-1 or new HMDA-2, but they are not requiredto use the form itself. An institution may, for example, choose to producea computer printout of its disclosure statement instead.The HMDA-1 reporting form continues to be the prescribed form for use bydepository institutions and their majority-owned subsidiaries. The instructionsfor completing the form have been expanded significantly to facilitatecompliance, but the form itself remains basically unchanged except forminor revisions that do not affect the data compilation. Column headingshave been changed to read ``total dollar amount'' instead of ``principalamount,'' but the data to be reported in these columns remains the same.Accordingly, institutions will not have to make changes in their data processingprocedures. A signature line has been added, calling for an officer ofthe reporting institution to certify the accuracy of the report.A new form HMDA-2 and accompanying instructions have been added for useby the newly covered institutions. This additional form is intended toavoid confusion since these institutions will not report FHA loans. TheBoard proposes to provide an optional form, HMDA-2A, that may be used bymortgage banking subsidiaries and service corporations that wish to maintaina public record of their FHA lending activity. Use of the form would beentirely optional; it would not be submitted to supervisory agencies, butinstead could be made available to the public at the institution's ownoffices along with the required HMDA data.Appendix B_Federal Supervisory AgenciesAppendix B of the current regulation contains detailed material relatingto applications for state exemptions. The Board proposes deleting it tosimplify the regulation. In its place, a reference to the availabilityof state exemptions has been added to andSection; 203.3.Current Appendix A, which lists enforcement agencies, has been designatedas Appendix B. The Board proposes to amend the appendix by adding provisionsto specify that mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank holding companiesshall submit HMDA reports to the Federal Reserve System, and that savingsand loan service corporations and mortgage banking subsidiaries of savingsand loan holding companies shall submit them to the Federal Home Loan BankSystem. This reporting arrangement is appropriate in view of the FederalReserve's general supervisory responsibility for non-bank subsidiariesof bank holding companies. The same is true, for savings and loan servicecorporations and mortgage banking subsidiaries of savings and loan holdingcompanies, as to the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Absent such specification,the supervisory agency for all of the newly covered instituions would bethe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.In addition, the revised appendix differentiates between federal and statesavings banks, to reflect that state savings banks are under the FDIC'sjurisdiction and federal savings banks under the FHLBB's jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="84">(6) Economic Impact Statement</ITAG>The Board's Division of Research and Statistics has prepared an economicimpact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation C.
