Guerrilla leaders denied that the bloodiest battle in thedecade-long war was over.   There was no way to independently verify either claim.   Jalalabad, the capital of Nangahar province and once thecountry's fifth-largest city, came under rocket and artillerybombardment March 7, three weeks after Soviet troops leftAfghanistan and ended their nine-year intervention.   ``We have conquered Jalalabad from the opponents,'' said ForeignMinistry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani, quoting the province'smilitary commander, Gen. Asif Delawar.   In Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, guerrilla spokesmanAzim Nasser-Zia of the moderate National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan said of the government claim, ``It's certainly nottrue.''   Abdul Rahim, a spokesman for the more fundamentalistJamiat-i-Islami, added: ``The siege is not over. But if they'retalking about opening part of the Jalalabad highway, that may betrue.'' He also spoke from Pakistan.   He was referring to the battles for control of the key supplyroute between Pakistan and Kabul, the capital. Government forceshave succeeded in pushing through any number of supply and weaponsconvoys, but the guerrillas have periodically regained control andsealed off the road.   An editor for the Afghan News Agency, an organ of hard-lineguerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, called the report``propaganda.'' He did not want to be quoted by name.   Amani said government forces had pushed the guerrillas about 15miles east. ``The government's mopping up operations are stillcontinuing. Every day we are able to destroy deserted rebel posts,bunkers and their other hideouts,'' he said.   ``Day by day, the number of attacks on Jalalabad is decreasingrapidly,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. ``More and morepeople are coming to their fields to work. This is a definite signthat things are getting better and normal there.''   However, he added, government troops still need time to clear thearea.   ``There may still exist isolated rebel positions on the outskirtsof the city,'' he said. ``Our military aim is to push the rebelsfurther toward the frontier, and we are succeeding.''   Jalalabad, which had a population of 64,600, is 75 miles east ofKabul and 45 miles west of Pakistan.   When the siege began, guerrilla leaders predicted the city wouldfall in three days, giving them a base for an interim government andpaving the way for the final drive to Kabul.   The rebels captured several key outposts in the early fighting.But they failed to unite into a cohesive force capable of mounting asustained attack.   The guerrillas have been fighting to topple the Soviet-backedgovernment since it seized power in an April 1978 coup. More than1.3 million Afghans have died in the fighting.   Also today, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the U.S. StateDepartment should send a representative to Kabul to negotiate therelease of a captured American photographer.   The government initially did not name the photographer,identifying him only as a U.S. journalist. Rebel sources in Pakistanidentified him as Tony O'Brien, a freelancer from Santa Fe, N.M., onan assignment for Time-Life Inc.   The government later acknowledged today on state-run Radio Kabulthat it was O'Brien who was being held.   Radio Kabul said O'Brien was captured June 8 on the outskirts ofKabul. Rebel sources in Pakistan, however, claimed the arrest wasmade June 14. It was not possible to clarify the discrepency.   The government accused the photographer of illegally entering thecountry without a visa and being in company of armed guerrillas.   At least three Western journalists and two foreign aid workershave been captured while traveling with rebels during the war. Allwere released unharmed. O'Brien is the first American captured.</TEXT></DOC>
