We provethat in both cases there are no regular spatially compact solutions.The U(1) global string admits no asymptotically well-behaved solutions,whereas {sigma}-model strings can be constructed under certain assumptions.Finally we present some singular solutions and show that one of themcorresponds to a physical global string.</TEXT></DOC>
