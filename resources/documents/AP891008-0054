(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's evidence an automatic fire alarmsystem may not have worked when a blaze broke out last week at anursing home, killing nine, authorities said.   A preliminary investigation of the fire indicates the system _which also is supposed to automatically close the building's firedoors _ never sent an alarm out of Hillhaven Rehabilitation andConvalescent Center, city Fire Marshal Carl Welch said. The firedepartment instead heard about the blaze via telephone calls.   ``There seems to be some confusion on whether the fire alarmsworked correctly,'' said Jeffrey McKain, vice president of the home.   Nine of the home's 160 residents were killed and 98 injuredThursday when a 78-year-old patient accidentally tossed a match onhis bed while smoking cigarettes in his second-floor room, inviolation of the home's rules. The man was among those who died.   ``It looks like the main alarm had not been tripped,'' Welchsaid. He said Sunday that investigators were trying to determine iffire officials or anyone else reset the alarm after the blaze.   The possible alarm malfunction also may have prevented firedoors in the nursing home from closing, Welch said. Fire doors areordinarily kept open with electric magnets until tripped by firealarms, McKain said.   Welch said Sunday that investigators were still determiningwhether the fire doors did indeed fail to close. The fire wasconfined largely to one room, but thick smoke surged through otherparts of the building, and most of the deaths were due to smokeinhalation.   The automatic alarm system is linked to MGI Security ServicesInc., which is supposed to relay calls to the city fire department.   Welch said MGI officials had not indicated whether the alarmreached the company. Investigators planned to look at the company'srecords Monday, he said.   A woman who answered the telephone Sunday at MGI and refused togive her name said only one employee was authorized to answerquestions about the fire, and he would not be available for commentuntil Monday.   Two of the injured nursing home patients remained in criticalcondition Sunday at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, nursingsupervisor Mary Dadell said. A third was in serious condition andseven others were in satisfactory condition, she said.   Firefighters were called to the nursing home by four telephonecalls from employees to the emergency 911 line, Welch said. But hestressed that firefighters were able to respond quickly.   ``The fire still was confined to one room,'' Welch said Sunday.``In a facility like that, if we can do that, we did good.''   The brick nursing home was not required to have fire sprinklersbecause it was built 20 years ago, but McKain said fire sprinklerswill be added within six months. The nursing home had passed twostate inspections this year and held fire drills each month.   McKain said Hillhaven held monthly fire drills as required byregulations, and a staff training session on evacuation techniqueswas held about two hours before the fire.   Patients who were not injured in the fire were taken to othernursing homes.</TEXT></DOC>
