The Kansas Republican blames New Hampshire miscues on his staff and privately assails campaign chairman Brock. Dole's problems are typified by his failure to field more than a third of his delegates in Tennessee. He hopes to beat Bush in a Florida showdown, but even there the vice president enjoys a big organizational advantage.    Robertson remains the biggest threat on the right as Kemp struggles to survive. The religious broadcaster hopes for a surprise showing in one of Bush's home states, Maine. But in South Carolina, he fails to win the backing of fundamentalists surrounding Bob Jones University; they look askance at charismatic practices such as speaking in tongues.    Bush's links to Panamanian dictator Noriega may pose a bigger threat to him than lingering Iran-Contra questions.    MORE GROWTH may deter the Fed from easing interest rates further.    Some signs suggest that the economy isn't slowing as much as some had expected. December retail sales were stronger than initially reported, exports continue to rise and factory orders are building up. Some economists speculate that next week the Commerce Department may even raise its 1987 fourth-quarter growth estimate.    The Fed won't take further interest-cutting action without &quot;convincing signs of deep production cutbacks or a drop-off in consumer expenditures,&quot; predicts economist Samuel Kahan. Its recent slight easing prompts White House economist Beryl Sprinkel to add a sentence to his annual economic report, due out today, praising the Fed for &quot;being more supportive of economic growth.&quot;    PACIFYING PAKISTAN becomes a key to Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.    U.S. officials say that the Pakistanis fear that the remaining Afghan government will become a permanent source of instability. &quot;They fear a Lebanon on their borders whose chaos runs over to Pakistani territory,&quot; says one official. They also worry that Congress may threaten Pakistan's $4 billion aid package once it is no longer the conduit for U.S. aid to the Afghan resistance.    The Pakistani concerns could hinder Shultz's efforts to nail down details of a Soviet withdrawal when he visits Moscow this weekend. To help ease worries about border violence, Shultz could press Moscow to cut off military supplies to Afghan forces if the U.S. quits arming the resistance.    &quot;Maybe that would make the withdrawal easier for the Pakistanis to swallow,&quot; a U.S. official says.    HOLD ONE FOR THE GEPPER? Congress won't take up Gephardt's controversial trade-bill amendment until after the Super Tuesday Southern primaries on March 8. Many fellow House members don't want to interfere with his presidential campaign. Lawmakers also want to see how his protectionist posture sells to voters.    HAROLD HART? Hart hopes to surprise with strong showings in Wyoming, where only 3,500 Democrats took part in the 1984 caucus, and in Maine. But most Democratic analysts say that he is succeeding only in turning himself into a laughingstock. Says one: &quot;We have our own Harold Stassen.&quot;    AIDS REPORT: The first recommendations of Reagan's AIDS commission this month will urge increased federal spending for clinics, hospices and other out-of-hospital programs for AIDS victims. AIDS activists who criticized the panel become more optimistic but wait to see if the proposals get White House backing.    BAD TIMING: At a time it seeks support for wider powers, the SEC steps on toes. A dispute with the IRS over insider-trader profits ends up in court. Grumbles grow in Congress about SEC &quot;arrogance.&quot; A pro forma SEC response to a request by 12 congressmen prompts GOP Rep. Bliley to fire off an angry letter to SEC Chairman Ruder.    IT'S NOT EASY being green -- or a lesser-light cabinet member.    To gain attention, Transportation Secretary Burnley joins Kermit the Frog to promote child safety seats in cars and dons goggles to inspect a crack in a St. Lawrence Seaway lock. Housing chief Pierce holds a press conference to present a Pueblo, Colo., couple with an oversized copy of the 100,000th housing-subsidy voucher.    New Commerce Secretary Verity plans a party aboard the former presidential yacht Sequoia to celebrate the Commerce Department's 75th birthday. But some efforts hit snags. Agriculture chief Lyng, on a Far East tour, arrived in Singapore recently just as the U.S. abruptly ended the duty-free status of that nation's exports to America; he bore the brunt of Singapore anger.    To new Labor Secretary McLaughlin, cabinet status means never having to say you're sorry; she issues a memo forbidding letters signed by her to begin with an apology.    MINOR MEMOS: After Bush urges rivals to &quot;give peace a chance,&quot; Kemp aides wonder if the vice president will invite Yoko Ono to prepare him for the next debate. . . . City planners, the American Planning Association reports, want a U.S. president &quot;who is a devoted environmentalist, a humanitarian&quot; and &quot;a transportation infrastructure enthusiast.&quot; . . . A fund-raiser for Kansas Rep. Glickman is billed as &quot;$500 per person (if you want him to sing), $1,000 per person (if you don't want him to sing).&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
