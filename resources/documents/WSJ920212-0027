But they haven't been to the Olympics.</LP><TEXT>   Isabelle Nove has been standing in subfreezingtemperatures at a parking lot for three hours, waiting for aride home to Lyon. To avoid traffic jams, the Olympicsorganizers have barred cars before and after events at mostsites. Instead, people are supposed to take special buses.   The problem is, the system isn't working very well. Andnow, at 10 p.m., Miss Nove's long day is turning into a longnight. &quot;I wish I had never come,&quot; she says. &quot;The organizerssaid they had everything under control. But they don't. Theyare terrible.&quot;   The scene is chaos. Hundreds of people stumble around inthe darkness, unsure of how they will get back to theirhotels or homes. There are no signs to guide them, and thewhole system is supervised by a handful of officials who seemas confused as anyone else. People are yelling at each other;the crowd turns into a frantic scrum when somebody -- oftenjust a hopeful passenger -- shouts the name of a destination.   If Kafka had liked parking lots, he would have loved thisone.   &quot;This is the worst mess I have ever seen,&quot; says MaryMoran, doctor for the U.S. biathlon team. Wearing a U.S.Olympic team parka and with several official credentialshanging around her neck, she -- if anyone -- ought to be ableto get transportation back to her Olympic lodgings at LesSaisies 20 miles away.   Not so. She's been waiting for two hours with no sign of abus. &quot;This is the sort of thing that ruins the experience ofthe Olympics,&quot; she says.   &quot;That's the French,&quot; she adds. &quot;Great art, lousyorganization.&quot;   Most everyone was surprised in 1986 when the Savoy regionwon the right to hold the 16th Winter Games. Never before hadthe International Olympic Committee allowed so many differentevents to be held in so many different places -- 10 towns --spread across 600 square miles of the most rugged mountainsof Europe. A million people are expected during the two-weekGames, joining the 370,000 or so who live here.   This layout makes these Games by far the most ambitious inhistory. But high up in the Alps everything has to be truckedin -- people, food, supplies. It was always going to be anhuge task to keep things moving. Skeptics said it couldn't bedone.   And they may have been right.   Some Olympics competitors say the dispersal of the eventsleaves them feeling as if they were at a scattered series ofworld championships, rather than enjoying fellowship withother athletes as at past Olympics.   For the Olympic movement, Albertville's lasting legacywill be to raise questions about whether the Olympics shouldever be held in such a decentralized manner. In addition tothe practical difficulties, the distances have everybody,including athletes, grumbling that they can only experienceone or two sports. Athletes are often living miles away fromteammates and other competitors.   &quot;The Olympic spirit doesn't really exist at these Games.It feels more like a world championship, not an Olympics,&quot;says Peter Jenoure, doctor for the Swiss National OlympicsTeam. &quot;It is pretty clear that Games should be morecentralized than this.&quot;   Competitors may not like it, but the International OlympicCommittee, under pressure from environmentalists not to buildmore infrastructure such as bobsled runs and ski jumps, hassaid it will consider whether dispersed Winter Games couldbecome the rule rather than the exception.   Here, the big distances are having a practical effect.Some Swiss athletes missed the opening ceremonies becausethey couldn't get to the stadium on time. Suppliers have hadto make deliveries either before dawn or after midnight toavoid Olympic roadblocks. Even with special buses,journalists face two-hour commutes with as many as threetransfers to get to Olympic sites. It took longer than thatto get back to Meribel from Sunday's opening ceremonies.   But the spectators, like Andrew Martin, from Canberra,Australia, have it the worst. &quot;I have to get up at 5 a.m. toget to the skiing events, 6 a.m. for luge,&quot; he says on apost-midnight bus ride back to his hotel in Meribel.   The best way to enjoy these Games is to buy a pair ofskis. On a ski run at Meribel, Jean-Pierre Hurl is watchingthe women's downhill practice with his son Roland and abouttwo dozen other skiers. &quot;We have tickets for the competition,but I am beginning to think we would be stupid to use them.We get a much better view from right here on the slopes,&quot;says Mr. Hurl.   Some are taking the idea further and commuting to eventson skis. From Meribel, a good skier can get to half a dozenevents simply by schussing to the nearby resorts ofCourchevel and Les Menuires. It's sunny, the skiing is goodand there's no waiting for a bus.   Thus far, the Olympic organizers are congratulatingthemselves because of what hasn't happened. There haven'tbeen huge traffic jams, or fights between tourists and theFrench gendarmes who man the roadblocks into the Olympicvillages.   But the organizers are still holding their breath. In aninterview, spokeswoman Claudie Blanc adds: &quot;We are stillanxious.&quot;   They have reason to be. Thus far, there've been noblizzards like the recent ones that left villages snowboundand brought transportation to a halt. Officials are keepingtheir fingers crossed and everyone is thinking: &quot;Heaven helpus if it snows.&quot;   Yesterday, snow started to fall.</TEXT></DOC>
