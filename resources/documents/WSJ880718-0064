Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BIO </IN><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   How does Michael Dukakis relax? &quot;Easy,&quot; says Massachusetts House Speaker George Keverian. &quot;Booze and broads.&quot;    Then he leans back in his chair here in the handsome old Statehouse, and his huge body shakes with laughter.    The very idea -- booze and broads and Gov. Dukakis -- is ludicrous. Mr. Dukakis, who will accept the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night in Atlanta, rarely drinks and is clearly devoted to his wife, Kitty.    &quot;I'll tell you what he does to relax,&quot; says Speaker Keverian, no longer laughing. &quot;He reads reports. We spend $19 million a year for reports. I never read any of them. He reads them all. He's our designated report reader.&quot;    &quot;He can't wait to dig into his 'in' basket Monday morning,&quot; says Hale Champion, the governor's chief of staff.    &quot;Michael,&quot; says Mr. Dukakis's 84-year-old mother, Euterpe, &quot;is a serious man.&quot;    Michael Stanley Dukakis, 54, is a hardworking, ambitious, self-disciplined, professional politician. Some of Mr. Dukakis's traits inevitably invite comparisons with former President Jimmy Carter. Both are smart, tough-minded, humorless, self-righteous men who seem more comfortable with details than with sweeping themes. Both moved from state legislatures to governorships.    But the differences run far deeper. Mr. Dukakis is much more experienced than Mr. Carter was in 1976. Nor does he appear to worry too much about God's calling: Though he went to Sunday School at the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Boston until he was 14, organized religion is no longer an important part of his life. And, unlike Mr. Carter, Mr. Dukakis is a supremely self-confident man who usually surrounds himself with first-class advisers.    Even his enemies acknowledge that Mr. Dukakis is very bright, with a wide-ranging mind that absorbs facts easily. He rarely suffers self-doubt, not even in dealing with subjects -- foreign policy particularly -- in which he has little experience.    He can be ruthless. His career path is littered with the bodies of close advisers who were tossed aside. &quot;He is always able to move on,&quot; says John De Villars, his chief of operations. &quot;I have great admiration for him, but my life and my career are my responsibility, not his.&quot;    His first term as governor was something of a disaster. He was puritanical: When campaign volunteer Alexis Maas was hired as a member of the staff, he complained: &quot;Why did we hire that blond bombshell?&quot; (Ms. Maas, by all accounts a good worker, is now Mrs. Johnny Carson.) He was impossibly idealistic: opening cabinet meetings to the press and TV, for example, so that nothing was ever accomplished, and refusing on ethical grounds to appoint his political mentor, Sumner Kaplan, to a judgeship.    In his 1978 bid for re-election, he was defeated in the primary, a humiliation he won't ever forget. Now, he compromises. &quot;If a leaf flew in the window, he'd sign it,&quot; says John Parker, the Republican leader of the state senate. He still wants to win, but now he is more cautious about the kinds of victories he seeks, and he knows that he sometimes must pay a price to achieve them.    He is frugal in his personal habits, and he cares almost nothing about the trappings of high office. He is generally without artifice or affectation. He gets along comfortably with his stepson, John, and his daughters, Andrea and Kara. &quot;More than any politician I've known,&quot; says Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, &quot;the image he conveys in public matches the one you see in private.&quot;    For a man who takes pride in his powers of observation and his mastery of detail, a puzzle remains: How did he fail to recognize that his wife was addicted to diet pills, a habit she finally kicked after 25 years? Pills are easy to hide, Mrs. Dukakis has said.    &quot;I'm a guy,&quot; says Mr. Dukakis, who starts many of his sentences that way, &quot;who loves politics.&quot; But he loves politics in a special way. Unlike many Massachusetts politicians -- Tip O'Neill, for example -- he doesn't care for banter or anecdotes. &quot;I'm a doer,&quot; he says, again and again. But not necessarily a doer of great deeds; he is a practical man.    &quot;He knows more about the delivery of new subway cars for the Red Line than I do,&quot; says Frederick P. Salvucci, the state's secretary of transportation.    He has a passion for tidiness. A month ago, driving to Worcester, the governor was impressed by the cleanliness of the roadside. &quot;As soon as we stopped,&quot; says Mr. Salvucci, &quot;he was on the phone to the district highway engineer, offering his congratulations.&quot;    &quot;I'll tell you this,&quot; says Senate President William Bulger, &quot;if he's elected president, we're going to have a tidy country.&quot;    &quot;He's got that Greek work ethic,&quot; says Nicholas Mitropoulos, the governor's executive assistant. &quot;It's just like the guy who runs the pizza parlor. He gets up at seven every morning and works every day until 11 at night.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis is, in fact, a first-generation American. His father, Panos, arrived in New York in 1912, at the age of 16. His mother arrived a year later, when she was nine.    Twelve years after clearing Ellis Island, Panos Dukakis graduated from Harvard Medical School. Euterpe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Bates College, in Maine, in 1925. They were married in 1929. Dr. Dukakis died in 1979.    Mrs. Dukakis taught school, and she says she never forgot the words of Guy Williams, her first superintendent. &quot;Every child,&quot; Mr. Williams said, &quot;has a right to be well-bred, well-fed and well-led.&quot;    The family settled in Brookline, a close-in Boston suburb, where Michael and his older brother, Stelian, were reared strictly by the book. Stelian suffered a nervous breakdown at Bates and was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1973.    &quot;We were at Brookline High School together,&quot; says Beryl Cohen, a Boston lawyer (and a political ally until Mr. Dukakis ran against him for public office). &quot;But I never saw Michael after 5 p.m. Where did he go?&quot;    He went home, of course. &quot;Dinner was at 6 o'clock in the kitchen, because that's where his father liked to eat,&quot; says Euterpe Dukakis. &quot;We listened to the evening news on the radio. That was it. No more radio. Michael went upstairs and did his lessons. He never failed to prepare his lessons&quot; -- and he got straight A's. And then, says Mrs. Dukakis, he practiced his trumpet -- with the doors closed.    On many of those same evenings, Beryl Cohen was hanging out with classmates down at Coolidge Corner at Jack and Marion's, a deli that stayed open until 2 a.m. &quot;I never saw him there -- or anywhere else,&quot; says Mr. Cohen.    &quot;Michael came from a home of highly motivated parents,&quot; says Euterpe Dukakis. &quot;He had good examples to work with.&quot;    Mrs. Dukakis, something of a grande dame, becomes indignant at any suggestion that her son was, well, a nerd.    &quot;He was a typical little boy,&quot; she says. &quot;He loved sports, and he and Stelian were both good athletes, involved in a lot of sibling rivalry. He was always warm and compassionate and easy to talk to.&quot;    But the Dukakis home on Rangeley Road -- Mrs. Dukakis still lives there by herself -- wasn't exactly typical. Dr. Dukakis worked seven days a week, &quot;doing very well by the 1940s,&quot; according to Mrs. Dukakis. But the parents never wanted to show off their success. &quot;We resisted 'keeping up with the Joneses,'&quot; she says.    They bought the house for $12,500 cash. It's worth $400,000 now, Euterpe Dukakis says. They never bought anything on credit. &quot;When my husband was hospitalized after an automobile accident,&quot; she continues, &quot;the only thing we owed was that week's grocery bill.&quot;    But, she insists, her husband was not &quot;stingy or cheap,&quot; and her son isn't either. Michael is simply being frugal like his father when he buys suits off the rack at Filene's basement and takes the trolley to work and continues to live in a duplex in a less upscale section of Brookline.    Mr. Dukakis is a remarkably parochial politician for someone who is about to campaign for president of the whole nation. His world revolves around Brookline and Boston. &quot;I'm a guy with a lot of roots,&quot; he says. &quot;Wild horses wouldn't drag me away.&quot; He pauses a moment. &quot;Except . . . &quot; he says, a little sheepishly, and he doesn't need to add that he's thinking about taking up residence on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.    Apart from a stint in the Army in postwar Korea, his only prolonged absence was the four years he spent at Swarthmore College, a small, selective school, with Quaker roots, near Philadelphia. He didn't really discover the rest of America until he logged 325,000 miles flying around it running for the Democratic nomination.    A little creek called the Crum wanders through the bosky dales of the Swarthmore campus. In later years, when Swarthmore was a hotbed of radical agitation, Vice President Spiro Agnew called it &quot;the Kremlin on the Crum.&quot; But when Michael Dukakis arrived, his suitcase packed with white T-shirts, chinos and white socks, it was a peaceful place with a faintly liberal faculty and a faintly conservative student body. Young Michael took to it like a duck to Crum Creek.    Initially, he had vague thoughts of becoming a doctor. But after getting a D in physics, he gave that up and settled, in his second semester, on politics.    &quot;He was from the start more serious than most of the rest of us,&quot; recalls Ann Jansen, one of his classmates and now an assistant school superintendent in Radnor, Pa. &quot;There was no question Michael had a mission. I heard him say that he'd be governor of Massachusetts one day. He's the only person I've ever known who had a goal of that magnitude and made it.&quot;    Mrs. Jansen remembers that she and her friends would sometimes meet for beer and pizza at the Turf Villa. &quot;But Michael was never a part of that.&quot;    Lee Whitaker, another contemporary and now director of psychological services at Swarthmore, remembers a course in introductory psychology. &quot;We were given a very demanding text,&quot; says Mr. Whitaker. &quot;It was filled, densely, with terms and definitions and concepts. 'Well,' Michael said, 'I'm spending 20 minutes on each chapter. I've just got time for a B.' And I think that's the mark he got.    &quot;Michael,&quot; he concludes, &quot;had an extreme sense of his priorities.&quot;    Even so, he had his diversions. He made the baseball squad but never actually played in a game. He switched to cross-country, and turned out to be a pretty fair runner. And his roommate, Frank Sieverts, remembers his putting on a serape and capering down the dorm corridor, doing &quot;The Mexican Hat Dance.&quot;    Mr. Sieverts, now the spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, swears that the young Dukakis amused his friends by doing an impression of Boston Mayor James Michael Curley giving a speech, and an even better impression of Cardinal Richard Cushing mumbling the rosary on a Boston radio program.    Swarthmore was exposed daily to Republican machine politics in Philadelphia and, closer to home, in suburban Delaware County. That contact helped attract Mr. Dukakis to reformers -- the kind who abhor machine politics, patronage and things that don't work.    His first campaign outing was as a volunteer for Joseph Sill Clark, an aristocrat and a classic reformer, in the mayoral campaign that toppled the corrupt GOP machine in Philadelphia. He then became the campus leader for Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson in 1952. As a member of the college debate club, he argued (as noted in the student newspaper, the Phoenix) that Gov. Stevenson should be elected because &quot;the records show that Stevenson was a reformer who . . . did much to clean up Illinois.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis graduated from Swarthmore &quot;with highest honors.&quot; One of his classmates, Howard Temin, a Nobel laureate in medicine, had managed only &quot;high honors.&quot; After serving in the Army and graduating from Harvard Law School, Mr. Dukakis waded into Brookline politics as a reformer himself.    He and a number of other rebellious colleagues led off by challenging the somnolent members of the town's Democratic committee, and won. &quot;There were no issues involved,&quot; says Mr. Cohen, who was around then for the fight. &quot;They were simply 'outs' and they wanted to be 'ins.' &quot; After tasting that success, they went on to &quot;reform&quot; the state party, with considerable success. Again, there were no burning issues.    &quot;Don't call Michael Dukakis a liberal,&quot; says former U.S. Rep. Michael Harrington, who is one. &quot;He is a reformer. His interest isn't in broad issues. It's in fine-tuning, in reacting, in responding. It's a mind-set that doesn't change. He'd have been a Progressive in the old days.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis doesn't like to be called a reformer. Mr. De Villars, his Statehouse chief of operations, remembers making some reference in a memo to the governor's reformist instincts. Back came a sharp note from Mr. Dukakis. &quot;I am not a reformist,&quot; he said.    &quot;He believes in change,&quot; Mr. De Villars says, &quot;and he believes in government as a force for effecting change. But he objects to the reformist label because it has a suburban, white-tennis-shoe quality to it. He's a realistic and practical guy.&quot;    When the country was torn by the civil-rights struggle in the 1960s, Mr. Dukakis was pressing for home rule for Massachusetts municipalities and tighter restrictions on residential zoning in Brookline. A decade later, when the country was ravaged by the war in Vietnam, he was fighting for no-fault auto insurance.    Mr. Dukakis objects. &quot;I was one of the first legislators in the country to vote against the bombing of North Vietnam, in 1965. I was a Gene McCarthy {anti-war} delegate in 1968. I was an early supporter of fair housing in Brookline.&quot;    What counts, though, are priorities. &quot;Michael looks at problems he can do something about,&quot; says Francis X. Meaney, one of several close advisers who have been dropped along the way by Mr. Dukakis. &quot;He looks at no-fault insurance. He looks at mass transit. He lives in the now.&quot;    What he has never had the chance to look at are areas presidents look at every day -- foreign policy and national security. He will be forced to learn those things on the job. He doesn't worry much about it, arguing that he studied in Peru and spent 16 months in Korea. &quot;I'm a curious guy,&quot; he says, &quot;and I love languages.&quot; (He speaks four of them.)    Mr. Champion, the chief of staff in the governor's office and an old Washington hand, concedes that Mr. Dukakis might have trouble at first dealing with unfamiliar problems if he is elected president. &quot;He's going to have to recognize there are six or more different cultures in Washington,&quot; says Mr. Champion. &quot;But he'll pick good people, and that's when delegation of authority will become so important.&quot;    In his first, disastrous term as governor, Mr. Dukakis thought he could do just about anything he set out to do -- and ended up achieving little. &quot;Messy,&quot; says state Senate President Bulger. After the searing experience of his 1978 defeat, he was taken in and comforted by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. Teaching there, he says, he learned patience, and he tried to listen to what others were saying. He emerged from that experience to win two successive terms as governor and, this week, the Democratic presidential nomination.    &quot;He doesn't come across now as having all the answers,&quot; says Sen. Bulger. &quot;As the poet says, 'Knowledge comes, wisdom lingers.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
