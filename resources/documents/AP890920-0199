It backed the League's appeal ``for an immediate andcomprehensive cease-fire, the implementation of the securityarrangements and the establishment of the necessary conditions fornational reconciliation in Lebanon.''   The statement supported Arab League efforts to guaranteeLebanon's ``full sovereignty, independence, territorial integrityand national unity,'' but did not mention the presence of Syrian andIsraeli troops in Lebanon.   Council President Paulo Nogueira-Batista of Brazil read out thestatement.   The Arab League sought council endorsement after the SecurityCouncil prodded the League into renewing its peacemaking efforts.   The League's three-member committee on Lebanon _ consisting ofAlgeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia _ had announced on Aug. 1 that itwas suspending its efforts because they had come to ``a dead end.''</TEXT></DOC>
