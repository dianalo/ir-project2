Investigates quantitative changes in surfaceactive substances after forcing 20 cm{sup 3} of surfactant through 88mm{sup 2} cross-section, 80 mm high coal sample over 3 days. Resultsobtained indicate that gas permeability of coal is related to amountof surfactant. Increase in concentration reduces gas permeability andinhibits wetting process. Uniformity in wetting was achieved after submergingcoal in solution for about 30 days. Finds that mineral composition ofwater and higher concentration of surfactant in water significantly affectsmicelle formation. Swelling of coal slightly affects gas permeability.5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
