Parker H. Petit, chairman, chief executive officer and founder of Healthdyne, termed Continental's revised offer inadequate and said the time still wasn't ripe to sell the company. But he said Healthdyne's board, which earlier rejected Continental's $6-a-share offer, would meet within two weeks to discuss the latest bid. &quot;We're going to go through the same process as we did before,&quot; he says.    Jack Rosen, Continental's chairman and chief executive, said the new bid more realistically represented the health-care company's value and might lure Healthdyne officers to the bargaining table.    Continental said it owns about 1.02 million shares, or about 6.9%, of Healthdyne's approximately 14.8 million shares outstanding. The companies haven't been in contact about the latest bid, Mr. Rosen said.    In national over-the-counter trading, Marietta, Ga.-based Healthdyne closed yesterday at $5.875 a share, up 37.5 cents. Continental closed at $6.375 a share, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
