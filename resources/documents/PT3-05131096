As the infant grows into a toddler, the garment      becomes a sleeveless beach robe or sleeved bath robe, providing an      increased useful life for the garment. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a garment for a child which can serve in a      plurality of capacities, as well as serving to accommodate the carrying of      various articles therein. </PAR><PAC>  PRIOR ART </PAC><PAR>  Heretofore numerous versatile garments for children have been proposed. </PAR><PAR>  For example, the Mazur, U.S. Pat. No. 3,965,487 discloses a multi-use      infant garment comprising an upper garment having at least a chest section      and a back section, both of which define a lower edge. A lower garment      which may consist of a bag-like, pant or legging-type garment is also      provided and is detachably secured to the upper garment by fastening      means. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the Mulligan U.S. Pat. No. 4,759,082 discloses a garment for small      children, useable as both day wear and sleepwear. The garment includes a      body portion having a plurality of openings therein for accommodating the      extremities and head of the child. The body portion is dimensioned such      that the extremities may be selectively drawn into the garment. The      opening for the feet may include a drawstring, creating a bunting for an      infant, and a pillow for the child's head is provided as well. </PAR><PAR>  Also, the Perez U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,429 discloses unitary sleepwear which      comprises a two piece night garment including a torso embracing portion      and a lower blanket portion which wraps around the lower torso and snaps      onto the torso embracing portion, to keep a child covered during the night      without restricting mobility. </PAR><PAR>  As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the versatile child's      garment of the present invention comprises an armless torso portion having      a hood and a bottom margin which can be left open or closed, as desired,      and sleeve elements which can be engaged to the torso portion as desired.      Further, a plurality of pockets are provided along a front portion of the      bottom margin, openings into the pockets being elasticized. Depending on      the chosen pattern of engagement of the elements of the garment, it can      serve as a bunting, as a sleeping bag, as a diaper bag or as a changing      blanket for an infant and can later serve as a sleeved or sleeveless bath      or beach robe for a toddler. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  According to the invention there is provided a versatile child's garment      comprising multiple members and including two sleeve members and a torso      portion, the torso portion comprising a rectangular blanket-like structure      having long top and bottom edges and two short side edges, with a hood      being centrally attached along the top edge, the rectangular blanket-like      structure further having two converging edge cutouts extending to a      predetermined distance, one to either side of the hood, the sleeve members      being releasably engageable about the cutouts to form a sleeved garment,      if desired. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent      upon perusal of the detailed description thereof and upon inspection of      the drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of the garment of the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the torso portion of the garment being      folded into a bunting. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross section through the torso portion taken along line 3--3      of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the garment of FIG. 2 showing alignment of      sleeve members to be engaged to the torso portion. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a perspective view showing the torso portion with the sleeve      members engaged thereto. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a perspective view of a bottom margin of the torso portion      showing front forming panels thereof engaged to one another. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a front view of the garment and shows the garment formed into a      bunting and including a self-storing pacifier thereof. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the garment of FIG. 7 and shows the front      pockets of the bunting being filled with baby items. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a view similar to that of FIG. 6 and shows the front forming      panels being engaged to a back forming panel to close the bottom margin of      the torso portion. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawings in greater detail there is illustrated in the      drawings the versatile child's garment of the present invention generally      identified by reference numeral 10. </PAR><PAR>  As shown, the garment 10 basically comprises a torso portion 12, having the      general shape of a rectangular blanket, the torso portion 12 having a hood      14 attached along a long top edge 16 thereof, and including a converging      edge cutout 18 to either side of the hood 14 extending inwardly into the      torso portion 12 from the edge 16. </PAR><PAR>  Two sleeve members 20 are also provided, each of which can be engaged      within one of the converging edge cutouts 18 to form a sleeved garment 10. </PAR><PAR>  All engagements between various elements of the garment 10 are created by      means of cooperating snap sections as will be defined hereinafter. </PAR><PAR>  The torso portion 12, laid out as shown in FIG. 1, acts as a blanket, on      which an infant can be placed for a diaper change, or upon which a toddler      can sit. </PAR><PAR>  Between short side edges 28 of the torso portion 12, there are defined      three panels. Between the converging edge cutouts 18 is defined a back      forming panel 12a. </PAR><PAR>  To the left of back forming panel 12a in FIG. 1 is defined first or inner      front panel 12b and to the right of panel 12a is defined second or outer      front panel 12c. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 2, side edges 28 of the torso portion 12 are shown being brought      together, with panel 12b to underlie panel 12c, forming a front surface 30      (FIGS. 7 and 8) for a bunting-type garment 10 produced upon forming an      engagement between the panels 12a, 12b and 12c. </PAR><PAR>  Now, a heart shaped pocket 32 provided on outer front panel 12c becomes      evident, the pocket 32 storing a pacifier 34 therein, the pacifier 34      being engaged to the garment 10 to prevent its loss by a ribbon 36 or the      like extending into the pocket 32. </PAR><PAR>  To engage inner and outer front panels 12b and 12c together a plurality of      pairs of snap elements 40a are provided on panel 12c and cooperating snap      members 40b are provided on panel 12b. </PAR><PAR>  When cooperating snap members 40a and 40b are engaged to one another, a      bunting garment 10 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 7 begins to take shape. </PAR><PAR>  To provide a cushioning for an infant or child wearing the garment 10, the      garment 10 is formed of an inner lining layer of material 50, an outer      layer of material 52, and an intermediate layer of batting 54 which is      secured to outer layer 52 by known methods, such as quilting. </PAR><PAR>  Obviously, quilted material may be used and lined, with the inner lining      layer of material 50 preferably being made of cotton for comfort, and with      the outer or quilted layer of material 52 preferably being made of a flame      retardant material. </PAR><PAR>  To complete creation of the bunting garment 10, illustrated in FIGS. 7 and      8, further pairs of cooperating snap members 40c and 40d are provided      about the converging edge cutouts 18 to create engagement between the back      panel section 12a and front panel sections 12b and 12c across the cutouts      18. </PAR><PAR>  When these snap members 40c and 40d are engaged, the only opening remaining      in the bunting garment 10 is a bottom opening 60. </PAR><PAR>  To close off the bottom opening 60, snap members 40e  are provided on front      panel 12b and cooperating snap members 40f are provided on back panel 12a.      When engaged as shown in FIG. 9, a closed bottom bunting garment 10 is      created. </PAR><PAR>  Because an infant requires certain items while away from home, a plurality      of outside pockets 62 are provided on front panels 12b and 12c which can      accommodate articles such as formula bottles 64, diapers 66, etc. These      pockets 62 extending upwardly from a bottom margin 68 of the garment 10      and may have openings 70 thereof elasticized, to keep the items from      falling out. </PAR><PAR>  Turning back to FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, it will be understood that, as the infant      grows into a toddler, the child's arms could be freed from being within      the garment 10. Also, as the child's height increases, the legs should be      capable of extending out of the bottom opening 60. </PAR><PAR>  To accommodate this growth, it will first of all be understood that the      bottom margin 68 of the garment could remain open, as shown in FIG. 6,      creating a robe like garment 10 which is sleeveless, such as a beach robe. </PAR><PAR>  If a sleeve garment 10 is desired, such as for use as a bath robe, snap      members 40c and 40d are disengaged from one another and are instead each      engaged to coacting snap members 40g or 40h, respectively, provided on      each sleeve member 20. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the useful life of the garment 10 extends well into the toddler      years, the pockets 62 now accommodating toys and the like. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, the garment 10 of the present invention provides      significant advantages, some of which have been described above and others      of which are inherent in the invention. Also, modifications may be      proposed to the garment 10 without departing from the teachings herein. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the scope of the invention is only to be limited as      necessitated by the accompanying claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
