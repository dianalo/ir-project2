As a &quot;contribution&quot; to the U.S. war effort, Hong Kong hasbeen strong-armed into agreeing to slash its textile exportsto the U.S. by the equivalent of 16 million shirts.Representatives of the Korean and Taiwan governments confirmthat U.S. government officials are pressuring them also tosanctify America's victory by sharply reducing textileexports. The U.S. request has exasperated some Koreans, sinceKorea already gave $500 million in cash and in-kindcontributions to help the Gulf War effort.</LP><TEXT>   On July 16, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representativeannounced that Hong Kong had agreed to &quot;reduce its access tothe U.S. market by 27 million square meter equivalents as acontribution&quot; to the U.S. war effort. &quot;Square meterequivalents&quot; are official estimates of the quantity orpoundage of textile products that different clothing andtextile imports contain. According to the fine print of U.S.textile restraint agreements, 27 million square meters isequivalent to 16 million shirts, or 81 million brassieres, or112 million pairs of cotton mittens. Hong Kong could loseroughly $125 million in exports to the U.S.   The U.S. is seeking to &quot;compensate&quot; for Turkey's increasedexports by reducing other countries' exports. Given the U.S.government's method of measuring the textile content of thehundreds of different products restricted by textile importquotas, this could lead to some peculiar tradeoffs: If Turkeyexports 50,000 extra pounds of yarns and sewing thread to theU.S., for instance, Hong Kong could be required to export onemillion fewer handkerchiefs. If Turkey exports 100,000 morepounds of tampons, Korea could be required to cut its fishnet exports by 62,539 pounds. Or, if Turkey exports an extra20,000 negligees, Taiwan could be pressured to slash itstyping ribbon exports by 10,000 pounds.   Patriotism is the best refuge of a protectionist. Foreigngovernments have said nothing publicly to criticize the U.S.government's latest anti-import charade because they fear abacklash from the American public. American importers havealso been uncharacteristically mute on an issue that is vitalto their pocketbooks. Potential critics fear that opposingthe new restrictions on East Asian exports might get themportrayed as closet Saddam-sympathizers. But the Americanpublic is being hurt by trade restrictions. The President'sCouncil of Economic Advisers estimates that trade restraintsboost the price of imported clothing by 50%.   What will the government do next to help Americanscelebrate the mother of all victories? Pressure Mexico tosell us fewer bottles of tequila? Bludgeon Honduras to stopsending us bananas? Arm-twist Finland into slashing itsexports of ice-hockey pucks?   A war that was fought to protect America's ability to buyimported oil is being perverted to further restrictAmerican's freedom to buy imported clothing. Perhaps thesecret goal of U.S. trade policy is to have low-incomeAmericans wearing clothes that are as tattered as therefugees from the Iraq war.   ---   Mr. Bovard writes frequently on trade policy.</TEXT></DOC>
