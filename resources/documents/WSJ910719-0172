At issue is who pays for about $1 billion in fraudulentcharges rung up annually after hackers or others cracksecurity codes to a company's internal telephone system,known as a private branch exchange, or PBX.</LP><TEXT>   As new phone services are rolled out and new technologiesproliferate, the opportunities for break-ins are growing. Andwhen those breaches occur, &quot;A lot of finger-pointing takesplace,&quot; says Rami Abuhamdeh, executive director of theCommunications Fraud Control Association, in McLean, Va.&quot;Companies blame their long-distance carrier or the localphone company, the vendor that made the equipment, orsometimes their own internal telecommunications people.&quot;   Most companies don't want to publicize breaches in theirsecurity, Mr. Abuhamdeh says. But many companies, stung byhundreds of thousands of dollars in long-distance charges,are fighting to make phone companies absorb the charges.Telephone companies respond that their tariffs are explicit:Customers are responsible for unauthorized use of PBXs.   Last month, Mitsubishi International Corp. filed a $10million suit against American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,claiming it failed to disclose the pitfalls of switchingequipment it leased to the Japanese company's New York-basedunit. Once the troubles began, Mitsubishi says, ATandamp;T didn'tresolve them quickly. (ATandamp;T declines comment on theMitsubishi suit but maintains that customers can control useof their equipment and are responsible for unauthorizedcalls.)   The onset of the fraud against Mitsubishi was in July1990. At that time, Mitsubishi employees were sometimesmysteriously blocked from dialing the 800 number andremote-access code that allowed them to make long-distancecalls when they were away from the office. ATandamp;T was called into investigate, and by the end of July the possibility wasraised that Mitsubishi's PBX system had been compromised insome way. Extra security steps were taken to protect thesystem.   In late September, Mitsubishi says, calling data disclosedthat hackers had made more than one million calls toMitsubishi's PBX, most of the calls lasting only moments; thehackers were repeatedly trying different numbers to break thesecurity code, the company says. Despite the extra security,Mitsubishi says, the hackers succeeded and about 30,000 callswere placed through its PBX to oversees destinations,primarily in Pakistan and Egypt.   By the end of September, Mitsubishi decided all it coulddo was shut off the remote-access feature of its PBX and askemployees to use phone credit cards. By then, unauthorizedcalls totaled $430,000. In addition, the company figures itcosts an additional $30,000 a month to use calling cards. Buttelephone credit cards have an advantage: If the number isstolen, the long-distance carrier absorbs the loss.   Earlier this year, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co.brought its case to the Federal Communications Commission,arguing that phone companies should pick up part of the costof unauthorized calls because hackers use the public phonenetwork to enter a company's PBX. Pacific Mutual was hit formore than $200,000 in phone charges after hackers broke thecode for its PBX's remote-access feature. ATandamp;T and PacificBell, a unit of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group,say Pacific Mutual must pay the entire amount.   Pacific Mutual wants a ceiling on charges phone customerspay for calls placed by those who tap into companies' PBXs.The Newport Beach, Calif., insurer also asked the FCC torequire PBX makers such as ATandamp;T and Northern Telecom Ltd. todisclose in writing the extent of the equipment'svulnerability as well as security steps that buyers can take.   Pacific Mutual's petition was supported by other companiesvictimized by toll fraud, including Perkin-Elmer Corp.,Norwalk, Conn. Perkin-Elmer told the agency it took all thesecurity steps recommended by ATandamp;T and by Northern Telecom,which made its PBX, and still was clobbered with more than$250,000 in fraudulent charges. ATandamp;T says the Perkin-Elmercase was recently settled and included an agreement not todisclose terms.   The FCC has yet to decide on Pacific Mutual's petition butin the past has sided with the phone companies. For instance,in May the agency found Chartway Technologies, a unit of ICFInternational, liable for nearly $82,000 in charges forunauthorized calls routed through a Northern Telecom PBX toATandamp;T's network.   Phone companies maintain that if they end up footing thebill for PBX fraud, phone rates for everyone will rise. Tohead off trouble, carriers have stepped up seminars and otherprograms that show customer ways to detect and prevent fraud.&quot;The best way to avoid conflicts with customers is to educatethem,&quot; says Jim Snyder, a former deputy chief counsel for theSecret Service who now works for MCI Communications Corp.   Sometimes, the modifications are as simple as addingdigits to the access codes employees dial to use theirvoice-mail or long-distance service. Generally,telecommunications executives are warned to monitor theirPBXs closely, watching for unusual activity such as hundredsof short incoming calls or international calls to unusualdestinations.   Stolen access codes are gold mines to those who run&quot;call-sell&quot; operations from banks of pay phones or out ofapartments, typically in neighborhoods of recent immigrants.Neighbors can stop by and place a call home for $5 to $10,substantially cheaper than dialing direct.   Even with tough security measures and vigilant monitoring,the problem won't go away, the phone companies and lawenforcement authorities concede. One part of the problem isthat call-sell operators who are caught usually get lightsentences, perhaps a fine and community service. &quot;The guys onthe street are smart,&quot; says Mr. Snyder. &quot;There are only acouple of ways they can make $10,000 a week -- and sellingillegal phone calls isn't likely to get them a jailsentence.&quot;   What's more, law-enforcement authorities are swamped withviolent crimes and don't assign a high priority to phonefraud involving PBX circumvention. &quot;We don't work that manyof these cases,&quot; concedes Earl Devaney, special agent incharge of the Secret Service's fraud division. &quot;A lot have somany dead ends that it's not worth our while to pursue them.&quot;Nevertheless, the Secret Service has actively pursued othertypes of telephone fraud -- notably cellular-phone fraud --when it involves other crimes such as drug dealing.   Drug dealing, illegal gambling or other crimes are hard totrace when either cellular phones or PBXs are used. &quot;Drugdealers want to be anonymous and will often give out phonecodes {to as many people as possible} . . . so that theircalls get lost in the deluge,&quot; says MCI's Mr. Snyder.   Hackers are a wily lot, Mr. Snyder says. Often they willmake calls through two or more PBXs, confusing investigators.For years they have been using electronic bulletin boards toshare such programs as Auto Hack and Phone Phreak, both usedto break into phone systems. Lately, they have even figuredout how to use some voice-mail and automatic-answeringsystems to make long-distance calls.   Robert Fox, US Sprint's assistant vice president forcorporate security, says his company has spotted customers'names and access codes on electronic bulletin boards. Unlikeother carriers, Sprint monitors inbound 800 calls, alertingcustomers of unusual activity.   But even shutting off the remote-access feature andregular monitoring won't stop break-ins. &quot;Some hackers haveturned on remote access,&quot; says Mr. Fox. They have figured outhow to tap into a PBX using the same steps the PBX's makerwould to monitor or maintain the system.   &quot;Whatever safeguards are put into telephone products,we're always playing catch up,&quot; says the Secret Service's Mr.Devaney. &quot;It's a cat-and-mouse game at the moment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
