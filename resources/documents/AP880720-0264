CARLSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actress Cicely Tyson will be looking for food forthe soul, while actor Ossie Davis says the first National BlackArts Festival promises an opportunity for black artists to shine asnever before.   Black artists and audiences will feast on events ranging fromthe world premiere of Pulitzer Prize-winner Charles Fuller's newplay to a ``Fancy Footwork'' performance by the Copasetics, a groupof the oldest tap dancers alive, during the festival which beginsJuly 30 and runs through Aug. 7.   Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to view the 107performances and exhibits in eight artistic disciplines, but MissTyson said she hoped the festival will have special impact onblacks in the audiences.   ``Art for us in the black community is at the bottom of theladder,'' she said.   ``For too long, we've just been trying to support our families,put bread on the table, roofs over our heads. Art just seems tohave been given a back seat. We are just learning to appreciate artand to understand it and to know it is just as important as food onthe table. It's food for our souls.''   The actress said she planned to see some of the paintings andsculptures on exhibit and take in a performance of ``Sally'' by theNegro Ensemble Company, the world's oldest professional blacktheater company. The play is the latest effort by Fuller, who won aPulitzer Prize for ``A Soldier's Play.''   Miss Tyson, whose work on the upcoming movie ``Dessa Rose'' willcut short her festival visit, said she also hoped to see ``Apollo,It Was Just Like Magic,'' a musical about the legendary Harlemtheater also premiering in Atlanta.   ``Apollo,'' starring Peabo Bryson and Patti Austin, is written,directed and choreographed by George Faison, who won a Tony Awardfor ``The Wiz.''   ``I want to see a little bit of everything, but I'm going tohave to put on my running shoes to get it all in,'' Miss Tyson said.   Davis, who will be host for a seven-hour evening of music andpoetry called ``Lyrics to Live By'' on the last day of thefestival, said he also wondered just how much he'll be able tosample. He'll miss the first few days while acting in Spike Lee'snew movie, ``Do the Right Thing.''   Davis said he feels a great deal of satisfaction from theincreasing amount of work being offered black artists.   ``One of the reasons we haven't had a black arts festival ofthis scope before is that we've not been able to get nationalattention from funding sources or the viewing audiences,'' he saidin an interview. ``It's only in the last 20 or 25 years thatAmericans have started to take seriously the contributions of blackartists.   ``We haven't had the opportunity, but now that we have theopportunity, we're going to shine.''   Black artists are getting the chance to strut their stuff inAtlanta because, five years ago, Michael Lomax, chairman of theFulton County Board of Commissioners and a former city of Atlantacultural affairs director, decided Atlanta needed a big festival.   ``My hope was that this would be, for want of a bettercomparison, a black Spoleto,'' he said, referring to the SpoletoFestival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C. ``But our festival is moreurban, less pristine, than Charleton _ but then, so is Atlanta.''   That Atlanta's festival would showcase black talent isappropriate for a city with a thriving black arts community, ablack political power structure and a two-thirds black population.   ``It is a cosmopolitan hub where the black community rubsshoulders with the best and most powerful of America and theworld,'' said Davis, a native of south Georgia. ``Atlanta is a mostappropriate venue. And, with the Democratic convention justleaving, it gives the city sort of a one-two punch.''   The $1.5 million festival will feature ticketed and free eventsin the disciplines of music, dance, film, theater, literary arts,folk art, visual art and performance art. The events at 35locations around metropolitan Atlanta range from big to small,mainstream to experimental.   Musical offerings will include an evening with pianist LeonBates and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, two days of the AtlantaJazz Festival, a gospel concert and a blues show on Auburn Avenue.   Dance performances will include work by members of the AlvinAiley American Dance Company, Bucket Dance Theatre, the DunhamChildren's Company and dancer-aerialist Joanna Haigood.   The Georgia Folklife festival at Georgia State Center for UrbanLife will feature performances of blues, jazz, Cajun music,fiddling and rhythm and blues, and exhibitions of quilting, basketweaving, netmaking, boatbuilding and other crafts and traditionalskills.   A series of films will be shown, including a presentation offour films by 1920s independent black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux anda docudrama on his life starring Danny Glover.   Among the exhibitions will be a show at the New Visions Galleryof Contemporary Art of a selection of 75 works by sculptor andprintmaker Elizabeth Catlett-Mora; her husband, painter FranciscoMora; and their son, painter and sculptor David Catlett-Mora.   Also, a juried exhibition open to black artists working inpainting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed-media, graphicsand video will be presented at the new gallery of the Collectionsof Life and Heritage.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, July 25</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
