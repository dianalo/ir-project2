The results are presented graphically and characterizedin detail. It is found that these binary systems can be brought out ofcontact, producing a period gap. It is inferred that DQ Her stars canevolve into AM Her stars, and that binaries with hydrogen-rich companionscan have periods shorter than the conventional limit of 72 h. 17 references.</TEXT></DOC>
