I was scared. I hadn't been able to get into mymind that the sirens were actually sounding in Tel Aviv, and not in a warmovie on a TV that had been left on.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LIFE IN TEL AVIV: JUMPING AT THUDS, CLINGINGTO MASKS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Shoshana Gabay is an Israeli journalist living in Tel Aviv. She wrote thisarticle for the Mercury News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     I was trying to concentrate on opening the package that had been filledvery efficiently by the Israeli civilian defense authorities, then on screwingthe filter into the mask.;    My next problem was to hide. I hadn't prepared asealed room, not wanting to participate in what had seemed to me to be aridiculous flurry of hysteria during which herds of Israelis were seen rushingin the streets armed with sealing tape, plastic wrappers, batteries and cansof beans.;    Only then was my attention caught by the sound of sealing tapebeing pulled back in my next door neighbor's apartment. I politely called herand asked if she would mind company.; (hbox);    In an apartment in a suburbof Tel Aviv, Shir, my 2-year-old niece, burst into screams when my sisterElana put her in an infant protective carrier, a plastic transparent tent withan awful smell. Shir pounded her feet on the plastic wall of the tent.;   Elana had put a bottle and snacks in the tent. Shir opened a snack bag and, inher usual way, tried to offer a potato chip to her mother. She cried againwhen she couldn't pass the chip through the plastic.;    Chan, her 8-year-oldsister, refused to wear her gas mask. She started shouting that she'd ratherdie than wear that awful mask.;    On the next street, where my brother Davidlives, his son Roei, 9, threw up in the mask.;    The next morning the radiosaid that masks into which people vomited were not damaged and should be driedwith a hair dryer and reused.;    One mile away, at my brother Ronnie's house,4-month-old Tamir was looking with big gloomy eyes at those people wearingdark masks and breathing heavily, who used to be his loving parents before thesirens went on.;    Near Ronnie's house is my sister Metukah's house. I wasthere Friday when the missiles hit again.;    Metukah is five months pregnant.It is a difficult pregnancy, and she has been told to stay in bed. Her facewas looking pale and yellow after two false alarms of missiles and one attack.She was holding her kids, Jonathan, 9, and Avishai, 13.;    She told me she isafraid she is not going to make it through this pregnancy. She had twomiscarriages last year, and wants this baby very much.;    When she saw theanxiety in our eyes, she tried to hold herself together.; (hbox);    Thetragic irony was to hear on Friday morning that five people choked to death intheir gas masks.;    The first victim was a little Arab girl, Ala Gabara, 3,from the village of Taibay in the center of Israel. She died because herparents tried to force her to wear the mask while she was crying hysterically.Presumably, her screaming drew all the air out of the mask.;    Three elderlywomen were found dead with gas masks on their faces Friday morning byneighbors. There is a plastic cover for the filter on the gas mask. Theydidn't remove the cover from the filter.;    Sunday evening on TV, Mary Tikva,an 8-year-old girl whose house was damaged by a missile, told a reporter thatall her dolls had been broken in the attack and that she couldn't find theparts of her Barbie. She was given immediately a Barbie doll by the TVstation. She said it was not like her lost doll.;    After Mary, we saw theface of Lt. Jeffrey Zaun, an American Navy pilot, a prisoner in the hands ofthe Iraqis. You could see that he had been beaten and intimidated.; (hbox);   When the Patriot defense systems were set up, many people went to look atthem. One mother Tuesday was dragging her hysterical kids there to show themthat maybe it will be better now.;    In Israel, some elderly women bake cakesfor Israeli soldiers on the border. Now they are baking cakes all day forAmerican soldiers manning the Patriot batteries.;    We are still all veryapprehensive here, sensitive to any loud sounds that make us jump and thinkthe sirens are going off, clinging to our gas masks as to a talisman.;    Ifeel hostility toward Saddam Hussein and fear which I never felt towardenemies of Israel before.;    Israeli men and women can stand up to theirenemy in the front line, but we cannot stand the helplessness of our kids andelderly men and women in the sealed rooms.;    We feel here as if we weretrapped playing Russian roulette, wondering if the next missile will fall onour heads.; (hbox);    (As Shoshana Gabay dictated this story Tuesday, anIraqi missile hit an apartment building. She called back two hours later.);   Two hours ago, we were attacked here in Tel Aviv for the third time. We sat ina sealed room having this feeling of horror, waiting to see who of ourrelatives and friends would be the next target of Saddam Hussein. The feelingis of a line of ants waiting to be squashed in the game of a vicious child.Each time he picks another ant.;    The sirens don't help. The sirens come,and then after 30 seconds we hear the missile. It looks as if they are wakingus so we won't be sleeping when we die. It is not necessary. We are notsleeping. It has been five days since we slept.;    Since it is not allowedfor reasons of security to broadcast where the missiles hit, everybody is interrible hysterics. We already made sure our relatives were not hurt, but whatabout other people we know?;    The radio is describing the wounded peoplearriving at the hospital: one man with blood coming from his ears and holdinga little baby, a young man with bare feet holding a little black puppy.;   I'm waiting for more information. What they show on TV now is a classic comedyfrom 1939 with Carole Lombard and Jimmy Stewart named &quot;Made for Each Other.&quot;Trying to shift to CNN, I get confused and try to use the telephone instead ofthe remote control. The voice of the emergency vehicles brings my tired brainback to reality.;    Three old women are dead in the bombed building, theythink from heart attacks. Three people are wounded severely, including the onebaby. In all, there are 73 casualties.;    Nobody is going to sleep tonight.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SHOSHANA GABAY  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tel Aviv, Israel  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,194  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 24, 199100024290,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
