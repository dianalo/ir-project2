In its annual menu of suggested ways to slash the federalbudget's perennial imbalances, the non-partisan CBO on Tuesdayadvanced scores of ideas that are frequently discussed and just asconsistently swatted down in the face of vocal criticism.   Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes wouldraise $4.1 billion for federal coffers next year. A 5 percentnational sales tax, which probably could not go into effect untilfiscal 1991, would collect $82 billion that year. Applying theMedicare payroll tax to individual wages above $48,000 would bringin another $3.1 billion, the CBO said.   Each of these would help meet deficit reduction goals for thenext few years. For fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, theGramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $100 billion, which theWhite House says will require $27 billion in savings.   But President Bush has pledged to not raise taxes, and evenmembers of Congress who say new taxes are necessary prefer to talkabout levies on items such as gasoline, alcohol and tobacco.   Other options described by CBO have attracted equally littleenthusiasm.   Eliminating next year's scheduled cost-of-living increase forrecipients of Social Security, federal railroad, civilian andmilitary retirement and veterans' compensation programs would save$10.6 billion next year and $69 billion over five years. But fewpoliticians are willing to tangle with Social Security recipientsand veterans, two vocal lobbies.   Other possibilities outlined by CBO include:   _Raising $200 million next year by limiting interest deductionsthat may be claimed by corporations that borrow to take over othercompanies.   _Limiting deductions on business meals and entertainment to 50percent of their value, rather than the current 80 percent, to raise$1.8 billion next year.   _Boosting federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel by 12 centsper gallon to raise $12 billion next year, or imposing a $5 perbarrel oil import fee to produce $7.7 billion.   _Doubling the 16 cents tax per pack of cigarettes to raise $2.9billion, and raising $4.7 billion by increasing federal taxes on a750 milliliter bottle of wine from 3 cents to 54 cents and on asix-pack of beer from 16 cents to 63 cents.   _Restraining the growth in spending for the Star Warsanti-missile research program to only 5 percent per year, saving$880 million next year.   _Having U.S. allies pay the salaries of their natives working onAmerican overseas military bases, and pay for utilities and othermaintenance costs on the bases, a $2.5 billion savings in 1990.   _Eliminating 15,000 military personnel in response to theintermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty between the United Statesand the Soviet Union, a $110 million savings.   _Increasing the Medicare deductible for doctors' services from$75 per year to $200 per year for a $1.5 billion savings.   _Raising the 1 percent fee the Veterans Administration charges toguarantee home loans to 1.75 percent, producing $290 million insavings.   _Saving $5.1 billion by lowering the target prices used todetermine farmers' deficiency payments by 5 percent.   _Canceling development of NASA's planned space station, a $390million savings next year.</TEXT></DOC>
