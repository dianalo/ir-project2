Higher temperatures and a little sun produce the golden flowersbut bring sharper, bitter leaves. Collect dandelion greens with their rootsonly from areas that have not been exposed to pesticides and harshfertilizers.;    Dandelions are one of the easiest domesticated garden cropsto grow. Although related to the wild variety, the domesticated dandelion is adifferent species, with broader leaves and a less pronounced flavor.;    Sowthe seeds in a shaded area for slower growth, pick the leaves often from thestems before flowering, and you should get three to five crops.;    In themarket, select bright green leaves -- avoid limp and yellowed ones. Dark greenleaves look great but are the most bitter, so steer away from these as well.Dandelion leaves store the best with the root attached, so use the looseleaves quickly while still crisp.;    Clean the leaves by removing them fromthe root and soaking them in cold water. Agitate the water to loosen the dirt,then remove the leaves to a colander to drain. Repeat if necessary, especiallyafter a recent rainfall. Spin to dry or lay the leaves out on heavy papertoweling.;    The smaller leaves are best for salads. They are enhanced whencloaked in dressings with the vibrant flavors of lemon, wine vinegars,mustards, bacon and olive and nut oils.;    The larger and bitter leaves arebest cooked. Blanch them in boiling salted water until tender, about threeminutes, which reduces the bitterness. Drain into a colander and cool undercold running water.;    For robust spring flavors, substitute dandelion forcooked spinach in your favorite recipe. To prepare as a vegetable, saute inolive oil or butter with seasonings of garlic and lemon. Dandelion also makesa great soup with shallots and chives.;    (hbox); DANDELION AND PANCETTASALAD;  3/4 cup virgin olive oil, divided;  1/4 pound pancetta, diced(substitute slab or regular bacon);  1/4 cup red wine vinegar; 2 tablespoonscoarse-grained mustard;  1/4 teaspoon salt;  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground blackpepper; 4 cups dandelion leaves, stems removed; 1 red pepper, roasted, peeled,seeded and diced;  1/2 cup snipped fresh chives; 2 tablespoons mustard seed;  In a medium-size skillet, combine 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and thepancetta.
