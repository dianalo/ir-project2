(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Danielle, Diane.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The NETGEN portion of Novell's NetWare 2.1 package causes a numberof difficult problems when it is installed in a system.andP;  Theinstallation of any network operating system is difficult butNetWare's NETGEN compounds the problem.andP;  The installation programthat came with NetWare version 2.0 was not as feature-laden, butwas certainly more efficient.andP;  The process of using NETGEN and theproblems resulting therefrom are discussed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Novell Inc. (products).andO;Ticker:    NOVL.andO;Product:   NetWare 2.1 (Computer network software) (design and construction).andO;Topic:     Network Management SoftwareSoftware DesignMenus.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Last week I looked at NetWare's 2.1x SHGEN program.andP;  This week, let's look atNETGEN, which creates the operating system.andM;As with SHGEN, you can do part of the process on a local hard disk, and itsinstall program also changes file dates.andM;It has one special quirk.andP;  When you exit NETGEN, a message pops up saying&quot;Downloading the needed files to floppy disk.&quot; Your probably empty A: drivewill light up.andP;  What does it want?andP;  Wait a minute.andP;  It will prompt you toinsert your SUPPORT diskette.andP;  Why doesn't it tell you to do that before itstarts to download?andM;The second stage, which must be done at your server, is a classic example ofhow not to design an operating-system installation.andM;Unless you have a spare server, lots of time, or experience, installing a LANoperating system is pretty nerve-racking.andP;  More than anything, you want toget it done easily and quickly.andP;  Not with NETGEN.andM;If your server lacks two diskette drives and you can't create a virtual disk,you must repeatedly swap several diskettes.andP;  Why?andP;  As far as I can tell,chiefly for the pleasure of seeing pop-up menus on the screen.andM;If you select the VDISK option, it doesn't work.andP;  (So what was NetWare doingwhen it was checking your environment?andP;  Doesn't it know you've got extendedmemory?andP;  This is, after all, NetWare 286.)andM;If you create your own VDISK, NETGEN will tell you it's too small or bad.andO;Ignore the message.andP;  It will work.andM;If you're not careful about your menu selections, you can easily end upcreating the operating system from scratch (which you may suspect hashappened after about 20 minutes of the disk dipsy-doodle).andM;Sometimes the Esc key takes you back a menu; sometimes it executes afunction.andP;  Sometimes the menu option highlighted is the right choice;sometimes it isn't.andM;The 2.0x installation wasn't fancy.andP;  You typed &quot;install,&quot; got a list of adozen or so items, picked what you wanted and answered the prompts.andP;  If youweren't certain what an option did, you looked in the manual.andM;It wasn't perfect.andP;  You often didn't know if an escape hatch existed, and thelinking of printer numbers to ports required a complex table, but it wasbasically simple and direct.andM;Contrast this to the 2.1x version, with its fancy menus, disappearing optionsand misleading prompts.andM;What happened?andP;  My guess is that some junior programmer just out of a collegecomputer science program decided the old 2.0 method was too dull.andP;  Heprobably spent weeks developing these &quot;friendly&quot; semi-intelligent menus.andP;  Buthe let the interface drive the functions, instead of the reverse.andM;He should be condemned to doing a dozen or so installs and upgrades.andM;What can you do?andP;  Wait for NetWare 386.andP;  It's done right.andM;----------Diane Danielle manages an extensive LAN for one of the country's largestbank-holding companies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
