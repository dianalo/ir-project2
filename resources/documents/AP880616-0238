The introduction Tuesday of the new mid-sized computers will be``one of the most important in IBM's history,'' Dataquest Inc., aSan Jose, Calif.-based market researcher, predicted Wednesday.   IBM is locked in a struggle with archrival Digital EquipmentCorp. for domination of the middle range of computing, and bothcompanies have been rushing products to market.   The new family of computers will succeed IBM's System 36 andSystem 38, which are the world's biggest-selling computers abovethe ranks of personal computers.   The existing machines are the workhorses for thousands of smalland medium-sized businesses. They also are used as departmentalcomputers in some big corporations, a niche where Digital has doneespecially well.   Although the rivalry constantly is see-sawing, ``We expect thisannouncement to radically alter the balance in the mid-range'' inIBM's favor, Dataquest analyst Allan Baumgartner said.   The new computers have been code-named Silverlake and Olympiaand will be unveiled as the AS-200 and AS-400 series, ranging inprice from $30,000 to more than $300,000, Dataquest says.   While the System 36 and System 38 are distinct machines that rundifferent software, the new computers all will run the samesoftware, although some older programs will have to be modified torun on them, analysts say.   There are already nearly 300,000 members of the System 36-38family installed worldwide, and over the next five years the newcomputers could raise the total to 700,000 systems with a value ofmore than $50 billion, Dataquest said.   IBM's share of worldwide mid-sized computer shipments byU.S.-based companies slid to 23.6 percent in 1987 from 27.2 percentin 1984, while Digital's rose over the same period to 18.9 percentfrom 15.2 percent, according to International Data Corp.   Each percentage point represents nearly $300 million in annualsales, so the battle for market share is intensely fought.   ``It will be probably the broadest announcement that IBM hasever attempted,'' in terms of the number of customers who will beaffected, said Robert Djurdjevic, an IBM watcher who is presidentof Annex Research Inc. in Phoenix, Ariz.   ``The big news is that IBM is going to make the mid-range marketexciting again, win or lose,'' said Donald Bellomy, an analyst forInternational Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.   ``If Silverlake doesn't take back some market share, then itwill be a failure,'' Bellomy said.   Digital and other computer companies are hoping to pick off someIBM customers during the transition by convincing them to switch totheir products instead of trading up to the new IBM computer.   ``If a customer's running out of capacity, they'd be doing theircorporation a disservice not to look at Vax,'' Digital's productline, Gary Hoppe, Digital's manager of U.S. sales consultants, saidin an interview.   The competitors' job will be easier if it is expensive anddifficult to move software from the old computers to the newones.IBM has promised that the new line will protect ``nearly all''of customers' investments in applications software, but it has notbeen more specific.   IBM should be able to hang onto customers as long as it has donea respectable job of providing continuity to the new products,Annex Research's Djurdjevic predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
