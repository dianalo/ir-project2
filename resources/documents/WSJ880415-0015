The settlement, which resolves all pension insurance claims against the steelmaker, eliminates a major obstacle to Wheeling-Pittsburgh's three-year-old bankruptcy-law reorganization. It could also influence LTV Corp.'s continuing reorganization.    The cash-strapped agency, which insures the pensions of 40 million workers, had fought Wheeling-Pittsburgh for nearly three years to recover the unfunded pension obligations it assumed after the steelmaker filed for bankruptcy-law protection in April 1985.    Under terms of the settlement, Wheeling-Pittsburgh agreed to pay the agency $60 million in cash and a $25 million note secured by a Treasury bond. The pact, the result of intense bargaining in recent weeks, still requires Bankruptcy Court approval.    Royal S. Dellinger, the agency's deputy executive director, said the pact sends &quot;a clear message that it's going to be very expensive for companies to back out of their pension promises.&quot; Mr. Dellinger, who negotiated the settlement, noted it will enable the pension agency to recover 17% of its losses, compared with an average of 10% over the agency's 13-year history.    Saddled with a $2 billion deficit, the quasi-federal agency has recently fended off claims on its insurance fund with increasing zeal. In addition to its dogged fight to recover losses from Wheeling-Pittsburgh, the agency is still locked in a bitter legal fight with Dallas-based LTV.    In light of that tough stance, some attorneys and creditors said the agency recovered far less under the settlement than they had anticipated. &quot;It sounds awfully low to me,&quot; said one attorney involved in both the LTV and Wheeling-Pittsburgh bankruptcy cases.    &quot;It indicates that for all the tough rhetoric, the PBGC is still willing to settle for pennies on the dollar,&quot; he added.    Robert Sable, an attorney for the steelmaker's unsecured creditors, said the settlement removes a major impediment to Wheeling-Pittsburgh's reorganization. Only claims by several iron ore companies overshadowed those of the pension agency.    &quot;From the creditors' and the company's point of view, it was always an issue of how much are we going to have to pay to get rid of the PBGC,&quot; Mr. Sable said.    &quot;This takes some of the steam out of the PBGC's argument that this is a matter of principle,&quot; he added. &quot;When it came time to settle, somebody just said let's take a lump-sum figure.&quot;    Although the settlement may hasten the steelmaker's emergence from Chapter 11, it leaves unresolved one central issue: whether Wheeling-Pittsburgh, after dumping its pension debt on the pension agency, can start fresh and offer workers a new pension plan with essentially the same benefits.    To the agency, that amounts to de facto continuation of the old pension plans, and an illegal subsidy under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the 1974 law that created the agency to safeguard the retirement benefits of employees at failing companies.    That issue is now the center of a federal court fight in New York. LTV moved last year to restore nearly all uninsured benefits lost by its steelworkers and retirees after it defaulted on its pension plans following a July 1986 bankruptcy-law filing.    The pension agency, which had briefly absorbed LTV's $2 billion pension shortfall, subsequently returned responsibility for the plans to the steelmaker. Its reasoning: if LTV can afford to fund new pension obligations, it can afford to fund the old ones, too.    Wheeling-Pittsburgh is now operating with a temporary pension plan that, unless extended, expires in August. Unless the pension agency approves a successor plan, the steelmaker may face a predicament similar to LTV's. </TEXT></DOC>
