The three closed yesterday were First National Bank of Navasota, Navasota, Texas, which had assets of $30.8 million; First State Bank, Blanchard, Okla., with assets of $23.2 million, and First National Bank of Luther, Luther, Okla., with assets of $17.8 million.    The Navasota bank, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as First Bank, a newly chartered subsidiary of American Capital Corp., Centerville, Texas. The failed bank, which held deposits of $28.2 million in 4,200 accounts, was the 35th Texas bank to fail this year.    The Blanchard bank, closed by the Oklahoma bank commissioner, is to reopen today as a branch of First State Bank, Hinton, Okla. The failed bank held $21.4 million in 4,500 deposit accounts, including $17,000 in 14 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Owners of uninsured deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    The Luther bank, closed by the comptroller's office, is to reopen today as a branch of First Wagoner Bank andamp; Trust Co., Wagoner, Okla. The failed bank held deposits of $17.6 million in 2,700 accounts.    A total of 21 Oklahoma banks have failed this year.    (Revised WSJ Aug. 17, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
