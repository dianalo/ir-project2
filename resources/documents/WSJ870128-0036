Mobil Corp.; Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group; and Sun Co. all reported that net income in the quarter was less than half the level of the year-earlier quarter. Chevron Corp., burdened by a $316 million charge related to oil wells that have become unprofitable, finished the quarter in the red.    A lone optimistic note was sounded by Shell's president, John F. Bookout, who said, &quot;Although we see no indications of a dramatic crude-oil price improvement, the worst may be behind us.&quot;    Mobil Corp.   In New York, Mobil said the 53% plunge in fourth-quarter earnings reflected heavy losses from exploration and production operations. Revenue slid 27% to $12 billion from $16.54 billion.    Although earnings from refining and marketing, chemicals and the Montgomery Ward retail businesses improved, these increases were offset by sharply lower crude-oil and natural-gas prices from exploration and production operations, a Mobil statement said.    The earnings included &quot;a $100 million provision for the accelerated amortization of exploration and producing assets,&quot; or leases in the U.S., &quot;and $47 million in lower LIFO inventory gains.&quot; Reduction of inventories carried under the last-in, first-out accounting method has a favorable effect on earnings because the sale of older, lower-cost inventory stocks reduces the company's cost of goods sold and produces an unusually high profit margin.    Mobil's annual revenue declined 19% to $49.37 billion from $60.6 billion.    Annual earnings include a $150 million loss on the sale of the Container Corp. subsidiary; during 1985 there was a $508 million charge for the restructuring of Montgomery Ward. Excluding these items, operating profit was almost unchanged at $1.55 billion, or $3.81 a share, compared with $1.54 billion, or $3.79 a share.    Of particular note was Montgomery Ward's bright performance, analysts say. The retail business, the purchase of which has been sharply criticized by shareholders and analysts, showed earnings more than doubled last year. Profit before financing and corporate expenses rose to $106 million from $42 million last year.    But &quot;Mobil's earnings this year (1987) are likely to be lower than last year&quot; because refining and marketing operations are expected to become less profitable through at least the first half of this year, as crude oil prices rise and product prices lag, said Sanford Margoshes, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;Extremely profitable refining and marketing operations kept oil companies afloat during 1986.&quot;    Mobil's capital spending last year declined by 14% to $3.03 billion from $3.51 billion.    Chevron Corp.   Chevron's fourth-quarter loss reflects a $316 million after-tax charge related to write-offs of wells that Chevron decided aren't profitable to develop at current crude-oil prices. It was the company's first quarterly loss since 1933.    San Francisco-based Chevron, the nation's third-largest oil company, had said in December that it planned to take the write-off, which it then estimated at $320 million.    Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 45% to $5.9 billion from $10.7 billion a year earlier. For the full year, revenue fell 39% to $27.6 billion from $45.3 billion.    George M. Keller, chairman, attributed the fourth-period loss also to a reduction in profit margins on refining and marketing operations. Higher margins earlier in the year had helped offset lower crude prices, he said.    Shell Oil Co.   Shell Oil, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Group, said fourth-quarter revenue dropped 18% to $4.51 billion from $5.51 billion a year earlier.    Shell said earnings in the quarter and the year were reduced by $70 million from a settlement with the Department of Energy of alleged violations of price controls on crude oil and petroleum products.    Profits from oil and gas exploration and production dropped 66% to $165 million from $481 million because of lower prices for crude oil, natural gas and gas liquids. Earnings from oil products fell 79%, to $35 million from $167 million, while earnings from chemicals more than quadrupled, to $141 million from $33 million.    For the year, net fell 46% while revenue declined 15%, to $17.35 billion from $20.48 billion.    While earnings from oil products and chemicals increased during the year, earnings from oil and gas exploration and production fell 70% to $427 million from $1.43 billion.    Shell cut its overall spending on capital investments and oil and gas exploration last year by 36% from 1985 levels. Capital and exploration spending fell to $2.84 billion from $4.45 billion.    Sun Co.   Radnor, Pa.-based Sun said that earnings in the quarter fell 83%.    Revenue fell 50% to $2.21 billion from $4.4 billion.    Earnings included a $40 million after-tax gain from the sale of the energy concern's industrial products distribution business. Earnings also included a $24 million charge related to a provision for employee terminations and a write-down of certain coal assets. Operating profit fell 60% to $54 million from $136 million.    Earnings for the year-ago quarter included a gain of $204 million from the sale of oil and gas producing properties and a $74 million gain from an initial public offering from the company's master limited partnership, formed late last year.    Robert McClements Jr., Sun's chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the poor performance primarily to difficulties in the domestic exploration and production business. Mr. McClements cited &quot;significant declines&quot; in crude oil and gas prices. The company earned $100 million in the quarter from U.S. exploration and production, compared with $419 million a year ago.    For the year, earnings fell 27%. In addition to the $40 million gain and the $24 million charge reported in the fourth quarter, 1986 earnings included an after-tax gain of $10 million relating to the disposition of Sun's motor freight business and a $24 million charge, primarily resulting from a work-force reduction in the company's exploration and production business.    1985earnings included the $204 million gain from the sale of oil and gas properties and the $74 million gain from the master limited partnership's initial public offering.    Revenue for the year fell 31% to $10.44 billion from $15.1 billion.    ---                         1986               1985                      in      per        in      per     %                   millions  share    millions  share   chg.
