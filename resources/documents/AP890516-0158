Gorbachev denied a prosecutor's charge of corruption andsaid the allegation was politically motivated, it was reportedTuesday.   The denial by Politburo member Yegor Ligachev, and hissubsequent charge of mudslinging by the crusading prosecutor,Nikolai Ivanov, was the latest development to stun Sovietsunaccustomed to hardball political campaigns.   The official Novosti news agency said Tuesday that Ligachev,considered a conservative and a potential foe of Gorbachev,``resolutely denied'' the accusation made Friday by Ivanov in theprosecutor's final days of an election campaign for the new Sovietparliament. Ivanov won a seat in the parliament on Sunday.   Politburo members have been caught in corruption scandals butususally they resign and disappear before a whiff of scandalemerges. It is unusual for a sitting, powerful Communist Partyleader such as Ligachev to be accused of wrongdoing, and even moreunusual for a denial to be published.   ``Yegor Ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations andcalled the attention of the commission to the fact that theslanderous statement was intended as a political provocation,''Novosti said in its report sent to The Associated Press by telex ina message titled ``Televised Disinformation.''   ``He insists that the case be thoroughly considered and theresults reported in the press,'' Novosti said, citing ``reliablesources'' for its report on one of the highest officials in theKremlin.   Ivanov helped prosecute a corruption case that led to theconviction of former Deputy Interior Minister Yuri Churbanov, theson-in-law of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev.   In his accusation made on Leningrad TV Friday night, Ivanov saidLigachev's name had come up in the investigation. He offered nodetails.   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, both are being investigatedfor alleged abuses of power by a commission of the Presidium, thenation's top executive body. Ligachev issued his complaint to thatcommission, Novosti said.   Ivanov and Gdlyan, who won a legislative seat in an earlierround of elections, became nationally known in a bizarre corruptioncase that involved an Uzbek collective farm chairman who kept a petlion and a private prison. The scandal spread to include thepresident and premier of Uzbekistan and Churbanov.   Ivanov said on TV that if he were elected, he would do his bestto see that Ligachev _ also a deputy to the new Congress _ is notchosen a member of the smaller Supreme Soviet that will hold muchof the legislative power.   The prosecutor won his seat in the new Congress of People'sDeputies with a resounding majority. He campaigned on the slogan,``No to the Mafia, Yes to Ivanov!'' He emphasized his record as aprosecutor and called for a national investigative commission touproot corruption.   Election opponents accused him of methods reminiscent ofdictator Josef Stalin, and said they feared he could set offanother round of deadly purges by playing on the public's need tofind scapegoats for the disastrous state of the Soviet economy.   The Presidium commission investigating Ivanov and Gdlyan wasformed to consider citizens' complaints that the men abused theirpower in investigating high-level corruption. Gorbachev chairs thePresidium.   Both men reportedly were removed from the corruptioninvestigation last week. A man who answered Gdlyan's officetelephone Tuesday night said Gdlyan was refusing comment on bothhis own investigation of corruption and the Presidium investigationof him.   The commission said Saturday in the Communist Party daily Pravdathat the two prosecutors made ``provocative statements'' about``violations of law'' by some political leaders, and accused themof trying to disorient people and interfere with the commission.   A separate investigation by the Supreme Court already hasdetermined that Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 inEstonia. The accused, an eminent scientist, died in jail. TheSupreme Court has asked the prosecutor's office to considerdismissing Gdlyan as a result.</TEXT></DOC>
