The Athens Seismological Institute said the tremor measured 5 onthe Richter scale. Its epicenter was in the Ionian seabed offCephalonia, about 195 miles from Athens.   ``We felt the tremor around lunchtime but people didn't botherto leave their homes and there were no damage reports,'' said apolice officer on Cephalonia, speaking on condition of anoymity.   Tremors measuring 5.8 and 5.3 on the Richter scale shook theisland on May 18 and May 21 but caused no damage.   Buildings on Cephalonia have been constructed to withstandtremors of 7 on the Richter scale ever since the Ionian islands offwestern Greece were hit by a devastating quake in 1953.   The Richter scale is a measure of the energy released by anearthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on aseismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increasein magnitude.   A quake measuring 5 on the Richter quake can cause considerabledamage and quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.</TEXT></DOC>
