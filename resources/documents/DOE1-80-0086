<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0086 </DOCNO><TEXT>The forward/backward hadron calorimeter of the Collider Detector at Fermilab(CDF) is composed of proportional tube chambers and steel plates. Itis designed to cover a pseudorapidity region of 2.2 {le} vertical strokeetaverticalstroke {le} 4.2. The readout of this calorimeter is accomplished throughsensing the induced charge pulses produced on the chamber's cathode inresponse to a hadronic cascade shower. We describe the main featuresof these chambers and present the results of performance tests on thefirst group of chambers produced.</TEXT></DOC>
