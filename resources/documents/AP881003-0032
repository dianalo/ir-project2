Dennis Eckart says he refused to dyehis hair, but in every other way the Ohio congressman has tried totransform himself into Dan Quayle as Democratic vice presidentialcandidate Lloyd Bentsen readies for Wednesday night's debate.   ``I played Abraham Lincoln in 4th grade, so I've played aRepublican before,'' quips Eckart, who is standing in for the GOPvice presidential nominee in mock debates with Bentsen.   Actually, Eckart, the former high school and college actor nowin his fourth term in the House, has played a variety of roles,including a Walter Mondale for Ohio Sen. John Glenn's campaign fouryears ago.   Like Quayle, Eckart is a young, handsome Midwesterner, althoughdark-haired and not blond like Quayle. At 38, Eckart is actuallythree years younger than the Indiana senator. But at this point, hefeels he knows him well.   ``He's a cheerleader. He's very enthusiastic about what hedoes,'' says the Democrat, who, in the spirit of the Indianasenator, wore a golf tee tucked over one ear and carried a putteron the campaign jet Sunday.   ``I've spent a lot of time on the practice tee at Congressional(Country Club)'' since getting called to play Quayle about threeweeks ago, he joked.   Eckart says he has studied Quayle's congressional record andhours of videotapes of his television performances, including the1980 debates against Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Ind., whom Quayle defeatedto enter the Senate.   ``Dan actually took him apart repeatedly,'' he said.   Eckart says the format for Wednesday's debate in Omaha, Neb. _with questions from reporters, two-minute answers and one-minutereplies _ favors Quayle. It will be ``a series of one-minute soundbites. ... And that's where Dan Quayle is absolutely at his best,''he said.   ``I think it's a grievous mistake'' to underestimate Quayle'sdebating ability, especially on television, he said.   ``I think Dan is the consummate media-age politician,'' he said.``I think Wednesday night is playing on Dan Quayle's home court.''   And this time, ``Dan has got the best handlers in the world,''he said, referring to Bush media adviser Roger Ailes, who isoverseeing Quayle's preparations.   Eckart presented Bentsen with an inscribed golf ball _ the wordsare a campaign secret _ when he mock debated Bentsen for the firsttime Sunday morning in a Washington, D.C., hotel room. He plansanother performance today in Austin, where Bentsen is cramming forthe debate.   Eckart is separated from Bentsen except when they debate. Hesays he doesn't know either Bentsen or Quayle very well, althoughhe has worked with both of them occasionally in Congress.   He refuses to disclose the contents of Sunday's session, but hesays his research unearthed some zingers Quayle might use. ``I sentthem (a couple of staffers) scurrying out of the room,'' he bragged.   Eckart says he enjoys ``getting into the head'' of people he'splaying. Asked what he found inside Quayle's head, he laughed andsaid, ``Room to maneuver.'' It was about the only negative thing hehad to say about Quayle's ability.   In playing the Indiana senator, Eckart says he tried toduplicate his mannerisms and his point of view. But it is difficultto predict what attitude Quayle will bring to the debate, since itwon't be what he calls the ``vintage Dan Quayle'' of waving hisarms to stir up the crowds.   ``That's a wild card,'' he says.</TEXT></DOC>
