The automatic evaporation of waterin liquid radwastes prior to incorporation into asphalt reduces the volumeto be transported and disposed. In turn, the numbers of drums requiringhandling is reduced 5 to 10 times thereby lessening the chances for radiationexposure. Also, the extruder-evaporator is self-shielded and containsonly about one gallon of the radwaste. Dose rates at the surface of theequipment and filled containers from commercially operating systems forthe past 10 years in Europe are given.</TEXT></DOC>
