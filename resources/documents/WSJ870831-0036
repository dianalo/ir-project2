They say interest rates could move irregularly higher amid growing investor concern about a weakening dollar, huge trade and budget deficits and inflationary pressures.    Despite no evidence that inflation is running out of control and little evidence that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit soon, &quot;There's too much fear that things are getting worse&quot; for bond investors, said John Werring, president of Newark, N.J.-based Prudential Fixed Income Advisors.    &quot;The biases are too strong toward higher interest rates to make me believe we'll see anything more than a few false bond rallies,&quot; said Mr. Werring, who's responsible for managing $8 billion of Prudential's more than $50 billion of fixed-income assets.    Since July 10, the yield on actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds has surged nearly three-quarters of a percentage point to 9.18%, its highest level in more than 18 months. Rates on three-month Treasury bills also spurted about three-quarters of a point to 6.29% in the past seven weeks amid growing expectations that the Fed may soon adopt a restrictive monetary policy.    The combination of a weakening dollar and huge budget and trade deficits has paralyzed many investors, said Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;But it's investor fear more than anything else&quot; that's driving rates higher, she said.    Many corporations also are fretting that the outlook for raising money will deteriorate. &quot;Clearly, we're in a higher interest rate environment,&quot; said Richard Clout, vice president in charge of borrowing at General Motors Acceptance Corp., Detroit, which has about $80 billion of debt outstanding.    &quot;For quite a while, we were in an 8 1/4%-9% band&quot; for 30-year government bond yields, Mr. Clout added. &quot;We're about to move into the next band that could take us past 10%&quot; during the next nine months.    Despite the dollar's more than 6% slide against the Japanese yen and nearly 5% decline against the West German mark the past two weeks, &quot;It's going to take a much sharper decline to provoke the Fed to tighten credit,&quot; said Ms. Hering. In the meantime, &quot;Expectations can drive rates higher&quot; without any encouragement from the central bank, she contended.    Several top investment strategists at Prudential, one of the nation's largest managers of debt securities, have different reasons for adopting a gloomy outlook on the credit markets.    &quot;I'm aggressively underweighted in U.S. bonds,&quot; said Kenneth A. Wineheim, a director responsible for more than $2 billion of assets at Prudential's international capital management subsidiary. &quot;The West German and Japanese bond markets look much more attractive because the dollar is likely to decline significantly without any significant reduction in either the U.S. trade or budget deficits.&quot;    Jeff Pantages, a vice president in charge of Prudential's $2 billion of taxable bond mutual funds, said the fear of higher inflation could keep rates &quot;artificially high&quot; despite the latest government reports showing both producer and consumer prices registering modest 0.2% increases in July. &quot;It's too early to throw in the towel on the low inflation scenario, but I'm riding the fence&quot; until there's more evidence of a trend, he said.    Whatever happens to inflation, &quot;The bond market represents value with yields up two percentage points from last year,&quot; said Leonard Santoro, vice president and director of Prudential's outside fixed income pension assets. Nevertheless, he expects bond yields to rise to double digits.    Some analysts contend the rampant pessimism in the credit markets recently is unwarranted. &quot;Fears of the dollar going into a black hole aren't justified,&quot; said James Capra, an investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;I understand all the inflation fears, but so far the numbers don't measure up. In fact, we could have 4% inflation during the second half, which would make bond yields over 9% look very attractive. I think we could see a rally very soon,&quot; he added.    Mr. Clout of GMAC agreed. &quot;I don't see 6% inflation in the months ahead, but more like 4 1/2% to 5%&quot; on an annualized basis, he said. Even so, &quot;after a short-term rally,&quot; Mr. Clout contended yields &quot;will probably rise a lot further before they fall sharply.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Prices of actively traded 30-year government bonds declined nearly half a point, or almost $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The losses were the eighth in the past nine sessions. Corporate and municipal issues also tumbled.    The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 96 30/32 from 97 3/8 Thursday, as the yield rose to 9.18% from 9.13%. Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 7.82 points to 1229.38. The index ranged between 1227.35 and 1239.15.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 97 18/32 from 97 25/32 as the yield rose to 9% from 8.97%.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on federal funds averaged 6.84%, down from 6.90% Thursday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). The fed funds rate averaged 7.24% Wednesday. Treasury bill rates rose. The rate on the Treasury's 13-week bills rose to 6.29% bid from 6.28% bid Thursday and 6.25% bid Wednesday. The rate on the Treasury's 26-week bills surged to 6.39% bid from 6.27% bid Thursday and 6.18% bid Wednesday. </TEXT></DOC>
