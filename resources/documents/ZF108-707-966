(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Kelley DamoreandM;When users think about database power, most think of a relationaldatabase-management system.andP;  However, flat-file databases are valuable toolsfor other reasons, according to buyers surveyed in this week's PC Week Pollof Corporate Satisfaction.andM;&quot;When a user doesn't need linked tables, there's no reason to go to ahigh-powered relational database.andP;  A flat-file database is an alternativethat's easy to use and less expensive,&quot; said a geochemist who requestedanonymity.andM;Five flat-file databases were included in the Poll.andP;  Reflex 2.0 from BorlandInternational Inc. of Scotts Valley, Calif., and Qandamp;A 3.0 from Symantec Corp.andO;in Cupertino, Calif., tied with the top overall score of 77 points; PC-File5.0, from Buttonware Inc., of Bellevue, Wash., trailed close behind with anoverall score of 74.andP;  Professional File 2.01, from Software Publishing Corp.,andO;of Mountain View, Calif., fell four points below PC-File with a score of 70.andO;Rounding out the list was RapidFile, from Ashton-Tate, in Torrance, Calif.,andO;which ranked lowest with a score of 67.andM;Among the 420 respondents surveyed, overall reliability, ease of use of theuser interface and overall performance topped the list of attributes theyfound most important in their buying decisions.andM;Reliability Is a MustandM;For the buyers surveyed, a flat-file database's overall reliability was themost relevant consideration.andM;&quot;Reliability is most important,&quot; said Dan Zeltner, owner of ZeltnerConsulting, a consulting firm.andP;  &quot;Minor problems with reliability can stop youfrom using a package altogether.&quot;andM;Jeff Chizever, engineer for Yankee Atomic Electric Co., anengineering-support firm, said: &quot;Reliability entails accuracy in the programand that it doesn't crash.andP;  If you can't get anything done, what's the use ofthe program?&quot;andM;Reliability is crucial in setting up databases of information on collegeapplicants at the University of California at Santa Barbara, according toresearch assistant Jerry Lewis.andP;  &quot;We're very concerned with reliability andmaking sure the information is there and in the correct form,&quot; he said.andM;Leading the pack in reliability was Reflex, which garnered a score of 83,with Qandamp;A and PC-File trailing close behind with a tied score of 82.andM;&quot;Buying Borland assumes reliability,&quot; claimed Alan Purkis, senior consultantfor John Hancock Insurance Co.andP;  Purkis is pleased with Reflex 2.0 and hasencountered no problems running it.andM;Susan Mooney, electronic data-processing auditor and system-supporttechnician at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., believes Qandamp;A'sfavorable score in overall reliability is justified.andP;  &quot;When using anydatabase application, you want the information that's going to be put in thedatabase to be correct.andP;  You don't want a corrupt database that you're goingto have to copy over,&quot; she said.andM;Just three points behind overall reliability in the product-attribute listingwas ease of a product's user interface, according to the buyers.andM;Users shouldn't have to spend valuable time learning how a product works,said Jon Speck, program manager for Control Data Corp., a computermanufacturer.andP;  &quot;Learning should be consistently intuitive.andP;  We don't havetime to train on the software.andP;  If it isn't usable out of the box, then wedon't use it,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The easier the software is to use, the easier my job becomes,&quot; said JimBrackman, senior computer specialist at the Oakland Naval Hospital.andP;  &quot;Thisfrees up my time to help people with more serious problems.&quot;andM;Brackman added that the ease of using the user interface directly affects thequerying capabilities: &quot;If a product is easy to use, it becomes easy toabstract information through the query system.&quot;andM;&quot;Ease of use is very important.andP;  These programs are used for small personaldatabases.andP;  The end user must understand the program without input from[managers],&quot; said George Kopp, a computer programming engineer for theMissouri Highway and Transportation Department.andM;Top honors in ease of use of the user interface went to Qandamp;A, with a score of82.andP;  &quot;Qandamp;A is the easiest to use,&quot; said Yankee Atomic Electric's Chizever.andO;&quot;It's easy to import and export files, and users can quickly locateinformation in the manual.&quot;andM;With a score of 79, Borland's Reflex fell only three points behind Symantec'sQandamp;A in this category, indicating that its buyers are pleased with itsease-of-use capabilities.andM;Paul Shiraishi, a systems engineer at Boeing Co.'s fabrication division,chose the Reflex for its interface.andP;  &quot;I use it in a Mac and PC environment.andO;I chose it because it was easy to use as opposed to large databases likeParadox.&quot;andM;&quot;If it isn't easy, then why have it?&quot; said Paul Heinitz, information-systemsmanager for Color Perfect Inc., a commercial photographic laboratory.andO;Heinitz, who has been using Reflex for five years, said he finds using theprogram an intuitive process.andM;Close Contenders in PerformanceandM;In overall performance, there was close scoring among the top threecontenders.andP;  Borland's Reflex led the trio with a score of 81.andP;  Falling twopoints behind was Symantec's Qandamp;A.andP;  Nipping at Qandamp;A's heels was Buttonware'sPC-File with a score of 78.andP;  The other two opponents, Professional File andRapidFile, fell behind the ranks with scores of 74 and 71, respectively.andM;&quot;Performance is a combination of speed, the time it takes to import andexport large amounts of data, and reporting times.andP;  Overall, Qandamp;A'sperformance is excellent,&quot; said Bill Wilson, assistant vice president ofJohnson and Higgins, a corporate insurance brokerage.andM;&quot;Users have to be able to work with the package.andP;  In performance, speed andflexibility are crucial.andP;  A program has to adapt to the user's needs and doit fast,&quot; said Gary Crane, PC administrator for Sorrento Cheese Corp. &quot;Ittakes a while to get used to the Reflex interface, but once you get used toit, it performs fine.&quot;andM;&quot;Performance is a gray area.andP;  Basically, performance is defined as performingthe tasks that I need it to perform,&quot; remarked Barry Harmon, LANadministrator for the Controller of the Currency, part of the U.S.andP;  TreasuryDepartment.andM;PC-File deserves its lower scores, according to Harmon, because it &quot;performsabout 90 percent -- it always falls a little bit short.&quot;andM;Query power is an integral feature of flat-file databases, according tobuyers.andP;  Three different aspects of querying -- the power of queryingcapabilities, the flexibility of these capabilities and the flexibility ofreporting features -- received a collective score of 83.andM;In flexibility of querying capabilities, Reflex and Qandamp;A tied for the topposition with a score of 78.andP;  PC-File placed third, six points lower than thehighest scorers.andP;  RapidFile edged ahead of Professional File by one pointwith a score of 68.andP;  This was the only area in which RapidFile placed higherthan any of its rivals.andM;&quot;Flexibility of querying is important because a lot of times you havedifferent data that many people want to see in different ways.andP;  The programneeds to have the flexibility to suit everyone's needs,&quot; said Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette's Mooney.andP;  Mooney was particularly pleased with Qandamp;A'sEnglish-language query facility.andM;In the scoring, once again Reflex was head of the class in the area of powerof its querying capabilities.andP;  Qandamp;A fell behind Reflex by two points, and theremaining challengers lagged behind by at least seven points.andM;&quot;I like Reflex's ability to put together a file and database quickly withouthaving to do a lot of planning.andP;  After you put the file together, then youcan modify, sort, file or cross-tabulate,&quot; said Control Data's Speck.andP;  &quot;Aquery is more that just a filter -- it's the ability to work mathematicsflexibly.andP;  Reflex does that.&quot;andM;At John Hancock Insurance, many of the executives have chosen Reflex as theirdatabase because it combines ease of use with power, Purkis noted.andM;&quot;It gives you a lot of functions that aren't common to a flat-file database,&quot;he said.andP;  Purkis had used Professional File but found its functions limited,&quot;so I steered away from it,&quot; he said.andM;Yankee Atomic Electric's Chizever switched from Professional File to thesecond-placed Qandamp;A.andP;  &quot;Qandamp;A is the easiest to use.andP;  It's more powerful thanProfessional File.andP;  It does more -- for example, sorting, querying, gettingreports and setting up queries,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Professional File doesn't do wellin querying, or if it does, it takes too long to figure out.&quot;andM;Reflex led the pack in flexibility of reporting features with an overallscore of 76, followed by Qandamp;A with a score of 72.andP;  The three remainingopponents were clustered together in scoring.andP;  PC-File had a score of 69,Professional File received a 67, and RapidFile trailed behind with a score of66.andM;&quot;Reporting is a key feature,&quot; said Dale Lingo of Lingo Enterprises, acomputer dealership.andP;  &quot;It is important that the information a user entersinto the database can be extracted in the form that is desired.&quot;andM;Once again, Qandamp;A and Reflex were neck-and-neck for first place in thecategories of clarity of documentation and completeness and organization ofdocumentation.andP;  Qandamp;A, however, squeezed past Reflex with a three-point lead,boasting an overall score of 76 in clarity of documentation.andP;  In completenessand organization of documentation, Qandamp;A again was the leader of the pack bytwo points.andM;Qandamp;A's documentation received kudos from Johnson and Higgins' Wilson.andM;&quot;The documentation is excellent,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;In fact, it's the best I've seenfor databases, and the index is excellent.andP;  What I particularly like is thatevery help screen on the system has a corresponding page number to refer tothe manual for more information.&quot;andM;Speck, of Control Data, looked closely at quality of documentation.andP;  &quot;What'simportant in documentation isn't a large amount of verbiage but an excellentindex.andP;  I don't want a tutorial but a manual that I can jump around in.andP;  WithReflex I've never had an occasion where the manual couldn't answer myquestions,&quot; he said.andM;Buttonware's PC-File leaped ahead to receive top honors in value relative tocost, a full six points ahead of its nearest competitor.andP;  Reflex placedsecond with a score of 82, and Qandamp;A fell behind Reflex by three points.andO;Professional File placed fourth with a score of 74.andP;  RapidFile again placedlast, a whopping 25 points behind the leading score.andM;&quot;Buttonware is easy to use and its interface is good, but it does have somenegatives.andP;  It gets very complicated to program reports that aren't off ofthe menus.andP;  But the price is great -- it's cheap enough that you can have itin addition to dBASE,&quot; said Kopp of the Missouri Highway and TransportationDepartment.andM;Added Dale Lingo, owner of Lingo Enterprises, a computer dealership: &quot;You canget it as shareware.andP;  It has similar capabilities to other flat-filedatabases, and it's still less expensive than the rest.&quot;andM;RapidFile Falls DownandM;Ashton-Tate's RapidFile placed last in nine of the 11 categories.andP;  Overall,it placed 10 points behind the two leaders, Reflex and Qandamp;A.andP;  In fact, inevery category it was at least 10 points behind the respective leader.andM;&quot;RapidFile is very limited.andP;  The external lookup and reporting features arevery rough,&quot; said Marianne Wappett-Phiccione, an information consultant forCSX Technology Inc., a railroad and trucking company.andM;&quot;RapidFile doesn't give the user any flexibility,&quot; she added.andP;  &quot;It's not thateasy to use, and the documentation isn't detailed enough.&quot;andM;Peter Clark, owner of Swift Software, a software development company, wasn'tpleased with RapidFile, either.andP;  &quot;Relative to its retail price, I wouldn'trecommend it.&quot;andM;&quot;In my mind, it was as expensive as a major database package, but it has farfewer features than the bigger packages,&quot; said Dan Zeltner of ZeltnerConsulting.andP;  &quot;It's a flat-file manager and it wasn't as powerful in relationto the cost.andP;  Because the scope is a lot less, the price should be a lotless.&quot;andM;The least essential quality in choosing a flat-file database was productsupport accessibility, according to the respondents to this week's Poll.andM;&quot;I've generally found that when you call the support lines, they tell youwhat you've already done,&quot; remarked Mooney, of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.andM;The accessibility of product support is more important when the product ishardware, according to John Hancock Insurance's Purkis, since most usershesitate to perform their own repairs.andM;For database software, however, many users will try to solve any problemsthemselves, he said.andM;According to the University of California's Lewis, most user questions can behandled by an organization's in-house support staff.andP;  &quot;If there's a complexproblem, you can usually work around it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I guess you just expectproblems with databases.&quot;andM;-- Reliability, the ease of use of the user interface and overall performanceare rated most crucial to buyers of flat-file databases.andM;-- Among the remaining product characteristics, buyers indicate a nearlyequal interest in all areas except for product-support accessibility.andM;-- Borland's Reflex 2.0 and Symantec's Qandamp;A 3.0 tied for highest overallscore, receiving high scores in four and five areas, respectively, from theirbuyers.andM;-- The Borland and Symantec products tied for high score -- six points abovethe nearest competition -- in flexibility of querying capabilities.andM;-- Buyers of Buttonware's PC-File 5.0 gave it the highest score for valuerelative to cost, six points above its nearest competitor; buyers ofRapidFile 1.2 gave it the lowest score in this area, 11 points below the nextlowest score.andM;-- RapidFile buyers gave it the lowest scores in all areas except for powerof querying capabilities and flexibility of querying capabilities.andM;(High scores for each attribute circled in red)andM;PC WEEK POLL: FLAT-FILE DATABASESandM;Overall Weighted ScoreandM;Mean/Median Installed BaseandM;Overall ReliabilityandM;&quot;Ease of Use of User InterfaceandM;&quot;Overall PerformanceandM;&quot;Power of Querying CapabilitiesandM;&quot;FlexibilityandM;of Querying CapabilitiesandM;&quot;FlexibilityandM;of Reporting FeaturesandM;&quot;Clarity of Documen-andM;tationandM;&quot;Complete.andP;

 Theyallow for the creation of databases, ad-hoc querying and data browsing, andthe building and formatting of reports without the use of a programminglanguage.andM;Given these requirements, the packages covered in this survey include marketleaders and other brands selected as noteworthy by PC Week's editorial staff.andM;The above data was tabulated from the responses of 420 corporate orinstitutional buyers having one or more of the required packages installedfor at least three months.andP;  PC Week readers polled for this survey were drawnfrom those self-identified as being involved with computer purchasing andsupport, with responsibility for specifying, recommending, buying orapproving the purchase of database-management software.andP;  Survey data for eachof the above packages is based on responses from a minimum of 61 buyersowning a collective total of at least 667 installed units of that package.andM;Mean and median installed-unit averages are given to provide readers with therelative sizes of the installed bases of each package.andP;  The mean installedbase is the total number of units installed at all sites, divided by thenumber of sites.andP;  The median installed base is computed by arranging theinstalled-base sizes for all sites in numerical order, and selecting theinstalled base of that site above and below which half of these values fell.andM;The characteristics on which these software packages were surveyed includeease of use of the user interface; power of querying capabilities;flexibility of querying capabilities; completeness and organization ofdocumentation; clarity of documentation; flexibility of reporting features;accessibility of product support; quality of product support; value relativeto cost; overall reliability; and overall performance.andM;To produce the overall scores for these packages, PC Week first calculated anaverage score for each package for each of these characteristics.andP;  To reflectthe relative importance of each characteristic, as assigned by respondents,in comparison with all other characteristics surveyed, we calculated aweighting factor, which was then used to determine individual weighted scoresfor each characteristic of every package.andP;  A package's overall score is equalto the arithmetic average of these weighted scores.andM;Results published in PC Week Polls of Corporate Satisfaction reflect theopinions of buyers responding to Poll surveys, and may not necessarily beattributable to larger populations of buyers.andM;Packages Withdrawn from Poll ResultsandM;Survey data on three additional products originally intended for inclusion inthis week's PC Week Poll of Corporate Satisfaction results has been withdrawnfrom publication because those products failed to elicit responses from thePoll's required minimum of 25 buyers.andM;The vendors of Filing Assistant 2.0 (IBM) and Advanced DB Master 3.3 (MaconSystems Inc.) declined to provide PC Week with a mailing list of at least 150corporate customers, together with a signed agreement not to contact thosecustomers regarding this survey.andP;  Our mailing failed to elicit responses fromthe required 25 buyers.andM;Despite the fact that its vendor did provide PC Week with a mailing list,Omnifile 2.0 (SSR Corp.) was withdrawn from the Poll of CorporateSatisfaction because the minimum 25 buyers did not respond.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
