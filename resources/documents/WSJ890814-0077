Turnover in July was up 31.6%, however, compared with 47.6 billion francs in the same month a year ago, the department said.    Stock market analysts said the increase in July's turnover compared with June's was notable because July and August are usually the slowest months of the year on the stock exchange. They attributed the increase to the market's bullish trend, which began in early June, but picked up steam in July, as foreign investors began to show renewed confidence in Swiss equities.    For the first seven months of the year, turnover totaled 383.43 billion francs, an increase of 14.2% from a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
