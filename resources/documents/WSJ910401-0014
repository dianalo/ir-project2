But a month after the end offighting, there are signs that the chill is returning,officials say.   That development underscores how tricky it will be for Mr.Bush to capitalize on the wider Middle East peacepossibilities opened by the victory over Iraq. The problemswith Israel also illustrate how important it is for theadministration to persuade Israel and the Arab states to makesome small &quot;confidence-building&quot; gestures toward one anotherto improve what remains a tense atmosphere.</LP><TEXT>   Unhappiness is spreading within the Bush administrationover steps by the Shamir government that U.S. officials sayalmost seem designed to demonstrate Israel's unwillingness tocompromise on the Palestinian issue.   Even more galling from the administration's point of view,those actions began unfolding as soon as Secretary of StateJames Baker finished a post-war visit to Israel. That makesit seem that Israel is deliberately flouting theadministration position that a postwar Middle Eastarrangement requires the trading of Israeli-occupiedPalestinian lands for peace.   In particular, the U.S. was irritated that after Mr.Baker's visit, Ariel Sharon, the Israeli housing minister,toured occupied territories and encouraged settlements there,a senior State Department official said. Administration aidesnote unhappily that Prime Minister Shamir hasn't rebuked Mr.Sharon, even though he promptly slapped down anothergovernment minister who suggested that the issue of returningthe Golan Heights could be discussed with Syria.   The State Department also denounced Israel's plans,announced little more than a week after Mr. Baker returnedfrom his Mideast trip, to deport four Palestinians from theGaza Strip. U.S. officials had urged Israel to end thedeportations as one of the confidence-building measures itwants from Israelis and Arabs.   But above all, administration officials were upset whenthe Israeli government rejected talks with a group ofPalestinian leaders from Israeli-occupied territory that Mr.Baker had met on his trip. Israel said it considered themunacceptable negotiating partners.   The net result, one senior Bush aide says, is that whileMr. Bush ended the war with a stronger bond with Mr. Shamir,&quot;you can also feel that dissipate&quot; now as unhappiness mountsover Israel's actions.   Mr. Shamir is one of the few world leaders with whom Mr.Bush has had a hard time developing a friendly personalrelationship. The Israeli leader is uncomfortable with Mr.Bush's informal telephone diplomacy, Israeli officialsacknowledge. He tends toward a more formal style, and U.S.officials consider him prickly.   But the Bush-Shamir relationship warmed during the waragainst Iraq, White House aides say. When Israel was hit byIraqi Scud missiles, Mr. Bush had to urge him to stay out ofthe war and to undertake the politically difficult task ofstifling Israel's urge to retaliate. Mr. Shamir complied, andofficials say Mr. Bush developed an appreciation for theprime minister's toughness.   The fact that strains are reappearing reflects in part thedifference in the U.S. and Israeli perspectives on how thewar's outcome affected Israel. Americans focus on the factthat Israel's most dangerous military threat was demolished.Israelis focus on the fact that Palestinians in the occupiedterritories openly cheered Iraqi attacks on Israel, and thatPalestinians continued to regularly stab Israelis during themonths of the crisis.   For now, the administration's best hope may be to persuadeArabs to take confidence-building steps of their own toconvince the skeptical Israelis that the postwar Middle Eastcan in fact be a safer place for the Jewish state. The mostimportant such step would be an end, or at least moderation,of the Arab boycott of companies that do business withIsrael.   Mr. Baker has urged Arabs to at least take a step in thatdirection. Some Arab leaders indicate they are prepared to bemore lax in enforcing the boycott -- but a broader move toend boycott practices would send a far more powerful signalto Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
