In response to one widespread market rumor, the Federal ReserveBoard late Friday denied through a spokesman that it planned a newsconference to discuss serious problems at an unnamed, majorcommercial bank, whose creditworthiness allegedly had been batteredby the recent plunge in value of its junk bond holdings.   Meanwhile, traders remained anxious for word on whether Campeauwas able to pull off a financial restructuring that would prop upits own troubled high-yield junk bonds, which are the crux of themarket's current difficulties.   One of Campeau's ailing businesses, Allied Stores Corp., wasscheduled to make a major loan payment Friday to prevent default onits bonds, and Campeau was engaged in feverish negotiations withinvestors to draw capital needed to pull off the rescue.   Late Friday, Campeau said it had reached conditional agreementwith one of its major stockholders, Olympia andamp; York DevelopmentsLtd., on a $250 million loan to help meet the payment.   Disclosure on Wednesday that Campeau might not be able to makethe payment sent the junk bond market into a tailspin, as panickyinvestors dumped issues they deemed especially risky.   Traders said there was very little dealing in Allied junk bondsas well as the high-yield, high-risk bonds of Campeau's other retailunit, Federated Department Stores Inc., which also is in financialstraits.   Gauging activity in the overall junk market can be difficult,because most trading takes place over-the-counter _ that is, betweendealers who negotiate the price to be paid for a given bond _instead of in bidding on an open exchange. Very few junk bonds arelisted on the American and New York Stock exchanges and tallies onoverall market volume are not available daily.   Though quoted prices on a number of junk issues moved sharplylower in recent sessions, traders noted there was little actualbuying and selling.   Among distressed issues, Federated bonds have lost $200 per$1,000 in face value in recent days while yields jumped to 28percent, although traders said few of the bonds changed hands.   But rumors that Campeau would meet the debt payment spikedFederated bonds up $30 per $1,000 in face value around midday andthey held at those levels in later trading. Traders agree thatmaking the payment will help prop up Federated bonds, but they wereless optimistic that it would immediately cure the ills of the restof the market.   ``In terms of lending credibility to the junk market as a whole,it's not going to take just one day,'' said one trader.   Even quality issues continued to be depressed on Friday, eventhough there was no indication their creditworthiness had changed.Some RJR Nabisco bonds lost $15 per $1,000 in face value, while Stop'N Shop bonds, touched by trouble in the retail sector, also slippedas much as $30 per $1,000.   ``The trend in the market is separation between quality junk andjunky junk,'' one trader said. ``If people are going to startreinvesting, they're going to feel a whole lot happier owningquality.''   One economist who spoke on condition of anonymity characterizedjunk bonds as a daring investment fit only ``for a submarinecommander.''   But others countered that junk bond investors typically are thickskinned. ``People in the market are somewhat accustomed to `event'situations like this,'' said one trader referring to Campeau'sdomino effect on the market. She was confident emotions would settledown and investors would sit tight.   Critics have long complained about junk bond-financed leveragedbuyouts and restructurings, arguing that the big, high-interest ratedebt loads endangers a company's ability to repay. Whilesophisticated investors will remain loyal to their pet junk issues,one trader conceded that ``anyone who hated an LBO to begin with isgoing to say `I told you so.'''</TEXT></DOC>
