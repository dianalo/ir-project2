SullivanandM;Tape-backup vendors will demonstrate new software that supports Novell Inc.'score technology for backing up NetWare LANs at NetWorld next week, despitesome grumbling among developers over the engine's architecture.andM;Earlier this year, Novell shipped to developers the Storage ManagementServices (SMS) 1.0 Software Development Kit to provide a common structure forNetWare tape-backup software.andP;  Packages that follow SMS will automatically becompatible with future versions of NetWare, said Novell officials in Provo,Utah.andP;  To demonstrate the benefits of SMS, Novell will host a panel of fivetape-backup software developers at the NetWorld trade show in Dallas, vendorssaid.andP;  Mountain Network Solutions Inc., Sytron Corp., Maynard ElectronicsInc., Cheyenne Software Inc. and Palindrome Corp. will help clarify theadvantages of SMS, officials from these firms said.andP;  One of the first firmsto demonstrate an SMS product will be Maynard.andP;  The Lake Mary, Fla., firmwill announce and show at NetWorld MaynStream NLM, an SMS-compliant fileserver-based program that will be shipped next spring, said company presidentGeorge Rea.andM;Sytron officials will talk about the firm's plans to ship next March an SMSversion of Sytos Plus, said company officials in Westboro, Mass.andP;  Thesoftware will feature a Windows front end to NetWare backup sessions.andM;While SMS provides a common platform for supporting future NetWare versions,it will require developers to maintain a new code structure instead ofbuilding on their existing code, vendors said.andP;  &quot;People are going to have tomodify the architecture of their products to work with SMS,&quot; said onedeveloper who requested anonymity.andM;Others said SMS lacks support for data-handling and data-management featuresthat are essential in a good tape-backup package.andP;  Support for directoryservices and additional operating systems is also missing from the initialrelease, requiring vendors to add their own code to use these features.andO;Developers also said bugs are prevalent in the DOS target service agentprovided by Novell to support that operating system.andP;  &quot;Since we are workingon both NLM and DOS workstation versions of our software, this sets backdevelopment for SMS on the workstation side,&quot; said one vendor.andP;  Despite themissing elements of SMS, analysts said Novell's effort would enhance backupoperations.andP;  &quot;We finally have an operating-system company that is putting thehooks into the operating system that will move it toward a fullsystems-managed environment,&quot; said Mike Peterson, president of PeripheralStrategies Inc., a market-research firm in Santa Barbara, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
