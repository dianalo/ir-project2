The Communist Party daily Nhan Dan said the United States ``mustbear full responsibility for the obstacles it has set up in theprocess of settling the issue of Americans missing in action in theVietnam War and other humanitarian questions.''   The United States lists more than 1,700 American servicemen asmissing in action, or MIA, in Vietnam.   Last week, Vietnam said it halted cooperation on the MIA issueand on the resettlement in America of former prisoners ofre-education camps. Most of those prisoners were sent to the campsafter communist forces defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnamesegovernment in April 1975.   Vietnam earlier expressed anger at the U.S. State Department'scriticism of a congressional resolution calling for establishmentof ``interest sections,'' low-level diplomatic missions, inWashington and the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.   The State Department urged continuing the policy of isolatingVietnam until it withdraws its estimated 100,000 military personnelfrom Cambodia. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, oustedthe radical Khmer Rouge regime that had ruled since the spring of1975 and installed another communist government. When Vietnamsuspended cooperation on the issue of MIAs and former Vietnamesepolitical prisoners, Washington claimed the Vietnamese had broken apromise not to link the question of diplomatic ties withhumanitarian matters.   The Nhan Dan article, carried by the Vietnam News Agencymonitored in Bangkok, said it was Vietnam's consistent policy notto link humanitarian with political issues.   It said, ``The U.S. side has also agreed to do this, but in factit has violated this agreement.''   ``Time and again the U.S. administration has linked the MIAquestion with the normalization of of U.S.-Vietnamese relations,''Nhan Dan said. ``In his statement in Hawaii on July 21, U.S.Secretary of State (George) Shultz connected the normalization ofthe two countries' relations with an acceptable Kampuchea(Cambodia) and the settlement of the MIA issue.''   It said the United States rejected Vietnam's proposal forresettlement of the former re-education camp inmates and``responsible officials in Washington have voiced hostility towardsVietnam.''</TEXT></DOC>
