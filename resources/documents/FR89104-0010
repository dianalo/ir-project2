The rule also eliminates the portions of 24 CFR 203.49(e) and234.79(e) that discuss carryovers in ARM programs. The purpose of the changein the notice period is to conform HUD's practice to existing industrypractice. The purpose of eliminating the discussion of carryovers is toeliminate confusion in HUD's rules caused by reference to a feature inthe ARM program that has never been adopted in practice since the programwas implemented in 1984.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>Under section 7(o)(3) of the Department of Housingand Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(o)(3)), this final rule cannotbecome effective until after the first period of 30 calendar days of continuoussession of Congress which occurs after the date of the rule's publication.HUD will publish a notice of the effective date of this rule followingexpiration of the 30-session-day waiting period.

HUD's disclosure changewill conform with the existing practice in national banks, as authorizedby the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as with a pending requirementof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.The Department has determined that both changes covered by this rule shouldbe adopted without the delay occasioned by requiring prior notice and comment.When the interim rule (49 FR 23580) now comprising andSection;andSection; 203.49and 234.79 was published on June 6, 1984, HUD received 12 comments, severalof which focused on the potential for confusion over carryovers. At thetime, the Department decided not to revise the rule in that regard unless,after monitoring the program, it found that the question of carryoverswas in fact raising problems for lenders or borrowers. It now seems unlikelythat HUD/FHA ARM programs will involve carryovers and offsets in the foreseeablefuture. Moreover, there have been occasional inquiries from lenders (andfrom borrowers during periods of declining interest rates) about the useof carryovers in FHA ARMs. The Department has therefore decided to removethe reference to carryovers from andSection;andSection; 203.49 and 234.79.This decision does not call for further public comment since the issuehas been addressed previously in interim rule, and since removal of thereference at this time simply mirrors HUD's policy over the four-year lifeof the program.With respect to the change from 30 to 25 days' notice for annual adjustments,HUD observes that the Federal Reserve Board considered imposing a 30-daynotice requirement in its November 24, 1986 proposal to amend RegulationZ (51 FR 422451). However, as the preamble to the Board's final rule explained:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * [s]everal commenters addressed the proposed requirement foradvance notice of interest rate and payment adjustments. The primary criticismwas that the advance notice was required at least 30 days before the effectivedate of an interest rate adjustment and not before a payment at the newlevel is due, as is currently required by the OCC. The commenters statedthat this proposed requirement would cause problems for lenders offeringshort-term ARMs that closely track changes in the index values. Some commentersrecommended reducing the number of days before an adjustment that noticeis required and clarifying that notice should be given before a paymentat a new level is due. 51 FR at 48666.</ITAG>Accordingly, the Board adopted a 25-day requirement. The class of personsaffected by HUD's timing change in the present rule is included in theclass affected by the Board's decision, and the response of interestedpersons in the Regulation Z Docket is a matter of public record. It appearsthat no benefit would inure from an invitation by HUD for further comment.Moreover, the matter should be resolved quickly; HUD's change is intendedto coordinate with action by the Board and other Federal agencies in simplifyingand unifying both annual and pre-application disclosure requirements forARMs. Compliance with the Regulation Z changes were required as of October1, 1988, and optional before that date.This final rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. An analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at Room10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20410.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Undersignedhereby certifies that this rule will not have significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, because the change in the noticeperiod is not considered to be a serious burden upon any borrower, andbecause the carryover provisions affected by the rule have never been,in fact, implemented.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>has determined that the policies contained in thisrule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject toreview under the Order. The rule pertains only to the regulation of lendersinsured by the Federal Housing Administration, and presents no discerniblelikelihood of any conflict with State or local law.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family, </T3>has determined that this rule does not have a potentiallysignificant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule has onlyincidental effect on the procedural details of operation of a HUD insuranceprogram, and no significant relationship to family-related issues is evident.This rule was listed as item 984 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41974, 41995) underExecutive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Relocation Act of 1980 (Pub.
