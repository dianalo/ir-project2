The announcement led to a significant slide in Statewidestock, and spurred significant withdrawals at First NationalBank of Toms River by depositors yesterday. In nationalover-the-counter trading, its shares closed at 37.5 cents,down $1. Although the company said it didn't know exactly howmuch depositors had withdrawn from accounts, a spokesman saidthe &quot;morning traffic was heavy,&quot; but &quot;settled down a bit inthe afternoon.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Statewide said the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency has just completed an examination of First National,and that the bank was given one week to submit a plan toraise its capital level to 3% of assets, which currentlystand at $1.4 billion. But it said the regulators could movein before First National can meet the capital requirements.   If First National were to be seized, it would be thelargest bank failure in New Jersey in several years, saidReid Nagle, president of SNL Securities, a Hoboken, N.J.,banking research firm.   For 1990, the bank had a loss of $165.8 million, or $18.09a share compared with net income of $9.3 million, or 86 centsa share. For the first quarter, losses were narrowed to $1.7million, or 21 cents a share, from $9.7 million, or $1.08 ashare, a year earlier. The year-end results weren't formallyannounced until now because of the examination by federalregulators. The results of that examination are expectedsoon.   The addition to loan-loss reserves was made following theexamination by the Comptroller's office, which supervisesfederally chartered banks. Statewide, the 14th largest bankcompany in New Jersey, has been suffering from bad loans in aslumping real estate market in the state.   As a result of the provisions for loan losses,consolidated equity capital was reduced to a deficit of $11.8million for Statewide and $30.1 million for First National,the bank said. About $173.1 million in loanloss provisionswere taken for the year and $75.5 million for the quarter.   Douglas E. Johnson, Statewide's president and chiefexecutive officer, said that to meet the capitalrequirements, the bank needs about $75 million in new equitycapital. Although a &quot;number of scenarios&quot; are beingconsidered for capital raising, Mr. Johnson said, Statewidecould still fall short of levels required by the comptroller.   The total reserves for loan losses at March 31 increasedto $110.5 million, while nonperforming assets rose to $232.5million.</TEXT></DOC>
