However, they cautioned that the new laboratory development _like other incremental advances in AIDS research _ was far frombeing ready for clinical application and, at best, might offer apotential new treatment approach rather than a cure.   Dr. Jonathan W. Uhr, chairman of the department of microbiologyat the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas,said a study to be published Friday shows a synthetic moleculecalled recombinant CD4 can used in a test-tube to deliver a killertoxin to cells infected with AIDS.   Uhr said the CD4 molecule naturally binds to a gycoprotein,called gp120, that forms on the surface of cells infected with humanimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDs.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   It's beginning to look a lot like a tight inventory Christmas.

The measures were presented to Parliament the day after a man andhis granddaughter were killed in a bungled Irish Republican Armybombing. They are virtually certain to pass in the 650-member Houseof Commons, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has a huge101-seat majority.   Her government suggested the anti-violence oath last year as ameans of undermining the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, inits attempt to win political legitimacy in Northern Ireland.   At the heart of Sinn Fein ideology is support for what it callsthe IRA ``armed struggle'' and the government calls terrorism.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Overseas sales by U.S. arms manufacturersshrank significantly in fiscal 1987 despite a strong demand forweapons by Middle East countries, a new study concludes.   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. was one of the few major defensecontractors to buck the industry slump and managed to assume theposition of No. 1 arms exporter with sales totaling $657 million,the study adds.   ``The value of contracts awarded to U.S. defense contractors formilitary equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell infiscal year 1987 for the second year in a row, to $4.9 billion _ off22 percent from the 1986 level and a whopping 44 percent below1985,'' concludes the report.   ``The overall decline in Foreign Military Sale awards led to adrop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 U.S.arms exporting companies in 1987.''</TEXT><DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran and Iraq began a 10-day exchange ofsick and wounded prisoners of war Thursday, but a jet chartered bythe International Red Cross shuttled fewer men than than promisedbetween the enemy capitals.   The plane flew 52 Iraqi prisoners to Baghdad and 19 Iranians toTehran.   Iraq accused Iran of reneging on an agreement to exchange 115Iraqis for 41 Iranians on the first day of the operation, in which1,570 men are to be repatriated. In retaliation, Iraq reduced thenumber of Iranians sent home.   A dispatch from Iran's official news agency, monitored in Cyprus,said fewer Iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked forpolitical asylum, 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 nolonger were eligible for repatriation because Red Cross doctorsfound them recovered from their illnesses.</TEXT><DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Deadlocked lawmakers Thursday averted thethreat of Thanksgiving dinner at the Statehouse by adopting anunprecedented ``speaker du jour'' plan under which a Democrat and aRepublican will preside on alternating days.
