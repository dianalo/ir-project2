Given theassociation between kilometric type III bursts and (He-3) rich events,the timing of the radio events is used to identify the related X-rayincreases. The X-ray events exhibit a rich variety, from the standpointof both intensity and complexity. Examination of the events shows statisticallysignificant anticorrelations between the He-3/He-4 ratio and the intensityof the event as measured at kilometric wavelengths and in hard and softX-rays; larger He-3/He-4 ratios occur in smaller flares. The result suggeststhat a coupling may exist between the preheating phase and the accelerationphase of these events or that mixing occurs between an enriched particlepopulation accelerated within the compact flare and a normal populationaccelerated by a shock propagating away from an intense flare. 13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
