Bruce Walter, president of Fremont, Calif.-based notebook maker GRiDSystems Corp., speaking at October's Comdex/Fall '91 show in Las Vegas.andP;  &quot;Ifyou talk to computer purchasers, to a person they believe that dockingstations are important.andP;  The only problem is that nobody buys them.andP;  The fewthat do -- just 10 percent of the market -- is really not reasonable [enough]to justify the effort.andP;  Only some customers require it.&quot;andM;Apple may agree.andP;  &quot;Docking stations are costly,&quot; said Randy Battat, vicepresident for portable computing at Apple.andP;  &quot;If you're using one merely toget expandability, you can do that with our notebooks today.andP;  If you thinkabout how you would like to use a desktop computer in conjunction with anotebook computer, what's more important are products that can solve otherproblems like data reconciliation.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
