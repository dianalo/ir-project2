The former officer, Alex Marrero, 34, and federal drug agentJorge Villar, 44, were charged with conspiring to distributecocaine and conspiring to commit bribery after their weekendarrests, which followed a sting operation.   Marrero's acquittal in the beating death of businessman ArthurMcDuffie sparked a riot that left 18 people dead and caused $80million in property damage in May 1980.   U.S. attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Marrero and Villar hadoffered to protect a man who was posing as a smuggler bringingcocaine from the Bahamas into an area near Miami Beach. The man wasactually working with government agents.   Marrero and Villar ``provided protection for this load ofcocaine and in return demanded a fee of $300,000,'' he said, andMarrero got 10 percent of the fee in cash.   According to an affidavit, Villar had certificates of depositworth more than $300,000 in a briefcase when he was arrested.   ``Today we demonstrate no matter who you are or what you thinkyou know, if you deal in drugs you can be caught,'' Lehtinen told anews conference.   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ordered Marrero and Villarback to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, where theyhave been held without bond since Saturday.   Prosecutors asked that they be held as dangers to the communityand because of the risk they might flee. Turnoff said he would makea decision on bonds for the two Tuesday.   Diane Cossin, executive assistant to Lehtinen, said convictionon the conspiracy and bribery charges would lead to automatic10-year federal prison terms for the two men, and possible lifesentences. She said other charges may be filed.   Marrero was suspended from the Metro-Dade force early in 1980after an investigation revealed that McDuffie had been beaten todeath by police officers after a highway chase. Marrero, the chiefdefendant in the case, was charged with second-degree murder.   An all-white jury in Tampa later acquitted him and three otherofficers of all criminal charges. Within hours, the Miami area,especially suburban Liberty City, was rocked by riots that lastedthree days.   Marrero later tried to rejoin the Metro-Dade police force, butin 1981 a county hearing examiner upheld his firing. He has heldseveral jobs since, including security guard and personal bodyguard.</TEXT></DOC>
