East of the Urals, the West Siberian basin occupies anarea of over 2 million km/sup 2/. The northern part of the world's largestconcentration of oil and gas reserves: about 18 billion barrels of oiland 545 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas. The resource potential hasbeen estimated to include an additional 54 billion barrels of oil andat least 948 Tcf of gas. The basin is bounded on the west by the Urals,on the east by the Siberian platform, and in the south by the Kazakhstanfold belt. One of the fields in the basin, Urengoy, is the world's largest,and contains more proved gas than is left in the entire United States.This field may soon supply much of the nation's gas, as well as a sizeableamount of the gas consumed in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
