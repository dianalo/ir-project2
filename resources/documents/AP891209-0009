Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in an interview Fridaythat he expected the administration would reach a decision byApril, predicting that Poland and Hungary could be earlybeneficiaries of a more liberalized policy.   The dispute involves a 40-year-old prohibition intended to keephigh technology products with military applications from fallinginto Communist hands.   The administration is under growing pressure to ease thecontrols as a way of boosting the economic and political reformssweeping through Eastern Europe.   Western allies argue that with Cold War frictions easing, it isimportant for the West to supply the technology needed forCommunist countries to boost living standards.   Controls on high-technology exports are administered by theCoordinating Committee on Multinational Export Controls, known asCOCOM. It consists of the 15 NATO nations along with Japan andAustralia.   Mosbacher said the administration hoped to reach a decision oneasing controls in time to present the proposals at the nextmeeting of COCOM, scheduled for early April in Paris.   Mosbacher said that Hungary and Poland are already discussingwith U.S. officials how to prevent the transfer of militarilystrategic items to neighboring Communist bloc countries. He saidthat such assurances would allow the United States to lookfavorably on giving those two countries access to moresophisticated technology.   ``Everybody is discussing what we should be doing about EasternEurope, whether it is politically, economically ortechnologically,'' Mosbacher said in an interview with TheAssociated Press.   The United States is considering ``a shortening of the list (ofrestricted items) to those things which are truly important andessential,'' Mosbacher said in a separate interview taped forpublic television's American Interests program.   ``The shortening will be substantial ... that would be ourrecommendation,'' he said.   The administration has been split between hardliners such asDefense Secretary Dick Cheney, who oppose the easing for nationalsecurity reasons, and others such as Mosbacher, who argue thatliberalization is needed in light of the changes.   Mosbacher was the third administration official in recent daysto discuss the possibility of lowering export controls. Similarcomments about possible changes have also been made by TreasuryUndersecretary David Mulford and Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger.   Eagleburger said the United States planned to eliminate thecase-by-case approval required to export ``dual use''high-technology items to other COCOM members.   ``Dual use'' refers to technology that has both commercial andmilitary applications. The United States has repeatedly clashedwith its allies, especially West Germany, Italy and Japan, overwhat it argues are violations of COCOM rules regarding dual usetechnology.   In the latest such case, the administration accused the Italiancomputer manufacturer Olivetti of selling the Soviet Unioncomputerized machine tools that the Soviets used to make jetfighter engines.   In a speech last week, Eagleburger said the requirement forindividual licenses will be lifted within six months.   Referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports toEastern Europe, Eagleburger said the ``nature of the militarythreat faced by the West is changing'' and the West needed to``signal our clear willingness to respond constructively to thedemocratization under way in Eastern Europe.''</TEXT></DOC>
