Growth for the pay networks has come to a near standstillover the past two years, and now some major cable-systemoperators are reporting significant declines in paysubscriptions. While industry wisdom says basic cablesubscriptions won't be hurt in a recession because Americanswill stay at home and watch TV more, consumers may cut frillslike pay channels.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Clearly, in a down economic period, pay TV is a tougherproposition,&quot; says Robert Stengel, senior vice president atBoston-based Continental Cablevision Inc. He says theincrease in pay-network disconnections at his company's cablesystems has been significant, particularly in the Northeast.   According to figures compiled by Paul Kagan Associates,subscriptions in the pay-TV category were flat last year,with some services posting small year-to-year subscriptiondeclines. Time Warner Inc.'s powerful Home Box Office, whichwowed operators with annual growth of a million units or morein the mid-1980s, reported subscriber increases of only athird of that in 1990. Walt Disney Co.'s Disney Channel,buoyed by its family appeal, was the only service to post asignificant rise.   To stem the erosion, archrivals Home Box Office and ViacomInternational Inc.'s Showtime are mounting aggressivemarketing attacks. Home Box Office, which operates both HBOand a sister service, Cinemax, has started defensive TV adsmaintaining that now is the time to hang on or hook up. It'salso increasing the funds it gives cable operators for localmarketing. Showtime, which also operates a sister channel,the Movie Channel, has just begun a drive imploring cableoperators to institute a rate structure that would makeShowtime more affordable.   The pay networks face a tough sell. The cable industry wasfreed to raise prices after broad deregulation in themid-1980s, and efforts last year to re-regulate industryprice increases failed. As a result, the monthly charge forbasic cable now runs more than $20 in many cities, and itcosts an additional $10 or more to subscribe to one payservice.   At biggest risk in the recession are the so-called &quot;secondtier&quot; networks like Cinemax and Showtime. HBO has less toworry about because it is the largest service, with more than17 million subscribers. It is also the first service manycable operators offer in typical package deals; to getadditional pay services, subscribers often have to buy a moreexpensive package. To get Showtime on some Long Island cablesystems operated by Cablevision Systems Inc., a subscriberhas to buy a package costing more than $60 a month.   Showtime, meanwhile, is betting its future on a bold planthat would roughly halve the cost of a subscription forviewers. Called &quot;TOPS,&quot; which stands for Total Optimizationof Premium Services, the plan would also reduce the wholesalecost to cable operators but would require them to sharplyincrease subscription volume to make a profit. Instead ofcharging $10 a month, for example, Showtime argues that cableoperators should charge only $4 or $5 to a much larger groupof subscribers.   &quot;The cost of access to the premium services has gonethrough the roof,&quot; says Matthew Blank, executive vicepresident of marketing at Showtime. &quot;We're trying toeliminate some of the barriers that the marketplace has puton us.&quot;   But the plan could backfire, some cable operatorscomplain. They say that subscribers may take the discountedShowtime and then disconnect HBO or other services on whichthe operator has much higher profit margins. It would work,they say, only if the higher Showtime volume came solely fromsubscribers new to the pay category. &quot;We told them we're notwildly enthusiastic about it,&quot; Continental Cablevision's Mr.Stengel says.   Mr. Blank concedes that cable operators have been slow toembrace the concept. But he says some have agreed to test thenew rate structure in a few markets.   Pay networks face other pressures. In the last year, manycable operators have become stingier in dispensing discountsto attract subscribers to the pay networks.   Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cableoperator, this year is halting programs that offer consumerslow prices for a few months' sampling.   &quot;When you remove the discount and go back to regularprices, people aren't interested and disconnect,&quot; says JohnJ. Sie, a senior vice president.   But the company is studying how to arrest the decline inpay subscriptions; at the start of 1990, 50% of its basicsubscribers took an extra pay service; by the end of thethird quarter, that number had dropped to 42%.   HBO, which says it spends about $150 million on marketingeach year, is pumping more money back to its local cableoperator affiliates for cooperative marketing efforts. At anannual meeting with about 50 of its top affiliates in Hawaiilast month, HBO's chief executive, Michael Fuchs, urged thecable operators to focus on &quot;stabilizing&quot; pay TVsubscriptions. Mr. Fuchs says he warned them that &quot;this is aproduct that's got to be marketed on a daily basis.&quot;   As it has in the past, HBO is pitting its Cinemax servicedirectly against Showtime, trying to persuade operators tofavor Cinemax when selling subscribers on a second service.Ads in a trade-magazine campaign say Cinemax is&quot;unquestionably the perfect service to complement HBO.&quot;   But persuading consumers to keep one pay network in arecession will be hard enough; getting them to buy two may bedownright impossible. And even HBO's biggest customers saythe leader would be seriously affected if the recessiondeepens. &quot;When the whole category is dropping, No. 1 getshurt, too,&quot; Tele-Communications' Mr. Sie says.   HBO says its national consumer advertising campaign isaimed primarily at bolstering HBO's image as a value-addedservice. &quot;In a recession, it may be that people tend to stayhome and economize,&quot; says Jeff Bewkes, executive vicepresident at HBO. &quot;We're just trying to remind people of thequality of HBO programming.&quot; Its ad features movies like&quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; that will play on HBO thisyear. &quot;Yes, HBO in 1991,&quot; an announcer says in thecommercial. &quot;A ray of light in an otherwise yuck year.&quot;   HBO executives say the network expects to do at least aswell in 1991 as it did in 1990, adding 350,000 to 400,000subscribers. The company is hedging its bets withdiversification into such businesses as sports pay-per-view,home video and foreign markets, but says it remains confidentin pay TV. &quot;We're not going to add millions of subscribers ayear -- those days are over,&quot; says Mr. Fuchs. &quot;But thisbusiness can still be very healthy and show some growth.&quot;   ---        The Viewership Picture for Premium Channels                                                                                                                  Number of subscribers, in millions                                                                                                                            Home Box Office                                                                                                        1986                 15.0 1987                 15.9 1988                 17.0 1989                 17.2 1990                 17.5                                                                                                                                Cinemax                                                                                                        1986                  4.2 1987                  5.1 1988                  6.0 1989                  6.4 1990                  6.3                                                                                                                                Showtime                                                                                                        1986                  5.3 1987                  5.9 1989                  7.4 1990                  7.4                                                                                                                             Disney Channel                                                                                                        1986                  3.2 1987                  3.8 1988                  4.3 1989                  4.9 1990                  5.5                                                                                                          Sources: Paul Kagan Associates</TEXT></DOC>
