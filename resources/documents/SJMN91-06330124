The pitch will be alittle easier.&quot;;   The team's 8-3 record, with an Aloha Bowl matchup againstGeorgia Tech still to come, means Stanford could finish with its best recordsince Bill Walsh's 1977 squad won the Sun Bowl to finish 9-3. Win or lose onChristmas Day, the Cardinal is already assured of its best, and first winningseason since 1986.;   Though Stanford's recruiting classes have ranked amongthe top four in the Pacific 10 over the past three years, Sparks can alreadytell that recruits are more impressed with what Stanford has done.;   &quot;Whenyou call on the phone they say, 'Good game,' or 'So, you're going to the AlohaBowl,' &quot; Sparks said. &quot;There's immediate recognition there.&quot;;   The Cardinal'svictory over UCLA on Nov. 9 may have increased its chances of landingoffensive lineman Jeff Buckey, a 6-foot-5, 280-pounder from Bakersfield whocould step in and anchor the line if junior tackle Bob Whitfield bolts for theNFL a year early.;   Buckey, whom some publications rank as the third-bestlineman prospect in the country, is interested in Stanford, UCLA and NotreDame. He attended the Stanford-UCLA game.;   Allen Wallace, editor ofSuperPrep magazine, predicts a shift in recruiting power from South to Northbased on Stanford's and Cal's success. &quot;Cal and Stanford are nationallyranked, Stanford beat Notre Dame in its own backyard (last year) and USChasn't beaten Notre Dame in nine years. It will be interesting to see howStanford and Cal deal with their superior positions.;   &quot;If you wanted torecruit against Stanford in the past you would suggest that it's a greatschool but that it's tough to get in a big-time bowl game,&quot; Wallace said. &quot;Butnow you can't make that argument without looking foolish.&quot;;   ThoughStanford's success may lead to better recruiting classes, it isn't likely toaid this year's hopefuls in their bid for NFL jobs.;   Whitfield and fullbackTommy Vardell, whom ESPN analyst Mel Kiper projects as early round draftpicks, would have been thoroughly evaluated regardless of how well their teamperformed since they were projected as potential NFL players before theseason.;   &quot;Brad Muster went in the first round and he played on some prettybad teams,&quot; Kiper pointed out.;   Though receiver Chris Walsh may get a closerlook because of the team's higher profile, he's still a projected late-roundpick or free agent.;   &quot;Sure it gets him a longer look, but Chris Walsh is apossession receiver and possession receivers are a dime a dozen,&quot; Kiper said.&quot;Just because he gets a longer look doesn't mean he'll go higher in the draft.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANNETTE JOHN-HALL, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  527  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 25, 199100330124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
