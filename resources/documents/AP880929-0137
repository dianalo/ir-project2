In a separate incident near Manila airport, police killed fourrobbers who attacked an American army officer lured into a car by aPhilippine woman, police said.   Also near the airport, soldiers shot and killed six people whorefused to stop at a checkpoint, police said. Troops said thepassengers opened fire.   Among those arrested for planning to topple Mrs. Aquino'sgovernment were three former soldiers and two civilians, said Brig,Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila military commander. Four were arrestedlate Wednesday and the fifth was captured Thursday, he said.   Biazon told reporters one of the suspected subversives wasMaster Sgt. Domingo Escarcha, alleged founder of the Black ForceCommandos, a group of renegade soldiers who staged several coupattempts.   Biazon said nearly 70 suspected right-wing extremists werearrested in recent weeks, including Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, aleader of last year's bloody coup attempt, who was arrested Tuesday.   He said that during the raids, police found documents pointingto financial support from unidentified ``outside sources.'' He didnot elaborate.   On Tuesday, Biazon said the latest series of arrests ``severelycrippled'' recent attempts by subversives to launch another coupattempt. He said more arrests were expected.   Biazon told a House of Representatives committee Wednesday thatunidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were undersurveillance for possible links to military renegades, includingformer Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.   Honasan led the failed Aug. 28, 1987 coup, in which at least 53people were killed and 300 were wounded. Matillano was one ofHonasan's lieutenants in the coup attempt. Both were arrested andescaped separately in April.   Honasan was chief of security under former Defense Minister JuanPonce Enrile, who was fired in 1986 after a failed coup attempt byhis followers.   Sen. Enrile, vice chaiman of the Union for National Actionoppositon party, denied Thursday he was personally linked to themutineers and said he was ready to defend himself in court if thegovernment tried to implicate him.   Also Thursday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told acongressional committee that the military estimated about 25,800Communist rebels were operating nationwide, of whom about 12,800were armed. The rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency toestablish a Marxist state.   In the robbery near Manila airport, U.S. Army Capt. MichaelSmith was offered a ride to his hotel by a woman shortly after hearrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Tokyo earlyThursday, police said.   They said the woman told Smith she would charge him less thanthe regular taxi fee and he agreed. Soon after, she stopped thecar, telling Smith she had a flat tire.   Four armed men asaulted the American officer, robbing him of hisvaluables and luggage and driving off with him. They dropped Smithoff behind the suburban Makati Medical Center and sped away.   He then flagged down police, who pursued the robbers and shotand killed them, police said. It was not known what happened to thewoman.</TEXT></DOC>
