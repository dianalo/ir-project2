Sihanouk said the communist Khmer Rouge and its enemy, theVietnamese-installed government in Cambodia, have the same stand _``they are opposed to the sending of an international peacekeepingforce'' after a political settlement of the 9-year-old war.   ``Why? Because the Khmer Rouge, they want to retake power, totake our Cambodia like (they did) in April 1975 after the departureof foreign troops.''   Sihanouk talked to reporters after meeting with U.S. Secretaryof State George P. Shultz. The two men were in Bangkok forconsultations between foreign ministers of the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations and Western allies.   Shultz gave Sihanouk a letter from President Reagan declaringthat the prince has a central role in a Cambodian settlement andthe Khmer Rouge must not return, said State Department spokesmanCharles Redman. Reagan assured Sihanouk the United States willcontinue to pressure Vietnam until all its troops leave Cambodia,Redman said.   Fears of a Khmer Rouge return to power have heightened asVietnam has begun a claimed withdrawal of 50,000 troops and theKhmer Rouge has been reported storing arms for an offensive.   The Khmer Rouge seized power with the fall of the U.S.-backedLon Nol government in 1975 and killed hundreds of thousands ofpeople until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.   The Khmer Rouge is now the most powerful group in a three-partyguerrilla coalition headed by Sihanouk.   During this week's consultations, Japan announced it wouldconsider funding an international peacekeeping force. Sihanouk saidFriday that the United Nations must dispatch a strong enough force``to prevent the Khmer Rouge ... from taking our Cambodia.''   Sihanouk said it wasn't possible to disarm the Khmer Rouge's40,000 troops because the main source of weapons, China, was not infavor of that.   He favors forming a national army comprising the three guerrillagroups and the pro-Hanoi government.   The prince charged that Vietnam also wanted the Khmer Rouge toreturn to power so it could again invade Cambodia after its statedplan to pull out by 1990 and tell world leaders that it waspreventing a Khmer Rouge takeover.   Shultz met Friday with Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda ofThailand, which gives sanctuary to Khmer Rouge guerrillas, and theyagreed that the Khmer Rouge ``should not be allowed to have aleading role'' in a future government, Radio Thailand said.   Also Friday, Sihanouk and Indonesia's Foreign Minister, AliAlatas, said they would attend peace talks on Cambodia planned forJuly 25 despite Vietnam's threats to cancel its pledge toparticipate. The talks in Indonesia's capital of Jakarta would bethe first to involve all the warring parties.</TEXT></DOC>
