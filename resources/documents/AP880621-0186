(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal agency labeled it a terroristattack and a congressman equated it to putting razor blades inHalloween candy.   Nails had been driven into 200-year-old Douglas fir trees downthe side of Holcomb Peak in southern Oregon's Siskiyou Mountains ina zig-zag pattern like a spray of bullets from a machine gun.   The practice is called tree spiking, an attempt to save trees bymaking it dangerous to cut them down and mill them. When a logger'schainsaw or a band saw hits a nail, it can break, sending metalflying like shrapnel.   Overall, environmental groups believe that logging has reducedold-growth forests to 10 percent of the 25 million acres they oncecovered Oregon and that represent a unique ecosystem that must bepreserved.   ``Tree-spiking is a radical environmentalist's version of razorblades in Halloween candy and rat poison in Tylenol,'' U.S. Rep.Bob Smith, R-Ore., said after the spiking was discovered last month.   Endorsed in the 1985 primer for environmental sabotage,``Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching,'' spiking has lostany legitimacy it may have had, even among members of the radicalenvironmental group Earth First!, known as the Monkeywrench Gang,which stages protests.   But this incident could well be a sign that the war of the woodsis escalating as opponents become discouraged with the loss of thebiggest trees in the forest, environmentalists and federalofficials say.   ``The way I see it, it's a last resort of people who are reallytotally frustrated with the process,'' said Robert Brothers, anEarth First! Siskiyou activist who lives in this small communityoutside Grants Pass.   ``As long as they don't kill anybody, it's fine with me. As longas they do it someplace else. Not in my backyard. Then we have todeal with talking about tree spiking pro and con instead of talkingabout old-growth pro and con.''   Steve Marsden, another Earth First! activist, said he has seenspiked trees logged anyway and left on the forest floor to rot.   ``Personally, I don't think it works,'' said Marsden, of WolfCreek. Logging companies ``just cut them down to show they are theboss.''   The Holcomb Peak spiking won't stop the area from being logged,said Hank Snow, vice president at Medford Corp., which owns theright to log trees in the area. He said the timber company woulduse metal detectors to look for spikes before cutting them down.   ``We don't like to even comment on (spiking),'' he said.``People are only seeking publicity.''   Timber is Oregon's leading industry, providing 73,900 jobs.Forest products output for 1986 in Oregon was $3.4 billion,according to the state Department of Economic Development.   The Holcomb Peak incident was discovered after anonymous letterspostmarked in Chicago were received by the U.S. Bureau of LandManagement and Medford.   An axiom of tree spiking is to issue a warning, so no one getshurt, although a California millworker was critically injured lastyear when a band saw broke on a spiked tree.   When news of the Holcomb Peak spiking failed to appear in localnewspapers, the spikers apparently got impatient and left nailsalong the side of a logging road to point the way, said HaroldBelisle, manager of Land Management's Grants Pass Resource Area.   Kurt Austermann, spokesman for Medford District, said the Bureauof Land Management considers spiking terrorism. Austermann saidMonday that the reward for information about the spiking incidenthad reached $13,000.   The Holcomb Peak incident was the third spiking in recent yearsin the Medford District in southern Oregon, said Linda Schalk, alaw enforcement agent for the federal agency.   Andy Kerr of the Oregon Natural Resources Council said peoplewho spike trees are frustrated with environmental organizations,like his, that stress negotiation, legal action and buildingcongressional support.   ``We get nasty letters from these people,'' he said. ``Wewouldn't go out and sit in front of bulldozers or spike trees, sowe're wimps.''   Litigation has been the most successful means of haltingold-growth logging. The latest victory for environmentalists camein a preliminary injunction issued by a federal appeals court thatblocked 33 timber sales in Oregon pending the outcome of a lawsuitover protection of the Northern spotted owl. The case was broughtby a coalition of about a dozen environmental groups, including theOregon Natural Resources Coaltion.</TEXT></DOC>
