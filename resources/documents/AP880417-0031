North and John M. Poindexter could play a major rolein determining public reaction to a pardon by President Reagan,experts say.   However, the experts disagree whether a pretrial or post-trialpardon _ if Reagan should decide to take that course _ would bemore acceptable to Americans.   Some of the university professors and senators interviewed byThe Associated Press said pardons before trial would be moreacceptable. This way, the prosecution would not get a chance tobring out potentially damaging evidence.   But others said pardons before trial would bring an immediateassumption of guilt, and they suggested that Reagan await aconviction if he wanted to forgive the defendants.   If there is no trial or verdict by next January, according tothis view, Reagan should leave office without taking action.   The issue is not merely an academic argument, because the trialdate is a hotly contested pretrial matter in the courtroom of U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said last week he'll byready for trial in July, but the defense team sought a March 1989trial date for North, a former National Security Council staffer;Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser; and two menrecruited by North, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secordand his business partner, Albert Hakim.   The four face charges that they stole government property asthey conducted secret arms sales to Iran and aided the NicaraguanContras during congressional bans on such assistance.   The 23-count indictment charges the four ran the Iran-Contraaffair as a broad criminal conspiracy to defraud the government andto cover up their actions. North, Secord, and Hakim are accused ofpersonally enriching themselves as a result of the Iran-Contraaffair.   Taking the view that a pretrial pardon would be the rightcourse, Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor, said,``If the prosecution can prove the heart of this case, which ismore about embezzlement than aiding the Contras, pardons will causea much greater storm (after trial).''   Dellinger added, ``This may look like a very different caseafter trial than it did after the congressional hearings, one thepublic is far less likely to view charitably.''   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of Senate JudiciaryCommittee, said pardons would be ``tougher to justify'' beforetrial.   The defendants would be ``presumed guilty all the time'' ifpardoned before trial, Grassley suggested. If the trial has notbegun when Reagan leaves office in January, Grassley said, thedefendants would ``have to rely on the good will of anotherpresident.''   Citing former President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon,Grassley said he's ``not sure'' Reagan ``wants to make his place inhistory by pardoning people. It didn't do Jerry Ford any good.''   The pardon may have cost Ford the presidential election of 1976and is the most remembered act of his presidency.   Reagan has not taken an official position on pardoning any ofthe defendants. On April 6, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid, ``I have raised the issue with the president four or fivetimes myself. I've heard it raised by others, and every time thepresident says the same thing, which is, `I'm not discussingpardons.'''   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said pardons would be easier beforea trial to ``spare America this pain'' of reliving the Iran-Contraaffair in the courtroom. Hatch was a member of the SenateIran-Contra committee.   William Leuchtenburg, professor of history at the University ofNorth Carolina, said a pretrial pardon would be more difficult forReagan, ``because of the gaffe'' he made on March 25 _ when heappeared to prejudge the case by predicting an innocent verdict.   Reagan said then, ``I still think Ollie North is a hero'' andadded, ``I just have to believe they're going to be found innocentbecause I don't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or anycrime.''   Later that day, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker saidReagan was expressing a personal view, adding, ``I think thepresident made it abundantly clear that he expects the legalprocess to run its course.''   Leuchtenburg said the worst scenario for Reagan would be if atrial was under way at the time he's ready to leave office.   ``That would create an all but impossible situation for apardon,'' he said. ``That would really produce a cry of outrage. Itwould particularly disturb the legal community by taking somethingaway from the legal process, and undercutting the judge and jury.''   James David Barber, a Duke political science professor, said``Pardoning in advance of their trial is wrong. The evidence is thewrongness recognized by the American people in Ford's pardon ofNixon. There was surprise that the president's rating plummeted sofast after the public rallied around him as the new president.   ``Some people say you go down in history. Some say you getwritten up in history. I would suspect if Reagan did it (grantpardons), it would be a mark on the scroll of history, but on thedown side.''</TEXT></DOC>
