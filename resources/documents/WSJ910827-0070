Seventeen brokerage houses have admitted paying about $1.3billion in compensation to more than 600 clients in thenation's securities industry scandal. Such compensation isn'tillegal unless promised in advance. But it has raisedquestions about fairness and the ministry's adequacy inpolicing the industry.   Mr. Hashimoto, testifying before a parliamentary panel,also said a compensation ban hadn't been warranted as thescope of the practice -- noted in the ministry's 1984 annualreport -- had been small. A late 1989 ministry guidelinesuggested avoiding making such payments.   The Japan Securities Dealers Association has adopted areform program, including qualifying examinations forsecurities sales representatives, a code of conduct, outsidemembers on the group's ethics panel, and stricterinspections.                                                                                                          FRANCE MAY CUT FIRMS' TAXES                                                                                                          In preparing next year's budget, some French financeofficials and parliament members are proposing to reducecorporate income taxes sharply to a single 33.3% rate overthe next two years. Companies now pay 34% tax on profits theyreinvest and 42% tax on profits they distribute toshareholders. Paris has insisted on the dual rate toencourage investment and discourage investors from pocketingprofits. The tax-cut idea reflects a shift by some officialsto link economic prosperity with unfettering firms.                                                                                                          GERMANY EASES LOAN RULES                                                                                                          Bonn will assume 40% of the risk that banks used to incurin making special low-interest loans for eastern Germaninvestment. This applies to credits of up to one millionmarks ($571.9 million) through Germany's European RecoveryProgram to establish smaller companies, and is likely toallow loans that would have been denied because of highrisks, such as insufficient guarantees and unclear propertyownership. Separately, Berlin will cut 10,000 civil servicejobs, raise company taxes and sell state-owned firms to plug1992 budget gaps.                                                                                                          MEXICO-CHILE FREE-TRADE PACT                                                                                                          Mexico and Chile have concluded negotiations on afree-trade pact. The accord is to take effect next year, whennon-tariff trade barriers will be dropped. Duties on mostproducts will be phased out in steps by 1998. Bilateral tradenow is $150 million a year.                                                                                                          SEOUL'S RATE DECONTROL PLAN                                                                                                          South Korea has drafted a plan to decontrol the nation'sinterest rates by 1997. The four-step plan is intended toprevent sudden rate increases, protect bank profitability andavoid financial instability. By early next year, financialinstitutions will set rates on short-term instruments andsome deposits. In 1993, rates will be liberalized on mostloans and deposits with maturities of more than two years.Threeyear decontrol of nearly all remaining loan and depositrates will start in 1994. In 1997, the market will determinebond rates and financial institutions will set demand andother deposit rates.                                                                                                          TAIPEI OFFERS LOAN TO MANAGUA                                                                                                          Taiwan tentatively agreed to offer a $30 million loan toNicaragua to help Managua repay its $310 million ininternational debts. Since the two nations establisheddiplomatic relations last November, Taiwan has provided loanstotaling $100 million to Nicaragua. The latest agreement cameduring a visit by an official delegation from Taiwan, whichis recognized by only 29 states and has had the most successin winning influence in Central America, where Taipei agreedin June to provide $150 million to a regional developmentbank.                                                                                                          ROMANIA TO INDEX PAY, PENSIONS                                                                                                          Bucharest will index salaries to the Romanian economy'sgalloping inflation rate, to ease the pain of price boosts.   Salaries, pensions and welfare payments will be adjustedevery three months to a level averaging about 40% of theinflation rate, which is expected to top 200% this year. Thefirst adjustment will be made in October. Each is to reflectprojected price increases in a basket of goods during thefollowing quarter.   The indexation won't affect about 3.5 million workers inthe emerging post-communist private sector, including twomillion farmers. Romania's work force totals about 11million.   The cabinet decision was the latest attempt to shieldRomanians from the effects of the government's multistepprice liberization program, launched last November. Priceshave since risen about 160%, exceeding pay boosts. All pricecontrols are to be abolished by December.
