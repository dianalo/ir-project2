In 1987 a new Manitoba Drillingincentive program was developed to encourage operators to drill for oilin Manitoba. Operators are provided with royalty/tax free &quot;holiday volume&quot;of oil This holiday volume is sensitive to oil price and dependent onthe well's location, depth, producing formation and qualifying creditsfrom previous dry holes. The program applies to wells drilled on eitherCrown or freehold owned mineral rights. An incentive program has alsobeen developed to encourage maximization of oil reserves through enhancedoil recovery projects. Eligible projects will be granted reduced royaltyand tax rates. Both incentive programs are designed to provide greaterencouragement for new exploratory well drilling while also assistingdevelopment drilling and ensuing maximum oil recovery from existing wellsthrough enhanced recovery. Also described are the Canadian Explorationand Development Incentive Program (paying a third of a company's eligibleexpenses to an annual spending limit of $10 million) and the resourceallowance (providing oil and gas producers with a deduction in computingincome equal to 25% of certain resource profits). 15 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
