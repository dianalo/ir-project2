Becauseof its long half-life, 1.6 {times} 10 {sup 7} year, and active behaviorin biological and environmental systems, it has the potential for accumulatingin the environment from long-term, chronic releases. When the PUREX Plantat Hanford restarted reprocessing fuel in 1983, monitoring for {sup 129}Iwas included in the environmental monitoring program conducted by PacificNorthwest Laboratory (PNL). Low levels of {sup 129}I have access to environmentalpathways from past airborne releases, current releases to the atmosphere,and ground-water seepage into the Columbia River. 4 refs., 2 figs., 1tab.</TEXT></DOC>
