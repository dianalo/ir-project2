The rules, which help define hazardous waste, were thrownout by the federal appeals court here on the ground that theagency had not properly sought public comment when it imposedthem 11 years ago. Under the regulations, any waste isconsidered hazardous if it is mixed with or derived from asubstance that is officially classified as hazardous.</LP><TEXT>   In a move that could come as early as today, the agencyplans to take action to keep the rules in place for now,either by seeking a rehearing by the court or by putting therules out for a new public comment period. In its orderstriking down the old rules, the court said the regulationscould be maintained temporarily during a comment period. Inaddition, however, the EPA plans to announce that it willseek to limit the rules, probably by creating a so-called deminimis standard, that is, a level of hazardous content thatwouldn't automatically trigger a classification as hazardous.   Industry has long pushed for such an exception, arguingthat it is burdensome and unnecessarily costly to subjectmaterial with minimal amounts of hazardous content to thestringent record-keeping and disposal rules that apply tohazardous waste.   &quot;It's not unusual to find plants spending millions ofdollar per year per plant for waste&quot; that is unfairlyclassified as hazardous, said Michael Steinberg, an attorneyat Morgan Lewis andamp; Bockius who argued the regulations onbehalf of the American Petroleum Institute and Shell Oil Co.,a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group. He said the rules affectmost major industrial facilities.   EPA officials, in fact, were considering whether topropose a de minimis standard even before the court decision.The effort has gained new urgency, however, because of thedecision and because it has become a focus of the Bushadministration's deregulatory push, under which all agencieswill be reviewing their regulations with an eye to slashingundue costs.   Environmentalists are wary about any effort to limit therules. &quot;The devil's going to be in the details,&quot; said KarenFlorini, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund.&quot;What are the numbers and are they set up in a fashion that'senforceable?&quot; At the same time, she said that if new rulesallowed industry and the government to concentrate on greaterhazards without abandoning protection where it is needed,that &quot;could be win-win.&quot;   It isn't clear whether the EPA, in seeking to narrow therules, will simply issue a proposed adjustment, or will firstset up negotiations between industry and environmental groupsto forge a consensus. Either way, the issue is likely to bedecided in a matter of months, although it also isn't clearwhether the agency will commit itself to any specifictimetable. Industry groups and officials from the White HouseOffice of Management and Budget are pressing for an early EPAproposal.   The agency also will be seeking assurance from the courtthat it won't be vulnerable to lawsuits from companiesarguing that the action by the court or the EPA has made thepast 11 years of enforcement invalid.   The hazardous-waste rules fall under the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act, the nation's mainwaste-disposal law, which is up for reauthorization thisyear. Industry or environmental groups that are unhappy withthe EPA action may seek to remedy the situation throughlegislative changes.</TEXT></DOC>
