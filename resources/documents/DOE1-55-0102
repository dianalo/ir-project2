Teikoku Oil Company transports the natural gas produced in theHigashikashiwazaki and Minaminagaoka gas fields to the markets in differentprefectures. The overall length of the pipelines is 520 km. The increasein demand for natural gas, and the seasonal and daily variations of gasdemand require appropriate adjustment of the demand and supply, the stablesupply of natural gas, and the securing of safety. In 1981, a pipelinesupervisory control system was introduced. A purpose of this system liesin the optimized adjustment of demand and supply, the early-detectionof abnormalities, and quick countermeasures for the abnormalities, andthe automation of data processing. Informations of the branches are fedto a sub-center, and then to a supervisory center, where the informationsare processed. The demand and supply of natural gas, and the facilitiesare continuously monitored by using CRT displays. In event of any accidentsuch as the exceeding of a pressure lower limit or a flow rate upperlimit, and the occurrence of earthquake, countermeasures such as alarming,emergency interruption, restriction of flow rate, and so forth are taken.(9 figs, 1 ref)</TEXT></DOC>
