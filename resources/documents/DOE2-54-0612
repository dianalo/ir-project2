The systemcan also be used to study the optimal location of new garages. A heuristicprocedure is proposed for solving this problem because of the varietyof operational constraints which must be respected. These constraintsinclude the requirement for trips of a subset of routed to be assignedto a specific garage, to only one garage among a given subset, or tobe split amongst no more than two or three garages. Constraints on theminimum and maximum number of buses assigned to a garage for peak andoff-peak services are also imposed. The problem and solution methodsare discussed in the context of the Montreal Transit Commission, wherethe system will be implemented. 8 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
