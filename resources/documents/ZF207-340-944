(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Fraser, Donald M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Two-pass geometric transformation algorithms are simpler andeasier to implement than traditional one-pass algorithms,requiring less computer memory and simplifying pipelined parallelcomputation.andP;  Reported problems with corruption at high spatialfrequencies have limited the universal adoption of this method.andO;An experimental study seeking to resolve the question of possiblecorruption is presented.andP;  Researchers computing the mean-squareerror while rotating a sinusoidal test image determined that thetwo-pass algorithm is effectively as accurate as the one-passalgorithm.andP;  The expected corruption results from poor methods ofinterpolation.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsGeometryMathematical ModelsComputer GraphicsParallel Algorithms.andO;Feature:   illustrationgraph.andO;Caption:   Mean-square error (graph)Smoothed e squared vs wavelength lambda for a rotation (graph)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
