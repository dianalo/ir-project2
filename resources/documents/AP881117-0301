The marketing drive is an effort to capitalize on a recentfederal court ruling that ordered the local Bell operating companiesto stop discriminating in favor of American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. on collect, third-party and coin-paid long-distance calls placedfrom public phones and calls charged to Bell company credit cards.   The court ordered the Bell companies by Jan. 1 to let owners andmanagers of public pay phones choose a long-distance carrier.   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company afterATandamp;T, said it will offer a full range of basic operator services topay phone users beginning next year. Also, non-MCI customers usingpay phones pre-subscribed to MCI would be able to use Bell callingcards.   The company said it will target its campaign at owners andmanagers of pay phones at airports, hotels, universities, governmentagencies, convention centers and other facilities with large amountsof pay phone use.</TEXT></DOC>
