Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican member on the Senate Banking Committee, told a press conference that as many as 70 Toshiba plastic-injection-molding machines could be delivered to various U.S. manufacturers because the Reagan administration hasn't yet adopted regulations to implement the ban.    The Utah lawmaker appealed to President Reagan to issue an executive order to enforce the ban immediately. The letter he sent to the White House also was signed by Sens. Alfonso d'Amato (R., N.Y.), John Heinz (R., Pa.) and William Proxmire (D., Wis.).    Sen. Garn led a Senate effort to attach the ban to the 1988 trade act to punish Toshiba Machine for illegally shipping computerized milling machines to a Soviet shipyard. U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Soviets used the equipment to make submarines that are much quieter, and thus more difficult to detect.    The machines being delivered to U.S. buyers are less militarily sensitive. They are used by manufacturers to produce various plastic materials.    Toshiba Machine, a unit of Toshiba Corp., of Japan, concedes that it is making some such deliveries, but it insists that that these transactions are within the U.S. law because the orders were received before Aug. 23, the day President Reagan signed the legislation.    &quot;Not one of these orders was received after Aug. 23,&quot; a lawyer for the Japanese concern said. &quot;Some have been in our books since March.&quot;    In fact, the date beyond which imports of the company's products are prohibited is yet to be established by published regulations.    Sen. Garn acted in response to complaints from the Society of the Plastic Industry, a U.S. trade association whose members manufacture machines similar to the ones Toshiba is selling in the U.S. Robert Branand, the association's lawyer, told reporters that Toshiba Machine's shipments could seriously undercut the U.S. industry.    The White House said federal agencies responsible for implementing the Toshiba ban are still wrestling with some complications in the legislation. &quot;The Toshiba language {in the law} wasn't tightly defined, so the regulations would have to help do the defining,&quot; said White House spokesman B.J. Cooper. He said a draft of the regulations, prepared by the Treasury and the U.S. Customs Service, currently is being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.    &quot;We don't have a specific date but we'll try to get them out in good time,&quot; Mr. Cooper added. </TEXT></DOC>
