But a leading backer of Nicaragua's Contra rebels, SenateIntelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., said thepresident had no choice but to send U.S. troops after the troops ofthe Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government reportedly attackedrebel camps inside Honduras.   He called the incursion a reaction to defeat of Contra aidlegislation in the House on March 3.   ``The Sandinista government has given its answer to Congress,''Boren said. ``This is their way of saying, `Thank you very much.You have taken the pressure off of us. We think we have this won inWashington. Now we're going to do what we've always intended andcrush the resistance forces.'''   Members of Congress on both sides of the divisive Contra aidissue said the incursion and the U.S. response would have littleeffect on prospects for a new aid package.   Administration officials, including Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, Assistant Secretary Elliott Abrams, Undersecretary forPolitical Affairs Michael Armacost and CIA representatives, went toCapitol Hill to brief lawmakers on the situation along the border.   But some members were withholding judgment on theadministration's troop deployment, saying there was too muchconflicting information coming out of the region to know what isreally happening and whether it was warranted.   ``It is a little hard to tell where the truth is,'' said Rep.Leon Panetta, D-Calif.   ``The problem with all of this is that our policy in CentralAmerica has been mired in deceptions and partisan confrontation,''he said. ``I think most members are suspicious ... This has thesmell of a ploy to provide military aid to the Contras.''   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior Republican on theHouse Foreign Affairs Committee, said after a briefing that thesituation is ``extremely serious. The longer the Sandinstas stay(in Honduras), the more it jeopardizes the peace process.''   He said lawmakers were being told that more than 1,000 Contratroops were hemmed in by Sandinista forces in the Bocay regionalong the border, and were in jeopardy.   ``The administration's actions have been very measured. It'sjust a psychological effect at this point,'' Broomfield said.   Added Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio: ``Unless Congress changes itsposition quickly, it's over. It's the beginning of the end. Thiswas inevitable, and it's a real tragedy.''   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., alsocalled the incursion serious and said he supported the troopdeployment. ``I believe it might do some good. The name of the gameis to get the Sandinistas to back off.''   House Democratic leaders questioned the administration'shandling of the entire affair, saying they had continually beenbriefed or notified of developments only after the White House hadreleased information to the news media, and as late as a few hoursbefore the decision to send troops to Honduras were told no suchaction was contemplated.   ``We were told that the administration was reviewing itsoptions, but the sending of troops was not among them,'' said HouseMajority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.   ``What we have seen over the past week is not an attempt tocommunicate with Congress or build consensus,'' he said. ``It is apublic relations campaign aimed at the media to resurrect thefailed policy of military aid for the Contras.''   Similar comments came from Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairmanof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``I am startled by the administration's decision to dispatchArmy units to Honduras, particularly as there was no priorconsultation with the Congress on such a momentous act ofescalation of the conflict in Central America,'' Pell said in astatement.   ``... To call hot pursuit an incursion or invasion is anexaggeration,'' he said. ``This creates a crisis atmosphere whichsome may have thought would squeeze more money out of Congress forthe Contras.''</TEXT></DOC>
