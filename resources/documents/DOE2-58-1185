This article is a report thereon. For an impeller and a casingof the pump, both of which receive considerable abrasion and corrosionfrom the slurry, a two-phase stainless steel has so far been used. Inthis development, particularly stabilized zirconia (PSZ) with the featuresof tenacity and strength at room temperature was selected as fine ceramicsmaterial and for an impeller, PSZ was used. The existing high aluminaporcelain was used for a casing. Since a large fine ceramics productis difficult to form, the test manufactured impeller (diameter; 26cm)is the largest ever made in terms of a single product. This was manufacturedthrough casting. Concerning its test in an actual macine, its operationhas already covered 16,000 hours, but no wear and abrasion nor crack,etc. has ever occurred in the PSZ impeller. (13 figs, 6 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
