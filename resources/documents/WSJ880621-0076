The mild-mannered political communique from the leaders of the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan reflected the relaxed political mood of the summiteers. Without any immediate crisis or dispute dividing the allies, the political discussions focused instead on their fascination with opportunities in the communist bloc.    &quot;We take positive note of Eastern countries' growing interest in ending their economic isolation,&quot; the communique said. &quot;East-West economic relations can be expanded and serve our common interests so long as the commercial basis is sound.&quot;    The leaders &quot;are certainly saying that change has occurred,&quot; concluded Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of state for European affairs.    The summit leaders made it clear, however, that they don't want to go too far, too fast with the Soviets. The communique included the usual U.S. reservations barring subsidized trade with the Soviets or transfers of goods or information considered strategic to the security of the participating nations.    Ms. Ridgway said this doesn't prohibit subsidized U.S. wheat sales. &quot;This is commercial lending of a different kind,&quot; she said. U.S. officials have been more concerned about the flow of investments to the Soviet Union, particularly on terms more favorable than those available in the normal market.    While the joint statement did not link trade with human-rights improvements in the Soviet Union, the Reagan administration has &quot;no plans except to enforce&quot; the current U.S. Jackson-Vanik law that does so, she said.    The leaders applauded the work of President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in reaching the intermediate nuclear-arms reduction treaty and explicitly reaffirmed the leaders' commitment to cuts in conventional forces. The statement brought the Japanese much more actively into the arms-control effort, linking concern about the Soviet military buildup in the Far East with concern about the Warsaw Pact's conventional-force superiority in Europe.    Condemning the Korean and Kuwaiti airliner terrorist incidents, the leaders supported a recent International Civil Aviation Organization declaration that hijacked aircraft shouldn't be allowed to take off once they have landed, unless there is &quot;an overriding duty to protect human life.&quot;    On the narcotics front, the summiteers endorsed a U.S. proposal for a new task force on international drug trafficking and money laundering. The task force will include ministers of participating nations -- which haven't yet been determined, according to Ms. Ridgway. They will study &quot;all facets of the illicit drug problem,&quot; including production, trafficking, and financing of the drug trade.    The leaders singled out concern about the need to &quot;trace, freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers, and to curb money laundering,&quot; but failed, aside from endorsing the new task force, to call for specific measures.    Expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; about increased instability in the Middle East, the leaders backed an international conference with an &quot;appropriate framework&quot; to help resolve the situation and applauded U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's diplomatic efforts in the region.    Separately, President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita signed an agreement to promote cooperation in science and technology. The agreement calls for both governments to provide comparable access to their government-sponsored or supported research in such areas as superconductors, manufacturing technology, and the environment. </TEXT></DOC>
