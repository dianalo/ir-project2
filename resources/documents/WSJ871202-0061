Some oil analysts believe the division is serious enough to threaten to prevent OPEC at the cartel's winter meeting in Austria next week from reaching an agreement on pricing and production levels. OPEC urgently needs to present a united front to defend against sluggish petroleum markets and weakening demand for its oil.    &quot;The ministers realize that the market is poised on the edge of a precipice,&quot; says Humphrey Harrison, London-based oil analyst with Banque Paribas. &quot;Yet the sacrifices that will be required -- if another price collapse is to be avoided -- call for a degree of compromise which the political and strategic divisions may not allow,&quot; he adds.    The oil ministers are scheduled to begin their winter meeting next Wednesday in Vienna to establish next year's benchmark price, currently $18 a barrel, and production ceiling, now 16.6 million barrels a day. OPEC's bylaws require that any action taken be formally approved by all 13 member nations of the cartel.    But Iran, going beyond the usual premeeting rhetoric and posturing, is vociferously pushing for a $2-a-barrel price increase to compensate for a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, the currency in which oil is priced.    Yesterday, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, boldly accused the Arab members of OPEC, who support Iraq, of trying to keep down the price of oil to hurt Iran, which needs higher revenue for its war with Iraq.    As quoted by the official Iranian news agency from Tehran, Mr. Aghazadeh forecast a &quot;difficult&quot; OPEC meeting because, he said, the Arab producers &quot;will attempt to damage the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran by pushing for lower oil prices.&quot;    He asserted that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had deliberately glutted world oil markets to pressure Iran's economy after last summer's Mecca riots, in which hundreds of Iranian pilgrims died. He also blamed Saudi Arabia and other Arab producers for &quot;unfounded accusations&quot; that Iran is discounting oil prices.    The harsh rhetoric signals quite a departure from the OPEC meeting of a year ago, during which this year's price and production targets were set. At that meeting, the oil ministers were successful in reaching agreement largely because Iran and Saudi Arabia set aside their differences and cooperated at the conference table.    The new Iranian allegations could end such cooperation, oil analysts suggested, even though Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, has said in recent interviews that the kingdom's political differences with Iran wouldn't affect OPEC discussions.    Even so, while Iran tries to rally support for a big price increase, Saudi Arabia continues insisting that OPEC preserve the $18 benchmark for another year. Moreover, it advocates increasing the OPEC production ceiling by enough -- to 17.5 million barrels a day, or possibly higher -- to provide Iraq with an output quota equal to Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day.    Iraq has a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day but refuses to abide by it unless it is as large as Iran's. As a result, Iraq currently is producing more than 2.7 million barrels a day.    Algeria, Libya and, possibly, Nigeria appear to be aligned with Iran. But new support for the Saudi view, already backed by Kuwait and other Arab producers, is coming from such OPEC conservatives as Venezuela and Indonesia.    Indonesia's oil minister Subroto told reporters in Jakarta yesterday that the OPEC benchmark should be maintained at $18. &quot;In view of the current market situation,&quot; he said, &quot;the possibility of a price increase is slim.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
