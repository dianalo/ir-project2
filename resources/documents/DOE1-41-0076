In a later study, they filled a 20 cm section of rigid coaxialline (ordinarily air-filled) with either normal (beef muscle or fat)or malignant (SMT-2A) tissue, and measured the temperature increase versustime at the irradiated tissue surface for the same absorbed power ineach tissue type. At an ambient temperature of 25{sup 0}C we made themeasurements from 50 to 915 MHz, and found from the initial temperatureincrease that the relative power absorption was greater in malignanttissue than in muscle or fat at each frequency tested, with the maximumagain occurring within the 150 to 400 MHz range. In the present studyconducted at an ambient temperature of 37{sup 0}C, the authors improvedthe accuracy of the temperature measurement system by computer-fittingtheir heating-curve data to an exponential solution of the bio-heat equationin order to determine the absorbed power. Again, the authors found themalignant-to-normal-tissue power absorption ratio to maximize withinthe 150 to 400 MHz range.</TEXT></DOC>
