As previously reported, the brokers recently brought suit against PaineWebber alleging they had been wrongly dismissed after being recruited from other brokerage houses through &quot;fraud and deception.&quot; The former brokers alleged PaineWebber hired them only to capture their clients' accounts. The suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan.    In a statement issued yesterday, the firm, a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc., said, &quot;the dispute with these former employees is old news. They worked for PaineWebber at various times between 1982 and 1985.&quot;    The statement added that the company previously had brought its own charges against the brokers, and that &quot;to the extent that there have been rulings in these proceedings, all claims based on these allegations have been dismissed. PaineWebber has already secured judgments against three of these individuals and is pursuing its claims against the others.&quot;    The judgments were in connection with disputes over amounts allegedly owed to the brokers when they were dismissed. </TEXT></DOC>
