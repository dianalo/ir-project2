Morten Wolstad of Statoil A@S said the company halted productionfor safety reasons when workers continued to defy a governmentback-to-work order as well as threats of dismissal. He saidproduction had reached a rate of 500,000 barrels earlier Friday,half of Statoil's capacity.   ``There just aren't enough people working out there,'' saidWolstad. The strike was in its sixth day on Statoil's Statfjord,Gullfaks and Veslefrikk North Sea fields and ``we aren't at allsure when it will end,'' he said by telephone.   Statoil provides the bulk of Norway's 1.6-million-barrel dailyoil output. Strikers on most other fields returned to workThursday, allowing some production to resume.   Phillips Petroleum Co. Norway expects flows from its sevenEkofisk area fields to reach normal daily levels over the weekend _about 220,000 barrels, the national news agency NTB said.   Numerous other fields depend on pipelines from Ekofisk to movetheir natural gas production to West Germany and Britain.   About 4,000 offshore workers went on strike last Sunday. TheNorwegian Federation of Oil Workers Union and the NorwegianConfederation of Business and Industry deadlocked on wage increasesand job protection from automation.   The government, saying Norway could not afford the loss, invokedcompulsory arbitration Monday and ordered the strikers back towork. Petroleum provides about 25 percent of the national income.   About 1,000 oil workers defied the order and continued thestrike illegally. Support for the walkout dwindled during the week,leaving about 300 striking at Statoil's fields Friday, NTB said.</TEXT></DOC>
