The March 27, 1989, documentdealt with establishment of seasons, limits and shooting hours for migratorygame birds under andSection;andSection;20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110of subpart K. A supplemental proposed rulemaking for both the early andlate hunting season frameworks appeared in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated June 6, 1989 (54 FR 24290).On June 22, 1989, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, to reviewthe status of woodcock, band-tailed pigeons, mourning, white-winged andwhite-tipped doves, sandhill cranes and other species. The meeting wasannounced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534) and June 6, 1989(54 FR 24290). Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these speciesand for rails; moorhens and gallinules; common snipe; sea ducks in theAtlantic Flyway; September teal; experimental September duck seasons inidentified States; experimental and special September Canada goose seasonsin portions of identified States; doves in Hawaii; migratory game birdsin Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; and some extended falconryseasons. Public comments on these matters were received.On July 13, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 29640) a third document in the seriesof proposed and final rulemaking documents. The third document dealt specificallywith proposed frameworks for the 1989-90 season. When published in a fourthdocument as final frameworks, wildlife conservation agency officials mayselect season dates and bag limits for hunting certain migratory birdsin their respective jurisdictions during the 1989-90 season.This rulemaking is the fourth in the series, and deals specifically withfinal frameworks for early-season migratory game bird hunting regulationsfrom which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, PuretoRico, and the Virgin Islands may select season dates and daily bag andpossession limits for the 1989-90 season. These seasons may open priorto October 1, 1989, and apply to mourning white-winged and white-tippeddoves; band-tailed pigeons; rails; moorhens and gallinules; woodcock; commonsnipe; sea ducks in the Atlantic Flyway; experimental September duck seasonsin identified States; experimental and special September Canada goose seasonsin portions of identified States; sandhill cranes in the Central and PacificFlyways; doves in Hawaii; migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico,and the Virgin Islands; and some extended falconry seasons. Late seasonsinclude the general waterfowl seasons; coots; moorhens; gallinules andcommon snipe in the Pacific Flyway; and remaining extended falconry seasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Public Comments</ITAG>Public hearing and written comments received through July 23, 1989, relatingto proposed early season frameworks are discussed and addressed here. Thecomments are discussed in the same order as the numbered items to whichthey apply. Only current numbered items are included. A continuous listof all the numbered items used in Service documents appeared in the March27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12534).1. Shooting Hours<T3>Public Hearing Comments:</T3> Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing theCentral Flyway Council and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, presenteda statement opposing restrictive shooting hours for early-season regulations.<T3>Written Comments:</T3> The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils;the Lower Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council;the States of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida,Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,and Texas; North Dakota Tourism Promotion; Ducks Unlimited, Alaska WaterfowlAssociation, California Waterfowl Association, Louisiana Wildlife Federaton,National Rifle Association, Sportsman Conservationists of Texas, and SouthCarolina Waterfowl Association; 6 local organizations; and 22 individualsopposed restrictive shooting hours as originally proposed in the March27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 54 FR 12539), for the 1989-90 migratory birdhunting season. The State of Wisconsin and 2 individuals were in favorof restrictive shooting hours.<T3>Response:</T3> After further review, the Service concluded that restrictiveshooting hours were not warranted for early-season hunting seasons. Restrictiveshooting hours for early season species would not benefit duck populationswhich are low in numbers and may further discourage hunters from participatingin hunting seasons and reduce support for habitat and management efforts.Late-season shooting hours will be determined at the same time as otherlate-season regulations are set.5. Sea Ducks<T3>Written Comments:</T3> A sportsman's organization supported the proposalfor the 107-day season and for a bag limit of 7 sea ducks.<T3>Response:</T3> The Service will continue a 107-day season with a baglimit of 7 sea ducks.6. September Teal Season<T3>Public Hearing Comments:</T3> Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing theCentral Flyway Council and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, presenteda statement in support of the September teal season.<T3>Written Comments:</T3> The Central Flyway Council; the Southern RegionRegulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council; the States ofArkansas, Colorado, and Louisiana; 2 organizations, 1 member of Congress,and 27 individuals from Texas; and 1 individual from Oklahoma requestedthat the September teal season be reinstated with restrictions as necessary.Arguments presented include:a. Artificial wetland areas will not be provided due to lack of incentive.b. Relatively low band recovery and harvest rates for blue-winged tealindicate there is little impact on the species.c. Population level is only slightly below the average since 1981.d. Breeding habitat conditions are similar to the conditions when theseseasons were implemented.e. Due to early migration of bluewings, suspension virtually precludesharvest in many States.The State of Wisconsin and 3 individuals from Texas supported suspensionof the September teal season.<T3>Response: </T3>Blue-winged teal were on a downward trend through the1980's, production has declined substantially, and the population is currentlyat a record low. The potential for population response is being diminishedby substantial deterioration in the quality and quantity of wetlands andupland nesting cover on the breeding grounds. Habitat conditions are notmuch better than in 1988 and the outlook for the fall flight is poor. Althoughband recovery and harvest rates for bluewings are relatively low, we havelittle predictive information on the effects of harvest on the populationwhen at this low level. The Service recognizes that the suspension willeliminate substantial portions of the harvest in some areas and this willresult in some unmeasured amount of habitat that will not be provided.However, in view of the very poor population status and production outlook,reinstatement of the September teal season is not warranted and is notoffered. The Service encourages private land managers to continue to providehabitat to benefit waterfowl at this time of the year, in anticipationof improved populations status in the future.8. September Duck Seasonsa. <T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Atlantic Flyway Council and the State ofFlorida recommended that the bag limit during the experimental Septemberduck season in Florida be 4 wood ducks only.<T3>Response: </T3>A bag limit of 3 wood ducks only per day for the regularseason was established in 1988 to limit the take of all ducks. Most specialseasons were cancelled. Bag limits for early wood duck seasons were reducedto 2 per day in Kentucky and Tennessee, and 3 per day in Florida. The Servicecurrently is reviewing harvest management strategies, such as Septemberduck seasons and special wood duck seasons. The review of harvest managementstrategies likely will not be complete until next year. For this year,the Service believes a bag limit to include 3 wood ducks only for the 5-daySeptember duck season in Forida is appropriate.b. <T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. Lauren Schaaf, representing the KentuckyDepartment of Fish and Wildlife Resources, presented a statement in supportof the experimental September duck season in Kentucky. Mr. John M. Anderson,representing the National Audubon Society, recommended that no liberalizationsbe allowed in these early wood duck seasons.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The States of Arkansas and Tennessee supportedthe proposal to continue the experimental September duck seasons.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service believes continuation of the restrictiveexperimental 5-day season for wood ducks in Kentucky and Tennessee is warranted.14. Frameworks for Geese and Brant in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length and Bag Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">Atlantic Flyway</ITAG><T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended thata 3-year experimental season be established for resident Canada geese inNorth Carolina. The season would include a daily bag limit of 2 geese fromSeptember 1 through September 10.<T3>Response: </T3>These frameworks offer such a season for the 1989-90hunting season.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mississippi Flyway</ITAG><T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that3-year experimental seasons be established in the Fergus-Alex zone andthe Southwest Border zone of Minnesota. The seasons would run from September1 to September 10 and are designed to harvest local Canada geese. The Statesof Minnesota and Wisconsin supported this recommendation.<T3>Response: </T3>These frameworks offer such seasons for the 1989-90hunting season.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pacific Flyway</ITAG><T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Pacific Flyway Council recommended thatthe special September Canada goose season in Wyoming be modified to include160 permits, for 2 geese per season, to be allocated among three areasin 1989.<T3>Response: </T3>These frameworks offer such a season for the 1989-90hunting season.16. Sandhill Cranes<ITAG tagnum="81">Central Flyway</ITAG><T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing theCentral Flyway Council and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, andMr. John M. Anderson, representing the National Audubon Society, presentedstatements in support of the proposed frameworks. Mr. George supportedthe expansion of the hunting area in north-central Texas. Mr. Andersonsaw no apparent reason to oppose the expansion in Texas.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Central Flyway Council recommended continuationof regular seasons without change, except to permit an expansion of thehunting area in north-central Texas.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service believes that the expansion is warrantedand that other frameworks should remain unchanged from those in effectduring the 1988-89 seasons.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pacific Flyway</ITAG><T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing theCentral Flyway Council and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, andMr. John M. Anderson, representing the National Audubon Society, presentedstatements in support of the proposed frameworks. Mr. George specificallysupported the option for Utah to initiate a sandhill crane season.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Central and Pacific Flyways endorsed a recommendationthat Utah be allowed a sandhill crane hunting season.<T3>Response: </T3>The sandhill crane hunt in Utah was presented as anoption to the State in 1988. The Service will again offer Utah that optionfor the 1989-90 hunting season. Other frameworks will remain unchangedfrom those in effect during the 1988-89 seasons.17. CootsThe California Department of Fish and Game requested that frameworks forthis species be separated from the duck frameworks to provide additionalhunting opportunity.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service notes that, nationally, coots and ducksare, and have been, regulated together, i.e., coot seasons are the sameas regular duck seasons. The Service intends to continue to regulate cootsand ducks together, but defers this issue to the late-season cycle.20. Common Snipea. The California Department of Fish and Game requested that frameworksfor this species be separated from the duck frameworks to provide additionalhunting opportunity.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service believes that this issue may be better handledthrough the late-season regulations process, and consideration of thisissue is therefore deferred.b. The Service notes that the paragraph dealing with hunting seasons forcommon snipe was misplaced under the heading rails in the July 13, 1989,<T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 54 FR 29647).21. Woodcocka. <T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. William Goudy expressed his oppositionto February woodcock hunting, especially in Tennessee. He feels it is wrongto hunt at a time when birds are beginning to nest and migrate to northernbreeding grounds. He further requests that the Service restrict the useof split seasons for woodcock. Mr. John M. Anderson, representing the NationalAudubon Society, strongly encouraged review of the effect of February huntingon nesting and population status. Mr. Charles Kelley, representing theAlabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, stated that Februarywoodcock hunting was halted in Alabama because some woodcock were nestingin February. Mr. Robert L. Miles, submitted a letter on behalf of the NortheastAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Resources Agencies, expressing concernfor woodcock populations and requesting careful monitoring and review ofhunting regulations for southern wintering areas.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The State of Tennessee stated that this seasonprobably has no significant impact on the population, but should data becomeavailable to the contrary, they would want to review and make appropriatechanges to this season.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service noted in the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(at 54 FR 12541), that it would discuss Februaryhunting of woodcock with the Flyway Technical Committees. This was doneand the Service intends to continue discussion and review of the issuewith all interested parties. A preliminary proposal concerning Februaryhunting of woodcock will appear in the March 1990 <T4>Federal Register</T4>.b. <T3>Written Comments: </T3>The State of Wisconsin supported the proposedframeworks and one individual requested relaxation of woodcock frameworksin the northeast.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service has continued the woodcock frameworks asthey existed during the 1988-89 hunting season.23. Mourning Dovesa. <T3>Written Comments: </T3>Tennessee requested the option of an 18-birdbag limit for mourning doves in the Eastern Management Unit.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service notes that States may currently select anoption that includes a 15-bird bag limit. The Service is not proposinga bag limit of 18 mourning doves in the Eastern Management Unit for the1989-90 season.b. <T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. Charles Kelley, representing theAlabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, supported theaddition of Barbour County, Alabama, to the south zone in that State.<T3>Response: </T3>The zone change requested by Alabama is reflected inthe mourning dove frameworks.c. <T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. John M. Anderson, representing theNational Audubon Society, encouraged continuation of restrictive regulationsinitiated in 1987 for the Western Management Unit and also expressed concernabout declines in some populations of the Central Management Unit.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Pacific Flyway Council supported the mourningdove proposed frameworks.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service will continue mourning dove frameworks asthey existed during the 1988-89 season.24. White-winged and White-tipped Dovesa. <T3>Public Hearing Comments: </T3>Mr. Ronnie R. George, representing theCentral Flyway Council and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, supportedthe modified proposal for the experimental aggregate bag limit in Texasduring the special 4-day white-winged dove season. Mr. John M. Anderson,representing the National Audubon Society, noted that white-winged doveregulations in Texas are complicated and research should continue. He furthernoted that the proposed regulations for south Texas appear to be reasonable.<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The State of Texas requested an experimentalaggregate dove bag limit for the special 4-day white-winged dove season.The request was later modified by Texas and subsequently endorsed by theCentral Flyway Council. This modified request is discussed in the July13, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 29640), and is contained in the frameworkspart of this document.<T3>Response: </T3>The experimental aggregate bag limit will be allowedin Texas for the 1989 season. Continuation of the study in subsequent yearswill be made on an annual basis.b. <T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Pacific Flyway Council recommended continuationof last season's white-winged dove frameworks in the Western ManagementUnit.<T3>Response: </T3>The 1989 frameworks for white-winged doves in the WesternManagement Unit are unchanged from those of 1988.25. Migratory Bird Hunting Seasons in Alaska<T3>Written Comments: </T3>The Pacific Flyway Council, the State of Alaska,and one sportsman's organization requested the same frameworks for 1989-90as was in effect during the 1988-89 migratory bird seasons, especiallythat shooting hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise be retained.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service is not aware of any reason to change theframeworks from those of last year. No benefit could be expected from restrictivemorning shooting hours in far northern latitudes and these frameworks areunchanged from those of 1988-89. The experimental tundra swan season istentatively approved, although a petition against all swan hunting hasbeen filed. The petition will be addressed with the late-season regulations.27. Migratory Bird Seasons for FalconersThe State of Wisconsin, 6 falconry associations, and 3 falconers have supportedthe proposed falconry regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service is establishing falconry frameworks as discussedin the July 13, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 29640).<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration</ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES-75-54)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) on June 6, 1975, and noticeof availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 13, 1975 (40 FR 25241). A supplementto the FES, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuanceof Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES88-14)'', was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9,1988, and Notice of Availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17,1988 (53 FR 22727).<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration</ITAG>On June 22, 1989, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservationconcluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modificationof their critical habitats.Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviatechances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protectionand conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats.The Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation undersection 7 is considered a public document and is available for inspectionin the Office of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Officeof Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.<ITAG tagnum="85">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291 and the PaperworkReduction Act</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis,and publication of a summary of the latter. These regulations have beendetermined to be major under Executive Order 12291 and they have a significanteconomic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documentswhich are available upon request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington,DC 20240. These regulations contain no collection of information subjectto Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.<ITAG tagnum="84">Memorandum of Law</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated March 27, 1989, (54 FR 12534) the Servicestated that it planned to publish its Memorandum of Law for the 1989-90migratory bird hunting regulations with its first final rulemaking.<T3>Memorandum of Law. </T3>Section 4 of the Executive Order 12291 requiresthat certain determinations be made before any final major rule may beapproved. Section 4(a) specifies that the regulation must be clearly withinthe authority of law and consistent with congressional intent, and thata memorandum of law be provided to support that determination. Also, theagency must state that the factual conclusions upon which the law is basedhave substantial support in the agency record and that full attention hasbeen given to public comments in general, and to comments of persons directlyaffected by the rule in particular.The development of the annual migratory bird hunting regulations is providedfor under section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, asamended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 701-718h). Such regulations have beenpromulgated annually since 1918. They appear in 50 CFR part 20, subpartK. Congressional support for the development of these rules and ancillaryactivities involved in their development are reflected in the U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service's budget. Among these activities are biological surveys,hunter activity and harvest surveys, research investigations, law enforcement,and administrative costs associated with the development and publicationof the proposed and final rules. Many other Service activities, such asthe acquisition and management of habitats for migratory birds, indirectlyassist in maintaining the migratory bird resource at levels which allowreasonable sport hunting harvest.In developing its annual hunting rules for 1989-90, the Service has publishedthree proposed rules for public comment and conducted one public hearingto facilitate public input into the rulemaking process. Four additionalproposed and final rulemakings, and another public hearing, are includedin the remaining schedule for establishing the annual hunting regulationsfor 1989-90. Numerous public comments summarized and responded to in <T4>Federal Registers </T4>listed in the preamble of this document describethe Service's consideration of the impacts of its proposed rules on thepublic. Many of these comments originated from affected State conservationagencies, while others were submitted by the affected public. Commentsin support of the Service's initial or supplementary regulatory proposalsare noted. Comments which do not support proposed Service action have beenadequately addressed. Additional public comments are invited and will beaddressed in subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>documents. The complete administrative record,including copies of public comments, is available for inspection at theOffice of Migratory Bird Management.Consequently, the Department has determined that it has fulfilled requirementsof section 4 of Executive Order 12291 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Actin developing the 1989-90 migratory bird hunting regulations which areadequately supported by the Service's records.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authorship</ITAG>The primary author of this final rulemaking is Morton M. Smith, Officeof Migratory Bird Management, working under the direction of Byron K. Williams,Acting Chief.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Promulgation</ITAG>The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting must, by its nature,operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service is of the viewthat every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possibleopportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed ruleswere published March 27, June 6, and July 13, the Service established whatit believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doingthis, the Service recognized that at the periods' close, time would beof the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date ofthese regulations after this final rulemaking, the Service is of the opinionthat States would have insufficient time to select their season dates,shooting hours and limits; to communicate those selections to the Service;and finally establish and publicize the necessary regulations and proceduresto implement their decisions.Therefore, the Service under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Actof July 3, 1918, as amended, (49 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 701-718h), prescribesfinal frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bagand possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliestopening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from whichState conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates andother options. Upon receipt of season and option selections from Stateofficials, the Service will publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 toreflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the contiguous United States,Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands for the 1989-90 season.The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the termsof 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act and these frameworkswill, therefore, will take effect immediately upon publication.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20</ITAG>Exports, Hunting, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife.The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1989-90 hunting seasonare authorized under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918 (40Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 701-718h); the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of1978 (92 Stat. 3112; 16 U.S.C. 712); and the Alaska Game Act of 1925 (43Stat. 739, as amended, 54 Stat. 1103-04).<ITAG tagnum="85">Final Regulations Frameworks for 1989-90 Early Hunting Seasons onCertain Migratory Birds</ITAG>Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Secretary of the Interiorhas approved final frameworks for season lengths, bag limits, shootinghours, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for mourning,white-winged and white-tipped doves; band-tailed pigeons; rails; moorhensand gallinules; American woodcock; common snipe; experimental Septemberduck seasons in identified States; sea ducks in the Atlantic Flyway; SeptemberCanada goose seasons in portions of identified States; sandhill cranesin the Central and Pacific Flyways; extended falconry seasons; and migratorybirds in Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.<ITAG tagnum="81">Notice</ITAG>Any State desiring its hunting seasons for mourning doves, white-wingeddoves, white-tipped doves, band-tailed pigeons, rails, woodcock, commonsnipe, common moorhens and purple gallinules, sandhill cranes or extendedfalconry seasons to open in September must make its selection no laterthan August 9, 1989. States desiring these seasons to open after September30 may make their selections at the time they select regular waterfowlseasons. Season selections for the seven States offered experimental Septemberwaterfowl seasons and Wyoming's special Canada goose season must also bemade by August 14, 1989.Atlantic Flyway coastal States desiring their seasons on sea ducks in certaindefined areas to open in September must make their selection no later thanAugust 14, 1989.
