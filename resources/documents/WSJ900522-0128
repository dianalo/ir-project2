Futures prices rallied last week on fears that rain-soakedfields were delaying planting to such an extent that cropyields could be reduced in many areas. But government andprivate weather forecasts released late Friday made it clearthat farmers in most midwestern states would benefit fromfair weather this week and most of next.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Overall, it's going to be drier and warmer, with highs inthe 70s and 80s across much of the heartland&quot; through nextweek, said Charles Notis, a principal in Freese-Notis WeatherInc., in Des Moines, Iowa.   The concern about the heavy rains of recent weeks tendedto obscure the importance of replenishing subsoil moisture inmany growing regions, analysts said. New grain hybrids alsoallow farmers to get crops in the field much later than indecades past and still reap average to above-average yieldsat harvest time. Analysts noted that during 1978 and 1981,wet spring weather hampered planting in many areas, buthardly made a dent in yields.   The stock market rally also has been sucking speculativemoney out of the grain trading pits in recent days that mighthave helped support futures prices, said Steven Freed, afutures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.   Soybean futures for July delivery fell 10.25 cents toclose at $6.1050 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Julycorn futures dropped 5.25 cents to close at $2.77 a bushel.   The outlook for an increase in export sales to the SovietUnion in coming months is becoming dimmer. Pravda and otherSoviet newspapers carried reports over the weekend andyesterday about a ministerial meeting at which speakers weresharply critical of the country's heavy reliance on foreigngrain imports and the amount of scarce hard currency devotedto grain imports over the past year, analysts said.   The Soviet Union needs grain imports &quot;like a drug addictdoes his needle,&quot; said one speaker at the meeting, accordingto wire service reports.   The implication of this latest salvo aimed at the SovietUnion's stumbling economic policy is that, with such internaldemand for hard currency, the Soviets aren't likely to bespending nearly as much on grain imports in coming months.   Some analysts are less concerned about future orders thanthey are about the likelihood that current bills will bepaid. Western trade specialists estimate that the Soviets areabout $1 billion in arrears on payments to foreign graintrading firms, including $250 million owed U.S. tradingfirms. European Community companies are owed as much as $350million, Japanese trading firms are owed $200 million andCanadian companies are owed $200 million, analysts said.   News on the diplomatic front also weighed on grain futuresprices. Secretary of State James Baker indicated after hismost recent trip to Moscow that the U.S. still hasn't decidedwhether to grant most-favored-nation status to the SovietUnion -- a step that would be expected to lead to new exportcredits extended to the Soviets, analysts said.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is scheduled to visitthe U.S. beginning May 30 for a summit meeting with PresidentBush, and many analysts had assumed that most-favored-nationstatus would have been assured by this point.   Another cloud over exports concerns China's trade statuswith the U.S. Its most-favored-nation status expires earlynext month. Sen. George Mitchell, (D., Maine), Senatemajority leader, said the tepid Bush administration responseto China's murderous quelling of student revolt a year ago isa failure, and he called for an end to China's preferentialtrade treatment.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum prices fell on little news exceptcontinuing worries over an apparent oversupply of crude oil.U.S. petroleum refiners reduced their field postings for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by 50 cents a barrelto $17.50. In futures trading, prices of both gasoline andcrude oil crumbled. June and July contracts for unleadedgasoline were down more than one cent a gallon on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange. The Merc contract for June deliverycrude declined 50 cents a barrel to $18.26. Some weakness inthat contract had been expected because it ceases tradingafter today. But the July contract also fell, by 38 cents abarrel to $19.04. Separate announcements by oil ministers ofSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that they areabiding by terms of the recent production agreement of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had negligibleimpact on the market. Saudi Arabia is believed to be reducingoutput to near the level of its quota of 5.4 million barrelsa day, but oil analysts said there isn't yet any evidence ofcutbacks by other OPEC overproducers. On the contrary, saidNauman Barakat, a Shearson Lehman Hutton first vicepresident, &quot;OPEC output in May could show a slight increaseover April, and that would be very negative for the market.&quot;   COPPER: Futures prices eased as the Peruvian laborsituation improved and supplies of the metal became moreample. The soonest-to-expire May contract ended with a lossof 1.70 cents a pound at $1.1990. The premium of May overJuly narrowed by 0.30 cent a pound because July was off 1.40cents to $1.1345. The premium of the London Metal Exchange'scash position over its three-months delivery also narrowedsomewhat. Copper inventories in warehouses of New York'sCommodity Exchange rose by 1,174 tons to 8,455 tons. Analystsexpect the London Metal Exchange today to announce anincrease in copper inventories of 2,000 to 6,000 tons. InPeru, workers at the Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s two minesand a smelter postponed until June 5 a strike that wasscheduled to begin yesterday. A spokesman for Southern PeruCopper in New York said the action was taken &quot;in anticipationof a voluntary raise {the company} will be making on June 4.&quot;Separately, analysts said that most of the workers atCentromin Corp., Peru's state-owned mining company, who wentout on strike a week ago, returned yesterday, although someremained out.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices failed to hold an early advance andended lower despite further unrest in the Ivory Coast, theworld's leading cocoa grower. The July contract finished witha loss of $31 a metric ton at $1,446 after trading as high as$1,485. The initial strength was attributed to news reportsthat the police in Abidjan, the nation's capital, had gone onstrike over working conditions and pay. However, militarypolice took over and the strike soon ended, reports said.Later, it was reported that dock workers, who were alsounhappy over pay and working conditions, had postponed ascheduled strike until June 5. One analyst observed that thestring of labor problems in the Ivory Coast lost their impactbecause the government had quickly moved to end each dispute.&quot;The government met the demands of the army recruits lastweek and now of the police. It is expected they'll do thesame with the dock workers, and prevent those problems fromgetting worse,&quot; said the analyst. Also important, he added,is that &quot;for all the furor, the harvesting, transportationand shipment of cocoa hasn't been affected yet.&quot;                                                                                                          COTTON: The soonest-to-expire July contract rose its dailylimit of two cents a pound, to 78.13 cents, because suppliesof immediately available cotton are tight. Other deliveriesgained by smaller amounts, ranging to slightly over one centa pound. Fundamentally, the advance was triggered by reducedsupplies of desirable types of cotton for shipment during thesummer. Such cotton would meet industrial needs prior to thearrival of cotton from the 1990-91 crop, which begins itsseason on Aug. 1, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist forPrudential-Bache Securities, New York. Buying was widespread,with demand coming from computer-guided funds, speculators,and &quot;local&quot; traders, who deal for their own accounts, Mr.Simon said. Buying interest accelerated as the Julycontract's price advance rose above 76.80 cents and then 77cents, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
