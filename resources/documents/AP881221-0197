Rockwell officials said the Department of Energy, which operatesthe plant about 17 miles northwest of Denver, would foot the bill,reimbursing the company if necessary. They denied the payment was acivil penalty.   Rockwell also said the payment was just a ``monetary payment'' toavoid litigation costs.   But the EPA said it was the largest civil penalty the agency everhas assessed against a contractor at a federal facility, and thefirst it has assessed for environmental problems at Rocky Flats.   The payment stems from two enforcement actions _ one in 1986 andthe other this year _ brought against Rockwell by EPA for allegedPCB, or polychlorinated biphenyl, contamination at the plant.   ``By agreeing to the terms of this settlement, Rockwell admitsthat the agency had the jurisdiction to bring the enforcementactions against them,'' said David J. Janik, the EPA attorney on thecase.   The energy department and Rockwell argued that Rockwell cannot befined by the EPA because Rocky Flats is a federal facility and EPAdoesn't fine other federal agencies.   ``It was Rockwell's position that the case should have been onebetween EPA and DOE,'' said company spokesman Pat Etchart, addingthat the agreement ``does not set a precedent because we do reserveour right to contest any future actions the EPA might take.''   Janik said Rockwell's argument that the payment wasn't a civilpenalty ``is completely incorrect.''   At Rockwell's request, Janik said, EPA agreed to leave the word``penalty'' out of the agreement, ``but they know the only authoritythe agency (EPA) has for taking money from anybody is through acivil penalty.''   Janik said it was ``beyond (EPA's) powers'' to determine whetherDOE can give Rockwell the money to pay the penalty. ``As a taxpayer,it doesn't sound very good,'' he said.   Workers at Rocky Flats use plutonium to make triggers for thenation's nuclear bombs.   The main plutonium processing building at Rocky Flats has beenclosed since early October following a safety violation in whichthree people were exposed to plutonium, but production at the planthas continued.</TEXT></DOC>
