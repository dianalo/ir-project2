 It's not every day that the most popular product in a specificmarket is replaced, but that's just what Hewlett-Packard did to the LaserJetII.andM;A workhorse in many organizations, the LaserJet II and its variants had anestimated 65 per cent of the Canadian market for office laser printers.andP;  Nowcomes the LaserJet III, with many new features -- and a lower price.andM;Different users will disagree about which change is more important.andP;  The mostvisible is scalable fonts, which will simplify life for anybody doing desktoppublishing -- no more having to generate fonts of every size you might want,and then upload them to the printer.andM;Mind you, only fonts which are built to support it can be scaleRd.andP;  Bothsans-serif (&quot;Univers&quot;) and serif (&quot;CG Times&quot;) scalable fonts are built intothe printer, in all combinations of bold and italic.andM;Engineers will like the inclusion of HP-GL/2 vector graphics as an integralpart of the PCL5 Printer Language.andP;  With appropriate software, plots shouldcome out a lot faster.andM;Small dot techniqueandM;Everybody with keen eyesight will like HP's &quot;Resolution Enhancement.&quot;andP;  Thistechnique uses small dots to fill in the &quot;jaggies&quot; we are so used to withlaser printers.andM;Resolution is still 300 dots per inch, but it looks like much more.andM;The LaserJet III also uses the same toner cartridges as the II and IIRd.andO;Font cartridges, soft fonts, and paper and envelope trays for the series IIwill also work with the III.andM;Memory cartridges are unique, though.andP;  The LaserJet III comes with basememory of 1 MB.andM;The biggest surprise is the speed with which software publishers havereleased drivers for the LaserJet III.andP;  Computing Canada On-Line users candownload drivers for Microsoft Word 5.0 and Windows 2.x, as well asWordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1.andM;The LaserJet III handles all the attributes in the WordPerfect 5.0 PrinterTest Document except outline.andM;At a time when when competitors were starting to catch up to the LaserJet II,Hewlett-Packard has jumped out in front again.andM;NoteWork.andP;  No network should be without e-mail.andP;  At the same time, it's notthe primary application, so it shouldn't take a lot of learning time.andP;  Forpeople with Novell networks, The Notework fills the bill admirably.andM;Within an hour of starting the installation, you can have dozens of userszipping messages back and forth.andP;  The inquisitive ones will try out itsfeatures over the next week, and be right up to speed -- probably withoutever cracking the manual.andM;Novices will be encouraged by graphics of an airplane delivering the mail,and a garbage can taking the discards.andP;  Once that becomes boring, they canturn the graphics off.andM;Surprising powerandM;For a simple e-mail system, The Notework has surprising power.andP;  It operatesas a Terminate and Stay Resident program, popping up when the user pressesAlt-Tab.andP;  It includes file transfer, and can capture a message to a file.andM;The biggest absent feature is the lack of distribution lists, although youcan send a message (or response) to multiple recipients.andM;Technically, The Notework takes a measly 5K of memory.andP;  Installation issimple, since The Notework reads the Netware Bindery to help build a list ofusers.andM;It will   cause problems if the network is short of directory space, sinceeach message is aandM;file.andM;Running The Notework, I found I had to re-boot after server crashes, even ifI was logged off when it crasheRd.andP;  Your users may not be used to doing this.andM;It's hard to imagine an easier way to get e-mail.andM;Mars 128 Hand-Scanner.andP;  Image processing is very trendy these days, so Ijumped at a chance to investigate the entry level.andP;  The Mars 128 is probablytypical of a number of similar scanners with slight feature differences.andM;The Mars unit scans an area five inches wide, allowing a full page to bescanned in two passes.andP;  It comes complete with an expansion board and twopieces of software.andM;Controls on the scanner select resolution of 200, 300 or 400 dots per inch,line art or three &quot;photo&quot; modes, and brightness.andP;  There is a window to helpline up scans, and a push-button to start the scanning.andM;The primary software is called Scankit.andP;  It's simple enough for a child touse, yet it can save images in most of the popular file formats.andM;For scanning grey-scale images such as photos, the process is slow -- notbecause of the process itself, but because you will want to scan severaltimes to get the best contrast and light level.andM;Scanning black and white -- line art -- the Mars shines.andP;  If your applicationrequires capturing signatures, it could be a great solution.andM;Sources: HewLett-Packard LaserJet III, list price $3,295.andP;  Available frommany computer dealers.andP;  Demo downloadable from Computing Canada On-Line.andM;The Notework, from Professional Productivity Corp, 72 Kent St., Brookline,Mass.andP;
