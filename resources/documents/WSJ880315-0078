The American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business says 16% of all authorized tenure-track positions are going begging at graduate and undergraduate business schools because there aren't enough Ph.D.s coming down the pike. To lure what scholars there are, the schools have boosted the average nine-month salary for a fresh doctorate to $40,600, up 8.8% from the year before. In accounting, finance and information systems, the initial pay is even more.    The University of Miami says it's forced to pay $55,000 for nine months' teaching plus an extra 20% in summer research support to compete for the best new Ph.D.s. The University of Chicago borrows more faculty members from other schools rather than lower its hiring sights. Columbia University copes by choosing experience over academic credentials; three of its full professors don't hold doctorates.    Many schools, however, insist on the advanced degree. &quot;Research is very important,&quot; the Wharton School contends.    STATES PUSH AHEAD with their own minimum-wage legislation.    While Congress continues to deliberate whether to raise the federal minimum wage from $3.35 an hour, where it's been pegged since 1981, 10 states and the District of Columbia have elected to go it alone with higher rates for their own jurisdictions. Washington, D.C., for instance, has a multitier schedule ranging from $3.50 to $4.85.    California, currently at the federal level, raises its minimum wage to $4.25 an hour in July. Connecticut lifts its rate to $4.25 from $3.75 an hour in October. In New York state, Gov. Mario Cuomo has proposed lifting the minimum to $3.75 but some legislative leaders want to go even further. They favor a three-stage increase to $4.65. In Congress, the House Labor Committee backs a four-year rise to $5.05 an hour.    DOES A PRIEST have the right to contest his dismissal?    The question is being raised by the Rev. Paul Cleu, a Roman Catholic priest, who was fired in October 1985 as an associate chaplain at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose, Calif., after 2 1/2 years. He wants his day in court to show that the dismissal violated the hospital's procedures. But the hospital, operated by a Roman Catholic order, contends any court intervention would interfere with its free expression of religion.    California courts have sided with the hospital. But Phillip Griego, representing Father Cleu, is preparing an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The priest, he contends, was fired for secular, not religious, reasons that violated his employment contract. Gregory McClune, the hospital's lawyer, responds that all aspects of the post are religious -- including hiring and firing -- when a priest is serving in an ecclesiastical role.    Both sides agree that a priest employed in a secular job has the same rights as any other worker.    ELDER CARE isn't always for elders. Aetna Life andamp; Casualty says the average age of employees applying for long-term chronic-care coverage is 40 at Procter andamp; Gamble Co. and 42 at Aetna itself. At American Express Co., which buys its coverage through Travelers Corp., the average is an even younger 37.    AN OUNCE OF . . . More companies are testing job applicants for drug use but fewer are screening workers already on the job, says the Employment Management Association. One in three companies considers drug testing but decides against it, chiefly out of fear of getting sued.    WHEN DO THEY WORK? Maytag Co.'s nonsupervisory employees last year turned in 6,346 suggestions -- an average of three per worker -- and more than 2,700 of the ideas were actually installed, the appliance maker boasts. Awards, which ranged up to $7,500, totaled $200,322 last year.    FEMALE EXECUTIVES are stay-at-homes. Only one in 20 corporate women travels for business, says Damin Aviation. Among male executives, by contrast, the rate is one in three. While one in six men prefers a day trip to an overnight stay, almost half the women want to go and come back in the same day.    FLEX-TIME isn't a cure-all, but many workers and firms love it.    Randall Dunham, a University of Wisconsin organizational psychologist, says flexible work schedules can help companies to attract and hold employees with specific outside time commitments, such as parents with young children. But he says the positive effects are limited; such flexibility doesn't have a broad impact on a worker's morale.    Still, Prime Computer Corp. hails flexible scheduling because it &quot;treats people as adults.&quot; With flex-time, declares Wells Fargo Bank, &quot;productivity increases and tardiness goes down.&quot; SmithKline Beckman Corp. acclaims its 14-year-old program as &quot;a big success,&quot; especially during the summer, when most headquarters workers elect to break at 3 p.m.    But Academy Insurance Group dropped its early-hours option when some clients couldn't get through.    THE CHECKOFF: Ivanhoe Communications, an Orlando television-production company, encourages workers to pull a prank a week, such as turn a snake loose in the office or stage a water-gun fight. . . . First-year office employees get 18 days of vacation and holidays, yet are out sick six more days and take an added personal day, says Temp Force, a temporary-worker agency. </TEXT></DOC>
