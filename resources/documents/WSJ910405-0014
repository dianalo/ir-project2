The law required New Jersey employers to offer time off,with company-paid health benefits, to workers with pressingfamily health needs. A state judge threw out the benefitsprovision of the law, ruling that any state legislationaffecting company pension and benefit plans is pre-empted byERISA, the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act.The federal law sets standards for such plans and precludesany overlapping state legislation, according to the opinion.</LP><TEXT>   The decision effectively wipes out the most ambitiousaspect of the law, which advocates had promoted as a model of&quot;family friendly&quot; legislation when it was enacted last May.Family leave covers time off for men and women to care fornewborns or seriously ill relatives.   Twenty-five states and Puerto Rico have passed laws thatoffer similar protection to employees who want their old jobsback after leaving work temporarily for family reasons. Butin most other states, employees must assume the cost ofcompany benefits. Only New Jersey required employers tocontinue paying company health benefits for employees onfamily leave.   The suit challenging the provision was filed by aconsortium of five business and trade groups and three smallcompanies. According to the New Jersey Business and IndustryAssociation, one of the plaintiffs, the mandatory benefitsprovision would have cost 3,687 New Jersey companies anaverage of $600 to $1,200 an employee a year. The plaintiffsargued that such mandatory benefits also infringed on laborcontracts and created special problems for companies withemployees in states with no or less liberal leave laws.   The decision upholds the plaintiffs' argument that statesare precluded from mandating any type of employee benefit,said Leo Motiuk, an employment law specialist whose firm,Shanley andamp; Fisher, in Morristown, N.J., represented the group.   Employers who fail to comply with the New Jersey law canbe sued by the state or by individuals for up to $5,000 perviolation, as well as for punitive damages. Enforcement ofthe mandatory benefits provision had been postponed pendingthe outcome of the suit, Mr. Motiuk said.   Deputy New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Burstein, whodefended the law, maintained that its provisions only&quot;tenuously affected&quot; the federal legislation and fell outsideits scope. No decision has been made on whether to appeal, hesaid.   President Bush last summer vetoed a similar parental leavelaw passed by Congress -- the Family and Medical Leave Act.That law would have required large employers to provide 12weeks of unpaid leave and benefits to workers at the time ofchildbirth, adoption or family medical emergencies, but itdidn't require employers to pay for the benefits. A similarbill has been reintroduced in the House of Representativesand is pending.   ---   CABLE-TV INDUSTRY suffers a setback in battle for accessto private property.   A federal judge in Grand Rapids, Mich., rejected thecontention of UACC-Midwest Inc., a cable franchise, thatfederal law grants cable operators the right to install theirsystems in private apartment buildings.   The suit brought by UACC-Midwest, a unit of United ArtistsEntertainment Co., Denver, is one of several similar suitsfiled by various cable operators around the country. Theindustry's contention is that the Cable Policy Act of 1984grants them the right to wire private buildings even ifowners object. Some federal trial courts have ruled in theindustry's favor; two major cases are pending in federalappeals courts.   John Mansell, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan AssociatesInc., called the decision &quot;a setback for the cable industry.&quot;He said the courts' failure to resolve the issue isfrustrating and costly to the industry.   Most of the access suits have been filed by cableoperators that have been granted local franchises in areaswhere rapid development is expected, Mr. Mansell said. Theoperators argue that their franchises include the right towire all private buildings. But often they are rebuffed bydevelopers of apartment buildings or planned communities thatwant to provide cable service by setting up their ownsatellite dishes. The developers contend the operators'access is limited to public utilities and right-of-ways.   In the case decided earlier this week, Edward Rose andamp; Sons,a Kalamazoo apartment complex developer, asked U.S. DistrictJudge Robert Holmes Bell to dismiss UACC-Midwest's suitbefore trial.   &quot;There is no indication in either the statute's expresslanguage or the legislative history that Congress intended togrant a right of access over property simply because of theexistence of utility transmission lines,&quot; Judge Bell wrote inhis decision granting the developer's motion.   &quot;This is a major victory for private operators,&quot; saidDeborah Costlow, the defendant's attorney and legislativedirector for the National Private Cable Association.   Spokesmen for United Artists Cable and UACC-Midwestcouldn't be reached for comment.   ---   GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. LOSES age discrimination case inMichigan.   A Wayne County Circuit Court jury has awarded $1.3 millionto Richard N. Pietsch, a 58-year-old former sales engineer atGE Fanuc Automation of North America, a GE joint venture inSouthfield, Mich., with Fanuc Automation.   The verdict is one of several recently nationwide in whichjuries have rejected the arguments of employers who claimedthey dismissed employees for economic reasons.   In the suit, filed in 1989, Mr. Pietsch accused GE of agediscrimination, breach of contract and failure to keeppromises made to him when he was hired in 1981.   At the trial, which ended earlier this week, Mr. Pietsch'sattorneys presented evidence that management had phased outMr. Pietsch's job over a two-year period and distributed hisduties to new, younger sales engineers.   In April 1988, Mr. Pietsch was notified that his job wasbeing eliminated. In letting him go four months later, thecompany used words such as &quot;lack of work,&quot; &quot;reorganization&quot;and &quot;reduction in work force.&quot; However, he was the onlyemployee fired at that time, his attorneys said.   Mr. Pietsch's attorney, David Kotzian, of the Southfield,Mich., law firm Sommers, Schwartz, Silver andamp; Schwartz, said&quot;The case is significant because many employers feel that ifthey characterize a termination as a `reorganization' or `areduction in work force,' then they avoid liability. Thisverdict proves that if the reorganization is a pretext fordiscrimination, then the company is liable.&quot;   A GE spokesman said, &quot;We feel the award is unjustified andare preparing appropriate motions to ask for a retrial.&quot;   ---   UNSECURED CREDITORS of Midway have retained a Chicago lawfirm.
