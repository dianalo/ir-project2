Crude prices had firmed Monday on news of the meeting inJeddah, Saudi Arabia, and on the kingdom's warning that oilmarkets would remain weak if the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries continued to produce above its first-halfceiling.</LP><TEXT>   Joining Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, were AliKhalifa Al-Sabah and Mana Said Otaiba, ministers of Kuwaitand the United Arab Emirates, respectively. All have beenaccused of contributing to the oil glut by producing morethan their OPEC quotas.   In an effort to blunt such criticism, the three ministersissued a joint statement last night through the Saudi PressAgency that affirmed their support for OPEC quotas andexpressed &quot;grave concern&quot; about pricing developments. &quot;Theydecided that the solution which can guarantee relativestability in the market is a commitment from OPEC members tothe production ceiling and to the quotas distributed amongthe member states,&quot; the statement said.   The ministers said they will continue consultations withtheir counterparts elsewhere in an effort to restorestability to markets. But they didn't promise any productioncuts in their own countries.   Industry analysts expressed doubt that the statement wouldprop up the price of oil. &quot;It's too bland to have anyimmediate effect -- considering the caliber of the people whomet,&quot; said Antonio M. Szabo, vice president of Bonner andamp; MooreMarket Consultants.   The meeting began too late to have any impact onyesterday's oil trading, and crude prices resumed their fall.In Europe, where oil markets had closed Friday and Monday forEaster, spot prices of North Sea crudes were down 10 cents to25 cents a barrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price ofWest Texas Intermediate for May delivery dropped 41 cents abarrel to settle at $17.44. Less volatile, the June crudecontract was down 28 cents to $18.39. Outer month crudecontracts were mostly higher.   Worries that the industry would report higher U.S. crudeoil inventories weighed heavily on the markets yesterday.But, after trading had closed, the American PetroleumInstitute released its latest U.S. oil statistics showingthat crude inventories were up only 814,000 barrels lastweek, much less than expected.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures rose amidreports that heavy rains are delaying the harvest in Braziland that cold temperatures would sweep across regions ofArgentina where the soybean crop hasn't yet been harvested.The weather forecast offset growing worries that the SovietUnion might sacrifice its chances to win Most Favored Nationstatus from the U.S. if tensions escalate over Lithuania'sdrive for independence. Yesterday President Bush warned thatthe U.S. might respond somehow if the Soviet Union cutsnatural gas supplies to Lithuania. Before the Lithuaniapredicament, U.S. grain traders had been speculating thatSoviet purchases of U.S. crops, in particular soybeans, mightincrease substantially if the Soviets received thepreferential treatment given to countries granted MostFavored Nation status by the U.S. Meanwhile, traders arecontinuing to shrug off reports that the Soviet Union ishaving trouble paying its debts in a timely fashion to U.S.exporters. Last week, some Japanese trading companiesextended credit to the Soviet Union so that it could continueto purchase U.S. goods. The Soviet Union has had an excellentreputation for several years of immediately meeting itsobligations to trading partners. However, the economicrestructuring under way in the country is causing disarray.The Soviet payment problems should become less of a factor inthe U.S. grain markets because Soviet purchases usually slowby late June. Prices of corn futures rose yesterday amidreports that cool wet weather is slowing the early plantingof the crop in the U.S. Prices of most wheat contractsdropped slightly.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell, then partially recovered. TheMay contract finished 0.25 cent a pound lower at $1.1625. Thecontract had opened off 0.70 cent and sank as low as $1.1450before rebounding. On Monday after New York's CommodityExchange had closed, Southern Peru Copper Corp. announced aforce majeure on April shipments because of a monthlongstrike by production workers. A force majeure allows acompany to stop shipments because of uncontrollable events,such as a strike. A senior executive at a major wire producersaid, &quot;The reason the force majeure had no effect is because{two weeks ago} any reasonable observer saw that the companywas essentially in one.&quot; Two other potentially price-firmingdevelopments also had no effect yesterday: The London MetalsExchange announced that its stocks at the end of last weekwere down 650 metric tons to 54,575, a 24-month low. Stocksat the Comex were off 58 tons to 3,504. John Gross, publisherof the Copper Journal, an industry newsletter, said he ispuzzled. &quot;The fundamentals are bullish and yet the marketseems to move lower for either technical or seasonalreasons,&quot; he said. He noted that the U.S. Mint's purchase ofcopper by regular tender yesterday wasn't particularlyencouraging with the price paid, after the usual adjustments,essentially equal to the Comex spot price. &quot;One news servicesaid it was constructive, but I don't read it that way,&quot; hesaid. Mr. Gross was encouraged by copper's closing above$1.16, which is viewed by market technicians as an importantsupport level, after sinking below it. However, Mr. Grossbelieves that bearish traders were probably encouraged byauto sales for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., whichfor the first 10 days of April were down sharply, along witha 9.3% decline in housing starts last month. The seniorexecutive at the wire-making company said he has seen somesigns of weakness with rumors of some brass mills sellingcopper from inventory. He added that he has spoken withseveral water-tube producers who confirm that business isn'trobust.                                                                                                          COCOA: Prices fell, with the May contract finishing $43 ametric ton lower at $1,259. According to Harry Schwartz,senior research analyst for tropical commodities at CargillInvestors Services Inc. in New York, cocoa's recent pricerun-up and subsequent sell-off were spurred by events inBrazil. &quot;The price drop is probably due to the perceptionthat cocoa shipments will soon resume and not due to actualshipments,&quot; he said. But Mr. Schwartz noted that the pricedecline could also be simply an expected correction. By themiddle of last week, May cocoa had climbed to $1,350 a ton,up nearly 30% from about $1,050 a month ago. That steepincrease came about, according to Mr. Schwartz, because ofthe Draconian economic measures introduced by the newlyelected president of Brazil to curb inflation. Among otherthings, the measures that were introduced included freezingnearly all bank account assets. Even though shipments mightsoon resume, Mr. Schwartz thinks that for the next 18 months,while these strictures are in force, cocoa producers mightnot have enough cash to purchase fertilizers and herbicidesfor their trees or, perhaps, not even have enough money topay for workers for harvesting the crop. &quot;Long-term thesedevelopments have to be bullish for cocoa prices,&quot; Mr.Schwartz said.</TEXT></DOC>
