Mitsubishi, Japan's largest maker of heavy machinery, said the company plans to raise its per-share dividend to seven yen (five cents) from six yen for fiscal 1989. The company last raised its dividend, from five yen a share, in fiscal 1986.    Officials also said the Tokyo company now expects pretax earnings to total about 135 billion yen, up from May's estimate of 115 billion yen. Net income is expected to be about 75 billion yen, up from the original projection of 60 billion yen.    Mitsubishi estimated that sales will amount to 2.05 trillion yen, up from the original estimate of two trillion yen.    Mitsubishi officials said the changes reflect strong domestic demand that keeps driving up sales, especially in the machinery division. </TEXT></DOC>
