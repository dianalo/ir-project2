The U.S. official said approval could come as soonas this week. The official added that the $200 million willbe deposited by Iran into a special account at the DutchCentral Bank from which outstanding claims made by the U.S.against Iran would be paid.</LP><TEXT>   The $200 million is part of an Iranian claim involvingabout $400 million in military equipment Tehran owned thatwas in the U.S. at the time of the Iranian revolution. Theequipment, impounded after the 1979 seizing of the U.S.Embassy in Tehran, includes one combat aircraft, severalhelicopters, a submarine, missiles and spare parts.   The U.S. contends that because the equipment was used andin the U.S. for repair at the time it was impounded, it isworth far less than Iran claims. The U.S. also contends thatthe balance owed is $93 million, plus interest, andnegotiations between the two nations are continuing.   Iran has said the total military-sales claim, whichinvolves about 1,200 items, is valued at about $11 billion.The U.S. contends that the figure is far lower. The tribunal,set up in 1980, is the only official point of contact betweenthe two nations. The tribunal has three judges appointed bythe U.S., three judges appointed by Iran, and three neutraljudges appointed by the six other judges.   The U.S. has denied that the negotiations, which have beengoing on for a decade, are related to the current crisis inthe Persian Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
