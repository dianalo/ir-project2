The experimental systeminvolves a disk electrode immersed in electrolyte and subjected to anaxisymmetric impinging jet of the same electrolyte. Ring-electrode experimentswere used to determine the value of the hydrodynamic shear and to identifythe geometric constraints under which the shear stress on the electrodesurface is a linear function of radial position. The geometric constraintsobtained were tighter than previously reported results. With the properexperimental design, the critical shear for removal of a protective filmcan be obtained by measuring the profile of an electrode subjected toa given jet velocity. This technique is illustrated for evaluation ofa commercial inhibitor in chloride solutions.</TEXT></DOC>
