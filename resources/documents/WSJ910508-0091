Late yesterday, Mr. Peters and other company executivescouldn't be reached for comment.</LP><TEXT>   When Sony Corp. acquired Columbia two years ago, thecompany made waves in Hollywood by hiring Peter Guber and Mr.Peters, whose longtime partnership as successful producersincluded such films as &quot;Batman.&quot; Mr. Guber, a lawyer bytraining, had some studio-management experience, but Mr.Peters, a onetime hairdresser who worked his way up to becomea top movie producer, had never worked within a big corporatestructure.   To get the producers, Sony bought their company,Guber-Peters Co., for about $200 million and promptly becameembroiled in a costly lawsuit with Time Warner Inc.'s WarnerBros. unit, where the two had an exclusive contract toproduce movies. The lawsuit was eventually settled.   In the two years since they became co-chairmen, Mr. Guber,who has the title of chief executive officer, has focusedheavily on corporate matters while Mr. Peters has continuedto focus on more creative issues. However, as the two built amanagement team for the Columbia and Tri-Star film units,they gave broad autonomy to the new heads of the studios --Frank Price at Columbia and Mike Medavoy at Tri-Star. Theyalso hired a number of other top industry executives, leavingMr. Peters with less to do in the corporate hierarchy.   Mr. Peters has often been controversial at Columbia, andmany in Hollywood have speculated that he wouldn't lastindefinitely in an executive post there, as much because ofhis restlessness as anything else.   However, he is regarded as a creative whiz, bringing in anumber of projects for the studio. His long partnership withMr. Guber has produced a close relationship, and he'sexpected to continue to act as an adviser to Mr. Guber.   Financial terms of the arrangement couldn't be learned.Sony struck an intricate arrangement with the pair inaddition to buying their company. According to documentsfiled at the time of the Columbia acquisition, Sony gave thetwo producers equity in Columbia.   They were to receive an annual salary of $2.7 million eachannually, rising to $2.9 million over five years. They andfive other executives were to receive an equity participationof as much as 8.08% of the increase in a &quot;formula-basedmarket value&quot; of the company in a five-year period.</TEXT></DOC>
