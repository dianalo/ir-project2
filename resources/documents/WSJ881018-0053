Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp.'s new AS/400 minicomputer, a machine that will help determine whether IBM does just all right or extraordinarily well in the fourth quarter and in 1989, has hit the ground running.    The machine's quick start appears partly responsible for better-than-expected third-quarter earnings that IBM announced last week. Consultants and market-research firms say IBM could sell as many as 25,000 units this year and more than 45,000 next year. At some $200,000 a pop, that is real money, even for IBM.    According to SoundView Financial Group Inc.'s arithmetic, the results would be startling. The securities firm, which recently more than doubled its estimates of AS/400 shipments through the end of 1989, figures IBM's minicomputer revenue could surge to $12.4 billion next year from $8.3 billion this year. SoundView figures that means IBM would account for more than two-thirds of the growth in the minicomputer market.    &quot;If IBM does this well, somebody's got to be hurt,&quot; said Steve Cohen, an analyst at SoundView. A stellar success could let IBM regain dominance in a market where Digital Equipment Corp. has bloodied it -- though Mr. Cohen thinks market-share gains will be at the expense of such companies as Wang Laboratories Inc., Data General Corp. and Prime Computer Inc.    Not everyone is quite so bullish. IBM has had apparent successes turn sour before, such as the 9370 minicomputer announced two years ago amid talk that it would overcome IBM's longstanding minicomputer problems.    Yet even skeptics say the machine will do extremely well. George Colony, a consultant at Forrester Research Inc. and a leading skeptic, calls the machine so underpowered that &quot;I've found frighteningly little interest in it among the Fortune 1,000.&quot; But even Mr. Colony says IBM will sell at least 200,000 of the machines over the next few years, which would generate some $40 billion of revenue.    The machine has been successful largely because IBM found a way to meld two predecessor machines, the System 36 and the System 38. The System 36 was known for having anemic performance but having loads of good software, while the System 38 was powerful but had little software. IBM managed to combine the best of both, producing a system that basically used the System 38's architecture and could run all the System 36's software.    That is important because many of this class of minicomputer are used by small companies or small units of big companies, and they tend to lack computer expertise. That means all the power in the world doesn't do them any good without software, like that from the System 36, that solves a specific problem and is easy to use.    Gil M. Russell, vice president, information services, at Eye Care Centers of America Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., said he replaced a Wang minicomputer with an AS/400 because &quot;we have some dramatic growth plans, and the software that was in place in the Wang computer couldn't take care of our growth.&quot; He said he considered some other systems -- &quot;I don't want you to think I have IBM stamped on my hind end&quot; -- but found much more software available on the AS/400 than on others he looked at.    IBM, whose secretiveness traditionally has bordered on paranoia, also succeeded by letting outsiders get involved very early. To make sure their software ran on the AS/400, IBM let software developers see the product as much as a year ahead of the June announcement.    Bill Grabe, the IBM executive who put together the marketing plan for the AS/400, said, &quot;We took lots more risks in terms of sharing the technology.&quot; In fact, there was more detail available in advance about the AS/400 than about any other product in the computer industry's recent history. But Mr. Grabe said IBM didn't want to repeat a mistake it has made before -- that of, in effect, telling customers at announcement time, &quot;Here's the technology . . . . You figure out what to do with it.&quot;    IBM also started training its salesmen six months earlier than normal, Mr. Grabe said, and began manufacturing six months ahead of normal practice to ensure that it would have ample systems available close to the announcement date.    A survey done for this newspaper by Computer Intelligence, a market-research firm based in La Jolla, Calif., found that most of the initial orders were from customers replacing the predecessor IBM products. But it also found reason for thinking IBM will win orders away from competitors. That's mainly because Computer Intelligence found that almost none of the early AS/400 customers had experienced the sorts of problems competitors had said they would find when they moved to the new IBM machine.    Of the 79 companies in the sample that had already installed a machine, Computer Intelligence found that 74% managed to move their System 36 or 38 software to the AS/400 within two weeks and that no one took longer than 30 days. Computer Intelligence found that most customers liked the AS/400's ability to hook up to personal computers and other computers in a network, even though some competitors have said that was a failing of the system.    Computer Intelligence found that 86% of the early customers were either satisified or extremely satisfied, and found none that wasn't at least fairly satisfied. Of the customers who bought an AS/400 as a pilot system, Computer Intelligence found them planning to buy an average of 22 more.    The firm found that IBM had also succeeded in getting customers to have the systems installed this year, which will be of major importance to IBM's fourth-quarter results. Even though the systems have been available in volume for only a couple of months, Computer Intelligence found that half of the 693 companies in its sample that had ordered systems planned to install them by year end.    &quot;It's already clear that the AS/400 will be a big hit,&quot; said David Andrews, a consultant with ADM Inc., Cheshire, Conn. &quot;The question is just how big.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM shares closed at $121.125, up $1.375.    ---                The Midrange Computer Battle              Share of world-wide midrange market               1984       1985      1986      1987    IBM         27%        28%       25%       24%    Digital     15%        16%       18%       19%    Source: International Data Corp.
