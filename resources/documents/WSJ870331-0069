Factor VIII, considered the largest and most complex molecule ever made with gene-splicing technology, now is extracted from human blood for use by hemophiliacs. Because of occasional contamination of blood supplies with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, and other viruses, hemophiliacs risk viral infections from use of factor VIII from natural sources. For that reason, demand for a synthetic version of factor VIII is high.    Two biotechnology companies, Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics Institute and South San Francisco, Calif.-based Genentech Inc., independently and almost simultaneously isolated the gene for factor VIII in 1984. Baxter funded development of the drug by Genetics Institute. Genentech has licensed its version of factor VIII to the Cutter Biologicals division of Miles Laboratories Inc., a unit of Bayer AG of West Germany. A Genentech spokesman said Cutter hasn't yet begun clinical trials with the drug. Officials with Cutter couldn't be reached for comment.    Another company, Rorer Group Inc., Fort Washington, Pa., has developed a version of factor VIII extracted from human blood with monoclonal antibodies, artificially produced molecules designed to stick to specific substances. </TEXT></DOC>
