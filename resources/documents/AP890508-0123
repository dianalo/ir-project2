Financial disclosure documents show that Wright rented out thehouse from 1979 through most of 1983 before selling it for morethan $250,000. Wright reported rental income in each of those yearsof $5,000 to $15,000, made possible because he and his wife hadmoved their belongings to housing provided by Fort Worth realestate developer George Mallick.   The housing Mallick provided, first in an apartment building andlater a condominium, was valued by the House ethics committee at$53,488 for the period 1979 through 1988 and is the basis for someof the 69 House rules violations alleged against the Texas Democrat.   Members of Congress are required to report their finances onlyin broad ranges, so it is impossible to determine the precise valueof the rental income from the disclosure documents.   Wright will have to defend himself beginning late this month ata trial-like disciplinary hearing, and on Monday he announced hehas assembled a three-pronged legal team to make his case beforethe committee, the full House and the public.   The team also was drafting defense motions which were expectedto be filed later in the week, contesting some aspects of thecharges. A media briefing on the defense arguments was scheduledTuesday.   At the same time, Wright continued to be pummeled by newsreports of other questionable financial dealings, including a WallStreet Journal story citing a number of free flights accepted byWright in 1983 and 1984 aboard corporate planes of a financiallytroubled nursing home business in which he held a $100,000 interest.   The newspaper, citing an unidentified former official of thecompany, Jewell Enterprises, said the practice apparently violatesHouse rules against accepting gifts worth more than $100 fromindividuals with a direct interest in legislation.   Referring to the company's owner, T.R. Jewell, Wright said:``Mr. Jewell gave me a ride but it wasn't on any airplane. He tookme for a ride,'' a reference to the company's eventual bankruptcyand Wright's loss of most of his $100,000 investment.   ``I have absolutely no recollection of ever being on anyairplane I thought was owned by anybody connected with that firm,''Wright said. He declined to answer when asked whether Jewell, anofficial of the Arlington, Texas, bank which loaned Wright themoney to buy into the nursing home venture, had helped him get theloan.   Wright also took issue with testimony at a federal fraud trialin Dallas involving allegations that officials of Commodore SavingsAssociation raised illegal corporate political contributions for a1985 special House election in which Wright took a personalinterest.   On Friday, the institution's former chief financial officer,David Farmer, said he was told Wright would kill legislationopposed by the savings and loan industry in return for $250,000 incampaign contributions.   He testified that he was ``amazed ... that someone as high up asJim Wright would be involved in this.''   Wright denied the allegation and said he does not know Farmer.He invited reporters to go to Fort Worth and interview constituentshe has tried to help. ``You can look until you're blind, ask untilyou're hoarse, listen until you're deaf and you will never findanybody of whom I've asked anything in return,'' he said.   In an announcement, the speaker's office said his legal defenseteam will include Democratic patriarch and former defense secretaryClark Clifford as senior legal and political adviser; Stephen D.Susman of Houston, expected to handle questioning at thedisciplinary hearing; Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., adviser andemissary to House Democrats; Robert Altman, a Washington attorneyand associate of Clifford; and Neal S. Manne, a former counsel tothe Senate Judiciary Committee who is a member of Susman's firm.   Overall legal strategy will continue to be mapped by William C.Oldaker, who has handled the case for Wright thus far, along withco-counsels Lyn Utrecht and Eric Kleinfeld.   Susman's firm represented the Hunt brothers in their efforts toresist collection of $1.5 billion in debt stemming from the Hunts'attempt to corner the world silver market.   Legal bills for the defense team are being paid out of Wright'scampaign funds, a permitted use, said spokesman Mark Johnson.</TEXT></DOC>
