The Americans with Disabilities Act sailed unanimously throughthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Wednesday and isexpected to be approved by the full Senate.   ``This historic legislation will end segregation anddiscrimination against people with disabilities in all aspects ofAmerican society,'' said a statement released jointly byco-sponsors of the measure, Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., TomHarkin, D-Iowa, and David Durenburger, R-Minn.   The measure was hailed by civil rights groups as well as AIDSadvocacy organizations.   Ralph G. Neas, director of the leadership conference on civilrights, a coalition of 180 national organizations, said the bill is``probably the most comprehensive civil rights measure since the1964 Civil Rights Act.   The agreement between President Bush and the senators was ``afair compromise that resulted in a strong and effective bill,'' hesaid.   Disability rights groups have been lobbying for years to givethe nation's estimated 37 million disabled Americans, includingpeople with AIDS, the same civil rights protections as minoritiesand women.   The AIDS Action Council said the measure marked ``a turningpoint in the federal response to the challenges'' of the AIDSepidemic.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush favors allowing``maximum flexibility to implement effective solutions'' andbringing the disabled into the mainstream ``without imposing undueburdens.''   ``The president believes this can be accomplished by usingreasonable measures, phased over time, as this legislation does,''he said. ``The president has pursued a common sense approach,seeking a practical bill that will help the disabled reach theirfull potential.''   The agreement provides for:   _Federal protection for the disabled against job discrimination,paralleling existing protections that apply to organizations thatreceive federal funds. Initially, the new requirement would applyto employers of 25 or more, but eventually it would cover employerswith at least 15 workers.   _A ban on discrimination against the disabled in publicaccommodations, including restaurants, stores and health carefacilities.   _Enforcement of these new civil rights protections through theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission ``and suits seekinginjunctive relief.''   Fitzwater said ``a core group of public accommodations would berequired to make readily achievable alterations to existingfacilities to accommodate the disabled.''   ``This legislation is designed to achieve access for thedisabled in the most efficient manner, with emphasis on making newbuildings accessible,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
