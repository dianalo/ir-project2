 The multimedia computer involves its user in manylevels of interactive decision and control, altering the way information isconveyed.andM;The purpose of multimedia is to improve communication between computer anduser and among users.andP;  Ideas may be expressed in many forms other thanwritten words that are read sequentially.andP;  Image and audio may now beintertwined with the written word and presented interactively to readers.andP;  Inthis sense, multimedia is a new communication tool.andP;  The interactive natureof advanced multimedia presentations gives users control of the presentationand access to desired types of information.andP;  One user may want an overview ofa topic, another may be interested in its financial aspects, and a third usermay be interested in the theory underlying a concept.andP;  Each user may receivewhat is pertinent in a self-determined sequence.andP;  The user is in charge ofthe information flow and is not subject to the predefined ideas of theinformation provider.andM;Although the usefulness of multimedia for graphic artists and musicians isself-evident, consider its use by a mathematician.andP;

 The titleand abstract, but no other portions, of this paper may be copied ordistributed royalty free without further permission by computer-based andother information-service systems.andP;  Permission to republish any other portionof this paper must be obtained from the Editor.andP;  a field of mathematics mayconsist of graphics illustrations of the concept being presented, text, andthe author's voice discussing the subject.andP;  How much more personal would be amathematics text that visually animates the results of a mathematical processthan one that merely describes the results.andP;  In the same way, the ability tohear the actual voice of a person whose biography you are reading and to seethe creative results of that person's lifetime make the educationalexperience more meaningful.andP;  A multimedia document need not be experienced inany predetermined sequence.andP;  Hypertext-like techniques allow a user to perusea document in many directions.andP;  The selection of a word or an image maytrigger the display of additional images and audio to reinforce the subject.andO;Once a path through a document has been completed, the reader may selectanother word or image to continue on the path of discovery or return to thepoint of original departure.andP;  A number of important considerations must betaken into account to make sure that a reader obtains all relevantinformation about a topic, when so many different directions are possible.andO;This possibility was conceived in the mind of Vannevar Bush in 1945,including an imagined implementation using components that were thenavailable.'andM;The Audio Visual Connection systemandM;The Audio Visual Connection&quot;  (AVC [[Trademark]), which is one of the IBMmultimedia program products, is used in this paper to illustrate the processof creating a multimedia presentation.andP;  Storyboard Plus-, LinkWay[Trademark], and InfoWindow [Trademark] are other IBM MUltimedia products.andO;Like them, the AVC is a tool to develop the final application, the multimediapresentation.andP;  The AVC is not itself the end product.andM;The Audio Visual Connection brings the ability to create a complex multimediapresentation within an establishment, eliminating the need for outsideproduction facilities.andP;  Changes to the presentation may similarly beincorporated immediately within the establishment.andP;  The AVC Software may beused with two associated Personal System/2&quot;  PS/2&quot;) hardware adapters, theAudio Capture and Playback Adapter (ACPA) and the Video Capture Adapter(VCA).andP;  The ACPA is used for both audio capture (i.e., the conversion of ananalog signal into digital format for storage in computer memory) andregeneration (i.e., the conversion of a computer-stored digital signal backinto analog format).andP;  The VCA is normally used only for video capture asimages are regenerated on standard PS/2 displays without the need for specialhardware.andP;  An exception occurs when a video output of an AVC presentation isdesired, such as when using the VCA to generate a video output signal forrecording a presentation by a video cassette recorder.andM;The multimedia creation processandM;A multimedia presentation is created in the following three stages: capture,authoring, and presentation.andP;  Capture.andP;  The capture process converts variouselectronic media forms into digital representations of the original media andstores them as computer files.andP;  Examples of these media might include atelevision camera's image of a flower, a scanner's image of a document, amicrophone's audio signal of human speech, and a compact disc's audio outputof a symphony.andP;  The ACPA and VCA adapters and the AVC software perform thisconversion, and accept files created by certain external programs as well.andO;Additional equipment, such as a video camera, video monitor, video cassetterecorder, compact disc player, digital audio tape recorder, microphone, audioamplifier, and speakers complete the multimedia capture system.andM;Technical specialists are required to set up the audio and video captureequipment initially.andP;  Knowledge of the audio and video equipment, lightingtechniques, and methods of recording a noise-free audio signal are essentialfor the successful capture of a multimedia production.andP;  Once the equipmenthas been set up, the capture process may be performed by less experiencedpersonnel.andP;  Authoring.andP;  The authoring process establishes a set of procedurescalled a story that controls the multimedia presentation.andP;  The story definesthe sequence and methods in which the various media formats are displayed orheard, the synchronization between the types of media, and the humaninteraction.andP;  With the AVC, the human interaction capabilities are extensive.andO;For example, the AVC Story might allow control of the presentation by themovement of a cursor on the computer screen.andP;  Another possibility forpresentation control might be the AVC story's evaluation of data entered bythe user in response to a displayed or spoken question to start a complexdatabase search on a remote mainframe.andP;  For a simple presentation, theinteraction may be as straightforward as allowing the user to step throughimages by the touch of a mouse button.andP;  The authoring process provides anediting capability for the computer files that have been created in thecapture process.andP;  Audio files may have click and pop sounds removed or a newphrase may be inserted into a previously recorded speech.andP;  Image files mayhave background objects removed.andP;  Also, parts of one image may be mixed withanother image, or an image may be displayed as a mirror of the original.andO;Text may be overlaid on an image to provide information or pose questions.andO;Drawing tools may produce images created on the computer, from simple boxes,ovals, and graphs to elaborate drawings.andM;The authoring environment requires an ACPA and audio playback equipment(assuming that audio is involved in the presentation), because standard PS/2hardware is used for display.andP;  Successful multimedia presentations requirepreparation and a well thought-out plan.andP;  As with any presentation, properplanning is very important.andP;  Once complete, making minor changes to amultimedia presentation, such as altering price information or replacing animage, requires minimal multimedia skill.andM;Presentation.andP;  The presentation process is the execution of the story, whichcoordinates the multimedia presentation and the interaction with the user.andO;The presentation environment requires an ACPA and audio playback equipment,again assuming that audio is used in the presentation.andP;  If the presentationis made to a large group, a video projection system may be used.andP;  Awell-designed story provides the user with the knowledge and options toexecute the presentation; thus it imposes no special multimedia experiencerequirements on the user.andP;  Multimedia example Consider a department storechain that captures images of its product fines and combines those imageswith spoken and musical overlays to create stories for each department.andP;  Themultimedia presentation is sent to each store of the chain and the storesdistribute specific stories to the various departments.andP;  Customers look atthe products displayed on the screen.andP;  They select specific items on thescreen, then type their names and addresses on the computer keyboard.andP;  Eachcustomer's action initiates the following actions by the store: (1) the orderis sent to the warehouse; (2) the product is moved to the front of the storefor customer pickup; (3) the charge card is billed; (4) the store's inventoryis updated; and (5) the customer's name and address are added to the store'smailing list.andP;  Note that the multimedia presentation need not perform everytask, but it must be able to link into external programs, such as inventorycontrol and charge card billing.andP;  As a variation of the basic procedure,consider the automobile department manager of one store who decides to have asale on tires.andP;  The tire prices are changed in the database at that store anda &quot;Sale&quot; screen is created for that department.andP;  The multimedia presentationfor the automobile department is updated and customers are then made aware ofthe sale.andP;  The update takes but minutes to accomplish by local personnel.andP;  Agiven establishment might have several capture systems, a larger number ofauthoring systems, and many presentation systems.andM;The AVC system configurationandM;Multimedia involves a large amount of data manipulation, which poses demandsupon the processing speed and memory capacity of the computer.andP;  The AVCexecutes on an Intel 80286- machine or larger under Dos 4.0, OperatingSystem/2 [Trademark] (OS/2&quot;) Standard Edition, or OS/2 Extended Edition.andO;Improved performance is achieved under OS/2, due to more efficient memorymanagement.andP;  A Micro Channele PS/2 with 4 megabytes of real memory (RAM) isrequired for capture, and presentation may be performed with either of thebus architectures and about 3 megabytes Of RAM.andP;  Performance may improve withincreased RAM, because less memory swapping is required.andP;  Standard PS/2displays, such as the IBM 8503 monochrome or 8512, 8513, or 8514 colordisplays, may be used, and the IBM 8514/A display adapter may be added toprovide greater color choices and resolution.andM;A typical AVC multimedia presentation requires about one megabyte of storageper presentation minute.andM;This estimate may vary by a factor of two up and down, depending upon thenumber of images and their resolution and upon the amount and fidelity of theaudio.andM;A capture system normally contains both an ACPA audio component and a VCAvideo component, and an authoring or playback system normally contains onlyan audio component.andP;  The Audio Capture and Playback Adapter (ACPA) isavailable in two models: one for Micro Channel machines and the other fornon-Micro Channel machines.andP;  The Video Capture Adapter (VCA) is availableonly for the Micro Channel machines.andP;  Models are available for two standards,one compatible with North American broadcast television and the othercompatible with most European broadcast television.andM;Cooperative processing extends the capability Of AVC.andP;  An IBM Token-RingNetwork is used to connect multiple computers for file sharing.andP;  One computerstores the audio and image files, and the other computers download the filesas required.andP;  A C-language programming interface is provided to allow the AVCeither to be called by another program or to call other programs.andP;  The AVCmay access data stored in the OS/2 Extended Edition database.andP;  For additionalcomputational power, the AVC can communicate with KnowledgeTool [Trademark],the IBM host-based expert system product.andP;  In this case, KnowledgeToolperforms the inference logic using the AVC as a powerful user interface.andM;The Audio Capture and Playback Adapter and audio digital theoryandM;The Audio Capture and Playback Adapter (ACPA) performs both digitization andregeneration of an external audio signal as represented functionally inFigure 1.andP;  The digital signal processor (DSP) is a self-contained processoron the ACPA that is configured to perform data compression, expansion, andother audio processing such as mixing and volume control.andP;  The ACPA has audioinputjacks for both microphone and line; the difference is that themicrophone jack is connected to an amplifier to boost the signal.andP;  The outputof most external audio devices is suitable for the fine input.andP;  A signal froman analog audio source is digitized by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC).andO;The digitized signal is compressed to save storage and is stored in the ACPAshared memory.andP;  The AVC software reads shared memory and stores the audio inPS/2 memory.andP;  The audio editing process is described in the section on AudioVisual Connection software in this paper.andP;  To regenerate the audio, the AVCsoftware sends the digital data to the ACPA shared memory where the data areexpanded.andP;  The data are then converted back to analog by thedigital-to-analog converter (DAC).andP;  The resulting analog signal is sent tooutput jacks for both headphones and line, the only difference being thepower level available at each jack.andP;  The line output is suitable forconnection to most external audio amplifiers.andP;  The ACPA digital signalprocessor (DSP) SOftware is loaded from Ps/2 memory, thus allowing functionalenhancements without changes to the hardware.andP;  The DSP software may bechanged during operation to redefine the functional capabilities of the DSP.andO;What is now a digital audio processor may become a music generator by theloading of new DSP SOftware.andP;  (See the discussion of the Musical InstrumentDigital Interface [MIDI] later in this paper for more on this process.)andM;Audio input.andP;  The analog-to-digital conversion is performed by sampling.andO;Sampling theory  2 shows that an analog signal can be faithfully convertedinto a digital representation if the sampling frequency is twice that of thehighest analog frequency component.andP;  To record the audio spectrum heard bythe human ear, the upper frequency component is about 20 000 Hz (hertz orcycles per second).andP;  To retain this frequency response, a Nyquist samplingrate of twice the upper frequency component of 40  00 samples per second isrequired.andP;  Frequencies greater than 20 000 Hz must be prevented from enteringthe digitization process because they may generate false sampling (aliasing)audio signals.andP;  To accomplish this, a low-pass filter (antialias filter) isused, and a slightly higher sampling rate is used to account for physicallimitations in this filter.andP;  Figure 2 illustrates the sampling process.andP;  Eachsample produces a number that represents the amplitude of the signal at agiven point in time.andP;  An 8-bit sample or quantization divides a signal into256 (that is, 2.sup.8) discrete levels.andP;  By using more bits per sample, alower noise and more accurate representation of the original signal may beobtained.andP;  The Audio Capture and Playback Adapter, like the compact disc,records each of its stereo channels at 44 100 samples per second with 16-bitquantization (that is, [2.sup.16]) to yield 65 536 discrete levels.andP;  Theamplitude of the analog signal is measured every 22.7 microsecond (1/44 100of a second).andP;  The measured amplitude is assigned to one of the 65 536 levelsand is stored as a 2-byte value.andP;  Every second, 44 100 2-byte samples aregenerated for each of the two stereo channels.andP;  That is, data are generatedat a rate of 176 400 bytes per second or 10.5 megabytes of data per minute.andO;Data compression is built into the digital signal processor (DSP) program toreduce the data transmission demand.andP;  Table 1 summarizes the four compressionmodes: hi-fi, stereo, music, and voice.andP;  Compression is achieved bydownsampling (i.e., using every nth sample) and by the use of compressionalgorithms.andP;  A twofold downsampling is performed in most modes, therebyproducing a two-toone compression.andP;  The compression algorithm involvesadaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM), which stores thedifferences between sample values, rather than the actual value of eachsample.andP;  ADPCM achieves a four-to-one compression.andM;Audio output.andP;  To reduce digital-to-analog conversion errors and to simplifythe hardware design, the DSP code uses an oversampling technique, wherebyaudio data from the computer are sampled multiple times to produce 88 200samples per second.andP;  An analog voltage is generated by a digital-to-analogconverter from the value of each digital sample.andP;  This analog voltage ispassed through a digital low-pass filter to remove any high-frequencycomponent and thus produce a smooth output voltage.andP;  MIDI.andP;  The MusicalInstrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a data protocol used extensively inthe electronic music industry.andP;  The ACPA digital signal processor may bereprogrammed by the AVC Software to respond to a MIDl data stream andgenerate its own music.andP;  In this mode, the ACPA may play up to eightconcurrent musical tones from the MIDI data stream, while playing sampledaudio in voice mode.andP;  For example, MIDI mode may play three notes as a pianoand one note each as a string, flute, horn, bass, and drum along with thesampled voice.andP;  MIDI data provide music capability with far less data storagerequirements than sampled music.andP;  MIDI Commands denote musical events such asa NOTE-ON (i.e., the start of a note) or a NOTE-OFF (i.e., the end of a note)but not the actual sound of the music.andP;  Most MIDI commands have parameters.andO;A NOTE-ON COMmand, for example, defines which note is played, its volume, andthe musical device or type of sound being produced.andP;  MIDI ProVides for up to16 musical devices, but only up to eight are used with the ACPA to denote theeight possible concurrent tones.andP;  Figure 3 illustrates the format of aNOTE-ON/OFF command and shows the MIDI data stream for a three-note chordheld for one second.andP;  In MIDI mode, the MIDI sequence requires 18 bytes ofdata plus timing information; in the stereo mode, 22 000 bytes of sampledsound are required.andM;To use MIDI mode, an external MIDI composing program is used to create a songfrom a music keyboard or from the display of a music score on the computerscreen.andP;  Once edited and completed, a computer file of that song is generatedin standard MIDI format, a standardized file format in the electronic musicindustry.andP;  MIDI song files may also be purchased in a completed form frommusic publishers.andM;The AVC accepts this MIDI file as input, allows the selection of musicaltones, configures the ACPA DSP to generate music, and sends the MIDI data tothe DSP for music generation.andM;The Video Capture Adapter and video digital theoryandM;The Video Capture Adapter (VCA) performs both digitization and regenerationof an external video signal.' The VCA responds to four types of video signal:andM;* RGB/Sync-The Red, Green, Blue, Sync mode uses four data paths, one forsynchronization and one each for the primary colors: red, green, and blue.andM;* RGB-The Red, Green, Blue mode uses three data paths where sync is combinedwith the green signal.andM;Because RGB and RGB/Sync modes provide a separate signal for each of theprimary colors, each produces a very high-quality image but requires ahigher-priced camera and monitor than the other modes.andM;* Y/C-The luminance/chrominance mode uses two data paths, one for luminance(Y, the monochrome image) and one for chrominance (C, the color content).andO;Y/C is commonly called Super VHS and is becoming increasingly popular in themarketplace.andP;  Although the output image is lower in quality than RGB, Y/Chardware is less expensive.andM;Composite-The Composite mode combines the entire video signal into one signalbut with a corresponding lower quality and lower cost.andP;  Composite is thesignal produced by the commercial broadcast television industry, consumervideo camera, and video cassette recorder.andM;There are two Video Capture Adapter (VCA) models, one for the NationalTelevision Systems Committee (NTSC) composite signal, which is used in NorthAmerica and Japan, and the other for the Phase Alternating Line (PAL)Composite signal, which is used in much of Europe.andP;  Composite video signalsare interlaced, so that the transmission data rate is halved by refreshingfirst the odd-numbered scan lines and then the even-numbered scan lines.andO;NTSC systems refresh alternate halves of the 525 horizontal line display at60 fields per second, and PAL systems refresh alternate halves of the 625horizontal line display at 50 fields per second.andM;Figure 4 is a functional representation of the VCA.andP;  A signal from an analogvideo source is converted to RGB/Sync, if not originally in that format, anddigitized by the video analog-to-digital converter (ADC).andP;  The resultingimage data are sent to the video digital-to-analog converter (DAC) where theyare converted into the various types of video signals and sent to thevideo-out connectors.andP;  A monitor is attached to the VCA video-out connectorto display the live video from the video source.andP;  When a video image iscaptured, the image is stored in the VCA display memory, and the AVC softwarereads the VCA display memory and stores the image in computer memory.andP;  Thevideo editing process is given in the discussion of AVC software later inthis paper.andM;To generate video, the AVC software sends the digital video data to the VCAdisplay memory, where it is converted back into analog by thedigital-to-analog converter (DAC).andP;  The resulting analog signal is convertedinto the various types of video signals and sent to the video-out connectors.andO;A video cassette recorder can be attached to the video-out connector of theVCA to record the AVC presentation.andM;Video input.andP;  If the input signal is composite video, the luminance andchrominance components are computed to form a Y/C signal.andP;  The luminancesignal, with the sync removed, is mixed with a demodulated form of thechrominance signal to produce RGB.andP;  The sync signal for RGB is found withinthe green signal of the RGB and is separated to form RGB/Sync.andP;  For inputsignal other than composite video, the input is sent to the appropriate pointin this chain.andM;The RGB/Sync signal is sampled by the video analog-to-digital converter (ADC)into three digital signals per pel (i.e., picture element or pixel, which isa single dot of the image).andP;  Each picture element has three six-bitcomponents, for red, green, and blue.andP;  The sampling process is functionallyidentical to audio sampling, except that the video sampling rate isapproximately 12.2 megahertz.andP;  If the input is live composite video, a singlevideo frame may be sampled in 1/30th of a second for NTSC and 1/25th of asecond for PAL.andP;  For the AVC, the three signals are packed into one 16-bitword in the format: 5 bits for red, 6 bits for green, and 5 bits for blue.andO;Each pel can distinguish 65 536 (i.e., 2.sup.16] different hues; thus eachvideo frame requires 614 400 bytes.andM;Video output.andP;  There are three sources for video output: live video, stillvideo captured in the VCA display memory, and still video from the computerstored in the VCA display memory.andP;  In each case, the video is converted toanalog by the video digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the VCA, much as theaudio signal was converted.andP;  Once in analog, the video output image isregenerated in the various formats: RGB/Sync, RGB, Y/C, and composite.andP;  Thisoutput is transmitted to a video device, such as a monitor or video cassetterecorder.andM;Before capture, the three 6-bits/pel of the RGB video-in digital signals passdirectly to the DAC for conversion to analog for display on a monitorconnected to video-out.andP;  The multimedia author views the input video andmakes framing and color balance adjustments, as required.andM;After capture, the video-in image is stored in the display memory as a16-bits/pel RGB stored image.andP;  The monitor connected to video-out now showsthe captured image.andM;During playback, the AVC software may convert the display modes to RGB,output the RGB data to the VCA display memory, and then to video-out.andP;  Theuser can then record the multimedia presentation on a video cassetterecorder.andM;The Audio Visual Connection softwareandM;The AVC software.andP;  Coordinates the multimedia process, providing anintegration of audio and image with the authoring process.andP;  Figure 5 is afunctional representation of the major AVC software components.andM;Library and application editors.andP;  An AVC library is a list of AVC file groupscalled applications, which may be thought of as special-purpose directories.andO;As shown in Figure 5, the library table lists applications (BIRDS, TRAVEL,DEMO) and the application table lists objects, a generic term referring to acomputer file that represents a physical object.andP;  The AVC application editorhandles three types of objects: story, image, and audio.andP;  In this example,the application DEMO has one story file, three image files, and one audiofile.andM;Audio editor.andP;  To record voice, the multimedia author connects a microphoneto the ACPA and talks.andP;  Similarly, to record from a compact disc, the userconnects a compact disc player to the ACPA and plays the compact disc.andP;  Asaudio is recorded, the data are displayed as shown in Figure 6.andP;  Time inseconds is shown under the column headed Play Time, and the small squaresunder the heading Sound indicate audio volume.andP;  The technician adjusts thevolume because, if the volume is too high, the magnitude exceeds the ACPAanalog-to-digital capacity and distortion occurs; if the volume is too low,distortion may occur because few bits are used to represent the signal.andP;  Apoor recording can be redone because the audio file can be deleted as withany computer file.andP;  During recording, the remaining columns are blank.andP;  Afterthe audio has been recorded, the multimedia author has the option ofdisplaying time in 1-second or 0.andP;  1 -second increments.andP;  One or more ofthese time increments of sound can be copied, moved, inserted, and deleted ina manner analogous to a word in a word processor.andP;  If a recording has aclick, the sound increment containing the click may be deleted.andP;  If a speakermispronounces a word, the proper pronunciation may be recorded later andoverlaid on the original recording.andP;  If a speech is too long, portions may bedeleted to bring it within the allotted time.andP;  If there is an audio file ofmusic and one of speech, the two may be mixed to form a new file.andP;  In Figure6, the multimedia author entered the two names in the Sync Label column asvideo synchronization labels to sync video to the audio.andP;  The HORN label isused as an example later in the section on the AVC Software story editor.andO;Audio synchronization may be defined to allow two audio files to be alignedduring playback.andP;  One audio file might contain music while the other containsspeech.andP;  In this way, multiple language versions of a presentation may beproduced by substituting the speech file for one in a different language.andO;The multimedia author uses the fourth column for comments and the remainingcolumns for sound control, as shown.andM;Image digitize.andP;  To capture an image, the multimedia author connects a videocamera and a video monitor to the VCA.andP;  The developer then watches the imagetransmitted to the monitor by the camera, and, with the press of thecomputer's key, snaps the picture when ready.andP;  Once an image has beendigitized by the VCA, it can be stored in one of five modes within thecomputer: RGB, 8514/A, VGA, VGA-8, or MCGA.andP;  Table 2 shows thecharacteristics of the image storage modes.andP;  RGB is the format of theincoming data from the VCA, which may be saved as an image master, because itcontains the maximum resolution and color.andP;  RGB cannot be displayed on a Ps/2screen.andP;  To be used in a multimedia application, RGB MUst be converted to oneof the PS/2 display modes.andP;  The non-RGB modes in Table 2 involve datacompression, where the compression rate varies from image to image.andP;  Thecompressed-storage values shown in Table 2 are typical, but the actualstorage is larger for very complex images and smaller for partial images orimages with large areas of solid color.andP;  The 8514/A mode produces the bestresolution and color, but requires an 8514/A adapter within the PS/2.andP;  Theremaining modes provide tradeoffs among storage requirements, imageresolution, and number of colors.andM;A computer display is limited in the number of distinct colors that can bedisplayed concurrently.andP;  For Ps/2 color displays, up to 256 different colorsmay be displayed concurrently, although the colors selected may come from apossible selection of 65 536.andP;  Because the 16-bit RGB data can produce 65 536(i.e., 216) Colors the AVC must carefully select its colors to produce apleasing rendition of the original image and yet not exceed the color limit.andO;This selected set of colors is known as a palette and is a fundamentalconcern with the display of images.andP;  There are three types of AVC Palette:standard, custom, and fixed.andP;  The task of palette definition is moredifficult when several images are displayed on a screen at one time, becausethe number of colors selected for all the displayed images must still adhereto the 256 color limit.andP;  In addition, one color is set aside as thetransparency color to control the mixing of images and a set of colors isoften reserved for text.andP;  (See the section on the story editor.)andM;A standard palette is a predetermined set of colors that provide a best fitto a wide range of images.andP;  Although seldom optimum for any given image, thestandard palette achieves an excellent rendering of many images and, becauseall images use the same set of colors, multiple images may be displayedconcurrently.andP;  With the AVC, one useful 256 color standard palette iscomposed of 198 colors for image, 56 colors for text, and one color as thetransparency color.andP;  One color is not used.andM;A custom palette is an AVC-selected set of colors for a specific image.andO;Because a custom palette is optimized for each image, an excellent renditionis achieved for almost all images.andP;  One concern exists when multiple imagesare displayed concurrently.andP;  If the number of colors in all the displayedimages exceeds the color limit of the screen, colors in certain images may bechanged.andP;  This color change is called a palette shift and produces incorrectcolors in some of the images.andP;  To avoid a palette shift, the user restrictsthe number of colors available for each image and allows the AVC to select aunique custom palette for each image.andP;  One useful 256 color custom paletteallows two images to be concurrently displayed with 99 colors per image plus56 colors for text, and one color as the transparency color.andP;  A fixed paletteis similar to a custom palette except that the multimedia developer may exertcontrol over the selection of colors for an image.andP;  To achieve the bestpossible rendering of an image, a developer may initially use the AVC toselect either a standard or custom palette, convert this palette to a fixedpalette, and then hand-select certain colors.andP;

 Triggerfields denote an area of thescreen that, when selected by the user, cause the AVC Story to perform aspecific task.andP;  For example, a real-estate application screen may show theimages of nine homes with each home defined as a trigger field.andP;  A user who Astandard palette is a predetermined set of colors that provide a best fit toa wide range of images.andP;  Although seldom optimum for any given image, thestandard palette achieves an excellent rendering of many images and, becauseall images use the same set of colors, multiple images may be displayedconcurrently.andP;  With the AVC, one useful 256 color standard palette iscomposed of 198 colors for image, 56 colors for text, and one color as thetransparency color.andP;  One color is not used.andM;A custom palette is an AVC-selected set of colors for a specific image.andO;Because a custom palette is optimized for each image, an excellent renditionis achieved for almost all images.andP;  One concern exists when multiple imagesare displayed concurrently.andP;  If the number of colors in all the displayedimages exceeds the color limit of the screen, colors in certain images may bechanged.andP;  This color change is called a palette shift and produces incorrectcolors in some of the images.andP;  To avoid a palette shift, the user restrictsthe number of colors available for each image and allows the AVC tO select aunique custom palette for each image.andP;  One useful 256 color custom paletteallows two images to be concurrently displayed with 99 colors per image plus56 colors for text, and one color as the transparency color.andP;  A fixed paletteis similar to a custom palette except that the multimedia developer may exertcontrol over the selection of colors for an image.andP;  To achieve the bestpossible rendering of an image, a developer may initially use the AVC toselect either a standard or custom palette, convert this palette to a fixedpalette, and then hand-select certain colors.andP;

 For example, a real-estateapplication screen may show the images of nine homes with each home definedas a trigger field.andP;  A user who wants more information on one of the homesmoves the cursor to where the image of the desired house is located.andP;  Thestory detects that a specific trigger field is selected and initiates furtherdisplays of the interior of the home, overlays current price and purchasingdata, and plays an audio file describing the attributes of the home.andP;  Themultimedia developer can use an almost unlimited number of trigger fieldsthroughout the presentation, thereby giving the user a hypertext-likecapability.andM;Datafields denote area of the screen where the user may enter data or the AVCmay display data.andP;  For example, a self-teaching application may pose aquestion.andP;  The user enters an answer in a data field of the screen.andP;  The AVCreads the answer and responds accordingly.andM;Story editor.andP;  The AVC story is written in the audio visual authoring (AVA)language,' which is a variation Of REXX, the IBM procedural language forSystems Application Architecture&quot; (SAA-).andP;  Figure 7 is an example of a story.andO;The AVA Statement column lists the AVA command and the file that it affects.andO;The PLAY command plays an audio file.andP;  The example uses the audio sync labelHORN of Figure 6.andP;  The SHOW command displays one image while the PASTEcommand displays a second image over the first image.andP;  MOST AVA commands haveparameters such as those that define the type of transition between images(e.g., fade, explode, dissolve), the part of an image to be displayed (inpercent of screen), the speed at which a command is to be processed, and thetime or condition at which to continue on to the next command.andP;  Standarddecision logic (e.g., IF, THEN, ELSE, DO, WHILE), mathematical calculations(e.g., ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, MAXIMUM, MINIMUM), and filemanagement (e.g., LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN) are available.andP;  Following is theexplanation of the AVC StOry editor screen shown in Figure 7.andM;* Line 1.andP;  Start audio Of SONGI, fade volume in from silence to 100 percentin 1 second, go to line 2 immediately.andM;* Line 2.andP;  Display partial image of FLOWER1 by exploding image outwardhorizontally in 1.4 seconds, wait 0.4 seconds until going to fine 3.andP;  Partialimage is 0 percent to 30 percent of horizontal image and 0 percent to 20percent of vertical image positioned at the top-left comer  O percent, 0percent) of screen.andM;* Line 3.andP;  Display partial image Of FLOWER1 by exploding image outwardhorizontally in 1.4 seconds, wait until any key or mouse button is depressedbefore going to line 4.andP;  The same partial image of line 2  O percent to 30percent horizontal, 0 percent to 20 percent vertical) is displayed below thefirst image  0 percent horizontal, 20 percent vertical).andM;* Line 4.andP;  Start audio of SONG2, volume is immediately at 100 percent, go toline 5 immediately.andM;* Line 5.andP;  Display full image Of CLOUDS by fading in with a checkerboardpattern in 0.5 seconds, wait until SONG2 audio sync label, HORN, is reachedbefore continuing with line 6.andM;* Line 6.andP;  Display image Of BIRDS only where this image is not thetransparency color.andP;  The screen now shows an image of birds superimposed onthe image of the clouds.andM;* Line 7.andP;  Fade CLOUDS/BIRDS image to a blue screen in 2 seconds when theSONG2 audio sync label, END, is reached.andM;Two methods may be used to produce animation.andP;  The first method impliesmotion by such a mechanism as that of gradually displaying an arrow from itstail to its head in several seconds or successively redisplaying the image ofa bird across the screen.andM;The second method rapidly displays a series of overlapping partial imagesresulting in a motion picture effect.andM;Figure 8 illustrates a picture of an imaginary product that was created usingseveral AVC techniques.andP;  Refer to the sidebar for a description of how theAVC was used to create this image.andP;  Do not believe the old adage that thecamera does not lie; it can be made to lie !andP;  Concluding remarksandM;Multimedia offers computer users new and expanded opportunities toparticipate in the learning experience.andP;  As with any medium, the quality ofthe data is of utmost importance.andP;  Useless information, no matter howattractively presented, is still useless information.andP;  The multimedia authormust ensure that a presentation is pertinent to the needs and level ofunderstanding of the user, and the information must be accurate andup-to-date.andP;  Multimedia provides a tool to improve communication.andP;  As with aconventional presentation, the multimedia author retains responsibility forthe actual quality of that communication.andM;Just as text written by others may not be used without permission (andpossibly payment), images and audio produced by others must be given the samerespect.andP;  Generally speaking, any audio or image in a copyrighted form (e.g.,andO;record, compact disc, magazine, television) may not be used withoutpermission.andP;  Multimedia authors should inform themselves of sources ofpermission (e.g., American Society of Composers and Publishers [ASCAP]) andlegal requirements for obtaining permission, acknowledgment, and payment.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;Early investigation of audio and video concepts by Glenn Henry paved the waytoward the development of many of the principles described in this paper.andO;Actual product development of the Audio Visual Connection was led by BradBeitel and Wayne Galella, and the quality of the product is a directreflection of their teams of people.andP;
