As a result, TMOC Resources Ltd., a natural resources company based in Melbourne, Australia, is now Avalon's principal shareholder. At the end of January, Avalon had 12.1 million common shares outstanding. The company wouldn't elaborate.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Avalon closed at $5.50, up 50 cents.    Avalon said three directors who were Deltec's representatives on its board have resigned, along with three other directors. The company declined to give a reason for the resignations.    Avalon elected two new directors: Benjamin W. Macdonald, a TMOC director, and Hardwick Simmons, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Avalon said its board now has five directors, down from nine. </TEXT></DOC>
