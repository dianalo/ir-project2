In a surprising if not fatal setback for promoters of apolicy overhaul, the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee yesterday agreed to send a water bill written bySen. John Seymour (R., Calif.) to the full Senate, accordingto environmental lobbyists.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Seymour's bill is the mildest of several proposalsthe committee had been considering that would change the waythe federal Bureau of Reclamation operates the Central ValleyProject, a sprawling system of dams and canals that funnelstaxpayer-subsidized water to California farmers.   The project is under attack because its operations havedamaged a lot of wildlife habitat and imperiled some fish andbird species along California waterways. Moreover, manycritics say giving the farmers heavily subsidized water is nolonger sound policy in the arid and increasingly urban West.   Sen. Seymour's bill would authorize farmers to sell theirfederal water to cities and other users and would increasethe amount of federal water dedicated to wildlife refuges andfish runs.   However, the bill, which is supported by agribusinessinterests, wouldn't affect the water subsidies that farmerscurrently receive, which total about $400 million a year. Itis far less drastic than proposals pushed by committeeChairman Bennett Johnston (D., La.) and Sen. Bill Bradley(D., N.J.). Their proposals would have severely chopped thefarmers' subsidies and required five times as much water forenvironmental purposes as Sen. Seymour's proposals do.   The committee's decision followed the collapse ofnegotiations between Sen. Seymour and Sens. Bradley andJohnston. Sen. Seymour had threatened a filibuster if theBradley and Johnston proposals emerged from the committee.The move also followed heavy lobbying by agribusinessinterests and officials of the administration of California'sRepublican governor, Pete Wilson, who met with top Bushadministration officials including White House chief of staffSamuel Skinner.   The water fight is far from over. Proponents of tougheraction said that getting any bill out of the committee couldbe called progress; for the past three years, opponents ofchanging the Central Valley Project managed to prevent anybills from reaching the Senate floor.   Neither Sen. Seymour, Sen. Bradley nor Sen. Johnston couldbe reached last night for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
