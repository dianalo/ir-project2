The seven executives, all of whom are corporate officers or topmanagers from RJR subsidiaries, will join KKR founding partner HenryKravis, KKR partner Paul E. Raether and acting Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer J. Paul Sticht on the committee, which is chargedwith overseeing all policy, strategic planning and administration ofthe food and tobacco conglomerate.   Also Thursday, a federal judge in New York refused to grant apreliminary injunction that would have blocked Kohlberg Kravis'takeover of RJR Nabisco, as requested by Metropolitan Life InsuranceCo. and Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Co.   U.S. District Judge John Walker said the insurance companies,which own RJR Nabisco bonds, had not proved they would beirreparably harmed by the takeover. Irreparable harm must be provedbefore a preliminary injunction can be handed down.   Walker said he was allowing the case to proceed to trial. Theinsurance companies have filed suit against the transaction on theground it has unfairly depressed the price of their RJR Nabiscobonds.   In announcing the appointments, Sticht said, ``We have broughttogether the senior operating executives of the corporation withsenior corporate management to ensure our continued leadership inthe businesses we serve.''   ``At the same time, we are aggressively seeking our new chiefexecutive officer, a process we hope to have completed within thenext several months,'' he said.   Former Chairman F. Ross Johnson resigned from the Atlanta-basedcompany after his own takeover bid was rejected by RJR's board ofdirectors in favor of KKR's $109-a-share cash and securities offer.   Earlier this week, Edward A. Horrigan Jr., who had joined withJohnson in the attempted buyout, resigned as chairman and chiefexecutive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., signaling hisfailure to land the top job.   Those named to the committee Thursday were:   Harold L. Henderson, RJR Nabisco executive vice president andgeneral counsel; Edward J. Robinson, RJR Nabisco's executive vicepresident, finance and chief financial officer; Ralph Angiuoli,president and CEO of the company's domestic tobacco operations;Robert J.
