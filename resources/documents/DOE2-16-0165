The objective of this study was to compare theperformance characteristics of one of these airfoil families to othercommonly used airfoil series for a typical three-bladed, stall-regulatedHAWT. The traditional airfoil series chosen for comparison with SERI'snew thin airfoil family were the NACA 23XXX, NACA 44XX, and NASA LS(1).The Micon 110 wind turbine was chosen because it is a typical three-bladed,stall-regulated rigid rotor system. The performance characteristics ofthe different airfoil series were derived analytically using the Epplerairfoil design code in the analysis mode. On a relative basis, this approachto comparing airfoils was considered more accurate than using airfoilperformance characteristics based on wind-tunnel test data. After generatingthe performance characteristics for each airfoil series, the subsequentrotor performance and blade loads were calculated using SERI's PROPSHcomputer code. Resulting annual energy output, which is dependent onthe wind-speed distribution, was calculated using SERI's Systems Engineeringand Analysis Computer Code (SEACC). The results of the study show thatfixed-wing airfoils generally result in excessive peak power for stallregulated, rigid rotors. By operating the wind turbine at a less desirableblade pitch angle, peak power can be reduced at the expense of highermean blade loads and lower annual energy output. In contrast, the thinairfoil family was designed to reduce peak power at optimum blade pitchto minimize blade loads and maximize annual energy output. 7 refs., 12figs.</TEXT></DOC>
