Bush got his way last week, as Senate authors Carl Levin,D-Mich. and Warren Rudman, R-N.H. made last-minute changes to makesure the lobbying restrictions leave out presidents.   The restrictions, including the first application to formermembers of Congress, were approved early Saturday as part of thelegislation to raise pay of lawmakers, judges and top executivebranch officials.   A House source, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity, said,``It's the White House that's been yelling `parity, parity,parity''' to make sure that top officials in all three governmentbranches were covered when they left government. ``That meant`cover everybody else but me,''' the source said, referring to Bush.   But White House spokesman Stephen Hart said the administrationhad good reason to seek the exclusion for presidents. The bill mayhave prevented ``a current president from consulting with a pastpresident,'' he said.   ``We felt the president should be removed because of his uniquestatus,'' said Hart. ``The president wouldn't be able to talk toanybody in the government ... His work involves the entiregovernment. It's in the national interest for a sitting presidentto be able to consult past presidents.''   Hart said there's never been an example of a president lobbyingthe government after leaving office, adding ``the notion that itwould occur is somewhat demeaning to the presidency.''   He noted ex-vice presidents are covered by the restrictions, andshould be because many have entered private business.   Current anti-lobbying language is silent on presidentialcoverage, but presidents are considered excluded under a JusticeDepartment ruling.   ``In every version until the last one, the intention was tocover the president. We exempted the president at the White House'srequest,'' said Robert Stevenson, Rudman's spokesman.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the prime author of lobbyingrestrictions in the House, called the Bush administration'sposition ``inconsistent.''   Bush, he said, ``lobbied so hard to make (the restrictions)tougher. The president wanted a provision that people couldn't evenlobby for free.''   Frank said he reluctantly accepted the president's request whenthe pay and ethics package reached the House because, ``We couldn'tnegotiate everything.''   Provisions of the new legislation, some similar to current lawand some going beyond it, would:   _Impose a lifetime ban on lobbying on matters where formerofficials were ``personally and substantially involved.''   _Require a two-year ban on former officials lobbying on mattersthat were under their supervision, even if they had not directlyparticipated.   _Prohibit lobbying for a year by those personally andsubstantially involved in any trade or treaty negotiation.   _Impose a one-year ban on top senior executives from lobbyingtheir former agency on any matter in which the ex-officials wouldseek official action.   _Bar any former top official, for one year, from representing,aiding or advising a foreign government or foreign political partyin a matter before any department or agency.</TEXT></DOC>
