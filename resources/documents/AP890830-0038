(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alabama is banning hazardous wasteshipments from 22 states and the District of Columbia to keep thestate ``from becoming the waste dump of the nation,'' Gov. Guy Huntsaid.   A representative of the hazardous waste industry said his groupplans to challenge the ban _ the second of its type in the country _in court.   On Tuesday, the Alabama Department of Environmental Managementidentified states that would be affected by a law enacted in May. Itbars states from sending hazardous waste to Alabama if they don'thave some means of disposal within their own borders or if theydon't have a cooperative agreement with Alabama.   ``The intent of this legislation was to force states to acceptresponsibility for the hazardous waste they generate. In the past,it has seemed Alabama was the path of least responsibility,'' saidSue Robertson, chief of the department's land division.   Alabama's ban is similar to one enacted earlier this year bySouth Carolina.   Tucker Eskew, an aide to South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell,applauded the move and said the two states are aiming for ``aregional approach which ensures reciprocity and fair burdensharing'' in waste disposal.   Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous WasteTreatment Council in Washington, said the lobbying group has madeoverturning the two states' laws a top priority. He said the statelaws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will cause ashortage of hazardous waste sites nationally.   ``It is virtually certain we will challenge one. The onlyquestion is whether we will challenge both,'' he said.   Mrs. Robertson said Alabama's ban would affect only the hazardouswaste landfill at Emelle, the nation's largest. The law leaves it upto the landfill operator, Chemical Waste Management, to stopshipments from the banned states, she said.   Chemical Waste spokesman Chris Grimshawe said the company isstudying the list of states and will decide later whether to takelegal action.   According to figures compiled by state environmental officials,Alabama ranks fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it collectsfrom other states, and second in net intake, which deducts wasteshipped out of the state. Indiana ranks first in both categories.   Mrs. Robertson predicted the ban could reduce Emelle's waste by50,000 to 100,000 tons for the rest of the year. Without the ban,the department had predicted that the landfill would receive 700,000tons of waste this year, up from 550,000 tons last year.   Officials from Alabama and seven other Southeastern states willmeet Thursday in Atlanta to discuss ways to dispose of hazardouswastes over the next 20 years. Mrs. Robertson said the ban ``couldbe used as a negotiating tool'' to get the other states to handletheir share of waste.   South Carolina is the only other Southeast state with a hazardouswaste landfill.   Eighteen of the banned states and the District of Columbia haveno disposal facilities. They are Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida,Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, NewMexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont,Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.   Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington were banned because theydid not respond to the state's request for information abouthazardous waste disposal within their borders.</TEXT></DOC>
