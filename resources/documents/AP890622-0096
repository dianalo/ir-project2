The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled againstHarte-Hanks because of a 1983 article in the Hamilton, Ohio,Journal-News. But the decision also said the appeals court issued amisleading opinion about the standards of reporting andinvestigation by the media.   The lawsuit against Harte-Hanks, which formerly published theHamilton newspaper, was filed by Daniel Connaughton, a Hamiltonlawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a1983 election against incumbent James N. Dolan.   A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the Journal-News said one of the womenwho offered testimony before a grand jury investigating allegedcorruption in the municipal court system ``claims Dan Connaughtonoffered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida `inappreciation' for their help'' in the investigation which heinstigated.   The article quoted the woman as saying she thought Connaughtonused ``dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with hisinvestigiation of Billy New, the court's chief administrativeofficer.   The woman who was quoted in the article, and was its only source,was one of seven people who had attended a meeting with Connaughtonwhen the offer allegedly was made. The others who attended deniedthat any offer of jobs or a Florida trip was made.   Connaughton sued Harte-Hanks three months after he lost theelection. A federal jury awarded him $5,000 in compensatory damagesand $195,000 in punitive damages.   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ``Theevidence in this case, when reviewed in its entirety, isunmistakably sufficient to support a finding of actual malice.''   Despite that, the decision today adhered to a 1984 ruling inwhich the nation's highest court said appellate courts mustsecond-guess juries that rule for public officials and publicfigures in libel suits against news media defendants.   In that 1984 decision, Bose vs. Consumers Union, the justicessaid appeals courts have broad authority _ and a constitutionallyrequired obligation _ to review jury verdicts that favor publicofficials and public figures who sue for libel.   To win such a suit, a public official or public figure must provethe allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with``actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.   According to the record in today's case, Connaughton filed aprivate criminal complaint about five weeks before the election withHamilton police based on corruption allegations against New, theadministrative officer.   Connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paidbribes to New to ``fix'' cases, and that one of the women said someof the transactions occurred in Dolan's presence.   New eventually was convicted of bribery. Dolan was not indicted.   But Connaughton's campaign contended that Dolan bore the ultimateresponsibility for ``any failure to manage the court or itsemployees.''   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld theaward last year, rejecting Harte-Hanks' arguments that the 1984Supreme Court decision required a reversal of the jury verdict.   The appeals court said the 1984 call for independent appellatereview does not apply to a case's facts but instead ``was limited toa review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof ofactual malice.''   Today, the justices said the 6th Circuit court's language wasmisleading.   The appeals court opinion could appear to mean that a newspaperfaces liability if it strays from ``the standards of investigationand reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers,''Stevens said, but that is not the same as `actual malice.'   Harte-Hanks has since sold the Journal-News. Its new owner isDean Singleton.   The case is Harte-Hanks vs. Connaughton, 88-10.</TEXT></DOC>
