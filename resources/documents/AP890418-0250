The nation that makes the world's fastest computers has aspecial claim to world leadership in high technology. For years,that nation has been the United States. In a decade or so, it maywell be Japan.   Two events a week apart show how quickly Japan is moving tosurpass the United States in supercomputing:   _Last Monday, Japan's NEC Corp. announced it will come out nextyear with a family of supercomputers faster than the machines thatwill be released about the same time by Cray Research Inc., theMinneapolis-based world leader.   _This Monday, Control Data Corp. said it was folding ETASystems, the supercomputer operation that lost more than $100million last year.   Once again, Japanese companies are mounting a single-mindedcampaign to achieve superiority in a field traditionally dominatedby Americans. And once again, their long-term focus is paying off.   ``They have a one-track mind. They want to build the best sothey find ways of doing it,'' said Sidney Fernbach, a consultantand retired director of computer operations at Lawrence LivermoreNational Laboratory.   Fernbach oversaw supercomputers at Lawrence Livermore that wereused for designing nuclear weapons and experimenting with nuclearfusion. Now he chairs a supercomputing committee for the Instituteof Electrical and Electronics Engineers.   ``I have no optimistic things to say about the U.S.supercomputer industry. I am just horrified,'' he said in aninterview.   Disaster for U.S. supercomputing is not imminent. Cray continuesto control about two-thirds of the world market, by one measure.Hundreds of programs have been written to run on Cray machines, andthat software will keep customers coming back.   Moreover, Cray's total reliance on supercomputers for a livingkeeps the company sharply focused on its mission.   ``Cray has done a lot of things very, very right,'' said MichaelP. Burwen, president of the Palo Alto Management Group consultingfirm.   Otherwise, though, most signs are pointing the wrong way.   _Japan's big three (NEC, Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd.) arevertically integrated, meaning they make everything needed for asupercomputer from microchips on up. They can tailor chips to theirown needs. Cray, in contrast, relies on its competitor Fujitsu forhigh-speed logic chips.   _Japan makes much faster single processors, forcing Cray andother U.S. companies to compete by lashing together many processors(for Cray, eventually 64). Making that many work together on aproblem is diabolically difficult.   _With the help of Americans, Japanese companies are catching upin their one weak area, software. The Houston Area ResearchConsortium has become a software bonanza for NEC since theconsortium agreed to buy the only Japanese-made supercomputer inthe United States. The trend is sure to continue as softwaredevelopers adapt their programs for Japanese machines.   What should be done? The federal government, the world's biggestpurchaser of supercomputers, already has a buy-American policy,although procurement rules inhibit potentially fruitful cooperationbetween buyers and sellers.   The National Science Foundation backs a network of supercomputercenters, but it is aimed more at using the machines than designingbetter ones.   It is not clear how much good an industry-government researchpartnership like Japan's 10-year project would do. Fernbach favorsit, while Burwen argues that in Japan, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsucompete so intensely with each other that they never contributedtheir best work.   Fernbach favors cultivating new U.S. supercomputer producers byhaving government agencies in effect promise to buy their firstmachines.   Besides Cray and ETA, Thinking Machines Corp. of Cambridge,Mass., has sold some supercomputers, and others are expected fromEvans andamp; Sutherland Computer Co. and Amdahl Corp. (whose largestshareholder is Fujitsu).   The Japanese most fear International Business Machines Corp.,which leads in unit sales of supercomputers if its speciallyequipped mainframes are counted. IBM is the only company that, likethe Japanese, is vertically intgrated from chips on up.   IBM is supporting the start-up Supercomputer Systems Inc., whichwas founded by former Cray designer Steve Chen. It also is workingwith Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop a powerful newsupercomputer.   Still, Fernbach, for one, is pessimistic. ``I think the Japaneseare going to steal the whole computer business away from us,'' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday April 19</NOTE></DOC>
