<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0134 </DOCNO><TEXT>As a part of the certification procedure of the Aerotech 23PI250 windturbine of Newinco, the turbine has been tested at the wind turbine teststation of ECN at Petten (Netherlands Energy Research Centre). In thisdocument the measurement of the power curve is described. The appliedmeasurement and evaluation method was in close agreement with the IEA(International Energy Agency) recommendations for wind turbine powerperformance determination. From the results of the measurements it canbe concluded that the turbine starts producing electrical power at a10 minute averaged wind speed of 5 m/s. At a 10 minute averaged windspeed of 15 m/s the power is about 220 kW. At higher wind speeds theturbine stops automatically due to wind gusts. With the measured powercurve the potential annual energy production has been calculated. Theresults of this indicate that the potential energy production of theturbine is relatively good. 5 figs., 6 refs., 1 tab., 1 app.</TEXT></DOC>
