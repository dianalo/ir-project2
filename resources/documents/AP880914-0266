Officials said the plan would create a profit-sharing pool whenthe company's U.S. operations exceed a return of 6 percent onassets. They said employees would share 17 percent of profits abovethis threshold.   Alcoa officials said individual payouts will vary with profitsand the number of employees involved. The plan is retroactive toJan. 1, the company said.   Alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of eachemployee's base salary if second-half 1988 profits equal first-halfprofits.   In contract negotiations three weeks ago, the company offered aprofit-sharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to$1,300 for blue-collar workers, based on Alcoa's expected 1988profits.   The United Steelworkers of America union said it rejected theplan as inadequate and said it opposed the company's plan to extendit to salaried, white-collar workers.   On Aug. 24, the USW and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workersunions broke off early negotiations with Alcoa after rejectingoffers that included profit-sharing, an immediate ratificationbonus, annual lump sum bonuses, an improved medical insuranceoption and increased pension benefits.   USW negotiator George Becker said the talks ended because Alcoa``would not address several key issues,'' including wage andpension increases.   The unions sought new contracts to recover concessionsnegotiated in 1986, when the aluminum industry faced difficulteconomic times.</TEXT></DOC>
