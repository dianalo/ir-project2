Defense attorney Richard Beckler said the government's plan toadjust but not drop a broad conspiracy charge ``doesn't make anysense,'' but the judge said it depends on the specifics of theprosecution motion, which won't be submitted until next week.   Beckler said he wants to subpoena Reagan and Bush becausePoindexter ``had substantial contact with both of these individualsthroughout this offense as outlined in the indictment.''   Associate independent counsel Christian Mixter told U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Harold Greene that after the charges are narrowed``there would be no reason to involve'' Bush and Reagan in the trial.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said the prosecution will seekdismissal of theft and wire fraud charges, which deal with thediversion of Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, andportions of the broad conspiracy charge against Poindexter.   Later in the day, Walsh filed a motion to dismiss the threecharges against arms dealer Richard V. Secord, who is scheduled tobe tried separately in November.   In court papers, Walsh said he wished to avoid the same legalfight over state secrets that loomed in the Poindexter case,particularly because of the reluctance of federal agencies to giveSecord access to classified documents to prepare his defense.   Secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuityto former White House aide Oliver L. North by arranging to set up a$200,000 Swiss bank account for his children and by financinginstallation of a $13,800 security system outside North's suburbanVirginia home.   He also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional hearingson the Iran-Contra affair.   The move to drop the major Iran-Contra charges against Secordforeshadows the ultimate dismissal of those counts against hisformer business partner, Albert Hakim, who is also awaiting trial.   After the Poindexter hearing, Walsh indicated outside thecourtroom that the government's motion would seek to preserveportions of a wide-ranging conspiracy charge dealing withobstruction of Congress. Thus, the government appears prepared toscuttle the portion of the 38-page conspiracy count dealing with thediversion of profits to the Contras.   Walsh said he is trying to avoid the kind of protracted battleover classified material that threatened to derail the prosecutionof North.   North, a former Poindexter aide, was convicted of three feloniesin the Iran-Contra affair and faces sentencing next Friday.   He tried unsuccessfully to require Reagan and Bush to testify athis trial. U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashedsubpoenas for both men. Gesell said that the trial record containedno proof North received authorization from Reagan to engage inillegal conduct, and that North failed to demonstrate that Bush, whowas Reagan's vice president, had any relevant information.   However, Poindexter, unlike North, met daily with Reagan, and somay have more solid legal grounds for asking the former president totestify.   Walsh said that if he attempts to prosecute the charges againstPoindexter in their entirety, Greene might rule that vast amounts ofnow-classified material might be required at the trial.   Objections by U.S. intelligence agencies to introducing suchmaterial led to scuttling of the entire conspiracy charge as well asthe theft charge against North.   Beckler expressed concern to Greene that Walsh isn't planning toseek dismissal of the entire conspiracy charge against Poindexter.   The lawyer suggested that Walsh ``thinks he may be solving''problems but that his move ``doesn't make any sense.''   Greene responded that if Walsh decides to drop 5 percent of theconspiracy count, then ``we have a big problem'' concerning the useof classified information. But if Walsh seeks dismissal of 95percent of that count, there won't be a big problem, the judge added.   The remaining four counts against Poindexter accuse him ofobstructing and making false statements to Congress in connectionwith North's secret resupply operation for the Contras and a 1985arms shipment to Iran.   Greene didn't set a trial date but did say he wanted to avoidNovember and December when Secord may go on trial.</TEXT></DOC>
