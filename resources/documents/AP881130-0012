(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Customs officials have seized records andelectronic equipment from an import-export firm that allegedly madean illegal agreement to ship military equipment to Iran, accordingto court papers.   The U.S. Customs Service, in papers filed in U.S. District Court,said Aero Marketing Inc. had agreed with an undercover customs agentto ship $1.8 million in ``military, electronic and communicationsequipment'' to Iran this year.   Federal law bans the sale of many of the items to that country,according to the affidavit.   Aero Marketing, based in Virginia's Fairfax County, was beinginvestigated as part of a ``sting'' operation centered in New York,where an undercover customs agent was posing as an exporter, customsofficials said.   No criminal charges have been filed against the company or itsofficers, but a customs official said the investigation wascontinuing.   According to court documents, the Customs Service searched AeroMarketing's office on Nov. 8 and a warehouse it rents on Nov. 14 andseized unspecified goods and electronic gear.   Derrick Manteau, a vice president of Aero Services, wasidentified in the affidavit as having arranged the equipment sale.None of the equipment reached Iran, the affidavit said.   Manteau declined to comment on the allegations Tuesday, saying,``Our lawyer tells us it's not something we should be discussing atthis time.''   According to the affidavit, the undercover customs agent firstasked Manteau to ship 10 sophisticated radios to South Africa, atransaction that would violate federal law. The radios were sent toFrankfurt, where the Customs Service took possession of them.   The agent then arranged the $1.8 million Iranian shipment, andabout $3,000 in equipment was shipped in August as a test and waspicked up by the Customs Service in Geneva, the affidavit said.</TEXT></DOC>
