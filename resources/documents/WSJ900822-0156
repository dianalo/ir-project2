The severity of the reduction in so-called affiliatecompensation was unexpected, given the past five years ofprime-time dominance by National Broadcasting Co., a GeneralElectric Co. unit and the most profitable network by far. &quot;Weexpected a reduction of about 5%,&quot; said Eric Bremner,president of the NBC affiliate board.</LP><TEXT>   The cuts are to begin in January 1991 and are a result ofthe network's continuing shortfall in delivering the keydemographic group of viewers ages 18 to 49, a primary targetfor advertisers. Moreover, some broadcast executives predictthe cuts could be increased if NBC's ratings decline furtherwhen the new television season starts in mid-September.   NBC has said it faces a $200 million shortfall inprojected ad revenue because of declining ratings this year.In March, NBC added about 14 30-second commercials in primetime to compensate advertisers for failing to deliver as manyviewers as the network had guaranteed.   NBC pays about $146 million annually to its affiliatedstations in return for their airing network shows andproviding NBC with a national audience that can be sold toadvertisers. The compensation system dates back more than 50years and began with radio.   Compensation has been a key element -- and in recent yearsa major point of dissension -- in the network-affiliaterelationship. For instance, when a local station contemplatesswitching network affiliation, the threatened network willgenerally increase the compensation payment as incentive toforgo the switch.   Some NBC affiliates will see decreases of 15%. NBCwouldn't elaborate.   According to Mr. Bremner of the affiliate board, NBCwanted to eliminate compensation entirely about two yearsago. But NBC met resistance from the affiliates and laterdevised a formula to determine the amount of compensation tobe paid. The amount of compensation was to be based on theaverage for the network's ratings performance duringFebruary, May and November.   NBC's ratings declined 3% in November, dropped 2% inFebruary -- and plunged a surprising 25% in May. &quot;The networkadmitted it screwed up&quot; by airing too many repeats ofprime-time shows, Mr. Bremner said. The overall decline inNBC's prime-time ratings for the three months came to 10%,and so affiliates' compensation will fall by a like amount.   &quot;Compensation is still a vital part of thenetwork-affiliate partnership,&quot; said John Damiano, NBC'ssenior vice president of affiliate relations, who confirmedthe plan to roll back affiliate payments, &quot;and we see it asan investment.&quot;   Mr. Damiano said compensation had increased annually until1989 and that &quot;some stations could actually be in for anincrease, although they'll be the exception.&quot;   To make up for lost revenue from NBC, some affiliatesmight forgo airing some NBC programs in favor of syndicatedshows that let the stations keep more of the advertisingrevenue instead of having to share spots with NBC. Forexample, KYW, the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia, won'tbroadcast &quot;Hull Street High,&quot; a new NBC series airing Sundaysat 7 p.m., and will instead air syndicated repeats of &quot;21Jump Street.&quot;   &quot;Pre-emptions are a danger here,&quot; said Mr. Bremner, &quot;and Iregret it. It hurts the whole network-affiliaterelationship.&quot;   Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s television network, now No. 2and gaining on NBC in prime time, particularly among youngadults, isn't planning to reduce or change its compensationpayments.   Nor is CBS Inc.'s network, in third place, reducingcompensation. But CBS is asking its affiliates to broadcastits two-hour morning news program and its lacklusterlate-night programming if the stations are to avoid adecrease in the annual payments.</TEXT></DOC>
