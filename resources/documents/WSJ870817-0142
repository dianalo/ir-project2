The government reported scores of new strikes Friday, but it appeared to tilt further toward support for the workers' demands.    Securities analysts said that the combined earnings of 250 companies listed on the Korean Stock Exchange increased 69% in the first half from a year earlier, to 541.9 billion won ($677.4 million). Combined sales rose 18%, to 3.33 trillion won ($4.17 billion).    Among companies posting sizable gains were many that have been dogged by strikes and sit-ins since the labor unrest erupted three weeks ago. Goldstar Co., the flagship of the Lucky-Goldstar group, posted an 89% profit jump, to 15.3 billion won, and a 25% sales increase, to 966.4 billion won. Reacting to the higher earnings, a spokesman for striking Goldstar workers said there wasn't any excuse for why the workers &quot;are still so underpaid.&quot; Goldstar officials declined to comment on the labor problems.    Korea's biggest auto maker, Hyundai Motor Co., whose assembly line has been halted by striking workers, posted a 15% gain in earnings, to 20.6 billion won, on sales of 1.44 trillion won. Hyundai Motor is part of the Hyundai group.    Daewoo Electronics Co., whose operations have also been disrupted by labor strife, doubled its earnings, to 6.7 billion won, and increased sales 60%, to 398.7 billion won. Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd., which last week settled a weeklong strike, reported earnings of four billion won, up 32%, on sales of 216 billion won. Both companies are units of the Daewoo group.    Investment analysts attributed the strong corporate performance to low international interest rates, relatively cheap oil and the weak dollar. Company owners and managers acknowledged that the results make settlement of labor disputes difficult; labor leaders said higher compensation for Korean workers is long overdue.    The government and the ruling Democratic Justice Party, which is facing a presidential election later this year, are siding increasingly with the workers -- even though most work stoppages are technically illegal.    &quot;The employees have legitimate complaints against management, especially the refusal of many companies to accept free trade unions,&quot; said a senior Labor Ministry official. &quot;The fat-cat owners are making a lot of money and the time has come for them to share more of it with their workers.&quot;    As long as the workers stay mostly nonviolent, the official said, the government is determined to &quot;let them solve their problems directly through negotiations with management. We won't intervene.&quot;    The government said Friday that 87 new strikes were reported, bringing to 269 the number of job actions under way. The labor turmoil, which began not long after the government's announcement of political concessions in June, has cost the country an estimated $295 million in lost production and exports, the government said.    In addition to demanding higher wages and bonuses, the workers want the right to form their own labor unions.    One potentially explosive confrontation eased Friday. Seven hundred striking coal miners and their families dismantled barricades on a railroad bridge after officials of Tongwon Coal Mining Co. agreed to increase bonuses.    The miners had confronted 1,500 heavily armed riot police for three days in the most serious of a wave of protests and violence to affect the mines of the Taebaek mountain region, a traditional center of labor militancy. </TEXT></DOC>
