GRACZYK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unemployed Houston man whose lack of healthinsurance was cited by Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidentialdebate with Republican George Bush is returning a $400 check Bush'snephew sent him to buy insurance.   Charles Strickland, 42, who lost his job two years ago when hisHouston energy company moved, said he was upset with the checkbecause he found it degrading.   ``When I first opened it up, I felt kind of proud,'' Stricklandsaid Wednesday at a news conferenee organized by Dukakis staffers.   ``But the more I read the letter, the more I believed that manhad no concern for me, my son or my family. His main purpose was apolitical ploy. As an individual, I'm tired of being used as apolitical football on this issue.''   The check was sent by James R. Pierce, Jr., a Houston insurancebroker, who is a nephew of Barbara Bush, the vice president's wife.   Pierce on Wednesday denied the check was politically motivated.He said he was responding only to Strickland's needs.   ``I'm a little upset about it all,'' Pierce said. ``Myintentions were personally motivated and emotionally driven. I'msorry that he thought they were politically motivated, because theyweren't.''   Strickland told Dukakis a week ago during a campaign stop at aHouston hospital that he could not allow his 11-year-old son toplay sports in school because he did not have health insurance andcould not afford to buy any.   Dukakis on Sunday said Strickland's son could not play LittleLeague because of a lack of insurance.   Little League officials in Houston complained that Dukakis waswrong and that insurance was available if parents could not affordit for their child.   Pierce said he mailed the check after reading about Stricklandin the newspaper and had not consulted the Bush campaign.   ``It's unfortunate you try to do something good and it getstwisted by the many cynics in the world,'' Pierce said.   In his letter to Strickland, Pierce said the Dukakis platform``will only drag all American wage earners back into the malaisedays. The cost of his social programs will only make it harder foryou to improve your family's standard of living.''   Strickland, in a letter accompanying the returned check, saidRepublicans ``have made my life and my story into a politicalpublicity ploy.   ``Mr. Pierce, we don't need to be patronized,'' Stricklandwrote. ``We need a health insurance program like the one MikeDukakis has proposed for the nation and like he has done inMassachusetts. I don't need your pity.''</TEXT></DOC>
