Ferris, and outlined a plan that would reverse Mr. Ferris's strategy of building a full-service travel company.    In a statement, Chicago-based Allegis said that Frank A. Olson was elected to succeed Mr. Ferris in both posts. Mr. Olson also was elected chairman and chief executive of Hertz Corp., the rental-car unit of Allegis, and a director of Allegis.    The board directed the company's financial advisers, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., to reconsider all existing proposals for restructuring Allegis. Charles F. Luce, senior director of Allegis, said it is likely that the company will sell its hotel and rental car concerns and refocus on its United Airlines unit. Mr. Olson will recommend to Allegis shareholders, among other things, that its name be changed to United Airlines Inc. Morgan Stanley is to report back to the board with a plan &quot;to maximize shareholder value&quot; within two to three weeks.    Edward Carlson, chairman emeritus of Allegis and retired chairman and chief executive of UAL Inc., predecessor of Allegis, will rejoin the board of Allegis.    Mr. Luce outlined a plan that could result in the sale of the Hertz unit, the company's Westin and Hilton International hotels, and a recapitalization of United Airlines, potentially involving the active participation of all employee groups in a broad-based employee stock ownership plan.    Mr. Olson said he would hold discussions with Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that holds a 13% stake in Allegis, which yesterday launched a consent solicitation to replace the entire Allegis board. He also said he will talk with airline employee groups. The union that represents United pilots has been trying to purchase the airline for the past two months. The company's other large employee group, its machinists, has been at odds with management in recent weeks over labor negotiations.    Keith Gollust, a principal of Coniston Partners, declined to comment until the group had learned all the details of the Allegis action.    The Allegis board praised Mr. Ferris's &quot;vision and leadership in bringing together the units now valued so highly by the market.&quot;    Mr. Ferris's business strategy had come under increasing criticism since April, when the pilots union offered to purchase the airline for $4.5 billion. The union's bid sent the company's stock climbing and fueled shareholder concerns that Allegis would be worth more if its subsidiaries were operated as independent companies.    The company rejected the pilots' bid on the ground that it would saddle the company with too much debt. But just two months later, when faced with a takeover threat from Coniston Partners, Mr. Ferris announced that the company would take on an additional $3 billion in debt to finance a special $60-a-share cash distribution to holders.    That move was widely criticized by industry analysts and debt-rating services as being too risky in the highly competitive airline industry.    Mr. Ferris was also criticized for initiating an unusual aircraft-financing accord that gave Seattle-based Boeing Co. $700 million of Allegis notes that could be converted into common stock.    The accord, which would give Boeing a 16% stake in Allegis, was meant as an anti-takeover measure. But after the $60-a-share cash distribution was announced, there was growing concern on the Allegis board about the windfall profit that Boeing stood to gain if it converted the notes. Sources close to Allegis estimated that Boeing could reap between $109.2 million and $244.5 million from the cash distribution. It was unclear from Mr. Luce's statement last night whether the board would also try now to renegotiate the Boeing agreement.    It was also unclear whether the pilots would now give up their efforts to purchase the airline. The union's relations with Mr. Ferris have been strained ever since a bitter strike in 1985, and one of the union's clear goals was to force out Mr. Ferris.    Mr. Ferris did have his supporters, who complained that the stock market and the union weren't giving his strategy a chance. Mr. Ferris had envisioned Allegis as a one-stop shopping service in which Allegis travelers could simultaneously buy a plane ticket and rent a hotel room and a car.    Coniston, on the other hand, said the subsidiaries would be worth more and would operate more efficiently as independent companies.    Allegis shares closed yesterday at $90.75, up $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
