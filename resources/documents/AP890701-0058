Until recently, a candidate like Ms. Uemura would not havegenerated much optimism. But a series of scandals and an unpopularnew tax have played into the hands of opposition office-seekers.   Public opinion polls paint a dismal picture for the governingLiberal Democratic Party in an election Sunday for the 128 TokyoMunicipal Assembly seats.   With 9 million eligible voters, Tokyo is being watched closely asan indicator of what could lie ahead for the Liberal Democrats,Japan's governing party since it was formed in 1954. Nationwideelections for half the upper house of Parliament are scheduled July23.   Only 25 percent of Tokyo voters polled by the Asahi Shimbunnewspaper said they plan to support Liberal Democratic candidates,down from 34 percent who expressed support before the last suchelections were held in 1985.   A Kyodo News Service poll released Thursday showed 16 percentsupporting the Socialists, the top national opposition party, whilesupport for the Liberal Democrats had fallen from 42.4 to only 13.2percent.   The increased chances for women may come from voters' anger overa sex scandal involving Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who allegedlyhas kept several paid mistresses.   Requests for Uno to give speeches for the party's municipalcandidates have dropped off. At one rally he attended, governingparty supporters scuffled with women carrying placards that said:``We don't need a prostitution premier.''   Senior party officials are considering replacing Uno after theTokyo polling if the Liberal Democrats lose badly because a loss inthe upper house election then ``will be obvious due to Uno'swomanizing scandal,'' the Mainichi newspaper said.   ``The Uno Cabinet now seems virtually dead,'' it said in aneditorial.   Campaigning a few days before the election, Ms. Uemura rodethrough the streets of Minato Ward in a van, waving and askingpassers-by for support.   Like all candidates, Ms. Uemura wore white gloves and a largecarnation in her lapel. She said she spends 12 hours campaigningeach day.   ``The ant has brought down the elephant,'' Ms. Uemura said,referring to the upset victory of a female Socialist in aparliamentary by-election on Sunday in a traditionally conservativearea in northern Japan.   In the back of the van, two attractive young women _ whatJapanese campaign managers call ``warbler girls'' _ waved andsmiled. One of them, Yukari Hibiya, said she was motivated by the$177-a-day pay, not strong political convictions.   ``But I wouldn't have accepted this kind of work from the LDP,since they're behind the tax,'' she said.   The Liberal Democrats forced a 3 percent sales tax throughParliament in December despite an opposition boycott. The sales tax,part of a controversial tax change, took effect April 1.   Alarmed by the losses at the polls and reeling from the Recruitinfluence-buying scandal that brought down Uno's predecessor, NoboruTakeshita, the Liberal Democrats has pledged to clean up its image.   ``As head of the party, I'd like to devote myself entirely to theparty and political reforms,'' Uno said after he became primeminister June 2.   Uno was chosen to head the party because he is one of the fewsenior Liberal Democrats untainted by Recruit, a publishingconglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars in politicaldonations and underpriced stocks in exchange for favors.   Among the reforms announced by the Liberal Democrats aredissolution of party factions, which create power blocs but forceleaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers'political activities. Nearly all Liberal Democratic lawmakers belongto one of six factions.   Critics say the governing party is not serious about change.   ``Their plans are full of loopholes,'' said Satsuki Eda, leaderof the Social Democratic Federation, the fifth-largest bloc inParliament.   Eda said self-restraint is needed, not legislation.   ``They don't need to spend so much money,'' Eda said. ``I don'tspend so much, but I survive elections.''</TEXT></DOC>
