The procedure of convolutingeach element of the picture matrix with the averaging matrix of a requiredcoefficient of the standard error reduction is used. The program providesfor the choice of 12 various averaging matrices. The method was evaluatedby means of scintiscans type 1, 2 and 3 of the IAEA phantom. The differencesin the visibility and detectability of foci in the pictures processedby the above technique with the stationary noise level and that of multipleconvolution with a binomial matrix (non-stationary noise level) weretaken as evaluation criteria. 7 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
