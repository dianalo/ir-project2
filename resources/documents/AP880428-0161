Unemployment in the city reached an 18-year low at 4.7 percentin the first quarter of the year, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt,regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.The national unemployment rate for the quarter was 6.2 percent.   The improvement in the city showed up across the board, withjoblessness down not only among white men, but also among blacks,Hispanics, women and teen-agers.   None of these figures, however, declined to the levels of 1968,when city unemployment was only 3.1 percent.   ``It is clear that concerns about imminent and substantialeconomic decline following last October's crash have not becomereality,'' Ehrenhalt said in a statement. Some experts hadpredicted the city would lose as many as 50,000 jobs in itsfinancial services sector.   Although Wall Street has lost 7,000 jobs in the six months sinceOctober, in the two years before that it had added 30,000 jobs toreach an all-time high of 160,000 people working in the financialdistrict.   Also since October, another 4,000 jobs were lost in theever-declining manufacturing field.   But overall, since the October crash, private-sector jobs wereup by 10,000, thanks mainly to an addition of 14,000 serviceindustry jobs and 5,300 jobs in construction, Ehrenhalt said.</TEXT></DOC>
