I had too much to offer.''   Two years after arriving in this East African nation, Wells isworking to open a training center to mass produce inexpensive plowsand harnesses for peasant farmers with U.S.-government money andland donated by the Kenyan government.   He expects to open the Mutomo Community Technical Center byJanuary with an class of 100 students.   The Kenya Rural Enterprises Program gave Wells nearly $300,000to build the center and the Kenyan government donated a seven-acresite. The enterprises program is financed by the U.S. Agency forInternational Development (USAID) through World Education Inc. ofBoston to help set up small businesses in rural areas.   Wells, who comes from Park Ridge, Ill., left MarquetteUniversity in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1951 with a bachelor's degree inelectrical engineering. He worked as a design engineer, managed acomputer chips manufacturing company and helped various companiesautomate their operations before establishing his own company,Wells Automation Products, in Chicago in 1983.   He closed the business in January 1986, when the economy turnedsour.   Wells, a widower, said ``the children had gone their seperateways,'' so he decided to strike out on his own.   He joined the Peace Corps, an organization usually staffed bypeople a third his age.   Wells was sent to Kenya in July, 1986, and eventually wound upin Mutomo, a market town of fewer than 1,000 people 140 milessoutheast of the capital, Nairobi. There, the Danish InternationalDevelopment Agency had asked other donor governments to help findsomeone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows.   ``I wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to bigplants would do here,'' recalled Wells, a stocky, balding man.   He spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of Naivasha fororientation before coming to Mutomo about 18 months ago. He foundworkers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand.   ``I was astounded,'' he said. ``The men sat on dirt floorshacking away at wood with pangas (machetes) and producing beautifulframes for harnesses.''   He intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to theprocess so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a fasterrate.   Days are hot and nights chilly in Mutomo, which sits in themiddle of scrubland, rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrentialrains that come twice a year.   Peasants of the Kamba tribe, mainly women and children becausemen seek fortunes elsewhere, try to grow corn, sorghum and millet.They also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys.   But they lack affordable tools, particularly plows.   Wells pushed the idea for a training center, writing proposalsand seeking money.   Josephat Muliungi, development coordinator for the Kitui RomanCatholic Diocese, said the center will be the largest economicenterprise in Mutomo.   The area is one of Kenya's poorest; average income for a peasantfarm family is less than $100 a year.   ``Once the students are gainfully employed, we expect a sizeableincrease in income for at least 1,000 families within a year,''Muliungi said.   Wells said the center will continue making harnesses and plowsbut in larger quantities and better quality. He hopes to reduce theprice of a plow from the current 450 shillings ($26.50).   Only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after theyear-long training. The others will be organized into groups, givena little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnessesin the villages around Mutomo.   The center will continue to offer advise on how to run simplebusinesses.   Wells already is looking to expand production to include handtools, bicycles, carts and solar-powered radios.   ``People say it cannot be done,'' he said. ``But I think it canbe done. It is possible.''   Wells, whose Peace Corps stint has been extended by a year, saidthe center can be duplicated in other parts of Kenya and wants tostay after his Peace Corps time is up.   ``It is a beautiful thing what I'm doing here,'' he said. ``Andit's good for people like me.   ``I'm young again. I'm thinking again.''</TEXT></DOC>
