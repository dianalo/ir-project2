The closing      system is formed by an obturator which forms part of a component made of      an elastically deformable material and a seat which forms part of another      component of the dispensing head. The obturator is in contact with its      associated seat in the absence of any dispensing action, moving away from      the seat by elastic deformation under the pressure of the product to be      dispensed, and returning by elasticity into contact with the seat when the      dispensing stops. The obturator is subjected to the action of a      constraining element tending to keep it applied to the seat wherewith it      cooperates. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention concerns a unit for dispensing one or several fluid      product(s) in a liquid form or a more or less thick cream (or pasty) form.      This unit permits in particular the dispensing of cosmetic or      pharmaceutical products. </PAR><PAC>  PRIOR ART </PAC><PAR>  Many dispensing units are known comprising a container containing the      product to be dispensed and having a dispensing head fixed thereon in a      detachable or non-detachable manner. This dispensing head comprises a      device allowing the user to actuate the dispensing, and at least one      dispensing duct communicating on the one hand with the container      containing the product to be dispensed and on the other hand, with the      outside. </PAR><PAR>  When there are several products to be dispensed, the container may in the      known manner comprise several parts, that is to say it is either      constituted by several independent containers or it is constituted by a      single container subdivided by internal partitions into several      compartments, with each of the containers or compartments connected to a      duct of the same dispensing head. The dispensing head may also contain a      compartment for a product different from the one in the container, this      compartment being connected to the dispensing duct for the product in the      container or to a different duct. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that after the dispensing of the product, a part of it remains      in the dispensing duct. This part of the product is in contact with the      air during the renewed air intake by the dispensing head and possibly      during storage. This product may therefore be degraded by oxidation or      contaminated by impurities and microorganisms in the air and, as a result,      during a subsequent dispensing the dispensed product may have lost its      qualities and even have become noxious. </PAR><PAR>  In U.S. Pat. No. 4,099,651, it has been proposed to resolve this problem by      a closure system that only opens under the pressure of the product to be      dispensed. This U.S. Patent describes a dispensing head comprising a      tubular element fixed on the end fitting of a flexible tube. The tubular      element contains, over at least a part of its length, a flat partition      projecting from the tubular element. Two outlet ducts are thus defined for      the product. A sleeve made of an elastic material is fitted on to the      tubular element and on to the portion of the partition projecting      therefrom. The closure system is constituted by the edge of the sleeve      made of the elastic material which rests on the two faces on the side      remote from the end of the flat partition. This edge is in contact with      these two faces of the partition when no dispensing action takes place,      and moves away from these faces during dispensing of the product and      returns into contact with these faces by elasticity when the dispensing      stops. </PAR><PAR>  However, in such a closure system, the contact between the edge of the      sleeve and the face of the partition is ensured by only the elasticity of      the edge zone of the sleeve and frequently this results in a very      inadequate seal during the state of rest, irrespective of the contact      surface between the edge of the sleeve and each of the faces of the      partition, in particular when the dispensed product is viscous. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to provide a closure system for      such dispensing units, which is perfectly leakproof during the state of      rest, that is to say, when the product is not being dispensed, which only      opens under the pressure of the product to be dispensed, and which on its      own virtually does not allow any air to be readmitted. This system is      therefore aseptic per se which is not the case as far as said U.S. Pat.      No. 4,099,651 is concerned. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention therefore provides therefore provides a unit for      dispensing at least one fluid product, which unit comprises: a container      and a dispensing head containing at least one dispensing duct for the      product(s) to be dispensed, a closure system situated at the end portion      of said at least one duct and opening towards the outside of the or each      dispensing duct, the closure system being formed by at least one obturator      which forms part of a component of the dispensing head made of an      elastically deformable material and by at least one seat which forms part      of another component of the dispensing head, the obturator(s) being in      contact with their associated seat when no dispensing action takes place,      moving away from the seat by elastic deformation under the pressure of the      product to be dispensed, and returning into contact with the seat by      elasticity when the dispensing stops; characterized in that the or each      said obturator is subjected to the action of a constraining element      tending to keep it applied to the seat wherewith it cooperates to ensure      the seal of the closing contact. </PAR><PAR>  It shall be understood that the seal mentioned in the definition given      below is only ensured subject to production tolerances. According to the      invention, the seal must be sufficient to prevent practically any air      intake through the closure system on completion of dispensing of the      product, irrespective of the viscosity of the product to be dispensed.      Since the seal is to some extent a function of the contact zone between      the obturator and the seat, the invention makes provision for choosing a      contact zone having an adequate dimension to ensure the seal. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, the closure system therefore forms a      valve or discharge valve which can only open in one direction: i.e. in the      dispensing direction of the product. </PAR><PAR>  The closure system according to the invention, which in practice is only      constituted by a small contact zone between an obturator of flexible      material and a seat, has the advantage of being capable of being fitted on      all the dispensing heads, whether these are mounted on welded tubes, or on      dispensers with a follower piston or with a flexible bag, or on rigid      bottles. It may also be easily incorporated in dispensing heads with very      different aesthetic shapes. In fact, the flexible component comprising the      obturator and the component carrying the seat of the obturator may have      various forms. </PAR><PAR>  The obturator may be constituted either by a lip moving away from the seat      by bending perpendicularly to the direction of the pressure of the      product, or by an elastic element having one part thereof disposed facing      the outlet opening of the dispensing duct and which, in this zone, moves      away from the seat by elasticity in a direction parallel to the direction      of the pressure of the product. </PAR><PAR>  The obturator may be of any elastically deformable material. It is,      preferably, made of a natural, synthetic or thermoplastic elastomer. The      elastomers which may be used include, for example, styrene-butadiene      copolymers, nitrile rubbers, polychloroprene or neoprene, EDPM rubber,      polyurethanes, silicone rubber and ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers. When      the obturator is a lip, the obturator may be constituted by an aluminium      foil fixed to a sheet of plastic material (e.g. polyethylene or      polyethylene terephthalate (PET)), or sandwiched between two plastic      sheets. </PAR><PAR>  The seat is preferably of a rigid material, but may also, in particular      when the obturator has the shape of a lip, be of resilient material. </PAR><PAR>  The constraining device has the function of keeping the obturator applied      to the seat during storage and of increasing the pressure necessary for      obtaining deformation of the obturator, thus improving the seal of the      closure system. It may also have the function of facilitating return of      the obturator into its closing position. It is advantageously adjustable      so as to make it possible to adjust the pressure of the product that is      necessary for opening the closure system. In the absence of a constraining      element, it is frequently difficult to maintain the leakproof quality of      the seam during storage before and after the first use of the product to      be dispensed. </PAR><PAR>  When the obturator is constituted by a lip forming part of a resilient      component made of a flexible material, in particular a strip, the      constraining element may be formed by a rigid element bearing on the      component made of a flexible material or be fixed thereto so as to keep      the lip applied to the seat. This rigid element may be a cover or a      support maintaining the component made of the flexible material in the      vicinity of the lip, a partition perpendicular to the direction of flow      bearing on a wall parallel thereto, of the resilient component; this wall      may be obtained, for example by means of an extra thickness of the      component made of a flexible material. It is also possible for the      constraining element to be not rigid but of resilient material: it may,      for example, be formed by a resilient bead or stud limiting the      displacement of the flexible lip. </PAR><PAR>  When the obturator is a resilient part moving away from the seat in the      direction of the pressure of the product, the constraining element is more      particularly formed by a stud or bead of a resilient material maintaining      the flexible part on the rigid element comprising the seat so as to oppose      the deformation of the obturator. </PAR><PAR>  The end portion of the dispensing duct is preferably delimited on the one      hand by a part made partly of a flexible material, comprising the      obturator, and on the other hand by a part comprising the seat of the      obturator. The duct may be arranged in the part comprising the obturator      and/or in the part comprising the seat. In this case, the passing of the      product from the duct to the closure system is effected via a slope so as      to facilitate the flow of the product while avoiding a threshold effect.      This slope is advantageously situated in the seat. The duct can also be      delimited by a zone where the part comprising the obturator and the part      comprising the seat are fitted together in a leakproof manner, for example      by bonding or by means of a weld bead. </PAR><PAR>  In a first embodiment, the obturator is formed by a lip moving away from      the seat by bending perpendicular to the direction of pressure of the      product to be dispensed. In the closure system, the contact zone between      the flexible lip and the seat may be curved or wave-shaped; it is      preferably constituted by a flat portion which can for example be      rectangular or may have the shape of a tongue rounded at its end. The lip      may project slightly from the seat so as to form a spatula for the direct      application of the product dispensed on to a surface, in particular the      skin in the case of a cosmetic product. The seat may also project from the      lip, the outlet for the product being effected inside a surface      appertaining to the part comprising the seat and/or to a cover or support.      The flat portion of the contact zone may be perpendicular to the      longitudinal axis of the unit, slant in relation to this axis or be      parallel thereto along the direction of the end portion of the duct. The      part comprising the lip preferably has the general shape of a strip made      of a resilient material reducing in thickness to form the lip; the      reduction in thickness preferably takes the form of a bevel. The strip may      comprise a core formed by an aluminium foil so as to render it more      impermeable; this core may be placed on or beneath the strip or be      embedded in the resilient material forming the strip. The strip may, or      may not extend over the whole transverse cross section of the dispensing      head. </PAR><PAR>  In a first variant, the part comprising the seat and the seat on which the      lip bears, are made of a rigid material. In this case, the constraining      element is advantageously formed by a cover or a support made of a rigid      material, the strip made of the resilient material comprising the lip      which is thus contained between two rigid parts: the part comprising the      seat and the support or cover. Reference will be made to a support for a      part situated on the side of the container in relation to the strip, and      to a cover for a part situated on the opposite side to the container in      relation to the strip made of a resilient material. It is, of course,      understood that the cover or the support leaves the lip forming part of      the strip free so that it can move away from the seat. The cover or      support preferably has a shape facilitating the application of the lip to      the seat and the return of the lip into its rest position in a leakproof      contact with the seat, that is to say the cover or support has a shape      promoting the resilient memory of the lip. For this purpose, the cover or      the support may comprise at least one rib or at least one stud fitting      into a respective said rib or into at least one corresponding hole of the      strip. The cover may also comprise a sliding flap system so as to regulate      the constraint exerted on the lip. </PAR><PAR>  In a particular embodiment of this variant, the dispensing head comprises a      lateral outlet; the at least one duct of the dispensing head is formed by      a first conduit parallel to the longitudinal axis of the dispensing unit      communicating with the container, and by a second conduit forming an angle      with the first conduit, the part comprising the seat made of a rigid      material and the strip made of a resilient material delimiting the second      conduit over the whole of its length and constituting at the end of the      second conduit a closure system formed by the lip situated at the outer      end of the strip and by an end surface of the part comprising the seat.      The closure system and a portion of the second conduit are preferably      disposed in a lateral extension forming a beak for example a radial beak      of the dispensing head. </PAR><PAR>  In a second variant, the seat and the part comprising the seat are made of      a resilient material. The part comprising the seat may then be formed by a      second strip made of a resilient material substantially parallel to the      first strip, advantageously identical with the first strip, the strip and      the seat made of a resilient material being externally held between the      rigid walls constituting the constraining elements. A semi-rigid wall may      be provided between the strip and the seat made of a resilient material,      the lip and the seat projecting beyond the end of the semi-rigid wall, and      the lip and the seat being capable of coming to bear on each other when      the system is at rest. The strip and the part comprising the seat      preferably surround the semi-rigid wall and are, in this case,      advantageously moulded from a single piece. </PAR><PAR>  In a second embodiment of the invention, the obturator is formed by a      resilient part, one part whereof is disposed opposite the outlet opening      of the dispensing duct and which in this zone, moves away from a rigid      seat by elasticity parallel to the direction of pressure of the product.      The resilient part advantageously forms part of a torus externally round      the dispensing head. The torus may completely surround the dispensing head      or may be interrupted and comprise at each end an achorage in the part      comprising the seat. To allow the flow of the product to be directed to      the outlet of the dispensing duct, the part made of a resilient material      comprises a feeder duct for the product. One may also arrange, in the      rigid seat opposite the part made of a resilient material, a duct having      the same function. The cross-section of the resilient torus may have      various formssuch as: circular, elliptical, triangular or similar. The      constraining element is advantageously formed by a stud capable of being      inserted in a corresponding recess of the part comprising a rigid seat,      this stud being disposed on the side remote from the feeder duct for the      product. </PAR><PAR>  The closure system in accordance with the invention may be used in many      types of dispensing heads. </PAR><PAR>  In a first type, the dispensing head does not allow any readmission of air      i.e. it does not have any air inlet. In this case, a vacuum is gradually      formed in the container. The container used then preferably comprises a      follower piston which moves towards the opening of the container as the      dispensing is carried out, or comprises a flexible bag or tube, the walls      of the bag or tube coming closer to each other as the dispensing proceeds.      In this case the closure system in accordance with the invention, which      closes immediately after the product to be dispensed has passed, may make      it possible to dispense with the mounting of a second valve, whereas the      dispensing heads generally used on containers with follower pistons or      bags usually comprise two valves. </PAR><PAR>  The dispensing head may also comprise a second valve associated with the      closure system in accordance with the invention, the latter forming the      first valve. In this case, the push button may carry a piston displaced in      an internal space forming a pump barrel. The push button may      advantageously comprise a flexible membrane, accessible from the outside      which performs the function of a piston by modifying the volume of the      internal space. The volume of the pump barrel formed may be disposed      parallel to the longitudinal axis of the unit or perpendicular to the      latter, the push button being actuated parallel or perpendicular to the      longitudinal axis. </PAR><PAR>  Provision may be made for a part of the wall of the dispensing head to be      made of a thin resilient material, so that it can be pierced by means of a      hypodermic needle; the needle serves either to create a vacuum, and      therefore to eliminate the air and to draw up the product contained in the      container into the dispensing head without contaminating the dispensing      opening, or to create an excess pressure which allows the dispensing head      to be cleaned out by means of a sterile gas, for example nitrogen. The      thin part may constitute a portion of the strip provided with a lip of the      closure system. </PAR><PAR>  A second type of dispensing head, the latter comprises an air inlet or      readmission valve. This air readmission valve is preferably constituted by      a valve made of a resilient material. This valve is preferably cup-shaped      and advantageously slit on the side wall near its top. This valve is more      particularly arranged in the strip of resilient material forming the      obturator. </PAR><PAR>  The dispensing head may comprise a device allowing the closure system to be      locked and protected during storage and which is removed for effecting the      first dispensing. This locking device may be a device removed for the      first dispensing and which is not replaced subsequently. However, it is      advantageous for the locking device to be replaced after one or several      dispensing actions to ensure the seal during transport and to prevent an      accidental opening of the closure system. This device is most frequently      formed by a cover fixed by screwing or catch engagement, and which covers      practically the whole of the dispensing head. It is also possible for the      locking device to act only on the closure system proper. In this latter      case, the locking device may be constituted by a sliding flap or a small      tearable plate which for example blocks the flexibility of the lip of the      resilient strip of the closure system. It may also be constituted by a      stud which blocks the resilience of the obturator in the closure system by      catch engagement in the vicinity of the dispensing opening; this stud is      advantageously disposed on a stirrup which is capable of swivelling round      the two axes of the dispensing head. The stirrup may also serve as a lever      for exerting the dispensing pressure after the catch engagement of the      stud has been released. </PAR><PAR>  Many other dispensing units in accordance with the invention may be      envisaged by the expert, without thereby departing from the scope of the      invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In order that the present invention may more readily understood, several      embodiments thereof will now be described below on a purely illustrative      and non-restrictive basis, with reference to the attached drawings. </PAR><PAR>  In these drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a dispensing unit in accordance      with the invention, not provided with a second valve, in the storage      position;

The part 5 is provided with two      circular beads 5a and 5b having the same outer diameters. </PAR><PAR>  The part 6 with the smaller diameter has at least one rectangular cut out 7      on its upper edge. </PAR><PAR>  The dispensing head 3 is a head for lateral dispensing. It has a generally      cylindrical shape provided with a lateral radial extension forming a beak      3a; the closing system F is situated at the outer end of this beak 3a. </PAR><PAR>  This dispensing head 3 comprises a part 8 comprising the seat situated in a      plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis X--X of the unit 1, covering      the whole external surface of the dispensing head which is furthest away      from the tube 2, that is to say, the upper surface in FIG. 1. This part 8      comprising the seat has the shape of a disc provided with a radial beak      8a, rectangular in shape and projecting outwardly. The part 8 comprising      the seat is also provided with a cylindrical hole 8b wherein the narrow      part 6 of the neck 4 of the tube 2 becomes inserted. A groove 8c      terminates near the outer edge of the beak 8a of the part 8 comprising the      seat with a slope 8d inclined towards the outside and towards the tube 2,      the inner face (the upper face in FIG. 1) of the outer edge of the beak      forms the seat 8e. The seat 8e is situated in a plane perpendicular to the      longitudinal axis X--X of the dispensing unit and has the shape of a      rectangle. </PAR><PAR>  A strip 9 made of a resilient material comprising the lip of the closing      system is placed into contact with the inner face (the lower face in FIG.      1) of the part 8 comprising the seat 8e and rests on a support 10. The      strip 9 made of a resilient material covers the whole of the inner surface      of the part 8 comprising the seat, that is to say, it has the shape of a      disc provided with a beak whose end is bevelled and which is situated      opposite the beak 8a of the part 8 comprising the seat. The bevelled end      of the beak is inclined towards the part 8 comprising the seat and its      edge forms the lip 9a of the closing system. </PAR><PAR>  To sum up, the closing system F in accordance with the invention is      constituted by the seat formed by the surface 8e of the beak 8a and by the      lip 9a of the strip 9, which lip is formed by the outer bevelled edge of      the beak. </PAR><PAR>  The support 10 performs the function of the constraining element. It      comprises a flat, rigid wall parallel to the part 8 comprising the seat      and to the strip 9 having the shape of a disc 11 provided with a      rectangular beak 11a disposed opposite the beak 8a of the part comprising      the seat 8 and the beak 9a of the strip 9. The bevel of the beak of the      strip 9 forming the lip 9a projects beyond the beak 11a of the rigid wall.      In the flat side 11, there is arranged an axial and circular opening 11b      surrounded by a cylindrical skirt 11c turned towards the tube 2. The skirt      11c surrounds the narrowest part 6 of the neck 4 of the tube 2. </PAR><PAR>  The support 10 also comprises a peripheral skirt 12 fixed at the periphery      of the part 8 comprising the seat 8e by a rib and groove system, except      for the region of the edge of the beak 8a of the part comprising the seat      8e. This skirt 12 comprises a cut out opposite the beak 11a of the rigid      disc 11. </PAR><PAR>  The skirt 12 is provided on its inner side with a circular bead 12a which      comes to be positioned by catch engagement under the bead 5a of the      largest diameter part 5 of the neck 4 of the tube 2. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus functions as follows: when the user wishes to dispense the      product contained in the tube 2, he turns the dispensing head 3 until the      cut out 7 of the neck 4 comes to be opposite the groove 8c of the seat 8.      Then he squeezes on the tube 2, which causes the product to pass through      the first duct formed by the neck 4 into the second perpendicular duct      delimited by the strip 9 and the groove 8c of the part 8 comprising the      seat. </PAR><PAR>  When the product arrives in the vicinity of the closing system F, the lip      9a formed by the edge moves away, because the surface 8e of the beak 8a is      bent away from the surface 8 comprising the seat, perpendicular to the      direction of pressure of the product, and the product can emerge as      illustrated in FIG. 2. The support 10 holding the strip limits the      displacement of the lip 9a during the opening of the closing system. When      the user stops pressing on the tube 2, there is no longer any pressure of      the product to be dispensed in the region of the closing system F and the      lip 9a returns by elasticity into contact with the seat 8e, in the closing      zone F. The support 10 then exerts a certain constraint on the strip 9,      which applies the lip 9a against the seat 8e and ensures the suitable      desired seal. Air can no longer penetrate into the tube 2, and therefore      the product can no longer be contaminated by impurities or microorganisms,      nor be oxidized. </PAR><PAR>  Like FIGS. 1 and 2, FIG. 3 represents a dispensing unit wherein the closing      system F comprises a lip carried by a strip made of a resilient material,      but the dispensing head is mounted on a pump bottle. The dispensing unit      is designated by 101 as a whole. It comprises a rigid bottle 102 on which      is fixed a pump system 104 and a dispensing head 103. The dispensing head      103 comprises an outer radial projection forming a beak 103a, the closing      system F being disposed at its end. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIG. 3, the bottle 102 contains a dip tube      102b and is provided on the edge of its side wall nearer the opening with      a male screw thread 102a. </PAR><PAR>  The pump 104 is mounted on the bottle 102 at the opening. </PAR><PAR>  The pump 104 comprises an outer cover cap 105 constituted by a first      cylindrical skirt 105a carrying a female screw thread 105g corresponding      to the male screw thread 102a of the bottle, an annular shoulder 105b,      situated in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Y--Y of the      dispensing unit which rests on the edge of the opening of the bottle 102,      a second cylindrical skirt 105c parallel to the first skirt 105a, but with      a smaller diameter and a second annular shoulder 105d parallel to the      first shoulder 105b wherein there is arranged a circular opening 105e      centered on the axis Y--Y. The skirt 105c carries a discontinuous inner      annular flange 105f. The pump system 104 also comprises an element 106 of      a cylindrical-conical shape whose conical part is tapered towards the      bottle 102. This element 106 is provided on the outer edge of its      cylindrical portion with an annular flange 106a resting on the      discontinuous annular flange 105f of the outer cover cap 105. The edge of      the conical portion of the element 106 is connected to a cylindrical duct      106b in which the dip tube 102b is fitted. The cylindrical-conical element      106 contains a compression spring 107 and a ball 108 with a diameter      larger than that of the duct 106b and smaller than that of the cylindrical      portion of the element 106. A hollow piston 110 providing an inner axial      duct 109 can slide in the cylindrical portion of the element 106. It      comprises, firstly, an enlarged portion 110a, having an outer diameter      equal, save for the necessary clearance, to the inner diameter of the      cylindrical portion of the element 106, on which portion 110a the spring      107 bears, secondly a portion 110b with an outer diameter equal to the      diameter of the opening 105e of the cover cap 105 save for the necessary      clearance, and thirdly a smaller diameter portion 110c that is fitted in      the dispensing head 103. A rectangular cut out 114 is arranged on the edge      of this portion 110c. </PAR><PAR>  The dispensing head 103 is constituted by a part 111 comprising the seat      111e, a strip 112 comprising the lip 112a of the closing system F and a      support 113. The part 111 comprising the seat is a disc made of a rigid      plastic material provided with a beak 111a. This disc 111 bears on the      portion 110c of the hollow piston 110. A radial groove 111c extending from      the edge of the portion 110c of the hollow piston 110 as far as the beak      111a is arranged in the part 111 comprising the seat 111e. The groove 111c      terminates in a slope 111d inclined outwardly and towards the bottle 102.      The edge of the beak 111a also slopes outwardly and towards the bottle 102      and terminates in a flat rectangular surface 111e constituting the seat. A      strip 112 made of a resilient material is disposed on a rigid support 113      beneath the inner face of the part 111 comprising the seat. The strip 112      also has the shape of a disc provided with a radial beak. It comprises a      circular opening 112b to receive the portion 110c of the hollow piston      110. A bevel 112c cut on the edge of this opening 112b opens into the      radial groove 111c of the seat 111. The end of the beak of the strip 112      is bevelled so as to form a lip 111a that is in contact with the seat      111e. The seat 111e and the lip 112a of the strip 112 in contact therewith      form the closing system F in accordance with the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The rigid support 113 on which the strip 112 is resting, performs the      function of a constraining element. It is constituted by a disc-shaped      element, provided with a radial beak 113a having a flat surface on the      side of the strip and carrying an external skirt 113b extending on either      side of the element 113 except in the region of the edge of the beak 113a      where it only extends towards the bottle 102. This skirt 113b is fitted on      the edge of the part 111 comprising the seat 111e by means of a rib and      groove system except in the end region of the beak 111a. The edge of the      part of the skirt 113b turned towards the bottle 102 is situated in a      plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Y--Y of the dispensing unit      and it is circular; its inner diameter is greater than that of the part      105c of the outer cover cap 105 so as to be capable of sliding thereover.      The skirt 113b is cylindrical as a whole, except at the level of the beak      103a of the dispensing head 103, where it has a curved shape allowing it      to conform to the shape of the beak 103a. The support 113 also carries an      inner cylindrical skirt 113c having an inner diameter equal, save for the      necessary clearance, to the outer diameter of the portion 110b of the      hollow piston 110. A circular opening 113d having a diameter equal, save      for the necessary clearance, to the outer diameter of the portion 110c of      the hollow piston, is arranged in the support 113. The support 113 bears      with an annular shoulder 113e situated between the opening 113d and the      skirt 113c on the shoulder situated between the portions 110b and 110c of      the hollow piston. It will be seen that the head 103 is movable in      rotation round the hollow piston 110. </PAR><PAR>  The unit illustrated in FIG. 3 functions as follows. When the user wishes      to dispense the product contained in the bottle 102, he causes the head      103 to swivel round the portion 110c of the hollow piston 110 until the      cut out 114 is opposite the bevel 112c arranged at the edge of the opening      112b of the strip 112, which allows the duct 109 to communicate with      radial groove 111c of the seat 111. The user then presses on the outer      surface (the top one in FIG. 3) of the part 111 comprising the seat. The      part 103 is lowered, the piston compresses the spring 107 and the skirt      113b slides on the portion 105c of the outer cover cap 105 and the ball      108 closes the duct 106b. The product contained in the element 106 and in      the internal duct 109 of the piston 110 is pushed towards the closing      system F. The lip 112a of the beak of the strip 112 moves away from the      seat 111e and the product is dispensed. When the user stops pressing, the      dispensing head 103 rises again under the action of the spring 107, and      under the effect of the vacuum that has been formed, the ball 108 rises,      releasing the duct 106b and a fresh quantity of the product penetrates      into the cylindrical-conical element 106. This fresh quantity will be      dispensed when the user exerts renewed pressure on the part comprising the      seat 111e. It will be seen that the closing system F replaces the second      ball generally used in the pump systems to prevent the intake of air. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 represents a dispensing head generally designated 203 comprising a      part 204 including the seat of the closing system, a strip 205 made of a      resilient material comprising the lip of the closing system, and a cover      206 performing the function of the constraining element. The strip 205 is      provided with a groove 205a wherein a rib 206a of the cover is fitted.      Thus the strip 205 is stiffened, which allows the lip formed by its      bevelled end to come more readily into contact with the seat located      opposite it. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 represents another dispensing head generally designated 303 wherein      the cover has a shape allowing the lip to be applied to the seat, and to      facilitate the return of the lip of the closing system in accordance with      the invention into its rest position in leakprof contact with the seat.      The strip 305 rests on a part 304 comprising the seat. The strip 305      contains an end portion substantially in the shape of a right angled      triangle when viewed in longitudinal section, whereof one side 305a is      perpendicular to the general plane of the strip. The dispensing head 303      comprises a cover 306 parallel to the strip 305, that is provided with a      turn 306a perpendicular to the general plane of the cover 306, and      therefore to the strip 305 and which bears on the side 305a of the strip      305, thus applying the lip carried by the strip 305 to the seat-forming      portion of the part 304 disposed opposite it. Moreover, the strip 305 is      thus partly stiffened, which allows the lip to return more readily into      contact with the seat. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6 and 7 represent a dispensing head generally designated 403,      comprising an air intake. The dispensing head comprises a support 404, a      strip 405 carrying: the lip 405a of the closing system F and the air      intake valve 409, a part 406 comprising the seat 406a also serving as an      element holding the strip 405 in place, and a cover cap 410 intended to      lock the closing device F and the air intake valve 409. </PAR><PAR>  The support 404 comprises a cylindrical skirt 411, which in the embodiment      represented in FIG. 7 is fixed by screwing onto the neck of a bottle (not      represented). Perpendicular to the skirt 411 is fixed a generally flat      disc 414 carrying a thickened portion 414a situated directly below the      closing device F, and having a cross-section in the shape of a right      angled trapezium whose slanting side is turned towards the bottle and      towards the inside of the dispensing head 403. A duct 412 integral with      the disc 414 opens at the level of the slanting side and communicates with      a dip tube 413. The disc 414 is also provided with a circular opening      414c. The strip 405 made of a resilient material comprises a lip 405a      formed by its bevelled end that rests on the seat 406a constituted by the      edge of the part 406. </PAR><PAR>  A channel 414b delimited by the part 406 forming the seat and the thickened      portion 414c on the one hand, and the bevel of the strip 405 on the other      hand, causes the duct 412 to communicate with the closing system F      constituted by the lip 405a of the strip 405 and the seat 406a of the part      406. It may be noted that in the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7, the closing      system F is not situated in a lateral beak but on the top of the      dispensing head 403, the dispensing channel slanting in relation to the      longitudinal axis of the unit. After the part comprising the bevel-shaped      end the thickness of the strip 405 decreases, forming a shoulder 405b, and      it carries in this thinner part a cup-shaped valve 409 whose top is turned      towards the bottle and which is slit on its lateral wall 409a. The strip      405 is covered by the part 406 comprising the seat which is secured by      being fitted on the support 404 and comprises a turn 406b bearing against      the shoulder 405b. The part 406 comprising the seat 406a is provided with      two openings, one for the closing device F in accordance with the      invention and another for the valve 409. The dispensing head 403 is      protected by a cover cap 410 fitted on the support 404 and fixed to the      latter by a film hinge 410a. The face of the cover cap nearer the      dispensing head is provided with two bosses, the one 410b ensuring the      protection and the locking of the closing system F and the other 410c      locking the air intake valve 409. </PAR><PAR>  The device functions as follows: the user raises the cover cap 410 and then      he actuates the dispensing head 403 by squeezing the flexible bottle. The      product passes through the dip tube 413, then into the duct 412 and into      the channel 414b. The lip 405a of the strip 405 moves away from the seat      406a and the product is dispensed. The wall 406b of the part 406      comprising the seat bearing on the wall 405b of the strip, tends to apply      the lip 405a to the seat 406a and facilitates the return of the lip 405a      into its rest position. When the user stops the dispensing, the edge of      the lip 405a of the strip 405 returns to come to bear in a leakproof      manner on the edge 406a, under the effect of the vacuum formed after a      dose of the product has been dispensed, the lips of the slit 409a of the      valve 409 diverge and air enters into the bottle. To finish, the user      closes down the cover cap 410. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 illustrates a dispensing head with a lateral beak generally      designated 803, comprising a cup-shaped valve 809 arranged in the strip      805, this strip 805 resting on a part 804 comprising the seat and being      covered by a cover 806. This dispensing head 806 is not protected by a      cover cap but the cover 806 is partly movable in rotation round a film      hinge so as to allow the access to the air intake valve 809 to be opened      or closed. The cover 806 serves at the same time as a constraining element      and as an element for locking the air intake valve. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 schematically represents a unit 601 for dispensing a mixture of a      pasty product B stored in a bottle 602 with a follower piston 602b and of      a tracing product A that is also pasty contained in a dispensing head 603      comprising a lateral beak 603a wherein the closing system F is disposed      (the lip of the strip 605 and a flat surface forming the seat of the part      604). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 represents the part forming the seat of a dispensing head for the      simultaneous diffusion of two products, wherein two parallel channels are      arranged. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 represents the strip 705 of resilient material and the part 704      comprising the seat in a dispensing head 703 comprising a lateral beak.

The disc 942 carries a      parallelepiped finger 944 with a rectangular cross section centered on the      axis of symmetry of the dispensing head 903 in the extension of the      partition 928. The finger 944 carries on its faces disposed symmetrically      in relation to the partition 928, two grooves 945a and 945b forming      together with the glove finger 905, the outlet ducts 941a and 941b for      each one of the products A and B. These outlet ducts terminate before the      end of the finger 944 providing flat surfaces 945c and 945d which      respectively form parts of the closing devices Fa and Fb in the ducts 941a      and 941 b. </PAR><PAR>  The finger 944 preferably comprises on the faces on the opposite side to      those carrying the grooves, two longitudinal grooves (not shown) intended      to cooperate with corresponding grooves (not shown) of the glove finger      905 to facilitate its mounting. The glove finger 905 is fitted on the      finger 944 of the part 904 comprising the seat. It includes an annular      flange 951 resting on the flange 942 of the seat and has an outer diameter      equal to the inner diameter of the neck 923 of the tube 902. The flange      951 is extended in a smaller diameter cylindrical portion 952 connected to      a still smaller diameter cylindrical portion 954, by a frustoconical      portion 953. The glove finger 905 terminates in a bevelled end fitting 955      forming the lips. Within the glove finger 905 is an internal duct assuming      the shape of the finger 944. This duct comprises two flat surfaces 956a      and 956b bearing on the faces of the finger 944 provided with grooves 945a      and 945b. The end of each of these flat surfaces corresponding to the end      of the bevelled end fitting 955 forming the lips, cooperates with the flat      surfaces 945c and 945d of the seat to form the respective closing devices      Fa and Fb in accordance with the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The cap 906 is formed by a cylindrical-conical skirt 961 whose inner side      bears on the outer side of the portions 952, 953 and 954 of the glove      finger 905. The conical portion of the outer side of the skirt 961 lies in      the extension of the bevelled end fitting 955 forming the lips. The cap      906 comprises a second outer skirt 962 provided on its inside with a bead      963 cooperating by catch engagement with the bead 925 of the neck 923 of      the tube. </PAR><PAR>  The dispensing head 903 is covered, as shown in FIG. 13, by a cover cap 907      which comprises a top 971 and a cylindrical skirt 972. The edge of the      skirt 972 carries on its inside a thread 973 cooperating with the male      thread 924 of the neck 923 of the tube 902 for fixing the compartment 907      on the neck 923 of the tube 902 by screwing. The top 971 of the cover cap      carries an internal skirt 974 whose inner side assumes the shape of the      outer side of the bevelled end fitting 955 forming the lip of the glove      finger 905. This skirt protects the closing system Fa and Fb during      storage and prevents the lips 955 from being accidentally moved away from      each other. </PAR><PAR>  This device functions as follows. When the user wishes to dispense the two      products contained in the tube, he presses on either side of the tube      perpendicularly to the partition 920. The product A, for example, passes      under the action of this pressure into the duct 943a and then into the      channel 941a. In the vicinity of the flat surface 945c it moves aside the      lip formed by the bevelled end 955 of the elastic glove finger 905, by      bending it. The closing device Fa is opened and the product is dispensed.      When the user stops pressing on the tube, the lip returns by elasticity on      to its seat formed by the flat surface 945d. The closing device Fa is      closed in a leakproof manner and air can no longer penetrate into the      compartment 927a. The procedure for dispensing the product B is identical.      To finish, the user secures the cover cap 907 on the tube to cover the      dispensing head. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIGS. 14 and 14a, the dispensing unit is      designated by 1001. The unit is more particularly intended for the      dispensing of products in the form of single, or sample doses. </PAR><PAR>  In this unit the dispensing head and the container are integrated. The unit      is constituted by a rigid part 1004 comprising the seat 1004a of the      closing system F, by a strip 1005 carrying the lip 1005a of the system F,      and by a cover 1006 forming the constraining element, the strip 1005 being      sandwiched between the part comprising the seat 1004 and the cover 1006.      The system F is protected by a frangible small plate 1007. </PAR><PAR>  The unit has the aspect of a casing comprising a rectangular portion 1001a      constituting in essence the part forming the container and a trapezoidal      portion 1001b constituting in essence the part forming the dispensing      head. </PAR><PAR>  The part 1004 comprising the seat is formed by a plate of plastic material      provided in its trapezoidal portion with a channel 1004c ending in a slope      1004b, the part 1004 ending in a flat surface 1004a which constitutes the      seat of the closing system F. </PAR><PAR>  In its trapezoidal portion, the strip 1005 terminates in a bevel so as to      form a lip 1005a which cooperates with the seat 1004a in the closing      system F. In the illustrated embodiment the lip 1005a is extended beyond      the seat 1004a to form a spatula facilitating the application of the      dispensed product. </PAR><PAR>  In the region of the square portion 1001a of the unit 1001, the strip 1005      forms a dome 1005b which defines a chamber 1002 forming a container for      the product above the part 1004 comprising the seat 1004a. </PAR><PAR>  The cover is provided with an opening 1006a surrounded by a crown 1006b      through which the dome 1005b is accessible. In the trapezoidal portion, it      ends in a slanted partition 1006c which cooperates with a corresponding      slanting partition of a thickened portion 1005c of the strip 1005 so as to      bear on the lip 1005a on the seat 1004a. </PAR><PAR>  The plate 1007 for locking the closing system F is a plate made of a      plastic material comprising in its thickness a cut out 1071 into which the      lip 1005a penetrates. The lower side 1072 of this cut out is welded by a      self-breaking weld to the part 1004 at the level of the seat 1004a and the      upper side 1073, which is thin and has a degree of elasticity, comes to      grip the strip 1005. </PAR><PAR>  When the user wishes to dispense the product, he raises the plate 1007 by      turning it to break the weld between the side 1071 and the part 1004, and      then he releases the lip 1005a. To dispense the product, he presses on the      resilient dome 1005b. Under the exerted pressure, the product emerges from      the chamber 1002 and passes through the channel 1004c. The product      subsequently moves the lip 1005a away from the seat 1004a and the product      emerges. </PAR><PAR>  When the user stops pressing on the resilient dome 1005b, the lip 1005a      comes into leakproof contact with the seat 1004a. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 15 to 18 represent dispensing heads comprising a closing system      constituted by a resilient strip resting on a seat which is also      resilient. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIG. 15 the resilient strip 1105, together      with its lip 1105a comprising the seat formed by its bevelled end, rests      on a part 1104 made of a material which is resilient, and is preferably      similar to that of the strip 1105. The seat 1104 is stripshaped and ends      in a bevel 1104a, constituting the substantially symmetrical seat of the      bevel 1105a in relation to the joint of these two strips. </PAR><PAR>  The unit comprising the strip 1105 and the seat-forming part 1104 is      sandwiched between a rigid cover 1107 and a rigid support 1108 forming      constraining elements. In the embodiment represented in FIG. 15, the      dispensing head 1103 comprises a lateral beak 1103a containing the outlet      channel for the product to be dispensed. The channel 1105b is cut in the      strip 1105 and extends as far as the lip 1105a. A duct 1109 passes through      the support 1108 in a direction orthogonal to the median plane of this      support and it is connected to the channel 1105b. On the side remote from      the seat 1104, the support 1108 comprises means 1111 allowing it to be      joined to the neck of a container of the type having follower piston or a      flexible bag. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 shows a variant 1203 of the dispensing head at the lateral outlet      of FIG. 15. The dispensing head comprises a strip 1205 provided with a lip      1205a and a flexible part 1204 including the seat sandwiched between a      support 1208 and a cover 1207 forming constraining elements. The strip      1205 is the same as the strip 1105 of FIG. 15, but the part 1204 including      the seat 1204a comprises a longitudinal cut out 1210 which extends as far      as a lip 1204a identical with the lip 1105a of the strip 1105, the seat      1204a being symmetrical with the lip 1205a in relation to the plane of the      joint. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIG. 16, a rigid or semi-rigid wall      forming a partial stiffener, is disposed in the cut out 1210. This wall      1212 extends substantially from the outer contour of the duct 1209 passing      through the support 1208 as far as the lip 1204a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 represents a dispensing head 1303 comprising, like the one      represented in FIG. 16, a strip 1305 and a resilient support 1304      comprising the seat 1304a separated by a stiffener 1312 but arranged to      form an outlet for the product along the axial direction of the container      1302. The strip 1305 and the resilient support 1304 are provided at their      ends respectively with a lip 1305a and a seat 1304a and they are      symmetrical in relation to the plane of their joint, this joint plane, in      the illustrated embodiment, passing through the axis of the container      1302. The wall 1312 forming the stiffener is disposed between the strip      1305 and the part 1304 forming the seat 1304a. It is provided with two      symmetrical channels 1312a and 1312b. The product emerges from the      container 1302 through an opening 1314 whose diameter is sufficient to      allow the product to enter on either side of the wall 1312 into the      channel 1312a and 1312b towards the lip 1305a and the seat 1304a and the      outlet slot. </PAR><PAR>  The strip 1305 and the part 1304 comprising the seat comprise in their      lower portions a radially outwardly extending rim 1315 capable of being      gripped by the lower edge of a sleeve 1316 provided in a rigid shell 1317      surrounding the strip 1305 and by the part comprising the seat 1304 and      ensuring the mounting on the neck of the container 1302 by catch      engagement. The rigid shell 1317 constitutes the constraining element. It      comprises a roof-shaped upper end 1318 which comes to hold the strip 1305      and the seat 1304 at the base of the freely projecting lips 1305a and      1304a of this shell 1317. It should be noted that the strip 1305 and the      part 1304 comprising the seat may form two separate parts or a single      part. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 represents a variant of the dispensing head represented in FIG. 13.      The dispensing head 1403 comprises a glove finger 1405 which is fitted on      a support in the shape of a parallelepiped finger 1404 with a rectangular      cross-section so as to form two symmetrical closing systems Fa and Fb for      the outlets of the products A and B respectively. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIG. 18, the cap 1406 holding the exterior      of the glove finger 1405 comprises a cylindrical skirt 1461, provided in      its upper portion with a bead inserted in a corresponding circular groove      of the strip 1405 near the start of the bevel 1405 of the strip. This      skirt carries a male screw thread carrying a constricting ring 1407. By      screwing this ring, it can be displaced between a low position where it      locks the strip 1405 and a high &quot;in-use&quot; position (represented in dots and      dashes in FIG. 18) where the strip 1405 is released. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 19 and 20 show a dispensing head 1603 with a lateral beak comprising      a strip 1605 sandwiched between a rigid part 1604 including the seat and a      cover 1606 forming a constraining element. A rectangular opening 1661 is      arranged on the cover 1606, which opening is disposed symmetrically in      relation to the median plane of the strip and extends from the limit of      the bevel 1605a of the strip 1605 diametrically up to the vicinity of the      edge of the lid on the side remote from the beak 1603a of the dispensing      head 1603. In this opening, there may slide, along the double arrow f, a      tongue 1607 which modifies according to its position the flexibility of      the lip of the strip 1605 so as to regulate the pressure of the product      necessary for opening the closing system. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 21a to 21c schematically represent a dispensing head 1703 with a      lateral beak 1702a comprising a strip 1705 with a bevelled end 1705a      resting on a part comprising the seat and held in position by a cover 1706      forming the constraining element. The lip 1705a of the strip may be held      in position during storage by means of a locking device constituted by a      stirrup 1707 made of a fixed semi-rigid material pivoting by the catch      engagement of its two lateral arms 1771 on two pins 1772 and provided on      the transverse bar with a stud 1773 disposed in the region of the closing      system F. In the storage position, the stirrup 1707 is in the position      represented in FIGS. 21a and 21b. FIG. 21c represents the stirrup 1707 in      dots and dashes as it is being unlocked, and in the rest position in solid      lines, after having been unlocked. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 22a to 22c schematically represent a dispensing head 1803 with a      lateral beak forming a pump comprising a push button and a stirrup 1807      for locking the strip 1805 of the closing system F. The stirrup 1807 is      pivotal about a point near the centre of its arms 1871, by being fixed on      two pivot pins 1872 carried by the push button 1808. The transverse bar of      the stirrup is provided with an enlarged portion 1879, one edge of which      carries the stud 1873 and forms a slightly curved surface forming an angle      with the arms of the stirrup. The stirrup 1807 swings between a position      represented in FIG. 22a where it locks the closing system by means of the      stud 1873 and, through the intermediate position represented in FIG. 22b,      to a position represented in FIG. 22c where the stirrup 1807 rests with a      portion of its enlarged surface 1879 on the upper surface of the push      button and is locked by a pin 1874 carried by a fixed tab integral with      the container 1809. The stirrup may then be used as a lever for bearing on      the push button 1808. By pressing on the curved side of the enlarged      portion 1873, the user obtains a gearing down of the pressure force      exerted on the push button 1808. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 23a and 23b represent an embodiment of a dispensing head 1903 with a      lateral beak 1903a forming a pump. The dispensing head 1903 comprises a      part 1904 comprising the seat 1904d provided with a beak 1904a. In the      part 1904, there is cut a radial channel 1904b which extends in the beak      1904a and terminates in the region of the bead comprising a flat surface      constituting the seat 1904d. The part 1904 comprising the seat is provided      with an outer skirt 1941 arranged so as to be capable of being mounted on      the container (not shown) and an inner skirt 1942 whose side is locally      identical with that of the skirt 1941 which defines a duct 1909      communicating the container with the channel 1904b. This duct 1909      contains a ball valve 1913 in which the ball is held on the side nearer      the dispensing head. The strip 1905 made of a resilient material rests on      the part 1904 forming the seat, and comprises a bevelled portion 1905a      whose lip cooperates with the surface 1904d of the support to form the      closing system F in accordance with the invention. After the bevelled      portion 1905a, the strip 1905 has a reduced thickness, and opposite the      duct 1909 it has a cup-shaped portion 1951 whose side wall comprises an      annular step 1952 forming a bellows and whose top is hollowed out by a      partly spherical cavity 1953. The strip 1905 is surmounted by a cover 1906      fixed on the support 1904, except in the region of the end of the beak      1903a, and which comprises an inner skirt 1961 whose bottom edge bears on      the portion with a reduced thickness of the strip 1905 and against the      side of the bevel 1905a. There is a circular opening 1962 in the cover      1906, situated opposite the cup-shaped portion 1951 of the strip, and      having a diameter larger than the maximum diameter of the part 1951 at its      base. A push button 1910 is placed in the opening 1962. It comprises a      dome 1914 connected to a flange 1912. The flange 1912 is applied against      the inner side of the cover 1906 by means of a spring 1914 which is      mounted round the cup 1951 and bears on the one hand against the flange      1912 and on the other hand, against the reduced thickness portion of the      strip 1905. The dome 1912 carries at its centre, a stem 1911a, having a      sphere 1911b fixed at its end. This sphere 1911b comes to be inserted into      the cavity 1953 of the cup-shaped portion 1951 of the strip 1905. </PAR><PAR>  The device functions as described below. When the user wishes to dispense      some of the product, he depresses the dome 1911 by compressing the spring      1914. The cup-shaped portion 1951 is deformed and its internal volume E      decreases. The ball valve 1913 is closed. The pressure of the product      contained in the space E and the channel 1904b causes the closing system F      to open and the product is dispensed. When the user relaxes his pressure      on the dome 1911, the spring returns the flange 1912 to bear against the      cover 1906; the cup-shaped portion 1951 reassumes its shape by elasticity;      and the internal space E increases while producing low pressure.      Simultaneously, the closing system F is closed in a leakproof manner. The      low pressure in the internal space E causes the ball valve 1913 to open      and the product to be drawn up from the container into the internal space      E. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 24 represents a variant of the piston system represented in FIGS. 23a      and 23b. The dispensing head 2003 comprises a part 2004 comprising the      seat whereon there rests a strip 2005 surmounted by a cover 2006. The part      2004 comprising the seat is similar to the part comprising the seat of      FIG. 23a. It comprises a duct 2009 causing the container, not shown, to      communicate with the channel 2004c in the part 2004 and containing a ball      valve 2013. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment represented in FIG. 24, the duct 2009 is extended on the      side of the strip 2005. This strip 2005 comprises a bevelled portion 2005a      and a reduced thickness portion which carries a cylindrical skirt 2051      surrounding the extension of the duct 2009. The cover 2006 is provided      with an opening 2062 with a diameter larger than that of the skirt 2051,      in which opening there is mounted a dome 2011 having a flange 2012. A      spring 2014 surrounds the skirt 2051 and bears on the one hand against the      reduced thickness portion of the strip 2005 and on the other hand, against      the flange 2012. At its centre, the dome 2011 carries at the end of a stem      2011a, a piston 2011b capable of sliding in a leakproof manner inside the      extension of the duct 2009 which forms the pump barrel. </PAR><PAR>  To actuate the dispensing head 2003 the user presses on the dome 2011, and      the piston 2011b advances while reducing the internal space E of the      extension of the duct 2009 forming the pump barrel. The rest of the      functioning of the apparatus is then similar to that described with      reference to FIGS. 23a and 23b. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 25a schematically represents a dispensing unit 2101 wherein the      product to be dispensed is contained in a flexible bag 2102 protected by a      rigid shell 2110 provided with an air intake opening 2110a. The dispensing      head 2103 is of the type having a lateral outlet provided with a beak      2103a and forms a pump. The head 2103 comprises a part 2104 comprising the      seat whereon the flexible bag 2102 is mounted and which is fixed on the      edge of the rigid shell 2110. A strip 2105 is positioned on the part 2104      comprising the seat and it is held in position by a cover 2106. The part      2104 comprising the seat is constituted by a plate 2141 perpendicular to      the longitudinal axis of the unit 2101 having the general shape of a disc      provided with a beak. At the end of the beak, the part 2104 comprises a      bead 2104a having a slanting flat surface 2104d forming the seat facing      the axis of the unit and facing the container. It comprises a cylindrical      skirt facing the cover 2142 which surrounds the strip except in the region      of the end of the beak 2103a, and an upwardly facing skirt 2143 to which      the flexible tube is welded. The part is pierced near its axis by a      circular opening 2144 whereon is mounted a cup type of nonreturn valve      which is constituted by a valve 2113 illustrated in greater detail in FIG.      25b. This cup valve consists of two capsules 2114 and 2115, the lower      capsule 2114 being made of a relatively rigid plastic material and the      capsule 2115 being relatively flexible so as to be capable of deformation.      The two capsules are fixed to each other by nesting. The two capsules 2114      and 2115 are each provided with a skirt 2116 and 2117 which face each      other while forming a leakproof seal, and are capable of sliding on each      other until they separate, leaving a gap between them during the      deformation of the capsule 2115. The capsules 2114 and 2115 have openings      2118 and 2119 respectively which can only communicate with each other when      the skirts 2116 and 2117 are separated. In the beak 2103a, the strip 2105      comprises a bevelled portion 2105a which bears in a leakproof manner on      the surface 2104d forming the seat and a dome-shaped portion 2111 with a      reduced thickness, the dome having at its base a diameter larger than that      of the cup valve 2113. Between the dome 2111 and the closing system F, the      strip 2105 is provided with a channel 2105b. The cover 2106 covers the      strip except in its portion corresponding to the closing system F and it      is provided at its centre with a circular opening 2161 through which the      dome 2111 projects outwardly. </PAR><PAR>  The device of FIG. 25a functions in the way described below. When the user      wishes to dispense the product contained in the flexible tube 2102 he      presses on the resilient dome 2111, which decreases the internal space E      contained under the dome 2111, the valve 2113 being closed. The product      contained in the space E and in the channel 2105b is subjected to excess      pressure and opens the closing system F. When the user stops pressing on      the dome 2111 the closing system F closes again and the dome reassumes its      shape by elasticity, which causes a low pressure to be formed in the      internal space E. The valve 2113 opens and some product is transferred      from the flexible tube 2102 into the space E. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 26a to 26c represent a unit 2201 in accordance with the invention      serving as a comb for the application of a hair product. The handle of the      comb is formed by a rigid shell 2210 provided with an air intake opening      2210a and containing a flexible bag 2202. On the comb handle (the rigid      shell 2210 and the flexible bag 2202), is mounted a dispensing head 2203      having a conical shape with an oval cross-section and provided with teeth      2245. In the remainder of the description, the unit 21 will be considered      as being disposed horizontally, as represented in FIGS. 26a and 26b. The      dispensing head 2203 consists of a part 2204 comprising the seat, carrying      on each side a row of horizontal teeth 2245. A resilient strip 2205      resting on the support 2204 is protected by a shell 2206 which forms the      constraining element disposed on the strip 2205 and is welded at its      periphery to the edge of the support 2204. The support 2204 contains a      vertical disc 2241 which closes the rigid shell 2210. This disc 2241      carries a skirt 2242 fitted in the rigid shell and serves to fix the      flexible bag 2202 whose edge is gripped between the skirt 2242 and the      inner side of the rigid shell 2210. On the side remote from the skirt      2242, the disc 2241 carries an eccentric duct 2243 which is cut at its top      on the side nearer the handle 2206 to allow the strip 2205 to be fixed      between the part 2204 and the shell 2206. The duct 2243 is hollowed out at      its bottom below the strip 2205 by a parallelepiped hole having, at its      side nearer the handle, a vertical partition 2244a. The duct 2243 is      extended at its lower portion in a shell 2246 which is provided along its      axis of symmetry with a delivery channel 2247 for the product, as may be      seen in FIG. 26c. In the region of the teeth 2245 of the part 2204, the      lateral edges of the strip 2205 form respective bevels 2205a and 2205b      which rest on the symmetrical edges of the shell 2246 forming the seat.      Therefore, the edges of the shell 2246 and the lips of the bevels 2205a      and 2205b of the strip 2205 respectively form the lips and the seats of      the closing system Fa and Fb in accordance with the invention. In the      region of the teeth 2245 of the comb, this strip carries a groove 2253      disposed on the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the strip. Just after the      mounting zone between the cover and the cut out of the duct 2243, the      strip forms a dome 2251, a space E being arranged between this dome 2251      and the shell 2246. Moreover, at the level of the duct 2243, the strip      2205 carries a stud 2252 turned towards the part 2204 which rests on the      partition 2244a situated on the handle side of the cavity 2244 of the part      2204. The partition 2244a forms the seat for the lip closed by the stud      2252 and the combination of the partition and the lip constitutes a valve      Fc. The cover 2206 is fixed by welding or catch engagement on the edge of      the support 2204, except in the region of the closing systems Fa and Fb      where the cover 2206 comprises two cut outs 2261a and 2261b for the bevels      2205a and 2205b of the strip 2205. The cover 2206 is provided with a rib      2263 complementary to the rib 2253 of the strip. The cover 2206 is pierced      by a circular opening 2262 through which the dome 2251 projects. </PAR><PAR>  The device functions in the manner described below. When the user wishes to      dispense some of the product, he takes the comb by the handle formed by      the rigid shell 2210 and he presses on the dome 2251. He thus causes the      space E to be reduced and since the valve Fc is closed, he produces excess      pressure on the product contained in this space. Under the pressure of the      product, the lips 2205a and 2205b move away from the seat formed by the      edge of the shell 2204, and the closing systems Fa and Fb are opened. The      product is dispensed on to the teeth of the comb 2245. </PAR><PAR>  When the user stops pressing on the dome 2251 the closing system Fa and Fb      close again, the lips 2205a and 2205b return to the seat formed by the      edge of the shell 2204, and the dome 2251 reassumes its natural shape by      elasticity which produces low pressure in the space E. The valve Fc opens,      the stud 2252 moving away from the partition 2244a, and the product      contained in the flexible tube 2202 is drawn up into the space E through      the duct 2243. Simultaneously, the user can distribute the dispensed      product on the head of hair by means of the comb. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 27 shows a unit 2301 in accordance with the invention, with its      dispensing head 2303 comprising a lateral beak 2303a and forming a pump.      The push button 2308 actuates the piston and is accessible from the side.      A flexible bag 2302 is welded on to the dispensing head 2303 and is      protected by a rigid shell 2310 provided with an air intake opening 2310a.      In the dispensing head 2303, the seat-defining part 2304 and the cover      2306 together define an internal space E forming a piston body which is      disposed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shell 2310. A      lateral push button 2308 mounted on a spring 2314 carries a piston 2381      capable of sliding horizontally in the piston body as represented in FIG.      27. The space E is connected to the flexible bag 2302 by a ball valve 2313      and connected to the outside by a channel 2304c to a closing system F      whose seat is formed by the surface 2304d of the part 2304 on which the      lip 2305a of a resilient strip 2305 rests. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 28 and 29 represent dispensing heads according to the second      embodiment of the invention wherein the obturator is a resilient part      disposed opposite the outlet of the dispensing duct and which moves away      from the seat in a direction parallel to the pressure of the liquid to be      dispensed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 28 represents a dispensing head 2403 with a lateral outlet. The      dispensing head 2403 is formed by a part 2404 comprising the seat 2442 and      made of a plastic material, pierced by a dispensing duct 2441 bent at      right angles which opens in an annular groove 2442 whose cross-section has      the shape of a segment of a circle. A toric part 2405 made of a flexible      material is fitted in the groove, which part surrounds the dispensing head      2403. At the outlet level of the dispensing duct, in the groove 2442, the      toric part 2405 forms the obturator and the groove 2442 forms the seat.      Opposite the outlet of the dispensing duct 2441, the toric part 2405 is      provided with a delivery duct 2451 which communicates with the dispensing      duct and has a shape such that it can direct the flow of the dispensed      product upwards (in FIG. 28). Below the outlet of the dispensing duct (in      FIG. 28), the torus 2405 is provided with a stud 2452 fitted in a      corresponding groove of the part 2404 and which constitutes the      constraining element. In FIG. 28, the dispensing head 2403 is represented      in the rest position, the toric part being fitted in the groove 2442 so      that the delivery duct 2451 is closed. When some of the product to be      dispensed penetrates along arrow f1 into the dispensing duct 2441 and then      into the delivery duct 2451, it presses at this level on the torus 2405      which becomes deformed by elasticity and the portion situated opposite the      outlet of the duct 2441 is displaced along arrow f2 until this      displacement is sufficient for the delivery duct 2451 to communicate with      the outside. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 29 schematically represents a dispensing unit 2501 whose dispensing      head 2503 forms a pump because it includes two valves. The dispensing unit      2501 comprises a flexible bag 2502 protected by a rigid shell 2510      provided with an air intake opening 2510a. The dispensing head comprises      firstly, a part 2504 comprising the seat, secondly a toric part 2505      integrally moulded with a flexible strip forming a dome 2507 and carrying      a stud 2508 forming a part of a second valve 2513 and, thirdly a cover      2506. The part 2504 comprising the seat has the general shape of a disc      fixed to the upper edge of the rigid shell 2510 and it is provided with an      inner cylindrical skirt 2541 to which the flexible bag 2502 is welded.      Over a portion of its periphery, it is provided with a groove 2542 having      the cross-sectional shape of a circular segment into which there issues a      radial duct 2543 in the part 2504. At a point diametrically opposite the      outlet of the duct 2543, the part 2504 has a duct 2544 parallel to the      longitudinal axis of the unit 2501 which issues in the flexible bag 2502      at one end and communicates with a cut out 2545 of the part 2504 separated      from the duct 2544 by a partition 2546 parallel to the axis of the unit      2501 whose upper edge is bevelled. </PAR><PAR>  In cross-section, the toric seal 2505 is circular, provided with a stud      2552 in the region of the closing system, and it is fitted into the groove      2542. The dome 2507 is situated above the support 2504 and it defines,      above the support 2504, an internal space E which communicates on the one      hand with the duct 2543 and on the other hand, with the cut out 2545. The      base of the dome 2507 is extended, on the side remote from the opening of      the duct 2543, in a plate carrying a stud 2508 that cooperates with the      partition 2546 to form a valve 2513. In this valve 2513, the stud 2508      rests in a leakproof manner on the surface of the edge of the partition      2546. The cover 2506 is fixed to the periphery of the support 2504 and it      is provided with an opening 2561 through which the dome 2507 projects. At      the level of the torus 2505, the cover 2506 is cut by a groove 2562 having      the cross-sectional shape of a circular segment, which is fitted to the      groove 2542 to form together therewith (in cross section) a larger      circular segment. At the level of the outlet of the dispensing duct 2543,      and above it, the groove 2562 and a fraction of the groove 2542 are      provided with a delivery duct 2509 for the product. </PAR><PAR>  The unit 2501 functions as follows. When the user wishes to dispense the      product, he presses on the resilient dome 2507 and reduces the internal      space E since the valve 2513 is closed. The product contained in the space      E is subjected to excess pressure and exerts pressure via the duct 2543 on      the torus 2505 to displace it by elasticity in the direction of arrow f2,      thereby opening the delivery duct 2509 towards the outside. The product is      dispensed. When the user stops pressing on the elastic dome 2511 the      pressure of the product to be dispensed, on the torus 2505, stops and the      torus reassumes its position by elasticity and closes the duct 2509. Since      the dome reassumes its shape by elasticity, low pressure is generated in      the space E. This low pressure causes the valve 2513 to open, the stud      2508 moving away by being bent from the edge of the partition 2546. Some      of the product contained in the bag 2502 is drawn up into the space E via      the duct 2544 and the cut out 2545. The dispensing head is ready for a      fresh dispensing of the product. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I/WE claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
