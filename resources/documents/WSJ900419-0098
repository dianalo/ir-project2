Having lived most of my life in thisutopia, &quot;the most perfect of all systems,&quot; as our domesticsocial democrats love to describe it, I take a somewhatdifferent position. . . . In our countries people are growingdisillusioned, and no longer believe the welfare state candeliver what it promised. At the same time, the moral hazardsof the system are beginning to show. The Scandinavian welfarestate has little to offer either East or West. Do not adopt amodel we are moving away from.   ---   From a posthumous book by former university professor W.W.Bartley III, &quot;Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth,&quot; to bepublished by Open Court Press this year:                                                                                                          For certain kinds of groups, universities are handy placesin which to have a strong redoubt. They are handy for groupsthat are not competitive, that are peddling ideas for whichthere is little demand, ideas that do not work, that fail toexplain, and whose proponents are consciously orunconsciously tempted to turn them into ideologies in orderto perpetuate themselves or further the groups to which theybelong.</TEXT></DOC>
