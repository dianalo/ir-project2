The memo was released yesterday by theDepartment. &quot;It is more likely that the correctedapportionment based on an adjusted count would be closer tothe truth than further from the truth.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mosbacher announced Monday that the 1990 censuswouldn't be adjusted, largely because he believed an adjustedcensus would be less accurate at the local level.   If Mr. Mosbacher had decided in favor of adjustment,California and Arizona, which under the unadjusted censuswill gain seven and one congressional seats, respectively,would probably have gained one additional seat each.Pennsylvania, which is to lose one seat, and Wisconsin, whichisn't to gain or lose, would have each lost one additionalseat.   Ms. Bryant said on Monday that she had recommended anadjustment largely as a means of correcting the CensusBureau's undercount of minorities. She didn't address theissue of congressional reapportionment at that time.</TEXT></DOC>
