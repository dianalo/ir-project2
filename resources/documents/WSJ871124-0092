The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld rulings by federal district Judge Milton Pollack in a case involving trading in the securities of St. Joe Minerals Corp. in 1981 just prior to a takeover bid launched by Seagram Co.    In 1986, Judge Pollack found two Italian investment bankers guilty in an insider-trading case, as well as three Panamanian investment companies controlled by one defendant, Giuseppe B. Tome, and an Italian company owned by the other, Paolo Mario Leati.    The two men didn't appear at the U.S. trial and in their appeal asserted they hadn't properly been served with the charges. Originally, the Securities and Exchange Commission complaint only named &quot;certain purchasers&quot; of St. Joe options as defendants, but later the names were obtained from a Swiss bank. They subsequently were added to the complaint. The appeals court said the two men &quot;made a conscious decision&quot; to ignore the proceeding until after a judgment had been rendered against them.    Judge Pollack also had ordered the defendants to disgorge more than $2.7 million in profits from the illegal insider trading. The Panamanian companies appealed, asserting that the disgorgement order was improper.    The companies argued that disgorgement is designed to provide restitution for specific victims of illegal behavior, but the appeals court said &quot;whether or not any investors may be entitled to money damages is immaterial.&quot; The purpose, the court added, is to &quot;make sure that wrongdoers will not profit from their wrongdoing.&quot;    SEC attorneys said the ruling affirmed its ability to initially charge unknown purchasers in an insider-trading case. </TEXT></DOC>
