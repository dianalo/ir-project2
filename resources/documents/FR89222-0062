The categories ofrecords have been changed to include writing samples and documents relatingto an applicant's suitability or eligibility which may, in some instances,be retained in an applicant's records. Routine uses have been expandedto include the release of information to a court, magistrate, or administrativetribunal in connection with civil or criminal proceedings, and to the approporiatefederal, state or local agency for investigatory or prosecutorial purposes.It is possible that federal, state, or local authorities may seek suchinformation to fulfill their functions. Retrieval of applicant files isgenerally by name; however, records of unsuccessful applicants are indexedfirst by the year and job position applied for, then by an individual'sname. For example, applications of unsuccessful candidates for the positionof legal intern during 1986 would be filed together under the legal interncategory for that year. The change in indexing was made to conform to therecently revised filing system for the Legal Division. The retention anddisposal of records has been changed to indicate the records of successfulapplicants become a part of the FDIC's Unofficial Personnal System of Records(FDIC 30-64-0015) and are retained for two years after the successful applicantleaves the employ of the FDIC, in accordance with that system's schedule.Finally, the notification procedure to obtain an individual's records nowrequires that all requests be in writing. This change will bring the systeminto conformity with the standard procedure which will be applied to allFDIC systems of records. As each system is revised, the standard notificationprocedure will be added. In order to assist in a timely search of records,unsuccessful applicants requesting their records are to provide the nameof the job position for which they applied and the year of application.Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes to revise theAttorney_Legal Intern Applicant System to read as follows.<ITAG tagnum="66">FDIC 30-64-0001</ITAG>SYSTEM NAME: Attorney_Legal Intern Applicant System.
