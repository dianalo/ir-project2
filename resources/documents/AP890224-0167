Critics of current policy say banks are discouraged fromrealistically recognizing losses on Third World debt. They say banksshould be permitted to spread the effects of recognizing losses overseveral years. Currently, they must reduce their profit by the fullamount of any addition to loss reserves.   However, the Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said accountingstandards are designed to present a true picture of banks' financialcondition, adding, ``accounting policies ... are not intended toencourage or discourage any actions that management considers to bein the best interest of the institution.''   They cited World Bank estimates showing that $20 billion indeveloping country debt has been eliminated in the past two years.   The three agencies also said that banks' exposure to developingcountry debt had improved considerably since the crisis firstemerged in 1982 but was still large for the nation's 10 biggestbanks.   At the end of September, the 10 largest banks were on the hook todeveloping countries for loans representing 95 percent of the banks'capital and loss reserves.   And, the report endorsed the continuation of the so-called Bakerplan, which rejects taxpayer contributions toward solving theproblem and encourages case-by-case negotiations for additionallending rather than any coordinated plan of debt forgiveness.   The approach is named after Secretary of State James A. BakerIII, who developed while serving as Ronald Reagan's Treasurysecretary.   ``The bank regulatory agencies continue to believe thecase-by-case negotiated approach is the best method,'' the reportsaid.   President Bush has said his administration will take a new lookat the approach, but has advocated no specific changes.   On another point, the report said the secondary market forselling and swapping Third World loans is a poor indicator of theloans' true value. Many analysts say they are worried because theloans are now worth about 40 percent of their original value, downfrom 60 percent in mid-1987. The regulators said secondary marketprices may reflect short-term supply and demand rather than thelong-term value of the loans.   The regulators' report is the first installment toward meetingthe requirements of a section of last year's trade act. A secondreport, due by May 31, will examine the effects of Third Worldlending on bank profits between 1977 and 1987.   The Treasury Department was supposed to deliver another reportthis week on new approaches for solving the debt crisis, but wasgiven a three-week extension.</TEXT></DOC>
