The mishap off the Caribbean coast was Guatemala's worst maritimedisaster.   Late Tuesday, the captain of the ferry, who is charged withnegligent homocide in the case, blamed the navy crew for theaccident during an interview in a National Police jail in this city.   The captain, Juan Pablo Esquivel, said those on the navy ship,which he said included non-navy personnel, were ``celebrating ondeck'' during the towing operation. He said he smelled alcohol onthe breath of a machinist who boarded his packed ferry from the navyvessel to check the motor.   The ferry skipper said that after eight minutes of towing, thenavy vessel ``made a brusque acceleration'' that caused the ferry toflip over.   Capt. Rigoberto Kiste, of the Puerto Barrios naval base, said bytelephone that he could not officially respond to the chargesbecause the navy's investigation was continuing.   But earlier Tuesday, another officer at the local naval basedenied that the patrol vessel, No. 654, was at fault and said theferry captain must shoulder prime responsibility.   A tugboat captain and other witnesses told The Associated Pressthat the ferry was towed with too short a cable and that the patrolboat did not slow down even after the ferry started listing.   ``The wake of the patrol boat was hitting hard against our bow,and our bow was down in the water. You can't keep a ship undercontrol when its bow is down in the water,'' said Ladislao Ponce,47, who has worked for 19 years as a tugboat captain and who was apassenger on the ferry.   Capt. Anibal Giron, second in command at Puerto Barrios navalbase and a graduate of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, remarked:``When people are in grief, when they've suffered loss, they look toaffix blame immediately. Our business is saving lives. We are asupset about this as anyone.''   Giron said the navy was investigating, but the preliminaryconclusion is that Esquivel, the ferry captain, was mainly to blame.   Ponce was traveling with his wife and two daughters Sunday whenthe ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II flipped and sank in Amatique Baywhile making the 16-mile run from Livingston to Puerto Barrios.Ponce's wife and one daughter drowned.   Ponce said the ferry lost power either from lack of fuel orengine trouble and drifted an hour until a naval patrol boat arrivedand offered a tow.   ``The cable they used to tow us was very short, about 15 meters(49 feet) long,'' said Ponce. He and Rodolfo Lucano, anothercommercial captain, said the cable should have been at least 165feet long.   The vessel listed sharply twice, to port then starboard, ``butthey did not reduce speed. They must have seen that we were listingdangerously,'' said Ponce. He said passengers were panicked by thesecond steep tilt.   The vessel flipped over, trapping passengers below.   Rogelio Franzua, an 18-year-old high school student who had beenheaded home to Puerto Barrios, also estimated the length of thetowing cable at 45 feet. He, like Ponce, said no life jackets wereaboard the Rufino Barrios.   ``Both the ferry and the navy have responsibility. Because theferry was overloaded and without needed equipment. And the patrolboat should have taken off at least some of us before beginning totow, and they towed us too fast,'' Franzua said.</TEXT></DOC>
