We can use time-dependent perturbation theory to calculatethe influence of the field on the energy of atoms. When the field isapplied to atoms which are in the ground state initially, the energychange of the atoms shows a linear dependence on time with a constantenergy shift. This constant shift is the usual energy shift of atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
