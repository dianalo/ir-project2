Phillips Petroleum Co. posted a $32 million loss, and Shell Oil Co. reported a 60% decline in earnings for the quarter.    Exxon Corp.   New York-based Exxon reported revenue declined 13% to $19.44 billion in the latest quarter from $22.24 billion a year earlier.    The earnings decline at Exxon -- long the world's most profitable oil company -- had been expected. Industry analysts have been predicting that profits of most oil companies with refining operations would be down for at least a part of this year, with the biggest drop coming in the first quarter. Exxon executives had said in recent interviews that they expected first-quarter results to decline from the strong showing of a year earlier.    For all 1987, analysts' estimates of Exxon's earnings vary widely, in a range of $5.50 to $7.50 a share, compared with last year's $7.42 a share. One analyst expecting Exxon's earnings to decline for the year is Paul Mlotok of Salomon Brothers Inc. who cites a slowdown in refining and marketing earnings only partially offset by anticipated recovery in exploration and production.    In last year's first quarter, petroleum product prices lagged in falling after crude oil prices collapsed. As a result, Exxon's refining margins were exceptionally high for the 1986 period, more than offsetting the effects of the oil-price collapse on other operations.    In reporting the latest results, Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman, cited depressed refining margins. Exxon's U.S. refining and marketing operations had a loss of $38 million in the latest quarter, compared with earnings of $160 million a year earlier, he said. Earnings from foreign refining and marketing operations fell to $74 million from $440 million.    Mr. Rawl also said that, while crude oil prices strengthened toward the end of the quarter, average prices for the period were below those of a year earlier. That led to lower earnings from Exxon's exploration and production operations, he said. Natural gas prices also were lower, particularly in Europe, he said.    As previously indicated, Exxon increased slightly the buyback of its stock in the latest quarter, compared with the final three months of 1986. The company reported that it acquired an additional 5.1 million shares in the latest quarter at a cost of $416 million.    Exxon's capital and exploration expenditures fell sharply in the first quarter, to $986 million from $2.19 billion a year earlier. The 1987 total, however, doesn't reflect expenditures associated with the recently announced $690 million purchase of certain Australian producing interests.    Phillips Petroleum Co.   Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips said its loss -- its first since 1931 -- was largely the result of lower oil, natural gas and gas liquids prices. The company said its average price for oil was just above $16 a barrel during the quarter, compared with about $18.50 a year earlier. Results for the year-earlier quarter also included a $93 million gain from asset sales and a $65 million write-down of assets.    Revenue for the 1987 quarter fell 18%, to $2.54 billion from $3.11 billion last year.    Analysts, who had been expecting Phillips to break even in the quarter or report a small loss, said they were disappointed that the company's domestic exploration and production business showed an operating loss of $7 million at a time when other U.S. exploration operations are turning profitable.    Phillips said its natural gas and gas liquids businesses also showed an operating loss for the quarter, although its foreign exploration business and its chemicals unit were profitable.    In addition, Phillips said it generated $240 million in cash from operations during the quarter. That amount, said Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., should ensure the company's 15-cent dividend for another quarter. The company usually declares a dividend after its annual meeting, which is set for Thursday.    A spokesman said Phillips is hopeful that prices will improve as the year goes on.    Shell Oil Co.   In Houston, the unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group attributed its earnings decline to lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reduced margins in its oil and chemical products businesses.    Revenue dropped 3% to $4.5 billion from $4.67 billion a year earlier.    John Bookout, Shell president, said, &quot;We are cautiously optimistic that, in the months ahead, oil markets will be less volatile than in 1986.&quot; Last year, crude oil prices fell &quot;dramatically&quot; in the first quarter and continued to decline until the middle of the third quarter, he said.    Profit from oil and gas exploration and production dropped 45% in this year's first quarter, to $110 million from $201 million a year earlier. Earnings from oil products fell 86% to $8 million from $61 million, and earnings from chemical products declined 44% to $40 million from $72 million.    Shell said it estimates 1987 capital and exploratory spending will increase about 2% to $2.9 billion from last year's $2.84 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Exxon closed at $86.50, down $2.25, and Phillips finished at $15, off 37.5 cents.    ---                        1987                1986                    in        per       in        per    %                  millions   share    millions   share  chg.
