But economists said rates have to rise further to counter inflationary pressures.    An increase had been widely expected, especially after news Monday that Britain's trade deficit grew to a record #1.71 billion ($2.95 billion) in May while the current-account deficit widened to a record #1.21 billion. The trade data, indicating strong demand for imports, intensified concerns that the British economy was overheating.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday said the trade figures were &quot;very disappointing&quot; and that the interest-rate increase was intended as a sign of her government's determination to fight inflation. Mrs. Thatcher, attending a European Community summit conference in Hanover, West Germany, said: &quot;Downward pressure on inflation will remain and will be honored.&quot;    Many financial-market participants in London had been expecting base rates to be increased a full point. Instead, the central bank triggered only a half-point increase, to 9.5%. Economists believe the government wants to drive rates still higher but is adopting a gradual approach to avoid triggering a surge in sterling that would hurt British exporters.    Economists said base rates are likely to rise to 10% in the near future, and some expect these rates to climb to 11% in the next few months. Ian Amstad, an economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said: &quot;Base rates need to be at least 10% to slow down the economy sufficiently.&quot; He predicted that base rates will peak at 11% in the third quarter.    Yesterday's half-point increase in base rates to 9.5% isn't likely to be enough to cool inflationary pressures because it didn't trigger a rise in mortgage rates, said Gwyn Hacche, an economist at James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;Mortgage rates are one of the main mechanisms by which a change in interest rates affects the demand for consumer credit,&quot; he said.    Building societies, the British equivalent of U.S. savings and loan associations, do most of Britain's mortgage lending, and the three largest societies said yesterday that they weren't likely to increase mortgage lending rates in response to the latest climb in base rates. </TEXT></DOC>
