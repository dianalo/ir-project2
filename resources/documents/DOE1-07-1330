The total count of myelokaryocytes, myelogram,a relative and absolute content of lymphoid cells, immature granulocytesand elements of the erythroid series were defined in the punctates ofthe upper portion of the ilium. T- and B-lymphocyte count, the numberof granulocytomacrophage (CFU-C) and stromal (CFU-F) precursor cellswere defined using morphocytochemical and immunological methods. At thattime an increase in the relative and absolute content of C- ad B-lymphocyteswas noted. The T-cell count and the total number of myelokaryocytes,on the one hand, and the content of immature granulocytes and erythronormoblasts,on the other had, showed correlation of various degree which was particularlynoticeable in the group of unoperated patients. The total number of myelokaryocytesin 1 {mu}l of the bone marrow of the patients after splenectomy, on anaverage, significantly exceeded that in the group of patients with theirradiated spleen. These changes were considered to be a result of therearragement of T-differentiating lymphocytes with their raised accumulationin the bone marrow after irradiation of a considerable volume of thelymphoid tissue and spleen or after splenectomy.</TEXT></DOC>
