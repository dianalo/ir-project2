The proposal drew mixed responses from the major exchanges.    The SEC voted to hold hearings on a staff proposal that would lift the longstanding ban on multiple trading of exchange-listed stocks. The proposal would abolish the lottery system options markets currently use to allocate new stock options contracts among themselves in favor of head-to-head competition.    The commission also decided to ask the five options exchanges to postpone the lottery scheduled for Monday, pending the outcome of rule-making proceedings. The exchanges are poised to take turns picking as many as 10 new stock options contracts each, according to SEC officials.    Richard Ketchum, director of market regulation, acknowledged that the exchanges would be &quot;within their rights&quot; if they went ahead with the lottery, but he expressed hope that they would cooperate. The hearing will be held Sept. 29, he said.    Kenneth Leibler, president of the American Stock Exchange, said the Amex hasn't been a proponent of removing all restrictions to stock options listings, but said the exchange will &quot;consider it.&quot;    The Amex will adhere to the SEC's request to postpone next week's lottery, he said. Noting that the exchange had recently asked the SEC to defer the lottery system, Mr. Leibler added, &quot;We feel the lottery ought to be abolished.&quot;    A spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange said the Big Board has always been in favor of multiple listings. But she said no decision had been made on the commission's request to defer the lottery, adding: &quot;We'll review the SEC's request and discuss it with our board.&quot;    During the late 1970s, the SEC imposed a moratorium on the expansion of the options markets because of growing concern about trading abuses. But since 1980 the agency has allowed multiple trading of several new products, including stock-index options and options on over-the-counter stocks.    In view of these developments, Commissioner Charles Cox said that &quot;it's high time&quot; for the commission to take up the long-deferred question of multiple trading of options on exchange-listed stocks.    Mr. Ketchum told the commissioners that the staff is no longer worried about order-execution and price-quotation problems, which led to the deferral. He also cited studies by SEC economists showing that spreads between bid and ask prices are substantially smaller for multiply traded contracts. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the price investors are willing to pay for options and the price they can get for them.    One study, conducted by the chief economist's office, estimated that stock-options investors would save at least $150 million a year under a multiple-trading system.    But not everyone thinks multiple listing of options is a good idea.    &quot;I think history is the best teacher, and when we had dual listing before, it turned into a disaster,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, head of the options department at L.F. Rothschild Inc. in New York.    Mr. Schwartz noted that in that experiment in the late 1970s, the Amex challenged the Chicago Board Options Exchange -- and won. Most of the orders on stock options in the experiment went to the Amex.    Mr. Schwartz and some other market professionals contended that even with multiple markets, most of the business in each stock option would ultimately go to one exchange. They said that brokerage firms look for the market with the most liquidity and the best trade executions and that the volume leader tends to have both.    The CBOE, which currently trades options on some 165 stocks, wasn't excited with the prospect of multiple listing.    &quot;We have been historically opposed to it because of the way it fragments order flow, which we think is not beneficial to the public,&quot; said Robert A. Bassi, the CBOE's vice president of communications. &quot;But until we see the (SEC's) release, we would prefer not to comment further.&quot;    Mr. Bassi said the question of whether to postpone Monday's lottery is up to the Big Board. The Big Board &quot;requested the lottery, and only they can unrequest it,&quot; he said.    Some industry officials believe the Big Board and Amex could be winners if multiple markets for stock options are established. They said New York's big brokerage firms like to keep business close to home.    A Pacific Stock Exchange spokesman said the exchange wouldn't comment until its executive committee reviews the matter. Officials at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
