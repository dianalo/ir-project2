The Department of the Army intends to prepare an Environmental ImpactStatement (EIS) for the operation of the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) simulatorswhich support the U.S. Army's Nuclear Weapons Survivability TechnologyBase Program. An Environmental Assessment of the Woodbridge Research FacilityOperations at Woodbridge, Virginia, is being completed and will be publishedfor public comment.The U.S. Army Laboratory Command, Harry Diamond Laboratories, as the Army'slead laboratory for Nuclear Weapon Effects Survivability is responsiblefor executing a research and development technology base program that providestechniques to assure that U.S. Army systems will survive the effects ofthe EMP phenomena generated by nuclear weapons on the battlefield. TheHarry Diamond Laboratories EMP program involves research and technologydevelopment for simulating the EMP environment, providing test and evaluationinstrumentation and methods for survivability verification testing, andprotecting U.S. Army systems against the effects of the EMP. For theseefforts, the Army has built and operates EMP simulators at the Harry DiamondLaboratories HDL-WRF, Woodbridge, VA. EMP simulators consist of an electricalcurrent source which generates a very short (one-millionth of a second)pulse of electrical current. The current pulse flows along the simulator'santenna and produces an electromagnetic wave which travels away from theantenna.Alternatives to EMP simulator operations at HDL-WRF which will be consideredin the EIS include:a. Relocate EMP Simulatorsb. Cease all WRF EMP Simulator Operations(1) Use Other Army EMP Simulators(2) Use Navy or Air Force EMP Simulators(3) Use Analysis and Computer Modeling Exclusively(4) Use Laboratory Testing (Scale Model and Direct Injection)c. Build a New EMP Simulator Facility at Another LocationFor this EIS it is anticipated that the Army will use the services of contractors,consultants, and advisors with demonstrated expertise and experience, aswell as scientists, engineers, and other government personnel to accumulatethe necessary information to make the appropriate analyses.2. The environmental impact analysis process will be in accord with theNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, Army Regulation 200-2(32 CFR Part 651), and the regulations of the Council on EnvironmentalQuality, 40 CFR Part 1500. The purpose of this analyses is to determinethe extent of environmental impacts and incorporate appropriate mitigationmeasures.3. The Army will conduct a scoping process to aid in determining the significantissues related to the proposed action. Public as well as federal, state,and local agency participation and input are desired. To provide an opportunityfor public input to the scoping process, interested individuals, governmentalagencies, and private organizations are invited to submit information andcomments for consideration and possible incorporation into the Army's EIS.Particularly solicited is information that would assist the Army in analyzingthe potential environmental consequences of the proposed action. This includesinformation on other environmental studies, issues and alternatives whichthe EIS should consider, major impacts, and recommended mitigating measuresassociated with the proposed action.4. A public scoping meeting will be held in January 1989. The time andplace will be announced in a later issue of the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>This meeting is intended to provide a forumfor individuals or agencies to offer information relevant to the environmentalimpacts or aspects of the proposed action which should be considered bythe Army. Those unable to attend the scoping meeting may convey their concernsby writing to the address shown below. Notice will also be mailed to groupsand individuals, agencies, and anyone responding to this Notice of Intentdesiring to be informed on the details of this upcoming public participationmeeting. Questions and comments regarding the scope of the environmentalanalysis should be submitted to:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Army Laboratory Command, ATTN: AMSLC-PA, 2800 Powder Mill Road,Adelphi, MD 20783-1145.</ITAG>Comments and suggestions should be received no later than 15 days followingthe public scoping meeting to be considered in the Draft EIS (DEIS). Foradditional information call (301) 394-3590.5. The DEIS is expected to be available to the public in September 1989.The completed DEIS will be available for review in order that interestedpersons may comment on the document. Comments received will be consideredin preparation of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Personsdesiring to be placed on a mailing list to receive additional informationregarding the public scoping process and copies of the DEIS and FEIS maycontact Ms. Marian Singleton at the address above.<ITAG tagnum="34">January 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lewis D.
