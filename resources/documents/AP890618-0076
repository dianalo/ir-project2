Eight motorized rubber dinghies and a small sailing boatbelonging to the international environmental organization Greenpeacefailed to keep the battleship from dropping anchor in Kiel harbor,Greenpeace said in a statement from Hamburg.   A scuffle ensued when West German marine police showed up with 15ships and rubber boats, it said.   West German television showed two motorized Greenpeace dinghiesjust under the Iowa's giant anchor, which was hovering in the air.It also showed police boats pushing the dinghies away.   A banner from the boat read: ``No Nukes in Kiel. Greenpeace.''   Police ``pushed off and hauled away'' some of the activists'rubber boats, ending the protest, Greenpeace said.   The activists said the Iowa may be carrying nuclear weapons. U.S.officials refuse to say whether ships are armed with nuclear weapons.   The 58,000-ton Iowa, one of the world's biggest warships, laterdropped anchor in this northern city.   It sailed into Kiel to take part in the annual ``Kiel Week''nautical show that opened Saturday.
