Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration andNaturalization Service.   Apprehensions totaled more than 940,000 in the fiscal yearending Oct. 1, while there were 1.12 million apprehensions infiscal 1987 and a record 1.62 million in 1986.   At a news conference, Nelson acknowledged that temporaryreassignment of some border control agents during the fiscal yearmay account for some of the decline. He said other factors are thedecreased number of illegal aliens in the United States because ofmass legalizations under the 1986 immigration act and the fact thatdrought conditions contributed to less demand for farm laborers.   The number of non-Mexican immigrants apprehended increased lastfiscal year to 39,000 from 37,000 in 1987, other officials said,with about a fourth of those each year from El Salvador and therest from more than 100 other countries.   Nelson said the fact that the trend has not been the same fornon-Mexicans is probably ``a function of distance.'' He said peoplewho have to travel greater distances from other countries to theborder are more likely not to be deterred by aggressive enforcementor changes in immigration laws.   Nelson said the INS increased its Border Patrol forces to recordnumbers during the year, with plans to have 1,400 new agents onduty by next June, bringing the total along the southern border to4,300. Investigation staff has increased 75 percent since lastfiscal year, he said.   This has resulted in apprehension of 50,000 criminal aliens, upfrom 33,500 a year earlier, Nelson said.   ``These figures show we are making more effective use of ourenforcement resources by concentrating them on the most seriousproblems of illegal immigration _ that is, we go after the alienswho are causing the most harm to society,'' he said.   Border Patrol seizures of narcotics along the southern borderincreased from 2,751 cases to more than 3,000 last year, increasingin value by $100 million to $681.1 million for the fiscal year,Nelson said.   He said the INS has received 2.65 million applications fortemporary resident status under the immigration law, includingnearly twice as many as expected under the less restrictive programfor special agricultural workers _ more than 890,000.   Nelson said 97.5 percent of regular applications and 92 percentof those under the agricultural program are approved. Farm-workerapplicants have to show only that they worked on a U.S. farm for 90days during the previous year to get legal status.   Officials say there are some cases of obvious fraud in theprogram, including applicants who obviously are too well manicuredto be farm workers and some who claim such things as having pickedstrawberries from trees.   Of pending cases, 168,000 are suspected to be fraudulentapplicants, including 136,000 for the agricultural program, saidNelson. He said fewer than 51,000 applications have been deniedunder the immigration act, with 2,844 involving fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
