U.S. District Judge Harold Greene ordered permanent dismissal ofthe charges Tuesday, also outlining the procedure prosecutors coulduse to narrow a broad conspiracy charge against Poindexter.   If prosecutors file a motion, Greene said he ``will strike fromthe indictment'' portions of the charges they want to eliminate.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh wants to reduce the scope ofthe case against Poindexter, who faces trial later this year, toavoid problems involving classified information. Such problemsplagued the Iran-Contra case against Oliver North.   In the North case, prosecutors ultimately had to abandon theentire conspiracy charge against the former White House aide toprotect national secrets and save the remainder of the criminalcase.   Prosecutors in the Poindexter case want to cut the portions ofthe indictment dealing with the diversion to the Contras ofproceeds from arms sales to Iran.   The remainder of the conspiracy charge accuses Poindexter ofobstructing inquiries by Congress and making false and misleadingstatements to government agencies. His alleged conspirators wereNorth, retired Air Force Major Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-bornbusinessman Albert Hakim.   Poindexter also is accused of obstructing a congressionalinquiry into secret Contra resupply operations and obstructingCongress in connection with a false chronology about a shipment ofHawk missiles to Iran. In addition, he faces two charges of makingfalse statements to Congress about the shipment of Hawk missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
