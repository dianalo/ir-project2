Rabin and other officials refrained from direct comment Fridayafter U.S. and PLO delegates held their first face-to-face meetingin Tunisia, but they reiterated their opposition to Washington'sdecision to speak to the organization.   Rabin said the U.S. decision was ``a grave mistake.''   ``You abandoned an important principle in the general Americanpolicy, the principle of opposing terrorism and waging war againstit,'' he said on Israel Television.   Rabin spoke after the 90-minute meeting between U.S. AmbassadorRobert H. Pelletreau and a four-man PLO delegation in Carthage, asuburb of the capital city Tunis.   The defense minister said Israel should demand the United Statesmake Arafat prove he was sincere when he said last week that herenounced all forms of terrorism.   ``Our first demand from the United States should be, put Arafatto a test, demand from him to come out and tell all the Palestiniansin his voice, in Arabic, to stop terror,'' Rabin said.   Despite his opposition to the American-PLO dialogue, Rabin saidit could lead to a decrease in violence.   ``It was clear to us that a large part of the (Palestinian)population will see the events of the week as their achievement, andwill try to moderate their role in violence,'' he said.   ``But it was also clear that radical elements who oppose thesemoves ... will try to heat up the area,'' Rabin told IsraelTelevision.   Rabin, the No. 2 man in the left-leaning Labor Party headed byForeign Minister Shimon Peres, echoed his party leader in sayingIsrael should counter the U.S. initiative with its own peace plan,``even if it would not be accepted in the foreseeable future.''   He spoke on one of the bloodiest days of the Palestinianrebellion against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   In Friday's clashes, Israeli soldiers shot to death four Arabs,and Arab doctors said as many as 32 were wounded.It was among theworst violence since April 16, when Israeli troops killed 14Palestinians during riots protesting the assassination in Tunisia ofKhalil Wazir, the PLO military commander.   The latest deaths brought to 328 the number of Palestinianskilled in the yearlong revolt. Thirteen Israelis have also diedduring the unrest.   Meanwhile, aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said therightist Likud bloc leader recognized the need for a credibleIsraeli peace plan.   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said the prime minister wasconsidering ``new moves.''   ``Be sure that Mr. Shamir is preparing a peace move which willsurprise everyone,'' Pazner said, refusing to disclose details.   Newspaper reports said the plan was to unilaterally establish alimited self-rule for Palestinians, as envisioned in the Camp Davidaccords mediated by the United States in 1978.   Friday's confrontations in the occupied lands were inspired bythe death Thursday night of a teen-ager from a gunshot woundsuffered Nov. 25, according to doctors at Anglican Hospital inNablus.   Army officials said the riots appeared premeditated and began innumerous areas even before the teen-ager's funeral in the West Bankcity of Nablus.   West Bank commander Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir said the high casualtytoll ``resulted from the fact that we had to disperse riots in manylocations.''   Doctors said 20 people were wounded in Nablus, four of themcritically. The army confirmed four killed and nine wounded.   Soldiers wounded five Palestinians in villages near Tulkarem inthe West Bank, including a 9-year-old boy shot in the neck, Arabwitnesses said.   Doctors said seven young men were wounded at the Rafah, Nuseiratand Jabaliya refugee camps in the Gaza Strip.</TEXT></DOC>
