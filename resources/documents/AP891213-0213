(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tennessee's secretary of state,reportedly under investigation by federal authorities when he put agun in his mouth and fired, suffered swelling in his brainWednesday, a hospital spokesman said.   Doctors said that was to be expected, and treated the conditionwith drugs, and Gentry Crowell, 57, remained in critical but stablecondition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said spokesmanWayne Wood.   Crowell was found Tuesday morning by one of his sons on theporch of his home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. The.38-caliber pistol was next to him.   He was taken to the hospital in Nashville, where he underwent afour-hour operation.   The Nashville Banner reported Tuesday that federal authoritiesinvestigating illegal bingo gambling and public corruption had beenclosing in on Crowell.   The Banner quoted unidentified sources as saying thatinvestigators were focusing on how Crowell solicited politicalcampaign money from architects, engineers and bingo operators.   The investigation has lasted four years. Since January, theprobe has resulted in 22 people being indicted or pleading guilty.   Crowell's former chief bingo inspector, W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker,is serving a seven-year federal prison sentence on a convictionthat includes extorting payoffs from bingo operators.   His former assistant, Mary Sue Wright, was named an unindictedco-conspirator in an illegally operated Memphis bingo hall andgiven immunity from prosecution. She resigned in August beforegiving testimony before the U.S. grand jury in Memphis.   Bingo, previously legal for charity, was outlawed this year whenthe Tennessee Supreme Court ruled it a lottery, violating the stateconstitution.   Republican state Sen. Ronnie Greer and Bob Lynch, a formerassistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted former Gov. Ray Blanton onliquor license conspiracy charges, said Wednesday that theinvestigation had paralyzed state government.   ``I think it would be in everyone's interest if this case wereconcluded,'' said Greer.   Less than five months ago, state Rep. Ted Ray Miller ofKnoxville killed himself following published reports that he hadtaken bribes in connection with a Knox County waste disposalproject.   Neither Crowell nor Miller had been indicted. Crowell testifiedbefore federal grand juries in Nashville and Memphis about bingoregulation.   ``The simple fact that this kind of investigation draws so muchattention, they (prosecutors) run the risk of destroying somepeople's lives,'' Lynch said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Washko, lead prosecutor in thebingo-corruption case in Nashville, was unavailable for comment,his office said.   Lynch is defending state Rep. Tommy Burnett, a Democrat, onmultiple charges growing out of an illegal bingo operation.</TEXT></DOC>
