SpiegelmanandM;Hungry for higher profits and a diversified customer base, PC makers areeyeing the workstation market, vendors and industry analysts say.andM;Last week, Everex Systems Inc. announced it will enter the workstation marketin the second quarter of this year with a combination 80386 and ReducedInstruction Set Computing (RISC)-based computer, company officials said.andO;Details of the new computer and Everex's agreement with Unix specialist OpusSystems Inc. were not available.andP;  Everex sources said the computer is an80386-based system with an add-in board based on Motorola Inc.'s 88K-byteRISC chip.andM;This combination of RISC and 80386 chips means the computer is compatiblewith DOS, OS/2 and Unix applications, sources said.andM;But Everex isn't the only vendor looking for greener pastures in theworkstation market.andP;  Industry sources say other PC makers exploring this areainclude Tandy Corp., Advanced Logic Research Inc. and Dell Computer Corp.andM;Market researchers have said the worldwide workstation market is worth atleast $2.5 billion and will grow 30 percent to 40 percent a year through1992.andM;Although a fast, 25MHz 80386 computer is very competitive with a workstationcomputer, PCs can't compete with high-end graphics, software and networkingsolutions offered by the workstation vendors, said Neil Mehta, president ofClub American Technologies Inc., a PC maker in Fremont, Calif.andM;Neverthless, Mehta said, the workstation market is worth eyeing.andM;To some extent, makers of '386 computers are already competing in theworkstation market with Sun Microsystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. andApollo Computer Inc.andM;PC maker Compaq Computer Corp. recently took steps to satisfy the workstationmarket by announcing a 1,024-by-768 pixel graphics board and monitor.andO;According to Gary Stimac, vice president of engineering for the Houston-basedcompany, Compaq will continue to address the high-end computer-aided designand Unix markets with upgrades.andM;Despite the expertise PC makers have in developing high-performance, low-costsystems, there are challenges ahead for them in this market, said Raj Jaswa,manager of systems logic for Chips andamp; Technologies Inc., a chip maker in SanJose, Calif.andP;  ''PC makers have traditionally offered high volumes at goodprices.andP;  But the workstation market is dominated by companies offering acomplete solution,'' he said.andM;But for PC makers, success in the workstation market is only a matter oftime, said John Dean, an industry analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc., aSan Francisco investment firm.andP;  ''The first logical step for PC makers is thecombination RISC system and Intel chip system,'' Dean said.andP;  ''The secondstep is to have two product lines.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
