The new system is actually NASD-developed software that operates on the personal computers of traders in firms that make markets in OTC securities. Terminals using the new software have been operating in a pilot program at some regional and national firms, including Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The software is now being made available to other firms that elect to install it, a NASD spokesman said.    It will take several months for the new software to alter significantly OTC trading, however, because proposed rule changes also are involved.    For several days during and following the crash, large segments of the OTC market ground to a standstill. One reason was that over-the-counter traders weren't able to reach other market makers by telephone to sell OTC shares. As a result, many customer sell orders couldn't be executed during the price collapse.    &quot;The telephone was the biggest bottleneck,&quot; Joseph Hardiman, president of the NASD, said yesterday.    In addition, some market makers deliberately &quot;locked and crossed&quot; stocks they didn't want to buy from investors who wanted to unload. These market makers raised the &quot;bid&quot; price they would pay for certain issues over the &quot;ask&quot; price at which they would sell them. This caused the NASD's computerized small-order execution system, which permits automatic computer trading of small blocks of stock, to malfunction.    &quot;Locked and crossed markets prohibited (the small order system) from working effectively. That sent brokers to the phones, exacerbating the problem,&quot; Mr. Hardiman said, in his assessment of the October chaos that confronted the OTC market.    Until now, Nasdaq, or the NASD's automated quotation system, has provided computer terminals with price quotations on all issues. Most big trades, however, are negotiated by telephone and then recorded in the system's computers. Only the small-order system has provided traders with the ability to execute trades by computer rather than by telephone.    The new Nasdaq system, combined with the small order system, extends capacity for computer-to-computer trade execution to all sizes of orders on the 5,800 Nasdaq securities, according to the NASD.    It also will create records of attempts to place orders by any broker who is unable to reach a market maker by telephone. &quot;It will create an order trail&quot; that can be followed in any subsequent investigations, Mr. Hardiman explained.    With the new system, and with implementation of previously announced Nasdaq rule changes, locked and crossed bids can't freeze the NASD's computer system. The rule changes also will make the small-order system a mandatory method of executing orders by all market makers.    &quot;This change will give investors continuous access to (the small order system) throughout periods of high volume and volatile prices,&quot; Mr. Hardiman said. &quot;It will also provide an economic incentive for market makers to keep their price quotations constant,&quot; he added.    Currently, about 13% of all Nasdaq trading is done through the small-order system, but with the rule changes is expected to expand to 25%-30%, a NASD spokesman said.    The new software advances the NASD toward its long-held goal of developing a world-wide computerized trading network. However, some traders assert that the proposed new rules accompanying the technical innovation might cause some of the 545 market makers to pull out. That could at least partly negate some of the new efficiencies.    Some market makers feel threatened by the new rules, currently being prepared by the NASD for submission to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Hardiman said yesterday that the rule changes should be in effect by June 30.    The 42 letters received by the NASD on its rules proposal &quot;were balanced between support and opposition,&quot; Mr. Hardiman said yesterday. &quot;Smaller firms felt mandatory participation (in the computerized trading system) might significantly reduce their participation&quot; in the market, he explained.    He said that the NASD understands the problems of the smaller brokers. &quot;We will find a way to make sure they continue to play a role,&quot; he said.    What's bothering the little firms, according to Walter Carucci, vice president of Carr Securities Corp., a New York-based market maker, is that during &quot;moments of extreme market activity, a collapse as before, or news on a stock,&quot; orders can suddenly deluge a market maker before he has adequate information on which to base his bid. Under current rules, he said, if buy orders suddenly accelerate, a market makers can honor a token bid, while getting on the telephone to find out what was happening.    Without that capability of calling a time-out, and being required to execute all small-order trades, small market makers deluged by sudden orders could be thrown into financial jeopardy. </TEXT></DOC>
