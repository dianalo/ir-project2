The Oct. 11 flight into northern Israel caused a public uproarin Israel over possible flaws in the air defense system along theborder with Syria.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Monday a militaryinvestigation team concluded a ``faulty report and mistakendecision-making process'' in Israel's air force led to a failure inintercepting the flight. It recommended an officer be reprimanded,and military officials said the air force was expected to updateits standing orders and procedures related to air infiltrations.   Ad-Diyar, a conservative daily based in Christian east Beirut,said in an unsourced front-page reportthat a Druse woman, who wasnot identified, confessed she had been recruited by Israeliintelligence following her arrest after her boyfriend defected.   Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel, 34, was on a training flight oversouthern Syria when he flew into Israel and landed at an airstripused by crop-dusting planes.   Ad-Diyar said Israel was interested in gaining directinformation from a Syrian pilot on the MiG-23. Syria is Israel'sarchfoe in the Middle East.   ``After some surveillance, an Israeli secret service officerfound out that a Syrian Druse girl was having an affair with aSyrian pilot,'' the paper said.   It said the woman from Soweida, the provincial capital ofsouthern Syria, frequently visited Druse relatives in Hasbaya, justoutside an Israeli-controlled security zone in south Lebanon.   The officer approached the woman and recruited her to work forMossad, giving her enough money to lure Adel to defect to Israel,Ad-Diyar said.   ``The girl told her boyfriend that Israel would provide themwith a house and a large amount of money, estimated at millions ofdollars, or new documents with which the couple could travel to theUnited States,'' it added.   It said Mossad provided Adel with a special radio frequency forcontacting Israeli authorities once in the air so he could be givena flight plan.   After the warning Adel would revert to the normal Syrian airforce frequency and continue his routine training flight for about20 minutes to give Israel time to prepare for his arrival.   The newspaper said Adel was ordered on a training flight the dayafter receiving the Israeli instructions and had no time to warnhis girlfriend.   Ad-Diyar said the girl was at home unaware of the actualdefection, preparing to leave for Israel two days later viaHasbaya, to join Adel.   It said Syrian secret police arrested a number of peopleconnected to Adel, including his girlfriend, after the defection.   ``She revealed everything during interrogation,'' Ad-Diyar said.   Adel asked for political asylum in Israel. He said he defectedin search of freedom and democracy.   Israeli reports said Adel flew for seven minutes over Israeliterritory before radar detected his plane, leading to an uproarover what appeared to be an air defense failure.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed for calm and Chief ofStaff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron ordered an investigation.   A military command statement said Monday that investigatorsrecommended the colonel in charge of Israel's air defenses at thetime be reprimanded for his actions following a mistaken decision.   They recommended that the air traffic controller in charge atthe time, a lieutenant colonel, be ``notified of the faulty reportthat contributed to a mistaken decision.''   ``A number of technical malfunctions have been identified andwill be dealt with by the air force,'' the statement said. Shomrontold Israel TV these were ``secondary malfunctions.''   The army said Shomron accepted the team's recommendations.   One question not answered was why Adel spent 20 minutes on theground with no security officials around after landing at Megiddo,a few minutes' flight from Haifa, a port city of 250,000.</TEXT></DOC>
