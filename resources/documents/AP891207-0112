He also suggested that some career military men and employees ofthe national arms manufacturing company may lose their jobs.   The announcement came two weeks after South Africa completed thewithdrawal of its troops from Namibia, where they had fought a bushwar against pro-independence guerrillas since 1966. A year ago,South Africa signed a treaty that cleared the way for Namibia'sindependence and also halted South African involvement in the civilwar in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.   De Klerk's announcement marked the second time in 10 days he hastaken action counter to standing policies of the securityestablishment that held strong influence under his predecessor,P.W. Botha. On Nov. 28, de Klerk scrapped a nationwide securitynetwork that was denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.   When the Namibian and South African-Angolan wars ended, DefenseForce chiefs and the Defense Minsiter Magnus Malan had said therewould be no cutbacks or service reductions because the governmentstill had to defend its borders against guerrilla infiltration fromsurrounding countries.   Last week, Malan reversed himself, saying it was no longernecessary for South African forces to stage cross-border raids orsupport anti-government groups in neighboring countries. Themilitary units de Klerk has suggested eliminating may be thoseinvolved in such clandestine actions. He said details would begiven next year.   Zach de Beer, a leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,said de Klerk's action was ``an indication that the relationshipbetween ourselves and our neighbors in southern Africa haveimproved and we look forward to a more peaceful time.''   ``The Conservative Party is ... concerned that the statepresident's unilateral and over-hasty decision will be detrimentalto state security,'' said Koos van der Merwe, defense spokesman forthe largest white opposition party. He warned against creation of a``peace pscyhosis,'' when, he said, the outlawed African NationalCongress was continuing its guerrilla actions.   Van der Merwe suggested that rather than reducing the strengthof the Defense Force, the extra soldiers be assigned to theundermanned police force, and that black, Indian and mixed-race menalso be subject to conscription. Now, only white men can beconscripted. Military service for other races is voluntary.   De Beer, as well as several business organizations, said thereduction in military service would help the economy by slowing the``brain drain'' of young men who leave the country rather thanserve, diminish disruption of careers and allow more educated mento enter the workforce earlier.   De Klerk, opening a new headquarters for the state armsmanufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in themilitary would have their terms of service shortened, new drafteeswould serve one year instead of two, and the number of recalls totemporary service would be reduced.   The End Conscription Campaign, a restricted organization thatwants young men to be given a choice between military and communityservice, said, ``This reduction does not remove the huge dilemmafacing conscripts who still have to choose whether to serve in anapartheid army.''   In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform militaryservice, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws.   Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1{times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men are servingsix-year terms.   The government does not release information on the manpower ofthe armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, therehave been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million whitemales of all ages in South Africa.   The president said efforts would be made to find new jobs forcareer military personnel and employees of Armscor, thegovernment-owned weapons company, who might lose their jobs as partof the cutback.</TEXT></DOC>
