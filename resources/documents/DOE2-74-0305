They suggest that at similar depths,the values obtained for Cacheuta Fm are considerably lower than thoseobtained in Potrerillos and Las Cabras Fms. In order to explain thissituation, Hutton and Cook (1980) concepts were taken, which relate reflectancevalues to the alginite volume of samples. 3 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
