Many experts blame these accidents onoperations at or above practical capacity. Some unions,consultants and industry executives say companies don't wantto stop production and do needed maintenance, and this, theysay, has compromised safety.   The department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration said it has uncovered internal Phillipsdocuments &quot;that called for corrective action but which werelargely ignored.&quot; And in a report on chemical-industry safetyproblems that will go to the White House soon, a studycommissioned by the Labor Department will note otherinstances of chemical companies that &quot;refused to beresponsive to&quot; internal audit reports that warned of safetyhazards, said Alan McMillan, an OSHA official. Thoseinstances won't show the same &quot;scope&quot; as the Phillipsdocuments, however, he said.   Work on that report has been pushed along by the Phillipscatastrophe.   The explosions and an accompanying fire killed 23 workersand injured more than 130 at Phillips's Pasadena, Texas,petrochemical plant. The $5.7 million fine is thesecond-largest the agency has ever proposed against a singlecompany.   OSHA also proposed penalties of $730,000 against FishEngineering andamp; Construction Inc., a Houston-area contractor onthe chemical plant's site. Fish said it would contest thecitations.   OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful violations, involvingfailure to protect 566 workers from fire and explosiondangers, and of other &quot;serious violations.&quot; The citationsincluded failure to prevent the uncontrolled release offlammable vapors, use of inappropriate valves and inadequatefire protection. Fish was cited for 181 willful violations,including failure to protect its workers from fire andexplosion.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said there was &quot;clearevidence that this explosion was avoidable had recognizedsafety procedures been followed.&quot; OSHA officials wouldn'tdiscuss the Phillips documents.   The fire and explosions, one of America's biggest postwarindustrial accidents, shook downtown Houston a dozen milesaway and resulted in the most fatalities of any accident atan oil refinery or petrochemical plant in recent years.   Some industry officials said a vastly reduced work forceand the oil industry's increasing dependence on outsidecontractors have contributed to heightened danger at plants.   Fish has been the almost-exclusive maintenance contractorat the Pasadena site for about 17 years and has performed asimilar role at other Phillips plants, OSHA said. Four of theworkers killed and 52 of those injured worked for Fish.   &quot;Phillips is not a renegade,&quot; said Richard Leonard,director of special projects for the Oil, Chemical and AtomicWorkers Union. &quot;There is very little difference between themand other companies around the country,&quot; he said.   Glen Williamson, an OSHA deputy regional director, saidyesterday's action &quot;sends a very clear signal that the agencyis going to take a very strong enforcement position.&quot; OSHAhas come under fire from safety experts for what theyconsider innocuous fines, sometimes only hundreds of dollars,for violations at many plants, but it has been taking astronger tack since Gerard Scannell took over as head of theagency last year.   Even so, Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of theHouse Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment andHousing, said the Phillips explosion showed &quot;the cop was noton the beat.&quot; He noted that two months before the Octoberexplosions, an accident at the same plant killed one workerand seriously injured two others, but OSHA didn't do acomplete inspection. The last full sweep was in 1974.   After hearing news reports of the August incident, OSHAinvestigators did show up, ultimately determining that duringroutine maintenance, gases escaped to an area where weldingtorches touched off a flash fire and explosion. OSHA finedPhillips $720.   OSHA said its inspections of Phillips plants in afour-state region showed 18 deaths and many hospitalizationsprior to October.   Mr. Scannell said the primary cause of the fire andexplosions in October was the release, during maintenancework, of four highly flammable process gases from an openvalve between a reactor vessel and a chemical-settling leg.Most of the gas escaped quickly because of high pressure, anda huge vapor cloud sped through the plant and exploded whenit came in contact with an ignition source, OSHA said. Otherexplosions followed.   Contrary to Phillips procedures and industry practice,there was no backup protection against valve failure oruntimely valve opening, OSHA said.   Phillips's own investigation asserted that the valveshould have been closed but wasn't because of &quot;human error,&quot;a spokesman said.   The Phillips explosions seemed to frighten the oilindustry into tightening up its maintenance procedures.Unlike the situation in 1988 and 1989, when many companiespostponed maintenance and ran their plants full out, thisyear they have closed down equipment to perform necessaryhousekeeping. Plants are running around 80% to 85% ofcapacity, and the number of fires and explosions appears tohave been reduced markedly. But in December, part of a hugeExxon Corp. refinery in Baton Rouge, La., exploded, killingtwo workers.   Phillips and Fish have 15 days to contest the citationsbefore the independent Occupational Safety and Health ReviewCommission.</TEXT></DOC>
