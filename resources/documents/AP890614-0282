DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Wall Street financier John A. MulherenJr., already accused of plotting to kill Ivan F. Boesky, was chargedWednesday with engaging in a series of illegal securities fraudschemes with the jailed stock speculator.   A 42-count federal indictment charged Mulheren with manipulatingthe price of Gulf andamp; Western Inc. common stock to assist Boesky,whose 1986 guilty plea triggered a series of Wall Street fraudinvestigations.   Mulheren also was accused of plotting a series of sham stocktransactions to help Boesky companies evade taxes and circumventsecurities laws in what prosecutors called ``a classic case ofparking'' securities.   Specifically, Mulheren, 39, of Rumson, N.J., was charged withconspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and keeping fraudulentrecords. He faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fineon each of the 42 counts.   Last month, Mulheren pleaded innocent in New Jersey to stateweapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot onBoesky's life. Mulheren was arrested in February 1988 near his homewith a loaded semi-automatic rifle local authorities alleged heplanned to use against Boesky.   He remains free on $20 million bond for a previous federal chargeof threatening a witness stemming from the New Jersey case. Federalofficials have never identified the alleged target, but New Jerseypolice have said it was Boesky.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the federal charge ofthreatening a witness would be dropped Friday in favor of the stateweapons possession charges.   ``We are content, for now, to pursue the securities charges andhave the Monmouth County prosecutors office pursue the state chargesarising from possession of a weapon,'' Romano told a news conference.   Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, said his client ``intends toplead not guilty and go to trial. This position has been stated on anumber of cases.''   Puccio added: ``In my view, the charges _ like Ivan Boesky'scredibility _ don't get any better with age.''   Mulheren was a general partner and chief trader at JamieSecurities, a now-defunct Manhattan investment and arbitrage firm.   Also indicted Wednesday was Leonard DeStefano, 32, a formertrader at Jamie. He was named on three counts of conspiracy, mailfraud and fraudulent recordkeeping.   Prosecutors said Mulheren aided Boesky because his risk arbitragebusiness ``stood to gain from non-public information'' supplied byBoesky, once one of Wall Street's top speculators in the stock oftakeover targets.   Boesky paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges withthe SEC in 1986 and pleaded guilty to a single felony count. He isin the second year of a three-year jail term at a federal prison inLompoc, Calif. Boesky's confessions led to a series of major WallStreet fraud investigations.   Romano would not divulge what inside information Boesky allegedlygave Mulheren.   The indictment charged that in October 1985, Mulheren helpedBoesky manipulate the price of common stock of Gulf andamp; Western, whichhas since been renamed Paramount Communications Inc.   According to the indictment, on Oct. 16, 1985 ,Gulf andamp; Western _which was in the midst of a 12 million share stock repurchase _agreed to buy a block of stock from Boesky, but only if the marketprice rose to $45 per share. At the time, Gulf andamp; Western's stock wastrading at $44.75.   The next day, the indictment charged, Mulheren at Boesky'sinstigation made several large purchases of Gulf andamp; Western stockwithin a six-minute period, driving up the price to $45 per share.   Seven minutes after the final Mulheren purchase, Gulf andamp; Westernbought 3.4 million shares of its own stock from Boesky and 3.2million from an unidentified investor for $45 per share.   The indictment also charged that Mulheren and DeStefano schemedwith employees of Boesky's now-defunct Seemala Corp. to engage in aseries of sham stock transactions, enabling Seemala to evade taxesand circumvent mimimum capital limits required of broker-dealers bythe Securities and Exchange Commission.   Romano called the schemes to conceal the stock's true ownership``a classic case of parking.''   When stocks are illegally parked to conceal their true ownership,an investor sells them with an understanding the buyer will returnthem, usually at a specified date and price. The ruse is often usedto avoid disclosing a 5 percent stake in a company to concealpossible takeover interest.   ``The ultimate objective may be slightly different, but theconcealment aspects are very typical of a parking scheme,'' Romanosaid.</TEXT></DOC>
