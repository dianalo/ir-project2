In his year on thefederal appeals court in Washington, Judge Thomas wrote 19opinions. His political enemies won't find much grist inthese rulings, which are textbook examples of judicialrestraint.   The cases deal with issues as diverse as an airport forToledo, searches of crack dealers and a spat over dog-foodclaims. What is most important is the approach Judge Thomastook. In interpreting statutes and precedents, he used closereasoning and shunned any search for shadows, penumbra oremanations.</LP><TEXT>   The case challenging the expansion of the Toledo airportasked whether the Federal Aviation Authority complied withall the environmental regulations before approving the newplans. The plaintiffs invoked the broadly worded NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. In upholding most of the FAA'saction, Judge Thomas showed a keen wit. He wrote, &quot;Just asNEPA is not a green Magna Carta, federal judges are not thebarons at Runnymede.&quot; He said that judges enforce the law &quot;byensuring that agencies comply with NEPA's procedures, and notby trying to coax agency decision makers to reach certainresults.&quot; (Citizens Against Burlington v. Busey)   His most important constitutional ruling was on thedoctrine of standing, which is a key limit to judicialactivism. The Constitution requires a case or controversybefore judges can issue an opinion; there must be realparties with real legal issues. Judicial activists often wavenon-cases into court by giving special-interest groups -- andoccasionally even dolphins and trees -- standing to sue.Judge Thomas took the more traditional approach in a partialdissent when a ferry company challenged an exemption from aregulation that the Interstate Commerce Commission granted toone of its competitors.   Judge Thomas wrote in a partial dissent that the ferrycompany had no business in court because it wasn't the&quot;aggrieved&quot; party, as required by the statute regulatinglitigation involving the ICC. The company wanted the judgesto force the ICC to prepare an environmental impact statementbefore granting new routes to its competitor. &quot;I agree thatas a matter of policy, it probably should,&quot; Judge Thomaswrote. &quot;As a matter of law, however, the Commission has nopower to regulate ferries for environmental reasons.&quot;   This meant the ferry company had no standing to sue, sojudges had no right to hear the case. &quot;When federaljurisdiction does not exist, federal judges have no authorityto exercise it, even if everyone -- judges, parties, membersof the public -- wants the dispute resolved,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Afederal court may not decide cases when it cannot decidecases, and must determine whether it can before it may.&quot; Thisis an important statement of separation of powers -- not theview of a justice who would take social questions away fromthe political branches of government. (CrossSound FerryServices v. ICC)   Judge Thomas also showed his judicial restraint in a caseof ineptitude by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Judges have repeatedly ruled that regulators used arbitrarycalculations to determine the proper rate of return for aTennessee gas pipeline. Judge Thomas warned FERC that he wastempted to grant the pipeline company's request for a certainrate. But, he wrote, &quot;legitimate concerns about judicialoverreaching always militate in favor of affording the agencyjust one more chance to explain its decision.&quot; (Tennessee GasPipeline v. FERC)   One case at first glance seems to raise constitutionalquestions, but turns out to be more limited. Federal workersasked for a preliminary injunction against a recent law thatbars them from accepting payment for articles or speeches.This raises free speech and property rights questions, butJudge Thomas's opinion was limited to whether the trial courtwas right to deny a preliminary injunction. He agreed thatthe plaintiffs did not risk irreparable harm by waiting forthe trial court to rule on the case's merits. (NTEU v. U.S.)   A pair of business cases discloses a sophisticatedapproach. He ruled against a Justice Department claim that amerger in the market for underground drilling rigs wouldviolate the antitrust laws. The merger between a Finnishcompany and a French subsidiary of a Texas firm would givethe company a large U.S. market share, but Judge Thomasapplied the Chicago School jurisprudence that now guides theSupreme Court. Contrary to the Justice Department'sbig-is-bad approach, he ruled that a large market share doesnot by itself signal barriers to entry for new competitors.(U.S. v. Baker Hughes)   Another case arose when two pet-food companies exchangednasty accusations of misleading advertising -- one dog foodclaimed it prevented hip disease, the other claimed it waspreferred by more veterinarians. Judge Thomas reversed partof a damage award because there was no &quot;finding ofwillfullness or bad faith,&quot; as required by thefalse-advertising statute. This emphasis on bad intent, oftenoverlooked in securities and environmental cases, is animportant limit on liability. (ALPO v. Ralston Purina)   Seven of Judge Thomas's opinions were appeals from drugcases; as a justice, he will have some notion of what it isthe police are up against. Most of these cases were requestsby defense lawyers for a judge to find some technical problemwith a search, seizure or confession, which Judge Thomasrefused. In one case, the defendants tried to throw a gym bagcontaining crack into a sewer when the police approached.Other seizures included beepers, a favorite tool of the drugtrade. Judge Thomas referred to one neighborhood as &quot;anopen-air drug bazaar.&quot;   His close reading of a statute led him to reverse part ofa criminal conviction of a dealer named Keith Long. Thepolice used a search warrant to find cocaine, butane torchesfor processing the drug and large amounts of cash. They alsodiscovered a revolver between the cushions of a sofa. A juryconvicted the defendant on the drug charges, but also under alaw against using or carrying a weapon in drug trafficking.   Judge Thomas reversed the firearm conviction. He said theprosecution reasoning went too far: &quot;Long was connected tothe drugs; the distribution of the drugs was facilitated bythe gun; since Long thus derived benefit from the gun, he`used' it.&quot; He rejected this view, saying it would mean &quot;thatthe word `use' has no discernible boundaries.&quot;   Judge Thomas is a conservative judge, if this means thathe views his job as interpreting the law and not making it upor ruling for or against parties based on who they are. A30-year period of judicial activism from the Supreme Court isnow destined to end. Even liberals should be able to resolvethemselves to a Justice Thomas, who would know his job is thelaw and not politics.</TEXT></DOC>
