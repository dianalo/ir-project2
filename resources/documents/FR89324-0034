Records of certain domestic coin and currency transactions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>In General.</T3>_If the Secretary of the Treasury finds, upon the Secretary'sown initiative or at the request of an appropriate Federal or State lawenforcement official, that reasonable grounds exist for concluding thatadditional recordkeeping and reporting requirements are necessary to carryout the purposes of this subtitle and prevent evasions thereof, the Secretarymay issue an order requiring any domestic financial institution or groupof domestic financial institutions in a geographic area_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) to obtain such information as the Secretary may describe in suchorder concerning_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) any transaction in which such financial institution is involvedfor the payment, receipt, or transfer of United States coins or currency(or such other monetary instruments as the Secretary may describe in suchorder) the total amounts or denominations of which are equal to or greaterthan an amount which the Secretary may prescribe; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) any other person participating in such transaction;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) to maintain a record of such information for such period of timeas the Secretary may require; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) to file a report with respect to any transaction desribed in paragraph(1)(A) in the manner and to the extent specified in the order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Maximum Effective Period For Order.</T3>_No order issued under subsection(a) shall be effective for more than 60 days unless renewed pursuant tothe requirements of subsection (a).</ITAG>The practical effect of this amendment is to permit the Secretary to lowerthe reporting threshold of andSection; 103.22(a) for a financial institution,or a group of financial institutions, in a specified geographic area ofthe United States. Generally, the Secretary would require a financial institutionor group of financial institutions to lower, for a certain specified periodof time, the $10,000 threshold for some or all of the types of transactionswhich currently must be reported at the $10,000 level.Unless otherwise specified in the order, financial institutions involvedin the targeted transactions would have to provide the same informationrequired under the Bank Secrecy Act regulations for reporting under 31CFR 103.22(a). This reporting requirement would be in addition to the presentrequirement in 31 U.S.C. 5313 and 31 CFR 103.22(a) that requires financialinstitutions to report currency transactions over $10,000. Congress wasconcerned with the prevalence of schemes involving structuring of currencytransactions below $10,000 to avoid the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirementsin certain areas of the country.The House Report on this provision noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee is persuaded that such authority is necessary in orderto target those geographic areas and those specific financial institutionswhich may be more prone to be abused by organized crime, and especiallynarcotics trafficking. It is expected that such targeted recordkeepingand reporting requirements would be of limited duration and would providelaw enforcement authorities with additional tools to combat money launderingoperations associated with organized crime and drug trafficking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">H. Rep. 100-716, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 8.</ITAG>Treasury was asked to comment on this provision while it was still a legislativeproposal and stated that it believed that the information obtained couldbe highly useful to law enforcement officials, because ``[o]n-the-spotanalysis of the information may very well lead to the breakup of moneylaundering organizations.'' Statement of the Honorable Gerald L. Hilsher,Deputy Assistant Secretary (Law Enforcement), before the Committee on Banking,Finance and Urban Affairs, U.S. House of Representative, June 8, 1988.The regulation proposed today sets out procedures and limitations to governthe issuance of a ``geographic targeting order'' under section 5326(a).Under these procedures, prior to selecting an area of the country for targetedreporting, Treasury would make a determination that a high level of drugmoney laundering or other illegal activity may be occurring in that areaat levels below the current $10,000 currency reporting threshold. Generally,a request from a Treasury law enforcement ``currency group'' or joint financialinvestigative task force would trigger such a determination. A requestalso could be made by any Federal or State law enforcement agency. Treasuryanticipates that, at least initially, geographic areas subject to the enhancedreporting requirement would be as small as a few city blocks or as largeas a city or county. Following identification of the geographic area, Treasury would identifythe affected financial institution or institutions (as that term is definedin 31 CFR 103.11(g)), including, for example, banks, check cashers, securitiesdealers or brokers, or casinos, to receive the geographic targeting orderin that area. Each financial institution would receive an order requiringit to keep a record of specified currency transactions at or above a specifiedmonetary limit, for a certain period of time (not to exceed 60 days), andto file a report as prescribed by Treasury on those transactions and theindividuals involved beginning on a date specified in the order. The type and dollar amount of the currency transactions and other informationto be reported also would be specified in the order. All of the informationthat is being requested as well as the instructions on how and where tofile the reports (not necessarily the IRS Detroit Computing Center) willbe specified in the order. Treasury also will specify how long the recordsgenerated in response to this order will have to be kept. Treasury will try to provide each affected financial institution with sufficienttime to implement a geographic targeting order. In determining the amountof time allowed by the order for financial institutions to implement anychanges in their bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements, Treasury willconsider the number and type of financial institution(s) and financialtransaction(s) as well as the amount of specified information requiredto be reported. In addition, Treasury will make every effort to work withthe targeted financial institutions to ensure maximum compliance with thetargeting order at a minimum burden to the financial institutions. Thename of a Treasury contact will be provided to offer assistance if needed.For example, if it is determined that there may be a high degree of moneylaundering in City X by individuals purchasing cashier's checks with currencyin amounts of $5,000 or more, the affected financial institutions in CityX could be required to report all purchases of casher's checks between$5,000 and $10,000.01 in currency for 60 days. Similarly, if it is determinedthat currency transactions in amounts in excess of $6,000 were occurringfrequently at financial institutions in a certain district within a largemetropolitan area, those financial institutions could be required to reportall their deposits, withdrawals, exchanges of currency or other paymentsor transfers involving a transaction in currency of more than $6,000 andless than $10,000.01 for a period of two weeks. In complying with a particular order, financial institutions will not berequired to purchase additional computer hardware or software. However,Treasury encourages financial institutions, wherever feasible, to adjustany existing computerized aggregation systems that they have in place inorder to capture the information specified in the order. In addition, thosefinancial institutions with manual aggregation systems should not haveany problems adjusting their manual systems in order to capture the datarequired to be reported in any geographic targeting order. Of course, ifa financial institution has knowledge through other means, <T3>e.g., </T3>the personal knowledge of a bank employee, that there areaggregated transactions falling within the limits described in the order,the financial institution will be required to report on those aggregatedtransactions, regardless of whether the existing system at the financialinstitution has the ability to identify the aggregated transactions. Finally,every effort will be made to work with those financial institutions filingmagnetically who receive a section 5326(a) order so as not to disrupt themagnetic media filing process. Geographic targeting orders will not be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. They will be issued only to the affected financialinstitutions. Issuance of a section 5326(a) order to a financial institutionwill not exempt that institution from its duty to report all over-$10,000currency transactions. The Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. Chapter 35, is inapplicableto orders issued under section 5326(a), as that information is requiredto be reported by law. 12 U.S.C. 3413. Therefore, targeted financial institutionsare not required to notify customers of their temporarily enhanced reportingrequirements. In order to ensure that the purpose of the order is not circumvented,Treasury normally would request that a financial institution subject toa geographic targeting order not notify the public of the enhanced reportingand recordkeeping requirement limits, but merely advise its customer atthe time of the transaction that the information sought is required byFederal regulation. It is anticipated that financial institutions will be directed to use Form4789, the Currency Transaction Report (CTR), currently used for reportingcurrency transactions over $10,000, in order to comply with a section 5326(a)order. In general, unless otherwise specified in the order, the provisionsof Part 103 relating to the reporting of currency transactions in excessof $10,000 would apply to reports filed on transactions falling withinthe scope of a section 5326(a) order. Unless otherwise noted in the order,it is anticipated that all existing exemptions granted by a targeted bankunder 31 CFR 103.22(b) prior to the time it received the order would continueto be utilized in complying with a section 5326(a) order. During the enhancedreporting period, no new exemptions could be granted to businesses thathave regular and frequent currency transactions in amounts either aboveor below $10,000, without the approval of Treasury. Finally, while thelegislation gives the Department the authority to include monetary instrumenttransaction reporting in such an order, it is anticipated that, as a generalrule, Treasury will use section 5326(a) orders to elicit reports on currencytransactions only.<ITAG tagnum="84">Submission of Comments</ITAG>Treasury requests comments from all interested persons concerning the proposedamendments. All comments received before the closing date will be carefullyconsidered. Oral comments must be reduced to writing and submitted to Treasuryto receive consideration. Comments received after the closing date andtoo late for consideration will be treated as possible suggestions forfuture action. The Treasury Department will not recognize any materialsor comments, including the name of any person submitting comments, as confidential.Any material not intended to be disclosed to the public should not be includedin comments. All comments submitted will be available for public inspectionduring the hours that the Treasury Library is open to the public.

It is not anticipated to have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more. It will not result in amajor increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions.
