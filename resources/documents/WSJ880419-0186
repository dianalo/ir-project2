Even at the low end of the Agriculture Department's forecast range, 1988's real net farm income (adjusted for inflation) would be $34 billion (in 1982 dollars) -- the highest level (with the exception of 1987's record) since 1979's $34.9 billion. Direct government payments are forecast to drop from $17 billion in 1987 to between $13 billion and $15 billion in 1988, according to USDA. These payments remain at massive levels. The safety net is hardly being pulled from under our farmers.    Why can these hefty government payments be reduced at this time? The answer is that the farm economy is recovering. USDA forecasts crop receipts to increase in 1988 to $62 billion to $65 billion from $59 billion in 1987. Total cash receipts are forecast to rise from $133 billion in 1987 to $134 billion to $139 billion in 1988. Crop prices are up almost across-the-board and farm exports have rebounded sharply. Although we are far from the heyday of the mid-1970s, conditions are improving.    Improved financial conditions combined with considerable pent-up demand have brightened the outlook for the farm-equipment industry. USDA forecasts capital expenditures in 1988 to be $7 billion to $9 billion, compared with $7 billion in 1987 -- ending an eight-year decline.    Farm debt continues to be liquidated and asset values are starting to rise, improving farmers' balance sheets. USDA estimates that farm-sector equity rose more than 6% in 1987 and forecasts another 1% to 4% rise in 1988.    There is no doubt that difficulties remain for many farmers and lenders. This should be expected as agriculture emerges from its worst depression since the 1930s. Still, positive signs abound.    Stephen C.
