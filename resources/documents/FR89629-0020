Statutory Authority</ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act (``SDWA`` or ``the Act''), as amended in 1986(Pub. L. No. 99-339, 100 Stat. 642), requires EPA to publish ``maximumcontaminant level goals'' (MCLGs) for contaminants which, in the judgmentof the Administrator, ``may have any adverse effect on the health of personsand which are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems.''Section 1412(b)(3)(A). MCLGs are to be set at a level at which ``no knownor anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and whichallows an adequate margin of safety.'' Section 1412(b)(4).At the same time EPA publishes an MCLG, which is a non-enforceable healthgoal, it also must promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation(NPDWR) which includes either (1) a maximum contaminant level (MCL), or(2) a required treatment technique. Section 1401(1), 1412(a)(3), and 1412(b)(7)(A).A treatment technique may be set only if it is not ``economically or technologicallyfeasible'' to ascertain the level of a contaminant. Sections 1401 (1) and1412(b)(7)(A). An MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible. Section1412(b)(4). Under the Act, ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use ofthe best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administratorfinds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solelyunder laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into consideration).''Section 1412(b)(5). The legislative history of SDWA indicates that EPAis to base MCLs on treatment technology affordable by large public watersystems with relatively clean source water supplies. 132 <T3>Cong. Rec</T3>. S6287 (daily ed., May 21, 1986). Each NPDWR which establishesan MCL must list the best available technology, treatment techniques, andother means which are feasible for meeting the MCL (BAT). Section 1412(b)(6).NPDWRs including monitoring and analytical requirements, specifically,``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinking water which dependablycomplies with such maximum contaminant levels . . .'' Section 1401(1)(D).Section 1445 also authorizes EPA to promulgate monitoring requirements.Section 1414(c) requires each owner or operator of a public water systemto give notice to persons served by it of (1) any failure to comply witha maximum contaminant level, treatment technique, or testing procedurerequired by a NPDWR; (2) any failure to comply with any monitoring requiredpursuant to section 1445 of the Act; (3) the existence of a variance ofexemption; or (4) any failure to comply with the requirements of any scheduleprescribed pursuant to a variance of exemption.Under the 1986 amendments to the SDWA, EPA was to promulgate NPDWRs for83 contaminants, in three phases, by June 19, 1989. A group of relatedbacteria known as total coliforms is one of the 83 contaminants which EPAmust regulate. Total coliforms include fecal coliforms and <T3>E. coli</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Final Rule</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Effective Date</T2>: December 31, 1990. Current rule remains in forceuntil December 31, 1990.<T3>Maximum Contaminant Level Goal</T3>: Zero.<T3>Maximum Contaminant Level</T3>andbullet; Compliance is based on presence/absence of total coliforms insample, rather than on an estimate of coliform density.andbullet; MCL for systems analyzing at least 40 samples/month: no more than5.0 percent of the monthly samples may be total coliform-positive.andbullet; MCL for systems analyzing fewer than 40 samples/month: no morethan 1 sample/month may be total coliform-positive.andbullet; A public water system must demonstrate compliance with the MCLfor total coliforms each month it is required to monitor. andbullet; MCL violations must be reported to the State no later than theend of the next business day after the system learns of the violation.Monitoring Requirements for Total Coliforms andbullet; Each public water system must sample according to a written samplesiting plan. Plans are subject to State review and revision. The Statemust establish a process which ensures the adequacy of the sample sitingplan for each system. andbullet; Monthly monitoring requirements are based on population served(see Table 1). andbullet; A system must collect a set of repeat samples for each total coliform-positiveroutine sample (see Table 2) and have it analyzed for total coliforms.At least one repeat sample must be from the same tap as the original sample;other repeat samples must be collected from within five service connectionsof the original sample. At least one must be upstream and another downstream.The system must collect all repeat samples within 24 hours of being notifiedof the original result, except where the State waives this requirementon a case-by-case basis. If a total coliform-positive sample is at theend of the distribution system, or one away from the end of the distributionsystem, the State may waive the requirement to collect at least one repeatsample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site. andbullet; If total coliforms are detected in any repeat sample, the systemmust collect another set of repeat samples, as before, unless the MCL hasbeen violated and the system has notified the State (in which case theState may reduce or eliminate the requirement to take the remaining repeatsamples).andbullet; If a system has only one service connection, the State has thediscretion to allow the system to either collect the required set of repeatsamples at the same tap over a four-day period or to collect a larger volumerepeat samples(s) (e.g., a single 400-ml sample). andbullet; If a system which collects fewer than five routine samples/monthdetects total coliforms in any routine or repeat sample (and the sampleis not invalidated by the State), it must collect a set of five routinesamples the next month the system provides water to the public, exceptthat the State may waive this requirement if (1) it performs a site visitto evaluate the contamination problem, or (2) it has determined why thesample was total coliform-positive and (a) this finding is documented inwriting, along with what action the system has taken or will take to correctthis problem before the end of the next month the system serves water tothe public, (b) this document is signed by the supervisor of the Stateofficial who makes the finding, (c) the documentation is made availableto EPA and the public, and (d) in certain cases (described in the rule),the system collects at least one additional sample. andbullet; Unfiltered surface water systems and systems using unfilteredground water under the direct influence of surface water must analyze onecoliform sample each day the turbidity of the source water exceeds oneNTU. (This sample counts toward the system's minimum monitoring requirements.)andbullet; Tables 1 and 2 summarize the routine and repeat sample monitoringrequirements for total coliforms.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Total Coliform Sampling Requirements, According to Population Served</T4><H1>Population served </H1><H1>Minimum number of routine samples per month\1\ </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">25 to 1,000\2\  <D>\3\ 1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 2,500 <D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,501 to 3,300 <D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,301 to 4,100 <D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4,101 to 4,900 <D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4,901 to 5,800 <D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,801 to 6,700 <D>7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6,701 to 7,600 <D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7,601 to 8,500 <D>9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8,501 to 12,900 <D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12,901 to 17,200 <D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">17,201 to 21,500 <D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21,501 to 25,000 <D>25 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,001 to 33,000 <D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">33,001 to 41,000 <D>40 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">41,001 to 50,000 <D>50 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,001 to 59,000 <D>60 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">59,001 to 70,000 <D>70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70,001 to 83,000 <D>80 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">83,001 to 96,000 <D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">96,001 to 130,000 <D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">130,001 to 220,000 <D>120 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">220,001 to 320,000 <D>150 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">320,001 to 450,000 <D>180 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">450,001 to 600,000 <D>210 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">600,001 to 780,000 <D>240 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">780,001 to 970,000 <D>270</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">970,001 to 1,230,000 <D>300 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,230,001 to 1,520,000 <D>330</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,520,001 to 1,850,000 <D>360 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,850,001 to 2,270,000 <D>390 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,270,001 to 3,020,000 <D>420 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,020,001 to 3,960,000 <D>450 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,960,001 or more <D>480 </D><F>\1\ In lieu of the frequency specified in this table, a non-communitywater system using only ground water (except ground water under the directinfluence of surface water) and serving 1,000 persons or fewer may monitorat a lesser frequency specified by the State (in writing) until a sanitarysurvey is conducted and the State reviews the results.

Thus, compliance with 40 CFR 141.71(b)alone does not constitute compliance with the sanitary survey requirementsof this coliform rule (141.21a(d), but a sanitary survey during a yearcan substitute for the annual on-site inspection for that year. </F><F>\2\ For a non-community water system which uses only protected and disinfectedground water, the sanitary survey may be repeated every ten years, insteadof every five years.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Fecal Coliforms/E. coli; Heterotrophic Bacteria (HPC) andbullet; If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, thesystem must analyze that total coliform-positive culture to determine iffecal coliforms are present, except that the system may test for <T3>E. coli </T3>in lieu of fecal coliforms. If fecal coliforms or <T3>E. coli </T3>are detected, the system must notify the State beforethe end of the same business day, or, if detected after the State officeis closed, by the end of the next business day.andbullet; If any repeat sample is fecal coliform-or <T3>E. coli-</T3>Positive, or if a fecal coliform-or <T3>E. coli</T3>-positive original sample is followed by a total coliform-positiverepeat sample, and the original total coliform-positive sample or the repeatsample is not invalidated, the system is in violation of the MCL for totalcoliforms. This is an acute violation of the MCL for total coliforms. andbullet; The State has the discretion to allow a water system, on a case-by-casebasis, to forgo fecal coliform or <T3>E. coli </T3>testing on total coliform-positive samples if the systemtreats every total coliform-positive sample as if it contained fecal coliforms,i.e., the system complies with all requirements which apply when a sampleis fecal coliform-positive.andbullet; State invalidation of a total coliform-positive sample invalidatessubsequent fecal coliform or <T3>E. coli</T3>-positive results on the same sample. andbullet; Heterotrophic bacteria can interfere with total coliform analysis.Therefore, if the total coliform sample produces: (1) A turbid culturein the absence of gas production using the Multiple Tube Fermentation (MTF)Technique; (2) a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction usingthe Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test; or (3) confluent growth or acolony number that is ``too numerous to count'' using the Membrance Filter(MF) Technique, the sample is invalid (unless total coliforms are detected,in which case, the sample is valid) and the system must, within 24 hoursof being notified of the result, collect another sample from the same locationas the original sample and have it analyzed for total coliforms. In suchcases, EPA recommends using media less prone to interference from heterotrophicbacteria for analyzing the replacement sample. The Sate may waive the 24-hourtime limit on a case-by-case basis. Analytical Methodology andbullet; Total coliform analyses are to be conducted using the 10-tubeMTF Technique, the MF Technique, the Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test,or the Minimal Media ONPG-MUG (MMO-MUG) Test (Autoanalysis Colilert System).A system may also use the 5-tube MTF Technique (using 20-ml sample portions)of a single culture bottle containing the MTF medium, as long as a 100-mlwater sample is used in the analysis.andbullet; A 100-ml standard sample volume must be used in analyzing fortotal coliforms, regardless of the analytical method used. andbullet; Fecal coliform analysis must be conducted using the method setout in the rule. andbullet; EPA will promulgate analytical methods of <T3>E. coli </T3>before the effective date of this rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Background</ITAG>A. Regulatory BackgroundAs required by the SDWA of 1974, on December 24, 1975, EPA published NationalInterim Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NIPDWRs). The NIPDWRs (renamed``national primary drinking water regulations''(NPDWRs) by the 1986 amendmentsto the Act) include requirements for total coliforms. See 40 CFR 141.14and 141.21. EPA based these requirements, including the MCL and the monitoringfrequency, on the U.S. Public Health Service drinking water regulationsof 1962. The NPDWR for coliforms, which is still in effect, applies toboth community water systems (systems which serve year-round residents)and non-community water systems (all other systems). Currently there areapproximately 60,000 community water systems and 143,000 non-communitywater systems.Despite existing drinking water regulations, waterborne disease outbreakscontinue to occur. For example, between 1971 and 1983 there were 427 reportedoutbreaks with over 100,000 cases of waterborne disease. However, EPA believesthe vast majority of waterborne disease outbreaks and cases are not reported.Few States have an active outbreak surveillance program, and disease outbreaksare often not recognized in a community or, if recognized, are not tracedto the drinking water source. One EPA-funded study in Colorado found thatonly about one-quarter of the waterborne disease outbreaks were being recognizedand reported (Hopkins et al., 1985).The under-reporting may be even more serious, according to the resultsof several other studies. For instance, Hauchild and Bryan (1980) reportthat the ratio of all outbreaks to reported outbreaks for waterborne andfoodborne disease may be 25:1. Another study (Archer and Kvenberg, 1985)suggests under-reporting of an order of magnitude even greater than Hauchildand Bryan.EPA believes that a major factor in the failure to recognize waterbornedisease outbreaks is that the vast majority of people experiencing gastroenteritis,some of which may be waterborne in origin, do not seek medical attention,and physicians generally cannot attribute gastroenteritis to any specificsource. The Agency also understands that, in some States, a lack of communicationbetween agencies responsible for public health and water supply createsan obstacle to reliable waterborne disease outbreak recognition and reporting.Based on this information, EPA believes that the number of cases of waterbornedisease is much higher (as many as ten to several hundred-fold higher)than is actually recognized and recorded. The Agency believes that thenumber of actual outbreaks and cases of disease is unacceptably higherand therefore additional measures are needed for further control. Someof these measures are incorporated into the revised coliform rule describedin this notice. Other measures are incorporated into the surface watertreatment requirements, also promulgated in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> EPA believes that this revised total coliformrule, including the revised MCL and requirements for monitoring, sanitarysurveys for systems collecting fewer than five samples/month, State reviewof sample siting plans, and fecal coliform or <T3>E. coli</T3> testing, together with the surface water treatment requirements,and forthcoming groundwater disinfection requirements (also required bythe 1986 SDWA amendments) will decrease the risk of waterborne illness,compared to the current rule.On November 3, 1987, EPA proposed to amend the national primary drinkingwater regulation for total coliforms (52 FR 42224). On May 6, 1988, EPAsolicited specific data, offered additional regulatory options for comment,and clarified and corrected statements made in the November 3, 1987, proposal(53 FR 16348). The public comment period closed on July 5, 1988. Threepublic hearings were held, two in Washington, DC, on November 23, 1987and June 27, 1988, and one in Denver, Colorado on December 2-3, 1987. OnSeptember 28, 1988, EPA made available to the public draft outline whichsummarized the provisions which the Agency was considering including inthe final rule for total coliforms (53 FR 37801).B. Public Comments on the ProposalEPA requested comments on all aspects of both the November 3, 1987, proposaland May 6, 1988, notice of availability. The description of the final ruleprovisions in the following sections includes summaries of the major publiccomments and the Agency's response to the issues raised. A detailed recitationof the comments and the Agency's responses are presented in the ``Comment/ResponseDocument for the Proposed Coliform Rule,'' which is available in the publicdocket.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Explanation of Final Provisions</ITAG>A. Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)As explained in the November 3, 1987, notice, total coliform levels havebeen used for decades as the primary measure of the microbial quality ofdrinking water. Coliforms are usually present in water contaminated withhuman and animal feces and are often associated with outbreaks of disease.Although total coliforms are usually not pathogenic themselves, their presencein drinking water indicates that fecal pathogens may also be present. EPAbelieves that treatment which provides total coliform-free water will reducefecal pathogens to minimal levels.On November 13, 1985 (50 FR 46902), EPA proposed a recommended maximumcontainment level (RMCL), renamed maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG)by the 1986 SDWA amendments, for total coliforms of zero. Since then, the1986 amendments streamlined the rulemaking process. Under the amended Act,EPA must propose both the MCLG and the NPDWR for a contaminant simultaneously,and it then must publish the MCLG and promulgate the NPDWR simultaneously.Section 1412(a)(3). To bring the rulemaking for total coliforms in linewith the amended process, in the November 3, 1987 notice, EPA reproposedthe RMCL as an MCLG at the same level, i.e., zero, on the same basis setout in the November 1985 notice and in the Criteria Document for TotalColiforms (USEPA, 1984).The majority of comments addressing the proposed MCLG supported the proposedvalue of zero. No commenter suggested another value. Some commenters questionedthe rationale for using total coliforms as the primary tool to assess themicrobiological quality of drinking water; a few of these commenters statedthat it was inappropriate to set an MCLG for coliforms since coliformsare not generally pathogenic.After reviewing the comments in response to both the November 1985 andNovember 1987 proposals, EPA has decided to promulgate an MCLG of zerofor total coliforms, as proposed. Because fecal coliforms and <T3>E. coli</T3> are a subset of the total coliform group, the MCLG fortotal coliforms includes these organisms. The Agency is not aware of anydata in the scientific literature supporting a particular value for coliformdensity, below which there are no known or anticipated adverse health effects,with an adequate margin of safety. In fact, waterborne disease outbreaksand specific pathogen levels have been associated with coliform densitiesfrom less than one/100 ml to very high levels.It is important to note that SDWA specifically requires EPA to regulatetotal coliforms, and that coliform analysis, along with sanitary surveys,have been the foundation of programs to assure a sanitary water supplyfor many decades. By proposing and publishing an MCLG of zero, EPA is statingthat, conceptually, coliforms should not be present in drinking water,because they may indicate the presence of pathogenic organisms in the water.Regulation of total coliforms is not the only tool EPA is using to assessand assure the microbiological quality of water. For example, the Agencyis also using specified surface water treatment requirements (publishedelsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), and the forthcoming groundwater disinfectionrequirements for this purpose.B. Maximum Contaminant Level<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Presence-Absence Concept</ITAG>The November 3, 1987, notice proposed that coliform MCLs be based on theirpresence or absence in a water sample rather than on an estimation of coliformdensity, as is the case with the current coliform rule. The Agency receiveda number of comments on this issue. Many commenters supported the presence-absenceconcept over a density determination. Almost all of those commenters whoopposed the presence-absence concept prefer to retain the current coliformrule because they believe it has been effective (e.g., they believe therehave been no or few waterborne disease outbreaks in their State or community).However, as stated above, EPA believes that the number of outbreaks andcases of waterborne disease is much higher than is recognized and recorded,and therefore more effective measures are needed for further control.As explained in the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA believes the presence-absenceconcept is simpler and mathematically more precise than the current densitystandard for total coliforms, and therefore has decided to use presence-absenceas the basis for the coliform MCL in this revised rule. The advantagesof the presence-absence concept include the following: (1) It is easierto determine the presence or absence of coliforms than to determine theirdensity, (2) the presence-absence determination is less influenced by sampletransit time than a density determination, and (3) use of the presence-absenceconcept eliminates calculation difficulties implicit in the statisticalmethodology of coliform density calcualtions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Monthly MCL</ITAG>The November 3, 1987, notice proposed a monthly MCL for all community andnon-community public water systems. The monthly MCL was designed to preventadverse health effects by providing high quality water on a consistentbasis. Under the proposal, for public water systems that analyzed fewerthan 40 samples/month for total coliforms, more than one total coliform-positivesample/month would violate the monthly MCL. For systems that analyzed 40or more samples/month for total coliforms, the occurrence of total coliformsin more than five percent of the samples would violate the monthly MCL.The majority of commenters supported the proposed monthly MCL, while afew preferred retention of the current MCLs, which are based on coliformdensity. For the reasons explained in the November 3 notice, EPA believesthe proposed monthly MCL is more scientifically defensible than the currentcoliform MCLs. As explained in that notice, given that total coliformsare ubiquitous in water, EPA believes that an infrequent single coliform-positivesample does not necessarily represent a health risk. For this reason, theAgency has decided to promulgate the monthly MCL as proposed. EPA has concludedthat the final MCL is as close to the final MCLG of zero as is feasible.EPA has clarified rounding-off procedures for the MCL by specifying thatno more than 5.0 percent, rather than 5 percent, of the samples analyzedduring a month may be total coliform-positive for systems collecting atleast 40 samples/month to be in compliance. Thus, a system which collects75 samples/month would violate the MCL if four samples were coliform-positive,i.e., 4/75 = 5.3 percent, because it is greater than 5.0 percent.EPA has also more clearly defined the compliance period for this rule byspecifying that a public water system must demonstrate compliance withthe MCL for total coliforms each month it is required to monitor. Thus,a system which collects fewer than 40 samples/month will be in compliancewith the MCL if fewer than two samples during a month are total coliform-positive.On the other hand, if one sample is total coliform-positive during eachof two or more consecutive months, the system remains in compliance withthe MCL.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Long-term MCL</ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed a long-term MCL in additionto the monthly MCL. For systems collecting fewer than 60 samples/year,no more than five percent of the most recent 60 samples could be totalcoliform-positive. For systems collecting at least 60 samples/year, nomore than five percent of the total number of samples collected duringthe most recent 12 months could be total coliform-positive. The rationalefor the proposed long-term MCL was presented in the November 3, 1987, notice.The May 6, 1988, notice requested public comment on various alternativesto the long-term MCL, including limiting the time-frame for determiningcompliance with the long-term MCL to one year for all systems and deletingthe long-term MCL entirely but specifying that the States require systemsto take one or more specific actions (e.g., perform a sanitary survey,issue a boil water notice, disinfect continuously), on a case-by-case basis,whenever the number of total coliform-positive samples from a system exceededfive percent of the total number of samples during a specified time period.The majority of commenters addressing the proposed long-term MCL opposedit; primarily, they were concerned that long-term compliance tracking ofsmall systems by the State would be difficult, and that a small systemmight find itself in violation of the long-term MCL long after a transientcontamination problem had been corrected. The Agency believes that controlof intermittent contamination (i.e., across several compliance periods)is important for ensuring safe drinking water, and that national regulationsto address this problem may be appropriate. However, it is difficult todevise a practical approach for collecting and processing the amount ofdata necessary to detect intermittent contamination. Thus, EPA has decidednot to promulgate a long-term MCL at this time. It is important to note,however, that other measures, such as the surface water treatment requirementsin Part 141, Subpart H (published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), will reduce intermittent contamination. Similarly,the forthcoming Congressionally-mandated regulation requiring disinfectionas a treatment technique for all public water systems using ground waterwill also reduce intermittent contamination. Moreover, as described below,today's rule requires a system to perform additional monitoring after itdetects a total coliform-positive sample, which will have the effect ofidentifying systems with intermittent contamination. In addition, the Statehas the authority to establish additional requirements to identify systemswith intermittent contamination and to require corrective action.C. Monitoring RequirementsA system which has failed to comply with a coliform monitoring requirement(including, but not limited to, a sample siting plan requirement, a sanitarysurvey requirement, a routine sample requirement, a repeat sample requirement,and a fecal coliform/<T3>E. coli</T3> test requirement) must report the monitoring violationto the State within ten days after the system discovers the violation,and notify the public in accordance with andSection; 141.32 (the generalpublic notification requirements).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Basis: Population Served vs. Other Alternatives</ITAG>The November 3, 1987, notice proposed to retain population as the basisfor setting monitoring frequency. There were very few public comments onthis issue. Most of the commenters who discussed the basis for monitoringfrequency, however, supported the concept proposed. Based on the publiccomments and the reasons explained in the November 3, 1987, notice, EPAhas retained population as the basis for setting monitoring frequency.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sampling Sites</ITAG>The interim regulations state that samples are to be taken at points representativeof conditions within the distribution system. The November 3, 1987, noticeproposed to refine this provision by requiring systems to collect samplesfrom at least three times the number of sites every year as the numberof monthly samples required or the total number of service connections.In addition, EPA recommended, but did not propose, that systems selectnew sampling sites every year. The intent of these provisions was to insurethat the system would eventually collect samples from all major sectionsof the distribution system.EPA received numerous comments on this issue. Most commenters opposed theproposed requirement. Many commenters claimed that the increase in thenumber of sampling sites would force systems to use private homes, withpossible problems of access, or that the requirement would preclude systemsfrom monitoring water quality at specific representative sites over time,which would prevent collection of historical data and trend information.A number of commenters recommended that EPA allow all, or at least some,sampling sites, to be fixed.EPA has decided to replace the proposed approach with an alternative presentedin the May 6, 1988, notice. This alternative, which would require the systemto use a sample siting plan acceptable to the State, was supported by manycommenters. Thus, under the final rule, each system must develop and monitoraccording to a written sample siting plan, which is subject to State reviewand revision. The State must develop and implement a process which ensuresthe adequacy of the sample siting plan for each public water system inthe State, including periodic review of each system's plan. For the vastmajority of systems, EPA expects the State will conduct this periodic reviewas part of the periodic sanitary survey. The siting plan should ensurethat the system will eventually detect contamination in any portion ofthe distribution system if it is present. While reviewing the siting plan,the State should also review the sample collection timing patterns foreach system to determine whether the system should collect samples on aregular basis throughout the month, or whether it is acceptable to collectsome or all required samples at the same time.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Sanitary Surveys</ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA proposed to require all systems thatexercised the Agency's option for collecting fewer than five samples/monthto have a periodic sanitary survey at the frequency shown in Table 1 ofthe proposed rule. The May 6, 1988, notice requested public comment onwhether EPA should specify a date by which the initial sanitary surveyswere to be performed, and, if so, what this date should be, and whetherthis initial time period or the time period between sanitary surveys shoulddepend on system size or system type.Many commenters supported the concept of a periodic sanitary survey. Althoughthe proposed rule put the burden to complete the sanitary survey on thesystem rather than the State, many of these commenters assumed that manyStates would very likely choose to perform all or most sanitary surveysthemselves, and they questioned whether resources would allow the Stateto perform the sanitary surveys in the time frame specified in the proposedrule. Some commenters indicated that sanitary surveys should be performedno less than every five years. Others suggested that the frequency of sanitarysurveys be left to State discretion. Some commenters thought that, givenresource limitations, EPA or the States should set priorities among differentcategories of systems for completing sanitary surveys.EPA believes that sanitary surveys and action to correct any defects identifiedin the course of the surveys are indispensable for assuring the long-termquality and safety of drinking water in systems which collect fewer thanfive samples/month. Monitoring and sanitary surveys complement each otherto achieve this result. Therefore, to ensure that sanitary surveys areperformed regularly, in this final rule, EPA is specifying the maximumallowable time for the system to complete both the initial sanitary surveyand subsequent surveys. EPA expects that many States will perform mostor all of the sanitary surveys themselves, and recognizes that, becauseof resource constraints, they cannot perform the surveys all at once; thus,it is appropriate to set priorities. Moreover, because the final rule generallyretains the monitoring frequency of the interim rule, rather than adoptingthe frequency in the proposed rule, EPA anticipates that many more systemswill sample fewer than five times/month than was contemplated under theproposed rule. Thus, the Agency believes it appropriate to increase thetime between sanitary surveys, compared to what was proposed, and staggerthe deadlines because of State resource constraints. The sanitary surveyrequirements of the final rule appear in Table 3.As Table 3 indicates, the initial sanitary surveys must be completed withinfive years of promulgation of this rule for community water systems, andwithin ten years of promulgation for non-community water systems. Table3 also shows the schedule for subsequent surveys, which is either everyfive or ten years, depending on the type of system.The sanitary survey frequencies in Table 3 take into account the fact thatthere is lower potential health risk associated with ground water systemswhich disinfect than with other systems. This schedule also takes intoaccount that there are two to three times as many non-community water systemsas community water systems and, as a result, more time will be necessaryto complete sanitary surveys for the non-community systems. Although sanitarysurveys are already being performed in many States (EPA data indicate thatin FY 1987, States collectively performed about 35,000 on-site evaluations),EPA recognizes that a number of States will need some period of time toestablish a mechanism for ensuring that sanitary surveys are conductedfor the thousands of affected systems in the State. Given these considerations,EPA believes the required frequencies for sanitary surveys are reasonable.Under this rule, the system is responsible for insuring that the sanitarysurvey is accomplished. Only the State or an agent approved by the Statemay conduct a sanitary survey. States are required to review the resultsof each sanitary survey to determine whether the existing monitoring frequencyis still appropriate, and if not, what the new frequency should be, andwhether the system needs to undertake any specific measures to improvewater quality. EPA intends to provide guidance on the design and implementationof sanitary surveys and other site-specific evaluations.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Invalidation of Total Coliform-Positive Samples</ITAG>The November 3, 1987 notice proposed that all coliform-positive samplesbe used in determining MCL compliance, unless the laboratory establishesthat improper sample analysis caused the positive result. Several commenterssuggested that the State be allowed to invalidate total coliform-positivesamples in certain other situations as well.EPA is aware that a number of States and systems currently invalidate atotal coliform-positive sample on the basis of subsequent ``check'' sampleswhich are total coliform-negative. In other words, when subsequent repeatsamples at the same and/or nearby taps/service connections are total coliform-negative,it is assumed that the original total coliform-positive sample resultedfrom a domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem or impropersample collection and handling. Consequently, they invalidate the originaltotal coliform-positive sample. EPA believes there is no valid justificationfor using coliform-negative check samples alone to invalidate an initialcoliform-positive sample.As indicated in the November 3, 1987, notice, Pipes and Christian (1982)and Christian and Pipes (1983) have shown that the distribution of coliformsin the distribution system is far from being uniform. Hence, repeat samplesalone are not adequate to determine the validity of a total coliform-positivesample. Even if a repeat sample is taken from the same sampling tap asthe total coliform-positive sample, the results of the analysis of therepeat sample will not necessarily be representative of conditions whenthe original sample was taken. Therefore, under this final rule, Statesmay not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample simply because a subsequentsample taken at the same tap and/or nearby taps/service connections aretotal coliform-negative. However, EPA believes that if any repeat sampleis total coliform-positive at the same tap as the original total coliform-positivesample, but all repeat samples at nearby service connections are totalcoliform-negative, this is a strong indication of a domestic or other non-distributionsystem plumbing problem. Therefore, in this case, the final rule allowsthe State to invalidate the original total coliform-positive sample. Whenthe State determines that a coliform-positive result is a domestic or othernon-distribution system plumbing problem rather than a distribution systemproblem, EPA recommends that the State instruct the system to inform allconsumers at the affected location of the problem and to advise them toboil their drinking water until the problem is corrected.This rule also provides the State discretion to invalidate a total coliform-positivesample when it determines that a total coliform-positive result is dueto a circumstance or condition which does not reflect water quality inthe distribution system. States should use their discretion to invalidatea sample on this basis sparingly. They should hesitate to assume that anerror by the sample collector is responsible for a total coliform-positivesample, and thus invalidate the sample, since Pipes and Christian (1982)have shown that contamination by a sample collector is unlikely to be thecause of a total coliform-positive result, i.e., it is unlikely that aperson who collects samples can unintentionally render a sample total coliform-positive.Whenever a State official invalidates a sample for this reason, the basisfor this determination must be documented in writing, signed by the supervisorof the State official who makes this determination, and the documentationmust be made available to EPA and the public. The written documentationmust include the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample,and what action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem.The State cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample under thisprovision unless all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. Statescannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample <T3>solely </T3>on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.The final rule also allows the State to invalidate a total coliform-positivesample if the laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis causedthe positive result.The State may not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample for any otherreason than those described above. A total coliform-positive sample invalidatedfor any of the above reasons does not count towards meeting the minimummonitoring requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Monitoring Frequency</ITAG>a. <T3>Monitoring frequency for small community water systems and all non-communitywater systems</T3>_(1) <T3>General. </T3>The November 3, 1987, notice proposed to require allpublic water systems serving 3,300 persons or fewer to collect and analyzea minimum of five total coliform samples/month. As explained in that notice,EPA's primary rationale for this higher level of monitoring, compared tothe requirements of the current total coliform rule, is based on the studywhich demonstrated that coliforms are distributed very unevenly in distributionsystems (Pipes and Christian, 1982; Christian and Pipes, 1983). To reducethe economic burden of additional monitoring on small systems, while stillassuring reasonable protection of public health, EPA proposed to allowcertain systems to monitor less frequently than five samples/month, ifthe State, or an agent acceptable to the State, performed a periodic sanitarysurvey and the results of that survey were acceptable to the State.EPA received numerous comments on this issue. The vast majority opposedthe proposed monitoring frequency, primarily because they believed therequirement would be too expensive, too inconvenient, and/or unnecessarybecause their systems had never had a waterborne disease outbreak or anyother contamination problem. The Agency continues to believe, however,given the scientific data, that the monitoring requirements of the interimregulations, alone, are not adequate to fully assess the microbiologicalquality of drinking water. In response to the extensive comments, therefore,EPA solicited comments in the May 6, 1988, notice on several additionaloptions for ensuring adequate monitoring, without a large increase in costs.In response to the public comments on the two notices, the Agency has decided,for small systems, to place less emphasis on collecting many routine samplesevery month when there is no apparent problem (based on the results ofthe sanitary survey, historical monitoring data, and other considerations)and greater emphasis on evaluating the severity and extent of any contaminationproblem when it does occur and the success of any corrective action (asindicated by coliform monitoring results). To this end, EPA has generallyretained the monitoring frequency specified in the interim rule (40 CFR141.21) for systems serving 4100 persons or fewer (see Table 1), exceptthat increased monitoring is required, at least temporarily, when contaminationis found. Thus, under the final rule, when contamination is found, i.e.,there is a total coliform-positive sample in the community or non-communitywater system normally collecting fewer than five samples/month, that systemmust collect three or four repeat samples, depending on the system's size(see Section IV.C.5.c, below) and, if the original sample is not invalidated,at least five routine samples the next month the water system is in operation.If these repeat and additional routine samples are total coliform-negative,the system may revert to the regular frequency of less than five samples/month.(The State, or an agent of the State, may perform an on-site evaluationin lieu of the system taking five routine samples the next month, as explainedin greater detail below.) By retaining the current monitoring frequencyfor small systems, and requiring additional samples only when a systemdetects contamination, systems and States can concentrate their limitedresources on identifying and correcting problems, rather than simply requiringthat many more samples are collected across the board.An integral part of this approach is the periodic sanitary survey requirement.The Agency believes that a system collecting fewer than five samples/monthdoes not have an adequate grasp on the quality of its drinking water unlessthis limited sampling is supplemented by a periodic sanitary survey, andthe results are reviewed by the State. These sanitary surveys, along withadditional information such as the system's history of coliform monitoringresults, should provide the State with sufficient information to judgewhether a system is adequately constructed and operated or has a potentialcontamination problem. For systems collecting fewer than five samples/month,the total coliform samples will serve as a periodic check of the findingsof the most recent sanitary survey. States would be expected to increasethe monitoring frequency and/or require various preventive measures fora particular system if coliforms are detected or if the most recent sanitarysurvey reveals deficiencies. EPA believes this approach will minimize thefinancial burden to small systems which do not have an apparent contaminationproblem, while safeguarding public health, by ensuring these systems aresubject to periodic sanitary surveys and increasing the monitoring requirementsfor systems with demonstrated problems. Regarding the appropriate timing for collecting water samples, in the November3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed to require systems to collect water samplesat regular time intervals throughout the month, except that systems whichused ground water exclusively and which served 3,300 persons or fewer couldcollect up to five samples from different parts of the distribution systemon a single day. Very few commenters addressed this issue. EPA has decidedto promulgate this provision as proposed for the reasons given in the November3 notice, except that, to be consistent with the population categoriesused in this final rule, the rule provides that systems using ground waterand serving 4,900 persons or fewer may collect all required samples fromdifferent parts of the distribution system on a single day.(2) <T3>Non-community water systems. </T3>The interim regulations at andSection;141.21(c) provide the State discretion to allow a non-community publicwater system to monitor less than quarterly, based on the results of asanitary survey. The final rule retains this provision only for non-communitywater systems which use ground water and which serve 1,000 persons or fewer.The Agency, believes, however, that all systems must perform at least somemonitoring to insure the continuing validity of the most recent sanitarysurvey results and the actual absence of coliforms. Thus, the final rulerequires non-community systems using ground water and serving 1,000 personsor fewer to collect at least one total coliform sample per year. The Agencybelieves this requirement is reasonable, and represents the bare minimumthat is adequate for protection of public health. EPA also believes thatthis provision will not impose a financial burden on non-community systemsor on States which collect and analyze samples for non-community systems.For States already requiring at least quarterly monitoring for such systems,the Agency encourages them to continue this policy. Some States, however,have not required their non-community systems to monitor at all under theinterim regulations, while others require monitoring less frequently thanannually, and thus will probably need some lead time to develop resourcesto implement the new provision requiring, at a minimum, annual monitoring.For this reason EPA is phasing in the new monitoring frequency requirements.A non-community water system using ground water (which is not under thedirect influence of surface water) and serving 1,000 persons or fewer mustbegin monitoring no later than five years from June 29, 1989, and at leastannually thereafter. The Agency believes this phase-in period is amplefor States and systems to implement this requirement.EPA believes these small groundwater systems, which tend to have good qualitysource water and be simpler in configuration, are less likely to developcontamination problems. EPA is not allowing surface water systems to monitoronly annually, however, because surface water often varies in quality andis much more likely to contain coliforms; thus reduced monitoring is unwarranted.Accordingly, non-community water systems using surface water must monitorat the same frequency as a like-sized community water system, i.e., atthe frequency specified in Table 1. For the same reason, non-communitywater systems using ground water under the direct influence of surfacewater must also monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized communitywater system. The final rule allows such a groundwater system six monthsafter the State determines that the system is under the direct influenceof surface water to begin monitoring at this frequency. EPA is also requiring non-community systems using ground water servingmore than 1,000 persons during any months to monitor at the same frequencyas a like-sized community public water system since a greater number ofpeople are at risk if there is contamination of the system, and since thesesystems are likely to be larger and more complex, resembling communitywater systems in size and configuration. Under this rule, however, theState may reduce the monitoring frequency, as appropriate, for such a systemfor any month the system serves 1,000 persons or fewer.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,s100,r100,r100,r100</C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Monitoring Frequency for Non-Community Water Systems \1\</T4><H1>Water source</H1><H1>Population served</H1><H1>Minimum monitoring frequency</H1><H1>Effective date of requirement</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Surface <D>any </D><D>Same as CWS \2\ </D><D>Beginning December 31, 1990.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ground <D>1</D>andCx.170;1,000 <D>Same as CWS,\2\ \3\ </D><D>Beginning December 31, 1990.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ground <D/>andCx.170;1,000 <D>State discretion </D><D>December 31, 1990 until June 29, 1994.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ground <D/>andCx.170;1,000 <D>State discretion \4\ </D><D>After June 29, 1994.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ground water under direct influence of surface water <D>Any </D><D>Same as CWS \2\ </D><D>Within one year of State of State classification.</D><F>\1\ Includes both transient and non-transient non-community water systems.</F><F>\2\ System must monitor at same frequency as a like-sized communitywater system.</F><F>\3\ State may reduce the monitoring frequency for any month the systemserves 1,000 persons or fewer.</F><F>\4\ State may not permit a system to monitor less than once per year.</F></ITAG></ITAG>b. <T3>Monitoring frequency for large community water systems. </T3>The November3, 1987, notice proposed to retain the current monitoring frequency forsystems which serve greater than 3,300 persons, except that EPA proposedto reduce the number of population size categories for communities above10,000 from 84 to 43 to simplify and streamline the monitoring frequencyrequirements. As a consequence of consolidation, some systems would have been requiredto take a few more samples than they are currently taking. Although therewere very few public comments on this issue, a few commenters stated thatthere was no need for these additional samples. EPA agrees. Therefore,in the final rule, EPA has modified the categories so no system is requiredto increase its routine sampling frequency above that in the interim coliformrule. With this modification, shown in Table 1, the monitoring scheme inthis rule is even simpler; the total number of population categories hasbeen reduced from 84 to 34.c. <T3>Repeat samples/additional routine samples. </T3>The November 3, 1987,notice proposed that public water systems collect five repeat samples foreach total coliform-positive routine or repeat sample if the positive routineor repeat sample did not contain fecal coliforms. The May 6, 1988, noticedescribed several alternatives to the requirement for five repeat samples,including four repeat samples, two repeat samples, and four repeat samplesfor systems collecting fewer than five samples/month and two repeat samplesfor systems collecting at least five samples/month.EPA received many comments on the required number of repeat samples. Mostcommenters who addressed this issue opposed the requirement for five repeatsamples because of the cost or because they thought that five repeat sampleswere simply unnecessary. Many of these commenters thought that two repeatsamples, as specified in the current rule, are adequate.As stated in the November 3, 1987, proposal, given the non-uniform distributionof total coliforms in the distribution system, EPA does not believe thattwo repeat samples are sufficient to assess the extent or degree of contamination.Furthermore, as described above, the fact that a total coliform-positivesample is followed by two negative samples at the same or nearby samplingpoint does not necessarily mean there is no contamination in the systemand, thus, that the original positive sample is invalid. Yet, EPA alsorecognizes that five repeat samples for systems collecting more than fivesamples/month probably is unnecessary, given that such systems are likelyto detect and confirm the presence of any contamination in the course ofthe more frequent routine monitoring required by the rule. For this reason,EPA has decided to require these larger systems to collect only three repeatsamples, one at the same tap as the original coliform-positive sample,one at a tap within five service connections upstream, and one at a tapwithin five service connections downstream of the original sampling site.EPA believes that, for these systems, these extra samples, in conjunctionwith routine monitoring, will allow the system and the State to determinethe source and extent of any contamination.In addition, EPA has decided to require systems collecting two, three,or four routine samples/month to collect three repeat samples, and systemscollecting one sample/month or fewer to collect four repeat samples, fora total of five or more samples, whenever a total coliform-positive sampleis found. Also, as indicated previously, whenever a total coliform-positivesample is detected and the State does not invalidate it, any system collectingfewer than five routine samples/month (``small system'') must collect atleast five routine samples the next month it serves water to the public,even if the MCL is not violated. To meet this requirement, a small systemmay count any routine sample it normally collects the next month it serveswater to the public toward this set of five routine samples, i.e., if asmall system normally collects one sample/month, it need only collect fouradditional routine samples the next month it serves water to the public;if a system normally collects five or more samples/month, it need not collectany additional samples the next month it serves water to the public. Underthese requirements, a small system with a total coliform-positive samplewill have the results from at least five samples during the month whenthe total coliform-positive sample was detected, and five more the nextmonth is serves water to the public, for a total of ten samples over thetwo-month period. This repeat sample requirement should not be a burdento most systems, since repeat samples count toward the monthly monitoringrequirement. (Routine samples differ from repeat samples in that systemsmay collect routine samples at any tap in the distribution system, consistentwith the sampling siting plan, while repeat samples must be collected atspecific locations.)The primary reason for requiring a contaminated small system to collectat least ten samples during a two-month period is based on the statisticalanalysis described in the November 3, 1987, notice which indicates that,for example, if 60 or more samples are collected and 95 percent or moreare total coliform-negative, there is a 95 percent confidence that thefraction of water with coliforms present is less than 10 percent. By collectingat least five samples (routine plus repeat samples) during the month whena total coliform-positive sample is found, and five additional routinesamples the next month the system serves water to the public, these smallsystems will more quickly collect an increasingly valid number of samplesupon which to assess both the effectiveness of any corrective action takenand the current microbiological quality of its water, even in the absenceof a recent sanitary survey. The Agency believes this would also providethe system a larger, and thus more valid, data set than most systems wouldhave taken under the proposed requirement (which would have required fivesamples/month but allowed reductions based on sanitary survey results).EPA concludes that it is important to temporarily require increased monitoringfor small systems where the water quality is suspect (especially sincesanitary surveys will be performed only every five years or less), andthat these requirements are consistent with comments suggesting that increasedmonitoring is not necessary in systems that are not experiencing problems.In addition, these provisions have many of the same benefits of the proposedlong-term MCL. EPA is concerned that, in small systems, intermittent contaminationcould go undetected if a system monitors infrequently, and regularly hasone total coliform-positive sample, since this would not result in an MCLviolation. However, a contaminated small system which collects a set ofrepeat samples during the same month it finds a total coliform-positivesample and at least five routine samples the next month it serves waterto the public has a higher probability of detecting more than one totalcoliform-positive sample during a month, and thus incurring an MCL violation.As a result, this monitoring scheme is more likely to result in the discoveryand correction of intermittent contamination problems.The final rule allows the State to waive the requirement for a small systemto collect five routine samples the next month it serves water to the publicif the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visitbefore the end of the month during which the system would otherwise berequired to collect the five routine samples. The site visit need not bea complete or formal sanitary survey; the purpose is to investigate first-handthe reason for the total coliform-positive result, and decide whether anyadditional monitoring and corrective action is needed. The State cannotapprove an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if theemployee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary surveys.The rule also allows the State to waive the requirement that a small systemtake five routine samples the next month it serves water to the publicafter it has a total coliform-positive sample if the State has determinedwhy the sample was total coliform-positive, and establishes that the systemhas corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end ofthe next month the system serves water to the public. In this case, theState must document this decision to waive the monitoring requirement inwriting. This document must be signed by the supervisor of the State officialwho recommends such a decision, and made available to EPA and the public.The written documentation must state the specific cause of the total coliform-positivesample, and what action the system has taken or will take to correct thisproblem before the end of the next month the system serves water to thepublic. The State cannot waive the requirement for a small system to collectfive routine samples the next month after it has a total coliform-positivesample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples were total coliform-negative.In addition, the State cannot waive the requirement for a system to collectrepeat samples the same month the system has a total coliform-positivesample.For systems collecting fewer than five routine samples/month, if the Statedecides to waive the requirement for that system to collect five routinesamples the next month the system serves water to the public under theprovision described in the previous paragraph, the system must still collectat least one routine sample before the end of the next month the systemserves water to the public if the system collected the required set ofrepeat samples before the problem was corrected. This routine sample, whichcounts in determining compliance with the MCL, will assist the system indetermining whether the corrective action has been successful. If sucha system collects the required repeat samples after correcting the problem,and all repeat samples are total coliform-negative, then the system neednot collect a routine sample the next month it serves water to the public.In this case, EPA believes the repeat sample results are sufficient toindicate the success of any corrective action. If any repeat sample istotal coliform-positive, the system is out of compliance with the MCL fortotal coliforms.Table 2 summarizes the follow-up (both repeat and routine) sampling requirementsfor a system which detects total coliforms in a sample.The November 3, 1987, notice proposed that data from all routine samplesand repeat samples be included in the calculations to determine MCL compliance.A number of commenters approved this approach, but the majority opposedit. Reasons given for opposing this approach included the following: (1)Repeat samples should not be used to determine compliance, but only toconfirm the results of an original coliform-positive sample; (2) the useof results from repeat samples to determine compliance would reduce thelevel of monitoring in the rest of the system, since all of the samplescollected at or near the problem tap would fulfill (or nearly fulfill)the monthly monitoring requirements; and (3) contamination in a singlelocation of the distribution system might result in an MCL violation ifone or more repeat samples were total coliform-positive, even though theremight not be a system-wide problem.EPA believes the first comment is invalid because, as described above andin the November 3, 1987, notice, total coliforms are not distributed unformlyin the distribution system, and thus, repeat samples cannot be used toconfirm a total coliform-positive routine sample. As for the other tworeasons, EPA believes it makes sense to focus sampling at or near the siteof the original total coliform-positive sample, given the documented non-uniformdistribution of coliforms, and to consider all samples that are not invalidatedin determining whether a system is in compliance with the MCL. Hence, forthe reasons discussed above and in the November 3, 1987, notice, the Agencyhas incorporated the proposed method for calculating compliance, i.e.,inclusion of all samples, into the final rule. For the purposes of calculatingcompliance, a system must count all repeat sample results in the same monthas the routine total coliform-positive sample which prompted those repeatsamples. States have the authority to increase the number of required samplesif they determine that it is necessary to assure that the water is safe.The November 3, 1987, notice also proposed that systems collect repeatsamples from the same sampling point as the original sample, except thatsome could be collected at the next service connection above and/or belowthe original sampling point. The intent was to allow systems to determinethe source and extent of contamination, i.e., whether the contaminationwas a distribution system problem or not. A few commenters suggested thatsystems be allowed to collect repeat samples at any nearby site ratherthan just the adjacent sites; they were concerned that sampling adjacentsites only might be difficult (e.g., if residents are not home or theyrefuse entry). EPA recognizes that systems may sometimes have difficultysampling at adjacent service connections. To account for this potentialproblem, the final rule allows systems to collect repeat samples up tofive service connections away, in either direction, from the contaminatedtap. EPA believes this broader repeat sampling range will still allow thesystem to determine the source and extent of contamination, while allowingit flexibilty to find sufficient sampling points. The final rule requiresthe system to collect at least one repeat sample from the same tap as theoriginal total coliform-positive sample, at least one repeat sample upstream,<T3>and </T3>at least one repeat sample downstream. This provision willprovide information to the system as to whether the contamination is adomestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem.Some commenters opposed the proposed requirement that systems collect allrepeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of a coliform-positiveresult. EPA continues to believe that the 24-hour limit for collectingrepeat samples is necessary to protect public health. Repeat samples arenecessary to determine the severity and extent of contamination. Becauseof the nature of the analytical methods for coliforms, the positive findingmay not be recognized for up to 96 hours after the sample is taken. Thus,time already is lost, so rapid collection of repeat samples is essential.The Agency does recognize, however, that some systems may have certainlogistical problems in obtaining repeat samples promptly that are outsidetheir control, e.g., a laboratory may not be available every day to shipempty sample bottles or receive water samples. To provide some allowancefor such situations, while still safeguarding public health, the finalrule allows the State to waive the 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis.The State must grant any such waiver before the 24-hour period has passed;it cannot excuse late sampling after the fact. In this case, the Statemust specify the time by which the system must collect these repeat samples.In such cases, the Agency encourages the State to require repeat samplingas soon as possible.A State cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on the basisof repeat sample results in systems consisting of a single service connection,since they cannot collect upstream and downstream samples and demonstratethe problem was not in the distribution system. Thus, the primary reasonfor requiring such a system to collect repeat samples is to determine theeffectiveness of any corrective actions. Since a system with a single serviceconnection cannot collect repeat samples at different locations as othersystems can, the final rule allows the State to authorize such systemsto collect the required set of repeat samples over four days, rather thanwithin 24 hours, after being notified of a total coliform-positive result.The final rule also provides the State discretion to allow such systemsto collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) (e.g., a single 400-ml repeatsample or two 200-ml repeat samples) in one or more sample containers ofany size, as long as the total volume collected is at least 400 ml (300ml for systems which collect more than one routine sample/month). In addition,under the final rule, if a total coliform-positive sample is at the endof the distribution system, or one away from the end of the distributionsystem, the State may waive the requirement to collect at least one repeatsample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site.As noted above, the final rule requires systems with more than one serviceconnection to collect the repeat samples within 24 hours of obtaining atotal coliform-positive result from an original sample. EPA is not allowingsuch systems to collect repeat samples over a period of days as a routinematter because these systems usually serve more people than a system withone service connection, and thus more people would be at risk if contaminationwere to be present in the distribution system; these larger systems needto evaluate and eliminate any contamination quickly before it causes waterborneillness in a large population. For the same reason EPA encourages Statesto require larger and more complex systems with single service connectionsto sample quickly whenever they detect a total coliform-positive sampleto ascertain the nature of a contamination problem and the effectivenessof any corrective action.Some systems may collect one or more routine samples from within five adjacentservice connections of a previously collected routine sample. If the previouslycollected routine sample(s) is later found to be total coliform-positive,then the system may count the subsequent routine sample as a repeat sample.(However, in such instances, a system may not count this sample(s) twicein compliance calculations, i.e., as both a routine sample and a repeatsample.) This provision will slightly reduce the cost burden to the system,since it can decrease the number of repeat samples a system needs to collectafter it learns of a total coliform-positive result. Some commenters opposed the proposal to require systems to collect andanalyze another set of repeat samples if any repeat sample were total coliform-positive.The Agency, however, believes that, whenever a repeat sample is total coliform-positive,sampling should continue in order to clarify the extent of the contamination,and to assure that the problem is corrected; total coliform-positive repeatsamples are of no less concern than total coliform-positive routine samples.Based on this conclusion, EPA has adopted the proposed provision in thefinal rule. Thus, whenever a system has one or more total coliform-positiverepeat samples (and neither the original total coliform-positive samplenor the total coliform-positive repeat sample(s) is invalidated), the systemmust collect another set of repeat samples (either three or four, as specifiedin the rule). The system must collect this additional set of repeat sampleswithin 24 hours of being notified of the total coliform-positive result(s),as before. This requirement should not be a burden to most systems, sincerepeat samples count toward the monthly monitoring requirement. Furthermore,smaller systems are not required to collect any additional sets of repeatsamples once they notify the State that they are in violation of the MCLfor total coliforms. Thus, for a system which collects fewer than 40 samples/month,a total coliform-positive repeat sample (which is not invalidated) constitutesan MCL violation, so no additional repeat samples are required that month(unless the State requires otherwise), once the State is notified of theviolation. d. <T3>Additional monitoring for unfiltered surface water systems. </T3>TheNovember 3, 1987, total coliform notice proposed to require each systemusing unfiltered surface water to collect one coliform sample near thefirst service connection within 24 hours after determining that its sourcewater turbidity exceeds 1 NTU. Under the proposal, this coliform samplewould count toward the total number required. EPA received very few commentson this issue. Thus, the Agency has incorporated this requirement intothe final rule, for the reasons given in the November 3, 1987, notice.This requirement also applies to unfiltered groundwater systems under thedirect influence of surface water. To improve clarity, EPA is specifyingthat systems collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the firsttime during a day that the turbidity exceeds 1 NTU. Systems need only collecta single coliform sample near the first service connection once/day, evenif the turbidity exceeds 1 NTU more than once/day. The Agency recognizes that some systems which collect a sample within 24hours after exceeding a turbidity level of 1 NTU may not be able to havethe samples analyzed within 30 hours of collection for logistical reasonsoutside their control (e.g., the laboratory is closed during a weekend).To accommodate such situations, the State may waive the requirement, ona case-by-case basis, for a system to collect the coliform sample whenthe turbidity exceeds 1 NTU. The rationale for allowing States to providethis waiver is that high turbidity events are often short-lived; if thesystem were to collect the coliform sample more than 24 hours after suchan event in order to ensure analysis within 30 hours of collection, itis unlikely that the sample would provide useful information about thedisinfection conditions during that event. Thus, EPA believes it more appropriateto allow the State to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, ratherthan to extend the 24-hour limit. EPA also has defined the term ``near the first service connection'' tomean one of the 20 percent of all service connections in the entire systemthat are nearest the water supply treatment facility, as measured by thewater transport time within the distribution system. This requirement isdiscussed more fully in the final rule promulgating the surface water treatmentrequirements, published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> e. <T3>Chlorine substitution policy. </T3>The interim coliform rule (40 CFR141.21(h)) allows systems to substitute the use of chlorine residual monitoringresults for up to 75 percent of the coliform samples required to be taken.In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA did not propose to include this ``chlorinesubstitution policy'' in the revised coliform regulations for the reasonsgiven in that notice. For the same reasons, this final rule does not includea chlorine substitution policy. However, as noted in the proposal, EPAwill consider incorporating this concept in the upcoming groundwater disinfectionrule which EPA must promulgate under section 1412(b)(8) of SDWA. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Fecal Coliform and E. coli Requirements </ITAG>As explained in the November 3, 1987, notice, the presence of fecal coliformsin drinking water is strong evidence of recent sewage contamination. Thepresence of fecal coliforms indicates that an urgent public health problemprobably exists, since human pathogens often co-exist with fecal coliforms.Therefore, EPA proposed to require that public water systems analyze eachtotal coliform-positive sample (whether an original or repeat sample) todetermine if it contains fecal coliforms. Under the proposal, if fecalcoliforms were detected, the system would be in violation of the monthlyMCL for total coliforms and would be required to notify the State within48 hours of the violation. The violation would be considered ``acute,''requiring immediate public notification (i.e., within 72 hours) via electronicmedia, as well as written follow-up notification, in the case of a communitywater system (a non-community water system may choose an alternative methodof immediate notification). In the May 6, 1988, notice, EPA presented an alternative option which wouldrequire the system to report a fecal coliform-positive result to the Stateimmediately instead of within 48 hours, and collect repeat samples. Then,if the system detected fecal coliforms in any repeat sample taken at thesame location or an immediately adjacent service connection, the systemwould be in violation of the monthly MCL for total coliforms. Many commenters opposed the classification of a single fecal coliform-positivesample as an acute violation, thus requiring immediate public notification.They stated that some fecal coliform-positive samples are due to ``false-positives''(i.e., bacteria other than <T3>E. coli</T3>) and that some fecal coliform-positive samples might reflecta domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem, rather thana problem in the distribution system. Commenters also stated that it iscommon for systems which collect many samples to detect a fecal coliform-positivesample occasionally without any known adverse health effect, and that notifyingthe public in every such case might eventually cause indifference to publicnotices. In fact, several large, well-operated community water supplieshave submitted data to EPA showing that they occasionally detect a fecalcoliform-positive sample in the distribution system, among the hundredsor thousands of samples collected annually. Under these circumstances, EPA agrees that it would be unnecessarily burdensometo require systems to provide immediate public notification each time afecal coliform-positive result occurs, especially since EPA is also requiringsystems to notify the State of any fecal coliform-positive result, so theState can require any measures necessary in appropriate circumstances.Nevertheless, the Agency still believes that any total coliform-positivesample which is not invalidated and which contains fecal coliforms verylikely represents a serious health risk to the community. Therefore, underthe final rule, a system must analyze each total coliform-positive sampleto determine if it contains fecal coliforms. A system is in violation ofthe MCL for total coliforms whenever (1) any repeat sample is fecal coliform-positive,or (2) a fecal coliform-positive original sample is followed by a totalcoliform-positive repeat sample. This violation is ``acute,'' as definedin 40 CFR 141.32(a)(1)(iii) (the public notification requirements) andas such, requires public notification by electronic media within 72 hoursand subsequent written notification in the case of a community water system,as specified in 40 CFR 141.32 (a non-community system may choose an alternativemethod of immediate notification but the time limit is still 72 hours).EPA believes that this approach strikes a balance among the desirabilityof confirming analyses before acting on the results, the serious natureof fecal coliform-positive contamination, and the decreasing effectivenessof frequent, urgent notifications of occasional localized distributionsystem problems. The final rule provides the State with discretion to allow a public watersystem, on a case-by-case basis, to assume that a total coliform-positivesample is fecal coliform-positive without requiring it to be actually testedfor fecal coliforms. This provision might reduce the cost of analysis.The Agency, however, does not believe that States should implement thiswaiver provision broadly, since States that did so would be unable to distinguish,and thus focus their limited resources on, systems which pose a major acuterisk to the public. A State should limit implementation of this provisionto special circumstances, e.g., to water systems which are known to bevulnerable to fecal contamination. If a system assumes that a total coliform-positivesample is also fecal coliform-positive, the system must comply with allrequirements in the rule concerning fecal coliforms. If any repeat sampleis total coliform-positive, then the system is in violation of the MCLfor total coliforms and must notify the public of an acute risk to health.On a related issue, in the November 3, 1987, and May 6, 1988, notices,EPA requested public comment on whether it would be appropriate to allowan analysis for the presence of <T3>E. coli </T3>in lieu of fecal coliforms whenever the system has a totalcoliform-positive sample. The vast majority of commenters who addressedthis issue favored <T3>E. coli </T3>testing as an alternative to fecal coliform testing. One reason commenters support <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli </T3>testing in lieu of fecal coliform testing is that the fecalcoliform test may produce a fecal coliform-positive result for <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3>, some thermotolerant strains of <T3>Klebsiella</T3>, and several thermotolerant strains in other genera.Many commenters pointed out that only <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> is a contaminant of concern, not the other thermotolerantstrains. In addition, as explained in the November 3, 1987, notice, severalbathing beach studies have found that densities of <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> were more closely related to gastroenteritis than were densitiesof fecal coliforms. Yet fecal coliform testing is very simple and inexpensive,and systems and laboratories are familiar with this test and thus may preferto use it. In addition, any false-positive error is on the side of safety.For these reasons, the final rule allows the system to test for either<T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> or fecal coliforms whenever the system finds a total coliform-positivesample.In the November 3, 1988, notice, EPA proposed to require a system to notifythe State of a fecal coliform-positive sample within 48 hours. Some commentersindicated that this might be difficult to do on weekends, when State officesare closed. The Agency agrees. Therefore, under the final rule, systemsmust notify the State of a fecal coliform- or <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3>-positive sample by the end of the same business day thatthe system learns of it, or no later than the end of the next businessday if the coliform-positive result becomes known after the close of Statebusiness for the day. However, EPA strongly encourages States to establish(or use existing) round-the-clock emergency response programs to obtainimmediate reports of, and respond to, fecal coliform- and <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3>-positive results.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Heterotrophic Bacteria Interference</ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed that if a laboratory observedevidence of interference with the total coliform analysis caused by highlevels of heterotrophic bacteria, as defined in that notice, the publicwater system would be required to: (1) Declare the sample total coliform-positiveand collect the required number of repeat samples, or (2) invalidate thesample, collect another sample from the same location, and have the sampleanalyzed within eight hours (or 30 hours, if the sample was refrigerated)for both the presence or absence of total coliforms and the density ofheterotrophic bacteria. Under the second option, if the sample containedgreater than 500 colonies/ml, as measured by the heterotrophic plate countanalytical method, then the sample would be counted as a total coliform-positivesample, even if total coliforms were not detected.EPA received numerous comments on this proposed requirement. A number ofcommenters indicated that many systems would have difficulty meeting theeight-hour limit between sample collection and analysis. Several suggestedthat EPA should simply require a system to collect another coliform samplewhen the laboratory indicates there may have been interference with thefirst coliform analysis, and not require the system to enumerate heterotrophicbacteria, nor count a high level of heterotrophic bacteria as a total coliform-positivesample.Based on the public comments, EPA has concluded that a sizable number ofsmall systems would find it very difficult to meet the eight-hour limitbetween sample collection and analysis, and that refrigeration of thesesamples would be very costly and impractical for these systems. The Agencybelieves that, as a result, a large number of systems would end up declaringthe sample as total coliform-positive when there was not necessarily aheterotrophic bacteria problem or total coliforms in the sample. This wasnot EPA's intent. The Agency's primary intent was to prevent a system fromusing total coliform-negative results in compliance calculations when thoseresults were derived from a culture showing evidence of interference fromhigh levels of heterotrophic bacteria, and thus were potentially unreliable.In response, the final rule does not require that public water systemstest for levels of heterotrophic bacteria when there are indications ofinterference with total coliform measurements, nor do samples with highlevels of heterotrophic bacteria count as total coliform-positive samples.Instead, under the final rule, the system must invalidate any sample whichhas visual evidence of interference (<T3>unless </T3>total coliforms are detected), collect another sample fromthe same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notifiedof the interference problem, and have it analyzed for total coliforms.In testing these replacement samples, the system should minimize sampletransit time and transit temperature, and the laboratory should considerusing an analytical method which is less vulnerable to interference byhigh levels of heterotrophic bacteria (e.g., the Minimal Medium ONPG-MUGtest, described below). The results of the second sample must be includedin compliance calculations, unless the laboratory reports that interferencehas again occurred, in which case the sample is invalid. The system mustcontinue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples re-analyzed,as described above, until it obtains a valid result.EPA believes that this requirement will help ensure that coliforms in acontaminated system will eventually be detected, and thereby protect thepopulation served, without imposing a severe burden on small systems.D. Analytical Methodology <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Analytical Methods for Total Coliforms </ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed that analysis for total coliformsbe conducted using either the Membrane Filter (MF) Technique, the 10-tubeMultiple Tube Fermentation (MTF) Technique, or the Presence-Absence (P-A)Coliform Test. EPA also proposed that a standard volume of 100 ml be analyzed,regardless of the methodology employed. Only the presence or absence ofcoliforms in a sample would be reported. In the May 6, 1988 notice, EPAalso proposed a fourth analytical method for monitoring the presence orabsence of total coliforms, the Colilert System, referred to in this ruleby the more generic name, the Minimal Medium ONPG-MUG or MMO-MUG, test.EPA received a number of comments on the proposed analytical methodologies.Most commenters supported the proposed methodologies and agreed that theuse of a standard volume was appropriate. Some commenters, however, wereopposed to the elimination of the 5-tube MTF Technique, using a sample50 ml (a currently EPA-approved method). For the reasons stated in theNovember 3, 1987, notice, EPA is promulgating the 10-tube test, ratherthan the 5-tube test. However, under this final rule, it is permissibleto run the 10-tube MTF Technique using only five tubes if the laboratoryuses larger tubes which collectively analyze a 100-ml water sample. Likewise,the laboratory may use a single bottle containing the MTF medium if itis of sufficient volume to determine the presence or absence of coliformsin a 100-ml water sample. If a system with a single service connection provides a laboratory witha large volume repeat sample(s), i.e., 200 ml or greater, the laboratorymust analyze separate 100-ml portions, as required by the analytical methods.EPA is not allowing analysis of larger sample volumes because of the likelihoodof interference with the analytical methodology by high densities of heterotrophicbacteria and turbidity. Based on ample validity data, described in the record for this rule, whichsupport the use of the proposed methodologies, EPA is promulgating allfour of the proposed methods for use in monitoring the presence or absenceof coliforms in a 100-ml sample of water. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Analytical Methods for Fecal Coliforms and E. coli </ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed to require the use of ECmedium for determining the presence of fecal coliforms in a total coliform-positiveculture. The ingredients and preparation of this medium are described inStandard Methods (APHA, 1985). The Agency also proposed a procedure fortransferring growth from a total coliform-positive culture to EC medium.There were no significant public comments on this issue; EPA has decidedto promulgate these provisions as proposed. As explained above, EPA has decided to allow systems to test for <T3>E. coli </T3>in lieu of fecal coliforms. The Agency will propose analyticalmethods for <T3>E. coli </T3>in a subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, and promulgate those methods before theeffective date of this rule. E. Laboratory Certification Currently, analysis of drinking water samples to determine compliance withthe MCLs for coliforms must be analyzed by a laboratory approved by theEPA or a State, as specified by 40 CFR 142.10(b)(4) and 141.28. In theNovember 3, 1987, notice, EPA solicited comment on, but did not propose,field inoculation and analysis as an alternate approach to requiring theuse of certified laboratories for total coliform analysis. Under this approach,a system operator could either send the water sample to a certified laboratoryor conduct the analysis on-site by adding a 100-ml water sample to a bottlecontaining commercially pre-sterilized medium, incubating the sample, andanalyzing and recording the results. Almost all commenters who addressed this issue opposed the field inoculationand analysis option for sample analysis. Commenters were concerned aboutthe significantly greater potential for unreliable results and abuse comparedto analysis performed in a certified laboratory, and lack of operator trainingin analytical methodology. EPA shares these concerns. For this reason,this final rule requires that systems use laboratories which are certifiedby EPA or a State to analyze compliance samples for total coliforms, fecalcoliforms, and <T3>E. coli. </T3>This requirement, however, does not preclude systemsfrom inoculating samples in the field and submitting these inoculated samplesto a certified laboratory for incubation and analysis, whenever the analyticalmethods approved by EPA is 40 CFR 141.21a(f)(2) of the rule permit it.The Agency is in the process of developing regulations under 40 CFR Parts141 and 142 to improve State laboratory certification programs and prescribeother quality assurance measures for compliance samples and data management;the issue of self-analysis of compliance samples for total coliforms andother microbial and chemical contaminants will be evaluated as part ofthis process. This rule has no specific laboratory certification criteria. EPA will allowany laboratory already certified by the Agency to perform total coliformanalysis under the current rule to perform analysis for total coliforms,fecal coliforms, and <T3>E. coli </T3>under this rule until the Agency has established laboratorycertification criteria for use with this rule, and has certified it toanalyze for total coliforms and fecal coliforms and/or <T3>E. coli </T3>under those criteria. The Agency recommends that Statesuse the same approach for State-certified laboratories. EPA believes thisapproach is reasonable, since the analytical methods being promulgatedfor the detection of total coliforms and fecal coliforms are similar tocurrent methods. Furthermore, EPA expects that methods which will be promulgatedfor <T3>E. coli </T3>will be similar to current methods. Consequently, laboratoriescurrently certified for the enumeration of total coliforms should be capableof making all analytical measurements required in this rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Variances and Exemptions </ITAG>In the November 3, 1988, notice, EPA proposed that neither variances norexemptions to the coliform rule be permitted. Few commenters addressed this issue. Some agreed that variances and exemptionsshould not be allowed. Others stated that States should be allowed to issuevariances or exemptions to small systems when: (1) The system has had along record of compliance before development of the problem; (2) the systemis in a sparsely populated area; and (3) the system is in an area wherethe geological formation is known to produce safe water.As EPA explained in the November 3, 1978, notice, coliforms are the primaryindicator of the microbiological quality of water. To the extent a varianceor exemption would permit the continued presence of coliforms, the potentialfor pathogens to be present also would remain. EPA believes that waterwhich exceeds the MCL for total coliforms generally poses an unreasonablerisk to health. Therefore, EPA believes States would be unable to makethe required determination that no unreasonable risk to health (URTH) wouldresult from a variance or exemption, since a variance or exemption wouldpermit the continued presence of total coliforms in drinking water abovethe MCL. In addition, in judging whether variances or exemptions are appropriate,it is important to recognize that the final coliform rule already providessome latitude by allowing coliforms to be present in a few, i.e., fivepercent, of the samples taken for larger systems and one sample per monthfor systems collecting fewer than 40 samples per month. Accordingly, EPAhas concluded that variances and exemptions should not be allowed. However,the Agency is aware of systems where persistent coliforms are present dueto distribution system problems, but apparently are not associated withfecal or pathogenic contamination or with waterborne disease. EPA intendsto study these cases to determine whether generic URTH criteria can bedeveloped that could be used as the basis for permitting variances andexemptions under limited circumstances in the future. Section 141.4 is being revised to reflect the Agency's conclusion thatno variances or exemptions to the MCL for total coliforms are allowed.This revision to andSection; 141.4 also prohibits variances from the treatmenttechnique requirements of the surface water treatment requirements in Part141, Subpart H, promulgated elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The rationale for not allowing variances fromthe treatment technique requirements is set out in that notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Best Available Technologies (BATs) for Total Coliforms </ITAG>In the November 3, 1987, notice EPA proposed the following BATs for totalcoliforms: protection of wells from contamination by coliforms by appropriateplacement and construction; maintenance of a disinfectant residual of atleast 0.2 mg/l throughout the distribution system; proper maintenance ofthe distribution system including appropriate pipe replacement and repairprocedures, main flushing programs, proper operation andmaintenance ofstorage tanks and reservoirs, and continual maintenance of positive waterpressure in all parts of the distribution system; and filtration and/ordisinfection of surface water, as defined in 40 CFR Part 141, Subpart H(promulgated elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), or disinfection of ground water using strongoxidants such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone.Since there is a very long history of success of these methods for significantlyreducing coliform levels (especially when used together, where appropriate),no more effective technologies were identified by commenters, and theyare ``available'' (taking cost into consideration). EPA is promulgatingthe proposed BATs in the final coliform rule, without changes. However,the Agency, while continuing to recommend that systems maintain a disinfectantresidual, is not specifying a particular concentration value for that residual,since optimum values vary according to the disinfectant used, as well asother factors. Appropriate disinfectant residual concentrations for surfacewater systems are described in the surface water treatment requirements(published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>) and also will be examined in the developmentof the forthcoming groundwater disinfection rule. An additional means for achieving compliance with the MCL for total coliformsincludes the development and implementation of an EPA-approved State WellheadProtection Program under section 1428 of the Act. This program, which hasbeen included as BAT in the final rule, is described in section IX below.The technologies listed above for removal of microbial contamination arediscussed extensively in <T3>Technologies and Costs for the Treatment of Microbial Contaminantsin Potable Water Supplies </T3>(USEPA, 1988). Filtration, disinfection,and maintenance of the distribution system also will be discussed in EPA'sforthcoming <T3>Guidance Manual for Compliance with the Filtration and DisinfectionRequirements for Public Water Systems Using Surface Water Sources. </T3>Themethods listed above represent the technology, treatment technique, andother means which EPA finds to be feasible for purposes of meeting theMCL for total coliforms, in accordance with section 1412(b)(6) of SDWA,but this regulation does not require the use of the above methods; if treatmentis necessary, systems are free to meet the requirements of this regulationusing the methods of their choice (provided they are acceptable to theState.) <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Public Notification </ITAG>A. Reporting and Recordkeeping In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed to require that a publicwater system report a violation of the total coliform MCL or coliform monitoringrequirement (e.g., a failure to monitor) to the State within 48 hours.EPA also proposed to require a system that detected fecal coliforms inany sample (which was considered an MCL violation under the proposal) toreport this violation to the State within 48 hours of its discovery. TheAgency also proposed that systems report violations of the long-term coliformMCL to the State. EPA received very few comments on this proposed reporting requirement.Some commenters indicated that the 48-hour time limit would sometimes bedifficult to meet on weekends, when State employees are not at work. EPAagrees, and instead is requiring that systems notify the State of any MCLviolation not later than the end of the next business day after the systemhas been notified of the analytical result which results in the violation.EPA is also requiring that a system notify the State of any monitoringviolation, including a failure to complete a sanitary survey within thespecified time frame, within ten days after the system learns of the violation.To implement this reporting requirement, EPA is revising andSection;141.31(b),which currently requires systems to report a violation of a national primarydrinking water regulation to the State within 48 hours. The Agency is not promulgating the proposed reporting requirements fora violation of the long-term MCL, since the proposed long-term MCL is notincluded in this final rule. Systems must continue to comply with 40 CFR 141.33, which specifies recordkeepingrequirements. B. Public Notification Language: Total Coliforms The revised public notification regulations at 40 CFR 141.32 require thatnotices of an MCL violation describe any adverse health effects. The descriptionmust include, at a minimum, language specified by EPA for that contaminant.In the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed language for public noticesfor a violation of either the monthly or long-term MCL for total coliforms.Several commenters opposed the proposed language. Some stated that it istoo extreme and could cause undue alarm and undermine customer confidencein the water supply. Others claimed that the proposed wording implies thatthe presence of any total coliforms found in the drinking water will automaticallyproduce disease, and were concerned that all diarrhea, nausea, headaches,etc. will be attributed to drinking water. Some commenters suggested specificchanges in the wording of the public notice (primarily the deletion ofreferences to specific diseases and disease symptoms). EPA appreciates the concern that many individuals might blame the watersystem whenever they experience the disease symptoms listed in the publicnotice. Nevertheless, the Act requires public notices to identify whatadverse health effects may result when a system exceeds the MCL, and EPAbelieves customers should be fully informed of possible consequences ofa violation. Thus, the mandatory language promulgated today retains thelist of potential symptoms. To address the concerns expressed by commenters,however, the Agency has added a statement in the public notice languagethat notes that factors other than drinking water may also cause the symptomsnoted. The Agency believes such a statement is warranted in the publicnotice for total coliforms even though it was not included in the publicnotice language promulgated for volatile organic chemicals and fluoride.The difference is that the chronic effects these other contaminants cancause, such as cancer, occur much less frequently than the acute effectsassociated with coliform contamination such as headaches and diarrhea;most people experience these symptoms at least several times per year.Thus, a public notice for total coliforms without the qualifying languagemay lead many individuals to blame the water system as the cause of theirillness when this may not be appropriate. With the addition of this explanation,EPA does not believe that the mandatory language is too extreme. In response to the public comments, EPA has revised the public notice toread as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinkingwater standards and has determined that the presence of total coliformsis a possible health concern. Total coliforms are common in the environmentand are generally not harmful themselves. The presence of these bacteriain drinking water, however, generally is a result of a problem with watertreatment or the pipes which distribute the water, and indicates that thewater may be contaminated with organisms that can cause disease. Diseasesymptoms may include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, and possibly jaundice, andany associated headaches and fatigue. These sysptoms, however, are notjust associated with disease-causing organisms in drinking water, but alsomay be caused by a number of factors other than your drinking water. EPAhas set an enforceable drinking water standard for total coliforms to reducethe risk of these adverse health effects. Under this standard, no morethan 5.0 percent of the samples collected during a month can contain thesebacteria, except that systems collecting fewer than 40 samples/month thathave one total coliform-positive sample per month are not violating thestandard. Drinking water which meets this standard is usually not associatedwith a health risk from disease-causing bacteria and should be consideredsafe.</ITAG>C. Public Notification Language: Fecal Coliforms/E. coliIn the November 3, 1987, and May 6, 1988, notices, EPA explained that itbelieves that the presence of fecal coliforms or <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> in treated water is cause for grave concern and probablyposes an acute risk to human health because when fecal coliforms or <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> are detected, if is likely that human pathogens are present.For this reason, EPA believes that more urgent public notice language isneeded when fecal coliforms or <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> are detected, compared to when total coliforms are detected.Thus, in the November 3, 1987, notice, EPA proposed separate mandatoryhealth effects language for public notices when fecal coliforms are detected.The majority of individuals who commented on the proposed language forthe two public notices did not distinguish between them. In these cases,EPA assumed that the commenters were referring to both notices. Regardingthe comments expressing concern that all diarrhea, nausea, headaches, etc.,will be attributed to drinking water, the Agency's position for the fecalcoiform/<T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> notice is the same as for the total coliform notice, forthe same reasons described above. In addition, some commenters thoughterroneously that EPA had proposed to require systems to issue a boil waternotice as part of the public notice whenever they were notified that asample contained fecal coliforms; the Agency has clarified this point ofconfusion by omitting any reference to boiling the water in the mandatorylanguage. Based on its evaluation of the comments, EPA has revised themandatory health effects language for fecal coliforms/<T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinkingwater standards and has determined that the presence of fecal coliformsor <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> is a serious health concern. Fecal coliforms and <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> are generally not harmful themselves, but their presencein drinking water is serious because they usually are associated with sewageor animal wastes. The presence of these bacteria in drinking water is generallya result of a problem with water treatment or the pipes which distributethe water, and indicates that the water may be contaminated with organismsthat can cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps,nausea, and possibly jaundice, and associated headaches and fatigue. Thesesymptoms, however, are not just associated with disease-causing organismsin drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factors otherthan your drinking water. EPA has set an enforceable drinking water standardfor fecal coliforms and <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects. Underthis standard all drinking water samples must be free of these bacteria.Drinking water which meets this standard is associated with little or noneof this risk and should be considered safe. State and local health authoritiesrecommend that consumers take the following precautions: [To be insertedby the public water systems, according to instrucitons from State or localauthorities].</ITAG>EPA is requiring the water system to include information at the end ofthe mandatory public notice on what precautions the public should take.The Agency believes that it is important to provide all of the system'sconsumers with specific information on the problem and suggestions fordealing with it; consumers should not have to take additional steps toobtain this information elsewhere.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Costs and Benefits of Complying With the NPDWR for Total Coliforms</ITAG>A. CostsThe estimated cost of this rule consists of costs for routine and repeatmonitoring and periodic sanitary surveys. Many commenters though that remedialaction costs should be included as well. For accounting purposes, EPA isallocating the cost of remedial actions to the surface water treatmentrequirements, published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, or the forthcoming groundwater disinfectionrule, rather than the total coliform rule, because the interrelationshipsbetween them make it impossible to clearly distinguish which costs shouldbe attributed to each rule. Occasionally, as a result of meeting the provisionsof the total coliform rule, a system may discover a contamination problemnot addressed by the surface water treatment requirements and groundwaterdisinfection rule (e.g., cross-connections, biofilm problems in the presenceof disinfectants). EPA believes that the cost of remedial action in thesecause is negligible. Moreover, in these cases, while State or local requirementsmay dictate remedial action, this regulation does not. For these reasons,EPA has not attributed these remedial costs to this final rule.Assuming that a commercial laboratory is used for all required analyses,EPA has estimated the increment of additional monitoring for all systemsto cost from $20.5 to $31.5 million/year. This estimate is based on anaverage collection cost of $4/sample for large systems, and $10.50/samplefor small systems. For small systems, depending on whether they are locatedin rural areas or near large metropolitan areas, collection costs are estimatedto range from $4/sample to $17/sample. For the purposes of economic analysis,sample analysis costs for total coliforms are estimated at $12/sample.Fecal coliform or <T3>E</T3>. <T3>coli</T3> testing of total coliform-positive cultures is estimatedto cost an additional $12/sample. This cost information is found in theEconomic Impact Analysis (EIA) for this rule (USEPA, 1989).Sanitary surveys for systems collecting fewer than five samples/month mustbe performed at five-year intervals (except for systems using protectedand disinfected ground water for which the interval is ten years). EPAestimates the total cost of these surveys, annualized over 20 years andassuming a three percent interest rate, at $28 million per year. In sum,the incremental cost of this rule over the interim rule is estimated torange from $64 to $76 million per year, including an incremental cost of$16 million which will be incurred by the States for implementing thisrevised rule. Systems already are also incurring costs to comply with theMCLs for total coliforms under the interim rule, which are estimated tobe $67 million per year. When added to the incremental costs associatedwith today's rule, the total cost for systems to comply with the revisedcoliform requirements is estimated to range from $131 to $142 million peryear (Table 5). These estimates are more fully discussed in the EIA (USEPA,1989). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s25,6,6,6,6 </C><T4>Table </T4>5_<T4>National Costs of the Total Coliform Rule </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">(In millions of dollars/year) </ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Total </H1><H2>Lower bound </H2><H2>Upper bound </H2><H1>Incremental increase over interim requirements </H1><H2>Lower bound </H2><H2>Upper bound</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Routine monitoring <D>67 </D><D>67 </D><D>1.5 </D><D>1.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sanitary surveys <D>28 </D><D>28 </D><D>28 </D><D>28 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Repeat monitoring <D>20 </D><D>31 </D><D>19 </D><D>30 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State program costs <D>\1\ 16 </D><D>\1\ 16 </D><D>16 </D><D>16</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>131 </D><D>142 </D><D>64 </D><D>76 </D><F>\1\ Baseline information is unknown.

Benefits The benefit of the coliform rule is the identification of public watersystems that are contaminated or vulnerable to contamination. The ruleidentifies such systems by requiring routine monitoring by all systems,requiring periodic sanitary surveys for small systems, requiring additionalmonitoring for systems which detect contamination, clarifying when a Statemay invalidate a total coliform-positive sample, requiring fecal coliformor <T3>E. coli </T3>testing on all total coliform-positive cultures, and requiringsystems to develop (subject to State review and revision) the sample sitingplan for each system. EPA believes that these elements of this revisedtotal coliform rule will identify a significant number of water systemswhich will need to take action to improve the microbial quality of theirwater and others where preventive action will avoid future problems. The remedial measures necessary to comply with the total coliform rulewill also fulfill some or all of the surface water treatment requirementsor the forthcoming groundwater disinfection requirements. As with costs,for accounting purposes, EPA is attributing all health benefits resultingfrom compliance with this rule to the surface water treatment requirementsand the disinfection rule for groundwater systems, rather than the totalcoliform rule, because the interrelationships among them make it impossibleto clearly distinguish which benefits are attributable to each rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. State Implementation of Total Coliform Requirements </ITAG>A. General Primacy Requirements Section 1413 of the SDWA establishes requirements a State must meet inorder to receive primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) for publicwater systems. These include: (1) Adopting drinking water regulations noless stringent than the NPDWRs in effect under sections 1412(a) and 1412(b);(2) adopting and implementing adequate procedures for enforcement; (3)keeping records and making such reports with respect to its activitiesas EPA may require by regulation; (4) issuing variances and exemptions(if allowed at all by the State) under conditions no less stringent thanallowed by sections 1415 and 1416; and (5) adopting and being able to implementan adequate plan for the provision of safe drinking water emergency situations.40 CFR Part 142 sets out the specific program implementation requirementsfor States to obtain primacy for the public water system supervision (PWSS)program as authorized under section 1413 of the SDWA. EPA first promulgatedthese regulations on January 20, 1976. Since 1976, however, much has happenedin the PWSS program, and portions of the implementation regulations at40 CFR Part 142 have become outdated. In response, on August 2, 1988, theAgency proposed revisions to 40 CFR Part 142, Subpart B which take intoaccount the program's evolution since 1976, as well as the new legislativemandates (53 FR 29194). The revised implementation regulations will bepromulgated shortly. These implementation regulations will specify procedures,timing, and other general section 1413 requirements a State must meet toretain primary enforcement responsibility, including the requirement thatprimary States adopt drinking water regulations that are no less stringentthan new or revised national primary drinking water regulations promulgatedunder SDWA section 1412. Since these general requirements will apply toStates adopting this revised coliform rule, today's amendment of 40 CFRPart 142 only addresses primacy criteria that are unique to the total coliformrule. For objective criteria in the NPDWRs, including the revised coliform rule,i.e., requirements that do not involve an exercise of discretion, States,as a condition of obtaining or maintaining (as appropriate) primacy, mustpromulgate regulations that incorporate requirements that are no less stringentthan the national regulations. For the discretionary criteria, i.e., thosewhich the State has discretion to choose how they will be implemented,the State, as part of its program revision, generally need only describethe practices or procedures it will use to implement those portions ofits program. Both types of criteria are described below. B. Special Primacy Requirements As described above, an application for approval of a State program revisionmust describe the practices or procedures that the State will use to implementprovisions of the total coliform regulations that provide State flexibilitywith respect to how the objectives of the regulation are to be achieved,e.g., sample invalidation procedures. These optional discretionary elementsare listed in andSection; 142.16(c)(12). With the exception of the requirementsof 40 CFR 142.16(c)(1) (the sample siting plan approval procedure, whichis a mandatory element of a program revision), however, a State need onlysubmit the practices or procedures associated with implementing the elementsit intends to use. Thus, for a particular element listed, if the Statedoes not plan to exercise the discretion provided in the total coliformrule, the program revision need not address this element. Where the State is only required to describe the practices or proceduresit will use in exercising the discretion provided in the total coliformregulation, EPA review of that portion of the State program revision willgenerally be limited. It will consider whether the State practices or proceduresare clear and unambiguous, and whether they can be reasonably expectedto accomplish the objectives of the regulations. C. State Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Today's notice amends 40 CFR Part 142 to add requirements for States withprimary enforcement responsibility to retain records and report informationto EPA to ensure adequate oversight of the States' activities to implementthe revised total coliform regulations. No previously required reportingrequirements are deleted. States must: (1) Retain records of determinations made on a system-by-system or case-by-casebasis where the State has exercised its discretionary authority under theprovisions of andSection;142.16(c). The list of records of determinationswhich must be kept is contained in andSection;142.14(a)(5). Some of thesedecisions are only required to be put in writing and placed in the affectedsystem's file (e.g., waiving the 24-hour limit for collecting total coliformrepeat samples under certain specified conditions). Other decisions requirethat the system be notified in writing (e.g., reduced routine total coliformmonitoring for a public water system) in addition to a record of determinationbeing placed in the system's file. The requirement to have a record ofdecision in writing is necessary to determine compliance. Without thisrecord, a file review might show a system to be out of compliance whenin fact the State had used its discretionary authority to modify the requirementsthat the system had to meet. (2) Submit a report by January 1 of each year which consists of a listof public water systems which the State has determined are allowed to monitorless frequently than once per month for community water systems or lessfrequently than once per quarter for non-community water systems in accordancewith andSection;141.21a(a). The list must include effective dates for systemswhich did not have such a determination in place for the entire precedingfederal fiscal year. D. State Wellhead Protection Program Section 1428 of the SDWA contains requirements for the development andimplementation of State Wellhead Protection (WHP) Programs to protect wellsand wellfields which are used, or may be used, to provide source waterto public water systems. Under section 1428, each State must adopt andsubmit to EPA for approval a WHP Program that, at a minimum: (1) Specifies the duties of State agencies, local governments, and publicwater systems in the development and implementation of the WHP Program;(2) For each wellhead, determines the wellhead protection area (WHPA),as defined in section 1428(e) of SDWA, based on all reasonably availablehydrogeologic information on ground-water flow, recharge, and dischargeand other information the State deems necessary to adequately determinethe WHPA; (3) Identifies within each WHPA all potential human sources of contaminantswhich may have any adverse health effect; (4) Describes provisions for technical assistance, financial assistance,implementation of control measures, and education, training, and demonstrationprojects to protect the water supply within WHPAs from such contaminants;(5) Includes contingency plans for the location and provision of alternatedrinking water supplies for each public water system in the event of wellor wellfield contamination by such contaminants; (6) Requires that State and local governments and public water systemsconsider all potential sources of human contamination within the expectedwellhead area of a new water well which serves a public water system; and(7) Requires public participation in developing the WHP Program. SDWA required all States to submit a WHP program to EPA by June 19, 1989,for EPA review and approval. EPA has prepared the following technical guidancedocuments to assist States in developing WHP programs: ``Guidance for Applicantsfor State Wellhead Protection Program Assistance Funds under the Safe DrinkingWater Act'' (Office of Ground-Water Protection, 1987) and ``Guidelinesfor Delineation of Wellhead Protection Areas'' (Office of Ground-WaterProtection, 1987). States may wish to use the WHP Program to help assessthe vulnerability of a ground-water system to microbial and chemical contamination;such information would be useful to the State in determining the frequencywith which a system must sample and conduct sanitary surveys under thisrevised coliform rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Other Statutory and Executive Order Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirement.This action does not constitute a ``major'' regulatory action because itwill have a financial impact on the regulated community of under $100 millionper year. Therefore, EPA prepared an Economic Impact Analysis (USEPA, 1989)(rather than an RIA) during regulation development and submitted it tothe Office of Management and Budget for review. Results of the analysisare presented above in section VIII.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act requires EPA to explicitly consider theeffect of proposed regulations on small entities. If there is a significanteffect on a substantial number of small systems, means should be soughtto minimize the effects.The Small Business Administration defines a ``small water utility'' asone which serves fewer than 50,000 people. All systems in this size categorywill be subject to this final total coliform rule, but EPA expects theaverage incremental cost increase for such systems due to the new requirementsof this rule, compared to the total cost of producing water, to be quitesmall, about 0.6-0.7 percent. Consequently, the rule is not expected tohave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small systemswithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although EPA anticipatesthat some small entities may have some financial difficulty in achievingcompliance with the rule, the Agency has adopted a number of measures,many in response to public comments, to mitigate this burden. As a result,this final rule is less burdensome on small systems than the proposed rulewould have been. These measures include retaining the current monitoringfrequency for small systems (the proposal would have increased it) andreducing the frequency of sanitary surveys (compared to the proposal).EPA believes that further measures to reduce cost could significantly jeopardizepublic health.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements contained in this rule have beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> The information collection requirements are not effectiveuntil OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The public reporting burden on public water systems for this collectionof information, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information, is estimated to average 0.4hour more per response than the interim total coliform rule.

The State must approve the reduced monitoring frequencyin writing.(3) The monitoring frequency for total coliforms for non-community watersystems is as follows:(i) A non-community water system using only ground water (except groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in andSection;141.2) and serving 1,000 persons or fewer must monitor each calendar quarterthat the system provides water to the public, except that the State mayreduce this monitoring frequency, in writing, if a sanitary survey showsthat the system is free of sanitary defects. Beginning June 29, 1994 theState cannot reduce the monitoring frequency for a non-community watersystem using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influenceof surface water, as defined in andSection; 141.2) and serving 1,000 personsor fewer to less than once/year.(ii) A non-community water system using only ground water (except groundwater under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in andSection;141.2)and serving more than 1,000 persons during any month must monitor at thesame frequency as a like-sized community water system, as specified inparagraph (a)(2) of this section, except the State may reduce this monitoringfrequency, in writing, for any month the system serves 1,000 persons orfewer. The State cannot reduce the monitoring frequency to less than once/year.For systems using ground water under the direct influence of surface water,paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section applies. (iii) A non-community water system using surface water, in total or inpart, must monitor at the same frequency as a like-sized community watersystem, as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, regardless ofthe number of persons it serves. (iv) A non-community water system using ground water under the direct influenceof surface water, as defined in 141.2, must monitor at the same frequencyas a like-sized community water system, as specified in paragraph (a)(2)of this section. The system must begin monitoring at this frequency beginningsix months after the State determines that the ground water is under thedirect influence of surface water. (4) The public water system must collect samples at regular time intervalsthroughout the month, except that a system which uses ground water (exceptground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined inandSection;141.2), and serves 4,900 persons or fewer, may collect all requiredsamples on a single day if they are taken from different sites. (5) A public water system that uses surface water or ground water underthe direct influence of surface water, as defined in andSection;141.2, anddoes not practice filtration in compliance with Subpart H must collectat least one sample near the first service connection each day the turbiditylevel of the source water, measured as specified in andSection;141.74(b)(2),exceeds 1 NTU. This sample must be analyzed for the presence of total coliforms.When one or more turbidity measurements in any day exceed 1 NTU, the systemmust collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first exceedance,unless the State determines that the system, for logistical reasons outsidethe system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours ofcollection. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be includedin determining compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in andSection;141.63.(6) Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfectionpractices are sufficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair,shall not be used to determine compliance with the MCL for total coliformsin andSection;141.63. Repeat samples taken pursuant to paragraph (b) of thissection are not considered special purpose samples, and must be used todetermine compliance with the MCL for total coliforms in andSection;141.63.(b) <T3>Repeat monitoring.</T3> (1) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive,the public water system must collect a set of repeat samples within 24hours of being notified of the positive result. A system which collectsmore than one routine sample/month must collect no fewer than three repeatsamples for each total coliform-positive sample found. A system which collectsone routine sample/month or fewer must collect no fewer than four repeatsamples for each total coliform-positive sample found. The State may extendthe 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis if the system has a logisticalproblem in collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyondits control. In the case of an extension, the State must specify how muchtime the system has to collect the repeat samples. (2) The system must collect at least one repeat sample from the samplingtap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken, and atleast one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections upstreamand at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connectionsdownstream of the original sampling site. If a total coliform-positivesample is at the end of the distribution system, or one away from the endof the distribution system, the State may waive the requirement to collectat least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original samplingsite. (3) The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day, exceptthat the State may allow a system with a single service connection to collectthe required set of repeat samples over a four-day period or to collecta larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or more sample containers of anysize, as long as the total volume collected is at least 400 ml (300 mlfor systems which collect more than one routine sample/month).(4) If one or more repeat samples in the set is total coliform-positive,the public water system must collect an additional set of repeat samplesin the manner specified in paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) of this section. The additionalsamples must be collected within 24 hours of being notified of the positiveresult, unless the State extends the limit as provided in paragraph (b)(1)of this section. The system must repeat this process until either totalcoliforms are not detected in one complete set of repeat samples or thesystem determines that the MCL for total coliforms in andSection; 141.63has been exceeded and notifies the State.(5) If a system collecting fewer than five routine samples/month has oneor more total coliform-positive samples and the State does not invalidatethe sample(s) under paragraph (c) of this section, it must collect at leastfive routine samples during the next month the system provides water tothe public, except that the State may waive this requirement if the conditionsof paragraph (b)(5) (i) or (ii) of this section are met. The State cannotwaive the requirement for a system to collect repeat samples in paragraphs(b)(1)-(4) of this section.(i) The State may waive the requirement to collect five routine samplesthe next month the system provides water to the public if the State, oran agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before the end ofthe next month the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitarysurvey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailedto allow the State to determine whether additional monitoring and/or anycorrective action is needed. The State cannot approve an employee of thesystem to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approvedby the State to perform sanitary surveys.(ii) The State may waive the requirement to collect five routine samplesthe next month the system provides water to the public if the State hasdetermined why the sample was total coliform-positive and establishes thatthe system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem beforethe end of the next month the system serves water to the public. In thiscase, the State must document this decision to waive the following month'sadditional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signedby the supervisor of the State official who recommends such a decision,and make this document available to the EPA and public. The written documentationmust describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sampleand what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.The State cannot waive the requirement to collect five routine samplesthe next month the system provides water to the public solely on the groundsthat all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. Under this paragraph,a system must still take at least one routine sample before the end ofthe next month it serves water to the public and use it to determine compliancewith the MCL for total coliforms in andSection; 141.63, unless the Statehas determined that the system has corrected the contamination problembefore the system took the set of repeat samples required in paragraphs(b)(1)-(4) of this section, and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative.(6) After a system collects a routine sample and before it learns the resultsof the analysis of that sample, if it collects another routine sample(s)from within five adjacent service connections of the initial sample, andthe initial sample, after analysis, is found to contain total coliforms,then the system may count the subsequent sample(s) as a repeat sample insteadof as a routine sample.(7) Results of all routine and repeat samples not invalidated by the Statemust be included in determining compliance with the MCL for total coliformsin andSection; 141.63.(c) <T3>Invalidation of total coliform samples.</T3> A total coliform-positivesample invalidated under this paragraph (c) does not count towards meetingthe minimum monitoring requirements of this section. (1) The State mayinvalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if the conditions of paragraph(c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are met.(i) The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused thetotal coliform-positive result.(ii) The State, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collectedas required by paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section, determinesthat the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or othernon-distribution system plumbing problem. The State cannot invalidate asample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat sample(s)collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sampleare also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected withinfive service connections of the original tap are total coliform-negative(e.g., a State cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on thebasis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform-negative,or if the public water system has only one service connection).(iii) The State has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform-positiveresult is due to a circumstance or condition which does not reflect waterquality in the distribution system. In this case, the system must stillcollect all repeat samples required under paragraphs (b) (1) through (4)of this section, and use them to determine compliance with the MCL fortotal coliforms in andSection; 141.63. To invalidate a total coliform-positivesample under this paragraph, the decision with the rationale for the decisionmust be documented in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisorof the State official who recommended the decision. The State must makethis document available to EPA and the public. The written documentationmust state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, andwhat action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem.The State may not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample solely onthe grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.(2) A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless totalcoliforms are detected) if the sample produces a turbid culture in theabsence of gas production using an analytical method where gas formationis examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique), producesa turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the Presence-Absence(P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent growth or produces coloniestoo numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter(e.g., Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory invalidates a samplebecause of such interference, the system must collect another sample fromthe same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notifiedof the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of totalcoliforms. The system must continue to re-sample within 24 hours and havethe samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The State may waivethe 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis.(d) <T3>Sanitary surveys. </T3>(1)(i) Public water systems which do not collectfive or more routine samples/month must undergo an initial sanitary surveyby June 29, 1994 for community public water systems and June 29, 1999 fornon-community water systems. Thereafter, systems must undergo another sanitarysurvey every five years, except that non-community water systems usingonly protected and disinfected ground water, as defined by the State, mustundergo subsequent sanitary surveys at least every ten years after theinitial sanitary survey. The State must review the results of each sanitarysurvey to determine whether the existing monitoring frequency is adequateand what additional measures, if any, the system needs to undertake toimprove drinking water quality. (ii) In conducting a sanitary survey of a system using ground water ina State having an EPA-approved wellhead protection program under section1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, information on sources of contaminationwithin the delineated wellhead protection area that was collected in thecourse of developing and implementing the program should be consideredinstead of collecting new information, if the information was collectedsince the last time the system was subject to a sanitary survey. (2) Sanitary surveys must be performed by the State or an agent approvedby the State. The system is responsible for ensuring the survey takes place.(e) <T3>Fecal coliforms/Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing. </T3>(1) If anyroutine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, the system must analyzethat total coliform-positive culture medium to determine if fecal coliformsare present, except that the system may test for <T3>E. coli </T3>in lieu of fecal coliforms. If fecal coliforms or <T3>E. coli </T3>are present, the system must notify the State by the endof the day when the system is notified of the test result, unless the systemis notified of the result after the State office is closed, in which casethe system must notify the State before the end of the next business day.(2) The State has the discretion to allow a public water system, on a case-by-casebasis, to forgo fecal coliform or <T3>E. coli</T3> testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that systemassumes that the total coliform-positive sample is fecal coliform-positiveof <T3>E. coli</T3>-positive. Accordingly, the system must notify the Stateas specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the provisions ofandSection; 141.63(b) apply. (f) <T3>Analytical methodology. </T3>(1) The standard sample volume requiredfor total coliform analysis, regardless of analytical method used, is 100ml. (2) Public water systems need only determine the presence or absence oftotal coliforms; a determination of total coliform density is not required.(3) Public water systems must conduct total coliform analyses in accordancewith one of the following analytical methods: (i) Multiple-Tube Fermentation (MTF) Technique, as set forth in <T3>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, </T3>1985,American Public Health Association <T3>et al., </T3>16th edition, Method 908, 908A, and 908B_pp. 870-878,except that 10 fermentation tubes must be used; or <T3>Microbiological Methods for Monitoring the Environment, Water and Wastes,</T3>U.S. EPA, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati,Ohio 45268 (EPA-600/8-78-017, December 1978, available from ORD Publications,CERI, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268), Part III, Section B.4.1-4.6.4,pp. 114-118 (Most Probable Number Method), except that 10 fermentationtubes must be used; or (ii) Membrance Filter (MF) Technique, as set forth in <T3>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, </T3>1985,American Public Health Association <T3>et al., </T3>16th edition, Method 909, 909A and 909B_pp. 886-896; or<T3>Microbiological Methods for Monitoring the Environment, Water and Wastes,</T3>U.S. EPA, Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati,Ohio 45268 (EPA-600/8-78-017, December 1978, available from ORD Publications,CERI, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268), Part III, Section B.2.1-2.6, pp.108-112; or (iii) Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, as set forth in <T3>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, </T3>1985,American Public Health Association <T3>et al., </T3>16th edition, Method 908E_pp. 882-886; or (iv) Minimal Medium ONPG-MUG (MMO-MUG) Test, as set forth in the article``National Field Evaluation of a Defined Substrate Method for the SimultaneousDetection of Total Coliforms and <T3>Escherichia coli </T3>from Drinking Water: Comparison with Presence-AbsenceTechniques'' (Edberg et al.), Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Volume55, pp. 1003-1008, April 1989. (Note: The MMO-MUG Test is sometimes referredto as the Autoanalysis Colilert System.) (4) In lieu of the 10-tube MTF Technique specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i)of this section, a public water system may use the MTF Technique usingeither five tubes (20-ml sample portions) or a single culture bottle containingthe culture medium for the MTF Technique, i.e., lauryl tryptose broth (formulatedas described in <T3>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, </T3>1985,American Public Health Association <T3>et al., </T3>16th Edition, Method 908A_pp. 872), as long as a 100-mlwater sample is used in the analysis.(5) Public water systems must conduct fecal coliform analysis in accordancewith the following procedure. When the MTF Technique or Presence-Absence(P-A) Coliform Test is used to test for total coliforms, shake the lactose-positivepresumptive tube or P-A bottle vigorously and transfer the growth witha sterile 3-mm loop or sterile applicator stick into brilliant green lactosebile broth and EC medium to determine the presence of total and fecal coliforms,respectively. For EPA-approved analytical methods which use a membrancefilter, remove the membrane containing the total coliform colonies fromthe substrate with a sterile forceps and carefully curl and insert themembrane into a tube of EC medium. (The laboratory may first remove a smallportion of selected colonies for verification.) Gently shake the inoculatedEC tubes to insure adequate mixing and incubate in a waterbath at 44.5andplusmin;0.2 anddegrees;C for 24 andplusmin; 2 hours. Gas production of anyamount in the inner fermentation tube of the EC medium indicates a positivefecal coliform test. The preparation of EC medium is described in <T3>Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, </T3>AmericanPublic Health Association, 16th Edition, Method 908C_pp. 879, paragraph1a. Public water systems need only determine the presence or absence offecal coliforms; a determination of fecal coliform density is not required.(6) These incorporations by reference were approved by the Director ofthe Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR Part51.

Total coliforms are common in the environment and are generallynot harmful themselves. The presence of these bacteria in drinking water,however, generally is a result of a problem with water treatment or thepipes which distribute the water, and indicates that the water may be contaminatedwith organisms that can cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea,cramps, nausea, and possibly jaundice, and any associated headaches andfatigue. These symptoms, however, are not just associated with disease-causingorganisms in drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factorsother than your drinking water. EPA has set an enforceable drinking waterstandard for total coliforms to reduce the risk of these adverse healtheffects. Under this standard, no more than 5.0 percent of the samples collectedduring a month can contain these bacteria, except that systems collectingfewer than 40 samples/month that have one total coliform-positive sampleper month are not violating the standard. Drinking water which meets thisstandard is usually not associated with a health risk from disease-causingbacteria and should be considered safe.(12) <T3>Fecal Coliforms/E. coli</T3> (To be used when there is a violationof andSection; 141.63(b) or both andSection; 141.63(a) and (b)) The UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets drinking water standardsand has determined that the presence of fecal coliforms or <T3>E. coli</T3> is a serious health concern. Fecal coliforms and <T3>E. coli</T3> are generally not harmful themselves, but their presencein drinking water is serious because they usually are associated with sewageor animal wastes. The presence of these bacteria in drinking water is generallya result of a problem with water treatment or the pipes which distributethe water, and indicates that the water may be contaminated with organismsthat can cause disease. Disease symptoms may include diarrhea, cramps,nausea, and possibly jaundice, and associated headaches and fatigue. Thesesymptoms, however, are not just associated with disease-causing organismsin drinking water, but also may be caused by a number of factors otherthan your drinking water. EPA has set an enforceable drinking water standardfor fecal coliforms and <T3>E. coli</T3> to reduce the risk of these adverse health effects. Underthis standard all drinking water samples must be free of these bacteria.Drinking water which meets this standard is associated with little or noneof this risk and should be considered safe.
