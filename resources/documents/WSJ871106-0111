Under the pressure of trying to understand complicated matters in haste, we ourselves erred in describing the convertible debentures Judge Ginsburg held in Rogers Cablesystems Inc. of Toronto.    Based on what we were told by the company and a spokesman for Judge Ginsburg, we reported that the bonds were convertible into stock at the company's option. Now that we've had time to study the company's financial statements, we find that holders had the option of converting the debentures into common stock at a fixed price, and the company had the option of redeeming them at face value plus a premium. In periods when the share price was above the conversion price, holders stood to profit. Rogers called the bonds in March 1986, giving holders the option of the redemption price or conversion into stock. Judge Ginsburg took the conversion, and has since sold the stock.    But as the editorial noted, the position Mr. Ginsburg took in his amicus brief was opposite to what Rogers had declared was in its interest. A Rogers prospectus stating its position has been provided to members of the Judiciary Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
