C. Olivetti andamp; Co. is planning to cutseveral thousand jobs, in addition to reductions announcedearlier this year, as the company grapples with the effectsof the slowdown in demand in the computer industry and theweak dollar, Managing Director Vittorio Cassoni said.   Despite winning a larger slice of the European personalcomputer market in this year's second quarter, the companyhas been pressured to streamline by a squeeze on profitmargins caused by fierce competition.</LP><TEXT>   Revenue increased about 6% in the first half from 3.94trillion lire ($3.39 billion) in the year-earlier period. Butdespite this performance and success in holding down overallcosts, further slimming will be needed, Mr. Cassoni said.   &quot;We are definitely growing faster than the industry,certainly faster than the European industry . . . in terms ofrevenue,&quot; he said. Excluding the effects of exchange-ratefluctuations, revenue grew 8.7%.   Olivetti said revenues at the top 20 U.S. computercompanies increased 7.4% in the first half, a figure closerto 4% once exchange-rate factors were excluded. The figurealso compares with declining, or only slightly growing,revenues at Olivetti's major European competitors.   Mr. Cassoni wouldn't discuss the company's profitperformance, because the board is set to meet next week toreview and announce results for the half. Analysts, however,are pessimistic about Olivetti's profit outlook, and groupChairman Carlo De Benedetti warned shareholders in June that1990 would be a tough year. The group has seen net profitslide to 202.8 billion lire last year from 356.2 billion lirein 1988, 402 billion lire in 1987, and 565.5 billion lire in1986.   &quot;Olivetti is doing well relative to our competition in anenvironment that is worsening,&quot; Mr. Cassoni said. &quot;That said,we are not done with the streamlining of our operations.&quot; Hesaid that the process of cutting back, which the company hadexpected to complete this year, will have to be continued in1991.   The company is planning to shed &quot;a few more thousand&quot; jobsnext year, in addition to the 3,500 jobs being cut this yearfrom the work force of 57,000 on Jan. 1. Those cuts will comeon top of more than 2,000 jobs cut in 1989; so far allreductions have been through voluntary methods.   One reason Olivetti has been particularly hit in the U.S.is its emphasis on bank automation systems. Last year,Olivetti bought ISC Systems Corp. of Spokane, Wash., mergingit with the company's Bunker Ramo Corp. unit.   The move made bank automation Olivetti's biggest singleU.S. business, ahead of sales of office equipment andpersonal computers. But the U.S. economic slowdown, coupledwith the crisis in the savings-and-loan industry, has hurtbusiness.   Nevertheless, Olivetti has no plans to radically reviseits business approach in the U.S. &quot;Banking is the single mostimportant vertical market for Olivetti . . . we're not goingto review that strategy,&quot; Mr. Cassoni said.</TEXT></DOC>
