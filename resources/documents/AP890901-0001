(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Baseball Commissioner A. BartlettGiamatti, who left the presidency of Yale University for the game heloved, died Friday after suffering a heart attack just five monthsinto the sport's top job. He was 51.   Giamatti died at his weekend retreat on Martha's Vineyard eightdays after he banned Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose frombaseball. The decision followed a six-month battle over allegationsthat Rose bet on his own team.   Giamatti, whose wife and son were with him when he died, waspronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. after ``all-out'' efforts to revive himfailed, said Matthew Stockpole of Martha's Vineyard Hospital.   The commissioner was unconscious and in full cardiac arrest whenan ambulance arrived at his home at 3 p.m., the hospital said in astatement. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered in theambulance, and doctors at the hospital worked for more than an hourto revive him.   Giamatti, a chain-smoker who once said cigarettes were his``primary vice,'' left New York in the morning to spend the LaborDay weekend on the popular New England resort island.   Giamatti's death shocked baseball even as it was still recoveringfrom Rose's suspension.   In an interview with The Associated Press two weeks ago, Giamattidismissed the suggestion that he had been overly stressed by theRose matter.   ``While it's a serious matter, it doesn't take most of thetime,'' he said. ``Most of the time is spent ... on other things.The way it's been played, and there's no reason it shouldn't havebeen played, would make you think that I was been sitting here allday worrying about that. But that hasn't been the case for months.''   Rose was ``deeply saddened'' by the news of Giamatti's death, hisattorney, Robert A. Pitcairn, said in a statement issued inCincinnati.   ``In spite of their dispute, Pete had great personal respect forthe commissioner,'' the statement said. ``He extends his deepestsympathy to Commissioner Giamatti's family.''   Giamatti became baseball's seventh commissioner April 1, and wasto have the shortest reign, eclipsing the three years and threemonths of William Eckert from 1965-1969.   Giamatti was the first commissioner to die in office sinceKenesaw Mountain Landis, one of his role models, died in 1944. LikeGiamatti, Landis made his mark with a lifetime ban, against ShoelessJoe Jackson and seven other members of the infamous Chicago BlackSox, who were accused of taking money from a gambler to throw the1919 World Series.   At Boston's Fenway Park, home of Giamatti's beloved Red Sox,flags were lowered to half-staff.   New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said he spoke toGiamatti by phone about 45 minutes before the commissioner wasstricken.   ``I may have been the last person to talk to him. He was happy.We laughed,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We've lost perhaps a trueRenaissance man. Any other commissioner there ever will be will paleby comparison. He was brilliant. He was compassionate. He cared forthe game and cared for its people.''   ``It was a tremendous shock,'' said deputy commissioner FrancisT. Vincent Jr. ``I dropped him off at noon on Martha's Vineyard andhe seemed OK. He had great friends and admirers. Baseball, hisfamily, his friends, the country suffered a big loss. This was auniquely talented man. It's a very sad event, a tragedy for a lot ofpeople.''   President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, said, ``Bartwas a close friend of mine for many, many years. I just want to paymy respects. He was a great person.   ``He loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a realcontribution to the game, standing for the highest possible ethicalstandards,'' said Bush, who played baseball for Yale.   Giamatti, president of the Ivy League school from 1978 to 1985and a specialist in comparative literature, succeeded PeterUeberroth. He had been National League president since December 1986.   ``Baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finestcommissioner in history,'' Ueberroth, vacationing in Paris, said ina statement released through his Newport, Calif., office. ``BartGiamatti encompassed everything that is good and enduring aboutAmerica's favorite pastime. For this man of words, courage and deeds... no words can express the loss.''   ``He gave of himself magnificently to Yale as a teacher, as ascholar and as a leader,'' said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who succeededGiamatti at Yale. ``This university will be a better place becauseof his service. He will never be forgotten at this university.''   Baseball rules call for the executive council, comprised of thetwo league presidents and eight club owners, to oversee the gameuntil a new commissioner is chosen.   Angelo Bartlett Giamatti, born in Boston on April 4, 1938, got anearly start as a baseball administrator _ as manager of the SouthHadley, Mass., high school team in 1951.   But books also deeply attracted the man who would later say thathe always found baseball ``the most satisfying and nourishing ofgames outside of literature.''   Giamatti, an internationally recognized scholar on theRenaissance, was 40 when he became president of Yale, the school'syoungest in 200 years. He had joined the Yale faculty in 1966 afterteaching Italian and comparative literature at Princeton University.   When he took charge of Yale, Giamatti was faced with a budgetdeficit of $2 million, but he balanced the budget in four years.   His most difficult time came in 1984, when more than 2,600clerical and technical workers went on a bitter 10-week strike.About another 1,000 blue-collar workers, including food serviceemployees and janitors, refused to cross the picket lines.   While Yale president, Giamatti emerged as an articulate spokesmanfor a liberal college education. In 1981, he attacked the MoralMajority as ``peddlers of coercion'' and said their aims wereantithetical to a liberal education.   During the AP interview two weeks ago, Giamatti said beingbaseball commissioner was a lot like being a university president.   ``I tell you the truth, this job reminds me much more of the oneI had at Yale. The National League one was much more concerned withwhat went on out on the field.   ``I mean the whole purpose of working in baseball is to rememberthat you're also a fan of baseball. I'm vitally interested in whatgoes on on the field. I was lucky to have those 2{ years in theNational League. It allowed me to have some peripheral engagement,to learn a lot. I like baseball. I try to see as much baseball aspossible,'' he said.   Giamatti is survived by his wife, the former Toni Smith, andthree children: Marcus Bartlett, Paul Edward Valentine and ElenaWalton Giamatti.</TEXT></DOC>
