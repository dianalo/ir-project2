Executives of Japan Aviation Electronics Industry Ltd.,which is 50.2% owned by NEC Corp., admitted Friday that thecompany repaired missile parts for Iran during its lengthywar with Iraq in the 1980s. The actions violate Japan'sstrict ban on military exports.</LP><TEXT>   The Japanese press, quoting police sources, reported overthe weekend that the company also sold new weapons parts toIran. Japan Aviation Electronics officials couldn't bereached to comment on the additional allegations.   During the Iran-Iraq war, several U.S. government andindustry officials were also secretly dealing arms to Iran ina complex web that became known as the Iran-Contra affair. AJapanese government official involved in the currentinvestigation said that at least some of the transactionsmade by Japan Aviation Electronics were requested by the HongKong subsidiary of a U.S. weapons manufacturer, which herefused to identify. He added that the Japanese governmentwas originally tipped off to the transactions by the U.S.government. He wouldn't give any more details, but the policewere quoted in several Japanese newspapers as saying the U.S.query was related to the Iran-Contra matter.   The revelations come less than two weeks before PrimeMinister Toshiki Kaifu plans to propose a new system forinternational disclosure of arms sales at the summit ofleading industrialized nations. Japanese officials,struggling to find an international political role for Japan,have said arms control could be an important area where Japancould take the lead.   Sadaaki Numata, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Fridaythat, despite the news, Japan's arms-export controls are&quot;much more strict than the policies pursued by othercountries.&quot; He added that, &quot;if anything, this particular casegoes to show that on the part of the Japanese government, itis our policy to deal with any suspected cases rigorously.&quot;   Mr. Kaifu said Friday he would &quot;ensure strict treatment&quot;of the company. The government is reportedly consideringtemporarily banning all Japan Aviation Electronics exports aswell as suspending its domestic defense business.   NEC President Tadahiro Sekimoto said at a Friday newsconference that he considered the unit's actions regrettable,but said that &quot;it's a separate company&quot; and that NECofficials had no knowledge of the matter. The probeapparently is focusing only on the subsidiary.   At a separate news conference, Japan Aviation Electronicssenior managing director Koichi Kondo said, &quot;We haverepeatedly educated {employees} after 1987&quot; -- the time aToshiba Corp. subsidiary admitted to selling militarilyuseful technology to the Soviet Union -- &quot;but overseeingwasn't enough. We are very sorry.&quot;   Although the alleged transgression is controversialbecause of Japan's longstanding weapons-export policy, thesize of the deal appears to be quite small -- particularlycompared with revelations during the Persian Gulf War aboutboth legal and illegal weapons materials that American andEuropean companies supplied to Iraq.   Japan Aviation Electronics said it was paid about 35million yen (about $250,000) for repairing the parts. Theamount was so minuscule for the company, which reported 77.6billion yen in revenue in the year ended March 31, that Mr.Kondo said top executives weren't even aware of the repairsat the time. The alleged sales reported in the weekend pressof new parts to Iran totaled 700 million yen.   Japan Aviation Electronics said it received orders from acompany in Hong Kong starting as early as late 1987 throughMarch 1989 to repair as many as 1,500 small &quot;flywheels.&quot; Mr.Kondo said the equipment has many civilian uses. But headmitted that these parts, after being shipped from Japan toSingapore, went to Iran, where they were used as part of aguidance device for U.S.-designed Sidewinder missiles thatIran obtained when it was allied with the U.S.   Mr. Kondo said that the employees handling the partsweren't initially aware they were doing military work, butdid find out while they were performing the repairs anddidn't discontinue the business. Mr. Kondo also said that wasthe first time his company did business with the U.S.company.   But the Japanese press said Saturday that Japanese police-- who raided 13 company offices Friday -- believe JapanAviation Electronics also sold aviation gyroscopes andaccelerometers to Iran from around 1982 through 1984 for useon U.S.-made F-4 Phantom jets.   Japanese officials said the raid followed a tip from U.S.authorities that Japan Aviation Electronics could have beeninvolved in unauthorized shipments to Iran. Tokyo is alsopursuing the possibility that the shipments could also havebeen the work of professional arms brokers, the officialssaid.   In Washington, the U.S. State Deparment said it isfollowing the progress of the investigation to see whetherany U.S. export-control laws were violated by the shippers ofthe parts, although there is no indication so far that anyviolation of U.S. law occurred.   U.S. officials wouldn't confirm what type of U.S.investigation might have triggered the Japanese policeaction.   Although the Japanese government prohibits the export ofmilitary goods, the policy does allow for the export ofproducts that have both civilian and military uses, such assemiconductors or personal computers.   A handful of Japanese companies have been caught inmilitary export scandals, most notably the Toshiba affair.But in those cases, the goods did have civilian applicationsand the controversy instead involved shipping restrictedtechnologies to communist countries. The Japan AviationElectronics case, however, appears to be the first time aJapanese company has been accused of shipping overseasexplicitly military goods, and doing so to an area of activeconflict.   ---   Eduardo Lachica in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
