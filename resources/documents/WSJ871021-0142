If history is an indicator, a strong defense can deter aggressive acts. Subsequently, I cannot understand the reasoning behind opposition to the research and eventual deployment of the strategic defense initiative. Opponents often argue that SDI isn't a foolproof defense. Although SDI isn't a 100% effective defense, I challenge anyone to name a defense that is.    If this country follows the thinking of SDI opponents, U.S. defenses would cease to exist because every defensive weapon, from jets to soldiers, isn't completely effective all of the time. And while this country would be free from less-than-perfect defenses, America would soon be invaded by countries using such weapons.    James Picerno   Spotswood, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
