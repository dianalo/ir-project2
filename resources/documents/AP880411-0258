On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May deliveryof West Texas intermediate crude jumped from $16.88 per 42-gallonbarrel Friday to $17.65, an unusually large move that put prices atthe highest point since Jan. 5.   Experts differed over whether the rise was a short-termdevelopment or reflected a reversal in what has been a dismal oilmarket.   ``The OPEC thing is clearly the reason, there's no questionabout it,'' said John O'Dea, manager of international energyfutures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``Whether itshould be that strong or not, who knows. My attitude has been, talkis cheap with that crowd.''   The market move followed disclosures that leaders of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would invitegovernment representatives from at least seven independentoil-producing nations to meet with five OPEC oil ministers on April23. All 13 OPEC members are to meet two days later.   The invitation, announced by a committee of five OPEC oilministers on Saturday, was seen as a clear acknowledgement by thecartel that it alone no longer can exert enough control over oilsupplies to support prices.   Some analysts said the market's rise today reflected a morefundamental change in sentiment toward rising prices, and the OPECdevelopment was merely an excuse to buy.   ``This is not a flash in the pan. This is the beginning of abull move,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of EldersFutures Inc. in New York. ``The real story is the oil market cyclehas turned; it's ready to go higher.''</TEXT></DOC>
