It has been determined that the provisionsof this rule will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more; (2) major increases in costs of prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of UnitedStates-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto the interim rule since Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) nor the Commodity Credit Corporations (CCC) is required by 5 U.S.C.553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemakingwith respect to the subject matter of this rule. It has been determinedby an environmental envaluation that this action will have no significantimpact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84"> Proposed Rule</ITAG>On October 5, 1987, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 52 FR 37160 with respect to the manner inwhich the rate of interest that is generally applicable to CCC loans wouldbe determined and announced. No comments were received in response to thisproposed rule. Accordingly, the provisions of this proposed rule are adoptedwithout change.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interim Rule</ITAG>On June 3, 1988, an interim rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 20280 which amended the regulationsgoverning Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs. This interimrule amended Chapter XIV of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationspertaining to the functions of Commodity Credit Corporation, Departmentof Agriculture to include the regulations which set forth the terms andconditions of the CCC production adjustment programs at 7 CFR Part 713and the terms and conditions under which CCC may make payments in a formother than cash set forth at 7 CFR Part 770. These regulations were formerlyset forth in Chapter VII of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationspertaining to the functions of ASCS.

The response, submitted on behalf of the Georgia Agricultural CommodityCommission for Peanuts, indicated that the impact would not be very greaton the peanut growers represented since those growers seldom use farm-storedloans. The respondent stated that the interim rule would be most importantto the growers in Virginia and Carolina, where the types of peanuts grownare different from those grown in Georgia, and expressed support of theposition of growers in those areas on the interim rule. The respondentultimately saw the interim rule as causing no negative impact on the peanutindustry as a whole. No other comments were received.Accordingly, the regulations as set forth in the interim rule publishedat 53 FR 20280 are adopted as a final rule without any changes other thanthe changes made in this final rule for the purposes of grammar and clarity,and to delete the reference to an obsolete form.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 713Feed grain, Rice, Upland and extra long staple cotton, Wheat and relatedprograms.7 CFR Part 770Commodity certificates, In-Kind payments, Other forms of payment.7 CFR Part 1405Feed grain, Rice, Upland cotton, Wheat and related programs, Grains, Loanprograms/Agriculture, Price support programs, Warehouse commodity certificates,In-Kind payments, Other forms of payment. 7 CFR Part 1421Grains, Loan programs/Agriculture, Price support programs, Warehouses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations is revised as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1405_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
