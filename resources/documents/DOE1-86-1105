The coincidence of diagnoses based on X-ray and CT findings wasnoted in 26 patients, in 11 patients CT findings led to more accurateconclusions than those in roentgenography, and further to a correct diagnosisresulting from differential-diagnostic features. Unlike roentgenographytypical tumor symptoms were revealed on CT in such cases. Interpretationof the results using both methods was erroneous in 12 patients. In 2patients X-ray diagnosis was correct, CT diagnosis was erronous. A conclusionwas made that CT results of bone lesions could be regarded as verifiedmorphological diagnosis which would be of value when histological diagnosisand interpretation of X-ray finding were difficult.</TEXT></DOC>
