The chief aim of this test is the investigation of possiblecracking due to the thermal load on the salt. Furthermore, questionson the gas liberation, brine migration, existing compression gradientsand permeability changes of the salt are being considered. Followinga short presentation of the test set up, the results of thermomechanicalcalculations and estimations are introduced. The results of homogeneousrocks show that macroscopic cracks in unworked rocks are not to be expectedduring the heating phase. According to the prototype model cracking mayoccur after several months in case of sudden shutdown of the heaters.Here the calculations in the centre of the heating area show a rathersharply defined region with cracking. In the case of a continuous shutdownof the heaters over a longer period of time fracturing of the salt rockwill not occur. 17 refs.; 20 figs. refs.</TEXT></DOC>
