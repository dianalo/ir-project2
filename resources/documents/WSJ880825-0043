Sales grew 56% to $461 million.    The results surpassed the estimates of Wall Street analysts, though they have expected improvement at chemical makers, including Himont. Alexander F. Giacco, Himont's chairman and chief executive officer, said the Wilmington, Del., company &quot;made significant progress during the quarter in its strategy to grow its core polypropylene business while also moving aggressively to expand into the advanced materials market.&quot;    In the year-earlier quarter, Himont earned $53 million, or 82 cents a share, on sales of $295 million.    For the nine months ended July 31, net income rose 62% to $272 million, or $4.16 a share, from $168 million, or $2.86 a share. Sales increased 52% to $1.26 billion from $833 million.    Himont shares closed yesterday at $36.75, up $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
