ProsperiandM;Assistant Secretary for Public AffairsandM;U.S.andP;  Department of TransportationandM;Washington, D.C.andM;.  .  .  GROUNDED IN STUPIDITYandM;To the Editor:andM;I represent my company in national and international standards committeesrelated to modems and data communications.andM;As a frequent traveler who considers my laptop an indispensible tool, Iapplaud your May 15 editorial strongly protesting the proposed ban on laptopcomputers on commercial flights.andM;However, the situation is actually much worse than you make it out to be.andO;The proposed ban is not only on equipment carried into the airplane cabin,but also on checked baggage.andP;  In other words, if you were planning to take alaptop with you on a business trip, you would have to travel by train or bybus.andM;Furthermore, the ban would apply not only to computers, but also to all formsof electronic and electrical equipment, including (according to theTransportation Department) hair dryers, shavers, cameras with light meters orany other electronic features, radios, cassette and CD players, dictationequipment, portable typewriters, video cameras -- anything with any kind ofelectrical or electronic circuit.andM;And again, not just carry-on items, but checked-in baggage as well.andM;Remember: The tape player that downed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie was inthe cargo hold, not in the passenger cabin.andM;It is ironic that even if this ban were to be imposed, assault rifles andother weapons of destruction could still be checked-in baggage.andM;Travelers must become as angry over this proposal as members of the NRA wouldbecome over a similar proposal to ban all weapons from checked-in baggage --and more so.andM;You are absolutely right that this insane ban would do absolutely nothing toprevent a determined terrorist from blowing up an airplane.andM;Toby L.
