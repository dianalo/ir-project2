It is felt that the expansion of the energy resource base,both renewable and non-renewable, cannot occur without increased utilizationof hydrogen. The report presents the current situation of hydrogen productionand consumption in Canada, and contains an incomplete list of potentialapplications of hydrogen. Some are based on development opportunitiesunique to Canada while others are more general in nature. Technical problemsof hydrogen development and alternatives to hydrogen use are also examinedwith the view that energy decisions should be made on a case-by-casebasis. For example, where a carbon source is easily accessible, methanemay be a better choice than hydrogen. The issue of whether a hydrogen-basedeconomy would be consistent with national goals is examined. One ideais that future energy needs will be satisfied by a small number of energyforms; hydrogen is a possible type of common energy distribution mediumthat would appear to be in Canada's best interest. In analyzing thisquestion, it is possible that technical and economic assumptions canoverly enhance certain alternatives at the expense of others. For example,ignoring the by-products of electrolysis of water may have a negativeimpact on the perceived economics of that method of hydrogen production.It is certain that hydrogen, by itself or after reaction with carbon,will play a vital role in Canada's energy future, particularly if a diverseenergy system is chosen on a case-by-case basis, a scenario which seemsto be consistent with present government policy.
