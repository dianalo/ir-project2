The Haaretz newspaper also said Levy blocked the delivery of amessage Shamir wanted to send to Egyptian leaders through theIsraeli Embassy in Cairo last week.   Shamir's new right-wing government assumed power last week.   Levy is the No. 2 man in the Likud bloc, and his aspirations toeventually replace Shamir as Likud leader have caused past diputesbetween the two.   In Shamir's last Cabinet, Levy was a chief critic of U.S. peaceplans, but he has taken a more moderate stance since taking overthe Foreign Ministry.   Levy's spokeswoman, Aliza Goren, said in a telephone interviewtoday that the reports of disagreement between Shamir and Levy were``an exaggeration and blown out of proportion.''   Levy, 52, was hospitalized last week after a mild heart attack.He has begun working from his sickbed and is expected to bereleased this weekend.   Israeli-U.S. ties have been strained in the past year because ofdisagreement over Middle East policies and the American dialoguewith the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.   Haaretz said aides to Levy were annoyed by statements madeFriday by Shamir's top political adviser, Yossi Ben-Aharon.   Ben-Aharon suggested on Army radio that Israel wanted to shelvepeace proposals raised last year by Secretary of State James A.Baker III as a way to revive Israel's stalled initiative forPalestinian elections.   ``We are asking to start from the beginning,'' Ben-Aharon said.   According to Haaretz, Levy's aides considered the remark, amongothers coming from Shamir's office, to be ``unneccesary instigationat a sensitive moment.''   Haaretz did not say what was in the censored message to Cairo.It said Ben-Aharon sent it to the Israeli Embassy in Egypt lastweek and that Levy ordered staff members not to deliver it.   The newspaper said Levy was angry that he had not been consultedbefore the message was sent to Egypt, the only Arab country to makepeace with Israel and a key middleman in negotiations with thePalestinians.   Shamir himself sharply criticized the United States today forcontinuing a dialogue with the PLO despite an aborted seaborneattack May 30 that was claimed by a PLO faction.   ``Week after week passes and they are still holdingconsultations, there in the political offices in the United States,about whether indeed the PLO is still a terrorist organization,''Shamir told students in a speech in a Tel Aviv suburb.   The United States has demanded that the PLO condemn the abortedraid as a condition for continuing diplomatic contacts that began18 months ago in the PLO's home base of Tunis. So far the PLO hasonly indirectly criticized the action.</TEXT></DOC>
