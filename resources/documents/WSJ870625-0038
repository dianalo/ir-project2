But speaking to securities analysts here, William H. Springer, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said the company will post an earnings gain of 6% to 8% for all of 1987, in line with its longer-term goal.    Half the growth will be contributed by the regional Bell holding company's unregulated, or non-telephone, businesses, which the company said will be profitable for the first time this year. The Chicago-based company expects revenue for those operations to jump 20% to 30% from 1986's $878.5 million, said Mr. Springer. The unregulated businesses include publishing, phone equipment, cellular telephone, software and credit units.    Mr. Springer and William L. Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer, also conveyed an upbeat outlook for the long term, including a forecast of new annual revenue totaling $750 million by the mid-1990s from electronic information services, assuming the company will be allowed to provide such services. Under the rules of the Bell System breakup, the regional Bell concerns currently are legally prohibited from that market, but the Reagan administration has proposed ending that ban.    In last year's second quarter, per-share earnings totaled $1.96 on revenue of $2.35 billion. The flat revenue for the current quarter reflects a &quot;shortfall&quot; in revenue from the company's Illinois Bell unit because of a recent restructuring of phone rates. Depreciation and wages are also higher, Ameritech said. Revenue from making long-distance connections is also down, the result of lowering of such charges that the Federal Communications Commission ordered for all phone companies.    Ameritech also said it expects to limit future dividend increases to 7.8% a year. The company's cash dividend currently is $5 a share.    By forecasting annual revenue of $750 million in information services, Mr. Springer offered the most details yet of any regional Bell company about prospects in prohibited markets to which the Baby Bells are seeking entry.    In addition to electronic information services, the regional operating companies can't provide interstate long-distance calls or make phone equipment. Next week, Judge Harold Greene will be begin hearings on lifting the restrictions. The judge, who oversees the breakup, is expected to make a decision later this year. </TEXT></DOC>
