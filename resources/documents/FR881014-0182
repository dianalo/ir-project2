Explanation.</T3> This publication announces the adoption of theAmerican National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive GraphicsSystem, ANSI X3.144-1988, as a Federal Information Processing Standard(FIPS). This standard specifies the control and data interchange betweenan application program and its graphic support system. It provides a setof functions and programming language bindings (or toolbox package) forthe definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional(3D) graphical data. In addition, this standard supports highly interactiveprocessing and geometric articulation, multi-level or hierarchical graphicdata, and rapid modification of both the graphics data and the relationshipsbetween the graphical data. The purpose of the standard is to promote portabilityof graphics application programs between different installations. The standardis for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing graphicssoftware systems; and by other computer professionals who need to knowthe precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard. <T3>4.

Objectives. </T3>The primary objectives of this standard are: _To allow very highly interactive graphics application programs using 2Dor 3D hierarchically structured graphics data to be easily transportedbetween installations. This will reduce costs associated with the transferof programs among different computers and graphics devices, including replacementdevices._To aid the understanding and use of dynamic hierarchical graphics methodsby application programmers._To aid manufacturers of graphics equipment by serving as a guideline foridentifying useful combinations of graphics capabilities in a device._To encourage more effective utilization and management of graphics applicationprogrammers by ensuring that skills acquired on one job are transportableto other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of graphics programmer retraining._To aid graphics application programmers in understanding and using graphicsmethods by specifying well-defined functions and names. This will avoidthe confusion of incompatibility common with operating systems and programminglanguages.9. <T3>Applicability. </T3>a. This standard is intended for use in computergraphics applications that are either developed or acquired for governmentuse. It is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements ofsuch demanding applications as Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/ComputerAided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular modelling, simulationand process control. It emphasizes the support of applications needinga highly dynamic, highly interactive operator interface and expecting rapidscreen update of complex images to be performed by the display system.b. The use of this standard is compulsory and binding when one or moreof the following situations exist:_The graphics application is very highly interactive, or contains hierarchicallystructured graphics data, or requires rapid modification of 2D or 3D graphicsdata and the relationships among the data._It is anticipated that the life of the graphics program will be longerthan the life of the presently utilized graphics equipment._The graphics application or program is under constant review for updatingof the specifications, and changes may result frequently._The graphics application is being designed and programmed centrally fora decentralized system that employs computers of different makes and modelsand different graphics devices._The graphics program will or might be run on equipment other than thatfor which the program is initially written._The graphics program is to be understood and maintained by programmersother than the original ones._The graphics program is or is likely to be used by organizations outsidethe Federal government (i.e., State and local governments, and others).c. Nonstandard features of implementations of PHIGS should be used onlywhen the needed operation or function cannot reasonably be implementedwith the standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can bevery useful, it should be recognized that the use of these or any othernonstandard elements may make the interchange of graphics programs andfuture conversion more difficult and costly. <T3>10. Specifications.</T3> American National Standard Programmer's HierarchicalInteractive Graphics System, ANSI X3.144-1988, defines the scope of thespecifications, the syntax and semantics of the PHIGS elements and requirementsfor conforming implementations. All of these specifications apply to FederalGovernment implementations of this standard.ANSI X3.144-1988 defines a language independent nucleus of a graphics systemfor integration into a programming language. Thus, it is embedded in alanguage layer obeying the particular conventions of the language. Thismeans that the standard is separated into two parts. Part 1 representsthe functional aspects of PHIGS. Part 2 contains bindings of PHIGS functionsto actual programming languages. These bindings are developed in cooperationwith the voluntary industry standards committees of the various languages.A binding of the PHIGS functionality to the Programming Language FORTRAN(ANSI X3.9-1978), known as FORTRAN '77, appears in the first version ofthis standard. Subsequent language bindings for C, Ada, PASCAL, etc., willbe added periodically as they become available.As these bindings are approved by ANSI, each language binding will becomepart of this standard.<T3>11. Implementation.</T3> The implementation of this standard involvestwo areas of consideration: Acquisition of implementations and itnerpretationsof this standard.<T3>11.1 Acquisition of Implementations.</T3> This standard becomes effectiveApril 28, 1989. Implementations which meet the requirements of the applicabilitysection and acquired after this date should comply with this standard.Conformance to this standard should be considered whether toolbox packagesare developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement,used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contractsfor programming services.A transition period provides time for industry to produce toolbox packagesconforming to the standard. The transition period begins on the effectivedate and continues for twelve (12) months thereafter. The provisions ofthis publication apply to orders placed after the date of this publication;however, a toolbox package not conforming to this standard may be acquiredfor interim use during the transition period. <T3>11.2 Interpretation of this FIPS.</T3> Resolution of questions regardingthis standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the contentand specifications should be addressed to:<ITAG tagnum="15">Director, National Computer and Telecommunications Laboratory, ATTN:PHIGS Interpretation, National Institution of Standards and Technology,Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</ITAG><T3>12. Waivers. </T3>Under certain exceptional circumstances, the headsof Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of Title 44, United States Code. Requests for waivers shall be grantedonly when:a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, orb. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Government-wide savings. Agency heads may approve requests for waivers only by a written decisionwhich explains the basis upon which the agency head made the required finding(s).A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classifiedportions clearly identified, shall be sent to: Director, National Computerand Telecommunications Laboratory, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, TechnologyBuilding, Room B-154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg,MD 20899. In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegationof authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committeeon Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committeeon Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.When the determination on a waiver request applies to the procurement ofequipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must bepublished in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3> as a part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice.A copy of the waiver request, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver request and any supporting and accompanying documents, withsuch deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5U.S.C. andSection; 552(b), shall be part of the procurement documentationand retained by the agency.<T3>13.
