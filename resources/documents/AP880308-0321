The producers of the Academy Awards had asked that the guildallow the writers to continue working on the show.   ``The board of directors of the Writers Guild of America Westvoted unanimously this evening to deny the request for waiver fromthe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science for the AcademyAwards ceremonies,'' said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.   ``What that means is that Writers Guild writers will not bewriting the Academy Awards ceremonies,'' Ms. Rhoden added.   The strike by 9,000 members of the Writers Guild of Americaagainst the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producersbegan Monday, a week after their contract expired.   Bob Werden, spokesman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts andSciences, had said earlier Tuesday that the academy had asked forthe waiver. In past strikes, entertainment unions have usuallygranted waivers for the Oscars.   Without the waiver, ``we'll struggle on somehow,'' he had said.   Scriptwriter Mel Shavelson, former WGA president, and anotherunion member, Jack Rose, were hired by the academy to write theprogram, which is scheduled to be televised worldwide by ABC-TV onApril 11.   ``If there is no waiver, I won't do the show,'' Shavelson saidTuesday, adding the writing was far from complete. ``Most of thework is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal. It's rewriting,really.   ``If there is no waiver, you will find out how good actors areat ad-libbing,'' he said. In general, writers provide most materialfor the hosts and presenters at the ceremony; the winners' thanksare their own.   Meanwhile, a federal mediator brought together negotiators for9,000 striking scriptwriters and entertainment producers Tuesday tooutline differences in a walkout the union says could crippleHollywood.   Bargainers for the writers and the producers began meeting atmidday with commissioner Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediationand Conciliation Service.   In the early evening the meeting was recessed until 11 a.m.Thursday.   Both sides outlined differences and issues, but no bargainingwas conducted, said alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg. Stickingpoints were writers' demands for increased fees and creative rights.   The final offer by producers was rejected by the guild Sundayand talks broke off. No new bargaining sessions were scheduled.   About 2,000 pickets gathered Monday outside 20th Century Foxstudios. Meanwhile, producers urged writers to defy the picketlines and said temporary replacements may be hired.   There were no large picket line demonstrations Tuesday.   As the writers marched, alliance president and chief negotiatorNick Counter said producers may begin hiring temporary replacementsfor striking writers until a settlement was reached.   ``Our companies are encouraging whoever wants to come forward towrite these scripts,'' he said, urging union and non-union writersto cross picket lines.   Counter said non-guild writers were being sought to keep soapoperas afloat and to keep the wheels turning on Hollywood's gameshow circuit.   While the writer's guild said talk shows and soap operas wouldbe the first to feel the effects of the strike, probably turning toreruns, the producers said other shows had stockpiled scripts.   The WGA strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973.The longest, in 1981, lasted three months.   ``It's the same kind of feeling as we had in 1981,'' Countersaid, predicting the strike may be an extended one. ``This could goon even longer than that.''   Speaking for the producers, Steinberg said: ``We feel all theissues were dealt with fairly. They went on strike on issues wefelt were resolved.'' He added that producers were ``ready to writea check for $550 million'' for a new three-year contract. Thealliance represents about 200 producers and studios.  </TEXT></DOC>
