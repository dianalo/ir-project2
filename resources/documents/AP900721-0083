After slowly gaining a presence in local and state government,blacks are making unprecedented runs for office in a region onceknown for racial discrimination.   Though he failed to place first, Young has made it to an Aug. 7runoff for the Democratic nomination for governor. Two other blacksare trying to win top elections elsewhere in the South.   In North Carolina, Harvey Gantt is the Democratic nominee tryingto unseat Republican Sen. Jesse Helms; in South Carolina, stateSen. Theo Mitchell has won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.   But Young, Gantt and Mitchell each are running against strongcandidates, as well as a history that says voters in thepredominantly white states generally cast ballots along raciallines.   Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman, U.N. ambassador andcivil rights movement veteran, finished 12 percentage points onTuesday behind the front-runner _ Zell Miller, a four-termlieutenant governor.   Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., is up against Helms,a nationally known incumbent who has been in office 18 years.Mitchell, a state senator from Greenville, S.C., is challengingRepublican Gov. Carroll Campbell, a popular incumbent with strongties to the Bush administration.   Despite numerous differences between the three candidates, theiropponents and their states, the three are bound by more than justthe physical fact that they're black, said David Ruffin of theJoint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black-orientedthink tank in Washington.   ``All these candidates are using politics to renegotiate thecompact between society and blacks,'' said Ruffin, who edits thecenter's Focus magazine. ``All of them are looking for change. Thebig difference is in the conditions in which they're running.''   The nation has no black senators and one black governor,Virginia's L. Douglas Wilder, who was elected last year.   Since winning the Democratic runoff in North Carolina in June,Gantt has been on the road meeting voters, trying to offset thefinancial advantage held by Helms, an archconservative who someconsider politically vulnerable this year.   ``We think what we're doing is building support that is deep andwon't be swayed by Helms' 30-second (television) barrages,'' saidSusan Jetton, Gantt's press secretary.   Ms. Jetton said the Gantt campaign is finding plenty ofanti-Helms sentiment across the state.   ``He will have plenty of money and help in running againstHelms,'' said Earl Black, a political science professor at theUniversity of South Carolina. ``There is so much opposition toHelms that any Democratic candidate can expect good financing.''   But even some black supporters of Gantt aren't counting outHelms.   Tyrone Brooks, a black Georgia state legislator who supportsGantt, said he was nonetheless skeptical about Gantt's chances inthe North Carolina election.   Brooks was asked about the North Carolinian earlier this monthduring a federal court hearing on a so-far-unsuccessful suitchallenging the runoff provision of Georgia's election law. Hetestified that Gantt's runoff victory was an ``aberration'' and notrepresentative of the climate for black candidates in Southernstatewide elections.   ``You can't say that because Mr. Gantt won in North Carolina,that we're going to win every runoff,'' Brooks said.   Many political observers said the second-place finish in theGeorgia primary was a disappointment for Young, who was well knownand ran as a moderate stressing his talent for attracting businessinvestment.   But Young failed to win strong white support, and urban blacksfailed to give him the overwhelming backing he counted on.   Young said the morning after the primary vote was counted thathe was unsure why the black vote was smaller than he wanted.   Mitchell, on the other hand, attracted a sizable black vote inthe Democratic primary and has been campaigning regularly at blackchurches, said Black.   Mitchell soundly defeated state Sen. Ernest Passailaigue, awhite, in the Democratic primary, earning 60 percent of the vote.Election officials said voter turnout was low overall but thatMitchell was helped by the high black turnout. He remains theunderdog in the general election campaign, however.   Keith R. Billingsley, an associate professor of politicalscience at the University of Georgia, said Young's success withblack voters may have been reduced because his two terms as mayorof predominantly black Atlanta were not an unqualified successamong the city's residents.   ``A number of black folks have told me they did not respect theway he ran the city, especially the police department,''Billingsley said.   Race has not emerged as an overt issue in any of the campaigns,though there is a definite racial undercurrent, said Billingsley.   Young and Miller each have promised that the candidates' recordswill be the issue in their runoff campaign.   ``They're going to talk about it (the record), and the votersare going to look at their color,'' Billingsley said.</TEXT></DOC>
