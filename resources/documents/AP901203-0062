Wolfgang Ziegler, the lawyer, said the ousted Communist partyboss claimed he is not guilty according to criminal codes thatexisted when he was ruling what was then East Germany, the agencyreported.   Ziegler said it was important to determine whether Honeckerviolated firearms laws of former East Germany, what the laws said,and how they fit in with the current penal code in effect in aunited Germany.   The lawyer said, however, that Honecker should answerpolitically and morally for acts committed as Communist leader.Honecker, 78, is wanted by German police on charges he signed theshoot-to kill orders.   Soviet military officials have prevented German police fromserving an arrest warrant to Honecker, who is at a Soviet militaryhospital outside Beelitz, in former East Germany 20 miles south ofBerlin.   Earlier today, Soviet military doctors ordered Honecker into acardiology unit at the Red Army hospital, German radio reported.   The Sender Freies Berlin radio station quoted a Sovietinterpreter as saying Soviet doctors considered Honecker'scondition ``serious.'' Honecker sought refuge at the hospital inApril.   A Soviet military doctor with the rank of colonel diagnosedHonecker as having high blood pressure, the ADN news agency quotedIgor Molotkin, the interpreter, as saying.   The agency said Honecker's wife, Margot, called the doctor earlythis morning and the ousted party boss was carried on a stretcherto a cardiology department for treatment.   German police need permission from Soviet authorities to enterthe hospital complex. A Soviet diplomat said Sunday that thedecision on whether Honecker can be turned over to Germanauthorities would have to be made at the highest level, presumablyin Moscow.   A Soviet official at the embassy in Bonn refused to comment on areport that talks were under way between German and Sovietofficials on handing over Honecker, whose testimony could bepotentially damaging to Moscow.   Berlin justice officials issued the warrant on Friday, just twodays before the first free elections in a united Germany in 58years. They based the warrant on new documents recently uncoveredthat incriminate Honecker.   Honecker's lawyers maintain he is too sick to stand trial.   The arrest warrant charges Honecker with personally signingshoot-to-kill orders to guards at the Berlin Wall - the borderbetween former East and West Germany.   The warrant also links Honecker directly to the deaths ofseveral people killed while trying to flee the repressive EastGerman regime before it was toppled in last year's peacefulrevolution.   Some 200 people died trying to escape from East Germany duringthe 28-year existence of the Berlin Wall and the barbed wirebarrier that separated the two German states.   Honecker also rejected ``responsibility'' for issuing theshoot-to-kill orders in comments published Nov. 1 in theLondon-based weekly newspaper, The European.</TEXT></DOC>
