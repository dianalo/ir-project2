Karcher, chairman and chief executive officer of Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., and six members of his family agreed to pay $664,000 to settle insider-trading charges.    The preliminary pact with the Securities and Exchange Commission is subject to court approval.    The SEC alleged that members of Mr. Karcher's family used advance knowledge of a plunge in profit to sell stock in the Anaheim, Calif., fast-food chain in 1984. Mr. Karcher himself isn't alleged to have sold any stock at that time.    Under the proposed settlement, Mr. Karcher will pay a fine of $332,000 to the SEC. His relatives, whom he allegedly tipped off, will pay a further $332,000, representing losses the SEC says they avoided by selling stock on inside knowledge.    According to the proposed consent decree, neither Mr. Karcher nor his relatives will admit or deny the charges. Mr. Karcher, who faced fines of as much as $996,000, has declined to make any comment on the agreement, a secretary said.    Yesterday, Carl Karcher Enterprises stock slid $1.25 a share, to close at $15.75 in national over-the-counter trading.    The current agreement follows an aborted settlement attempt last May that foundered when lawyers for Mr. Karcher and his family sought assurances that no criminal charges would be lodged against them. The proposed settlement of SEC civil allegations doesn't contain any such agreement, said John C. Koutsos, SEC counsel.    Apparently also in process is a separate agreement with Alvin A. DeShano, the director of accounting at Carl Karcher Enterprises, who in June was acquitted of criminal fraud and insider trading. The anticipated pact would settle the SEC's civil allegations against Mr. DeShano. The initial case filed by the SEC in April 1988 alleged that 16 people were involved in insider activities. Since that filing, six family members agreed to pay back more than $187,500. In September 1988, one of Mr Karcher's sons was found to have breached insider-trading laws and was required to repay $10,500. Charges against Mr. Karcher's wife, Margaret, were dropped earlier this year. </TEXT></DOC>
