The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 5.80 to 2095.99, closing at its highest level since last October's crash for the second consecutive session. The average jumped more than 28 points Friday and gained a total of 102 points last week.    Traders said stock prices initially slumped yesterday morning as oil prices soared after last weekend's decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to renew its efforts to seek cooperation from nonmember producers. May crude oil futures rose more than a dollar a barrel in New York trading and closed just below the $18-a-barrel level, OPEC's official selling price for crude oil.    The surge in oil prices drove rates up as long-term Treasury bonds due to mature in 30 years dropped more than a point, or $10 per $1,000 of face value.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.73 to 270.16 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.44 to 152.47.    Advancing issues topped decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the Big Board, where 146.4 million shares changed hands. On Friday, 169.3 million shares were traded on that exchange.    The higher rates and increase in oil prices were additional worries for investors, who were already concerned about the forthcoming report on the February merchandise trade deficit. Ernie Rudnet, manager of block trading at Mabon Nugent andamp; Co., says he expects the market to be nervous and quiet until Thursday, when the government releases the trade data. A survey of economists by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report indicates that the trade deficit should have narrowed to $11.3 billion in February from $12.4 billion in January.    &quot;If the numbers are fairly decent, the market will continue on its upward path. Right now, people are just sitting back and watching,&quot; Mr. Rudnet said.    A.C. Moore, director of economic research at Argus Research Corp., asserted that higher oil prices &quot;are probably sending a ripple of inflation fear through financial markets.&quot; Lower energy prices have been largely responsible for the relatively modest rise in consumer prices since the start of the year, and any pickup in that sector could push overall prices higher.    Besides oil, other commodity prices also posted hefty increases yesterday. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 futures contracts rose 1.27, to 235.96.    However, Mr. Moore also noted that the boost in oil prices wasn't entirely detrimental for some stocks, as oil and oil-related issues account for more than 20% of the Big Board's outstanding market value. Any price rise would give the market &quot;an undertone of some stability,&quot; he said.    The American Stock Exchange Index, which is largely composed of smaller oil company issues, surged 3.20 to 303.69. But the Dow Jones Transportation Index fell more than four points, reflecting the impact of higher fuel costs on airlines and railroads.    Charles F. Eaton III, an investment strategist at Nikko Securities International, said he believes the Dow industrials are due to rise 50 to 75 points during the next several weeks as blue-chip issues catch up to the rest of the market.    However, he cautioned that any advance from current levels would be part of a longer-term rally in what remains a bear market. &quot;We would be heavier sellers, strategic sellers, if the market rallied much more from here over the next week or two,&quot; he said.    Oil stocks generally moved higher in response to the advance in oil prices. British Petroleum gained 1 7/8 to 61 7/8, Amoco climbed 1 5/8 to 79, Mobil rose 3/8 to 48, USX added 5/8 to 32 and Chevron went up 1/8 to 49 1/4.    The upturn in oil prices also benefited oil field-services issues. Baker Hughes added 3/4 to 19 3/4, Halliburton rose 1/2 to 36, Rowan Cos. climbed 3/8 to 8 1/2, Ocean Drilling andamp; Research advanced 1 1/8 to 20 1/4 and Smith International gained 3/4 to 9 3/4.    Quaker State jumped 3 1/2 to 26 1/8 following a $26.50-a-share takeover offer from a group led by Ardshiel Inc., a New York investment banking firm.    Primerica dropped 1/2 to 27 1/4. The company agreed to sell three insurance units to American National Insurance for an estimated $241 million and agreed to sell its 81% stake in Musicland Group to a group led by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette for $410 million. While the sale of the Musicland unit will generate a gain for Primerica, the sale of the insurance units will produce a one-time after-tax loss of $50.9 million for the company. Also, an article in Barron's said Primerica may be facing tough times amid shaky prospects for earnings. Musicland added 1 1/8 to 34.    Kansas City Southern Industries plunged 5 1/8 to 39 7/8 after being found guilty in an antitrust suit brought by South Dakota, which accused the company of conspiring to restrain trade in coal transportation. The company, which plans to appeal the ruling, said damages in the case could run as high as $844.2 million.    J.P. Stevens gained 1/2 to 66 1/2. West Point-Pepperell stepped up its battle with Odyssey Partners by raising its offer for Stevens to $67 a share from $62.50. Later in the day, Odyssey boosted its bid to $68.50 from $64. Meanwhile, a Delaware court denied Pepperell's motion to block Odyssey's $64 bid. Pepperell fell 2 1/4 to 34 1/4.    In the over-the-counter market, Farmers Group advanced 2 to 64 7/8. In a letter to B.A.T Industries, the company said that it would meet with B.A.T to see whether B.A.T's Batus subsidiary was willing to increase its $63-a-share offer for Farmers. It also said it was prepared to give Batus confidential information Farmers has made available to others.    Farmers also said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will continue to hold discussions with a third party &quot;to explore the feasibility of a leveraged buy-out of the company.&quot;    Wolverine Technologies surged 4 7/8 to 23 1/4, just above the $23-a-share price being offered by Saint-Gobain, a French firm. The bid tops an earlier offer of $18.50 a share from Ply-Gem Industries, which fell 1 to 13 3/4 in American Stock Exchange trading.    Grolier lost 2 1/2 to 24. The company accepted a sweetened takeover offer of $24.25 a share, or about $450 million, from Hachette S.A. of France.    Media General advanced 1 3/4 to 45 1/8 on the Amex. A federal judge Friday ordered Media General to give documents prepared by its investment banker to Burt Sugarman, who has made a hostile $1.57 billion offer for Media General.    Texas Instruments added 2 1/4 to 52 7/8. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the advance reflected optimism that the company's first-quarter results, due to be released April 21, continued the semiconductor industry's recent trend of better-than-expected earnings. The company declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
