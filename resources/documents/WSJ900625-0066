Following a meeting of the four World War II victors andthe two Germanys here Friday on German unification, there wasa consensus that the merger of the two Germanys has acquireda breakneck momentum, and that despite Moscow's latestfoot-dragging effort, its leverage to block it is decliningrapidly. But the Western allies want to bolster besiegedSoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to allow him to completethe Soviet retreat from Eastern Europe and to carry out aseries of sweeping arms-control reductions while he stillretains domestic political control.</LP><TEXT>   At a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Londonnext month, the allies will focus on reshaping the allianceto make it less threatening militarily to the Soviet Union --a step the Soviets are urging. At a meeting of EuropeanCommunity heads of government in Dublin this week and at nextmonth's economic summit in Houston of the majorindustrialized countries, Western leaders will discusseconomic assistance for the Soviets. And there is optimismabout completing a conventional arms-reduction pact by thisfall, in part because it gives Moscow &quot;some political coverfor withdrawals they are going to have to make in any event,&quot;said a senior American official.   Mr. Gorbachev is facing serious domestic opposition toGerman unification on the West's terms. This pressure adds tothe sharp criticism over his handling of the Soviet economy.Critics on Mr. Gorbachev's political left welcome freedom forthe German people but are concerned that the way unificationis taking place will produce a powerful Germany, according toAnatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, who recently spokeat Lewis and Clark College's law school in Portland, Ore.   But Mr. Sobchak said the real danger to Mr. Gorbachev isfrom the political right and their allies in the military whofear Mr. Gorbachev is giving away their war gains. Last weekat the Russian republic's party congress, Gen. AlbertMakashov, commander of the Volga-Ural military district,complained that &quot;The Soviet army is being driven withoutcombat out of the countries that our fathers liberated fromfascism.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev faces a tough test during a nationalparty congress next month.   The Soviets underscored this pressure during Friday'smeeting here by presenting a unification plan that wouldrequire a continuing presence of occupation forces for aslong as five years following unification. The plan wasopposed by the U.S., France, Britain and West Germany, at themeeting of the four World War II victors and the two Germanys-- known as the &quot;two-plus-four&quot; talks.   U.S. and European officials were quick to tell reportersthat the Soviet hard-line proposal was mainly for Sovietdomestic consumption. Indeed, Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze, in a joint press conference ending thetwo-plus-four meeting, weakened his own proposal by notingthat &quot;the provisions in our draft are not regarded by us asthe final truth. We are ready to seek compromise approaches.&quot;   Nevertheless, one U.S. official who specializes in Sovietaffairs said it is difficult to calculate how much pressurewill be exerted on Mr. Gorbachev to resist Germanunification. The official added that because of the politicalchanges that have taken place in Moscow permitting opencriticism, Mr. Gorbachev himself may not know how far he cango. The official noted that beginning last February, YigorLigachev, a Politburo member who is Mr. Gorbachev's leadingconservative critic, began publicly blaming Mr. Gorbachev for&quot;losing&quot; Eastern Europe.   It is clear in Berlin how quickly Soviet leverage overGerman unification is evaporating. Last Friday's ceremonyremoving Checkpoint Charlie, a well-known crossing pointbetween East and West, symbolized reunification. Severalyards away, providing a symbol of declining Soviet influence,some youthful entrepreneurs were selling Soviet militaryuniforms displayed on hangers attached to a remnant of theBerlin wall.   Events are moving rapidly. German economic unification isset for next week, the Western allies hope German unificationwill be endorsed at a 35-nation conference in late fall andWest German leaders predict that all-German elections willtake place in December.   Resisting this process could be a dangerous game for theSoviets. Moscow sees West Germany as its most importantsource of help for economic rebuilding and trade. Bonn lastweek agreed to guarantee a bank credit for the Sovietstotaling five billion West German marks ($2.98 billion), thelargest ever granted to Moscow by anyone. And this week'sedition of the weekly Der Spiegel says that West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl is planning to present a much largeraid package -- totaling 25 to 30 billion marks -- during avisit to Moscow in late July.   At the same time, the leverage provided by 380,000 Soviettroops in East Germany also is growing weaker. The firstdemonstrations ever against Moscow's troops there, which tookplace earlier this year, underline the danger of theircontinuing presence. Soviet officials also fear the domesticimpact of keeping these troops there long enough to witnessthe bounties of West German capitalism.   &quot;The effect on troops of the Deutsche mark in Germanycould be more dangerous to the Soviet Union than were drugsin Afghanistan,&quot; said a Soviet Foreign Ministry official.   A U.S. official traveling back to Washington from Berlinon Secretary of State James Baker's airplane, concluded that&quot;The leverage the Soviets have, and the only leverage theSoviets have, is to delay sovereignty&quot; by refusing to give uptheir legal rights of occupation. But, the official added, &quot;Ithink they must realize that would not be a particularlyprofitable course for them to follow.&quot;   Ronald Asmas, a Rand Corp. expert on Germany, said, &quot;TheSoviet leverage is currently at its height, but it isdecreasing rapidly.&quot;   But even though Mr. Gorbachev is playing a weak hand, U.S.officials believe it is important to bolster him. Ironically,the ultimate leverage he may have is the chaos and dangerthat would ensue if the Soviet Union were to collapse. Afterinitially resisting providing economic assistance to Moscow,the Bush administration now is prepared to reluctantly goalong. The Houston economic summit &quot;will begin the process ofdiscussing that issue in international forums,&quot; said theofficial on Mr. Baker's aircraft.   In the West, there is a degree of understanding andtolerance for Moscow's problems. &quot;I've told my Americanfriends that we have to avoid turning two-plus-four intofive-against-one,&quot; said Karsten Voight, a Social Democratmember of West Germany's Parliament and a security expert.   At Friday's two-plus-four news conference, when Mr.Shevardnadze was questioned sharply about his new proposalfor unification, he asserted that Moscow wasn't rejecting theconsensus views of the Western allies. Rather, he said, &quot;Weadd something to them.&quot; His answer produced a good-naturedlaugh from Mr. Baker, who admires a facile response by apolitician who is fighting an uphill battle.   ---   Timothy Aeppel in Bonn contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
