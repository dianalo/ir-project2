Green resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Connecticut Bancorp, the holding company of Norwalk Bank.    A spokesman for the company said Mr. Green's decision to resign was due to differences over how quickly and in what manner a planned expansion of the company should occur.    Mr. Green, 56 years old, who has served as chairman, president and chief executive since the company was formed in April 1986, couldn't be reached for comment.    Frank J. Cooke, 67, a former mayor of Norwalk and a member of the boards of the holding company and the bank, has been named interim chairman. Mr. Green will retain his seat on the board of the holding company. </TEXT></DOC>
