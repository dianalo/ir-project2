The market is dominated by the InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organization, or Intelsat, aconsortium of 121 member countries. Communications SatelliteCorp., or Comsat, is the U.S. signatory, holding 25% of theworld-wide monopoly.</LP><TEXT>   The agency voted 5-0 to permit so-called separatesatellite systems such as Pan American Satellite, Greenwich,Conn., to offer private telephone line services connected topublic phone networks. The separate systems can also provideprivate-line, video and audio transmission services thataren't connected to public phone networks.   In addition, the FCC will allow Intelsat's competitors toprovide emergency services to restore communications linksthat use public phone networks.   The policy changes are effective immediately. The agency'saction followed a decision last November by the State andCommerce departments to end all restrictions on separatesatellite systems by 1997. The decision came in response to apetition from PanAmSat, a private company that has launchedits own satellite and now serves the U.S., Europe, LatinAmerica and the Caribbean.   PanAmSat applauded the agency for dispatching the decisionwithout a lengthy proceeding. The company &quot;can now implementa wider range of innovative services to our customers&quot; saidPanAmSat President Fred Landman.   To prepare for full competition to Intelsat, PanAmSatannounced plans last year to launch three more satellitesbeginning in 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
