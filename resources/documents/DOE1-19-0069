The preparationobtained with the DMSO treatment appeared to contain a larger fractionof large and highly charged polynuclear complexes than the preparationwithout the DMSO treatment. According to experiments by other investigatorsthe smaller sup(99m)Tc(Sn)EHDP complexes (early eluting components inIPC) give lower bone/blood ratios than the larger ones. The results presentedin this paper show that the explanation for the effect of the DMSO treatmentmay be that the Sn-EHDP complexes which are removed by extraction withDMSO, give relatively small sup(99m)Tc(Sn)EHDP complexes. Without thesesmall complexes a superior bone scan agent is obtained. From experimentsin which an excess of {sup 99}TcO{sub 4} over Sn(II) was used, it wasconcluded that at least one of the technetium complexes contains Sn(IV).On the other hand, the absence of Sn from a late eluting technetium complexwas proven.</TEXT></DOC>
