There would be a shortage and higher prices in the U.S., but there would be a surplus in other Western nations, said delegates at a conference held by the Uranium Institute, an international industry association of producers and consumers.    Uncertain about the ban, utilities already have pushed prices of U.S.-mined uranium to a $2 premium over international spot quotes of $16.75 a pound, dealers say.    &quot;The situation is the most complex industry problem that I have yet encountered,' said George White, a vice president at Nuexco, a uranium brokerage concern based in Menlo Park, Calif.    Any ban, Mr. White said, could create such an acute shortage in the U.S. that prices of uranium oxide could &quot;quite possibly surge to $25, even $30 a pound in only a few months.&quot;    In July, a federal appeals court barred the Department of Energy from processing foreign uranium. The decision, which upheld a lower court order, said Congress intended the department not to process any imported uranium &quot;until the domestic industry is rejuvinated and becomes viable.&quot;    The suit had been brought by several domestic producers in early 1985, seeking to force the department to restrict uranium imports. The litigation was based on a section of the Atomic Energy Act that requires the government to ensure the health of the U.S. uranium industry.    The Energy Department concluded in 1985 that the industry wasn't in good shape, but it refused to restrict imports, arguing that to do so would exacerbate trade tensions with major trade partners such as Canada, and would drive nuclear power plant operators abroad for uranium enrichment.    On Friday, an Energy Department spokesman said the department plans to appeal to the Supreme Court but hasn't yet filed the papers. In the meantime, the spokesman said, the ban hasn't been enforced.    If the Supreme Court agrees with the decision, a ban on most or all foreign uranium oxide could come into force, delegates said. But it's uncertain whether previous contracts would be affected, delegates said.    Either way, U.S. producers would gain at the expense of leading producing nations, notably Canada and Australia, delegates said. Foreign producers have provided about 40% of all the uranium the government processes, the Energy Department said.    Annual U.S. uranium production has slumped from 43 million pounds in 1980 to a third of that this year. Since annual U.S. consumption is 39 million pounds, Nuexco said, utilities and other users either reduced stocks or filled surplus needs in Canada, Australia and elswhere.    If a ban did come into force, current Western production outside the U.S. would exceed demand about 8%, Mr. White said. Theoretically, world prices should fall. But in practice, he said, the ban could be less than 100% and consumers may decide to stop running down stocks and buy more uranium from producers.    U.S. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions, analysts say. Uranium from South Africa, for example, has already fallen under anti-apartheid sanctions. But last year, said the Uranium Institute, U.S. imports of South African uranium surged 300% to more than 13.2 million pounds. Almost 60% of the deliveries took place in December 1986, the last month before the embargo took effect.    Meanwhile, international uranium prices are beginning to revive.    After soaring from $6 a pound in 1973 to a peak of $43.40 in 1978, spot uranium prices tumbled to a low of $14.45 in 1985. Prices then recovered and stabilized around $17 a pound for a year.    Even without U.S. protectionism, total Western operating and planned production capacity from 1989 onward will be insufficient to meet expected uranium demand, said the Uranium Institute's supply and demand committee.    Stricter safety standards following the Chernobyl accident will delay construction of nuclear reactors, they say. Yet there will still be sufficient orders to raise demand for uranium in the next 10 years.    Demand for enriched uranium will rise to 48,500 metric tons by the year 2000 from 41,700 metric tons in 1987, the institute predicts. Annual Western output of refined uranium, on the other hand, fell from 44,000 tons in 1980 to 34,700 metric tons in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
