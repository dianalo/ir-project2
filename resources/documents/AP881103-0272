The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, rose 31 cents Wednesday to close at $13.75 per barrel.On Tuesday, the December contract slipped 14 cents.   Prices for refined products traded on the exchange also advanced.   The December contract for wholesale heating oil rose 0.18 cent agallon to settle at 43.35 cents, while the December contract forunleaded gasoline rose 0.17 cent to 43.79 cents a gallon.   Andrew Lebow, a trader with E.D.andamp;F. Man International FuturesInc., said crude oil prices improved in response to an AmericanPetroleum Institute report that stocks of crude had declined.   A Wall Street Journal story that crude production by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped to 23 millionbarrels a day last week had no effect on trading, Lebow said.   In recent weeks, reports of stepped-up production by the13-nation cartel has depressed prices, and traders were surprisedthat Wednesday's story did not send prices lower.   ``I think people really don't know what's fundamentally goingon,'' Lebow said.   He attributed Wednesday's price movements mainly to technicalfactors, but said strong demand helped push gasoline and heatingprices higher.</TEXT></DOC>
