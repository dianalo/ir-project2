Courtney; a full two-thirds are traced backto honest mistakes by users or programmers.andM;Water damage, storms, fire, and power interruptions account for another 13per cent -- just as much as dishonest employees who hope their actions willnever come to light.andP;  Disgrungled employees add six per cent, with a twist:acting cut of revenge, they want their destructive efforts to be noticed.andM;&quot;Security is, first and foremost, a people problem,&quot; Courtney concluded, &quot;andmost people will be more careful and more honest if they think they're likelyto be caught.&quot;andM;Knowing these facts can help system administrators find a good balancebetween accessability and control.andP;  &quot;All kinds of things sound like reallygreat ideas,&quot; cautioned Parker, &quot;but you have to think like the enemy, thecriminal, the incompetent, to see, whether these will be effective.&quot;andM;He numbers dial-back modems and encryption devices among the once-popularproducts that are seldom installed today.andM;Dial-back modems have been largely undermined by call forwarding a phonenumber provides no fix on an intruder's actual location.andM;And most encryption devices just plug a small rathole -- the slightpossibility of someone eavesdropping on telecommunications -- while the barndoor may still be wide open.andP;  If dishonest employees or intruders can simplysign onto young system, they'll never bother acquiring the skill andequipment to snoop into telecommunication links.andM;In any gathering of computer security experts, you can expect to hear a fewjuicy anecdotes.andP;  Did you know that if American Express's central computergoes down even for an hour, there's a noticeable spurt in credit card fraud?andO;Or that Allstate Insurance lost $1 million (U.S.) worth of IBM, ATs to a SanFrancisco burglary ring?andP;  That an automaker in England had to send midgetscrawling through its ventilation systems to reopen vents closed when thepower went down?andM;&quot;The list of unfortunate things that can happens is endless,&quot; said Courtney.andO;Computer hazard lists have been known to include meteorites, tornados, andcosmic rays.andM;Parker said the basic principle of &quot;moving threats away from assets, andmoving assets away from threats&quot; applies to many situations.andP;  Single-usepasswords and various types of &quot;tokens&quot; carried by the user are the latestinnovations in computer security.andP;  But don't try to justify security costs byestimating how vulnerable you are, he advised, because &quot;comprehensive,quantified risk analysts has been a total failure.&quot;andM;Since no one can predict human behavior, no one can tell exactly howvulnerable any system is.andP;  Instead, he recommends the non-alarmist view that&quot;business is risk-taking, and if a manager decides he'd sooner spend themoney on something other than security, that's perfectly all right -- as longas you've made him aware of the risks.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
