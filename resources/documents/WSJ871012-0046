The Canadian Union of Postal Workers said it called the nationwide strike to protest the legislation. The bill was introduced last week after contract negotiations broke down between the 23,000-member union and Canada Post Corp., the government-owned postal agency.    Debate on the bill, which may result in an arbitrated settlement if it is passed into law, began Friday in the House of Commons. The opposition Liberal and New Democratic Parties blocked its immediate passage because they are seeking to make amendments. Parliament isn't scheduled to sit again before tomorrow.    Should the bill become law, union officers who defied it would face stiff fines and would be barred from holding union office for five years.    A Canada Post spokesman said that mail was moving in most regions of the country, but that temporary workers weren't able to get through picket lines in Vancouver, British Columbia, and at the main sorting station in Toronto, where the agency used helicopters to move some mail. </TEXT></DOC>
