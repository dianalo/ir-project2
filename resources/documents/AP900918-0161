President Fernando Collor de Mello, acompanied by his threemilitary ministers, tossed a handful of dirt into a1,000-foot-deep, concrete- and steel-lined hole that officials saidwas constructed 10 years ago to test bombs. It was never used.   ``The hole was adequate for an eventual nuclear test, but thiswill not occur in the Brazil of President Collor de Mello,'' saidspokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva.   The hole on the Serra do Cachimbo Air Force Base, 930 milesnorthwest of Brasilia, was excavated in 1979 when Brazil was ruledby its last military president, Gen. Joao Figueredo. Its existencewas a secret until four years ago. Even then, base officialsclaimed it was used for testing equipment for a Brazilian spaceprogram.   Rosa e Silva said the hole was secretly constructed by theNational Security Council, a military agency that has since beendisbanded.   Civilians took the reins of government in 1985 but fulldemocracy was not restored until last December's election victoryby Collor.   The spokesman said Collor confirmed the existence of the holelast week and decided to go personally to the site to ``signal hisposition against secret military adventures.''   In 1987, Brazil developed the means to enrich uranium, a crucialstep towards the construction of nuclear bombs, and the country nowhas the capacity to make such weapons, according to the BrazilianSociety of Physics.   Historically, the country's nuclear development programs havebeen under control of separate branches of the armed forces,independent of civilian control.   Brazil has refused to sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty and as a result its nuclear program is not monitored by theInternational Agency of Atomic Energy.   Brazilian officials say the treaty is discriminatory because itdiscourages the transfer of nuclear technology to developingcountries.   Last week, Brazil and Argentina - the only two Latin Americancountries that possess nuclear know-how - released a statementpromising not to utilize their knowledge to produce atomic wepaons.</TEXT></DOC>
