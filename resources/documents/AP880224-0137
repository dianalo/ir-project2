Daily Times on President Reagan's budget:   President Reagan has submitted a $1.1 trillion federal budget toCongress for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.   Reagan campaigned for the presidency eight years ago with apromise to ``balance the federal budget.''   He has failed to provide the kind of leadership that wouldencourage Congress to act in a fiscally responsible fashion.   As a result, we can expect annual budgets of more than $1trillion and continued growth of the national debt, now somewherearound $2.5 trillion.   To the millions of taxpayers who had looked to Reagan to clampdown on the big spenders in Washington, his two terms in the WhiteHouse have been a dismal failure.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 16   Medford (Ore.) Mail Tribune on Pat Robertson:   Voters shouldn't be shamed into supporting Pat Robertson'scandidacy for president.   He contends religious bias has dogged his campaign, ...comparing his trials with the anti-Catholic forces that JohnKennedy had to deal with. ...   William Manchester, in ``The Making of the President 1960,''noted that Kennedy turned the bias issue so that a vote for Kennedysignified religious tolerance, while a vote for Hubert Humphrey,his principal rival in the primaries, proved nothing of the sort.   That's what Robertson is attempting to do. ...   Robertson isn't dogged by any issue of religious bias he hasn'tmanufactured.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 18   The Jackson (Tenn.) Sun on Richard Gephardt:   U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt headed South after the New Hampshireprimary as one of two frontrunners in an uncertain Democraticpresidential campaign.   Gephardt's campaign, however, hardly sounded presidential afteran Iowa caucus victory and a second place in the nation's firstprimary.   His campaign manager, William Carrick, didn't make his bosssound like much of a frontrunner.   Among other things, Carrick called U.S. Sen. Albert Gore and hispresidential campaign staff ``two-bit bastards,'' followed by``meddlesome bastards.'' ...   Only after several days did Carrick apologize for the remarks.   Gore and his camp took the unintended compliment with goodgrace, refusing to engage in a name-calling match. ...   Apparently, Gephardt's campaign manager thinks Gore is someoneto worry about. If so, he's right.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 17   Reading (Pa.) Eagle on Social Security:   Is Social Security strictly a retirement account, or is it anannuity that takes effect when a participant reaches age 65 and iseligible for full benefits, or reaches age 62 and is eligible forreduced benefits?   That's the argument that has flared in Washington once again asthe effort is launched to eliminate the $8,400 a year earnings cap.   Those who support the proposal ... argue that (the cap) punishesthe elderly.   Critics insist the original intent of Social Security was toprovide income after retirement. They tread on uncertain grounds,however, when they bring up the matter of the original intent ofSocial Security.   Original intent ... was changed in a wholesale manner by ...revisions: A notable example of that is that widows of farmers whonever paid Social Security taxes were granted benefits.   Also, ... the earnings cap ends at age 70. If earnings are afactor between the ages of 65 and 70, why not after 70?   Repeal of the earnings cap is clearly in the public interest.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 19   The Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune on violence in Israeli-occupiedareas:   At first it seemed too reprehensible to be true. At thisdistance from Israel, Americans couldn't know for certain whetherto believe a report that Israeli soldiers had severely beaten fourPalestinian youths and then buried them alive using a bulldozer.   The allegation, it turns out, is fact.   The youths, who were dug out by villagers after the soldiersleft the scene in the West Bank village of Kfar Salem, allsurivived. ... The youths were being ``punished'' for participatingin disturbances.   Even Israelis who have supported the government's policy of``force, might and beatings'' to quell Palestinian unrest in theoccupied territories were stunned by the news reports on theincident. ...   Israel is going to have to make a choice. It will have to choosebetween continuing an indefensible policy of repression in theoccupied areas, or taking steps to address the legitimategrievances of more than 500,000 Palestinians living under Israelicontrol.   Israel's future as a nation of democratic ideals depends on theoutcome.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
