Indeed, one source reports that when Mr. Reagan and former President Nixon commiserated together on the telephone recently, the current president expressed his irritation that his supporters had fled.    Mr. Reagan's Iran crisis isn't likely to lead as far as Mr. Nixon's Watergate did -- to the resignation of the president -- yet it has left Mr. Reagan more isolated than anyone might have imagined just a few months ago. While Richard Nixon had his supporters to the bitter end, Mr. Reagan, the most popular president in decades, has been left virtually alone since the flap began last month.    &quot;The whole damn pack has headed for the tall grass,&quot; White House communications director Patrick Buchanan charged in an article this week in the Washington Post. He lambasted the Republican Party establishment, which he says &quot;owes all it has and all it is to Ronald Wilson Reagan.&quot; Republican Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf says the lack of support &quot;is disappointing in some ways, but by the same token, there are an awful lot of people who feel that until the facts are out, it is a little difficult for some of them to take a position.&quot;    While Mr. Nixon, South Carolina's Sen. Strom Thurmond, Alaska's Sen. Ted Stevens and a few others are now starting to defend the president, there are clear reasons why so few have stepped forward:    --Unlike Watergate, which many Republicans and conservatives at first viewed as a trumped-up and partisan battle, this dispute is over a policy that deeply troubles Mr. Reagan's constituency. Conservatives are shocked that Mr. Reagan, admired for his strong anti-terrorist stance, secretly violated his own policy. &quot;When someone says, 'But he was giving arms to people he knew had killed our Marines,' it's hard to respond to that,&quot; says conservative Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.).    --Administration officials seem more intent on protecting their own reputations than in helping Mr. Reagan. &quot;It turned out it was darned dangerous to defend the president because you didn't know which administration official was going to come out and dump on the policy tomorrow, or what was going to come out,&quot; says Rep. Dick Cheney (R., Wyo.), one of the few House Republican leaders who vocally gave the president the benefit of the doubt during the early days of the crisis.    --The White House staff, exhausted and disappointed by the recent elections, failed to get out and mobilize support the way the Nixon staff did. John Ehrlichman, who was one of Mr. Nixon's top aides during the Watergate affair, says he was amazed last week when a White House aide told him that there wasn't any organized effort to whip up support. Says Mr. Ehrlichman: &quot;These things don't just happen. People in the White House have to cause them to happen.&quot;    --Members of Congress are upset because Mr. Reagan's secret Iran-Nicaragua arms policy violated their turf. In addition, his lame-duck status makes it easier for politicians to distance themselves from him.    --Mr. Reagan's own distance from the probe has hampered his credibility, analysts believe. Even though he personally disclosed the diversion of funds to the Contra rebels and endorsed appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the matter, the president hasn't effectively taken charge of the crisis by getting to the bottom of it himself and laying it out for the public, they say.    &quot;They seem to be dying by inches. The stuff is dribbling out,&quot; says Mr. Ehrlichman. &quot;It's the normal tendency of the White House staff to think he should be presidential, don't overexpose him. We proved 13 years ago that that approach doesn't work.&quot;    Even the Rev. Jerry Falwell, the outspoken founder of the Moral Majority and a staunch supporter of Mr. Reagan in the past, has kept a low profile this time. &quot;Until we know a lot more, I don't think it would be wise for him or anyone else to make big statements,&quot; explains his spokesman, Mark DeMoss.    At the heart of the problem is the fact that Mr. Reagan was dealing with Iran -- a nation that Americans watched abusing U.S. hostages and trampling the flag. &quot;A lot of members found the whole notion sort of incredible from the outset,&quot; says Mr. Cheney, who was chief of staff for President Ford. &quot;Why would you ever want to sell arms to the Iranians?&quot;    Eddie Mahe, a Republican campaign consultant, puts it even more bluntly: &quot;I can't think of a single politician who'd be dumb enough to want to support anything that had anything to do with Iran.&quot;    While Republican officials owe Mr. Reagan a great deal for revitalizing their party, they aren't as afraid now as they were a year ago to stand apart from him. His formidable popularity failed to produce political clout in the Nov. 4 elections, and the loss of Republican control of the Senate has cast doubts on his future effectiveness.    &quot;Ronald Reagan has converted himself from a lame duck to a capon,&quot; says Conservative Caucus chairman Howard Phillips. &quot;As far as conservatives are concerned, the Reagan administration is essentially dead.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
