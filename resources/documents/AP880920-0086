Arab officials and newspapers called Monday's launch a ``spysatellite'' and said the craft would be used for military purposesand would threaten the entire Arab world.   The launching of a three-stage rocket carrying the grayHorizon-1 satellite made Israel only the eighth nation to place asatellite in space.   ``There are few countries in the world capable of doing this andthe citizens of Israel can be proud of their country,'' PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel radio.   In Washington, Arab League representative Clovis Maksoud voicedconcern over the launch, saying the satellite gave Israel ``aserious strategic leverage'' since the country already had thecapability to fire long-range missiles.   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in London, described thecraft as a ``spy satellite (and part of a) psychological war beingcarried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.''   Tishrin, a Syrian government newspaper whose editorialsgenerally reflect official stands, also called the craft a ``spysatellite'' and predicted it would be used for military purposes.   ``The U.S. commitment to expand Israel's military power is apermanent source of danger and tension in the Middle East,''Tishrin added.   Syria is Israel's main enemy in the Middle East.   In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, radio stations reported the launchingwith no comment. The Soviet media ignored the story, and Israelradio quoted a Jordanian official as saying the satelliteapparently had military uses.   Both Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres dismissed fearsthat the satellite would spur an arms race with Arab countries.   ``The Arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will doanything they can anyway,'' Peres said on the radio.   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's space agency, said the satellitewould remain in orbit for about a month before disintegrating.   Development of the Horizon-1 was the result of more than 20years of Israeli space research and was part of the country'seffort to become independent in the defense field.   Until now, Israel has relied on the United States to providesatellite pictures, but some officials have complained the U.S. wasstingy in supplying intelligence information.   In March 1987, former U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard wassentenced to life in prison for selling Israel hundreds of U.S.military documents.   Israeli media have quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as saying thedocuments Pollard delivered included satellite pictures of Iraqiand Syrian weapons and storage facilities.   ``If you are fed from the crumbs of others according to theirwhims, this is very inconvenient and very difficult,'' said MeirAmit, a former head of Israel's Mossad secret service and now chiefof the General Satellite Corp., a communications satellitesproducer.   A possible source of concern to Israel is the news that SaudiArabia is deploying Chinese-built CSS-2 missiles about 285 milessouth of Riyad.   Satellite photographs displayed by Space Media Network, aprivate Swedish firm, showed the Saudis were expanding an airstripand a military complex to accommodate the new weapons.   The Israeli satellite weighs about 340 pounds and is believed tobe carrying a 6.6-pound payload for surveillance usage, apparentlyfor monitoring activity in Arab countries, according to a spokesmanfor Jane's Defense Weekly, the London-based defense magazine.   Tony Banks, a Jane's reporter with close ties to Israelimilitary sources, said Israel was not believed to have thecapability of installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in asatellite.   ``U.S. optical equipment is assumed to have been used in thepayload,'' Banks told The Associated Press in London.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the UnitedStates was not involved with the Israeli program.   Pentagon officials said they were unsure exactly what was in thesatellite's payload. One source said on condition of anonymity that``we're leaning toward more of an experimental communicationspackage as opposed to a true spy satellite.''   Foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craftthat would precede the launching of a spy satellite. Neeman said asecond satellite was already under development and would be used tocarry out scientific tests.</TEXT></DOC>
