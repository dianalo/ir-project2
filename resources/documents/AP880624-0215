ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush, citing Michael Dukakis' support for$115 million in state tax increases, said Friday the differencebetween him and the Democratic governor was ``tax cuts versus taxhikes.'' Dukakis said New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley has takenhimself out of consideration for the vice presidential nomination.   ``I respect that,'' Dukakis told reporters as he began a briefvacation.   Jesse Jackson dismissed a published report he had told aidesthat he would not accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.   ``Whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was notdealing in the truth,'' said Jackson.   The former civil rights leader said Thursday he had decidedwhether or not to accept the vice presidential nomination, but herefused to disclose his decision. The Boston Globe reported Fridaythat Jackson had told aides he wasn't interested in the vicepresidency.   Jackson denied the report during a visit to Puerto Rico where hepicked up six of the state's 57 Democratic convention delegates.Previously, the entire delegation had been committed to supportDukakis at the July Democratic National Convention.   Talking to reporters at a Republican unity meeting inCincinnati, Bush cited Dukakis' announcement on Thursday that hesupports a $115 million tax package that included a $40 millionlevy on ciagrettes as part of an effort to deal with a $200 millionstate budget shortfall.   ``I will not raise your taxes, period,'' said the vicepresident. ``He just has in his home state.''   Bush added that ``I'm just pointing out a fundamental differencethat I have on the federal level in terms of what the governorhimself has said. It makes me wonder what his commitment is.''   Bush told reporters that their views on taxes was a ``plain asday'' difference between himself and Dukakis. He said thatdifference was ``tax cuts versus tax hikes.''   The Massachusetts tax increases offered a welcome target toRepublicans eager to knock down the lead Dukakis has enjoyed inrecent national polls.   GOP Senate Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was scheuled to address aparty meeting in Ohio on Saturday and his office released thefollowing excerpt:   ``George Bush has made it clear that he will not raise taxes,period. And what about Mike Dukakis? Ask the people ofMassachusetts. Yesterday, they got some more bad news from theirgovernor _ he's at it again. He just announced $110 million in newtaxes for the people of Tax-achusetts.''   The revenue shortfall in Massachusetts is common to other statesas well and is a result in part of the changes in federal tax lawsenacted in 1986.   Bush was asked why he was not equally critical of Republicanally Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, who has also proposed a taxincrease to help balance his state budget.   ``Dukakis is running for president of the United States. JimThompson is not,'' said Bush.   The vice president also said he was confident he would overcomethe so-called gender gap, the indication in polls that women voterssupport Dukakis by a far higher percentage than do men.   ``I am confident we can overcome this gender gap,'' said Bush.``I want to be sure I'm as sensitive as possible to the concerns ofthese activist women in our party. I think we've got a good messagefor women.''   Dukakis said Bradley had told the campaign he wasn't interestedin the vice presidency.   ``In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' said theMassachusetts governor, who was vacationing on Nantucket, an islandoff the coast of Massachusetts.   At his side was his wife, Kitty, who underwent spinal surgerythree weeks ago.   ``Want to see my scar?'' she said, removing the neck brace shehas worn since the operation.   Meanwhile, Democratic Party platform writers worked in Coloradoon what was shaping up as the shortest party platform in half acentury, a document calling for restoration of ``competence andhope'' and avoiding talk of higher taxes, a Pentagon spendingfreeze or a Palestinian homeland.   Those three issues could be the subject of convention fightsbetween supporters of Dukakis and Jackson, though Jackson partisanEleanor Holmes Norton said ``I'm not expecting any battles. We'retrying to work out things that could cause great difficulties.''   In other political news:   _The latest figures from the Federal Election Commission show acontinuing slump in Republican fund-raising, although the GOP stillleads the Democrats.   The FEC summary of 15-month totals through March 31 showedRepublican committees had raised $97 million, compared to $127million at the same point in 1986, $137 million in 1984 and $116million in 1982. The Democrats have raised a total of $29 millionin this cycle, compared to $24 million in 1986, $37 million in1984, and $13 million in 1982.   _Sen. John Glenn of Ohio got a boost as Democratic vicepresidential nominee from Republican Party chairman Frank J.Fahrenkopf Jr. At the Cincinnati GOP meeting, Fahrenkopf saidGlenn's presence on the Democratic ticket would make the GOP's jobmore difficult in November.   ``He is a national hero,'' the GOP chairman said of Glenn, theformer astronaut who was the first American to orbit Earth.``People take a lot of pride in that and it can transcend partyaffiliations.''</TEXT></DOC>
