United, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Inc., paid for the Frontier assets during its unsuccessful bid to acquire the carrier from Newark, N.J.-based People Express in July. But after receiving United's payment for the gates, Frontier filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection, and the transfer of the properties was never completed.    Subsequently, Texas Air agreed to buy People Express, and in the process acquired control of the Frontier gates that United had paid for. In December, a federal judge ruled that Denver-based Frontier, as an indirect unit of Texas Air, could maintain control of the gates and hangars that United had paid for until the issue could be fully adjudicated as part of Frontier's Chapter 11 case.    Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.    Texas Air said that it had agreed to resolve the entire matter by paying $55 million to Frontier -- its own subsidiary -- $40 million of which would be used to reimburse United. In Chicago, a United spokesman wouldn't elaborate on details of the transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
