The adoption ofthat amendment secured for women an equal voice in our representative systemby guaranteeing their right to vote. Its ratification in 1920 marked awatershed in American history by ensuring that women, equally with men,could enjoy fully the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The active role of women during World War I was one important factorin gathering the force of public opinion behind the women's suffrage movement.Women already had the vote in some States, but during the war, as theybecame essential workers in many industries, women gained increasing voiceand stature throughtout the country. Thus, after years of hard work andpersistent lobbying by women's rights groups, the Congress passed the 19thAmendment in June 1919. It was finally ratified by the Tennessee legislatureon August 18, 1920, and proclaimed as part of our Constitution on August26.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">By securing for women the right to vote_and allowing them full participationin the political life of our country_the 19th Amendment affirmed the principlesupon which our Nation was founded. In essence, it called us to remain faithfulto the vision of our Founders, who had pledged their lives and fortunesto defending the belief ``that all men are created equal, that they areendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among theseare Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.'' The ratification ofthe 19th Amendment was a poignant reminder that the civil and politicalrights enshrined in our Constitution are the birthright of all.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">By recognizing previously disenfranchised members of our society,the 19th Amendment took a place among other great landmarks in Americanhistory, such as President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. These legal milestones, and others thathave since followed, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, have marked ourNation's progress in ensuring that all members of our society have theopportunity to reach their full potential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recent years, women have continued their remarkable achievementsin virtually every field of endeavor, gaining positions of leadership ingovernment, education, business, medicine, and the arts. During our Nation'srecord peacetime economic expansion these past 80 months, 53 percent ofthe increase in employment has been among women; the wage gap has beenclosing; and today, increasing numbers of women are obtaining undergraduateand professional degrees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">On this 69th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, it is appropriatethat we recognize the many accomplishments of women, as well as their uniquerole in keeping our families, communities, and Nation strong. But todaylet us also renew our commitment to protecting the rights of all Americans,so that the United States might truly be a land of ``liberty and justicefor all.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1989, as Women'sEquality Day_a day to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the ratificationof the 19th Amendment.

Some 80 percent of these crashesinvolve a legally intoxicated driver or pedestrain. During 1988 alone,alcohol played a role in more than 23,000 traffic deaths. The personallosses and suffering of the thousands injured by drunk driving and of thosewhose loved ones are killed in alcohol-related crashes are inestimable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Drugs other than alcohol also pose a significant threat to our highwaysafety. Studies show that certain drugs_legal as well as illegal, and eitheralone or in combination with alcohol_contribute to highway crashes. Allof us should be aware of the safety risks of driving after taking prescribedmedications or over-the-counter drugs_especially those that have labelswarning against operating a motor vehicle. We should also be mindful thatcombining drugs and alcohol increases those safety risks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Two years ago, a coalition headed by Mothers Against Drunk Drivingsponsored the first National Drive for Life Day and  campaigned for allAmericans to pledge not to drink and drive on that day. By pausing on NationalDrive for Life Day to demonstrate their commitment to the fight againstdrunk driving, Americans underscored the importance of keeping that pledgethroughout the year. The successof that first day prompted calls for anexpanded campaign, to which the Congress responded in 1988 by designatingLabor Day weekend as National Drive for Life Weekend. By Senate Joint Resolution127, the Congress has again called for a national campaign by designatingthe Labor Day weekend beginning September 2, 1989, as ``National Drivefor Life Weekend'' and has authorized and requested the President to issuea proclamation in observance of this weekend.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerican, do hereby proclaim the Labor Day weekend, September 2 through4, 1989, as National Drive for Life Weekend.

They are a fitting tribute to our Flag. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Flag is the unique symbol of our Republic and the freedom thatwe cherish.

Thus, in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, theygave the Congress the power ``To promote the Progress of Science and usefulArts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusiveRight to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Under this provision,the Federal Government can encourage the work of authors and inventorsby protecting their right to reap the fruits of their labor.     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In his first Annual Message to the Congress, President George Washingtonreminded its members of the importance of progress in science and the arts,proclaiming that ``there is nothing which can better deserve your patronagethan the promotion of science and literature.'' Less than 6 months later,the Congress passed two landmark laws: the first Patent Act, which PresidentWashington signed on April 10, 1790, and the first Copyright Act, whichhe signed on May 31, 1790. These two Acts have played an important rolein establishing the United States as an economic and cultural leader amongnations.       </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">During the past 200 years, our Nation's patent and copyright lawshave, as Abraham Lincoln once observed, ``added the fuel of interest tothe fire of genius.'' American inventors have left their mark on industryand everyday life, and the world's history books include their names alongsidethose of other great pioneers. Our standard of living, which is in partthe result of American technology and innovation, has long been the highestin the world.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Advances in technology have also produced new forms of authorship,and we have expanded our copyright laws accordingly. Copyright protectionnow covers such works as photographs, phonograms, motion pictures, andcomputer programs. These changes have enabled fledging enterprises to becomeenduring industries. The success of new industries has, in turn, givenaspiring authors, inventors, and artists greater faith in their dreamsand further incentive to share the fruits of their talents with others. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As our patent and copyright laws enter their 3rd century, it is fittingthat we recognize the role they have played in the scientific, economic,and cultural development of our Nation. On this occasion, it is also fittingthat we encourage America's young people to follow in the footsteps ofthe many inventors and artists who have enriched our lives with their visionand creativity.     </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In recognition of the importance of the patent and copyright lawsto the United States, the Congress, by Public Law 99-523, has authorizedand requested the President to issue a proclamation commemorating the bicentennialanniversary of the first patent and copyright laws.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to fosterrecognition of the importance of our patent and copyright systems throughappropriate educational and cultural programs and activities during 1990,the bicentennial year of our Nation's first patent and copyright laws.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth dayof August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, andof the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred andfourteenth.   <ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 89-19634  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 8-16-89; 2:31 pm]  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing Code 3195-01-M   <FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="90"><T4>Federal Register</T4> / Vol. 54, No. 159 / Friday, August 18, 1989/ Presidential Documents<ITAG tagnum="40">Executive Order 12687 of August 15, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">President's Education Policy Advisory Committee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution andlaws of the United States of America, and in order to establish, in accordancewith the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5U.S.C.
