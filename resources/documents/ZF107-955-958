GrossmanandM;NeXT Inc.'s NeXT Computer System, now being shipped with a fully functionaloperating system and about 20 bundled academic and programming applications,stands out from the growing pack of Unix workstations when it comes to easeof use, but lags when it comes to the availability of business applications.andM;What the system offers -- a slick user interface, sophisticated sound andgraphics, an impressive array of bundled software, a large,1,120-by-832-pixel display and a 256M-byte read/write optical-disk drive --provides a new level of applications integration and features.andM;In PC Week's tests, PostScript graphics were cut out of one application andpasted seamlessly into another; speech was appended to an E-mail message; andquotations were searched for from the bundled database and merged into aNeXT-compatible word processor.andP;  The look and feel of all programs isremarkably similar because of the common user-interface tool kit that allNeXT applications developers are using.andM;The bundled word processor, WriteNow, is powerful and offerswhat-you-see-is-what-you-get text and graphics.andP;  However, it was slow whenscrolling through long documents, and lacked support for word-processorformats other than ASCII and Rich Text Format (RTF).andM;The 68030-based NeXT computer may win over some Unix workstation usersunhappy with the cryptic command syntax of the operating system.andP;  NeXT hasadded a graphical interface to Unix, which simplifies network configurationand support.andM;The graphical tools, designed primarily for connecting NeXT machines, alsosimplified the process of linking the NeXT to PC Week's test machines -- anIBM PS/2 Model 50Z and a Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  VAX -- via NeXT's built-inEthernet adapter.andM;The system PC Week tested included a 660M-byte hard-disk drive, 16M bytes ofRAM and the NeXT 400-dot-per-inch PostScript laser printer.andP;  This systemcosts $23,075.andP;  NeXT's base configuration, with 8M bytes of memory and the256M-byte optical-disk drive, retails for $9,995.andM;The lack of a floppy drive makes it problematic to move Macintosh, PC or evenNeXT programs into the computer.andP;  For PC Week's tests, transferring filesbetween the NeXT and the PS/2 was done by running Sun Microsystems Inc.'sPC-NFS software on the PS/2; the machines were connected via the Ethernetadapter.andP;  File transfer via a direct serial line is possible, but requiresadditional software.andM;Using the NeXT's Digital Librarian software, which comes bundled with themachine, PC Week was able to quickly perform full-text searches on a PC Weekdatabase of 6,000 articles.andP;  The software was unable to search on key wordsthat use slashes, however, such as &quot;OS/2.&quot;andM;The documentation supplied with the system (much of which can be searchedon-line) is useful for those who are interested in doing things the NeXT way.andO;It describes how to connect NeXT hardware and to network with other NeXTcomputers.andP;  But try hooking up an external Small Computer System Interface(SCSI) device such as a scanner, and the only help offered by the on-linedocumentation is a reference to a manual that hasn't been printed yet.andM;The NeXT computer is an exciting system to work with, but the lack ofapplications software, the absence of support from third-party peripheralsvendors and the incompleteness of the documentation make it a difficultmachine on which to get work done.andP;  As this changes, the system could viewith the Macintosh and Sun's SPARCstation as a powerful corporate or academicworkstation, but it still has a long way to go.andM;NeXT Inc., of Redwood City, Calif., can be reached at (415) 424-8500.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
