But with the surprise announcement that the firm is joining a hostile tender offer for a little-known Pittsburgh company, Wall Street is wondering whether Shearson may have shot itself in the foot.    Will Shearson's corporate clients think twice about using an investment bank that initiated, funded and participated as an equity partner in a hostile bid? No clients would publicly confirm such sentiments yesterday, and Shearson executives say they haven't received any phone calls expressing worry. But they privately acknowledge their vulnerability to criticism.    &quot;What Shearson has done is unique,&quot; said one leading takeover lawyer. &quot;A number of investment banks have looked at doing the same kind of thing, but shied away because they feared a negative reaction among their clients. It's intriguing that Shearson thinks it can get away with it.&quot;    What Shearson has done, in effect, is become the first big investment bank to act in a corporate raider's role. Other investment banks advise and even lend money to companies making hostile bids, but they haven't become equity partners, too.    Nine months ago, J. Tomilson Hill, Shearson's co-head of mergers and acquisitions, approached Beazer PLC, a British construction materials concern. He broached the idea of launching a bid for Koppers Co., a sleepy Pittsburgh construction materials and chemicals concern.    When Beazer expressed doubt about its ability to take on the additional debt needed, Shearson agreed to take a 46% equity stake in a group that would seek control of Koppers. Beazer took a 49% stake, and a British investment bank took the remainder. The structure of the partnership also allowed the group to bypass federal antitrust regulations that would have prohibited the members from easily accumulating a large position in Koppers stock; yesterday, the group disclosed that it held a 7.45% stake in the company.    By joining the hostile bid, Shearson stepped over the line investment banks have long considered but rarely, if ever, crossed. Shearson's move is further evidence that investment banking firms and commercial banks are willing to take bigger and bigger risks -- particularly in alienating their clients -- to grab a larger piece of the profits from Wall Street's lucrative mergers and acquisitions business.    Earlier this year, for instance, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a major bank, made the extraordinary move of advising a suitor in a hostile bid for one of its longtime clients, Sterling Drug Inc. And Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. is serving as co-adviser on Batus Inc.'s $4.5 billion hostile tender offer for Farmers Group Inc., despite Goldman's longstanding policy against backing hostile bids.    &quot;The risk to Shearson is that their competitors will try to portray them as being corporate raiders,&quot; said Don Carter, a leading proxy solicitor. &quot;But most public companies fail to see the difference between a (short-term) bridge loan and an equity investment, anyway. Shearson stepped over the line, but it shouldn't hurt them. And I think others will follow suit.&quot;    Like Morgan, Shearson appears to have weighed the risks of its move carefully. Mr. Hill and others saw the possibility for big profits if the Koppers takeover were successful, and concluded there was little risk of alienating significant numbers of clients. The decision to support the Beazer bid was approved by the highest executives of Shearson and its corporate parent, American Express Co., including Shearson Chairman Peter Cohen. And the selection of Koppers as a target seemed designed to limit the bid's controversy.    &quot;They selected the right kind of target. Koppers is a real sleepy company no one's ever heard of,&quot; said the head of mergers at a rival Wall Street firm.    Shearson executives played down the firm's involvement in the Koppers transaction. &quot;This is stepping further than we have before, but it's the same concept as a bridge loan, helping out a client,&quot; said Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers with Mr. Hill. &quot;This is not the first of a trend. We've had no calls from clients about this or anything else. It is simply a logical extension of our normal job on an ad hoc basis.&quot;    The taking of equity in a hostile bid isn't a far cry from Shearson's bustling business in bridge loans, in which the investment bank makes temporary loans to corporate clients to support takeovers. In those loans, Shearson and other investment banks use their own capital; the loans are typically refinanced by the subsequent sale of high-yield securities known as junk bonds.    &quot;If the making of a bridge loan is appropriate, then the taking of an equity position is a modest step up from that,&quot; said Arthur Fleischer, a leading takeover lawyer.    Added Donald Drapkin, a vice chairman and takeover strategist at Revlon Group Inc.: &quot;This seems like a logical extension of where the investment banks and even the commercial banks have been headed. It was bound to happen. I expect it will be a widespread phenomenon.&quot;    But senior officials at several competing investment banks quickly disavowed any similar moves, although they declined to say so publicly. &quot;We wouldn't do that -- we don't need to,&quot; sniffed one official. Added another: &quot;Shearson has entered another dimension. I don't see any prospect of us doing that. It would make our clients very uneasy.&quot;    Publicly at least, Shearson's clients seem calm. Several clients reached yesterday said it was too early to say whether Shearson would turn the Koppers transaction into a trend. Said a Burlington Industries Inc. executive, &quot;It's awfully difficult to make a statement based on one instance.&quot;    ---   William Celis III contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
