The Commerce Department said the current account deficit rose by2 percent over the January-March imbalance of $30.39 billion. Itmarked the second consecutive quarterly setback and provided freshevidence, economists said, of how entrenched America's tradeproblems are.   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, isthe most important trade statistic because it measures not onlytrade in merchandise but also trade in services.   The deficit in merchandise trade actually narrowed during thespring, falling by 2.3 percent to $27.7 billion, the smallestimbalance in merchandise trade in more than four years.   However, this improvement was offset by the first deficit in theservices category since 1958.   That category, which primarily reflects investment earningsbetween countries, registered a deficit of $176 million in thesecond quarter, compared with a surplus of $1.5 billion in the firstquarter.   Analysts called the services deficit an ominous sign asforeigners begin to earn more and more on their U.S. investments,making it even more difficult for the country to close its trade gap.   ``The negative services payment is a distressing omen. We are nowpaying more to foreigners on their U.S. investments than we areearning on our assets in foreign countries and that is worrisome,''said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.   While the spring services deficit was small and could well berevised away in coming reports, analysts said the trend is clear:The United States will be forced to transfer more and more wealthoverseas to service the growing level of foreign holdings in theUnited States.   John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, an economicconsulting company, said he expected the services trade categorywould be in deficit throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact thatthe United States is the world's largest debtor country.   Simply put, that means foreigners own more in U.S. assets thanAmericans own overseas. America's net debtor position stood at$532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen byanother $120 billion this year.   Many economists predict that U.S. living standards will begindeclining because financing the growing foreign debt burden willmake less funds available in this country.   ``We are a half-trillion dollars in debt to the rest of the worldand debtors must eventually pay the piper,'' Hagens said.   In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of thecurrent account deficit, U.S. foreign aid payments and pensions toAmericans living overseas, fell by 11.4 percent to $3.1 billion inthe spring.   The current account deficit reflects the sum of the deficits inservices, merchandise trade and so-called unilateral transfers.   For the first six months of the year, the current account deficitran at an annual rate of $122.76 billion, down only slightly fromthe 1988 deficit of $126.55 billion.   While the 1988 deficit reflected a 12 percent improvement from anall-time high of $143.7 billion in 1987, many economists predictedthat the current account will show little improvement this year andwill actually begin to worsen again in 1990.   They base this pessimism on the deterioration in America'sinvestment position and an expected slowdown in merchandise exportgrowth, reflecting the big rise in the dollar's value in the pastyear. A higher dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive on overseasmarkets.   The Commerce Department on Friday will report on the monthlymerchandise trade performance for July. In advance of that report,many economists were expecting the deficit to worsen to around $9billion, up from June's $8.17 billion deficit.   At the start of this decade, the United States was runningsurpluses in its current account because earnings from Americaninvestments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits inmerchandise trade.   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreignhands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investmentcushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when theUnited States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.   While the United States has been a net debtor for four years, thecountry still enjoyed a surplus in investment earnings because manyof the U.S. investments were older and brought in more of a returnthan the newer foreign investments in this country.</TEXT></DOC>
