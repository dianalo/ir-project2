(Hetestified in several state legislatures against bills toimpose labeling of records with offensive contents.) But evenhe seems startled by the escalating crusade againstheavy-metal rockers and black rap groups.</LP><TEXT>   The well-publicized rap group 2 Live Crew continues tocause arrests. In San Antonio, David Risher, owner of thatcity's Hog Wild Record and Tape store, was arraigned recentlyon a charge of promoting obscene material. Ignoring policewarnings, he had sold a copy of the group's record to the sonof a local anti-pornography crusader. Since the record &quot;AsNasty as They Wanna Be&quot; was ruled obscene in May by a federaljudge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police in Texas, Florida andOhio have told store owners not to sell it. In Dallas anassistant DA, a candidate for a local judgeship, has begun totarget two of the largest record chains in the state. Threemembers of the group itself were busted after an &quot;adultsonly&quot; performance in Fort Lauderdale.   But more is involved than a vulgar and musically mediocregroup of ghetto kids. The British heavy-metal group JudasPriest is currently spending its days in a Reno, Nev.,courtroom. The group's members are defendants, along with CBSrecords in a product-liability suit that charges their record&quot;Stained Class&quot; implanted subliminal suggestions that causedtwo fans to commit suicide. Even the &quot;stickering&quot; bills,believed moribund after the industry adopted a voluntaryprogram, are making a comeback. One recently passed theLouisiana Legislature, but was promptly vetoed by thegovernor.   It seems that Crowell's sleeping giant is beginning tostir, prodded by opportunistic politicians, and it may lumberalong for a while, causing a great deal of damage. Electedofficials must be sensing a constituency demand to bringthese obscenity cases. Otherwise, why risk the predictableridicule in the national press? Furthermore, support for thiscensorship isn't simply a case of middle-class parentsreacting to adolescent provocation.   The most chilling report in the midst of the BrowardCounty, Fla., uproar over 2 Live Crew actually concerned aschool play at the Wilton Manors Elementary School.   Staff at the South Florida school had written a musicalcalled &quot;In Quest of the Banjo Man&quot; to help teach geography.Some 100 fifth-graders were set to stage the tale of astarfish who crawls from continent to continent, encounteringa variety of cultures. That is, until parents of one studentread and reread the script, carefully annotating what theysaw as references to voodoo, paganism and devil worship. Theparents noted, for instance, that the play mentioned 33countries in Europe, which multiplied by two is 66, one digitshort of the &quot;Number of the Beast,&quot; 666. These parents,supported by their pastor, took their complaint to the schoolprincipal, who canceled the play.   The complaints were one thing. People have been seeingSatan under the bed for a long time. What's new is thatcommunity leaders are taking them seriously. Several yearsago, we laughed at the activist who heard a paean to thedevil in a backward version of the theme song to &quot;Mr. Ed,&quot;the television series about a talking horse. Now his group isleading the crusade against 2 Live Crew.   These far-out attitudes gain respectability as they moveinto a void called &quot;defense of Middle Class values.&quot; Mostpeople are disgusted by obscenity. If the courts and &quot;opinionleaders&quot; have trouble defining it, less bashful crusaderspick up support by default. And if there is a history ofdebate on literary standards, the field is wide open when itcomes to music.   As a musician, Crowell asks why people are picking on therecord industry when dirty books and X-rated videos sellfreely. One reason is that religious crusaders have graspedan idea that still eludes traditional politicians, that musicis a supremely important political phenomenon.   This idea, as old as Plato, recently gained currency inAllan Bloom's surprise best seller, &quot;The Closing of theAmerican Mind.&quot; But it was already percolating in theevangelical debate over using rock 'n' roll as a means ofreligious expression. (A leading opponent of &quot;Christianrock,&quot; the fallen preacher Jimmy Swaggart, is a talentedmusician himself, and the cousin of rockabilly great JerryLee Lewis.)   Mr. Bloom's, and Swaggart's, argument centers on music asan expression of a state of soul. In the classicalunderstanding, the city should foster the mode of musicappropriate to its regime. Although Mr. Bloom became famousfor denouncing rock 'n' roll, his point was to explain Plato.It wouldn't be the first time that a subtle exercise inphilosophy spawned a political monster.   Mr. Bloom's fans are attacking rap and heavy metal in aspirit that was possibly appropriate to the homogeneous,small-scale Greek city-state, but becomes a disaster imposedon modern mass culture. In modern form, this spirit hascaused most of the miseries of the miserable 20th century.   A country performer such as Rodney Crowell might be morein tune with the tastes of Swaggart's constituency, but hesenses how dangerous it might be to inflame and mislead itspassions. The politicians who smell a soft target in themusic industry should listen to his warning.   ---   Mr. Adams, a former editorialist for this newspaper, is afree-lance writer based in Otis, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
