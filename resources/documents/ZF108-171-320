DVORAKandM;Sometimes I wonder about the future of mankind when I see the ubiquitousmicroprocessor sneaking its way into perfectly good mechanical devices.andP;  Thisattempt to jazz things up with programmability, voice synthesis, and othergimcrackery is getting ridiculous.andP;  Do we really need a Coke machine thatsays &quot;Thank you!&quot; or a water cooler that reminds us to properly dispose ofthe paper cup?andM;Now I'm told about a prototype programmable VCR with artificial intelligencethat not only spots and deletes commercials but learns your viewing habits soit can automatically record what you want to watch.andP;  Here's something nobodyneeds.andP;  If you're so preoccupied with TV that you'd consider such a thing,it's time to look within.andM;Vendors are also hoping that the networks can somehow provide a signal thatdescribes the show in enough detail to provide the VCR owner with an itemizedreport and index of what was recorded.andP;  A small printer may produce a listingthus: &quot;Program One (index 0000)--PBS Special on Computer Viruses, host:William Shatner, the history and future of computer viruses and othercomputer crime, 48 mins.andP;  Program Two (index 1344)--Eyewitness News at 11,local news, sports, and weather, 23 mins.&quot;andP;  You get the idea.andP;  Who needsthis?andP;  Most of us watch the news, maybe one or two PBS shows a month, a tonof sitcoms, and a miscellany of junk--&quot;Totally Hidden Video,&quot; &quot;Wheel ofFortune,&quot; &quot;Entertainment Tonight.&quot;andM;Should we have a machine making sure we don't miss any of this trash?andP;  Whatwe need is a machine that refuses to record TV and chides us to read more orget out and exercise.andM;In the next decade, as the circuitry for an entire loaded PC-XT shrinks to acouple of chips, we can expect more and more special-purpose computers to beslipped into more and more appliances.andP;  If electricity runs through a deviceor if a small battery can be added, then some nutball is going to see noreason not to have it talk or be programmable or have some robotic function.andO;We'll see talking pencils and pickle jars and programmable flour tins.andP;  &quot;Yourflour's relative moisture content has increased.andP;  Please check the seal!&quot;andM;Today's office is already suffering from an influx of needlessprogrammability.andP;  Take the ever-popular voice-mail system (please!).andP;  Ifservice hasn't degenerated enough in this country, now we have useless robotsanswering the phone and having us do all the work.andP;  &quot;If you know theextension of the party you're calling, press the number now.andP;  If you want totalk to a salesman, press 3.andP;  For the operator, press 0.&quot;andP;  Usually you getrouted from box to box and never find anyone to help you.andM;It's no coincidence that this is actually computerized answering machine, andanswering machines have never been a good idea in an office environment.andO;They belong in the one-person shop, the home, or the dorm.andP;  It used to be asin in a big company for some yahoo to hook up an aswering machine to hisextension.andP;  Now, suddenly, because it's called voice mail, it's beeninstitutionalized.andP;  You can thank the microprocessor.andP;  &quot;Hi, you've reachedGeneral Motors.andP;  We're not in right now.andP;  Please leave a message at the soundof the beep.&quot;andM;What's amazing is how voice mail's defenders come out of the woodwork withall sorts of rationales for its use.andP;  The reasoning centers on the dubious&quot;fact&quot; that you can't get good help anymore.andP;  I suppose this is true if youdon't want to pay more than minimum wage or train someone properly.andP;  Then,no, you can't get good slave labor.andP;  So you follow the new road to doom.andP;  A)Add a voice-mail system.andP;  B) Anger clients and lose sales.andP;  C) Go broke.andP;  D)Blame the fact that you can't get good help.andM;If, in the businesses of the future, people aren't more versatile and usefulthan a preprogrammed microprocessor, we may as well fold up our tents andwelcome the depression and the eventual end of mankind--unless we really liketalking to pickle jars and Coke machines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
