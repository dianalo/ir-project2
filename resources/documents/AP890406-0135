Charles Allen, who held the post for two years, was dismissedWednesday by Charles Travis, executive director of the Texas Parksand Wildlife Department.   Several news stories have disclosed that Parks and Wildlifeemployees stocked fish and game on private lands belonging topolitically powerful Texans, including state House Speaker GibLewis.   Lewis, an avid hunter, said Thursday that the controversysurrounding the department since February was unwarranted.   ``I do have some friends around the country, and I called themto find out. The only reason that there was any cases brought (is)because of the press play that this has received back in Austin,Texas,'' Lewis said.   The speaker maintains the animals in question remain publicproperty and that anyone could take part in the stocking programs.He said the firing of Allen threatens destruction of ``one of thebest parks and wildlife departments in the country.''   Travis was unavailable for comment Thursday, his secretary said,and he didn't immediately to return a call from The AssociatedPress.   In a brief statement, he gave no reason for the firing. He alsosaid that after reviewing a continuing internal investigation, ``Itis my opinion that Mr. Allen did not knowingly violate any criminalstatute.''   Allen, 40, also could not be reached Thursday; there was noanswer at his home phone. He has declared his innocence of threefelony and six misdemeanor charges brought against him last week inAlamagordo, N.M.   Allen served as net gunner in a helicopter mission Jan. 30 totrap 40 antelope. Authorities charge the helicopter strayed overNew Mexico and that Allen took three antelope illegally.</TEXT></DOC>
