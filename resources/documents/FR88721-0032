That one agency subsequently referencedPart 24 (53 FR 4964) on February 19, 1988. These agencies are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Agriculture</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Commerce</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Defense</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Education</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Energy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">General Services Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Health and Human Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of the Interior</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Justice</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Labor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Tennessee Valley Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Transportation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Veterans Administration</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, the United States Postal Service issued a Final Rulein 39 CFR Part 777 on December 17, 1987 (52 FR 48029) to amend the PostalService's regulations to make them consistent with the 1987 Amendments.This proposed rule, if promulgated, would implement all of the remainingprovisions of the 1987 Amendments by amending the existing interim finalrule. Following consideration of comments received in response to thisnotice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), as well as in response to the interimfinal rule, we anticipate promulgating a final rule in Part 24 that wouldreplace the interim final rule. For the easy reference of the reader, Part24 as proposed to be revised herein is printed in its entirety in orderto present a complete full text regulation.As originally enacted, the Uniform Act authorized ``the head of each Federalagency'' to establish regulations and procedures for implementing the UniformAct. Inevitably, this led to significant differences in agency implementingregulations. In a March 8, 1978, Report to Congress (GAO Report No. GGD-78-6,``Changes Needed in the Relocation Act to Achieve More Uniform Treatmentof Persons Displaced by Federal Programs'', B-148044 (1978)), the ComptrollerGeneral found that as a result of these differences the Federal governmentwas not providing uniform treatment to people displaced from their homesand businesses by Federal or federally assisted programs. Those differencesamong Federal implementing regulations also imposed significant administrativeburdens on State and local governments.In 1981, for the Vice President's Presidential Task Force on RegulatoryRelief, State and local governments identified the Uniform Act as a goodcandidate for State and local regulatory relief. Therefore, in May 1982,the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) formed a Uniform Act InteragencyRegulatory Review Working Group to develop uniform regulations to be implementedby each agency covered by the Uniform Act. On February 27, 1985, a PresidentialMemorandum was signed and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 5, 1985 (50 FR 8953), naming the Departmentof Transportation (DOT) as the agency with lead responsibility for theUniform Act. The Secretary of the Department of Transportation delegatedthis responsibility to the Federal Highway Administration. On March 5,1985 (50 FR 8953), DOT published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a model Uniform Act rule, which, in accordancewith the President's February 27, 1985 memorandum, served as the basisfor a proposed common Uniform Act rule for the 16 other affected agencies(50 FR 8955). The proposed common rule was issued for comment by those16 agencies on May 28, 1985 (50 FR 21712). After consideration of comments,the disparate regulations of all affected agencies were superseded by thecommon rule which was published as a final rule on February 27, 1986 (51FR 7000). This common rulemaking effort, applicable to both direct Federalprograms and projects and federally-assisted programs and projects undertakenby State or local agencies, achieved consistency in regulations among theseparate Federal agencies.To a significant extent, this common rulemaking effort presaged many ofthe statutory changes to the Uniform Act made by the 1987 Amendments. Inthe administrative area, for example, the Amendments specifically designatethe DOT as lead agency and require it, in coordination with other Federalagencies, to issue rules, establish procedures and make interpretationsto implement provisions of the Uniform Act. In the substantive area, withthe major exception of payment levels or criteria that were set by statute,the common rulemaking effort granted greater flexibility and discretionto State and local agencies, a theme reiterated in the 1987 Amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of the 1987 Amendments</ITAG>On Tuesday, May 19, 1987 (52 FR 18768) the FHWA issued a Notice describingsignificant changes in the law and general plans to implement those changes.On Tuesday, December 1, 1987 (52 FR 45667) the FHWA issued a Notice ofRegulatory Intent giving further notice of the specific regulatory actionsthat it and the other affected Federal agencies would take to implementthe 1987 Amendments.On December 17, 1987 (52 FR 47994) the FHWA issued an interim final rulein Part 24 that revised the common rule to include those provisions ofthe 1987 Amendments (primarily increases in the dollar amounts of specificrelocation benefits) that did not allow for discretion in their implementation.This was done to allow those Federal, State and local agencies that werewilling and able to implement those provisions to do so expeditiously.On the same day (52 FR 48015) 17 Federal Departments and agencies thatadminister the Uniform Act published interim final rules rescinding thecommon rule from each of their regulations and adopting in its place across-reference to the single governmentwide regulation published by FHWAat 49 CFR Part 24. The effective date for these agency rescissions andcross references varied, however all such actions will take effect on orbefore April 2, 1989, the date the 1987 Amendments become mandatory.An eighteenth Federal Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD), was unable to join the other Federal agencies in publishing an interimfinal rescission and cross referencing action on December 17, 1987, becauseof its need to first satisfy certain Congressional review obligations.HUD subsequently published such an interim rule on February 19, 1988 (53FR 4964).While comments were sought on these interim rules, only eight commentswere received, seven by FHWA and one by the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment (HUD). The seven comments received by FHWA did not addresseither the establishment of a single governmentwide regulation at 49 CFRPart 24, the agency rescission and cross-referencing actions, or the changesmade in the interim rule. Rather, they concerned matters that are addressedin this NPRM, and they will therefore be considered, along with the commentsreceived in response to this NPRM, in the development of a final rule.The one comment received by HUD objected to any delay in the effectivedate of the rescission and cross-referencing action contained in HUD'sinterim rule. However, the comment did not otherwise object to the rescissionand cross-referencing action itself. Since no comments were received concerning the use of rescission and cross-referencingactions by the various agencies to establish a single governmentwide regulation,the individual agencies will finalize their interim final actions. HUDwill consider the comment concerning its interim rule's effective datebefore its interim rule is finalized. Accordingly, the changes proposed in this NPRM, if adopted, will governthe relocation and land acquisition programs of all those 18 Federal departmentsand agencies, as well as the United States Postal Service. Those departmentsand agencies, and the parts of the Code of Federal Regulations which willcontain a cross reference to this part, are listed below: <ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Agriculture</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">7 CFR Part 21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Commerce</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">15 CFR Part 11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Defense</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">32 CFR Part 259</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Education</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">34 CFR Part 15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Energy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">10 CFR Part 1039</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Environmental Protection Agency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">40 CFR Part 4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">44 CFR Part 25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">General Services Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">41 CFR Part 105-51</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Health and Human Services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">45 CFR Part 15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Housing and Urban Development</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">24 CFR Part 42</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of the Interior</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">41 CFR Part 114-50</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Justice</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">41 CFR Part 128-18</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Department of Labor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">29 CFR Part 12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">14 CFR Part 1208</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">36 CFR Part 904</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Tennessee Valley Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">18 CFR Part 1306</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Veterans Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">38 CFR Part 25</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The United States Postal Service will incorporate changes in its full-textregulation at 39 CFR Part 777 and intends to publish its final rule simultaneouslywith the publication of the final governmentwide rule at 49 CFR Part 24.All members of the public who are affected by relocation or land acquisitionactivities undertaken or funded by those departments and agencies are encouragedto comment on this NPRM. Comments from interested State and local governmentsare particularly requested. A description of the regulatory changes proposed in this part are set forthbelow. The only major changes proposed are those required by enactmentof the 1987 Amendments. Where no such changes are required, the provisionsof the governmentwide rule are generally repeated in this proposed rule.That is, the proposed rule is basically the same as the governmentwiderule with the exception of those changes that are necessary to fully implementthe 1987 Amendments. Comments are invited on both those non-discretionarychanges that were adopted in the December 17, 1987, interim final ruleand the remaining changes proposed in this NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Meetings </ITAG>In furtherance of the statutory objective of securing the views of Stateand local governments and the public in the promulgation of these regulations,the Federal Highway Administration proposes to conduct three public meetingsduring the comment period following publication of this proposed rule.The purpose of these meetings will be to receive comments on the proposedrule from interested parties. These comments will be entered in FHWA DocketNo. 87-22 and will be given full consideration prior to issuance of thefinal rule. The meetings will be held during the comment period. Dates for the meetingsare August 17, 1988 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, August 22 in Portland,Oregon and August 24 in Chicago, Illinois. Specific information relativeto these meetings will be detailed in a notice soon to be published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Speakers are invited to make brief presentations of no more than 10 minutesand will be scheduled based on the order of pre-registration and registrationat the door. Written comments may also be submitted. Persons wishing toreserve presentation time or seating should contact Ms. Barbara J. Satorius,Realty Specialist, Policy Development Branch, HRW-11, (202) 366-0116, FederalHighway Administration, Washington, DC at least 10 days in advance of themeeting they wish to attend. The major changes made by the 1987 amendments include: _Expansion of the Uniform Act coverage to include virtually all activitiesthat receive Federal funds, including those undrtaken by private entities._A moderate increase in benefit levels. _The establishment of a lead agency to issue a single governmentwide implementingregulation. _Providing that the computation of certain relocation benefits be donein accordance with the lead agency regulations, rather than prescribingthe computation method in the statute. _Granting State greater flexibility and discretion in implementing theprovisions of the Uniform Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of the Changes in This NPRM</ITAG>The changes proposed in this NPRM are described in detail below. (For adescription of the nondiscretionary provisions of the 1987 Amendments adoptedin the interim final rule the reader is directed to the preamble to thatrule at 52 FR 47994, December 17, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General</ITAG>Section 24.1 Purpose.A new paragraph (c) is proposed to replace the current paragraph whichrefers to changes made by the interim rule. The new paragraph would establishefficient and cost effective implementation as one of the primary purposesof this part. We are particularly concerned that State and local implementingagencies not be burdened with unnecessary regulatory requirements. In thisregard such agencies should be fully aware of the waiver provision in andSection;24.7 and should utilize it when its use could avoid unnecessary delay oradministrative burdens.Section 24.2 Definitions.Section 24.2(a) contains proposed definitions based on the generic term``agency'' which are found in the amended Uniform Act. These proposed definitionsrelate to particular functions agencies may be performing at a given timein program or project development. These definitions are not mutually exclusiveand a single ``agency'' may be an acquiring agency, a displacing agencyand/or a State agency, or all three, at various times during the performanceof its Uniform Act activities.Most significant is the fact that the 1987 Amendments broadened UniformAct coverage to provide that a ``person'' who receives Federal financialassistance is now considered to be included within the definitions of acquiringagency, displacing agency, State agency or agency, depending upon the circumstances.It should be noted that, as a result of the 1987 Amendments, the relocationprovisions in Title II of the Uniform Act now apply to all ``displacingagencies''. That term, as it is defined in the 1987 Amendments, includesall private entities that carry out projects with Federal financial assistancethat cause people to be displaced whether or not such entities have thepower of eminent domain. The real property acquisition policies and proceduresin Title III of the Uniform Act, however, now apply to Federal agenciesand to ``acquiring agencies'' that receive Federal financial assistance.Acquiring agencies are all State and private entities that have the powerof eminent domain and such State or private entities without the powerof eminent domain, to the extent provided in the lead agency regulations.While the term ``Agency'' is generally used throughout this proposed part,the proposed part reflects these changes in Uniform Act coverage.In andSection; 24.2(b) the definition of the term ``appraisal'' would beshifted from Subpart B to this subpart, without change.Section 24.2(d) contains a new definition of a ``comparable replacementdwelling''. The proposed definition is based on the new statutory definitionof a comparable replacement dwelling and proposes additional informationon the meaning of the terms ``functionally equivalent'' and ``financialmeans'' as used in the definition.Section 24.2(d)(8)(ii) defines the term ``financial means'' for a personrenting a replacement dwelling. (See Subpart E of this preamble).Section 24.2(d)(8)(iii) proposes financial means criteria for displacedpersons not eligible for payments under andSection;andSection; 24.401 or 24.402of Subpart E of this part. It is proposed that such persons, because oftheir short tenure at the displacement dwelling, be required to contribute,to the extent they are able, to any increased costs for affordable comparablereplacement housing.Proposed andSection; 24.2(g) expands and modifies the definition of ``displacedperson'' eligible for the benefits of the Uniform Act. The most significantadditions to the definition, which derive from the 1987 amendments, bringpersons displaced as a direct result of the rehabilitation or demolitionof their dwellings within the coverage of the law.Section 24.2(g)(2)(iv) would apply primarily to certain residential tenantsaffected by rehabilitation activities undertaken with financial assistanceprovided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Thissection indicates that residential tenants who are not required to movepermanently from the building or from a nearby building on the real propertyas a result of such activities are not to be considered displaced personswithin the meaning of the Uniform Act if they are provided with specificprotections. These include an offer of a lease for a suitable, decent,safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building (or in a nearby buildingon the real property) under reasonable terms and conditions of continuedoccupancy, and reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs associated with anytemporary relocation (including moving expenses incurred, and any increasedrental and/or utility charges which a tenant is required to pay duringthe period of the temporary relocation to a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling).This proposed regulation does not directly address an important issue relatingto rehabilitation activities. The expanded definition of ``displaced person''added by the 1987 Amendments includes residential tenants displaced asa direct result of assisted rehabilitation activities. Considerable controversyhas arisen over the question of whether this definition covers a tenantwho need not relocate permanently as a result of the physical alterationof his dwelling or a change in its legal ownership, but whose rent is increasedsignificantly following the completion of rehabilitation activities, resultingin the tenant moving elsewhere.Relocation assistance is now offered such tenants in some programs administeredby HUD, but this is done on the basis of administrative requirements notemanating from the Uniform Act. HUD takes the position that a rental increasewhich prompts relocation is not a direct result of rehabilitation, as isrequired for coverage of the Uniform Act, but is an indirect or secondaryresult of the assisted rehabilitation. While HUD generally agrees thatits program regulations should provide for assistance to tenants movingas a result of these rental increases, HUD does not believe that such tenantsare covered by the 1987 Amendments. Proposed andSection; 24.2(g)(2)(iv) wouldnot include such tenants within the definition of ``displaced person''so long as the other conditions set forth in the section were satisfied.From 1971 to 1975 HUD regulations implementing the Uniform Act, appearingat 24 CFR Part 42, did contain a provision permitting relocation assistancefor those whose rent increased ten percent or more following activitiesdesignated ``voluntary rehabilitation'' under the urban renewal and modelcities programs. Such activities under these specified programs were deemed``acquisition'' for purposes of establishing eligibility for benefits underthe Uniform Act by section 217 of the legislation, which has now been repealed.Nothing in section 217 or elsewhere in the statute addressed this questionof rental increases, however. The regulatory provision was included topreserve a policy of the urban renewal program which had been followedsince 1965. HUD did not believe that this policy had any basis in the law,and therefore eliminated it from its revised Uniform Act regulations whichwere published in February, 1975. HUD points out that this policy was notchallenged by Congress or in the courts and has remained operative forthe last thirteen years. HUD generally supports program regulations whichprovide relocation assistance to residential tenants that move becauseof substantial rent increases following rehabilitation, but believes thatthese regulations must be tailored to each such HUD program, and are notbased upon the provisions of the Uniform Act. One effect of this approachwould be to limit the uniformity among Federal and federally assisted programsthat provide relocation assistance. Such uniformity is a primary goal ofthe Uniform Relocation Act.To summarize, the 1987 Amendments alter section 101(6) of the Uniform Actto include as eligible for benefits residential tenants who move as a directresult of rehabilitation. HUD takes the position that Congress did notintend the 1987 Amendments to cover displacement resulting from rent increasesthat follow rehabilitation since they are the secondary consequence ofassisted activities, and that Congress fully understood and recognizedthe distinction between the ``direct'' and the ``indirect'' results ofassisted rehabilitation.A contrary opinion holds that these rental increases are such an integraland foreseeable consequence of assisted rehabilitation activities thatdisplacement resulting from such increases must be considered to be a directresult of rehabilitation.It also has been suggested that a further condition be added to proposedandSection; 24.2(g)(2)(iv) to provide that so long as the tenant is offeredan opportunity to rent an adequate decent, safe, and sanitary dwellingat a rent that is the same as that paid by the tenant before the project,or 30% of the household's gross income, whichever is greater, such tenantwould not be considered a displaced person. If the rent for the dwellingoffered to the tenant exceeded the greater of those figures, the tenantwould then be considered a displaced person.We invite public comment on this extremely important issue. Also, commentis solicited on any other federally funded activity which may cause a personto be displaced.Section 24.2(j) proposes to except any interest reduction payment to anindividual for the purchase and occupancy of a residence from the definitionof Federal financial assistance. This exception is contained in the 1987Amendments.Section 24.2(k)(2) proposes to define the action which is the ``initiationof negotiations'' for displacements caused by rehabilitation, demolitionor certain privately undertaken acquisitions, where there is no relatedacquisition by a Federal or State agency.Section 24.2(l) is a proposed addition to this section which simply adoptsthe statutory definition of the term ``mortgage''.Section 24.2(m) proposes a definition of the term ``nonprofit organization''that would make it clear that this term refers to those organizations thatare exempt from income taxes under section 501 of the Internal RevenueCode (26 U.S.C. 501).Section 24.2(n) proposes to revise the definition of ``owner of a replacementdwelling'' to include the owner of any dwelling.Section 24.2(p) includes a new definition of the term ``project''. Theeffect of this proposed definition would be to exclude from coverage underthis part those actions or activities that result from Federal or federallyassisted payments that are made to individuals or families and which areintended primarily to assist or benefit such individual or family.Section 24.2(r) contains a proposed definition of the term ``small business''.It is a simple definition chosen for easy application to the eligibilityrequirements for the business reestablishment payment which was added bythe 1987 Amendments. The proposed use of the number of employees (500)at the affected site as the sole criterion for defining a small businessprecludes an agency from having to delve into the financial affairs ofa displaced business in order to qualify it for payments. This definitionincludes a business which may be considered a chain operation under thefixed payment criteria of andSection; 24.304(a)(3), regardless of the totalnumber of persons employed throughout the entire business enterprise, providedno more than 500 persons are employed at the affected site. Specific commenton the 500 employee threshold for the definition of a ``small business''is solicited.Section 24.2(u) defines the term ``uneconomic remnant'' and is shiftedunchanged from Subpart B to this subpart.Section 24.2(v) contains a proposed definition of the term ``unlawful occupancy''.The proposed definition evisions considerable Agency discretion in determininga person's lawful or unlawful occupancy. It discourages the use of trivialtechnical violations of codes or leases to deny eligibility for UniformAct benefits due to unlawful occupancy.Section 24.2(x) is a proposed definition of ``utility costs'' as they pertainto residential or commercial consumers.Section 24.2(y) and (z) are proposed definitions of ``utility facility''and ``utility relocation'' for use in the implementation of andSection; 24.307,Subpart D of this part.Section 24.4 Assurances, monitoring and corrective action.Section 24.4(a)(2) is a proposed alternative to the retirement that allagencies seeking Federal financial assistance must submit assurances tofunding Federal agencies that they will comply with the Uniform Act andthis part. The details of the alternative procedure are found at SubpartG of this part.Section 24.6 Administration of jointly-funded projects.This section proposes to implement the new statutory mandate requiringthe lead agency to designate one Federal agency as the cognizant agencywhen two or more Federal agencies fund activities in geographic or functionallyrelated areas and when such agencies cannot agree upon which agency's proceduresshould be followed by the Agency or Agencies carrying out such activities.Section 24.9 Recordkeeping and reports.Section 24.9(c) requires that real property acquisition and displacementactivities be reported in the format contained in Appendix B of this part.Appendix B proposes the use of a revised report form which has been reformatted,but does not require additional statistical data except for one added entryconcerning the new business reestablishment payment. Special considerationand comment on the format and timing of this report is requested.Section 24.10 Appeals.Section 24.10(b) contains a proposed modification to accommodate the statutoryexpansion which allows any issue relating to an aggrieved person's applicationto be appealed. Because the statute is silent as to what issues shouldbe appealable, it is proposed that any issue affecting a person's eligibilityfor, or the amount of a payment, including an Agency's failure to grantappropriate waivers in hardship cases could be appealed. This could alsoinclude issues involving benefit levels which are subject to Agency discretion.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Real Property Acquisition</ITAG>Section 24.101(a)(1) would be clarified by including language addressingvoluntary transactions. The current language would be removed from AppendixA and changed to eliminate the provisions relating to the location of theproperty to be acquired; since the essence of a voluntary transaction concernsonly the fact that an agency will not acquire the property if an amicableagreement is not reached.The 1987 Amendments broadened the scope of the real property provisionsof the Uniform Act implemented in this subpart to include Federal agenciesand acquiring agencies. ``Acquiring agency'' is defined in the 1987 Amendmentsto include both State agencies and persons with authority to acquire propertyby eminent domain; and State agencies or persons without such authority,to the extent provided in the lead agency regulations. (See proposed andSection;24.2(a)(4)). These regulations propose, in andSection; 24.101(a)(3), to generallyexclude a State agency or person without the power of eminent domain fromthe requirements of this subpart, but to require that such agency or person(1) clearly advise any property owner, prior to making an offer, that itis unable to acquire the property except through amicable negotiations,and (2) advise the owner of what it believes to be the fair market valueof the property, based on an appraisal. Comments are specifically requestedon this aspect of the proposed requirements pertaining to an ``acquiringagency,'' particularly with respect to whether these two conditions areadequate to protect persons whose property is purchased by such State agenciesor persons acting without eminent domain authority.Accordingly, it is proposed that this subpart apply to all programs orprojects receiving Federal financial assistance, except where (1) the acquisitioncan be classified as a voluntary transaction, (2) the property to be acquiredis in government ownership and cannot be taken by eminent domain, or (3)an Agency or person is acquiring real property with Federal financial assistance,but without the power of eminent domain. However, such agency or personwould be required to ensure that an owner is advised of the value of theproperty, except as provided in andSection; 24.102(c)(2).Section 24.102(c) proposes to implement the 1987 Amendments which permitswaiver of appraisals. An appraisal would not be required by this subpartwhere the owner is donating the property and releases the acquiring agencyfrom the appraisal obligation. Also it is proposed to permit an acquiringagency to determine that an appraisal is not necessary because the valuationproblem is uncomplicated and the estimated fair market value is $2,500or less. Such determination could be made where the property is being donatedor where the owner is to receive compensation. This proposal is not intendedto preclude any acquiring agency from preparing an appraisal whenever itis deemed prudent to do so. The $2,500 amount is being proposed becauseit is consistent with andSection; 24.103(e). Specific comment on the $2,500amount is requested.Section 24.102(k) proposes to shift the definition of ``uneconomic remnant''to andSection; 24.2(u), Subpart A. The definition is proposed to be revisedslightly to conform to the statutory definition, but no difference in meaningis intended.Section 24.103 proposes to shift the definition of ``appraisal'' to andSection;24.2(b), Subpart A, without change. In addition, the term ``detailed' wouldbe added before ``appraisal'' in andSection; 24.103(a). This is consideredto be an editorial change only. These changes would also require some paragraphrelettering in this section.Section 24.108 proposes revised language to conform to the new statutorylanguage. This revision is considered to be editorial and no change inmeaning is intended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_General Relocation Requirements </ITAG>Section 24.204(c)(2) proposes to add payment of utility costs to increasedrental costs incurred by persons required to temporarily relocate. Thischange is consistent with the overall revised policy regarding inclusionof utility costs as part of the monthy housing costs for displaced tenants.Section 24.205(a) proposes to implement the new statutory requirement forrelocation planning in the early stages of program or project development.Included in this proposed section is a suggested outline of the informationconsidered to be essential to meaningful relocation planning. The Congressviews effective relocation planning as essential for successful completionof any program or project which displaces persons and this proposed sectionis designed to reflect that view. Most displacing agencies are well awareof the program or project benefits which can be derived through early andsound relocation planning and many agencies currently use comprehensiveplanning techniques in project development. We do not, however, view relocationplanning as a complicated, time consuming activity. Relocation planningis seen as a process which provides meaningful information to program orproject decision makers and it need not result in a detailed document whichcontains unnecessary data and needless problem solving. Instead, it shouldbe a process which is scoped to the complexity and nature of anticipatedprogram or project relocation activity and should not require a burdensomecommitment of Agency resources. Proposed andSection; 24.205(b) addresses the issue of loans for planningand preliminary expenses under section 215 of the Uniform Act. While theprovision in section 215 for certain seed money loans remains a part ofthe Federal statute, it is not known to have ever been used, despite theexistence of detailed implementing regulations in 24 CFR Part 43. Thoseregulations will be removed and rescinded on April 2, 1989 (53 FR 4964).The reason for the non-use of section 215 is that it provides project fundingfor purposes for which project funding is already available under othersections of the Act. For this reason it is not considered appropriate topropose further regulations to implement this provision until such timeas there is a demonstrated need to do so. Section 24.205(c)(2)(vi) proposes to add to the list of persons eligiblefor advisory services those persons who occupy an acquired property ona short term rental basis by agreement with the Agency. This class of eligiblepersons was created by the 1987 Amendments. Section 24.208 proposes to implement the new statutory change which willenable an Agency to take relocation assistance payments into account whendetermining a low-income person's eligibility for housing assistance. For editorial purposes, several references in this subpart to other sectionsin this part have been changed and minor language clarifications have beenmade. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Payments for Moving and Related Expenses</ITAG>Section 24.302 proposes a $50 limitation for fixed residential moving paymentsto persons who are eligible for payment under the moving expense and dislocationallowance schedule, but who would incur little or no expense in movingtheir personal property. Special consideration and comment on this limitationis solicited.Sections 24.304 (a), (c) and (d) propose to add the business reestablishmentexpense as an expense item which a business must forego when it electsa fixed payment in lieu of the payments for moving and related expenses.This payment, not to exceed $10,000, was added by the 1987 Amendments andis further described in proposed andSection;24.306. The amended statute alsoprovides that criteria for the fixed payment be established in this part.Sections 24.304(a) (1), (3) and (4) contain new proposed criteria for eligibilityfor the nonresidential fixed payment. Under these proposals a businessmust (1) own or rent personal property which must be moved and the businessitself must vacate the displacement site, (2) the business cannot be partof an enterprise having more than three other entities not being displaced.(This is to correct inequities and hardship frequently suffered by small``chains'' where the displaced entity may be its owner's primary sourceof income), and (3) the business may not be operated solely for the purposeof renting a dwelling to others. (This implements the new statutory exclusionof such business from eligibility for the fixed payment). Sections 24.304(a)(2) and (5) propose to retain two of the eligibility criteria previouslycontained in the Uniform Act relating to loss of patronage and materialcontribution to a person's income.Section 24.304(d) proposes to establish a standard $2,500 fixed paymentfor eligible nonprofit organizations. This recognizes that, while a nonprofitorganization may not have taxable income, it can suffer substantial reductionsin revenue due to displacement. For this same reason it is proposed thatthe condition currently in andSection;24.304(a)(3) that the organizationnot be part of an enterprise having more than one establishment be eliminated.Section 24.306 contains the proposed provisions for implementation of thenew business reestablishment expenses benefit authorized by the 1987 Amendments.This is a payment intended to assist a small business, farm or nonprofitorganization to continue its operation at a new location, under conditionsnot less favorable than those prevailing prior to displacement. This proposedsection contains non-exclusive listings of eligible and ineligible expensesfor which reestablishment payments may be made. Although the statute imposesa $10,000 maximum total amount for this payment, regulatory maximums areproposed for three eligible items. These are for (1) exterior signing toadvertise the business, (2) advertisement of replacement location, andmost importantly, (3) increased costs of operation at the replacement site.In order to minimize the effect of this payment on the replacement siteselection process, particularly in influencing the selection of a far superiorreplacement site, the amount of the business reestablishment payment whichmay be applied to expenses for increased costs of operation is limitedto $5,000 over a two year period. It is not considered appropriate thatsubstantial up-grading of business locations or facilities be made solelybecause public funds may be available for such up-grading. Any enhancementsmust be reasonable and necessary. The alternative to a monetary cap oncosts for up-grading would be to impose a requirement that displacing agenciesuse a formal comparability process to set limits on expenditures for obviouslysuperior replacement sites. This would, in turn, create additional administrativeresponsibilities for the displacing agency. Section 24.306(a)(13) proposesthat a waiver of the regulatory maximum for this eligible item may be permittedin cases where up-grading cannot be avoided.Section 24.307 contains proposed implementation requirements for the discretionaryreimbursement of expenses incurred by owners of utility facilities whichare displaced from publicly owned property by federally funded programsor projects. The authority for such reimbursement is embodied in the 1987Amendments. This proposed section defines and provides for payment of ``extraordinaryexpenses'' incurred by displaced utility facilities. It also proposes eligibilitycriteria and guidance, in Appendix A, as to how agreement may be reachedbetween the Agency and the utility facility owner on such items as scopeof work, betterments, manner of disbursement and amounts of payment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart E_Replacement Housing Payments </ITAG>Section 24.401 Replacement housing payment for 180-day homeowner-occupants.In andSection; 24.401(a)(2) a new provision is proposed which would permita displacing Agency to extend, for good cause, the one-year period duringwhich a displaced homeowner occupant has to purchase and occupy a decent,safe, and sanitary dwelling. This authority is contained in the 1987 Amendments.In andSection; 24.401(b)(2) a slight change in the wording is proposed tocomplement the major language changes that would be made in andSection; 24.401(d).In andSection; 24.401(d) the use of the ``annuity'' formula for determiningthe amount to be paid to a displaced homeowner-occupant for increased mortgageinterest costs would be eliminated. This method, formerly required by statute,has been a source of numerous windfall and unwarranted payments duringpast periods of inflation and high mortgage interest rates. For this reasonit is proposed that the ``annuity'' method no longer be used. Instead,a more reasonable and equitable ``buydown'' approach to payment computationfor increased mortgage interest costs is proposed. This method, which previouslycould only be used for last resort housing cases, was offered as an optionalprocedure in the interim final rule published by DOT on December 17, 1987.We now propose making the exclusive use of this payment computation methodmandatory. As a special note, the lead agency is giving serious consideration to analternative approach to compensation for increased mortgage interest costs.This alternative would be a new simplified procedure for the computationand disbursal of this payment. The simplified procedure is based on a recognitionthat favorable financing is considered to be a valuable attribute, theloss of which should require a relocation payment to its owner. For thisreason, it would be proposed that the displacing agency not impose restrictionsupon the disposition of the proceeds that provide compensation for suchloss. Therefore, the displacing agency would no longer be required to examinethe financial arrangements which the displaced homeowner makes for thepurchase of a replacement dwelling in order to determine the amount ofthe increased mortgage interest payment. The payment determination wouldbe made using a method designed to make it possible for the displaced homeownerto replicate the repayment terms of the existing mortgage(s) on the displacementdwelling, as to both the remaining term of the mortgage(s) and the amountof the monthly payments for principal and interest. Further, the simplified procedure would permit the payments to be madeat a time in the relocation process when it could readily be applied tothe downpayment on the replacement dwelling, thereby reducing the balanceto be financed and lowering the required monthly payments for such financing.If the displaced homeowner wishes to buy his future mortgage down to aneven lower amount with his own funds, even to zero, that is certainly theowner's prerogative and the displacing agency need not follow up to ascertainthe terms for the purchase of the replacement dwelling, except in thosecases were incidental costs will be claimed by the displaced homeowner.It is believed that the simplified procedure would accomplish two desirableobjectives. First, it would provide a payment to the displaced homeownerat a time when such payment could actually be used for its intended purpose,i.e., applied toward the purchase price of the replacement dwelling, therebyoffsetting the impact of any higher new interest rate on the monthly mortgagepayment. Too often in the past, the mortgage interest differential paymentwas not computed until a replacement mortgage had been secured becausethe computation was based on the amount of the new mortgage. Therefore,when the payment was finally made to the displaced homeowner it was toolate to apply the payment amount to the new mortgage in any way that wouldreduce the monthly mortgage payment amount. Secondly, the use of the simplified``buydown'' procedure would significantly reduce the displacing agency'sadministrative burden of having to follow through and examine the financialterm for every displaced homeowner's replacement dwelling. It would alsoreduce paperwork burdens imposed on displaced homeowners. Careful considerationand comment on this possible alternative to the ``buydown'' procedure containedin andSection; 24.401(d) of this subpart is requested. Section 24.402 Replacement housing payment for 90-day occupants. It is proposed that andSection; 24.402(b) be substantially revised to meetthe new statutory requirement that a low income person's income be takeninto consideration when calculating rental assistance payments for comparablereplacement housing. To reflect the requirement that income be taken intoconsideration in the fairest, yet simplest manner, it is proposed thatthis section depart entirely from the current ``make-whole'' approach for90-day occupants and return to a former commonly used base monthly housingcost/monthly income formula for payment determination. It is proposed thatan amount representing 30% of average monthly gross household income beused to compute a displaced person's replacement housing payment if the30% figure is less than the rent actually paid at the displacement dwelling.The 30% figure is proposed as a reasonable percentage of income to be appliedto rental housing costs under current market and economic conditions, andis consistent with the percentage of income figures currently being usedin other subsidized housing and related programs. Further, the 30% of incometest would be applied equally to all 90-day occupants regardless of income.This would assure consideration of income for all low income persons; and,at the same time, eliminate inequities for tenants with marginal incomeswhich might barely exceed criteria established under other methods fordefining low income persons. Finally, because utility expenses are consideredto be an integral part of monthly housing costs, it is proposed that theseexpenses be included in the monthly base housing cost computation. It is proposed that andSection; 24.402(c) be slightly revised to clarifythe new statutory limitations on the amount of downpayment assistance a90-day occupant may receive and the new agency discretion for modifyingthose amounts. Specific comment is requested on the issue of special criteriafor use in the exercise of Agency discretion under this section. Suggestionsare solicited for methods of promoting uniformity and equity in this process.Section 24.403 Additional rules governing replacement housing payments.Because it is proposed that Subpart G, Last Resort Housing, be reformattedand redesignated as andSection; 24.404, andSection; 24.403(b) has been deletedand the balance of andSection; 24.403 has been re-numbered accordingly.Section 24.404. Replacement housing of last resort.It is proposed that Subpart G, Last Resort Housing be reformatted and redesignatedas andSection; 24.404 in order to emphasize that housing of last resort isnot an independent program, but is merely an extension of the replacementhousing function. This simply means that, with few exceptions, the samebasic eligibility criteria, payment computation methods, and displacedperson protections apply equally to all persons eligible for replacementhousing. Therefore, it was felt that the proposed melding of the two functionsinto one subpart might help dispel a common misconception that personsreceiving payments under Section 206 of the Uniform Act are separate anddistinct from those receiving payments under sections 203 and 204 of theAct, each having rights and entitlements that are different and exclusive.In addition to the proposed shift to the new subpart, the last resort housingprocedures would be revised to reflect a change in section 206(a) of theUniform Act, as required by the 1987 Amendments. As amended, section 206(a)now specifically authorizes payments in excess of the maximum amounts payableunder sections 203 and 204, on a case-by-case basis for good cause. Sections24.404(a)(1) of this subpart proposes the elements which must be consideredin determining ``case-by-case for good cause.'' These elements would allbe subject to a fundamental analysis and correlation of the housing needsof persons to be displaced, with the availability of appropriate housingresources to meet those needs, both within the monetary limits for ownersand tenants under this subpart and within acceptable time constraints asdictated by project or program need. Failure of any or all of these elementsto properly correlate would constitute ``case-by-case for good cause''justification for authorizing replacement housing payments in excess ofthe normal prescribed limits.Other minor revisions are proposed in the last resort housing section ofthis subpart. One deals with possible variations from precise comparability,under limited circumstances; another would permit consideration of financialmeans, in special cases; but most are technical or editorial language changesfor purposes of clarification.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart F_Mobile Homes</ITAG>Section 24.502 is proposed to be modified and simplified to apply onlyto the moving of the mobile home dwelling itself. It is considered thatother moving expenses incurred by the occupant of the mobile home are adequatelycovered by andSection; 24.501.This subpart also contains some minor editorial alterations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart G_Certification</ITAG>This subpart proposes implementation of the new process created by the1987 Amendments whereby the head of a Federal agency may discharge his-herresponsibilities under the Uniform Act by accepting a certification bya State agency that it shall accept such responsibility and that it shallconduct its Uniform Act activities in accordance with a State law and regulationswhich serves the same purpose and effect as the Uniform Act. The subpartproposes a multi-step procedure for the certification process. As partof that process, a major role would be played by the State governor orsuch person or agency as the governor designates. The certification processis proposed to proceed in the following manner:1. If a State agency determines that it desires to operate under certifiedState law and regulations, it may submit a request for certification approvalto the governor or State contact designated by the governor.2. The designated contact shall review the request and determine the adequacyof the applicable State law and regulations and of the State agency's staffing.If the designated State contact approves the request, it shall forwardthe request to the Federal funding agency.3. The Federal funding agency shall forward all complete requests to theFederal lead agency, along with its assessment of the State agency's capabilities.4. The Federal lead agency shall review the material received, solicitcomments from the public and local governments, and then make a determinationconcerning the State agency's ability to satisfy Uniform Act responsibilitiesunder the State law.Certification is a new concept for Uniform Act activities. For this reason,special attention and consideration of the proposed process is invited.We are particularly interested in ideas and suggestions as to how thisconcept might best be implemented at the State and Federal levels, as wellas alternative proposals for the sequencing of the certification process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A_Additional Information</ITAG>Proposed modification of the appendix includes the shifting of severalportions of the appendix to the subparts to which they pertain. Discussionsrelative to these changes are found in the preambles for the appropriatesubparts.Section 24.401 Replacement housing payment for 180-day homeowner-occupants.Explanatory information has been added to this section of the appendixrelative to the adjustments required for the ``buydown'' increased mortgageinterest cost payment when a person secures a mortgage on the replacementdwelling which is of a lesser amount than the remaining balance of themortgages on the displacement dwelling.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix B_Statistical Report Form</ITAG>The instructions for completing the form propose to include a line itemfor reporting payments for the new statutory business reestablishment expenseentitlement and the report form has been reformatted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this action does not constitute a major proposedrule under Executive Order 12291 or a significant proposal under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. ExecutiveOrder 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be prepared for``major'' rules which are defined in the Order as any rule that has anannual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more, or has certainother specified effects.The economic impacts of this proposed rulemaking are primarily mandatedby the provisions of the 1987 Amendments. Therefore, a full regulatoryevaluation has not been prepared. However, since some of the statutorychanges are administrative or procedural, savings to Federal, State, andlocal agencies should result in the administration of the Uniform Act.Other statutory changes, which alter benefit levels, and expand the Act'sapplication to include certain private persons who receive Federal financialassistance, and persons displaced by certain nonacquisition activitities,should result in a modest increase in amounts paid under the Uniform Act.However, we do not believe that the proposed regulations will have an annualeconomic effect of $100 million or more, or the other effects listed inthe Executive Order. For this reason, we have determined that these proposedregulations are not a major rule within the meaning of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that for eachrule with a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities'' an analysis be prepared describing the rules impact on smallentities, and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule thatwould minimize the economic impacts on small entities.The provisions of the Uniform Act that are implemented in this proposedrule have not changed substantially. The primary impact of the 1987 Amendmentsis expected to be an increase in benefits provided to small businesses,the elimination of unnecessary administrative requirements imposed on Stateand local agencies, and the consequent reduction of burden on those affectedentities, and the expansion of the Act's application to those private entitiesthat seek and receive Federal financial assistance.Based on information available to FHWA at this time and under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the FHWA hereby certifies that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Requirements</ITAG>Today's proposed rule would make one change to the Uniform Act Report form,which is contained in Appendix B of Part 24. A new item, 7A, would be addedto obtain information relating to the new business reestablishment paymentadded by the 1987 Amendments. Several minor editorial changes would alsobe made in this form. If these proposed changes are adopted, the revisedform will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewunder 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), the Paperwork Reduction Act, Pub. L. 96-511.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>As discussed in the Supplementary Information sections of this preamble,this proposed rule builds upon the positive Federalism accomplishmentsachieved in the promulgation of the governmentwide common rule on February27, 1986 (51 FR 7000) which significantly reduced administrative burdenson States and local recipients of Federal financial assistance. The FHWAhas determined that the Federalism accomplishments of the common rule areretained in today's rule and any proposed changes are fully consistentwith the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 anddo not have sufficient further Federalism implications to warrant the preparationof a complete Federalism Assessment.This proposed rule implements a provision of the 1987 Amendments that givessubstantial additional discretion to the States. This is the certificationprocedure which provides an alternative whereby State agencies, with adequateauthority under State law, can comply with the Uniform Act with a minimumamount of Federal supervision or oversight. As proposed, this certificationprocedure would give maximum authority and control to the State governor,or his or her designee, in managing and coordinating the certificationprocedure in each State.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 24</ITAG>Real property acquisition, Relocation assistance, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: July 15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.

Generally,functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range ofpurposes for which the various physical features of a dwelling may be used.However, in determining whether a replacement dwelling is functionallyequivalent to the displacement dwelling, the Agency may consider reasonabletrade-offs for specific features when the replacement unit is ``equal toor better than'' the displacement dwelling.

While it need not possess every feature of the displacement dwelling,the principal features must be present.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For example, if the displacement dwelling contains a pantry and asimilar dwelling is not available, a replacement dwelling with ample kitchencupboards may be acceptable. Insulated and heated space in a garage mightprove an adequate substitute for basement workshop space. A dining areamay substitute for a separate dining room. Under some circumstances, atticspace could substitute for basement space for storage purposes, and viceversa. Only in unusual circumstances may a comparable replacement dwellingcontain fewer rooms or consequentially less living space than the displacementdwelling. Such may be the case when a decent, safe, and sanitary replacementdwelling (which by definition is ``adequate to accommodate'' the displacedperson) may be found to be ``functionally equivalent'' to a larger butvery run-down substandard displacement dwelling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.2(d)(7) requires that a comparable replacement dwellingfor a person who is not receiving assistance under any government housingprogram before displacement must be currently available on the privatemarket without any subsidy under a government housing program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A public housing unit may qualify as a comparable replacement dwellingonly for a person displaced from a public housing unit; a privately-owneddwelling with a housing program subsidy tied to the unit may qualify asa comparable replacement dwelling only for a person displaced from a similarlysubsidized unit or public housing; a housing program subsidy to a person(not tied to the building), such as a HUD Section 8 Existing Housing ProgramCertificate or a Housing Voucher, may be reflected in an offer of a comparablereplacement dwelling to a person receiving a similar subsidy or occupyinga privately-owned subsidized unit or public housing unit before displacement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, nothing in this part prohibits an Agency from offering, orprecludes a person from accepting, assistance under a government housingprogram, even if the person did not receive similar assistance before displacement.However, the Agency is obligated to inform the person of his or her optionsunder this part. (If a person accepts assistance under a government housingprogram, the rental assistance payment under andSection; 24.402 would becomputed on the basis of the person's actual out-of-pocket cost for thereplacement housing.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.2(g)(2) Persons not displaced.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.2(g)(2)(iv) recognizes that there are circumstances wherethe acquisition of real property takes place without the intent or necessarythat an occupant of the property be displaced. Because such occupants arenot considered ``displaced persons'' under this part, great care must beexercised to ensure that they are treated fairly and equitably. For example,if the tenant-occupant of a dwelling will not be displaced, but is requiredto relocate temporarily in connection with the project, the temporarily-occupiedhousing must be decent, safe and sanitary and the tenant must be reimbursedfor all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with thetemporary relocation, including moving expenses and increased housing costsduring the temporary relocation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is also noted that any person who disagrees with the Agency's determinationthat he or she is not a displaced person under this part may file an appealin accordance with andSection; 24.10.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.2(k) Initiation of negotiations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section of the part provides a special definition for acquisitionsand displacements under Pub. L. 96-510 or Superfund. These activities differunder Superfund in that relocation may precede acquisition, the reverseof the normal sequence. Superfund is a program designed to clean up hazardouswaste sites. When such a site is discovered, it may be necessary, in certainlimited circumstances, to alert the public to the danger and to the advisabilityof moving immediately. If a decision is made later to permanently relocatesuch persons, those who had moved earlier would no longer be on site whena formal, written offer to acquire the property was made and thus wouldlose their eligibility for a replacement housing payment. In order to preventthis unfair outcome, we have provided a definition which is based on thepublic health advisory or announcement of permanent relocation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.3 No duplication of payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section prohibits an Agency from making a payment to a personunder these regulations that would duplicate another payment the personreceives under Federal, State, or local law. The Agency is not requiredto conduct an exhaustive search for such other payments; it is only requiredto avoid creating a duplication based on the Agency's knowledge at thetime a payment under these regulations is computed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.9(c) Reports.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph allows Federal agencies to require the submission ofa report on activities under the Uniform Act no more frequently than onceevery three years. The report, if required, will cover activities duringthe Federal fiscal year immediately prior to the submission date. In orderto minimize the administrative burden on Agencies implementing this part,a basic report form (see Appendix B of this part) has been developed which,with only minor modifications, would be used in all Federal and federally-assistedprograms or projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Real Property Acquisition</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.101(b) Less-than-full-fee interest in real property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This provision provides a benchmark beyond which the requirementsof the subpart clearly apply to leases. However, the Agency may apply theregulations to any less-than-full-fee acquisition which is short of 50years but which in its judgment should be covered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.102(d) Establishment of offer of just compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The initial offer to the property owner may not be less than the amountof the Agency's approved appraisal, but may exceed that amount if the Agencydetermines that a greater amount reflects just compensation for the property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.102(f) Basic negotiation procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is intended that an offer to an owner be adequately presented,and that the owner be properly informed. Personal, face-to-face contactshould take place, if feasible, but this section is not intended to requiresuch contact in all cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.102(i) Administrative settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section provides guidance on administrative settlement as analternative to judicial resolution of a difference of opinion on the valueof a property, in order to avoid unnecessary litigation and congestionin the courts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All relevant facts and circumstances should be considered by an Agencyofficial delegated this authority. Appraisers, including reviewing appraisers,must not be pressured to adjust their estimate of value for the purposeof justifying such settlements. Such action would invalidate the appraisalprocess.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.102(j) Payment before taking possession.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is intended that a right-of-entry for construction purposes beobtained only in the exceptional case, such as an emergency project, whenthere is no time to make an appraisal and purchase offer and the propertyowner is agreeable to the process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.102(m) Fair rental.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 301(6) of the Uniform Act limits what an Agency may chargewhen a former owner or previous occupant of a property is permitted torent the property for a short term or when occupancy is subject to terminationby the Agency on short notice. Such rent may not exceed ``the fair rentalvalue * * * to a short-term occupier.'' The Agency's right to terminateoccupancy on short notice (whether or not the renter also has that right)supports the establishment of a lesser rental than might be found in alonger, fixed-term situation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.103(a) Standards of appraisal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In paragraph (a)(3) of this section, it is intended that all relevantand reliable approaches to value be utilized. However, where an Agencydetermines that the market approach will be adequate by itself becauseof the type of property being appraised and the availability of sales data,it may limit the appraisal assignment to the market approach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.103(b) Influence of the project on just compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As used in this section, the term ``project'' is intended to meanan undertaking which is planned, designed, and intended to operate as aunit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the public knowledge of the proposed project, propertyvalues may be affected. A property owner should not be penalized becauseof a decrease in value caused by the proposed project nor reap a windfallat public expense because of increased value created by the proposed project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.103(e) Conflict of interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The overall objective is to minimize the risk of fraud and mismanagementand to promote public confidence in Federal and federally-assisted landacquisition practices. Recognizing that the costs may outweigh the benefitsin some circumstances, andSection; 23.103(e) provides that the same personmay both appraise and negotiate an acquisition, if the value is $2,500or less. However, it should be noted that all appraisals must be reviewedin accordance with andSection; 24.104. This includes appraisals of real propertyvalued at $2,500, or less.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.104 Review of appraisals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This section recognizes that Agencies differ in the authority delegatedto the review appraiser. In some cases the reviewer establishes the amountof the offer to the owner and in other cases the reviewer makes a recommendationwhich is acted on at a higher level. It is also within Agency discretionto decide whether a second review is needed if the first review appraiserestablishes a value different from that in the appraisal report or reportson a property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Before acceptance of an appraisal, the review appraiser must determinethat the appraiser's documentation, including valuation data and the analysesof that data, demonstrates the soundness of the appraiser's opinion ofvalue. The qualifications of the review appraiser and the level of explanationof the basis for the reviewer's recommended or approved value depend onthe complexity of the appraisal problem. For a low value property requiringan uncomplicated valuation process, the reviewer's approval, endorsingthe appraiser's report, may satisfy the requirement for the reviewer'sstatement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.106 Expenses incidental to transfer of title to the Agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Generally, the Agency is able to pay such incidental costs directlyand, where feasible, is required to do so. In order to prevent the propertyowner from making unnecessary out-of-pocket expenditures and to avoid duplicationof expenses, the property owner should be informed early in the acquisitionprocess of the Agency's intent to make such arrangements. In addition,it is emphasized that such expenses must be reasonable and necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_General Relocation Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.204(a) Availability of comparable replacement dwellingbefore displacement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This provision requires that no one may be required to move from adwelling without one comparable replacement dwelling having been made available.In addition, andSection; 24.204(a) requires that, ``Where possible, threeor more comparable replacement dwellings shall be made available.'' Thusthe basic standard for the number of referrals required under this sectionis three. Only in situations where three comparable replacement dwellingsare not available (e.g., when the local housing market does not containthree comparable dwellings) may the Agency make fewer than three referrals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.205 Relocation assistance advisory services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(C) is intended to emphasize that if the comparablereplacement dwellings are located in areas of minority concentration, minoritypersons should, if possible, also be given opportunities to relocate toreplacement dwellings not located in such areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.206 Eviction for cause.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Basic eligibility for assistance is established on the basis of factsexisting as of the date of the initiation of negotiations. Once the Agencyhas determined that a person has satisfied such requirements there is nobasis for changing that determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.207 General requirements_claims for relocation payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.207(a) allows an Agency to make a payment for low costor uncomplicated moves without additional documentation, as long as thepayment is limited to the amount of the lowest acceptable bid or estimate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Payment for Moving and Related Expenses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.307 Discretionary utility relocation payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.307(c) describes the issues which must be agreed to betweenthe displacing agency and the utility facility owner in determining theamount of the relocation payment. To facilitate and aid in reaching suchagreement, the practices in the Federal Highway Administration regulation,23 CFR, Part 645, Subpart A, Utility Relocations, Adjustments and Reimbursement,should be followed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart E_Replacement Housing Payments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.401 Replacement housing payment for 180-day homeowner-occupants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provision in andSection; 24.401(c)(4)(iii) to use the current fairmarket value for residential use does not mean the Agency must have anappraisal made. Any reasonable method at arriving at the fair market valuemay be used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provision in andSection; 24.401(d) set forth the factors to be usedin computing the payment that will be required to reduce a person's replacementmortgage (added to the downpayment) to an amount which can be amortizedat the same monthly payment for principal and interest over the same periodof time as the remaining term on the displacement mortgages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In any case where the person elects to obtain a replacement mortgageof a lesser amount than the one computed in the buydown determination,then the amount computed as the ``buydown'' payment must be adjusted toreflect the change in mortgage amount. This can be done through prorationby dividing the amount of the actual replacement mortgage by the computedeligible replacement mortgage amount. This calculation provides a percentagefactor which can then be applied to the computed ``buydown'' amount resultingin an adjusted increased mortgage interest payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.402 Replacement housing payment for 90-day occupants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The downpayment assistance provisions in andSection; 24.402(c) are intendedto limit such assistance to the amount of the computed rental assistancepayment for a tenant or an eligible homeowner. It does, however, providethe latitude for Agency discretion in offering downpayment assistance whichexceeds the computed rental assistance payment, up to the $5,250 statutorymaximum. This does not mean, however, that such Agency discretion may beexercised in a selective or indiscriminate fashion. The displacing agencyshould develop a policy which affords equal treatment for persons in likecircumstances and this policy should be applied uniformly throughout theAgency's programs or projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For purposes of this section, the term downpayment means the downpaymentordinarily required to obtain conventional loan financing for the decent,safe, and sanitary dwelling actually purchased and occupied. However, ifthe downpayment actually required of a displaced person for the purchaseof the replacement dwelling exceeds the amount ordinarily required, theamount of the downpayment may be the amount which the Agency determinesis necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.404 Replacement housing of last resort.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 24.404(c)(2) permits the use of last resort housing, in specialcases, which may vary from the usual standards of comparability. However,it should be specially noted that such variation should never result ina lowering of housing standards nor should it ever result in a lower qualityof living style for the displaced person. The physical characteristicsof the replacement dwelling may be dissimilar to those of the displacementdwelling but they may never be inferior.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One example might be the use of a new mobile home to replace a verysubstandard conventional dwelling in an area where comparable conventionaldwellings are not available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another example could be the use of a superior, but smaller decent,safe and sanitary dwelling to replace a large, old sub-standard dwelling,only a portion of which is being used as living quarters by the occupantsand no other large comparable dwellings are available in the area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 24.404(b) Basic rights of persons to be displaced.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph affirms the right of a 180-day homeowner-occupant,who is eligible for a replacement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix B to Part 24_Statistical Report Form</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This appendix sets forth the statistical information collected fromAgencies in accordance with andSection; 24.9(c).</ITAG>General<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Report coverage. </T3>This report covers all relocation and real propertyacquisition activities under a Federal or a federally assisted projector program subject to the provisions of the Uniform Relocation Assistanceand Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended by Pub.L. 100-17, 101 Stat. 132.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Report period. </T3>Activities shall be reported on a Federal FiscalYear basis, i.e., October 1-September 30.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Where and when to submit report. </T3>Submit an original and two copiesof this report to (<T3>Name and Address of Federal Agency</T3>) as soon as possible afterSeptember 30, but NOT LATER THAN NOVEMBER 15.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>How to report relocation payments. </T3>The full amount of a relocationpayment shall be reported as if disbursed in the year during which theclaim was approved, regardless of whether the payment is to be paid ininstallments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>How to report dollar amounts. </T3>Round off all money entries in PartsB and C to the nearest dollar.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Statutory references. </T3>The references in Part B indicate the Sectionof the Uniform Act that authorizes the cost housing payment under andSection;24.401, to a reasonable opportunity to purchase a comparable replacementdwelling.
