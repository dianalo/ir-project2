The Pentagon chief, who arrived here this morning for his firstNATO meeting since assuming office, told reporters he didn't expectto learn of Bush's decisions on those two critical issues until theend of the week.   Cheney said some of his own decisions about where to cut thePentagon's fiscal 1990 budget would depend on what the presidentdecided.   Bush is grappling with whether he can afford the type offinancial commitment to Star Wars made by former President RonaldReagan, and with whether the United States should build a smallmobile nuclear missile or place the giant MX missile on rail carlaunchers.   Congressional and administration leaders agree the United Statesneeds a mobile missile to better deter a Soviet attack, but not onwhich missile is best.   Cheney, appearing relaxed on his Air Force jet as he embarked onwhat he called his ``maiden voyage'' to NATO, refused Tuesday todiscuss his own recommendations to Bush.   But the Washington Post reported today that Cheney told Bush hefavors building a railroad-based version of the MX nuclear missileand scrapping the planned Midgetman missile.   Both weapons are designed as successors to the Minuteman, whichhas formed the heart of the nation's land-based atomic missileforce for two decades. The Pentagon has built 50 MX weapons fordeployment in silos in Nebraska and Wyoming.   If Cheney favors the rail-based MX over the Midgetman, he wouldbe taking the position long favored by the Air Force. The Midgetmanhas chiefly been supported by Democrats, who control Congress.   But the defense secretary acknowledged there were still sharpdivisions within the administration on how best to proceed and thatBush had received ``a wide range of opinions'' during a closed-doorNational Security Council meeting at the White House Tuesday.   ``Obviously, there are strongly held views within theadministration on these questions,'' Cheney said. ``And there aredifferent views within the administration on these questions.''   While Bush is still debating nuclee Pentagon's original 1990budget proposal by $10 billion.   Bush and congressional Democrats agreed last week on that cut,which will force the Pentagon to settle for a budget that fails tomatch the inflation rate. The new total for military spending is$305.5 billion.   While Cheney declined to discuss any of his specific budgetdecisions, an aide who demanded anonymity said the defense chiefplanned to kill the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey aircraft program andforce the Navy to accept a cut in its aircraft carrier fleet.   The V-22 is a high-tech ``hybrid'' aircraft that can take offlike a helicopter and fly like an airplane, thanks to engines thatswivel at the ends of its wings.   At a cost of more than $20 million per plane, however, ``Cheneyhas a hard time accepting this as a cost-effective way to carry 20Marines into combat,'' the aide said.   As for the NATO meeting, Cheney said it was important that thealliance proceed with modernizing its Lance short-range nuclearmissiles, now that all intermediate-range missiles had beenabolished by treaty with the Soviet Union.   But the defense secretary added he expected no final decisionsat this week's meeting on the timetable for replacing the Lance.   West Germany has expressed reservations about the issue,dividing the alliance by suggesting further arms-control talks withthe Soviet Union might obviate the need for modernizing the Lance.The issue is particularly sensitive in West Germany, since mostshort-range nuclear missiles are deployed there and would be usedthere in the event of war.</TEXT></DOC>
