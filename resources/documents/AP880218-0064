Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in a lengthy annual reportto Congress accompanying the president's fiscal 1989 budgetproposal, said the administration was living up to the bargain itmade with Congress last November setting new military spendinglimits.   Carlucci said the Pentagon believes the limits will force it``to accept greater risks than we think wise.''   ``We have done our best to apportion reductions in ways thatminimize those risks. We will reduce the size of our forces, butthe units we do field will have what they need to perform the tasksentrusted to them.''   Carlucci said the combined active-duty forces of the Army, Navy,Air Force and Marine Corps will be reduced gradually this year to2,138,000 and then held at that level throughout fiscal 1989 _which begins on Oct. 1.   That will represent a cut of about 34,000 active-duty positionscompared to the 2,172,000 that Congress authorized for this year,and a cut of 46,000 compared to the fiscal 1989 force the Pentagonhad planned.   ``Reductions will be accommodated through attrition and reducedaccessions (recruiting),'' Carlucci said.   The Air Force will diminish by roughly 23,000 to about 576,000.The Army will lose about 8,600 soldiers, dropping to about 772,000,while the Marine Corps will lose about 2,900 to about 197,000. TheNavy will hold steady at about 593,000.   In addition, the defense secretary said more than 10,000civilian jobs would be cut in fiscal 1989 _ leaving a total of1,102,000 worldwide _ but reserve strength would hold steady at1.17 million.   The administration's priorities are unchanged, Carluccicontinued.   The Pentagon wants $4.55 billion for the Star Wars missiledefense system compared to $3.55 billion this year; wants tocontinue work on a rail-mobile version of the MX missile; isrequesting $1.4 billion for another Trident nuclear submarine, andwants servicemen to receive a 4.3 percent pay raise instead of the2 percent planned for civilian government workers.   On the other hand, Carlucci said the Army will deactivate amotorized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Wash., and cancel thescheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in Alaska;the Navy will forego plans to stand up a 14th air wing at theMiramar, Calif., Naval Air Station and retire ships it wanted tokeep, and the Air Force will deactivate two fighter wings.   The fiscal 1989 budget totals for the Pentagon have been knownfor three months _ ever since the White House and Congress reachedagreement on a two-year, deficit-reduction package.   Under that compromise, $299.5 billion will be authorized formilitary programs in fiscal 1989 and $294 billion actually spent inoutlays. The difference represents authorized funding for long-termprojects and weapons buying in future years.   The fiscal 1989 total is an increase over the $291.4 billion inbudget authority approved for this year but is unlikely tocompensate for inflation. Carlucci complained that fiscal 1989 willbe the fourth consecutive year of ``negative real growth'' inmilitary spending.   The Pentagon had asked for authority to spend $332.4 billion infiscal 1989 before the deficit compromise was adopted _ meaningdozens of military programs had to be revised.   According to Carlucci, the result was that:</TEXT><TEXT>   _The Army will retire 450 aging utility helicopters and 170scout copters; cancel the Aquila surveillance drone program andstop production of Copperhead laser-guided artillery shells; canceldevelopment of the Anti-Tactical Missile, and develop only one newlight helicopter instead of two.   _The Navy will give up its goal of reaching a 600-ship fleet infiscal 1989, settling for 580. It will retire 16 frigates early;deactivate one Poseidon missile submarine that had been scheduledfor overhaul; kill its new blimp program, and cancel development ofa new model of the Intruder attack jet, the A-6F.   _The Air Force will deactivate the 474th Tactical Fighter Wingat Nellis Air Force Base and one other _ either the 401st Air Wingnow in Spain or another one if a new European home is found for the401st. It will reduce its operation of SR-71 surveillance jets,relying more on satellites; cancel development of the ASATsatellite-killer rocket, and delay certain space operations atVandenberg Air Force Base.   _Purchases of Air Force F-15's and Marine AV-8B jump jets willbe cut back.   Carlucci said he would recommend to Congress that it killdevelopment of the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile. Butthe Pentagon is requesting $200 million for the program in fiscal1989 to keep the missile alive long enough for the nextadministration to decide its fate, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
