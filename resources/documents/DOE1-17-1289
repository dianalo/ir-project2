By varying the isotope mass of the projectileions (/sup 35/Cl and /sup 37/Cl) and of the target atoms (/sup 112/Snand /sup 118/Sn) the radiation at scattering angles andgt;10/sup 0/ couldbe clearly identified as bremsstrahlung from the elementary scatteringprocess of the two nuclei. The intensity of the radiation emitted at0/sup 0/ and 90/sup 0/ relative to the beam direction can be reasonablywell described by a quantum mechanical calculation of nucleus-nucleusbremsstrahlung which includes the interference between dipole and quadrupoleradiation amplitude.</TEXT></DOC>
