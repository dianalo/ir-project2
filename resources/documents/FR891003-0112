(``PSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuantto section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule19b-4 thereunder,\1\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change to amend the PSE's Certificate ofIncorporation in order to eliminate, under limited circumstances, the personalliability of a member of the PSE's Board of Governor for monetary damagesarising from a breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a Governor to theExchange or its members. Additionally, the proposal sought to make fivetechnical amendments to the PSE Constitution.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1982) and 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The proposed PSE rule change was noticed in SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 25549 (April 6, 1988), 53 FR 12488. No commentswere received on this proposal. On October 3, 1988, the PSE submitted AmendmentNo. 1 to File No. SR-PSE-88-01. Amendment No. 1 added language that providesthat the proposed exemption from monetary damages for breach of fiduciaryduty by members of the PSE's Board of Governors would not be availableif the liability arose, directly or indirectly, as a result of a violationof Federal securities laws. On September 5, 1989, the PSE submitted Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-PSE-88-01which narrows the above proposed rule change by deleting all referencesto the Certificate of Incorporation, while maintaining the five proposedchanges to the PSE Constitution as the proposal's sole focus. The PSE explicitlystated that it plans to file a separate rule change containing an amendmentto its Certificate of Incorporation regarding Board of Governor liability.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-PSE-88-01. The proposed rule change would adopt five technical amendments to the PSEConstitution. The proposal will delete an obsolete transition provisionin Article II, section 7, that was drafted to govern the timing of theelection and the duties of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Exchange'sBoard of Governors for the period immediately following the effectivenessof amendments to the Constitution adopted in 1979. The proposal will alsoamend Article V, section 1, to reflect an increase in the number of authorizedmemberships from the current level of 516 by stating that it shall ``notexceed 552.'' This increase in the number of memberships was approved bythe Commission in April 1982.\4\<NOTE/> The proposal will amend Article VI, section 2, to clarifythat an application for membership must be made in accordance with RuleIX of the PSE Board of Governors and that, upon approval, the name of theapplicant will be posted with members of the Exchange. The proposal willalso amend Article VII, section 4, so that the payment of the purchaseprice for a PSE membership will only have to be made to the Exchange priorto the effective date for admission to membership rather than four daysprior to admission. Finally, the proposal will amend Article VIII, section4, to specify that the membership of every member of the Exchange who hasconferred his membership privileges on any firm shall be deemed to be anasset of such firm only to the extent necessary to protect claimants underArticle VII of the PSE Constitution as to the disposition of such proceeds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-PSE-87-5, approved in Securities Exchange ActRelease No. 24401 (April 29, 1987), 52 FR 16470. The Commission believes the proposed amendments to the PSE's Constitutionare consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulationsapplicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with therequirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act.\5\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that the five proposed amendmentsto the PSE Constitution are not substantive and simply eliminate obsoleteprovisions, update other provisions, and simplify and clarify various membershipapplication and payment procedures. In view of this, the Commission believesthese changes should be approved. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982). <T3>It Is Therefore Ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\6\<NOTE/> that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.\7\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 C.R.R. 200.30-3(a)(12) (1989). <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 26, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
