Fund</HL><DATE>04/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><CO>   LATAM EUROP</CO><LP>   Self-proclaimed progressives have held that the interestsof the poor are best served by socialism, and that it is onlybecause of capitalist manipulation and deception that workerseverywhere did not &quot;unite and throw off their chains.&quot; Thattheory has crashed into the brick wall of reality with therecent elections in Nicaragua, East Germany and Hungary. Ineach country, it was the working-class areas that mostemphatically rejected socialism and voted for free-marketparties.   The first socialist country to throw Marxism into thedustbin of history in fully free elections was Nicaragua inFebruary. It is true that UNO, the opposition coalition thatdefeated the ruling Sandinista regime, was made up of 14parties whose views ranged from free-market to far left. Itseconomic platform, however, called for free markets andprivatization.</LP><TEXT>   The election results published in Barricada, theSandinista newspaper, show the depth of the repudiation theparty suffered in areas it had long considered its own.   As expected, the Sandinistas turned out their loyal votersin the capital of Managua. Middle-class areas filled withhomes that had been confiscated for use by governmentloyalists voted for the Sandinistas. Many of the city's poorbarrios, however, rejected them. &quot;In Monsonor Lezcano, UNOwon two to one,&quot; Barricada reported mournfully. In workingclass San Judas, a Sandinista stronghold, UNO nearly won. Theday after the vote, Reuters reported, barrio residents burnedthe Sandinista flag in the streets.   The isolated southern area along Nicaragua's Caribbeancoast is probably the poorest region in the country. It gaveUNO more than 60% of the vote, its second-highest result inany region. By way of contrast, the Rio San Juan areabordering Costa Rica, perhaps the richest in Nicaragua, gavethe Sandinistas 58% of the vote and their best showing.   In the area where the most severe contra fighting tookplace, around Matagalpa and Jinotega, the Sandinistas claimedvoters would give them a landslide victory to express theiroutrage at the U.S.-backed contra war. Instead, UNO won 58%of the vote, the Sandinistas only 36%.   Nicaragua's results should have prompted Western observersto question media reports from East Germany that claimedvoters wanted to retain large elements of socialism. CarlBernstein, writing in Time magazine in January, said he&quot;could hardly find any citizens who said they wanted areunified, single Germany.&quot; He reported that &quot;they love theircountry. The German Democratic Republic, not the FederalRepublic of the West. They believe in socialism. Still.&quot;   Mr. Bernstein could file this amazing dispatch onlybecause his interviews were done in East Berlin, the one partof East Germany that clearly resisted the free market tide infavor of rapid unification. The reform Communist Party won30% of the vote in Berlin and the leftish Social Democrats(SPD) and Alliance 90 another 41%. In the rest of thecountry, the parties of the left won only 36% of the vote.The high Berlin vote for the left reflected the high numberof Communist Party functionaries, court intellectuals andpolicemen in the capital.   Some Western analysts have attributed the conservatives'victory to their supposedly massive rural support, but theresults indicate otherwise. Conservatives ran behind the votefor the parties of the left in the most rural regions of thecountry.   But the conservatives triumphed in the densely populatedindustrial areas of Thuringia and Saxony, the prewarheartland of German socialism. The left won only 26% of thevote in the Dresden district, and in the soot-begrimedindustrial region of Karl Marx Stadt, only 29%. Erfurt, wherethe Social Democratic Party issued its political program in1891, gave the SPD only 19% of the vote.   The Social Democrats did poorly in part because manyworkers harbored bitter memories of the years during whichthe West German Social Democrats cooperated with theCommunist regime of Erich Honecker. &quot;As time went on, the SPDcame to identify helping East Germans with helping theCommunist Party,&quot; bricklayer Olaf Wohlleben told John Barnesof the Detroit News. Overall, exit polls showed that 60% ofworking-class voters plumped for the conservatives and whatWest German pollster Wolfgang Hartenstein called West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl's &quot;petit bourgeois certainties.&quot;   Support for those same values dominated Hungary'selections last week. The two leading parties, DemocraticForum and the Free Democrats, disagree only on how rapidly tomove to a market economy. Together they won nearly half thevote. The Socialists and Communists won a total of 15% andwere swamped by the pro-market Free Democrats, even in thepoorer areas of Budapest.   Despite this sweeping repudiation of socialism, it wouldbe an exaggeration to say a majority of people in thesecountries have become convinced capitalists. People arevoting not only for a different political and economicsystem, but also to make their societies less political. WhenLech Walesa visited the Journal last November, he was askedwhat the Polish people wanted. &quot;We want to rejoin the ranksof normal societies,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn't an issue ofideology, it simply means we want a system where politicsisn't everything and people can live normal lives.&quot;   Having lived in countries where every aspect of life fromuniversity exams to child care was politicized, voters inEastern Europe and elsewhere are embracing a little-heraldedfeature of the free society -- the freedom not to be obsessedwith political questions. They can instead immerse themselvesin family, career, church or self-improvement. In normalsocieties people may forget about politics and concentrate onthe serious business of living. Socialism even in its mostbenign form is a bureaucratic committee meeting that neverends.   ---   Mr. Fund is an editorial writer for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
