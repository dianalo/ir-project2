The evaluation was carried on the basis of the rate constants ofthe removal of H by atomic hydrogen from molecules of ethane, ethene,n-hexane, and 1-hexene. The rate constants for these reactions were determinedfrom the results of the pyrolysis of ethane, ethene, n-hexane, and 1-hexenewith the addition of propene labeled on the central C atom (C=C*-C, whereC* = {sup 14}C).</TEXT></DOC>
