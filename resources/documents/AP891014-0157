Sir Peter Hall's production of Shakespeare's ``The Merchant ofVenice'' was the lone smash hit in an otherwise lackluster summerfor British drama. It opened June 1 at the Phoenix Theater for a13-week run that was extended through Sept. 23.   Hoffman as Shylock was a risky venture. It wasn't just aquestion of ironing the New York inflections out of Hoffman'svoice, but of how the fastidious British theater-going public wouldtake to a Hollywood star attempting Shakespeare.   ``I didn't quite know what it would be like. All I knew is Iwould learn something,'' Hoffman said.   Explaining the mixed reviews, he blamed the speed with which theproduction was rushed onto the stage, due to his father's illness,which forced him to spend time at his bedside in the United States.   ``We opened in this play after 10 public performances, and myperformance for me was like those incisions you see from peoplewho've been operated on,'' he said in an August interview.   ``You still see their fresh wounds and their stitches; now I'mat a point where you can barely see the scars.''   Shylock is the Jewish moneylender whose thirst for revengeagainst Antonio (Leigh Lawson), the Venetian merchant of the title,finds its match in the exactingly legalistic heiress, Portia(Geraldine James).   Hall, who directed the play, said that as an authenticallyJewish actor, Hoffman ``changed the part historically.''   ```Merchant' seemed to me particularly right for him,'' Hallsaid in an interview. ``Shylock is about the outsider, the mancoming into the society which he is foreign to, which was very muchDustin's situation coming into an English theater company.''   Assessing Hoffman's achievement toward the end of the Londonrun, Hall said: ``Shylock is wheeling and dealing and surviving,and that's what Dustin seizes hold of. To me, he answers thequestion, is Shylock comic or tragic, by saying he's both; he's aman.''   The Shylock character traditionally provokes the accusation thatShakespeare was anti-Semitic, and anyone involved in staging ``TheMerchant of Venice'' knows how sensitively it must be handled.   ``To have a Jewish actor play Shylock is mandatory in our age,''said Hall. ``If you're going to talk about Jewishness, you'd betterdo it from a position of integrity and knowledge, not ham acting.''   Some of the play's success may have been due to renewedenthusiasm for Shakespeare. But the real draw undoubtedly wasHoffman, fresh from his second Academy Award for ``Rain Man,'' in aplay that marked both his British and his Shakespearean stage debut.   Hoffman, who grew a beard for the show and shaved it off afterthe last performance, eschewed above-the-title billing and appearedhalf way down the cast list.   But despite such modesty, the mixed reviews and a top ticketprice of 17.50 pounds ($28), expensive by London standards, theplay quickly sold out. Only the London mega-musicals such as``Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Aspects of Love'' sold as manytickets.   The play starts New York performances Dec. 4 at the 46th St.Theater, with an opening on Dec. 19.   Hall recalled that Hoffman first thought of playing Hamlet, butwas judged too old at 52. Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night,'' anotherpossibility, was shelved for want of a suitable Viola. The two thenhit on Shylock, one of Shakespeare's most controversial parts andalso surprisingly small in light of its importance. Shylock appearsin only five scenes.   A planned out-of-town tryout in Bath was canceled because ofHoffman's father's illness, and Hoffman's performance had to evolveduring the run. The opening, said co-star Geraldine James, was``very rushed.''   ``Dustin hit his peak in the middle of the run,'' she said in aninterview. ``He hadn't got the confidence at the beginning ... andI think he might have gone too much the other way (towards theend), playing too much into the audience.''   She said she found his attitude anything but starry. ``He was sogenerous, spiritually and literally; he wouldn't have his name overthe title and insisted on me having the last curtain call.''   Julia Wilson-Dickson, the production's dialogue coach, admiredHoffman as ``a fanatical worker, a seeker after the truth ... butperhaps a little more free in his enthusiasm'' than most Britishactors.   It fell to her to turn his ``dawg'' into ``dog,'' and ``bawnd''into ``bond,'' and his performance over time got ``simpler, morestraightforward, and physically stronger vocally,'' she said in aninterview.   ``The actual conception of it is exactly the same, but thepractical delivery has been honed greatly.''   Could Hoffman tackle other Shakespeare parts? ``Absolutely,''Wilson-Dickson said. ``I've told him so about 50 times _ and he'sdefinitely humble enough to ask.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, Oct. 18</NOTE></DOC>
