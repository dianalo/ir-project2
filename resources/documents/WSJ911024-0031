The software maker said that with the lifting of U.S.economic sanctions in July and South Africa's own attempts todismantle its system of apartheid, &quot;the continuation ofsanctions would do more harm than good.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Lotus implemented its own sanctions in 1985 but hadn'tpreviously sold goods in South Africa.   Lotus is one of a handful of companies to establish tiesin South Africa since the U.S. lifted sanctions, saidJennifer Kibbe, senior analyst at the Investor ResponsibilityResearch Center, in Washington, D.C. No company has made adirect investment, owning 10% or more of an activesubsidiary, since sanctions were lifted, she added.   Lotus said it &quot;eventually expects to create a wholly ownedsubsidiary in South Africa that would bring jobs andadditional technical training to the region, as well as serve{as} the hub of Lotus's operations throughout the region.&quot;   Ms. Kibbe said that would take Lotus &quot;a step further thananyone else.&quot;   Lotus said it will begin distributing its core products,including its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, business graphics andword-processing software, immediately through two SouthAfrican distributors, Computer Horizons and a black-ownedconcern called HNR.   A Lotus spokesman said that some shareholders, includingstate and municipal pension plans, are prohibited fromholding stock in companies doing business with South Africa.However, he predicted they will be lifting those rules inlight of the U.S. action.</TEXT></DOC>
