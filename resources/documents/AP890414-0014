Gen. Prosper Avril has left the Haitian leader in astronger position to carry out his U.S.-backed program ofdemocratic reform and drug busting.   But events of the past two weeks exposed the continuing threatto stability posed by the impoverished Caribbean nation's poorlytrained and corruption-ridden army.   It is a question now of whether Avril, a former adviser to theDuvalier family dictatorship who became president in a militarycoup seven months ago, has the power and the will to fulfill hispledge of ``irreversible democracy.''   ``So far, all we have are his democratic promises,'' said aWestern European diplomat. ``Haitians have grown skeptical of suchpromises.''   Diplomats said the trigger for the April 2 coup attempt wasAvril's dismissal the previous week of four army colonels accusedof drug running. Loyal troops rescued the president as he was beingdriven, handcuffed, to the airport to be deported.   The government said the plot was hatched by former Haitianinterior minister and longtime Avril foe, Roger Lafontant, wholives in the neighboring Dominican Republic, and other exileslinked to Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled into exile inFrance in February 1986.   Four officers _ not those dismissed earlier _ were identified asringleaders: Col. Guy Francois, commander of the 750-man DessalinesBattalion; Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the 400-man LeopardsCorps; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of the 1,100-manPresidential Guard; and Col. Qualo Leonce, an administrativeofficer and godson to Lafontant.   Avril deported Rebu, Biamby and Leonce to New York, where theywere detained by U.S. immigration officials, and Francoissubsequently was given asylum by the Vatican Embassy inPort-au-Prince.   No sooner had Avril escaped the coup attempt than the Leopardsand Dessalines rebelled. Loyalist troops crushed the mutiny in atwo-day assault on the Dessalines barracks, adjoining the NationalPalace. The Leopards ended their revolt with no further fighting.   Defeat of the Dessalines Battalion, the army's second biggestunit and traditional maker and breaker of Haitian presidents, wouldappear to remove one of the most serous threats to Avril'sauthority.   The battalion, widely regarded as the most repressive andcorrupt in the army, was previously led by Col. Jean-Claude Paul,who was indicted on drug charges in Miami and died last November,reportedly after drinking poisoned soup.   ``Nobody has been as powerful as Avril is now,'' said PierreRaymond Dumas, a prominent Haitian author and military expert.   He said Avril still faces the task of training the army into adisciplined force. ``What we have is an armed gang, not a realarmy.''   During their 29-year rule, Jean-Claude and his father, Francois``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971, corrupted the officerscorps and encouraged rivarly among units. They promoted zealotsregardless of merit and created a private militia of thugs known asthe Tonton Macoute.   Avril has fired or forced into retirement more than 140 officerssince coming to power in a Sept. 17 coup led by noncomissionedofficers preaching democracy and respect for human rights.   He has partially restored the 1987 constitution _ suspended byhis predecessor, the tyrannical Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy _ andapproved the establishment of an electoral council to organizeelections of a civilian government.   Democratic reform and a crackdown on drug trafficking are amongconditions set by the United States for restoring $70 million inaid suspended after the abortive elections of November 1987 inwhich thugs supported by the army massacred 34 voters at pollingstations.   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley said the prospects fordemocracy are good, provided Avril ``can hold together and continueto move toward the goal of elections.''   Although human-rights organizations have accused Avril ofcontinued abuses, U.S. officials have said they are satisfied withprogress he has made in moving toward democracy.   ``I expect that within weeks the State Department will announcea resumption of aid,'' said Larry Birns, director of theWashington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which has beencritical of U.S. policy on Haiti.   ``I'm extremely skeptical about Avril as a person, but thiswhole affair may force him to accelerate democratization, becausehe needs U.S. aid,'' Birns said.   Avril ``now realizes that without a civilian political base heis vulnerable to coups. He will likely speed up the democraticprocess, not out of any noble cause, but for his own survival.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Pierre Glass, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico,has covered Haiti for The Associated Press since 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
