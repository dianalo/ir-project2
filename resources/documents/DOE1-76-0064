The total radiation doses are distinguished in externaldoses, received from the air and ground, and internal doses, receivedby inhalation and ingestion. The effective dose-equivalents from externalradiation are calculated from (averaged) measurements of radioactivityconcentrations in the air and on the ground. For the calculation of effectiveradiation dose-equivalences from inhalation and ingestion three age categoriesare distinguished: adults, 10-year and 1-year old childs, according toinhalation rate and food parcels. The calculations of effective radiationdose-equivalences received in the period May/June 1986 are based onlyon measured contaminations of food. For latter periods also uptake ofradionuclides from the soil into the plants and further into the foodchain are taken into account. 16 refs.; 26 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
