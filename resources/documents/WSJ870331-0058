Tisch, chairman and chief executive officer of Loews Corp., is spending so much time running CBS Inc. that Loews is reducing his salary.    The employment agreement between Loews and Mr. Tisch, who is also president and chief executive of CBS, called for annual compensation of $750,000. But according to Loews's most recent proxy statement, Mr. Tisch's contract was amended as of Feb. 16 to reduce his salary to an annual rate of $200,000 for &quot;so long as he is devoting a principal amount of his time to CBS.&quot;    Furthermore, the proxy statement says, CBS reimbursed Loews for $262,540 in salary and benefits for the services of Mr. Tisch between Sept. 11, 1986, and Jan. 14, during which time he served as acting chief executive of CBS.    Mr. Tisch, who was elected president and chief executive of CBS Jan. 14, receives an annual salary of $750,000 from CBS.    CBS is a broadcasting, record and publishing concern. Loews is a real estate, tobacco and insurance company. </TEXT></DOC>
