The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern said Wednesday it chosePhilips over two other contenders for the job of making andinstalling 300,000 television sets, 16,000 videocassette recordersand 8,000 satellite dishes at participating schools.   The contract award came on the heels of Turner BroadcastingSystem Inc.'s launch earlier this week of a daily commercial-freenews program tailored for schools on its Cable News Network.   The Turner program, called CNN Newsroom, is being deliveredwithout the huge donation of equipment that Whittle plans to provide.   The contract with Philips, a subsidiary of North American PhilipsCorp., which in turn is a unit of the Dutch conglomerate PhilipsIndustries NV, is the company's largest single order of this type.   The other contenders were Japan's Sony Corp. and VideostarConnections, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.'s Electronic DataSystems Corp.   Atlanta-based Videostar had supplied, installed and serviced thehardware for Whittle's 25-show Channel One test in six schools lastspring.   Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle said Philips won the jobbecause of a combination of ``service and price'' but declined tospecify just what separated the three bids.   He said his company would borrow from banks to pay for theequipment, which is Whittle's largest single undertaking to date.   Whittle Communications, which is 50 percent owned by Time WarnerInc., reported revenue of $152 million for the year ended June 30.   Philips said it plans to start building color Magnavox brand TVsets for the project at its Greeneville, Tenn., plant later thisyear. It expects to add more than 200 manufacturing employees at thefacility.   Philips has contracted with RSI-SatCom Technologies Division ofDuluth, Ga., to manufacture the satellite dishes and install andservice the TV sets, VCRs and satellite systems in the schools.   Whittle expects to have 1,000 schools hooked up when it launchesChannel One nationally in March 1990 and hopes to have 8,000 schoolsby the end of 1990.   Asked how many schools have signed up to date, Whittle said hedid not intend to give a running total but said signup efforts wouldbegin in earnest with the start of the school year.   He also declined to say which advertisers have signed up for theprogram. During the test run last spring, each Channel One programcarried two minutes of ads for jeans, sneakers, candy bars, shampooand other products.   The advertising has outraged some national education groups, whosay companies should not be allowed to pitch products to students inthe classroom.   The New York State Board of Regents banned Channel One from thestate's public schools because of the ads and the top educationofficial in California said public schools that run Channel Onethere risk losing some state aid.   But Whittle said there is no other realistic way besides sellingadvertising time to pay the $2 million weekly cost of both producingthe news show and equipping schools to see it.</TEXT></DOC>
