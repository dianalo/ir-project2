Dow Jones last week agreed to boost its stake in Telerate Inc. to 56% from 45% by using commercial paper to finance the purchase of $303.1 million of Telerate stock from another holder. While the purchase will boost debt, Sandamp;P said, Dow Jones's &quot;excellent cash-generating assets, and a conservative financial management, should allow financial measures to return to levels fully supportive of the rating within a few years.&quot; Sandamp;P's affirmation affects a $150 million shelf filing by Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Telerate provides computerized financial data.    ---   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE INC.: Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on the Dothan, Ala.-based hospital chain and health care provider's $30 million in 14.5% subordinated debentures to Caa from single-B-2. Moody's cited increased financial leverage, reduced prospects for debt reduction through asset sales and expectations of &quot;minimum profitability.&quot; The company may be forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing because its creditor banks, to which the company owes $114 million, probably won't extend the waiver of financial covenants granted through Sept. 30, the rating agency said. Moody's said industrywide problems for rural hospitals, including inadequate Medicare reimbursement, have been exacerbated at National Healthcare by the large number of facilities -- many of which were unprofitable -- the company recently acquired. National Healthcare declined comment.    ---   NU-MED INC.: Moody's lowered its rating on the senior subordinated debentures of Nu-Med to single-B-3 from single-B-1. The ratings agency cited the health care services concern's failure to make $7.8 million in interest payments due last Tuesday on two debenture issues. The issues include $49.2 million outstanding of 13 3/4% senior subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1995 and $52.6 million outstanding of 13 1/2% senior subordinated sinking fund debentures due 2005. A spokesman for Encino, Calif.-based Nu-Med declined to comment.    ---   SOUTHLAND CORP.: Moody's lowered the ratings on about $800 million of long-term securities of Southland and its Southland Canada Inc. unit. The rating concern said it downgraded Southland's senior debt rating and the rating on Southland Canada's guaranteed Eurobonds to single-B-1 from Baa-1. It also lowered Southland's preferred stock rating to single-B-3 from Baa-2 and its rating on commercial paper to Not Prime from Prime-2. It cited Southland's &quot;very high leverage, modest cash flow coverage for debt, and Moody's expectation that net losses will be incurred for several years&quot; because of heavy interest costs related to its leveraged buy-out. Southland's founding Thompson family is leading a $4 billion leveraged buy-out of the convenience store retailer, which owns and operates 7-Eleven stores. A spokesman for Southland said the company wasn't concerned about the downgrades because the preferred stock, senior debt and commercial paper are absorbed in the buy-out transaction and will be replaced by new securities. Moody's assigned initial ratings to the proposed offerings, covering about $1.5 billion in securities. It assigned a single-B-2 rating to Southland's proposed senior subordinated notes and subordinated debentures, a single-B-3 rating to its proposed junior subordinated payment-in-kind debentures, and a single-B-3 rating on its proposed issue of 30 million shares of exchangeable cumulative preferred stock. The ratings on the proposed offerings &quot;are very realistic in (the) situation. We're perfectly happy with them,&quot; the Southland spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
