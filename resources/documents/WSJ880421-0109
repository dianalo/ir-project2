Separately, Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A. boosted its friendly offer for Irving by $10 a share, to $75 a share, but cut the number of shares it is offering to buy to 8.5 million, a 45% stake, from 9.5 million, or 51%. The new offer increases the value of the bid by $20 million, to $637.5 million.    The New York Fed's action puts increased pressure on Irving in its bid to fend off the Bank of New York, which is offering $15 cash and 1.575 shares of Bank of New York for each of the 17.6 million shares outstanding, or 95%, of Irving that it doesn't own. Bank of New York's offer is valued at about $64 a share, or $1.08 billion. The bank reiterated yesterday that it doesn't plan to increase its offer. On Saturday, a proxy fight by Bank of New York for control of Irving's board is expected to reach its climax at Irving's annual meeting, with some analysts predicting victory for Bank of New York.    Bankers said the New York Fed's rejection reflected concern that the bank, which had a loss of $193 million last year, should be replenishing its capital instead of boosting dividends. The Fed declined comment.    Irving on Monday said it planned to raise its annual per-share common dividend by 86%, to $4.50 from $2.42. Nevertheless, an Irving spokesman said it is &quot;decidedly possible&quot; that Irving will pay the higher dividend in May if its financial performance warrants it. &quot;The Fed just doesn't want us to commit to paying it now. We fully expect our results will allow us to pay it.&quot; Bankers and analysts said that Irving needed a big dividend increase to help bolster the market value of its shares that would remain in public hands if Banca Commerciale's offer is accepted. A concern of Irving holders is that the value of the shares not tendered to Banca Commerciale would plummet if the deal is completed.    Analysts said that the revised offer by Milan-based Banca Commerciale reflected investors' unenthusiastic reception to the original offer announced Monday. However, investors and securities analysts generally remained unimpressed. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving closed at $61, up 25 cents.    Commenting on the New York Fed's rejection, Irving's general counsel, Robert Falise, said, &quot;We didn't check the dividend increase out with the Fed. We ran the increased dividend through the Fed's capital guidelines based on our forecasted (improved) earnings. Based on our calculations we met the guidelines. Obviously, we're not going to pay a dividend that is in violation of the Fed's capital guidelines.&quot;    Apparently, the Fed didn't subscribe to Irving's arithmetic. Late Tuesday, according to Irving executives, the New York Fed phoned to direct them not to increase the dividend. An Irving spokesman said the Fed didn't address a special $10-a-share dividend that Irving has proposed to pay through asset sales if Banca Commerciale's offer succeeds. He added the Fed could address that if the need arises.    Last year, Irving boosted its reserves for doubtful loans to Latin American countries by $450 million. That move sliced Irving's common equity ratio to 3.4% of assets in this year's first quarter from 4.2% a year earlier. The Fed wants banks to maintain common equity levels of at least 4% to insure against any sudden shocks to the financial system.    James J. McDermott Jr., research director of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said he was &quot;shocked&quot; by the magnitude of Irving's planned 86% dividend increase. He added that the hefty dividend was a major factor in Irving's estimates that its residual shares would trade at $45 to $60 a share. Bank of New York estimated that the market value of residual Irving shares would be $10 a share less than Irving has stated.    Virginia Adair, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said of Banca Commerciale's revised offer: &quot;It's muck. There are a lot of loose ends to it. It's very difficult to quantify this offer. I tend to think that Bank of New York's offer will succeed.&quot;    In Italy, some analysts were surprised that Banca Commerciale wanted to expand to the U.S. when most European banks are concentrating on strengthening operations on the Continent. In 1992, banks from the 12-nation European Community will be allowed to operate in any member country under the laws of their home country.    Banca Commerciale officials characterized the Irving bid as &quot;a good deal&quot; but stressed that its success wasn't essential for the Milan bank's expansion plans.    ---   Laura Colby in Rome contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
