Ltd.andP;  The personal-computer market isthe second largest segment with 1.5 million units sold per year, followed bydedicated office processors with 0.5 million units, and engineeringworkstations with 0.3 million units.andM;&quot;The Japanese market is very segmented&quot;, says Makoto Naruke, senior managerat Microsoft in Tokyo.andP;  He predicted that OS/2 would grab the lion's share ofthe office-processor market--some 90 percent--and that the personal-computerarena would remain a DOS market.andP;  According to Naruke, the engineeringworkstation sector will be dominated by UNIX, but he then adds that when theextended version of OS/2 is put on the market in the middle of next year, itwill pose strong competition.andM;Though OS/2 is still relatively new to the market in Japan, a determinedeffort is under way to make it a standard.andP;  Eleven major companies led byNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) recently joined forces tochallenge NEC Corp.'s domination of the otherwise fragmented Japanesepersonal-computer market by creating an OS/2 driver standard in Japan.andM;The alliance constitutes the second major market threat NEC has faced in thelast two years and, like the first, it springs from internationally prevalentIBM standards.andP;  Over a year ago, the joint Architecture Extended (AX) effortby more than 100 Japanese companies resulted in a Japanese/English, IBM PCAT-compatible computer standard for the Japanese market.andM;While the AX effort was aimed at filling the time-to-market gap between thephase-out of the AT's popularity and the positioning of the PS/55 models (theJapanese version of the PS/2, based on new technology), the OS/2 effortaggressively addresses Japan's chronic lag in native-language softwaredevelopment and the country's race to compete in the fast-growing 32-bitpersonal-computer market.andM;Few AX computers have been put on the market as yet, and the few that havebeen don't offer a wide enough range of application programs to make thempopular, according to one industry observer.andP;  And, as it turns out, thePS/55s are making their market debut sooner than expected.andM;Microsoft Japan's president, Susumu Furukawa, has predicted that OS/2products will be widely used in Japan by 1992.andP;  One reason for thetechnology's rapid adoption is the effort of the OS/2 group--whose membershiplist is like a Who's Who in the Japanese PC industry--to assure customersthat OS/2 application programs will run on multiple manufacturers'PS/55-compatible computers.andP;  This has not been the case in the JapaneseMS-DOS market, where every computer manufacturer has bundled its ownproprietary version of the operating system with its machines.andM;Unlike the AX effort that preceded it, the OS/2 standards group has aready-made market: NTT reportedly will purchase 30,000 OS/2-based computersannually, starting next year, for internal use and for sale to othercompanies.andP;  BecauseNTT doesn't manufacture its own products, but insteaddesigns them and subcontracts their production, the company is viewed byother vendors as one of their largest customers in the world.andP;  Groupparticipants will be able to sell their products on the open market as well.andM;NTT Data Communications, a subsidiary of the giant telecommunicationscompany, started the OS/2 project.andP;  The company wanted to ensure thathardware from a wide range of manufacturers would be available for itssystems-integration activities, and therefore favored the development ofstandard OS/2-based computers, according to project members.andM;&quot;Because of its hard experience with [incompatible versions of] MS-DOS[running on different vendors' hardware], the company required us to havecommon interfaces for OS/2&quot;, says Tatsuzumi Furukawa, general manager ofFujitsu Ltd.'s research and planning division in Kawasaki, Japan.andP;  NTT Data'sconcern, he says, was that if every company created its own version of OS/2,there would be too many versions for independent software developers tocontend with.andP;  &quot;It's hard to ask software companies to port programs to manydifferet machines.andP;  That is very expensive.&quot;andM;NTT Data took the lead in establishing specifications for the OS/2-compatiblePCs that it plans to distribute to its many branches in Japan and to theMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications, which oversees NTT's activities.andO;Microsoft's Naruke says NTT held 50 meetings concerning the specificationover a six-month period in its own offices, received several ideas from thestandardization group's member companies, and finally wrote 90 percent of thespecification internally.andP;  He adds that NTT has some 200 people working onthe development of OS/2 products.andM;NTT held its first meeting concerning the OS/2 standard with Fujitsu, oneofNTT's traditional suppliers, in December 1988, Naruke explains.andP;  In March1989, the company offered other vendors the opportunity to participate in theproject.andP;  NTT and Fujitsu were joined by Hitachi, Microsoft, IBM Japan,Matsushita, Sharp, Mitsubishi, Sanyo, Oki, and Toshiba.andM;NEC, a major Japanese PC supplier reportedly in the process of devising anOS/2 standard of its own, has not joined the NTT group.andP;  &quot;NEC has beenworking on OS/2, but it doesn't like to have a standard because the companydominates the marke&quot;, Fujitsu's Furukawa says.andP;  NEC holds the largest shareofthe Japanese MS-DOS marke (50 percent), followed by Matsushita, Fujitsu, andIBM Japan.andM;The NTT-initiated OS/2 standard will cove hardware-specific aspects of OS/2needed to handle special Kanji ideograph displays and keyboards.andP;  It alsowill enable Japanese OS/2 application programs to run on machines fromdifferent manufacturers that would otherwise be considered incompatible.andP;  Thedriver standard will be defined for basic OS/2-based computers that are builtaround Intel Corp.'s 386 CPU and use OS/2 Version 1.1.andP;  The specificationsfor the standard were scheduled to be completed in late October 1989, andwill be in the public domain.andM;Naruke explains that the hardware-dependent OS/2 specifications are notdescribed in the original version of OS/2, though the application programinterface is defined by IBM and Microsoft.andP;  &quot;US OEMs don't care about thehardware-dependent part [of an operating system] because computers in theUnited States are 100 percent IBM-compatible&quot;, he says.andP;  &quot;But in Japan, thereare so many different hardware standards that we need our ownhardware-dependent part.&quot;andP;  The hardware-dependent specification definesbackground colors for the display as well as screen-type features, such asboldface and underlining.andP;  It also supports two-byte Kanji ideographs.andP;  Hesays the software will be 99 percent IBM-compatible, and that the hardwareneed not be IBM-compatible.andP;  Naruke estimates that 50,000 OS/2 programs hadalready been sold by the end of August 1989.andP;  But he adds that these OS/2versions, not based on any standard drivers, are not yet compatible.andM;Furukawa of Fujitsu adds that many OS/2 programs are still being tested inthe market--evidently, the operating system's use is not yet widespread.andP;  Heexpects OS/2 to become more popular in Japan when OS/2 Extended Edition,which includes a LAN manager and database features, comes to market, becauseit will then be better suited to the needs of companies with large numbers ofend users.andP;  He says it will be easy to upgrade the OS/2 standard to bring itin line with OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;Still, Larry Crume, president of ATandamp;T UNIX Pacific in Tokyo, believes thatUNIX will fare well in Japan, despite consolidated efforts by Japanesecompanies to open up the market on the MS-DOS and OS/2 fronts.andP;  The AXproject was not as successful as expected, he says, because Japanesemanufacturers still want to keep their own proprietary Kanji input methods.andO;There is no real standard in Japan for inputting Kanji ideographs becauseevery computer manufacturer tries to effect a unique approach.andP;  Crumepredicts that an attempt to standardize the OS/2 driver will suffer a similarfate for the same reason.andM;According to Crume, in order to accommodate all the different input methods,they would have to be coded into device drivers, written into the applicationprograms themselves, or put into data-stream modules.andP;  Because OS/2 does nothave the capability for streams, uniting the input methods in OS/2 would bevery difficult, he says.andP;  UNIX System V has such streams, and can thereforerun different input methods.andM;Aside from being burdened with technical difficulties, Crume contends, anystandards movement in Japan faces opposition for two main reasons: first, themarket demonstrates a propensity toward proprietary systems; second, Japaneseusers and manufacturers still do not fully recognize the merits of opensystems.andM;This is likely to change, however, as soon as US hardware manufacturers beginslashing prices in Japan to gain market share.andP;  So far, American companieshave boosted their Japanese prices 50 to 100 percent higher than their USprices.andP;  Crume predicts they will eventually chop their profit margins andbegin discounting and underselling established Japanese hardware suppliers.andO;This trend will come on the heels of the system-integrator boom in Japan.andO;Recently, Crume says, many companies have entered the system-integrationbusiness, performing all the packaging and customization normally done bymanufacturers.andM;&quot;With US makers' chip margins, Japanese companies will have to go to opensystems to survive&quot;, Crume anticipates.andP;  &quot;System integrators here are lookingfor low-priced pieces to provide an end-user solution, and they will gooverseas to get parts.andP;  Japanese companies have proprietary systems that arehigh-priced, so they will not be able to respond as well.&quot;andM;Even so, standards-setting will remain an uphill battle in Japan.andP;  &quot;If weexplain the benefit of open systems, people here understand,&quot; says MikioTanaka, vice president of Japanese operations of X/Open Co. Ltd., in Tokyo.andO;&quot;But it's a different story to get Japanese users to switch to open systemsfrom proprietary ones.&quot;andM;Tanaka predicts that proprietary and open systems will coexist for about tenyears, after which open systems will dominate the Japanese market.andP;  &quot;Theperception of open systems in Japan is not fully developed now&quot;, he explains.andO;&quot;Japanese vendors would like to sell proprietary systems to end users.andP;  Butthis is not [the best] end-user solution.andP;  So Japanese companies willcontinue to have both proprietary systems and open systems.&quot;andP;  He adds thatJapanese open-systems efforts have been aimed at overseas markets, wherestandardized systems proliferate.andM;One reason Tanaka and his X/Open colleague Toru Yoneda continue to faceroadblocks in promoting the open-systems concept is the long-standing closerelationship that has existed between large Japanese customers and theirvendors.andP;  Suppliers have traditionally helped their users write customsoftware fitted both to applications and to the hardware vendor's system.andO;&quot;Japanese customers are not as independent as those in the United States&quot;.andO;Tanaka explains.andM;Since the X/Open office began operations in Tokyo last February, Tanaka andhis staff of three have been able to attract only a handful to shareholders:Fujitsu (the first Japanese company to join--even before the officeofficially opened), Hitachi, and NEC.andP;  Each company paid the annualshareholder's fee of 70 million yen.andP;  In addition, a number of Japanesecompanies--including Yokogawa Hewlett-Packard, Nihon Unisys, IBM Japan, andNihon Digital Equipment Corp.--participate in Japan's X/Open concern becausetheir US affilitates belong to X/Open.andM;Despite the small membership, Tanaka remains optimistic.andP;  The three companiesthat have committed to X/Open are leading computer vendors in Japan, whichprovides the organization with a channel to many end users.andP;  Tanaka saysX/Open has hopes of attracting more supporters by establishing a new class ofparticipants below the shareholder level in the coming months.andP;  Such playerswill pay less but in return will have fewer rights to the fruits of X/Open'slabor.andM;How wide a swath UNIX can cut in the Japanese market remains in question,particularly where the personal-computer arena is concerned.andP;  Tanaka predictsthat UNIX will likely remain an operating system used in specialized domains,notably the engineering workstation market.andM;&quot;It is very difficult for UNIX to penetrate the personal-computer market&quot;,Tanaka says, &quot;but UNIX has a chance in the workstation area.&quot;andP;  With regard tospecialized applications markets in which high-end PCs and low-endengineering workstations are equally acceptable platforms, he says that thepreferred operating system will be chosen according to the number ofapplications available to run on it.andP;  to date, there are no X/Open-brandedproducts in Japan, but Tanaka expects there will soon be programs availablefrom US and European software houses to which Japanese distributors will addKanji characters.andM;X/Open's Yoneda, also a Hitachi employee, explains that market demandprompted Hitachi to adopt both OS/2 and Unix.andP;  Hitachi has two virtuallyidentical workstations: the model 2020 supports MS-DOS and OS/2, and sellsmore than its sibling, the UNIX-based model 2050.andP;  One reason for thecompany's leaning toward OS/2 is that Hitachi's large computers arecompatible with IBM 370 mainframes.andM;Beyond choosing an operating system, the question of whether to buy anengineering workstation or a terminal or PC is topmost in users' minds aswell.andP;  Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. is now in the first year of three-year programto build an international computer-aided design network that will link itsautomotive design centers by satellite.andP;  The network, powered by tow Craysupercomputers, is aimed at speeding up vehicle development by means ofultra-fast transmission of design and development data between the centers.andM;As part of its automation drive, Nissan wants each of its 3000 engineers tohave his or her own workstation.andP;  It currently has two graphics terminals forevery three engineers.andP;  The company is now evaluating what types of graphicsworkstations it should attach to the network.andP;  Given that each of its carshas some 30,000 components, Nissan needs considerable horsepower in order toeffect rapid engineering changes.andP;  Still, some design work can be handled ongraphics terminals, and Nissan may buy a mixture of workstations, terminals,and PCs, according to company spokesman Ryo Akiyama.andM;In addition to the efforts of large companies to prepare operating systemsfor niche markets, smaller companies are packaging their operating systemsfor even narrower market segments.andP;  For example, Digital Research Inc. hastaken a vertical-market approach in Japan, providing different operatingsystems for different applications, according to DRI president Dick Williams.andO;DRI's contention is that a fixed standard stunts the growth of the industry,and that market applications are so broad now that one operating systemcannot meet everyone's needs.andM;The company is aiming its DR DOS operating system at IBM clone-makers,value-added PC suppliers, and enterprises that can use the operating systemwith embedded systems in pocket computers or applicances, for example.andO;Williams says its FlexOS product is being used in industrial automation,point-of-sale systems, and transaction-processing applications.andP;  The companyhas ported FlexOS to NEC's V60 microprocessor, in addition to Intel chips.andO;Users of DRI operating systems include Fujitsu and Sharp--which use thesoftware in their point-of-sale systems--and Fanuc, which uses it in roboticscontrollers.andP;  &quot;We do more work in unique OEM implementations in Japan thanelsewhere.andP;  We are very committed to the Japanese market&quot;, says Williams, a22-ear veteran of IBM.andM;An area of potential growth for DRI is the multimedia/interactive-videomarket, where Japanese manufacturers already have a technological edge.andP;  DRIis looking at ways to make use of real-time FlexOS on computers that mustmanage multiple data streams--in applications where, for example, audio andvideo information needs to be downloaded into a computer system from a videodisk.andP;  Like other software vendors, DRI is hoping to use a traditional USstrength--software development--to get a leg up in Japan's potentiallylucrative, but to date somewhat elusive, computer market.andM;Lori Valigra, UNIX REVIEW's correspondent in Japan, filed this report fromTokyo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
