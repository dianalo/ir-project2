MichaelDukakis, meanwhile, acknowledged he had suffered a setback, buttold supporters: ``The sweetest honey is made only slowly.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt, whose third-place finish in Michigan mayhave dealt a fatal blow to his Democratic bid, spent Sunday withhis family deciding what his next move would be. If the Missouricongressman wants to seek re-election to his House seat, he mustfile by Tuesday afternoon.   Gephardt scheduled a Washington news conference Monday afternoonto announce his plans. Aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,had already said a loss in Michigan would finish his campaign.   Jackson asserted that his Michigan showing had put new punchinto an already-powerful campaign.   ``It was the message of the soul and authenticity of JesseJackson versus money and technology _ and the people prevailed,''Jackson told supporters at an airport news conference in New York'sWestchester County. ``It's a campaign of hope ... that willcontinue to win and grow.''   But Dukakis said it was too soon to say how the Democratic raceis shaking out.   ``Anyone that thinks that this race is over or even that it'snarrowed down to a two-person or a three-person race doesn'tunderstand the unpredictability of American politics,'' saidDukakis, who had hoped to seal an image of ``inevitablity'' with aMichigan win. ``There are no front-runners.''   Jackson ran well across Michigan, but racked up enormousmajorities in Detroit. In one of the city's congressionaldistricts, Jackson's victory margin was better than 12-1. Overall,he outpolled Dukakis by a nearly 2-1 margin.   The civil rights activist quickly turned to the nextbattleground, heading for Connecticut, which holds its primary onTuesday.   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,Jackson had 107,689 or 55 percent to 55,337 or 28 percent forDukakis. Gephardt had 24,995 or 13 percent. Sen. Paul Simon had4,069 or 2 percent, and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 3,818 or 2 percent.   When Jackson got word of his Michigan victory, he was alreadycampaigning in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on April 5. Astatewide poll being published in Monday's Milwaukee Sentinelsuggested Jackson and Dukakis were in a dead heat in the state.   The poll indicated Dukakis had the backing of 28 percent ofDemocratic respondents, while Jackson had 27 percent, and another22 percent were undecided. Simon had 10 percent, Gephardt 8 percentand Gore 3 percent. The margin of error in the telephone survey,conducted March 17-22, was 5 percentage points.   Dukakis was in Wisconsin when he heard the Michigan results. Heflew home to Boston, then started stumping again in Connecticut.   ``This is a long race,'' he told backers in New Haven on Sundayat a Greek celebration. ``We'll have good days and not-so-gooddays...but this race is only half over.''   Dukakis was looking ahead to races like the New York primary onApril 19, with 255 delegates at stake. A poll published Sunday inthe New York Daily News indicated he was the clear favorite,trailed by Jackson.   The Daily News poll had Dukakis favored by 45 percent of theDemocrats surveyed, to 29 percent for Jesse Jackson. None of thethree other active Democratic candidates was favored by more than 6percent of the voters who participated in the survey.   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.   The Massachusetts governor won precinct caucuses in NorthDakota, which was just beginning its process of selecting 15delegates to the national Democratic conventions. And he also waswinning Iowa's county conventions, the latest step in that state'scomplicated delegate-selection process.   But Dukakis has been trying to break away from the rest in thenational delegate count, and Jackson's Michigan victory _ whichnetted him a plurality of delegates from the state _ left him hoton Dukakis' heels.   In the latest AP delegate count, Dukakis had 603.55 to Jackson's597.55. Gore had 362.8, Simon 171.5, Gephardt 167 and uncommitted362.6.   Gore and Simon did not seriously contest the Michigan caucuses,staking their hopes instead on the Wisconsin primary.   Gore was in Connecticut Sunday, suggesting Dukakis'disappointing finish could help him by keeping the race ``wideopen.''   ``We're building momentum steadily...we're gaining speed,'' hesaid said after a speech at an Italian-American club in theindustrial city of Derby. ``This race has a long way to go. It iswide open, even more so after the results in Michigan.''   Simon, stressing his ties to Wisconsin, attended services Sundayat a church in the tiny community of Zachow, where his late fatherwas ordained as a Lutheran minister 62 years ago. Simon latertraveled to a site where his grandparents once farmed, then to afamily reunion with some of his cousins.   Gephardt, who has spent the last two years campaigning, had saida ``Michigan miracle'' could rejuvenate his campaign, which had astrong start in Iowa but has since racked up a string of losses.   ``We haven't decided anything,'' Gephardt said. ``We're going togo home and have a family meeting.'' On Sunday afternoon, spokesmanMark Johnson said no decision had been made.   But signs were pointing to a quick exit. A Missouri state partyleader, state Rep. Anthony D. Ribaudo, said he had spoken withGephardt Saturday night, and said Gephardt indicated he would runfor his House seat.   ``Dick Gephardt has informed me he'd like to proceed with hiscareer in Congress,'' Ribaudo said.   Gephardt could file for his House seat, however, and still keephis presidential campaign alive in some form for the time being.   Sen. Bob Dole, who has conceded he has little chance of gettingthe GOP nomination, had no campaign appearances Sunday. He wasgiving a speech on Monday in Washington on the future direction ofthe Republican Party.   Vice President George Bush was in California Sunday, taking aday off. He planned to spend at least three days campaigning inWisconsin this week.   Pat Robertson, who trails far behind Bush and Dole, had nocampaign appearances scheduled this week.</TEXT></DOC>
