The FY1986 investigation resultsof the wind power system with the output set on 1 MW are as follows.For the rotor, employment of a tectered hub was examined. This systemproved to be effective for reduction in the fluctuation width of a bladeload, which enables a small-size and light-weight blade attachment andhub to be employed. The blade strength and rigidity, which is requiredunder wind variation, was analyzed, giving a prospect of the productionmethod. The material, anti-corrosion method, snow covering, etc. of theblade were examined. Further, the relationship between the monopole diameterand the resonance wind velocity was analyzed. For the equipments in thenacelle, a variable pitch control actuator was examined. The axial systemincluding the blade and the hub was resonance analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
