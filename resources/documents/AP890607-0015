Aveni Jr.,who asked that his department be identified only as being in CamdenCounty, N.J.   The notion that policemen favor ``gun bans as a solution toviolent crime'' is wrong, said Aveni, who recently organized a groupcalled Law Enforcement for the Preservation of the Second Amendment,which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms.   ``The majority of us have taken an oath to uphold theConstitution,'' he said in an interview. ``The Second Amendment'sthe cornerstone of the Constitution. If the Second Amendment goes,there's no guarantee that the rest of the Constitution will remainintact. ... Without arms, people are powerless to dissent againstany kind of tyranny or repression of government.''   Aveni was one of the 225 officers flown to Washington by theNational Rifle Association to participate in a news conferenceTuesday and lobby their respective congressmen and senators. Theonly state not represented by an officer was Hawaii.   They were here to combat the impact of gun-control endorsementsby law enforcement officials such as Los Angeles Police Chief DarylGates and Baltimore County Police Chief Neil Behan, who are pushingfor controls on assault-style weapons including semiautomaticversions of the AK-47 and Uzi.   Law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include theNational Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association ofChiefs of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the NationalAssociation of Police Organizations and the Police ExecutiveResearch Forum.   ``For thousands of us out there that the chiefs, the appointedofficials, do not speak for the law enforcement officers that are inthe field, in the trenches, doing the job,'' said Patrolman RayMaples, president of the Memphis Police Association.   But Stephen Brown, counsel to the National Fraternal Order ofPolice, countered that his organization speaks for 200,000 of thoseofficers, not for their bosses.   ``The Fraternal Order of Police does speak for the cop on thestreet,'' Brown said. ``There are no chiefs, there are no sheriffs.They don't speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat.''   The contention by some law enforcement leaders that theirofficers are being ``outgunned'' by criminals wielding assault-styleweapons ``offends me,'' Officer Leroy Pyle of the San Jose, Calif.,Police Department said at the news conference.   Santa Monica, Calif., Officer Gary Steiner said criminals havebetter firearms because they're making more money these days.   ``Unfortunately, police departments have for many years beenforced to look at the bottom line in terms of low bid, and thatapplies to our safety equipment in particular,'' Steiner said.   Cincinnati Police Lt. Harry Thomas said many of the officersattending were ``under direct orders from their police chiefs todisassociate themselves from their respective police departments''in their comments.   ``The remarks that are made here should not be construed as theofficial policy of our respective police departments,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
