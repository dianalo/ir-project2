Poindexter, Marine Lt. Col.Oliver L. North, and arms dealers Richard V. Secord and AlbertHakim.   The Tower commission, in its Feb. 26, 1987, report to PresidentReagan, depicted North as a backstage manipulator who carried outboth the arms sale to Iran and the diversion of profits to theContra rebels in Nicaragua in an ``unprofessional'' manner thatinvited kickbacks and scandal.   The Tower commission said Poindexter, a vice admiral who firstwas the deputy national security adviser and later held the toppost in the National Security Council, ``failed grievously'' toconsider the gravity of the diversion of proceeds from the armssale to the Contras.   Poindexter ``apparently failed to appreciate or ignored theserious legal and political risks presented,'' the Tower panelsaid. ``His clear obligation was either to investigate the matteror take it to the president _ or both. He did neither.''   It said North ``conducted the operation through Mr. (Richard)Secord and his associates, a network of private individuals alreadyinvolved in the Contra resupply operation.''   ``North cut himself off from resources and expertise within thegovernment'' and relied on private businessmen and brokers with``questionable credentials and potentially large personal financialinterests in the transactions. This made the transactionsunnecessarily complicated and invited kickbacks and payoffs.''   ``The use of Mr. Secord's private network in the Iran initiativelinked those operators with the resupply of the Contras,threatening exposure of both operations if either became public.The result was a very unprofessional operation,'' the Tower reportsaid.   The Tower panel said that on one or more occasions, Poindextermay have misled Secretary of State George P. Shultz about theinitiative.   The report quoted North as once saying, ``it's going to be justfine ... as soon as everyone knows that ... the Ayatollah ishelping us with the Contras.''   The report said North ``misrepresented his access to thepresident and attributed to the president things the presidentnever said'' during October 1986 meetings in Frankfort, WestGermany, with Iranian representatives.   North reportedly told the Iranians that Reagan had said hewanted an end to the Iran-Iraq war on terms acceptable to Iran, andthat the Persian Gulf states had to be convinced Saddam Husain ofIraq was ``causing the problem.''   Reagan told the Tower commission those statements were``absolute fiction.''   The report said North once threatened the president of CostaRica with a cutoff of $80 million in U.S. aid if he publicized theexistence of a secret Costa Rican airfield used to resupply therebels.   Secord, who retired from the Air Force as a major general in1983 and became a private arms dealer, controlled Swiss bankaccounts under the name of Lake Resources into which $20 million inprofits from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran were placed, theTower report said.   Hakim is an Iranian immigrant and naturalized American who wasSecord's business partner in Stanford Technology Trading Group, aVienna, Va., company. Hakim helped open the channel ofcommunications to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran.   The House-Senate Iran-Contra committees in their report lastNov. 18 faulted Reagan for allowing a ``cabal of zealots'' to seizecontrol of foreign policy and skirt the law.   The report said that even when North became skeptical that thearms sales would free U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon or leadto a new relationship between the United States and Iran, ``hebelieved that the prospect of generating funds for the Contras was`an attractive incentive' for continuing the arms sales.''   ``The decision to designate private parties _ Secord and Hakim _to carry out the arms transactions had other ramifications,'' thecommittees reported. ``First, there was virtually no accounting forthe profits from the arms deals. Even North claimed that he did notknow how Secord and Hakim actually spent the money committed totheir custody. ...   ``Second, by permitting private parties to conduct the armssales, the administration risked losing control of an importantforeign policy initiative.''   The committees determined that of the $16 million in profitsfrom the arms sales, $3.8 million was earmarked for the Contraswhen the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to theNicaraguan rebels was in effect in 1985 and 1986.   The congressional committees said: ``In the Iran-Contra affair,administration officials holding no elected office repeatedlyevidenced disrespect for Congress' efforts to perform itsConstitutional oversight role in foreign policy.''   They called North ``the central figure in the Iran-Contraaffair,'' but emphasized he ``did not act alone. ... North'sconduct had the express approval of Admiral John Poindexter.''</TEXT></DOC>
