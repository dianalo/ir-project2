Hosker, Senior StaffVeterinarian, Domestic Programs Support Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, Room 815,Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road Hyattsville, Maryland 20782, (301)436-8438.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The ``Tuberculosis'' regulations (contained in 9 CFR Part 77 and referredto below as the regulations) regulate the interstate movement of cattleand bison because of tuberculosis. The requirements of the regulationsconcerning the interstate movement of cattle and bison not known to beaffected with, or exposed to, tuberculosis are based on whether the cattleand bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as accredited-free states,modified accredited states or nonmodified accredited states. The criteriafor determining the status of states (the term state is defined to meanany state, territory, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico) or portionsof states are contained in a document captioned ``Uniform Methods and Rules_BovineTuberculosis Eradication,'' 1985 edition, which has been made part of theregulations by incorporation by reference. The status of either statesor portions of states is based on the rate of tuberculosis infection presentand the effectiveness of a tuberculosis control and eradication program.Before publication of this interim rule, Arkansas was designated in andSection;77.1 of the regulations as a modified accredited state. However, Arkansasnow meets the requirements for designation as an accredited-free state.Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing Arkansas from thelist of modified accredited states in andSection; 77.1 and adding it to thelist of accredited-free states in that section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Immediate Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that a situation exists that warrants publicationof this rule without prior opportunity for public comment. It is necessaryto change the regulations so that they accurately reflect the current tuberculosisstatus of Arkansas as an accredited-free state and thereby provide prospectivecattle and bison buyers with accurate and up-to-date information, whichmay affect the marketability of cattle and bison since some prospectivebuyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free states. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this ruleare impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions,there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective less than 30days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> We will consider comments that are postmarkedor received within 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>As soon as possible after the comment periodcloses, we will publish another document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>discussing the comments we receive and any amendmentswe are making to the rule as a result of the comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. Cattle and bison moved interstate are moved for slaughter, for use as breedingstock, or for feeding. Changing the status of the state of Arkansas mayaffect the marketability of cattle and bison from the state since someprospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison fromaccredited-free states. This may result in some beneficial economic impacton some small entities. However, based on our experience in similar designationsof other states, the impact should not be significant. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3> et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. (See 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V.) <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 77 </ITAG>Animal diseases, Bison, Cattle, Transportation, Tuberculosis.
