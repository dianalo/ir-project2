The status of the Canadian wind energyresearch development and demonstration programs is outlined in this paper.The R andamp; D program focuses its activities on the development and improvementof medium scale wind turbines for grid connection (150 kW, 350 kW and500 kW) that incorporate innovative concepts such as external frame supportfor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), hinged blades, flexible strutsand tapered blades. The development of wind/diesel systems is also atop priority for the Canadian government. The installation and operationof two wind/diesel test beds and related activities are described. TheDepartment is also responsible for two demonstration programs; the RemoteCommunity Demonstration Program and the Enerdemo Program under whichseveral wind demonstration projects are being implemented. One of thekey areas is to demonstrate the benefit of using wind energy in dieselpowered grids.</TEXT></DOC>
