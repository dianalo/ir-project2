PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> VENICE  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nedis Tramontin, the best gondola-builder in Venice, is apologetic.    &quot;We have been making gondolas here for only 500 years,&quot; he says. &quot;The old boatyard was over there.&quot; He points in the general direction of St. Mark's Square.    Gondolas are made in dark, litter-strewn boatyards, called &quot;squeri,&quot; far off the tourist track. The gondola-builders -- the &quot;squeraroli&quot; -- have been in this line of work since the 11th century.    The gondola evolved as we know it today in the 15th century. It is instantly recognizable, quintessentially Venetian. It is always 36 feet long and five feet wide. It always weighs, rigged out, 1,600 pounds. And each gondola is built by hand, without blueprints, in 280 pieces of oak, fir, walnut, cherry, elm, mahogany, larchwood, white pine and limetree.    Gondolas are built in squalor. But when they finally take to the water after 50 days in the boatyard, they are beautiful.    &quot;Without gondolas,&quot; says the 65-year-old Mr. Tramontin, &quot;what is Venice?&quot;    Once, 15,000 gondolas plied the canals of Venice. Guardi and Canoletto filled their canvases with them. Wives of great Venetian aristocrats, sovereigns of the seas, conducted not-so-discreet affairs inside their little curtained cabins, trusting household gondoliers to look the other way. Ordinary Venetians went to their weddings in special festival gondolas (and, later, to their funerals in special black boats).    Now, with motorboats churning up and down the narrow canals, just 320 gondolas are left. &quot;We worry that one day pretty soon there will be no more,&quot; says Sergio Vazzoler, Venice's public-service commissioner and, on the side, the president of the Gondola Preservation Society. &quot;We aren't making enough new gondolas to replace the old ones that are wearing out.&quot;    Last year, Mr. Tramontin and his 32-year-old son, Roberto, made just three new gondolas (they do a bigger business repairing and restoring old ones). There are two other squeri still operating, and between them they built six or seven new gondolas. So, fix annual gondola production (AGP) at 10. &quot;It isn't enough,&quot; says Commissioner Vazzoler.    To increase AGP, Mr. Vazzoler proposes to build a gondola museum that would contain a school to train new squeraroli. A possible site is the Tramontin boatyard.    &quot;The men are growing old,&quot; says Mr. Vazzoler. &quot;We must send an SOS -- save our squeri -- and preserve the skills of the squeraroli and pass them along soon, or it will be too late.&quot; All he needs is the money, but that is hard to find in Venice, where so much needs repair and restoration.    Roberto Tramontin is the youngest squerarolo in Venice, and he hopes the training school ultimately will succeed. But he isn't terribly optimistic. &quot;Look at this place,&quot; he says, warming his hands over a wood fire in a rusty oilcan. Two dogs, wood shavings matted in their hair, are worrying a dead cat. Young Tramontin picks the cat up with a shovel and hurls the poor creature -- one of thousands of stray cats that make Venice their home -- into the canal.    &quot;It is hard work here,&quot; he says. &quot;It is a hard place. Young people like to work in offices or in the hotels or in restaurants. They like to be warm and comfortable. They don't want to come here.&quot;    Maybe, it is suggested, there is an easier way. What about Fiberglas gondolas? After all, he is reminded, somebody in Germany has built one.    &quot;Plastic!&quot; he shouts. &quot;Plastic gondolas!&quot; He calls to his father, explaining the suggestion in a rapid Venetian dialect. The elder Mr. Tramontin, whose grandfather was once gondola-maker to the king, rolls his eyes in elegant despair. He calls, in turn, to Romeo Crivellaro, a woodcarver, who has been chiseling a design into the bow of a new gondola. He explains the idea to Mr. Crivellaro. All three are now talking at once. They do not favor plastic gondolas.    &quot;You can only make gondolas with wood,&quot; says the elder Mr. Tramontin. &quot;You can't make them by pouring plastic into forms. Gondolas are made like a suit of clothes. They are made of wood to fit the gondolier -- one way if he's fat, another way if he's skinny.&quot;    Building a gondola is complicated business. &quot;It takes at least 13 years to learn how,&quot; says Roberto Tramontin. It starts with a permanent wooden base fixed to the floor of the shed. On this base, which contains marks indicating where the ribs are to be added, the boat is built.    Wet wood is shaped to fit the gondola by heating it over marsh-grass fires. The gondola is eventually turned upside down and the most-experienced squerarolo applies the finishing touch -- giving the bottom of the boat its special curvature from bow to stern. This craftsman -- the &quot;maestro d'ascia&quot; (the master of the ax) -- uses his eye to create the line. No plans, no blueprints. For a heavy gondolier, the platform at the stern of the boat from which he rows is raised just a little. For a lightweight gondolier, says the senior Tramontin, the maestro in this boatyard, &quot;we put the bow a little higher, the stern a little lower.&quot; The gondolier usually drops by to make sure the job is done properly.    The basic, economy-model gondola costs about $15,000. But even that is just the beginning. The oarlock -- the &quot;forcola,&quot; shaped a little like a muscular arm bent upright at the elbow -- is carved by hand from a solid chunk of walnut root and costs $400. The beechwood oar is $150 more. Figure another $1,000 for the chairs and cushions and the brass sea horses on the gunwales and the decorative brasses on the stern post.    The forcolas are so beautifully made they are now collected as sculpture. Giuseppe Carli for years was the best forcola-maker in Venice. But, at 76, he retired recently. &quot;That leaves me,&quot; says Romeo Crivellaro. &quot;But I am always No. 2 to Carli.&quot;    The final touch is the &quot;ferro,&quot; the shining bow ornament with the teeth. No one knows what the word gondola means, and no one knows what the ferro represents. Nedis Tramontin says the top of the heavy aluminum ornament represents the doge's cap. The six teeth, he says, represent the six municipal districts of Venice. No one else has a better explanation. A nice ferro costs $350. (The one item sadly missing from the modern gondola is the private little cabin. It made the boat too top-heavy to ride the motorboat waves.)    The real test, of course, is a ride in a new -- and, preferably, a new Tramontin -- gondola. There are fakes on the canals -- shabby, poorly maintained boats, sometimes the ones used to ferry people across the Grand Canal. So-called gondolas with little motors hidden beneath the platform where the gondolier is supposed to be rowing have also been spotted from time to time. And there are, of course, greedy and unscrupulous gondoliers.    But Roberto Peovesan is the real thing. His boat, Dona Tella, is fresh from the Tramontin squeri. The walnut forcola shines. The ferro is dazzling. Gondolier Peovesan is himself a sight to behold in his straw boater.    The gondola glides down cold and silent canals, Mr. Peovesan calling out a warning cry -- Hi-yea! -- as he approaches a watery intersection. The oar twists and turns with quiet precision in the forcola.    Venice without gondolas? &quot;Never!&quot; says Mr. Peovesan. </TEXT></DOC>
