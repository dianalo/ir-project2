Gorbachev isexaggerating his political problems _ warning of economic troubleand a possible coup against himself _ in a bid to consolidate hispower, some U.S. analysts say.   ``There has been a deliberate creating of a sense of crisis sothat he can undercut the conservatives,'' said Jerry Hough, ascholar of Soviet affairs at Duke University.   U.S. government analysts divide into two main camps onGorbachev's troubles, which stem from severe shortages of consumerand other goods and nationalist movements that have gained steamwith the relaxation of political controls.   Conservatives at the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agencyand some universities are warning the Bush administration thatGorbachev could fall victim to a conservative reaction, jeopardizingproposed agreements on arms control and human rights.   Those agreements will come under discussion on Thursday andFriday at a meeting in Wyoming between Secretary of State James A.Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   The conservative viewpoint has found an outlet in the speeches ofDefense Secretary Richard Cheney and public writings of PeterReddaway, a political scientist at George Washington University inWashington.   ``The Soviet Union is drifting toward a state of anarchy in whichit is going to be difficult to assert political control,'' saidReddaway.   However, the State Department and some analysts at CIA take amore moderate view, placing little credence in warnings of aconservative coup or predictions of a popular uprising againstGorbachev, such as that forecast by Soviet political maverick BorisN. Yeltsin in New York and Baltimore last week.   ``We tend to think that there has been a lot of hysteria, thatGorbachev is in a stronger position than the pessimists have beensaying,'' said one government official, espousing the moderate viewand speaking on condition of anonymity.   The administration, so far guided by the moderate view of Sovietpolitics, is moving to ``lock in some Soviet positions that we havenot seen before'' in arms control and human rights,'' said one StateDepartment source.   But the skeptics have the ear of President Bush, persuading himlast week to avoid an Oval Office meeting with Yeltsin, who hasemerged as Gorbachev's most prominent critic.   Yeltsin met instead with White House national security adviserBrent Scowcroft. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle stopped in for a15-minute chat with Yeltsin, but the White House did not release itscustomary photograph of the event.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater explained that theadministration did not want to provide Yeltsin a ``platform fordissidence.''   For the United States, Reddaway said in a recent interview, ``thebest policy is one of keeping very quiet.''   ``What is going to happen is rather unpredictable and the UnitedStates does not want to get branded with responsibility in any wayfor what is going on,'' Reddaway said.   Recent talk of a coup was kindled by Andrei D. Sakharov, theNobel peace laureate and member of parliament, who warned in anarticle published July 30 in the weekly Ogonyok that ``any tragicthing is possible.''   ``I think that a right-wing coup is possible ... A military coupis also possible in such a situation,'' Sakharov wrote.   Sakharov's remarks came on the heels of a Communist Party CentralCommittee meeting at which party stalwarts, whose authority has beenundercut by Gorbachev, expressed fears that the situation wasspinning out of control.   Gorbachev further fanned the fires in a speech Sept. 9 saying hefaced threats from both sides.   ``It is a fact that some people would like to create in thissociety an atmosphere of alarm, a feeling that there is no way out,a feeling of uncertainty,'' he said.   ``In this multi-voice choir, we can hear threats of approachingchaos and talk of a threatened coup, and even of civil war,''Gorbachev said.</TEXT></DOC>
