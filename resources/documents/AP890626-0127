A college official blamedright-wingers for the incident.   About 25 staff members at St. Barbabas College were treated fornasal irritation and West German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem ``gota good whiff'' of the foul-smelling substance, said Michael Corke,headmaster at the school in the Johannesburg suburb of Bosmont.   ``We suspect that right-wingers or other intolerant elements inour society were responsible for this vandalism,'' said Corke.``They are people who are anxious to disrupt the efforts ofresponsible groups working for social justice.''   Corke said there was an apparent connection between the sprayingof the weedkiller _ believed to contain cyanide _ and allegations bythe head of the South African Council of Churches of poisoning in anearlier incident.   The Rev. Frank Chikane, the council's general secretary, recentlywas hospitalized in the United States for the effects of poisoning,which he said may have been applied to his luggage before he leftSouth Africa.   The South African Press Association quoted a police spokesman,Col. Frans Malherbe, as saying the incident was being investigatedas malicious damage to property, but if poison were found, it wouldbecome an attempted murder investigation.   Chikane returned to South Africa last week to preside over thecouncil's 21st national conference. The church leaders met Mondaymorning with Bluem.   Before Bluem's entourage arrived at the college, Corke said ``atoxic and highly noxious liquid'' had been sprayed over the chapel.Corke said an examination of the substance ``by the head of ourscience school suggests that it is a cyanide-based insecticide orweedkiller.''   Corke said one element of the spray was ethnoic acid, which wasmostly vinegar, and another was possibly an insecticide.   Corke said he believed the vandals had gained access to thecollege chapel after 7:30 p.m. Sunday.   At his meeting with the church leaders, Bluem criticized thedelay and ``suppression'' of court cases connected with the killingsof anti-apartheid activists, and assured his hosts that the Bonngovernment would not make any new investments in South Africa.   But he said he was opposed to mandatory international economicsanctions, which church council leaders say would pressure thegovernment to end its apartheid laws.   Under South Africa's system of racial segregation, its 5 millionwhites control the economy and its 28 million blacks have no vote innational affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
