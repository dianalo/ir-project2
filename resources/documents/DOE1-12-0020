The maximum level of mutagenicactivity was observed in the base fraction from the waste-amended Bastropsoil. In the bioassay using S. typhimurium, the base fraction collectedimmediately after application from the Bastrop soil induced 77 net revertants/mgof extract, while the base fraction collected 540 days after waste applicationinduced 1561 net revertants/mg extract. Since the amount of extractablematerial decreased greatly over this period, degradation appears to havereduced the weighted activity of wood-preserving waste added to soil.The weighted activity, as measured with S. typhimurium strain TA98, ofthe neutral fraction from 1 g of waste-amended Norwood soil was reducedfrom 7322 net revertants immediately after application to 1541 net revertants1200 days after application. Major residual organic constituents in thesoil were tentatively identified by GC/MS/DS and included pentachlorophenol,trimethylnaphthalene, acenaphthylene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and cyclopentaphenanthrene.37 references, 1 figure, 5 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
