Nabisco's management said it would continue to work with itsinvestment adviser, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., on its own buyoutproposal.   In an advertisement appearing in the Wall Street Journal,Kohlberg Kravis said its offer was conditioned on Nabisco's boardsupporting the bid. But corporate America was watching the fightclosely to see how far the firm would go to protect its position asthe nation's premier leveraged buyout firm.   Since its founding in 1976, Kohlberg Kravis has not acquired acompany without the support of the target's board, although the firmgradually has become more aggressive in its deal making.   Kohlberg Kravis had announced Monday that it might begin the$90-a-share tender offer. That was just four days after Nabisco saidits top managers were considering trying to buy the company for $75a share, which would be worth $17 billion.   Nabisco stock edged up 12{ cents a share to $84.87{ in earlytrading today on the New York Stock Exchange.   The sheer size of Kohlberg Kravis's bid for Nabisco has forcedcorporations to reassess their own vulnerability.   ``There's been a gradual awakening over the past week that ifdeals above $10 billion are successful, it gives credibility to evenlarger deals, and it's getting down to almost a handful of companiesthat are secure'' based on sheer size alone, said one top takeoverlawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   According to one takeover specialist, who spoke on condition henot be identified, Kohlberg Kravis is ``attempting to keep biddingon bigger and bigger deals so other people in leveraged buyoutbusiness can't compete with them. They'd like to be thought of as... the only ones that come to mind when it's a super-big deal.''   The stakes are high with Nabisco. Not only are the potentialfinancial rewards astronomical, but there is the cachet that comeswith succeeding in a deal that carries a gargantuan price tag. Andon a more subtle level are the egos of those who are driven toestablish new benchmarks.   Supervising the firm's proposal is Henry Kravis, as prominent onthe New York social circuit as he is in the takeover game. He iswidely expected to go the distance to protect his company's lockupof mega-sized leveraged buyouts.   Kravis was particularly miffed that Nabisco was working withShearson, because he had been interested in the Atlanta-based foodand tobacco conglomerate for some time. Kravis first broached thesubject of leading a Nabisco buyout a year ago over dinner withNabisco's Johnson.   Nabisco's decision to stick with Shearson even after meeting withKravis pits him against his one-time skiing partner, ShearsonChairman Peter Cohen.   The sometimes abrasive Cohen has let slip in the press hisastonishment that Kravis would be such a tough competitor afterskiing and socializing with him. But those who know them wonder justhow close the pair was.   ``They are competitors in the same arena. They know one another,but I don't know if they are good friends. They're both very coolindividuals,'' a takeover specialist said.   Cohen is benefiting from Shearson's more subtle ties to Nabiscoin addition to having the support of the management team. Nabisco'sJohnson is said to be a close friend of James Robinson, chairman ofAmerican Express Co., Shearson's parent.   In an earlier era, Kohlberg Kravis worked on the same side of thefence as Shearson. Within the past year Kohlberg Kravis acquired JimWalter Corp. for $2.43 billion as Shearson served as the board'sbanker. And Shearson served in the same capacity when KohlbergKravis acquired Stop andamp; Shop Cos. for $1.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
