Prices at the producer level fell 0.3% in January, theirlargest decline in 10 months, the Labor Department said,indicating a sluggish economy continues to put a lid oninflation. Demonstrating more vividly the economy's weakness,the Federal Reserve said industrial production took itslargest drop since last February, tumbling 0.9% during themonth.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These figures show us that the first quarter is stillgoing to be a very weak quarter,&quot; said Carl Palash, senioreconomist for McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc., a New Yorkeconomic and financial consulting firm.   The decline in producer prices largely reflected energycosts, which have been pushed lower by mild weather and highinventories. Excluding food and energy, which vary widely inprice from month to month, the department's producer priceindex rose a moderate 0.3% and was up 2.5% from year-earlierlevels.   Analysts said this 0.3% increase in the so-called corerate of producer prices -- slightly higher than the 0.2% corerate in the prior three months -- overstates the underlyingwholesale inflation.   That's because auto sales showed a huge 1.5% jump inJanuary, mainly because of seasonal statistical adjustmentsthat analysts say should reverse in coming months. Excludingcar prices, the core rate of inflation rose 0.2%.Intermediate goods and crude goods showed no inflation at allon average. The consumer price index, which will be releasedtomorrow, is also expected to show little inflationarypressure.   Some people look toward low inflation as a signal to theFederal Reserve that it can cut interest rates further toboost the economy, but price declines by themselves probablyaren't enough to make the Fed act.   &quot;For financial markets, policy makers and the Fed {lowinflation} is a given,&quot; said Samuel Kahan, chief economistfor Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. &quot;They want to know whenthe recovery is coming, will it be sustained and how strongit will be.&quot;   So far, the answers still seem elusive. Though the recentspurt in retail sales gave hope that a healthy economy is onits way back, January's figures on industrial productionaren't as encouraging.   The drop in industrial output was broad-based, althoughmost of it came in the automotive sector, where productiondeclined roughly 8%.   &quot;Yes, a lot of decline is in autos, but just abouteverything else looks weak also,&quot; said Priscilla Trumbull,chief industrial economist for WEFA Group of suburbanPhiladelphia.   There were big drops in the output of consumer goods,transit equipment and business equipment. &quot;Manufacturerswould prefer to cannibalize their inventories than producenew goods,&quot; said Doug Handler, economist for Dun andamp; BradstreetCorp. in New York. In a related report, the Fed saidfactories were operating only at 78% of capacity in January,down from 78.8% in December and their lowest level sinceAugust 1983.   Separately, the Commerce Department said that in December,business inventories rose by 0.4%, the fourth consecutiveincrease. However, the weakness of business sales in December-- they fell 1.7% -- suggests that the inventory buildup wasinvoluntary.   All figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variations.   ---                      PRODUCER PRICES                                                                                                          Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes(1982=100) for January, before seasonal adjustment, and thepercentage changes from January, 1991.
