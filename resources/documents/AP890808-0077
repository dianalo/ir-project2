On Tuesday, a Tehran newspaperwas offering help again.   The events seem to be part of a tug of war between PresidentHashemi Rafsanjani and his followers _ called pragmatic by some andopportunist by others _ and the hard-liners of Interior MinisterAli Akbar Mohtashemi for control of Iran following the death inJune of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Rafsanjani made the offer of help in his inaugural speech lastweek. On Monday, Mohtashemi urged Shiite Moslems around the worldto continue fighting the United States, which Iran cals the ``greatSatan.''   On Tuesday, the English-language Tehran Times quoted a source itdid not identify as saying Iran would ``definitely'' intercede togain the release of the hostages if Washington gave assurances itwould release frozen Iranian assets.   Rafsanjani, allied with spiritual leader Ali Khamenei, is knownto seek better ties with the West in the effort to rebuild Iranafter eight years of war with Iraq. He appears to see freeing thehostages as a first step to good relations.   Mohtashemi's faction, including Premier Hussein Musavi and AhmadKhomeini, son of the revolutionary patriarch, wants the revolutionto keep its confrontational edge.   For hard-liners, diplomatic reliations mean compromise with theenemy. Many radical Shiite Moslems in Lebanon agree with them.   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, most by Shiitegroups sponsored by Iran. Eight are Americans.   About $2 billion in assets, including military equipment orderedbefore the revolution, were frozen after the U.S. Embassy in Tehranwas stormed in February 1979 by militant students, who held 52Americans hostage for 444 days. Iran claims the assets now areworth $12 billion.   According to the source quoted in the Tehran Times, U.S.assurances that the assets will be released ``should be concreteand there should be convincing grounds that these proposals will betranslated into action.'' Excerpts of the report were carried bythe official Islamic Republic News Agency.   Repeating Iran's frequently stated position, the source said:``It's a well-known fact that we do not have any direct or indirecthand in hostage-taking. Of course, we have spiritual influence inLebanon which we can use in our efforts for the release of thehostages there.''   Mohammad Javad Larijani, former deputy foreign minister and aRafsanjani ally, was quoted in a dispatch from the news agency assaying ``it would be a great achievement for the world of Islam''if Iran could secure the release of the hostages.   ``It will make it clear that Iran has always been working forthe benefit of humanity,'' IRNA quoted him as saying.   Larijani had helped improve diplomatic relations with the West,but resigned earlier this year when a struggle over the issue beganin the leadership.   In an editorial Tuesday, the Tehran Times called the UnitedStates ``an oppresser'' for freezing the assets and said relationsbetween the two countries would be like that of ``lamb and wolf.''   It added, however: ``As the officials of the Islamic Republichave said repeatedly, the doors are not completely closed and theright intentions and thoughts can help resolve the problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
