(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A substantial number of workers at aGeneral Electric Co. defense plant here will be laid off because ofa drop in orders from the Pentagon, the company announced Thursday.   Arthur Glenn, vice president of GE's Defense Systems Division,refused to say exactly how many workers would be laid off or when.   However, GE officials informed the state it would lay off about900 workers over the next 18 months because of a decrease indefense-related orders, according to a state economic affairsofficial.   The first phase of the layoffs is scheduled for July, accordingto the official, who asked not to be identified.   The unexpected announcement by the company came only threemonths after GE promised stable employment at its Pittsfieldbusinesses this year. The company had laid off 1,000 workers lastyear when it closed its transformer plant.   The ordnance division, which employs 4,700 people, makesguidance systems for Trident submarine-launched nuclear missiles,components of the Bradley fighting machine, which carriesinfantrymen, various high-speed guns and other military products.   ``The market we serve we thought, up to a year ago, to be atleast in a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis,'' Glennsaid at a news conference.   He blamed the sudden turnaround on government cutbacks inordnance contracts.   ``As pressure gets tough on defense budgets, governmentcustomers have to make difficult decisions,'' Glenn said.   He said a government contract the company recently lost toNorthrup Industries had little to do with the layoffs.   ``We had really planned our business based on not winning thatcontract because there was so much controvery over whether the AirForce wished to use our technology,'' Glenn said. ``Certainly ifthat contract had come, I would not have had to take as severe anaction as we're going to have to take without it.''   Glenn also said a decrease in orders would mean a slowdown inBradley fighting machine production, from 550 yearly to about 350.   He said he told the company's 500 management employees Thursdaymorning about the impending layoffs. Neither managers nor unionofficials could be immediately reached for comment.   GE now employs about 6,700 people in the ordnance and plasticsplants in the city, the number it had employeed in 1983, before thecompany began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1,400new employees by late 1986.   Workers at the company were dealt a major blow in the fall of1986 when GE announced it would close its transformer division inPittsfield.   GE announced in August 1987 it was reorganizing the ordnancedivision to eliminate the engineering and manufacturing departmentand replace it with a Division Effectiveness Operation to improveefficiency.   ``The steps we are taking are usually taken by businesses introuble and we are not in trouble,'' division Vice PresidentNicholas Boraski said at the time.</TEXT></DOC>
