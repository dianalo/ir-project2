(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A nurse convicted of killing fourpatients by injecting them with a paralyzing drug so he couldrevive them and appear a hero was sentenced Wednesday to 50 yearsto life in prison.   ``You had no right to usurp God's function,'' Judge Alfred Tischtold Richard Angelo in imposing the maximum sentence allowed bystate law.   Tisch said Angelo, who was emotionless as sentencing waspronounced, had violated ``in the cruelest, most inhumane manner''the childlike trust a hospital patient places in a nurse.   The patients, most of them sick and elderly, ``had a right toenjoy, in their own way, every day that was available to them,'' hesaid.   Angelo, 27, of Lindenhurst, was convicted Dec. 15 of two countsof murder, one of manslaughter and one of criminally negligenthomicide in the 1987 deaths at Good Samaritan Hospital.   Angelo told authorities he injected the patients with Pavulon, aparalyzing drug, so that when they stopped breathing and he was thefirst on the scene, he could revive them and be a hero.   Prosecutor John Collins said Angelo administered the fatalinjections out of inadequacy and because of his deep-rootedcontempt for authority.   Collins asked the court to treat Angelo with the same compassionthat he showed his victims, and urged the maximum sentence.   ``These were no folks who took an ill-advised stroll in CentralPark after dark,'' he said. ``These were sick, vulnerable peoplewho had entrusted their care to this defendant.''   Angelo's attorney, Eric Naiburg, said he would file a notice ofappeal. He said he had expected the maximum sentence.   Angelo was handcuffed and led to the county jail, where he hasbeen held since his arrest in November 1987, a month after thekillings.   He also was convicted of assault in connection with the deathsof four patients and the near-death of another. He was acquitted ofassaulting two patients.   Collins said authorities suspect Angelo was responsible for thedeaths of several other patients, as he also used the druganectine, whose detection in skin tissue disappears 24 hours afteruse.   Outside the courthouse, family members of some of the victimssaid they wished that Angelo could have received the death penalty.   That was the opinion of Kieran Greene, whose 57-year-old fatherAnthony died from a Pavulon injection. ``We have to put this behindus and move forward, but we'll never forget,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
