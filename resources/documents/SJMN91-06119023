Page 12A  </MEMO><TEXT>     There's so much going on, in fact, you can almost forget there's a game onthe field.;    &quot;I don't need all this stuff. It's like an amusement park,&quot;lamented Mary Ellen Fitzsimmons of Pleasanton. &quot;It's catering to the yuppiegeneration.&quot;;    Glenn Lustig agrees, saying today's baseball crowd is lessknowledgeable, less tuned in and less excited.;    &quot;People say to me, 'Why goto the game? They're nearly all on TV.' I tell them there's something aboutbeing in the ballpark,&quot; said the Richmond man, who shares a season ticket.&quot;Now there's not such a tremendous difference. It is like watching it on TV.&quot;;   In this age of marketing, the ol' ballpark will never be the same. Thecurrent wave -- as disconcerting to some traditionalists as &quot;the wave&quot;rippling across the bleachers -- is to turn the stadium into a baseball themepark that offers a hassle-free time for mom and dad and enough entertainmentto tame even the antsiest toddler.;    Whether it's sushi in Anaheim, animatedskateboard races on the scoreboard in San Diego or a gin and tonic served at a400-seat center-field bar in Toronto, fans can probably find something toenjoy even if their team takes a June swoon.;    &quot;Teams can't just throw openthe doors and say, 'Baseball today!' and expect to have 2 1/2 million peoplecome in every year,&quot; said Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing Report ofChicago, the newsletter that calculated it will cost a family of four anaverage of $76.22 to attend a major league baseball game this season.;    Itwasn't so long ago that baseball teams were ecstatic to draw 1 million fans.Today, that's a mark of failure. Teams no longer can rely on season-ticketsales and die-hard baseball fans. For one thing, fans are fickle, and no teamcan guarantee a winner -- not even the mighty Oakland A's, with threeconsecutive World Series appearances, or the San Francisco Giants, with theirmultimillion-dollar free agents.;    Can't bank on winning team;  &quot;If peopleonly come out because of the phenomenon of winning, that's a prescription fordisaster,&quot; said Pat Gallagher, senior vice president of business operations.;   The Giants' strategy once was to poke fun at the arctic conditions atCandlestick Park, but no more. Instead, the Giants, A's and other teams areworking hard to sell a pleasurable ballpark experience in hopes of luring thefan who comes to the ballpark only once or twice a year. And no matter howexciting it is to see Rickey Henderson set base-stealing records, occasionalfans expect more than just a ballgame.;    That means dot racing, baseballbloopers and rock music between innings. That means a wider variety of food toeat and brand names that are trusted. That means spotless restrooms and snappyservice.;    &quot;Our job is to keep them constantly entertained,&quot; said RobGallas, senior vice president of marketing and broadcasting for the ChicagoWhite Sox. &quot;Don't let them get bored for one moment -- whether they are 80 or8.&quot;;    Perhaps no one is better at that job than the Oakland A's. Though AndyDolich, the A's vice president of business operations, acknowledges &quot;there areabsolutely no secrets in the business, and no Shangri-La to go to find out howto do it,&quot; the team nonetheless has earned respect within baseball as a sultanof swat when it comes to making the ballpark a nifty place to visit. And thefans apparently agree. Last year, 2.9 million fans made the A's the top drawin Northern California among all forms of entertainment with turnstiles,Dolich said.;    'Ultimate tailgate party';  The A's aren't holding pat thisyear, either. Friday night, the team opened a food court featuring eats fromRound Table Pizza, Subway Sandwiches and an Oakland restaurant called JadeVilla, making the Coliseum one of the few ballparks to feature brand-namefoods. When added to the stadium's menu of hot dogs, fajitas and the like,&quot;It's the ultimate long-term tailgate party,&quot; Dolich said.;    The A's alsohave banned smoking in the stands to make the stadium more comfortable forfamilies and added a Great Western Bank automated teller machine forcash-strapped fans. And this is the first full year of operation for theFoster Farms Family Place, a romper area for restless kids to play and snackin while parents stay tuned to the ballgame via TV.;    The A's also aremoving to improve service for season-ticket buyers, whose ranks have swollento 16,000, up from 326 when the Haas family bought the team from the mercurialCharlie Finley in 1980. Dolich said the team has added about 10 people to itscustomer-service effort -- up from two last year -- installed a computer tohelp sort out problems and empowered staffers to decide quickly how to copewith complaints.;    Bright lights, non-skid floors;  Not all innovations atmajor league ballparks are as obvious as the aroma of pepperoni at the foodcourt, however. The San Diego Padres, for instance, performed some&quot;housekeeping&quot; that included the installation of non-skid floors, brighterlights and a no-seam backstop screen suspended by cables instead of poles toimprove the view of the field.;    Teams make most of their money frombroadcast rights, fees for luxury boxes and ticket sales. But teams andconcessionaires say food sales are still key ingredients in terms of customersatisfaction and profits.;    The California Angels began expanding their menuin the early 1980s, and fans now fork over about $8 a head on everything fromsushi to sloppy Joes to cinnamon buns. &quot;It is a bottomless pit ofdiscretionary money,&quot; said John Hays, the Angels' senior vice president ofmarketing. &quot;People do not seem to come to the ballpark with a specific budgetin mind. They seem to come to the stadium with desire.&quot;;    Increasingly, theA's and a handful of other teams have opened their gates to brand-name foods.Besides providing fans a trusted, uniform meal that executives commonly referto as &quot;food product,&quot; chain foods offer teams fees, a cut of food sales andcross-promotion opportunities.;    Deep Dhindsa, president of SubwayDevelopment Co., said his company agreed to pay &quot;a five-figure&quot; onetime feefor the Coliseum franchise, plus a share of sales as part of the five-yeardeal. In return, he aims to sell $4.25 sandwiches to 5 to 10 percent of thecrowd and to get the Subway name splashed around the Bay Area.;    Risingattendance in major league baseball indicates teams are on the right track ingussying up and promoting their ballparks. Still, some traditionalists willcomplain baseball is being bastardized, that the mass-market audience is lessknowledgeable about the game, that the hot dog will be supplanted by sushi,that the sport's focus is shifting inexorably from the diamond toDiamondvision.;    Dolich challenges that complaint, however.;    &quot;Does a foodcourt hurt a baseball purist? Absolutely not. Does dot racing detract from thegame? I don't think so,&quot; he said. &quot;It still has no effect when Nolan Ryansteps to the mound and says, 'Hey, Jose, hit this.' &quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK SCHWANHAUSSER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910428  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,310  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 28, 199100119023,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
