Energy analysts said buyers flocked to oil futures in the earlygoing, building on the momentum begun in Wednesday's session. Therecent steep price slide encouraged buyers looking for bargains. Butthe technical rally ran out steam in later trading once sellersresumed unloading contracts.   The contract July delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $16.67 a 42-gallonbarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, losing 25 cents. Thatmore than wiped out Wednesday's 24-cent gain. Later months alsoposted declines.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for July delivery, which moved 0.54cent higher on Wednesday, fell 0.75 cent a gallon to 57.61 cents.Contracts for later delivery ended lower also.   The July contract for home heating oil dropped 0.41 cent to 46.90cents a gallon after gaining 0.20 cent Wednesday. Subsequent monthsalso skidded.   James R. Fiedler, an energy broker at E.D.andamp;F. Man InternationalFutures Inc., said the technical buying lacked any fundamentalsupport so the rally fizzled. He said an abundance of crude oilcontinues to weigh on the market.   In natural gas trading, the July contract increased to $1.573 per1,000 cubic feet from $1.560 on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
