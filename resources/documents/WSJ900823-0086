The proposal, a step toward global 24-hour trading, mustbe cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, becauseit involves predawn trading in the U.S. The hitch arisesbecause the SEC is pressing the new Nasdaq system to publishU.S.-style market data, principally trade-by-trade price andvolume figures.</LP><TEXT>   Less stringent publication requirements have been proposedby Nasdaq, which is striving to woo business in U.S. stocksaway from London's International Stock Exchange.   The NASD fears that dealers in the relatively thin Londonmarket, accustomed to reporting skimpier information, willbalk at using a program with American-style rules, Joseph R.Hardiman, NASD president, said in a telephone interview fromWashington, D.C. The NASD is the self-regulator for the U.S.over-the-counter market.   The disagreement highlights a larger issue, as world stockmarkets become increasingly entwined and U.S. markets expandoverseas: Can a system meeting tough U.S. regulations competewith more lenient foreign systems? Or must a system be bentto meet local custom?   &quot;Our job is to further the integrity of the marketplaceand protect investors,&quot; Kathryn Natale, the SEC's assistantdirector for OTC matters, said in a phone interview fromWashington. &quot;We've discussed our concerns with the NASD,including real-time information -- or rather, the lackthereof.&quot;   Ms. Natale said it is &quot;clearly within the realm ofpossibility&quot; that the SEC would allow the program to publishless market data. But she added: &quot;We don't know if that's thebest thing for markets today. We don't know if it's advisableto take a step backward.&quot;   Mr. Hardiman seemed to be setting the stage for acompromise on the Nasdaq plan for a two-year pilot program,saying the NASD might propose shortening the pilot period inreturn for less strict disclosure requirements.   As previously reported, the program would involve predawntrading of more than 300 Nasdaq issues, mainly stocks of U.S.companies, including about 70 that are listed on the Londonstock exchange. The trading would start at 3:30 a.m. Easterntime in the U.S., which is five time zones behind London.   Traders said the NASD plan could be threatened from bothsides of the Atlantic. They doubt that London traders andcustomers would use the program if it required U.S.-typedisclosure. And they said that without such disclosure, itmight be illegal for certain U.S. fiduciaries to participate-- mainly pension funds, which operate under the federalEmployee Retirement Income Security Act.   Mr. Hardiman is hopeful that the SEC will see things theNASD's way. &quot;Commission members recognize the need for U.S.markets to be competitive world-wide,&quot; he said. But he addedthat because of the discussions with the SEC, &quot;We may not getstarted in September.&quot; And he indicated the program might bedropped if the SEC rules against Nasdaq and dealers boycottthe system, saying rhetorically, &quot;We can bring up the bestsystem in the world, but if no one commits their capital. . ..&quot;   Under the NASD plan, Nasdaq would collect from dealers allprice and volume data on each trade, storing it forsurveillance purposes. But rather than report individualtrade data on Nasdaq's ticker in the U.S., the NASD wouldissue periodic quotes and volume information, said J. LyntonJones, the NASD's London-based executive director for Europe.   Mr. Hardiman explained: &quot;It's not like in the U.S., whereyou have 50 dealers trading Apple Computer. In the U.K., youhave maybe two or three in most stocks, and people canquickly sense what the position of a competitor is.&quot;   Actually, the Nasdaq plan would offer London dealersslower disclosure than that provided by the London exchangefor British stocks. The London exchange's ticker reportsBritish trades with a three-minute delay, except for largetrades, which are reported after 90 minutes. But there isn'tany organized market data system now for U.S. stocks tradedon the London exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
