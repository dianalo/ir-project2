In administrative proceedings yesterday, the SEC alleged that the Houston-based bank-holding company overstated its 1984 earnings by 8% because of the inadequate reserves. The agency also said the company underreported its earnings by an amount that wasn't specified for the 1985 first quarter.    Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, Texas Commerce Bancshares settled the matter by promising to follow revised procedures for determining loan-loss reserves at its flagship bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston, and at 67 subsidiary banks. The procedures were revamped under agreement with the Comptroller of the Currency.    Texas Commerce Bancshares was one of the nation's 25 largest bank-holding companies until it was acquired last May by Chemical Texas Holdings Inc., a Chemical New York Corp. unit.    Texas Commerce disclosed in March that it had agreed to settle a proposed administrative proceeding pertaining to its reserve for possible loan losses.    A spokesman for the bank holding company added that shareholders had been notified of the conflict more than two years ago. The settlement, he said, doesn't involve any penalty or requirement to restate reported earnings for any period.    A spokesman for Chemical New York said Chemical had no comment on the SEC proceedings.    The SEC alleged that Texas Commerce Bancshares, and its Houston bank in particular, lacked an adequate loan-review system for identifying problem loans from at least 1981 through 1984. The deficiencies in the system were magnified by the sharp growth in the holding company's aggregate loan portfolio and by the severe economic downturn in Texas and other oil-producing states, the agency said in its administrative order.    The SEC faulted the holding company's management for failing to add sufficient staff to review its growing portfolio and for relying on loan officers, rather than employees independent of lending operations, to pinpoint problem loans.    At the end of 1984, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston had a loan-loss reserve of $74 million, or about 1% of its total loans and leases, according to the SEC. But examiners from the Comptroller of the Currency's office determined that the Houston bank should have set aside reserves of $101.7 million. They also concluded that three other banks in the Texas Commerce Bancshares system had loan-loss reserves insufficient by a total of $500,000, the SEC said.    The SEC alleged that the holding company violated the corporate reporting, record-keeping and accounting provisions of the securities laws. Under the settlement, Texas Commerce Bancshares neither admitted nor denied that it had violated those provisions, but agreed to comply with them in the future.    In addition, the company agreed to file a report with the SEC detailing financial effects of its deficient loan-loss reserves. </TEXT></DOC>
