But he saidhe was confident that black voters would judge him morefavorably than have black leaders because &quot;I know what's inmy heart, I know what our record is.&quot;   Mr. Bush expressed his concerns in a news conference wherehe formally lifted economic sanctions against South Africa.</LP><TEXT>   The removal of the penalties, which was expected, cameover the objections of many black and Democratic lawmakers inthe U.S. as well as many black South African leaders. Criticshad argued that the white-minority ruled government hasn'tfully dismantled apartheid or implemented political rightsfor all races.   Yesterday, the National Association for the Advancement ofColored People, meeting in Houston, passed a resolutionurging Congress to reimpose economic sanctions, saying thatthe South African government hasn't fully met the conditionsof the law.   The African National Congress, the primary organization inopposition to apartheid rule, called Mr. Bush's action&quot;premature.&quot; Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC's secretary general,said there was no climate for free political activity, as thelaw demands, because violence prevents it. Moreover, he said&quot;large numbers of persons, defined as political prisoners interms of agreement reached between the ANC and the SouthAfrican government, remain in jail.&quot;   But South African President F.W. de Klerk issued astatement saying, &quot;The removal of these sanctions willcontribute to the revival of our economy to the benefit ofall South Africans,&quot; especially the unemployed.   Mr. Bush praised the South African president for freeinganti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison, forlegalizing banned political parties, and for leading theeffort to repeal apartheid laws.   The president said he terminated the sanctions because the1986 law imposing them left him little discretion. But headded, &quot;I happen to think it's the right thing to do. Ibelieve that this will result in more progress toward racialequity instead of less, and certainly in more economicopportunity rather than less.&quot; He also noted that a ban onarms sales and restrictions on Export-Import Bank loans wouldremain in place.   Separately, President Bush said he would be amenable to acompromise on the issue of federal regulations that bardoctors at federally funded clinics from counseling aboutabortion. Although he said he wouldn't alter his &quot;fundamentalposition&quot; on abortion, he said, &quot;If there's something thatcan be worked out, can be resolved, so much the better.&quot;   At the news conference, the president also responded to aspeech by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), who said Mr. Bushused his 1988 campaign &quot;to divide white and black voters andappeal to fear&quot; with advertisements featuring a black rapistnamed Willie Horton who had assaulted a white woman whilefree from prison on a furlough. Mr. Bradley said Mr. Bush ismaking a similar effort to exploit racial tension in hisdiscussions of civil rights legislation.   The tone of Sen. Bradley's speech was surprisinglypersonal. At one point, he quoted a 1964 speech by Mr. Bushstating opposition to the landmark 1964 civil rights bill.Sen. Bradley said President Bush had &quot;never repudiated orexplained&quot; this stand.   Although Sen. Bradley has not been involved in bipartisantalks on the job-bias bill between Sen. John Danforth (R.,Mo.) and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), an aide said thatSen. Bradley alerted Majority Leader George Mitchell and Sen.Kennedy about his planned speech.   Mr. Bush objected to Sen. Bradley's charges, saying, &quot;Idon't like that. I don't agree with it, totally. I didn't useany Willie Horton ad of that nature, either.&quot; He said thatthe advertisements were meant to attack the unfairness of aprison furlough program.   In addition to his moves on South Africa, Mr. Bush hasalso jousted with civil rights leaders over competing civilrights proposals aimed at buttressing job-discriminationclaims. Mr. Bush vetoed a civil rights measure last year andhas resisted a new version drafted by Congress this year,saying it would lead to hiring quotas.   Mr. Bush's nomination last month of Clarence Thomas, aconservative black federal judge, to succeed Supreme CourtJustice Thurgood Marshall, the court's sole black appointeeand a venerated civil rights leader, has also stirred muchdebate among black and civil rights leaders about Mr. Bush'scommitment to continuing civil rights gains.   Although he defended each decision separately, thepresident conceded that if he himself were black, he &quot;wouldbe concerned&quot; if he believed all the accusations leveledagainst him.   Mr. Bush, unlike his predecessor Ronald Reagan, hasrepeatedly invited leaders of major black organizations tothe White House. Still, he suggested for the first time thatcomplaints from black leaders don't necessarily reflect theviews of most black Americans. &quot;I know what I feel, and Iknow what I think is right,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;ifthere's a pounding away from leaders that claim to speak forall the black community, yes, it worries me.&quot;   The president suggested that much of the criticism leveledagainst him, as well as his Supreme Court nominee, ismotivated by ideological opposition. And he said he woulddefend his record directly to black Americans, if necessary.   &quot;I am going to take my case . . . to black Americans andsay, `Hey, listen, we've got a good record on civil rightsand we're going to continue it. And you ought to be rejoicingthat we have a very able judge to be elevated to the SupremeCourt and similarly on civil rights,' &quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
