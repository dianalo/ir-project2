The awards are given annually by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation in New York to leaders in clinical and basic medical research. The awards carry a $15,000 honorarium.    Vincent T. Dole, professor and senior physician at The Rockefeller University in New York, won this year's prize in clinical medicine for work begun in the 1960s that illuminated the physical basis of heroin addiction. He also was honored for developing a maintenance treatment program using the synthetic opiate drug methadone.    &quot;Methadone allowed physicians for the first time to approach addiction as a medical problem&quot; and not just a criminal or psychological deviancy, Dr. Dole said.    Sharing this year's prize in basic medical research are two scientists who in the early 1970s and early 1980s explored the intricate workings of RNA, which is copied from deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, to make proteins in the body.    Thomas R. Cech, professor of chemistry, biochemistry and biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, won for discovering that RNA can act as its own enzyme or catalyst as it cuts and resplices itself into the genetic message units that produce proteins. Previously it had been widely believed that all enzymes must be proteins.    The other scientist, molecular biologist Phillip A. Sharp, discovered that after a gene is copied from DNA to RNA, it can &quot;edit&quot; itself, excising meaningless portions, which he called introns, and resplicing together the substantive part of the genetic code into working messages. Mr. Sharp is director of the Cancer Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.    &quot;The big impact of our work has been that we now know how to look at the way genes are regulated,&quot; Mr. Sharp said. &quot;Changes in gene regulation are important in carcinogenesis and in embryonic development, growth, healing and aging -- and all these regulatory changes involve RNA splicing in one way or another.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
