But with chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste tohousing, the cheers are now drowned out by calls to spend availablerubles on Earth.   The Soviet space program has become the latest target ofcriticism as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of``glasnost,'' or openness, unleashes long-suppressed publiccomplaints.   Untold billions of rubles were spent to put the first Sputniksatellite in orbit 1957, to make Yuri Gagarin the first man inspace in 1961, and to achieve other space feats.   On April 12, the anniversary of Gagarin's flight in Vostok-1, anewspaper recalled how Soviets celebrated the news by singing anddancing through the streets.   But more than 31 years after Sputnik circled the globe, Sovietspace exploration has not realized the prediction of Russian rocketpioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who said harnessing the cosmoswould bring ``mountains of bread and enormous power'' to those whomastered it.   Soviets began soul-searching about space expenses after a seriesof problems with their country's space program. The problemscoincided with official pressure to cut a $162 billion budgetdeficit and growing impatience with shortages of food, consumergoods and housing.   In part for economy reasons, the Mir space lab will be without acrew for three months starting Thursday when three cosmonautsreturn to Earth.   The debate on Soviet space spending is reminiscent of theAmerican public's questioning of the billions of dollars spent onthe Apollo project in the 1960s and 1970s to put men on the moonwhile some Americans lived in poverty.   Controversy over space spending spilled into the open early thisyear in the campaign for a new parliament. Candidates, includingmaverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, received some popular supportwhen they suggested the space program be put on hold for a fewyears.   The Kremlin already has reduced outlays for another institutiononce outside public criticism, the military. Last year, Sovietleaders announced some defense plants will be converted to produceconsumer goods, food and building supplies to parry chronicshortages.   Adding fuel to the space-spending controversy were the Novemberlaunch of the $10 billion shuttle Buran; the loss in September andMarch of two unmanned Mars probes, Phobos I and II, at a cost of ahalf-billion dollars; and embarrasing delays caused by technicalproblems and human error in the landings of the last two crews fromMir last year.   Opposition grew when space officials hungry for foreign currencylast month chose a Japanese _ and not a Soviet who could only payrubles _ for the first commercial trip to Mir. The price tag was$11 million.   The public has flooded the press with letters, and articles haveexamined the costs and benefits of the space program.   ``Isn't it too lavish to finance space? Perhaps it pays to stopuntil we fill the holes (shortages),'' 10 readers suggested in ajoint letter to the Defense Ministry daily, Red Star.   Defenders of space exploration emphasize the benefits oftechnology and information transfers to the Earth-bound economy.The Tass news agency recently reported that more than $2 billionwas spent on space research in the Soviet Union last year and thateconomic benefits totaled $3.2 billion.   Satellites have gathered weather information, extendedtelevision and telephone service, aided navigation of ships andlocated mineral and oil deposits, according to articles instate-run media.   But media reports have said industry is not adequately using theinformation and technology, and they have criticized thespendthrift attitude of government agencies involved in space.   Pravda and other newspapers say public support has declinedbecause space officials tout successes and hide problems.   ``Such propaganda not only did not inspire trust, but converselyalienated people from this sphere and took away their feeling ofparticipation,'' wrote the space correspondent of the labor dailyTrud, Vitaly Golovachev.   Space scientist Roald Sagdeyev said officials must work hard tosave the space program and also acknowledge failures.   ``We have one very serious task: to restore the people's faith,though glasnost, through truthful information that is honest to theend,'' he told colleagues at a recent meeting about the Phobosproblems. ``We must show and prove to the people that withoutspace, mankind doesn't have a future.''   Some Soviet officials admit they have made mistakes,particularly in not doing more to put space research to practicaluse. They envy the United States for sucesses in that area.   ``Our space technology is one of the most advanced. Naturally ifwe do it right like the Americans and convert it to other fields,we can receive a big economic effect,'' said Viktor D. Blagov,Mir's deputy flight director.   Blagov, in a telephone interview, cited NASA figures that forevery dollar invested in the U.S. space program, $9 is returned intechnology benefits. According to the Tass figures, the Sovietreturn is about 1.5 rubles for every ruble spent.   In an attempt to make space research yield a better financialreturn, NASA's Soviet counterpart, Glavkosmos, is hoping to sellcrystals grown in Mir's zero-gravity for use in electronics, aswell as medicines manufactured on the space station.   The Soviets also are starting to charge foreign crews that wantto travel to Mir, at $10-12 million a shot.</TEXT></DOC>
