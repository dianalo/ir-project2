Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP GE </CO><IN> AIR ARO </IN><TEXT>   Last Sunday's crash of an Airbus A-320 in France highlights a fact of life for pilots that few passengers know about: Unlike a car or even a small plane, a jet engine takes several seconds to react to a pilot's commands.    This delay is largely due to something called &quot;spool-up&quot; -- the time it takes for the many parts of a jet engine to start moving and accelerate to the desired level. This lag can be as long as eight seconds on modern engines.    It may be months before investigators report on what caused the crash of the Airbus A-320, a highly computerized twin-engine jet that seats 150 people. Three passengers were killed when the aircraft hit a clump of trees and crashed after failing to pull out of a low fly-by at an air show. According to a rescuer, the pilot said the plane didn't respond to his commands to boost power; some French officials suggested he was simply flying too low.    In either case, the pilot's ability to react would have been hampered by the jet's spool-up time. The incident shows how important anticipation is for jet pilots. It also shows how spool-up can be an important factor in a plane's performance at critical times -- particularly when the plane is near the ground, where there's less space or time to maneuver than in midair. For instance, spool-up time can hamper a pilot's ability to fly through wind shear or abort a landing.    &quot;Every pilot is conscious&quot; of the spool-up lag, says Jim Halverson, a captain at Northwest Airlines and a spokesman for its pilots' union.    John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute in Worthington, Ohio, says the advent of jet engines in the 1950s and 1960s led to some commercial crashes as pilots used to quicker-responding propeller aircraft moved into jet cockpits.    All this may come as a surprise to passengers who think increasing power in a jet is like stepping on the accelerator of a car. Although there's a delay as either type of engine responds, a powerful jet engine takes seconds longer. Aviation experts say the lag for modern engines on commercial jet aircraft ranges from two to eight seconds, depending mainly on engine speed and also, to a lesser extent, on the type of engine.    &quot;You automatically think of speed when you think of jets,&quot; says David Venz, a U.S. spokesman for Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that built the A-320. &quot;Those concepts just go together. But a jet engine just doesn't operate like a six-cylinder engine in your Chevy.&quot;    Industry officials and pilots say that unless there's a malfunction, commands from a pilot to increase power should reach an engine almost instantaneously. The delay comes as the engine takes time to respond. Passengers might notice this lag as the plane prepares for takeoff, when the roar of the engines comes before the plane starts to move.    Jay Pardee, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's engine certification office in Burlington, Mass., says the delay has to do with the tremendous size and power of a jet engine: It simply takes time for the heavy disks and large fans in the engine to accelerate.    The spool-up lag means pilots have to be prepared to react quickly to potentially dangerous situations, such as wind shear. Wind shear, a rapid change in the speed or direction of the air, can cause the aircraft to lose speed or altitude abruptly. Pilots trying to compensate for that with more power can face delays as the engines spool up.    Such delays also can be crucial when a pilot decides for one reason or another to abort a landing. Al Palmer, chief pilot at the University of North Dakota's Center for Aerospace Sciences in Grand Forks, N.D., says a pilot of a small jet who decides to attempt such a &quot;go-around&quot; at an altitude of 100 feet or less risks hitting the ground because the engine doesn't respond fast enough.    The lower the engine speed, the longer it takes to regain full power. In the Airbus case, pilots and safety officials say the plane's speed and the speed of its engines before the crash are likely to be examined closely by French authorities.    Mr. Galipault of the Aviation Safety Institute says pilots are taught to approach landings at correct glide rates and sufficient speeds. &quot;You keep the energy of the airplane high enough to keep the airplane under control,&quot; he says. With the engine at 80% to 90% power, for example, spool-up time to full power is reduced to a few seconds.    Although the French pilots' union appears to disagree, Airbus's Mr. Venz says, &quot;Everything we know about this accident leads us to believe the airplane was performing properly.&quot; He says the three European carriers that grounded the remaining five A-320s after the crash have put them back in the air.    The A-320 hasn't been certified in the U.S., but the CFM56-5 engine used on the plane has. A spokesman for CFM International says the engine betters the Federal Aviation Administration's guidelines for commercial jets. One test requires engines to take no more than five seconds to go from 15% thrust, or power, to 95%.    Another test, which comes with the engine on the plane, essentially calls for a maximum of eight seconds to go from idle speed to sufficient thrust for the plane to begin climbing. CFM says its engine also betters this standard. Airbus says it expects the FAA to certify the plane by year's end.    CFM, a joint venture of General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Snecma of France, has supplied the engines on the A-320s already delivered and is to supply engines on 100 A-320s ordered by Northwest Airlines.    Industry officials and pilots say they have yet to see any indication that the power lag on the A-320 is any longer than on existing aircraft. &quot;I have no hesitation about flying the airplane,&quot; says Harold Gay, a pilot at Pan American World Airways, which is to receive the first of its 16 A-320s next summer. </TEXT></DOC>
