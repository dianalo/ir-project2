One study investigated the problem of how to constructfederal incentives to induce greater use of competitive contracting intransit operations. Prior research has revealed that cost savings inthe range of 20 to 40% are possible from contracting in larger metropolitanareas, but very few transit systems have chosen to begin contractingservice. This study examined various federal policy options and useda combination of theoretical analysis and interviews with transit executivesand others to identify changes in subsidy and capital grant programsthat will induce greater use of contracting. The second study examinedthe effect of allowing private operators to freely enter the transitmarket, a policy which is essentially untried in the U.S. Using Philadelphiaas an example, results indicate that where subsidized public operationscontinued, private operations would focus on markets that were not wellserved by the public operator and markets where traffic is dense.</TEXT></DOC>
