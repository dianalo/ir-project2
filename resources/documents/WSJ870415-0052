Early in the day, actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds plunged in frenzied trading after the Commerce Department reported an unexpected surge in the nation's merchandise trade deficit for February. Also weighing heavily on the bond markets was another sharp increase in the price of gold, which is watched closely as an indicator of inflation.    Nevertheless, Treasury bond prices later rebounded to finish the day with only small declines. After being down nearly two points early yesterday morning, 30-year Treasury issues wound up with declines of about 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought the total drop since March 26 to about nine points.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due in 2016 yielded more than 8 1/2% at one stage early yesterday, the highest level in more than a year. Late in the day, the issue yielded about 8 3/8%, a sharp increase from 7.55% nearly three weeks ago.    Some short-term interest rates rose sharply, intensifying speculation that banks will raise their prime lending rate again soon. Only about two weeks ago, banks raised their prime rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%, the first nationwide increase in nearly three years. Many economists now expect an increase this week to 8%, or possibly even 8 1/4%, because of recent sharp increases in banks' own borrowing costs.    &quot;I would be real surprised if we don't have a prime-rate increase to at least 8% before the end of this week,&quot; said Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. He said he is surprised some banks haven't already done so. &quot;But it's possible the banks got such bad public reactions the last time they raised the prime they may want to drag their feet on raising it again,&quot; he said.    After the most recent prime-rate increase, skeptics retorted that the banks were attempting to fatten their profit margins in anticipation of large losses on their loans to Latin America, especially Brazil. Citibank, which initiated the move March 31, insisted that it was acting merely because of increases in its own borrowing costs over the past few months.    &quot;There is a distinct possibility of another increase in the prime rate,&quot; said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Wharton Economics Inc. &quot;But Germany and Japan could act to cut their interest rates in the next week or two, lessening the upward pressure here.&quot;    Banks use the prime rate as a base for setting rates on loans to many small and medium-sized businesses, as well as on many types of consumer loans. The recent increase to 7 3/4% represented the first nationwide increase since June 1984.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, prices of most municipal bonds plummeted, extending their extremely deep slump. Actively traded issues fell one to three points, but bids for some less actively traded bonds were off by as much as six points. According to traders and analysts, a recent wave of selling by tax-exempt bond funds finally prompted institutional investors to unload positions and jittery traders to follow suit.    &quot;It was another brutal day in the war zone,&quot; said Lawrence Morris, senior vice president of municipal bonds at Butcher andamp; Singer Inc. of Philadelphia. &quot;There's been a massive influx of sellers in the last week, and the market is as oversold as I've ever seen it.&quot;    Traditionally, tax-exempt bond funds experience higher-than-usual redemptions prior to the April 15 tax-filing deadline as investors get cash to pay their taxes. &quot;But the degree to which we've seen cash flowing out of the funds this year is atypical&quot; says Neal Atterman, head of municipal bond research for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    Investors in T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.'s group of mutual funds have exchanged more than $50 million out of tax-exempt bond funds since April 1, according to Steve Norwitz, spokesman for the Baltimore-based company. Much of that money has flowed into the money-market funds or T. Rowe's international bond fund, where fixed-income investors hope to benefit from the decline in the dollar, he said.    &quot;People nervous about the sudden volatility in the credit markets are retreating from long-term bonds funds, both taxable and tax-exempt, but it's hitting hardest in the tax-exempts,&quot; said Mr. Norwitz.    Mr. Atterman of Kidder Peabody said it isn't only individual investors but also portfolio managers who are turning sour on the outlook for municipals. Bond funds bought heavily last month when the market looked attractive, he said, becoming &quot;less liquid than they usually are.&quot; Now, &quot;they're trying to get back to a 6% to 8% cash position.&quot;    The Commerce Department's trade report early yesterday jolted the bond markets even though there had been widespread rumors Monday afternoon that the report would show a huge $18 billion deficit. The department said a large increase in imports helped drive up the trade gap to $15.06 billion in February from January's revised deficit of $12.27 billion.    The trade figures helped drive down the dollar in the currency markets. That heightened fears of higher inflation because a lower dollar means higher import prices. Moreover, it sparked renewed fears that Japanese investors will shy away from buying significantly large amounts of new Treasury notes and bonds.    The Treasury is scheduled April 29 to announce plans to sell a huge volume of new notes and bonds. Many analysts expect the financing package to total about $27 billion to $28 billion, consisting of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Bond traders fear that interest rates will rise further if foreign investors don't buy large amounts of these issues.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds yesterday dropped 5.29 points to close at 1313.69. That was the lowest level since Feb. 25, 1986, said Peter Campbell of Shearson. The index yesterday ranged between 1295.81 and 1326.91.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 plummeted to 88 26/32 early in the session following the trade report. However, the issue finished the day at 90 13/32, a decline from 90 21/32 Monday. The yield rose slightly to 8.38% from 8.36%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due in 1996 edged upward to 93 27/32 from 93 24/32, as the yield dipped to 8.19% from 8.20%.    Rates declined on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill declined to 5.84% bid from an average rate of 5.98% set at Monday's auction. The rate on new six-month Treasury bills declined to 6.04% bid from an auction average of 6.08%. But rates on bank certificates of deposit rose again.    The federal funds rate continued to hover around 6 1/2% amid continued speculation that the Federal Reserve System is tightening credit conditions slightly. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged only about 6 1/8% in the week ended last Wednesday.    Some analysts say the higher funds rate recently is a sign that the Fed is trying to engineer slight increases in rates in an effort to bolster the dollar. But many others insist that the Fed hasn't altered policy at all. They contend that the higher funds rate was caused merely by temporary technical factors that soon will evaporate, and that the funds rate will drift back to about 6%.    In the new-issue market, Ramada Inc. offered investors $100 million of 11 5/8% subordinated notes due 1999 at 99.50 to yield 11.70%. Salomon Brothers Inc. was the sole underwriter of the offering. </TEXT></DOC>
