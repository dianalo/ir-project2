 District Court, Central District of California,on May 25, seek an injunction against continued infringement of the patent,together with unspecified damages.andM;The patent was issued in 1977 for technology used in the MGD Metro-settypesetter.andP;  Triple-I acquired it by purchasing the MGD division fromRockwell North America in 1979.andP;  The Metro-set, introduced in 1973, storedfonts as outline data and rendered them on a CRT tube.andP;  It wasn't the firsttypesetter to store fonts in outline format, but it differed somewhat fromother devices on the market.andP;  And it received a patent for its technology.andM;Two lawsuits were earlier initiated in defense of the patent (one againstMergenthaler Linotype and one against Compugraphic), but both were settledout of court.andP;  Thus, the validity of the patent has yet to be tested incourt.andM;The latest suits specify little detail regarding alleged infringements, butwe believe the allegations relate to the method of rendering font charactersfrom outlines that are used to store font data.andM;In the case of Appel, the suit specifies technology used in the LaserWriter,not in the new font-generation scheme that will be part of Apple'snext-generation product later this year.andM;Apple might be more vulnerable on the new technology because it usesquadratics in rendering fonts, a method also used by MGD in the Metro-settypesetter for which the patent was obtained.andM;Background.andP;  We understand that preparatory work on the suit has been underthe way for well over a year, during which time Information International hasstudied the technology used by Adobe and by Apple.andP;  We also believe some ofthe parties have met to discuss the allegations.andM;Adobe denies any infringement, claiming prior art.andP;  That's the same argumentused by Mergenthaler Linotype when it was sued by Rockwell.andP;  That suitalleged infringements both on the technique of storing characters as outlinesand on the method of rendering the fonts.andP;  Although the terms of thesettlement weren't made public, it is generally believed that Linotype paidabout $4 million and received a permanent license to use the technology.andM;Three years ago, Triple-I settled a suit against Compugraphic on similarallegations.andP;  The out-of-court settlement provided for CG to pay Triple-Iabout $5 million in exchange for a license to use the technology.andP;  We believethat suit mentioned only Compugraphic's 8000, 8400 and 8600 typesetters, allof which use CRT tubes to generate characters with vertical strokes.andP;  The CG9600, which uses a raster-based laser imaging engine, wasn't mentioned in thesuit.andP;  It didn't matter for CG, since its license covers any machines it eversells, which left open the question of whether or not suits would be broughtagainst the developers of laser machines such as the Apple LaserWriter.andP;  Weare now about to see that test.andM;For further information, see The Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andO;15, No.andP;  21, p. 43, and Vol.andP;  12, No.andP;  12, p. 16.andM;The MGD story.andP;  MGD (Miehle-Goss-Dexter) was a prominent manufacturer ofprinting presses and bindery equipment.andP;  In 1969, it was acquired by RockwellNorth America, an aerospace industry manufacturer anxious to expand inhigh-technology areas.andP;  It began to develop a CRT typesetter, which in 1973became the industry's first such device selling for less than $100,000(though the price later jumped to $120,000).andM;Fonts were stored as character outlines in a manner similar to the Seaco 1600typesetter that had been developed by sun Chemical in the 1960s.andO;Technologically, there was a significant difference between the two: theSeaco unit used only straight line segments to describe each character'soutline, whereas MGD used straight lines and arc segments assembled by adescriptive formula to define the outline.andP;  Storing fonts as outlinesrequires much less data storage than earlier techniques based on storingcharacters as stroking patterns.andP;  (MGD used banks of 4K of memory tomanipulate font data; 4K held an average of 80 characters, but sometimesstored an entire font of 126 characters.)andM;There also was a difference in the way the two machines generated characterson the CRT tube from the outlines.andP;  The Seaco 1600 brought the outline dataup from disk, calculated the stroking pattern required to generate a certainpoint size, then stored the results on a small, fixed-head disk for futureuse.andM;MGD used the computer to &quot;scan&quot; the outline of the character and generate astroking pattern that would fill in the desired shape on the face of the CRTtube.andP;  Characters were generated to be set at 72 points (the largest sizesupported).andP;  For smaller sizes, some of the data for 72-point characters wasthrown away.andM;Both machines achieved the same results, but, in effect, MGD was doing withhardware what Seaco had done with software.andP;  (For more details on how the MGDmachine worked, see SRPS Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  3, and Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  3.)andM;A patent was granted to Gregory W. Evans and Robert L. Caswell on June 14,1977, for the technology used in the Metro-set.andP;  (Readers who would like acopy of the patent, number 4,029,947, can get one from the Commissioner ofPatents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231, for one dollar.andP;  Allow two orthree weeks for delivery.)andM;Prospects.andP;  Because neither of the previous lawsuits was resolved in court,it is unclear whether the Information International case will hold up in abattle.andP;  Adobe is arguing that its technology doesn't infringe on the patent,but that even if certain areas could be viewed as potentially infringing,&quot;prior art&quot; existed--such as the Seaco technology.andP;  Thus, the patent isinvalid.andP;  Mergenthaler maintained at the time it was sued that it would havebeen able to defend itself successfully against attempts to enforce thepatent, but it settled out of court to avoid a protracted legal battle.andM;We have long felt that this issue should be resolved in court once and forall.andP;  Perhaps this will be the time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
