Shamir's statements came amid reports from Washington that U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III is disillusioned over theslow pace of negotiations and may soon focus more attention onother world problems.   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot and killed a16-year-old girl in a clash with stone-throwing youths, Arabhospital officials said.   An army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,confirmed that troops opened fire on stone-throwers in the WestBank village of Bala. He said said the military was investigatinghospital reports that the teen-ager, identified as Sana Abu Zeina,was killed by the gunfire.   Also Sunday, Sami Abu Laila, 18, of the West Bank town of Nablusdied of wounds suffered in a Saturday clash with troops, hospitalofficials said.   The latest deaths raised to 600 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israeli troops or civilians in the 22-month uprisingagainst Israeli occupation. Forty Israelis also have been slain.   On Sunday, an Israeli driving near the occupied Gaza Strip wasseriously wounded in the head in a stone-throwing incident.   In an address to activists in his right-wing Likud bloc, Shamirsaid: ``I asked the president of the United States not to payattention to those that insinuate that I am running away from thepeace initiative.''   ``I'll say it now, and I'll say it 1,000 times,'' Shamir said.``That is a lie because the Likud and I within it are for a truepeace that will serve our security and interests.'' He was speakingat a rally in the southern port city of Ashdod, 25 miles south ofTel Aviv.   Shamir telephoned Bush on Tuesday night to discuss the peaceprocess.   The U.S.-Israeli contacts were reported as Shamir's governingpartners in the left-of-center Labor Party threatened to support aparliamentary motion to topple the coalition Cabinet unless heshowed more flexibility with the Americans.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens joined Shamir in urging U.S.officials not to be frustrated with the pace of talks. He, too,said Israel was aggressively pursuing negotiations.   ``I think that Mr. Baker also realizes that advancing peace inthe Middle East requires patience,'' Arens said on Israeltelevision's Arabic language service.   Shamir adviser Avi Pazner denied reports that U.S. efforts toarrange preliminary talks between Israeli and Palestinianrepresentatives had broken down in disagreement over who the Arabnegotiators would be.   ``This is not true. We are at the height of negotiations withthe Americans,'' Pazner said in a telephone interview.   His comments follow an exchange of public criticism betweenIsraeli and U.S. officials, started by Shamir's declaration lastweek that he could not be pressured by Washington to enter talkswith Palestinians.   Israel so far has dismissed efforts by Baker to arrange ameeting with Palestinians on Israel's stalled proposal forelections in the occupied territories.   Israeli officials say Baker's plan for a meeting with aPalestinian delegation would leave open a role for the PalestineLiberation Organization, which Israel views as a terrorist group.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat arrived Sunday in Cairo for talks withEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Arafat, in remarks reported bythe Middle East News Agency, described Shamir as ``Mr. No.''   The PLO Central Council also has rejected the American andIsraeli proposals, saying they are designed to impose Israel'selection plan on the Palestinians.   Pazner denied reports in Israeli newspapers Sunday that Baker ispushing Shamir for a quick reply to his proposals.   Israel's initiative, introduced in April, calls for electionsamong the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands to chooserepresentatives for peace talks with Israel on interim self-rule.The final status of the territories would be decided in later talks.</TEXT></DOC>
