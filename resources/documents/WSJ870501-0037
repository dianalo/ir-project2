TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK)ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Energy Secretary John Herrington protested a congressional move to mothball his agency's Hanford, Wash., N-reactor, a problem-plagued producer of bomb-grade plutonium.    Such an action &quot;could severely restrict the Department of Energy's ability to meet its responsibility for our nation's strategic defense capability,&quot; Mr. Herrington said in a prepared statement.    As Mr. Herrington's statement was being issued yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved an amendment that would keep the N-reactor closed through Sept. 30. The panel's senior Republican, Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, argued full safety improvements cannot be completed before then.    The action was the second legislative move in two days to keep the plant from reopening. But congressional staffers said it wasn't clear whether such efforts would dissipate as the administration raises national security concerns.    The Senate Armed Services Committee voted Wednesday to keep the reactor closed down, unless needed to meet a national security crisis. The reactor is in a six-month shutdown for safety-related repairs and improvements scheduled to end in July.    Concerns were raised about the safety of the aging reactor after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Union just over a year ago.    The N-reactor is the only water-cooled U.S. reactor in which the reaction is moderated by graphite, as in the Chernobyl reactor design. And like the Soviet plant, it lacks a thick, concrete-and-steel structure to contain radioactive materials.    Of six nuclear specialists selected by Mr. Herrington to review the N-reactor last year, five said the plant fell short of commercial nuclear safety standards; two recommended closing it unless it was needed to protect national security.    The panel highlighted the reactor's vulnerability to hydrogen explosions, weaknesses of its system to limit radioactive releases during an accident, and alleged complacency of its operators.    The Energy Department has maintained that the reactor can be operated safely and that it is needed to meet the plutonium production requirements of the Reagan administration's weapons buildup.    The reactor constitutes one-third of U.S. plutonium production capacity, the agency said.    Yesterday, agency officials warned that the reactor couldn't be restarted promptly if it remains closed after July. The difficulty of restarting the reactor, Mr. Herrington said, &quot;would undermine the flexibility of the department to meet future contingencies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
