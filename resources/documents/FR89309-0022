Through Customs Automated Commercial System (ACS),specifically its Automated Broker Interface (ABI), Customs has developeda method known as statement processing which now allows one payment tocover multiple entry summaries. Further, Customs has developed an enhancementto statement processing which no longer requires that the estimated dutiesbe attached to the submission of entry summary documentation. The enhancementis known as the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH); ACH is an electronic paymentmechnism. A filer who is on Customs ABI now may transmit his entry datato Customs through the ABI, may elect to use statement processing, andmay utilize ACH to effect payment. The entry summary documentation mustbe submitted within 10 working days after entry of the merchandise. Paymentthrough ACH for the entry summaries must be made on the same day the documentationis submitted.This document proposes that amendments be made to the Customs Regulationsproviding for the voluntary use by ABI participants of statement processing.It also proposes the requirement that payment of all ABI statements bemade through the use of the ACH electronic payment mechanism.Additionally, this document proposes that the Customs Regulations be amendedconcerning the payment of estimated duties regarding special classes ofmerchandise, consisting of quota-class merchandise and other classes designatedby Customs Headquarters. It is proposed that payment of estimated dutiesregarding these entry/entry summaries be allowed through ABI statementprocessing if the preponderance of the ABI participant's non-special classentry summaries are also processed under statement processing. As withall entry/entry summaries and entry summaries that are statement processed,these entry/entry summaries must appear on an ABI statement no later than10 working days from date of entry and must be paid using ACH.<ITAG tagnum="84">Automated Commercial System</ITAG>The Automated Commercial System (ACS) was developed to enable Customs toprocess the rapidly increasing volume of commercial importations in anefficient and expeditious manner. As part of this effort, Customs has developedautomated computer interfaces with various elements of the importing community.One of these is the Automated Broker Interface (ABI).<ITAG tagnum="84">Automated Broker Interface</ITAG>ABI is a voluntary system which pemits qualified trade participants tointerface directly with the Customs computer and transmit entry releaseand entry summary data for merchandise being imported. The ABI system speedsentry processing and provides two-way communication between the user andCustoms. In this manner, participants are able to ensure the accuracy andcompleteness of data by accessing Customs automated reference files.The ABI was designed in cooperation with the trade, making use of standardtechnology available to both large and small businesses. Users are responsiblefor developing computer programs necessary to support the functional aspectsof the system according to the specifications contained in the <T3>ABI Broker Requirements Document </T3>(Customs Publication No. 540).ABI requires that private sector systems have complete edit and verificationprograms which are utilized during entry preparation to ensure data accuracyand completeness. Costs for communications hardware, adapters, and supportingsoftware are absorbed by the ABI participants. Customs provides accessto toll-free lines for actual data transmissions.Those entities which do not interface directly with Customs are able tosubmit entries through a service bureau or port authority which will communicatewith Customs in the same way as other ABI users. One-time and occasionalimporters may elect to continue to file entries directly with Customs.The general requirements for ABI participation are as follows:andbullet; Demonstration of acceptable entry summary preparation capabilitiesin both a manual and an automated environment. andbullet; The assembly and communication of entry data in conformity withthe ABI Broker Requirements Document. andbullet; Successful completion of a period of intensive testing on theCustoms system. andbullet; The continued meeting or exceeding of Customs established errorand reject standards. Participants who become operational in the ABI may elect to process entrysummaries utilizing ABI statement processing.<ITAG tagnum="84">ABI Statement Processing </ITAG>Before ABI, pursuant to andSection; 141.101, Customs Regulations (19 CFR141.101), estimated duties were required, generally, upon submission ofthe entry documentation or the entry summary documentation, when the entrysummary served as both the entry and entry summary. This payment was usuallymade by a check covering the individual entry or the entry summary. ABIstatement processing is an option available to ABI participants. Throughstatement processing, the ABI filer elects to group entry summaries ona daily basis and pay the duties, taxes and fees on those entry summarieswith a single payment. An ABI filer using statement processing must submiton the scheduled statement date the estimated duties, taxes, and fees alongwith the related entry summary documentation. Currently, the payment of ABI statements may be accomplished through theuse of check payment to the statement processing location. Customs is nowproposing that the required method of payment for all ABI statements bethrough the use of ACH, an electronic payment mechanism.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mechanics of Statement Processing </ITAG>The mechanics of statement processing are as follows. When entry summarydata is transmitted through ABI, the filer, who has been preapproved forstatement processing, indicates whether he desires to pay a particularentry summary by an individual payment or by using statement processing.If statement processing is selected, the filer indicates if it is to bean importer or broker statement and provides a valid scheduled statementdate, not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. ABI will not warn the filer ifthe scheduled statement date given may result in late payment. The ABIfiler is responsible for ensuring that all entry/entry summaries and entrysummaries are scheduled for payment within 10 working days after the dateof entry. During the evening prior to the scheduled statement date, the ACS systemextracts the affected entries and generates a preliminary statement whichis available to the ABI participant the morning of the scheduled statementdate. The preliminary statements are to be printed by the ABI filer, whoassembles entry summary packages by grouping the required entry summariesas listed on the statement and submitting them to Customs for acceptance.If a filer must remove an entry summary appearing on a preliminary statement,he may request that it be deleted from the statement by lining the entrynumber out on the statement copy, adjusting totals and the payment amountaccordingly. The actual deletions from the ABI statement are performedby Customs through ACS; the ABI filer cannot perform the deletions. Thefiler may then pay the deleted entry(s) by individual check, or schedulethem for another statement by retransmitting the entry summary data throughABI with a future scheduled statement date. During the ACS ``end-of-day'' processing, a final statement is generatedfor each preliminary statement where payment has been accepted. The filerprints the final statement which is a permanent record of the entry summariesand the related duty, tax, and fee amounts actually paid. The final statementwill also provide the filer a listing of any entries which may have beendeleted from the preliminary statement at the request of the filer.<ITAG tagnum="84">Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) </ITAG>The ACH process is a payment method for use by operational ABI filers toeffect payment of ABI statements. The ACH is similar to a bank lockboxarrangement. Instead of the payment being made by check, however, the participantwill electronically provide Customs authorization to notify a specificTreasury-designated ACH processor to perform an electronic debit to itsbank account, wherever the account is currently located. The payment amountwill subsequently be credited to the account of the Treasury. The ACH process requires that the ABI statement filer provide to Customsin writing the bank transit routing number and the bank account numberfrom which the ACH payments will be electronically debited by the Treasury-designatedACH processor. The information can be obtained from the bottom of the relatedcheck or by inquiring of the bank where the account is on file. Customswill prepare a Masterfile Maintenance Form which will be provided to theTreasury-designated ACH processor containing the account information witha unique participant unit number assigned by Customs. A copy of the maintenanceform will be provided to the ABI filer identifying this unique number.All future ACH payment authorizations transmitted by the ABI filer mustidentify this unique number which will alert the Treasury-designated ACHprocessor as to the bank and account to which to issue the electronic debittransaction. If more than one account is to be used, the ABI filer mustnotify Customs so that unique numbers can be assigned to each account andthe Treasury-designated ACH processor will have the information in theirfiles for appropriate action. It will be the responsibility of the ABIparticipant to ensure that all bank account information is accurate andthat the correct unique participant number is utilized in each ACH paymentauthorization transaction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of ACH on Statement Processing </ITAG>The following overview shows the effect on statement processing resultingfrom the ACH payment process. The preliminary statement will be generated in the current manner and availableto the ABI filer on the morning of the scheduled statement date. This processwill allow the ABI filer to identify any entry deletions which are to beremoved from the statement. These deletions will be accomplished by Customsat the statement processing location before payment action is accomplished.When the preliminary statement has been verified by both Customs and theABI filer, Customs wil freeze the preliminary statement to prevent subsequentmanipulation from occurring prior to the receipt of the ACH payment. TheABI filer will then transmit to Customs through the ABI the ACH paymentauthorization for that statement. If by the close of business on the preliminary statement date the statementhas not been frozen, the ACS system will automatically freeze the preliminarystatement. If the preliminary statement is frozen by Customs without havingperformed any necessary deletions, the ABI participant should immediatelynotify the statement processing location so that deletions will be performed.Currently, ABI participants are utilizing the ACH system by initiatingpayment transactions through a Treasury-designated ACH processor. In thenear future, ABI participants will have the capability of remitting paymenttransactions directly to Customs for subsequent processing through theACH system. When this capability is available to the ABI filer, the notificationof acceptance of the ACH payment authorization will be transmitted to thefiler through the ABI. Upon acceptance of the ACH payment authorizationtransaction by Customs, the statement will be identified as paid, and Customs,in the course of its normal end-of-day processing, will post the appropriatepayment amounts (duties, taxes, fees) to the related entries. Customs will electronically debit, through the Treasury-designated ACHprocessor, the payor's account on the second business day following theaccepted payment date provided in the ABI acceptance notification record.The final statement will be available to the participant the morning followingacceptance of the ACH payment authorization by Customs. The ABI filer will also receive through ABI a notification that an ACHpayment authorization cannot be accepted. The ABI filer will be given anerror narrative(s) identifying the error(s) that were in the original authorizationtransmission. If the participant receives the ABI notification that theoriginal payment authorization record contained errors, no payment willhave been applied to the statement and the authorization cannot be providedto the Treasury-designated ACH processor for processing. It is the responsibilityof the participant to timely retransmit a corrected authorization recordor risk the potential of late payment claims on each statement entry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement Processing and ACH Transmission </ITAG>Entry presentation and processing will require discipline and supervisoryoversight in both the ABI filers' and Customs offices to ensure timelytransmission of ACH payments. All preliminary statement entries are to be presented to Customs on thedate of the preliminary statement. The ABI filer will indicate what, ifany, deletions are to be performed. Customs will not initiate any deletionson its own. Customs will perform the deletions. After any deletions areprocessed, Customs will reconcile the statement and provide summary informationto the ABI participant. Customs will then freeze the preliminary statementat the reconciled amount, thereby preventing further manipulation to thestatement prior to ACH payment. When there are no deletions to be performedto the preliminary statement, Customs will simply freeze the preliminarystatement, as originally presented. It will be the responsibility of theABI filer to ensure that the ACH transmission via ABI is accomplished byclose of business on the scheduled statement date. As previously noted, Customs will electronically debit, through the Treasury-designatedprocessor, the payor's account on the second business day following theaccepted payment date, as provided in the ABI acceptance notification record.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement Processing and Special Classes of Merchandise </ITAG>Special classes of merchandise defined in andSection; 142.13(c) (1) and (2),Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.13(c) (1) and (2)), consist of quota-classmerchandise and other classes of merchandise designated by Customs Headquarters.Entry/entry summaries for these special classes of merchandise currentlyare not eligible to be statement processed. This document proposes to givean ABI filer who uses statement processing as a normal course of businessan option to include such entry/entry summaries on a statement. However,if the filer chooses to use statement processing for those entry/entrysummaries, they must remain on the statement. As discussed earlier in thisdocument, ACH will be the required method of payment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of Statement Processing on Quota Status and Priority </ITAG>``Quota priority'' as defined in andSection; 132.1(f), Customs Regulations(19 CFR 132.1(f)), is the precedence granted to one entry, or withdrawalfrom warehouse, for consumption of quota-class merchandise over other entriesor withdrawals of merchandise subject to the same quota. ``Quota status''as defined in andSection; 132.1(g), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 132.1(g)),is the standing which entitles quota-class merchandise to admission underan absolute quota, or to a reduced rate of duty under a tariff-rate quota,or to any other quota benefit. Under the current system, quota priority and status are determined as ofthe time of presentation to Customs of the entry/entry summary for consumption,or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption. The time of presentationis generally the time of delivery in proper form of an entry summary forconsumption, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, withestimated duties attached, or a withdrawal for consumption, with estimatedduties attached. The quota status of a commodity subject to a tariff-rate quota cannot bedetermined in advance of the entry. The quota rates of duty are ordinarilyassessed on such commodities entered from the beginning of the quota perioduntil such time in the period as it is determined that imports are nearingthe quota level. District Directors of Customs are then instructed to requirethe deposits of estimated duties at the over-quota duty rate and to reportthe time of official presentation of each entry. A final determinationof the date and time when a quota is filled is made, and all district directorsare advised accordingly. This document proposes that an ABI filer using statement processing mayinclude quota-class merchandise on a statement. Customs is also proposingthat quota status and quota priority can be acquired without estimatedduties being attached to the entry/entry summary documentation. This canoccur when Customs successfully receives from the ABI filer via ABI a transmissionof entry/entry summary information and a valid scheduled statement datefor the subsequent payment of duties, taxes and fees. It should be notedthat the proposed amendments do not intend to change the requirement thatan entry summary for consumption must be presented to Customs for quota-classmerchandise to obtain quota status. Merely transmitting the entry/entrysummary information to Customs via ABI and paying by statement processingis not sufficient. It also should be noted that it is not proposed to changethe requirement that estimated duties must be attached to withdrawals fromwarehouse for consumption for such quota-class merchandise to obtain quotastatus and priority. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of Statement Processing on Release of Special Classes of Merchandise</ITAG>Section 141.101, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.101), currently providesthat estimated duties must be deposited at the time of the filing of theentry summary documentation when it serves as both the entry and entrysummary. Section 142.13(c), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 142.13(c)), providesthat estimated duties must be attached to the entry summary documentationbefore quota-class merchandise and other special classes of merchandisedesignated by Customs Headquarters can be released. This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to allow such merchandiseto be released without the estimated duties being attached to the entry/entrysummary documentation, if Customs successfully receives from the ABI filervia ABI a transmission of the entry/entry summary information and a validscheduled statement date for subsequent payment of duties, taxes and fees.Processing of these entries generally requires pre-release review for assuranceof statistical accuracy or compliance with special entry requirements ontrade sensitive commodities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Proposed Changes </ITAG>This document proposes to amend sections of Parts 24, 132, 141, 142 and143 of the Customs Regulations. An amendment proposed to andSection; 24.1states that ABI participants may elect to pay duties, taxes and other chargesthrough statement processing and, if so, such payment must be electronicallythrough ACH. It is proposed to create a andSection; 24.25 that describesstatement processing. Various sections of Part 132 are proposed to be amendedto reflect that statement processing of quota entries is permitted andthat quota status and priority can be granted to those entries withoutthe attachment of estimated duties, taxes and fees. It is also proposedto amend andSection; 142.13(c) to state that ABI filers filing entry/entrysummaries for other special classes of merchandise designated by CustomsHeadquarters may use the statement processing method. Numerous other sectionsof the regulations in Parts 141, 142 and 143 are also proposed to be amendedto reflect that estimated duties need not be attached to entry/entry summariesand entry summaries for consumption if Customs successfully receives fromthe ABI filer via ABI a transmission of entry/entry summary informationand a valid scheduled statement date. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any writtencomments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be availablefor public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4 Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4),and andSection; 103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regularbusiness days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulationsand Disclosure Law Branch, Room 2119, U.S. Customs Service Headquarters,1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), it is certified that if adopted, the proposed amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.

Users of statement processingmust pay Customs duties, taxes and fees electronically through the AutomatedClearinghouse. 3. It is proposed to amend Part 24 by adding a new andSection; 24.25 to readas follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 24.25 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Statement processing. </ITAG>Statement processing is a voluntary automated program for participantsin the Automated Broker Interface (ABI), allowing the grouping of entry/entrysummaries and entry summaries on a daily basis. The related duties, taxesand fees must be paid electronically through the Automated Clearinghouse(ACH) with a single payment. (a) <T3>How to elect participation.</T3> An ABI filer must notify Customs inwriting of the intention to utilize statement processing. All ABI statementsmust be paid electronically through ACH. The ABI filer must provide toCustoms the bank transit routing number and the bank account number foreach account from which the ACH payments will be electronically debited.Upon the determination by Customs that the ABI filer has the necessarysoftware to participate and otherwise qualifies to participate, Customsshall assign a unique identifying number to the participant and providethat number to both the participant and the Treasury-designated ACH processor.This unique number assigned by Customs will alert the ACH processor asto which bank and account to issue the electronic debit. It is the responsibilityof the participant to ensure that all bank account information is accurateand that the correct unique participant number is utilized for each ACHtransaction. (b) <T3>Automated Clearinghouse.</T3> A filer using ABI statement processingmust make payment electronically through the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH).ACH is an arrangement in which the filer electronically provides paymentauthorization for the Treasury-designated ACH processor to perform an electronicdebit to the payor's bank account. The payment amount will then be automaticallycredited to the account of the Department of the Treasury. (c) <T3>Procedure for filer. </T3>(1) The filer shall transmit entry/entrysummary and entry summary data through ABI indicating whether payment fora particular entry summary will be by individual check or by using statementprocessing. If statement processing is indicated, the filer shall designatewhether the entry summary is to be grouped by importer or broker, and shallprovide a valid scheduled statement date (not a Saturday, Sunday or holiday).(2) Customs shall provide a preliminary statement to the ABI filer on thescheduled statement date. The preliminary statement shall contain all entry/entrysummaries and entry summaries scheduled for that statement date. The preliminarystatement shall be printed by the filer, who will review the statemententries, and the statement totals, assemble the required entry summariesas listed in the statement, and present them to Customs with the preliminarystatement. This presentation to Customs shall be on the date of the preliminarystatement. If a filer elects to perform deletions from the preliminarystatement (other than items related to special classes of merchandise providedfor in andSection; 142.13(c) of this chapter), the filer shall notify Customsin such manner as designated by Customs Headquarters. Any entry numberdeleted from a statement may be paid by an individual check or scheduledfor another statement by transmitting the entry summary data through ABIwith a future payment date.(3) When the preliminary statement is presented to Customs by the filer,Customs shall freeze the preliminary statement to prevent subsequent manipulationfrom occurring prior to the receipt of the ACH payment. If the filer doesnot present the preliminary statement by close of business on the scheduledstatement date, Customs shall freeze the statement.(4) Customs shall notify the filer when the preliminary statement is frozen.If the preliminary statement is frozen by Customs without having performedpreviously requested deletions, the ABI filer should immediately notifythe statement processing location and the deletions will be performed.It is the responsibility of the filer to transmit the ACH payment authorizationthrough ABI for that statement by no later than the close of business onthe scheduled statement date.(5) Upon acceptance of the ACH payment authorization transactions by Customs,the preliminary statement shall be identified as paid and Customs shallpost the appropriate payment amounts to the related entries. The finalstatement generally shall be available to the filer the day following theacceptance of the ACH payment.(d) <T3>Choice of excluding certain entries from statement processing. </T3>Afiler, generally, has the right to inform Customs electronically whetherhe desires that a particular entry summary be paid by an individual paymentrather than through statement processing. Entry/entry summaries for specialclasses of merchandise defined in andSection; 142.13(c) of this chapter arenot requried to be statement processed, but the filer has the option ofincluding such entry/entry summaries. However, if statement processingis used for these special classes of merchandise, they cannot be deletedfrom a statement. In order to include entry/entry summaries for specialclasses of merchandise on a statement, a filer must use statement processingfor a preponderance of the filer's non-special class entry summaries. IfCustoms determines that the preponderance of the non-special class entrysummaries are not being processed through statement processing, the filercan be disqualified from using statement processing.(e) <T3>Scheduled statement date. </T3>Entry/entry summaries and entry summariesmust be designated for statement processing within 10 working days afterthe date of entry. It is the responsibility of the ABI filer using statementprocessing to ensure that the elected scheduled statement date is withinthat 10-day time frame.
