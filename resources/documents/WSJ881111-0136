Richard Munro, Time's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;Time Inc. intends to be one of these companies,&quot; by becoming vertically integrated in the television and entertainment business and expanding aggressively outside the U.S., he added.    &quot;We've seen Sony, Hachette, Bertelsmann, Rupert Murdoch and Maxwell all playing the world-wide game,&quot; Mr. Munro said, referring to recent acquisitions by foreign companies in the U.S. &quot;A few American companies better start playing a world-wide game, or we will be in second place.&quot;    However, Time executives said they aren't willing to pay the same high prices as some of the foreign concerns. N.J. Nicholas, Time's president, said Time believes Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Maxwell Communication Corp. &quot;dramatically overpaid&quot; for their respective purchases of Triangle Publications Inc. and Macmillan Inc. recently.    Mr. Munro and Mr. Nicholas declined to be more specific at the meeting about possible acquisition candidates. The executives also declined comment on Time's previously reported merger talks with Warner Communications Inc. But Time and Warner executives have privately acknowledged that the two held extensive merger discussions and haven't ruled out an eventual resumption of such talks.    In response to questions about recent speculation that the company is vulnerable to a takeover, Mr. Munro also told analysts that Time is &quot;determined to remain an independent company.&quot; As previously reported, analysts have criticized Time because of the sizable gap between its estimated asset value and its stock price.    While Mr. Nicholas said the company is &quot;mindful of the gap,&quot; Time isn't &quot;going to make deals for the sake of satisfying other people's expectations of what we should or should not be doing,&quot; he said.    Time executives also told analysts the company is comfortable with their estimates that the company will earn between $5.80 per share and $6.50 per share in 1989. Earlier this year, Time said it was comfortable with Wall Street projections that the company would earn $5.10 to $5.40 per share in 1988. Yesterday, a Time spokesman said the company expects the 1988 earnings to be closer to the higher range of estimates, or between $5.25 and $5.40 per share.    Time reported 1987 earnings of $250 million, or $4.18 per share.    Mr. Munro also said Time is considering an increase in its quarterly dividend and may extend its current share buy-back plan beyond the 10 million shares already authorized. Time currently has a 25 cent quarterly payout, and hasn't increased the dividend since 1985. The company has purchased about 7.7 million shares under the current buy-back plan.    Time said its magazine group expects a modest increase in earnings in 1988 over last year, although a tough advertising climate, postal rate increases and increased paper costs cut into profit by $43 million. But Time added that advertising revenue should be up 8% in 1988 over last year, and circulation revenue should increase 6% in 1988.    Michael Fuchs, chief executive of Time's Home Box Office unit, said the pay-television network expects profit to grow at 10% annually, but said much of the unit's future growth will come from new businesses such as videocassette distribution and the production and syndication of TV programs world-wide.    In the books group, Time said 1988 earnings should exceed $100 million this year, a 13% increase over last year.    Time stock rose $1 yesterday to close at $105.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
