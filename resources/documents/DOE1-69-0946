Characterized in the geologic past by extensiveshallow seas with adjacent broad lowlands and warm climatic periods,the Arctic was the site of accumulation of extensive petroleum and coaldeposits. The full extent and magnitude of these reserves will remainspeculative long into the future as exploration and development continue.The accelerating development of resources is bringing about increasedand new pressures on the biological systems of the Arctic. The past decadeand a half has seen the discovery and development of a giant oil fieldat Prudhoe Bay in the Alaskan Arctic with the associated constructionacross Alaska of a 1288 km, large diameter pipeline. The pipeline projectdwarfed all previous commercial construction projects and set new precedentsfor the concurrent protection of environmental values. Oil and gas explorationin the Canadian Arctic has become a major stimulus to the economy anddevelopment of the region. Plans are underway for the development ofpipelines and other transportation systems to bring these remote energyreserves to markets thousands of kilometers to the south. Explorationfor petroleum products is accelerating in other regions of the Arctic.Exploratory wells have been drilled off the west coast of Greenland andon Svalbard (Spitzbergen), but no significant petroleum discoveries havebeen made. In the Soviet Arctic, oil and gas exploration is widespreadbut largely limited to areas where transportation does not pose a seriousproblem. Several pipelines for transportation of oil and natural gashave been constructed north of the Arctic Circle in the Soviet Unionbut most are relatively short lines built to bring these fossil fuelsto nearby industrial or population centers.</TEXT></DOC>
