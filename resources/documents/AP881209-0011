Gorbachev has never shown any reason to bemistrusted and in fact is steering the Kremlin away from its oldgoal of ``a one-world communist state.''   In what was probably his final White House news conference,Reagan said ``trust but verify'' remains his byword in dealing withthe Russians, but he offered an optimstic assessment of howU.S.-Soviet relations stand at the end of his eight-year tenure inoffice.   ``The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' hesaid.   For half an hour, Reagan fielded questions Thursday night in anEast Room decorated with Christmas trees hung with silver tinsel. Hesaid it was the Russians _ not he _ who have changed, but his oldanti-communist fire was dampened.   On a pressing domestic issue, Reagan said he would be ``deeplydisappointed'' if President-elect Bush, after assuming office nextmonth, raised taxes to help cut the deficit, which grew to $155billion this year.   But he quickly added, ``I don't think it's going to happen.''   The chief executive also told reporters the United Statesultimately will have to negotiate with Iran to win release ofAmerican hostages in Lebanon. ``We would be ready to talk withthem,'' he said of the Iranians.   In addition, he said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat did not go farenough in saying his organization accepts the existence of Israel asa state and condemns terrorism in all forms.   ``He has left openings for himself where he can deny that hemeant this or meant that, that sounded so clean-cut,'' Reagan said.   On a day after his fifth and final meeting with Gorbachev, Reaganopened the meeting with reporters by reading a warm statement on thestate of superpower relations.   Asked if he believed Gorbachev was trying to make the SovietUnion a less threatening nation, Reagan replied without hesitation,``Yes, I do.   ``And I think he recognizes that their massive buildup has beenresponsible for the great economic crisis that he faces there in theSoviet Union,'' Reagan said.   Asked point-blank if he trusted Gorbachev, Reagan said, ``Hehasn't shown me any reason yet that I shouldn't.''   However, Reagan said the motto ``trust but verify'' is one thatproperly guides Soviet policy, too, and said he did not thinkGorbachev ``would gamble on believing that he shouldn't protect hisown interests, also.''   Whether or not the United States and Soviet Union ever becomeallies, as they were during World War II, Reagan said it wasentirely up to the Kremlin.   It could happen, he said, ``if it can be definitely establishedthat they no longer are following the expansionist policy that wasinstituted in the communist revolution that their goal must be aone-world communist state.''   The president said ``certainly there are indications'' theKremlin is moving that way.   ``I do think that there is evidence that they don't like beingthe pariah, that they might want to join the family of nations andjoin them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace.''He said he would like to see that happen.   Reagan seemed cool to Gorbachev's call for a ceasefire inAfghanistan, followed by a United Nations-sponsored peacekeepingforce and broad-based government. ``I'm not sure the U.N. would likethat or that the U.N. is prepared to do such a thing,'' Reagan said.   Moreover, he said it would be unacceptable to stop arming theAfghan rebels unless the Soviet-backed regime ended militaryoperations.   The president said he was ``very grateful'' for Gorbachev'sannouncement of a 500,000 cutback in Soviet troop strength but saidMoscow still would have superiority in conventional weapons.   Reagan also expressed confidence that Bush believed as he doesthat Contra forces fighting the government of Nicaragua are freedomfighters and worthy of continued U.S. support.   On the subject of American hostages in Lebanon, Reagan said theUnited States ultimately would have to negotiate with Iran becausethe Iranians control the kidnappers.   Concerning that prospect, he said, ``There are conditions thathave to be met also there. Anytime that they are ready to comeforward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them.''   ``We cannot enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind ofransom to pay or you're just encouraging more hostage-taking. Butthere are other channels,'' he said.   Later, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater elaborated: ``We'll be glad totalk, but we've never been able to get them to do that.''   Reflecting on the highs and lows of his presidency, Reagan saidhis ``greatest burden'' was to have to order troops into ``danger... to where their lives are threatened, to where their lives aretaken.'' He later expanded that, noting the continued captivity ofhostages in the Middle East.   His greatest joy, he said without hesitation, was the economicrecovery _ the longest ever during peacetime.   Fitzwater refused to say the news conference was Reagan's lastone, but Nancy Reagan said it was.</TEXT></DOC>
