The weather phenomenon known as El Nino, which hasdeveloped in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, tends tooccur every three to five years. It's characterized byabnormally warm ocean water, weakening winds blowing fromeast to west, and by intensified precipitation and cloudcover.</LP><TEXT>   At a news conference, David Rodenhuis, director of theweather service's climate-analysis center, called El Nino&quot;probably the most important climate event beyond the annualcycle&quot; of winter, spring, summer and fall.   Officials said the phenomenon probably would bring morerainfall than normal in Texas and along the Gulf andSoutheast coasts. Some areas in the Southwest already havereceived 200% to 1,000% of their normal precipitation for thefive weeks since the beginning of December. But VernonKousky, a research meteorologist for the weather service,said that &quot;individual weather events&quot; such as the recentflooding in Texas can't be directly attributed to El Nino.   Below-normal temperatures are forecast for the Gulf Coastfrom Texas to Florida and part way up the East Coast. Thenorthern U.S. is expected to be warmer than usual.   The Northwest is likely to be dry, with less precipitationthan usual also predicted for the Ohio Valley.   Like any respectable weather forecaster, the officialsleft a big margin for error: El Nino sometimes causes heavyrains in California and sometimes drought, they said. Inaddition, there are large sections of the country that haveequal chances of above-normal or below-normal precipitationor temperatures.   Moreover, they pointed out that some of the expectedconsequences haven't shown up yet, such as the heavyprecipitation El Nino would usually drop on Florida.   El Nino generally makes itself known overseas as well asin the U.S. Conditions are likely to be dry over thePhilippines, Indonesia and northern Australia, officialssaid. Conversely, some desert regions of South America getprecipitation only during El Nino periods.   The unusual conditions typically last for 12 to 18 months.The officials said they expect the current period to peaksome time in the next six months, with conditions graduallyreturning to normal by late this year or the beginning of1993.   El Nino was the name given by South American fishermen tochanges in temperature and rainfall around Christmas. It isSpanish for child, a term often used to refer to the babyJesus. It has been noticed since the time of theConquistadors. An unusually wet season, in fact, apparentlyhelped Pizarro cross normally desert areas in what is nowPeru.</TEXT></DOC>
