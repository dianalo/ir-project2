(Products).andO;Product:   SAI Systems Laboratories SAI 486/33 EISA (Workstation).andO;Topic:     EvaluationWorkstationsExtended Industry Standard Architecture.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographtable.andO;Caption:   Spec sheet. (table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Potential Stays, Price DropsandM;SAI's 486/33 EISA system is narrowing the price gap between EISA and ISAcomputers.andP;  While similarly equipped EISA machines sell for about $7,000 to$10,000, SAI asks $6,094 for all this: 8MB of memory; 256K cache; dual Teacfloppy drives; a 170MB Maxtor ESDI drive with a DTC bus mastering cachingcontroller equipped with 1MB of disk caching RAM; a Diamond SpeedStar SuperVGA card with 1MB of video memory; an ADI Super VGA monitor; a Focuskeyboard; and DOS 4.01.andM;The 486/33 EISA's components are wrapped in a desktop-style case with amodernistic front panel containing status LEDs and turbo and reset buttons.andO;Under the facade, the chassis is basic AT design.andP;  Three half-height bayspoke through the front panel and are occupied by the Teac 1.44MB and 1.2MBfloppy drives.andP;  Another two half-height bays, hidden beneath the front panel,are adjacent to these, and SAI has chosen to occupy both with a singlefull-height Maxtor ESDI drive.andP;  An LSI 200-watt power supply is ample for theinstalled devices and should carry you through most expansions.andM;SAI has commissioned an intelligently thought out Advanced IntegrationResearch (AIR) motherboard with a Phoenix BIOS and Intel chip set for itscomputer.andP;  The AIR motherboard provides 16 SIMM slots, meaning that this 8MBcomputer can be expanded to 16MB with 1MB SIMM modules, or 64MB with 4MBmodules.andP;  The board also contains eight EISA slots; and, while strict ISAbackward compatibility is enforced by running the bus at 8MHz, you can jumpthe bus to run at 10MHz if compatibility isn't an issue for you.andP;  Paralleland serial ports are built into the motherboard, so six slots are actuallyavailable for expansion after inserting the video and disk controller boards.andM;SAI's choice of a DTC bus-mastering hard drive controller deserves specialmention.andP;  This is an ESDI caching controller with 1MB of cache RAM thataccounts for $895 of the system cost.andP;  With the faster data transfer rate ofthe ESDI drive, the data-swallowing potential of the cache gives you roughly25 to 58 percent performance improvement--depending on the amount of datatransferred and whether it fits into the cache--over typical IDE hard drivesin ISA machines.andP;  You can opt for a non-caching controller (you'll still getESDI) and save the $895.andP;  Granted, the performance won't be asspectacular--probably a 10 to 15 percent improvement over IDE--but you'll payunder $5,000 for the computer.andM;The Diamond Speedstar VGA card, on the other hand, is an ISA card.andP;  While ISAcards will function normally in EISA slots, they don't take advantage of theEISA bus.andP;  You can expect fast performance from this card and its Tseng BIOSthanks, in part, to the BIOS shadowing SAI employs.andP;  Coupled to the ADI SuperVGA monitor, color is accurate and images are stable, even at the 1,024- by768-pixel maximum resolution.andM;Low cost often means corner cutting, either in the computer itself or in thedocumentation.andP;  That is not the case here.andP;  The manual is well-written andloaded with usable information about setting up the system and avoidingpossible pitfalls.andP;  This is a major improvements over SAI's pastdocumentation efforts.andM;Due to early compatibility problems between EISA slots and EISA cards, youmay be wary of buying any EISA machine.andP;  SAI has a 30-day money-back returnpolicy, plenty of time to make sure the computer works with the EISA boardsyou want to run.andP;  During and after that period, questions are fielded bySAI's support team.andP;  The call isn't toll free.andP;  Fortunately, the support teamwon't keep you waiting long for an answer.andM;SAI has added to the usual one-year parts warranty a three-year warranty onlabor.andP;  The basic coverage extends to phone diagnostic and parts shippingonly, but there is an optional on-site policy available for $149 on thisconfiguration of the machine.andP;  Other configurations will vary, and extendedservice contracts are also available on a case-by-case basis.andM;The SAI 486/33 EISA's FCC Class A rating makes it a suitable candidate foryour office.andP;  It certainly deserves your vote.andM;SUMMARYandM;Low pricing and name-brand components mark SAI's excellently performing EISAbus computer as an equally excellent buy.andM;SPEC SHEETandM;SAI Systems Laboratories 911 Bridgeport Ave. Shelton, CT 06484andM;Sales Information: 800-331-0488, 203-929-0790, 9 a.m.andP;
