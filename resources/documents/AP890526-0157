De Mita (through translator): Mr. President, I extend to you,also on behalf of the Italian people, my most sincere and warmwelcome.   We particularly appreciate your visit at the beginning of achallenging mission in Europe.   In this visit, we perceive the token of that special anddeep-rooted relationship binding the United States and Italythrough a sincere friendship and a strong alliance.   Furthermore, Mr. President, Italy is aware of your personalcommitment to the search for peace, and for the defense of humanrights throughout the world.   This commitment lives up to the best and highest U.S. traditionand makes you a particularly welcome guest for the entire Italianpeople.   You arrive in a Europe where the winds of change are blowing.   The outstanding events occurring in Eastern Europe countries andthe achievements of ``Community Europe'' have generated elements ofmovement which open new prospects.   It is up to us to grasp their meaning and channel them for thebest for our peoples and for peace.   Time has come to view these changes with courage, withoutrelinquishing the vigorous loyalty to the ideals upon which ourfree societies are founded.   As times are changing, the solidarity between Europe and theUnited States, between Italy and the United States, based on athorough sharing of values remains a cornerstone and a prerequisitefor facing these very changes.   I am convinced that your visit will contribute to strengthen ourfriendship, and it is in this spirit that I have the pleasure ofwelcoming you to Italy.</TEXT><TEXT>   Bush: Well, let me begin by thanking all of you and my personalfriend, my good friend, Prime Minister De Mita, for welcoming us toItaly at this late hour.   Since ancient times, the saying goes, ``All roads lead toRome,'' and that's still true.   And it is very fitting that here I begin my first step on thisfirst trip to Europe as president of the United States.   Italy has long been a wellspring of Western culture and Westernvalues, fostering the alliance in a more unified Europe.   I hope that our visit to Rome will demonstrate just how stronglythe United States respects and appreciates Italy's role as astaunch ally and as a constant friend.   When our calm and security has been threatened, you have beenready to strengthen the alliance.   And when Europe appeared ready to loosen the ties that sustainedit, you've kept those important trans-Atlantic ties alive andstrong.   And when conflict has threatened, you have been in the frontranks of those searching for solutions.   The bond between the United States and Italy runs deep.   It's a bond of family, of culture, of shared interests andcommon vision.   And the world around us is changing, but we can be sure that ourfriendship will endure.   Mr. Prime Minister, when we last met, we talked of newdevelopments around the world, of change in the East, of newopportunities for arms reductions, of the growing unity of Europe;and in recent weeks, I've spoken of America's vision for worldpeace.   I have said that we are prepared to move beyond containmenttoward a policy that works to bring the Soviet Union into thecommunity of nations.   We will be actively engaged in Eastern Europe, promotingmeasures to encourage political and economic liberalization inPoland.   The United States welcomes a stronger and more united Europe.   We believe, as I know you do, that European unity and thetrans-Atlantic partnership reinforce each other.   Over the next two days, we'll have the opportunity to engage inrenewed dialogue as partners, certainly as friends.   And I hope that our conversations are shaped by our sharedexpectations for the future and by our determination to see ourfuture succeed.   I am delighted to be back in Rome.   Thank you again for this warm welcome.</TEXT></DOC>
