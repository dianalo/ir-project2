Davies SymphonyHall.   ``Its performance is staggering,'' the 33-year-old co-founder ofApple Computer Inc. said as students, industry executives andpotential software contributors wildly cheered.   Jobs founded Next Inc. in 1985 after leaving Apple in a powerstruggle with John Sculley, the chairman and chief executiveofficer.   Jobs, a college dropout, said his long-awaited computer would beavailable to universities by April of next year at a price around$6,500, about twice early estimates. It eventually will sell forcommercial use at about $10,000, but Jobs would not say when itwould be made available to the general public.   A special laser printer, featuring the highest resolutioncapabilities in the industry, will be sold along with the Next for$2,000.   ``This is going to be the biggest little computer in theworld,'' said Greg Stephens, an independent Santa Clara, Calif.,software specialist.   Stewart Alsop, the influential publisher of the P.C. Newsletter,called the machine a ``landmark computer.''   ``Over time, it will change the way people look at computers ...that's the innovation here, that's what all the hype is about,''Alsop said after the presentation.   But Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, William H. Gates, has deridedthe Next, saying it represents little in the way of innovation.   ``What's novel about it? Is it as much of an advance as the Mac(Apple Macintosh) was with its graphics interface? Is it marketedto a broad enough part of the market?'' he asked, implying it wasneither.   One thing it lacks is a color monitor, although Jobs said onewould be available in about a year.   To those in attendance at the demonstration, the software wasthe biggest innovation.   Using its own distinctive set of symbols, the Next is easy toprogram, allowing college professors, for example, to designillustrations of complex scientific principles according to theirown needs.   The Next uses a simplified version of Unix, the standardoperating system for advanced workstations.   Among other things, it allowed Jobs during Wednesday'sdemonstration to recreate the sounds of a thunderstorm; MartinLuther King Jr.'s ``I Had a Dream'' speech; and a speech from JohnF. Kennedy, all computer-generated.   In an agreement also announced Wednesday, International BusinessMachines Corp. has licensed the right to use the symbols andcommands developed by Next and probably will use the technology onIBM computers that run Unix. The New York Times said last monththat IBM paid $10 million for the license.   The agreement with IBM will solve one of Jobs' biggest problems,getting software writers to convert programs to a single system.This way they will be able to make sales to users of both Next andIBM computers.   Although the Next initially will be available only touniversities, analysts expect Jobs to aggressively move into othermarkets within a few years.   ``He's seeding for the future,'' said Bruce Lupatkin, seniortechnology analyst at San Francisco-based Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc.   ``There was a lot of hype and anticipation about this thing ...and Jobs has lived up to all those expectations,'' Lupatkin added.   One of the biggest innovations in hardware was a robot-builtstreamlined printed circuit board only 1-foot square that Jobs saidpacks enough power and speed to approach mainframe computercapabilites. He called it the world's most compact circuit board, adevice which runs any computer.   Each board is built in 20 minutes at a factory in Fremont, someby robots with vision and others that can place up to 150 parts perminutes, Jobs said.   The Next comes in a black magnesium case, with a tilt-up,17-inch screen.   Data is stored on a device that is similar to a compact discplayer but uses a disc that can be erased and rewritten upon. Nextsaid the device, supplied by Canon Inc., has about 50 times thestorage capacity of competitive products.   ``Once or twice in a decade something like this comes along andI believe it's going to change the future of computing ... Next isincredibly great,'' said Jobs.   The Next will compete with such hot-selling technicalworkstations as those from Sun Microsytems Inc., Apollo ComputerInc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Some of those companies are working onsimilar products that eventually will be sold for about $15,000.   Apollo's manager of educational business, Pierre Bouchard, saidin a prepared statement Wednesday that ``Jobs has a lot of catchingup to do'' in the university market. ``Big software companies maynot be willing to take the time and money to (adapt) to his system,an untested concept,'' Bouchard said.   At a news conference after the demonstration, Jobs said softwareby Adobe Systems Inc. and other companies gives the Nextexceptionally vivid graphics, offering photo-like realism andnumerous type fonts and sizes.   The Next is built around three chips from Motorola Inc.,including the 68030 microprocessor, a math chip and a signalprocessing chip. It also has connections to industry-standardnetwork called Ethernet that will allow Next to share files withother types of computers; Mathematica software, of special use forsophisticated math equations; and built-in reference sources,including a dictionary and the complete works of Shakespeare.</TEXT></DOC>
