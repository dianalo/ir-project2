It was,of course, a frustrating effort, especially when I tried to remember what Iread from ages 7 to 11. But ever since that deliberate attempt, early books orparts of books have come floating back to me. The greater part of them areabout the sea. Perhaps the sea is an apt subject for early reading becausewhen the land ends sensible adults must become as amazed as children, subjectto an element as fluid and unfathomable as much of life is to a child. Andyet, child readers (I think I remember this, but perhaps learned it from mychildren) prefer their fantasy to be built of solids.;   After reading thisbouquet of children's books my chief reaction is sympathy for the writers whoset out to write for children, especially for 6-to-10-year-olds. I have fourdaughters (22, 20, 7 and 1) and the three that I've read to have tastes asvarious and changing as channels in the Mississippi. (The only taste the threeshared is one that I cannot -- Judy Blume.) Maud, the oldest, loved horsebooks, Beatrix Potter, Laura Ingalls Wilder, Kipling and Tolkien. Nellwouldn't sit still for these, and once, when she saw me coming book in hand,she said, &quot;Oh no! Not another book you loved when you were my age.&quot; But shewas one who adored &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth,&quot; which I'd never liked until shemade me read it aloud over and over. And she turned Clare (now 7) onto RoaldDahl.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Arts andamp; Books  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DOWN TO THE SEA IN BOOKSA FATHER AND DAUGHTER NAVIGATE NAUTICAL VOLUMES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Children's Books; Casey's novel &quot;Spartina,&quot; about a Rhode Island fisherman whobuilds his own boat, won the National Book Award in 1989.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In judging these titles, I employed Clare as a consultant. Her opinions ofthe writing are, in general, more severe than mine, but her appreciations ofthe illustrations are more enthusiastic. When in doubt, trust the enthusiast.;  Both of us liked Dear Mr. Blueberry by Simon James (McElderry Books, 24 pp.,$12.95). Of all these books, it is perhaps intended for the youngest readers,but we thought it had the tartest flavor.;   It is a correspondence between alittle girl and her teacher. The child writes that she thinks there is a whalein her backyard pond and asks for &quot;some information on whales.&quot; The teacherwrites back with some facts, but his main intention is to stamp out thefantasy. The little girl is unflappable. In this regard &quot;Dear Mr. Blueberry&quot;is a junior version of Roald Dahl's &quot;Mathilda,&quot; a great favorite of Clare'sbecause the child is a rebel with a quicker mind and a sweeter dispositionthan those of the authorities. This is the book that will amuse adults readingaloud to a child, particularly if the adult lets the child decide if therereally is a whale.;   Of The Girl Who Danced With Dolphins, written by FrankDeSaix and illustrated by Debbi Durland DeSaix (Farrar Straus Giroux, 26 pp.,$14.95), Clare wrote, &quot;This book is very good.&quot; I agree. The story is a clear,earnest, beautifully illustrated account of a girl skin-diving over a tropicalreef. There is a shark scare, a dolphin rescue and then a celebratory dreamabout being a dolphin. There are one or two saccharine lines, but where thewords simply say what's going on, they're good.;   The Wretched Stone(Houghton Mifflin, 28 pp., $17.95) is another book we both like, though wedisagree about the drawings. I've admired Chris Van Allsburg's drawings in&quot;The Polar Express&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake,&quot; and found these just as good, a crossbetween N.C. Wyeth and pop art, with an implicit lurking eeriness.;   This wasthe only book in which Clare liked the story better than the pictures. &quot;Storywas great. Weird because some of the people on the boat turned into apes.&quot;&quot;Stone,&quot; told in the form of a ship's log, describes how the crew of the RitaAnne comes under the spell of a huge stone it discovers during a voyage out.It is a simple, short version of the 19th-century tale, a mild and truncatedPoe or Hawthorne, the sort of thing that was grandmother to our sciencefiction of the '50s, Ray Bradbury or Robert Heinlein. The language is plainenough for a bright 7-year-old, but carries some flavor of the sailing shipperiod. It might make a stepping stone to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; or, working in theother direction, the ship's-log device might rope in some very youngTrekkies.;   Two interests, both pedagogical, converge in Sea Squares(Hyperion, 30 pp., $13.95). The book, written by Joy N. Hulme of Monte Serenoand illustrated by Carol Schwartz, is in the style of a super elementaryschoolteacher, a little bit musty but jolly and shrewd.;   The first interestis a natural history of sea creatures. Some are familiar (seals, gulls,whales), some medium-strange (squid, octopuses, starfish -- there are somedetails which you might not know) and some unfamiliar (sea lilies, tub-fish,clown fish).;   The second interest is a number game:;    Three three-stripedclown fish black and white and red;   Nesting in anemones' spiny ocean bed.;  3 clowns with funny faces.;    Have 9 stripes in fishy places.;    And so on,with numbers squared, up to 10 squid with 10 tentacles.;   A very goodappendix lists additional facts. The note on the symbiotic relationship ofclown fish and anemones and the fate of larger fish which try to eat the clownfish is the sort of thing I liked in third grade and still do: &quot;The paralyzedpredators become the dinner instead of the diner.&quot;;   There are some elementsof a puzzle in the illustration borders, which I also liked. This book isprobably best read by grown-up and child together with time for asking eachother questions.;   Dearest Grandmama by Catherine Brighton (Doubleday, 24pp., $13.95) is a book about which Clare and I flatly disagree. Clare: &quot;Iliked the book. It was scary because you were thinking maybe the boy is aghost.&quot; She's quite right -- the boy is some sort of apparition from the MarieCeleste, a ship that was found, drifting and empty, in 1872.;    The action of&quot;Dearest Grandmama&quot; takes place in 1830. A little girl is on board a ship thatis taking her father around the tropics collecting specimens. She writesletters to her grandmother about a boy companion who climbs on board inmid-ocean. He doesn't eat, casts no shadow or reflection, and so forth. Hesays he's from the Marie Celeste, and a letter in his pocket is dated fourdecades into the future.;   I found the development of the story predictableand awkwardly cast in letter form, but Clare may be the critic to go with.;  We disagreed, too, about I Am the Ocean (Arcade, 28 pp., $14.95). Clare wrote,&quot;The illustrations are wonderful, especially the stars and starfish. The poemsare great. Interesting.&quot;;   The illustrations by James Endicott are knockouts.The style for the birds is that of Audubon; for the waves, that of Japaneseprintmakers, with some additional contemporary poster techniques. I'm lesscrazy about the words than is Clare, but I have to admit that a lot of SuzannaMarshak's free verse had simple and interesting truths about the sea -- thehydrologic cycle, steering by the stars, the moon's pull.;   I am the ocean.;  I dance with the moon.;   I never change partners;   and I never miss astep.;   As the tides rise and fall;   The moon and I will waltz forever;   onthe shore.;   I have a problem with the last three lines: Shouldn't the tidesbe, metaphorically, the steps the moon and sea take? As written, the tidesseem to be merely an accompaniment. Chill, Dad. Right -- why spoil a goodtime? And the pictures are stunning.;   What is Winter Whale (Morrow, 30 pp.,$13.95) about? Clare: &quot;Running in the rain, a little boy imagines he's awhale.&quot; Any good? Clare: &quot;OK. A little babyish.&quot; In this case I think&quot;babyish&quot; means that the writing, by San Franciscan Joanne Ryder, condescends,not that the subject or language is simple. Pictures? Well, Clare exclaimedloudly with pleasure at a picture of a whale leaping. &quot;The pictures aregreat.&quot; I thought Michael Rothman's boy in the rain was a Norman Rockwell,Saturday Evening Post concoction. The whale was better.;   I just saw a long,mostly boring TV documentary on humpback whales, but several sections ofundersea filming coupled with the whales' singing were breathtaking. Icouldn't help thinking that the problem with writing about the wonders ofnature is the same problem art critics have: Unless you are inspired, youshould hold your tongue and point.;   In Sea Witches (Dial, 30 pp., $14.95), aScottish woman explains to her granddaughter that she must smash her eggshellsafter eating a boiled egg or witches will use them to put out to sea, wherethey will make trouble for sailors. Lazlo Gal's illustrations of thegrandmother are in a plainer, homelier style than the fantastic paintings ofwitches, storm waves and sailing ships. Joanne Robertson's text, stuffed withfiller adjectives and oppressive alliteration, doesn't rise to their occasion,although I did like the epitaph for sailors: &quot;. . . They sleep on seashellpillows, dreaming of beaches.&quot;;   The way to enjoy Sailboat Lost (Macmillan,30 pp., $15.95) is to paste a piece of paper over the awkward text of rhymedcouplets on an opening page. When Leonard Everett Fisher's 14 double-pageillustrations -- Clare judged them &quot;wonderful&quot; -- are left on their own, theytell an ingenious little tale.;   The Sea Lion by Ken Kesey, illustrated byNeil Waldman (Viking, 48 pp., $14.95). Clare gave up on this one; I enjoyedit, but only because I read fast through the boring parts. Kesey (yes, thejustly admired author of &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; and &quot;Sometimes aGreat Notion&quot;) isn't cut out to write children's books. He waffles around toolong in low gear, perhaps trying to find a voice for kids.;   But he doeseventually get something going that is lively and disquieting. Set on thenorthwest coast of the United States among Indians, &quot;The Sea Lion&quot; plays wellwith potlatch, tribal hierarchy, a fetish made of a walrus tusk, storytellingand story-acting by people who had a different relation than ours to natureand magic.;    The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (TheFeminist Press, 55 pp., $9.95 paperback) was at the bottom of my list. Clarelooked too happy playing in the leaf pile to come inside and read this tract.;   &quot;The Mer-Child&quot; has some natural sweetness but a lot more artificialsweetener. A girl with paralyzed legs meets a mer-boy at the beach. There issome interest in her explaining life on land to him and in his explaining lifein the sea to her, but this potentially good story is overwhelmed by thecharacters becoming dummies for author Robin Morgan's ventriloquial preachingagainst all the ills of the planet. The two characters turn into &quot;seaswallows&quot; at the end, and it is perhaps symptomatic of illustrator JesseSpicer Zerner's minimal and careless relationship to the story that the twobirds are pictured at least twice as ordinary swallows. According to everyusage I've ever heard, sea swallows are terns.;   Not to end on a sour note,let me add one more recommendation. Tarka the Otter by Henry Williamson hasjust been reissued in paperback by Beacon Press (276 pp., $9.95). It is in onesense a children's book, perhaps best for 11-year-olds, but I have recommendedit to graduate students in English for its many literary virtues (clarity,rich English rural vocabulary, exactness of action and setting). It is a bookthat T.E. Lawrence admired.;   It is the story of the life and death of anotter from the otter's point of view. Its origins are perhaps obsessive or atleast eccentric, but, because the author found the perfect language for hisvision, it is very beautiful. I can't wait to read it again.
