In addition to granting a blanket extension -- converting five-year visas to six-year visas for foreign nurses -- INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson said agency district directors &quot;will have discretionary authority to grant additional time on a case-by-case basis.&quot; Guidelines for exercising the discretionary authority are being developed, Mr. Nelson said in a statement.    Meanwhile, he urged hospitals to redouble their efforts to recruit and retain U.S. nurses and Congress to seek a long-term solution to a domestic nursing shortage that administrators say makes it essential for them to employ foreign-born nurses.    About 2,000 foreign nurses, 18% of the total recruited by U.S. hospitals, would have been sent home this year had the INS not extended their visas. Most work in New York or California.    An estimated 300,000 nursing jobs are unfilled nation-wide -- a vacancy rate that ranges from 10% to 20% in various cities. </TEXT></DOC>
