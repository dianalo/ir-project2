York anti-aircraft gun.    The Justice Department's motion dropping the suit, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, came two months after federal prosecutors sought and obtained dismissal of related criminal charges against the company and four current or former executives, including James M. Beggs, former head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    The move was expected in the wake of the embarrassing and much-publicized decision to abandon criminal prosecution. The court at the time set a deadline of yesterday for the government to determine its pursuit of the civil suit.    The civil action didn't seek specific damages.    The criminal case had alleged that St. Louis-based General Dynamics and the individual defendants defrauded the government by charging $7.5 million in costs for the Sgt. York program to other, unrelated government accounts that were earmarked for research and development, and bid and proposal work.    &quot;We are pleased that all aspects of the case have been satisfactorily resolved,&quot; a General Dynamics spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
