This is not achieved simply by findinga place to live in a particular part of town or in a particular facilityfor a minority person.(2) The intent is achieved when a person meeting the ordinary standardsof character and financial responsibility is able to obtain off-base housingin the same manner as any other person anywhere in the area surroundinga military installation, without suffering refusal and humiliation becauseof discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, age, or nationalorigin.(i) The accomplishment of the objective shall not be hampered by requiringthe submission of a formal complaint of discrimination. A suspected discriminatoryact, with or without the filing of a formal complaint, is a valid basisfor investigation and, if discrimination is substantiated, imposition ofrestrictive sanctions.(ii) Upon substantiation that a housing agent practiced discrimination,restrictive sanctions shall be imposed for a minimum of 180 days.(iii) The fact that 42 U.S.C. 1982, Pub. L. 90-284 and Pub. L. 100-430may or may not provide a remedy in a given case of discrimination affectingDoD personnel does not relieve a commander of the responsibility to ensureequal treatment and equal opportunity for such personnel or to impose restrictivesanctions against the agent/facility when appropriate.(iv) Military Installations shall develop information programs to appriseDoD Service members of the DoD policy and program for equal opportunityin off-base housing. Commanders should use local community resources, suchas civil rights organizations, religious and service groups, and localinformation media in support of their programs.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Responsibilities of the service secretaries.</ITAG>Service Secretaries shall:(a) Ensure nondiscrimination in referring DoD personnel to off-base housingfacilities.(b) Continue efforts to identify and solicit nondiscriminatory assurancesfor housing facilities within the commuting area which are considered tobe suitable for occupancy by DoD Service members.(c) Ensure that an office and staff are available to advise DoD Servicemembers regarding:(1) The procedures set forth in this part.(2) The application of 42 U.S.C. 1982, Pub.

Counseling concerning the equal opportunity in off-base housingprogram with particular emphasis placed on the desirability to report anyindication of discrimination against them in their search for housing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Counseling and personal assistance shall include the followingservices:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Offering to check by telephone the availability of selected listings.A record shall be made and retained for future reference of the date, timeand nature of any conversation confirming the availability of a facility.The race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the applicant willnot be divulged. Caution must be exercised to ensure that a pattern of``confirmation only for minorities'' does not develop.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Offering the services of a command representative (such as a unitsponsor or other designated person when available) to accompany and assistthe applicant in the search for housing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Explaining various discriminating methods that may be employedby agents. For instance, if an agent arbitrarily refuses to accept or considerthe applicant as a tenant, falsely indicates the unit sought has been rentedto another applicant, or refuses to make the unit available under the sameterms and conditions as are ordinarily applied to applicants for the facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) In such instances the agent should be queried concerning the reasonswhy the unit is not available. After all reasonable steps have been takento ascertain whether any valid nondiscriminatory reason can be shown forthe agent's rejection of the applicant, and there appears to be no suchreason, a reasonable effort should be made to persuade the agent to makethe unit available to the applicant. </ITAG>(2) The incident shall be reported immediately by the command representativeand the complainant to the HRO for appropriate command action. <ITAG tagnum="71">B. Complaint Procedures_United States </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commanders will ensure that all DoD personnel are informed of thescope and provisions of the DoD Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Programand advised to immediately report to the HRO (when available) any formof discrimination encountered as a tenant or prospective tenant. Incidentsreported to base agencies or representatives other than the HRO (for example,equal opportunity officer, unit commander, supervisor) should be broughtto the immediate attention of the HRO for appropriate action. A verbalor written statement of discriminatory policy by an agent is consideredto be an act or incident of discrimination and the investigative proceduresoutlined in this Appendix shall be followed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Inquiry into Complaint</T3>. Complaints of off-base housing discriminationmust receive prompt attention. An inquiry into the complaint will beginwithin 3 working days after receipt of the complaint. The inquiry may beinformal but must be detailed sufficiently to indicate if discriminateoccurred. Upon receipt of a discrimination complaint, the HRO (or in theevent there is no HRO, a command designated representative) will take thefollowing action: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Immediately notify the commander. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Promptly interview the complainant to determine the details andcircumstances of the alleged discriminatory act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Inform HRO personnel to advise all prospective tenants that a discriminationcomplaint has been received against a particular agent/facility, that substantiateddiscrimination has not been determined, and allow prospective tenants todecide if they desire to view the facility involved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Immediately telephone or visit the facility/agent concerned, ifthe complaint is received shortly after the time of the alleged act andit concerns the change in availability of a vacancy (such as, ``just rented,''etc.). Attempt to determine if a vacancy exists without making referenceto the complaint received. Request the commander to authorize the use ofverifiers as necessary. (See subsection B.2.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Advise the complainant of the provisions and procedures containedin this Instruction and of the right to pursue further actions throughHUD, DOJ, and local or State agencies. Coordinate effort with the JudgeAdvocate's office to determine to what extent legal assistance can be provided.Assist the complainant in completing seven signed, dated, and notarizedcopies of HUD Form 903, Housing Discrimination Complaint. The fact thata complainant might report an act of alleged discriminatory treatment butdecline completing a Form 903 does not relieve the command of responsibilityfor making further inquiry and taking such subsequent actions as may beappropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f. Document the above action for future reference and inform the commanderof the results of the HRO preliminary inquiry and actions taken. The commanderwill take action to assist the complainant in obtaining suitable housing.If, due to discriminatory practices in the community, suitable housingcannot be obtained by the complainant in a reasonable amount of time, thecomplainant and the commander may use this fact to justify a request forpriority in obtaining military housing or for humanitarian reassignment.Reassignment action is a last resort and must be justified fully throughcommand personnel channels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Use of Verfiers</T3>. Verifiers are authorized to determine if a vacancyexists and whether or not rental practices are discriminatory. Verifiersshall not be used for the sole purpose of determining sincerity or normalpractices of an agent about whom the HRO has not received a housing discriminationcomplaint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) When selecting and using verifiers, the following applies: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Verification of the vacancy should be made as soon as possibleafter an alleged act of discrimination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Verifiers should be volunteers (the Equal Opportunity Office isa possible source for identifying individuals to be used as verifiers).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The purpose of the verifier is to isolate the attribute of race,color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap or familial statuswhich is the suspected basis for the complainant's exclusion. Except forthose attributes which are considered to be the source of the discriminationcomplaint, the verifier should possess attributes which are as close aspossible to the complainant. If two verifiers are used, one may possesssimilar attributes to the complainant. Ideally, two verifiers should beused. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Instructions provided to the verifiers by HRO personnel shouldinclude the following: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Explanation of the equal opportunity in off-base housing and off-basehousing referral programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Verifiers are to obtain information only on agent/facility operatingpolicies, practices, and procedures for subsequent determination of complaintvalidity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Verifiers are not to make a verbal or written contract for theapartment, pay any money, or say they want the apartment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Verifiers should be knowledgeable as to family composition, pets,and housing requirements of the complainant so they may ask for identicalhousing requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) The following information should be obtained by the verifier,if possible: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Concerning the Facility.</T3> What is available? Does it meet the requirementsof what the complainant requested? Amount of rent? Deposit required? Arechildren/pets accepted? Is an application required? What is the time betweenfiling an application and permission to move in? Are there minority familiesand/or singles in the facility? Make a note of the presence or absenceof a vacancy sign, and any other information deemed appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Concerning the Prospective Tenants.</T3> If possible, ascertain criteriaand qualifications prospective tenants must meet (credit rating, salary,marital status, children, deposit, written application, and the like),and obtain a complete description of all procedures for becoming a tenant,including all steps from initial inquiry to moving in. Does the manager'ssubjective impression of the application appear to play any part in thedecision to rent an apartment? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) The verifier's statement should be completed immediately afterthe verification visit. It should be accurate, objective, and factual.Include the following: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Date, time of visit, person contacted, position of person contacted.Include any other pertinent information obtained during visit, i.e., lengthof time employed at facility, in addition to the information in subparagraph2.b.(5) above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) When reconstructing conversation, write in the first person andtry to use direct quotes. Do not use pronouns such as ``he,'' ``she,''or ``they.'' Clearly identify who said what to whom. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Sign and date statement. Give full name, address, telephone number(duty or home) and race, etc., as relevant to complaint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Complaint Process</T3>. If the basic facts of the HRO preliminary inquiryappear to substantiate the complaint, the commander will ensure the followingactions begin within 3 working days of receipt of the inquiry report: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Informal Hearing.</T3> Give written notice to the agent explainingthe nature of the complaint and the agent's right to request an informalhearing with the commander. The notification will specifically state thenature of the discrimination complaint and the right of the agent to appearpersonally at the hearing, be represented by an attorney, and to presentevidence and call witnesses. The notification will also state that theagent has 5 days after receipt of the written notice to request a hearing.If no request is received within 5 days, the lack of response will be consideredas a waiver of the right to such haring. The written notification willeither be delivered to the agent personally by a representaqtive of thecommander, or will be sent to the agent by certified mail with return receipt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Composition of an Informal Hearing.</T3> The informal hearing willbe conducted by the commander at a convenient location. The agent, agent'sattorney, the complainant, complainant's attorney, Equal Opportunity Officer,HRO, Judge Advocate, or other designated persons may attend.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Disclosure of Information.</T3> The agent (or agent's attorney) willnot be given copies of the HUD Form 903, or other pertinent statementsthat may later be required for subsequent HUD/DOJ actions. Freedom of Informationand Privacy Act considerations will be determined in accordance with therespective Military Department instructions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Record of Hearing.</T3> A summary of the hearing will be made a partof the complaint file.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Legal Review.</T3> A legal review will be accomplished subsequent tothe inquiry and informal hearing (if applicable) and prior to the commander'sfinal decision that the inquiry supports or fails to support the complaint.The report will be reviewed for content and completeness and a statementthat such a review was conducted, signed by the Judge Advocate performingthe review, will be made a part of the case file. The statement will include:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Any necessary explanatory remarks, including comments concerningthe facts and evidence presented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Information known concerning pending complaints brought by privateparties with respect to the same facility/agent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Comments pertaining to civil rights laws relevant to the particularcase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Commander's Decision. The responsibility for imposition of restrictivesanctions rests with the commander and cannot be delegated. The commander'sdecision will be based on a full and impartial review of all facts andthe policies and requirements as stated in this part. The commander's optionsinclude:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. If the commander determines that more information is required,or for any reason further inquiry is deemed necessary, an officer willbe appointed from sources other than the HRO to conduct a formal inquiryor investigation as the situation warrants. The officer, if not an attorney,will be afforded the advice and assistance of a judge advocate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. If, in the commander's judgment, the inquiry or investigation failsto support the complaint the case will be considered closed and the commanderwill:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Inform the complainant in writing of all actions taken and advisethe complainant of rights to pursue further actions to include:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The right to submit a complaint to HUD and DOJ.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The right to bring a private civil action in a state or federalcourt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The right to obtain whatever legal assistance is appropriate andcan be legally provided in pursuing civil redress.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Direct HRO to terminate action outlined in B.1.c.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Summarize in the report file the practices giving rise to thecomplaint, the actions and results of the inquiry or investigation, anda written assurance from the agent concerning future facility/agent practices.The following statement, completed by the complainant, will also be includedas part of the case file: ``I am (am not) satisfied with the efforts takenby the commander in my behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of myoff-base housing discrimination complaint.'' If the complainant indicatesa lack of satisfaction, the reasons must be included in the case file.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Inform the agent of the results of the inquiry by command correspondenceif an informal hearing was held. Such correspondence should reiterate DoDpolicy and requirements for equal opportunity in off-base housing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Forward unsubstantiated complaint reports and HUD Form 903 toHUD and DOJ if requested by the complainant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Retain a copy of the report file for future reference.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. If the inquiry or investigation supports the complainant's chargeof discrimination and the discriminatory act is determined by the commanderto conflict with DoD policy, the commander shall:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent/facility for aminimum of 180 days. Sanctions will remain in effect until the provisionsof subparagraph 6.a.(1) or 6.a.(2) (below) are met. Restrictive sanctionsshall also be imposed when a suspected discriminatory act, despite theabsence of a formal complaint, is investigated and found valid. The factthat a validated discrimination complaint/incident has been or is scheduledto be forwarded to another agency (HUD, DOJ, etc.) is not cause for withholdingsanction action pending the outcome of that agency's further review orinvestigation. When imposing a restrictive sanction, the commander shall:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Remove the facility listing(s) from the HRO files.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Impose restrictive sanctions (effective the date of notification,as per paragraph (d) below) against all facilities owned or operated bythe agent concerned.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Place the facility on the restrictive sanction list maintainedby the HRO.
