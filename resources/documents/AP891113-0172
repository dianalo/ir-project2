It was expected Florakis, leader of the Left and ProgressCoalition, also would be unable to arrange an alliance that wouldhave a parliamentary majority, extending Greece's politicalstalemate indefinitely.   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis, whose New DemocracyParty won the most parliamentary seats in the Nov. 5 elections butmissed a majority, was the first to try to form a government.   He met with Florakis and former socialist Premier AndreasPapandreou last week but was unable to persuade either to join in ashort-term administration with his conservatives.   President Christos Sartzetakis then issued a three-dayexploratory mandate to Papandreou but the unsuccessful Papandreoureturned without a mandate Monday.   If Florakis cannot form a coalition, Sartzetakis will call theleaders of the three major parties to a meeting to try to form ajoint administration.   If that should fail, the president will call general elections,which would be the third this year.   Florakis has said the Left and Progress Coalition supports abroad-based government. But it has made tough conditions, includingthe removal of U.S. military bases from Greece and the rejection ofa U.S. request for the extradition of a suspected Palestinianterrorist.   New Democracy seeks closer ties with the United States and isopposed to those conditions.   Papandreou has said his socialists and the Left and ProgressCoalition are ``in almost total agreement,'' but Florakis rejectedhis proposal to form a government that would exclude New Democracy.   In the Nov. 5 elections New Democracy won 148 seats in the300-member Parliament. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movementwon 128 seats and Florakis' coalition 21. Two seats went toindependents and one to an enviromentalist movement.   The environmentalists declared Sunday they would not backPapandreou.   A socialist alliance with Left and Progress, with the support ofthe only leftist independent, would control only 150 deputies _ oneshort of a majority.   The third independent represents a Moslem minority in northernGreece and has not been approached by any party.   Elections in June also failed to give any party a majority andthe conservatives and communists formed a short-term alliance,ending eight years of government by Papandreou's socialists.   That unusual alliance was formed mainly to investigate chargesof corruption in connection with a banking scandal againstPapandreou.   Papandreou and five of his ministers were indicted and arescheduled to be tried by special courts next year.</TEXT></DOC>
