But people who fail to look beyond the advertised ratesmay get anything but a bargain. Trying to make up for reducedprofits from their lower card rates, some issuers arechanging the way they calculate finance charges and fees.</LP><TEXT>   The result is that some people who switch to lower-ratecards won't reap the savings they expect. And in some cases,card holders could end up paying more.   &quot;There is no question that more consumers are shoppingaround for better deals than at any other time,&quot; said RobertMcKinley, president of RAM Research Corp., a Frederick, Md.,company that tracks the credit-card industry. &quot;But thequestion is, `What are the traps they have to watch outfor?'&quot;   One &quot;trap&quot; is the so-called two-cycle,average-daily-balance method some card issuers are using tocalculate monthly finance charges. The method, rarely used inthe past but gaining popularity among issuers, isparticularly onerous to card holders who don't pay theirbills in full each month, because finance charges are basedon outstanding balances over two monthly billing periods.   Most card issuers assess finance charges on the basis of aone-month period. The amount outstanding each day is addedup, and the result is divided by the number of days in themonth to get an &quot;average daily balance.&quot; But with thetwo-cycle method, the balance used to calculate financecharges is the sum of the average daily balances for twomonthly cycles -- the current billing period and the onebefore.   As a result, finance charges are increased, possiblywiping out any anticipated savings from a lower interestrate. Consider some calculations by RAM Research for aconsumer with a 19.8% card who spends $1,150 in the firstmonth and $200 in the second month, and pays the minimumamount due of $46. The card holder would pay a monthlyfinance charge of $18.71 under the average daily balancemethod, and $36.84 under the two-cycle method.   &quot;It's a real rip-off,&quot; says Gerri Detweiler, a spokeswomanfor Bankcard Holders of America in Herndon, Va. &quot;The cardissuers are trying to squeeze more income out of their cardholders.&quot;   Among issuers using this method are Advanta Corp.'sColonial National Bank in Horsham, Pa., and Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co., which issues the Discover card.   Both companies say they use the two-cycle method only whena card holder begins carrying an unpaid balance. If thecardholder continues to carry an unpaid balance after thefirst two months, finance charges are calculated on the basisof an average daily balance over each monthly cycle.   &quot;We're simply billing for money that people borrowed fromus,&quot; says Robert Marshall, president of Colonial NationalBank. &quot;We're not price gouging.&quot; He adds that two advantagesof Colonial National's cards are that it charges lowerinterest rates (17.5%, on average, compared with an industryaverage of about 18.8%) and that it doesn't charge any annualfee.   Sears Roebuck says it switched to the two-cycle method inNovember and that, as with Colonial National, Discover cardholders aren't charged extra after the initial two months ofthe billing period.   But some consumer advocates say that's not much help formany cardholders. Will Lund, head of Maine's Bureau ofConsumer Credit Protection, says most people run anoutstanding balance for a couple of months, pay it off, thenlet it run again -- repeating the process three or four timesa year as they deal with bills from Christmas, tax payments,summer vacation and so forth.   Another method banks use that boosts card holders' billsis to include new purchases since the end of the last billingcycle when calculating the balance subject to a financecharge. This approach can be used with either the averagedaily balance method or the two-cycle method. A handful ofstates prohibit issuers from including new purchases.   Two other methods of calculating finance charges are basedon the &quot;adjusted balance&quot; (the amount outstanding at thebeginning of a billing period minus payments and creditsduring the period) and the &quot;previous balance&quot; (the balanceoutstanding at the beginning of the billing period).   Under federal regulations, card issuers must disclose thetype of method used for calculating finance charges. Theissuers, however, don't have to explain how the method works.To find out, consumers need to call their issuer, althoughsome do provide the information on the back of the monthlystatement.   Even card holders who pay their bills in full each monthshould pay attention to the fine print and ask questions.While the usual advice is for such people to find cards thatimpose no annual fee, a small but growing number of no-feecards have eliminated the once standard 25-day grace periodbefore finance charges are assessed. Interest is now assessedimmediately on any purchases with the card.   Banks are also trying various ways to get consumers morein debt and thereby collect more in finance charges. Althoughthey are marketed as a service for customers, many can beonerous for debt-ridden consumers.   Some issuers occasionally promote special deals, such asallowing card holders to make a minimum payment of only $1 ona $1,000 card bill, or skip a payment from time to time. Theoutstanding balance continues to incur interest, however   Paying the minimum or skipping a payment are the worstthings a consumer in debt could do, says Ms. Detweiler. &quot;Forsome people, it could take 20 years to pay it off.&quot;   Consumers should also be especially wary of an increasingnumber of fly-by-night operations that promise to obtain alower interest rate credit card for a fee.   In Austin, Texas, the Better Business Bureau has in recentdays received hundreds of calls-up from just one call sixmonths ago-from consumers who have been bilked of as much as$60 by companies that promise to obtain low-rate creditcards. Instead, the credit card brokers, as they're called,merely provide an application form or a toll-free telephonenumber that consumers can call to get the form.   &quot;They operate for a short time and then move on,&quot; saidJohn Etchieson, head of the Austin Better Business Bureau.&quot;By the time we hear about them, they're gone.&quot;   Several organizations and publications keep track of thecredit-card industry for consumers. RAM Research publishes amonthly newsletter that lists various types of cards andgives helpful hints on what to look out for. The newsletter,CardTrak, is $5 and can be obtained by calling the toll-freenumber 800-344-7714. Bankcard Holders of America(800-553-8025) puts out various consumer informationbrochures on credit cards for $3 each.   Certain states also provide credit card tips. One of thebetter brochures is Maine's &quot;Downeaster's Guide to CreditCards.&quot; Although it primarily deals with Maine's lawsregarding credit cards, it provides a good brief on whatconsumers should look for on credit cards. The brochure($1.50 for out-of-state residents) is available by writing tothe Bureau of Consumer Credit Protection, State House Station35, Augusta, Maine, 04333-0035.</TEXT></DOC>
