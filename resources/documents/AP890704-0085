Facing a strike-plagued summer, Mrs. Thatcher is contemplatingbanning strikes in essential services. And in a show of defiancetoward the railway and subway workers, her government is turningsections of elegant London parks into parking lots on strike days.   Subway, rail and bus workers called a one-day strike forWednesday. Commuters booked hotel rooms and taxis, companies hiredbuses and Harrods postponed the first day of its grand summer saleuntil Thursday.   ``It is absolutely disgraceful that people in the transportunions don't think about their fellow citizens,'' Mrs. Thatcher saidin a TV interview. ``They don't give a damn.''   The 75,000-member railway union, which now paralyzes thestate-owned national network each week, and the 10,500 London subwayworkers, are preparing for a long and costly fight.   Jimmy Knapp, the gruff Glaswegian who leads the National Union ofRailwaymen, says the railmen will keep it up until Christmas, ifnecessary.   And he warns that banning strikes in essential services ``shouldsound alarm bells ringing in every home in this country concernedwith democracy.''   The transportation workers are spearheading a resurgence of unionmilitancy after a decade of defeats, falling membership and lawscurbing the unions' once-sweeping powers to call strikes.   Mrs. Thatcher swept to power in May 1979 on a wave of anti-unionsentiment after a winter of public service strikes left garbagepiled in streets and the dead unburied.   This year strikes have regularly shut passport offices and theBBC. On Tuesday, a one-day strike closed all but emergency localgovernment services.   Rail drivers are expected to ban overtime soon, adding tocommuter misery with hundreds of train cancelations, and a dockstrike also looms.   Most of the strikes began over pay. But there are politicalovertones and both sides seem to sense a watershed is coming.   Arthur Scargill, a Marxist who led his National Union ofMineworkers to defeat in a year-long strike against collieryclosures in 1984-85, hailed the strikes as ``massive resistance toThatcher's policies.''   ``It is time we took a conscious and responsible decision to defyunjust and oppressive laws,'' he told a union rally.   The railway workers want a 10 percent pay increase. Managementwants to impose a 7 percent raise, which is less than inflation.   Inflation has almost doubled in a year, to 8.3 percent, partlybecause wage settlements are averaging 9.3 percent.   Management is under attack for trying to break the strikesthrough the courts, and for seeking to break up the nationalbargaining system by negotiating separately with worker groups.   Ending collective bargaining would weaken union power as aprelude to the government's long-term aim of selling state-ownedBritish Rail to private enterprise.   ``The rail union is a not a militant one but they're incensed bywhat has happened,'' said Murray Hughes, deputy editor of theRailways Gazette, an independent publication.   Railworkers are now among the lowest paid industrial workers withaverage earnings, including overtime, of $457 a week for drivers and$316 for the rest. They want a 10 percent raise.   ``The pressure is coming from workers who see their standards ofliving and conditions under threat at a time of rising inflation,''said Norman Willis, general secretary of the 9 million-membernational labor federation, the Trades Union Congress.   With more than 3 million people using the railway or subway toget to work, strike days are commuter nightmares. People walk, jog,sit trapped in traffic jams or queue up for a handful of privatelyrun buses.   The employers' Confederation of British Industry says 75 percentof commuters are battling in, often hours late, but the costs inlost business and staff time run into millions of dollars.   Legislation banning strikes in essential services is expected toreach Parliament this fall. Mrs. Thatcher's supporters reject theargument that it is undemocratic, saying arrangements barring suchstrikes already exist in France and West Germany.   Graham Mather, director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, aright-wing thinktank, says it should have been done years ago.   ``It would have been easier to change the law when nothing washappening,'' he said in an interview. ``But now it has to be doneagainst the clock.''</TEXT></DOC>
