Gathering in a glittering convention hall incongruously ringed by barbed-wire security fences, the leaders were so upbeat that they barely discussed two issues that are worrying businesses, economists and financial markets in all their countries: inflation fears and interest rate increases. At a separate meeting of the countries' finance ministers, inflation was discussed, but the ministers concluded it was fully under control and not a serious problem, according to participants.    Officials said the West German delegation confirmed that the Bundesbank, the country's central bank, is likely this week to raise short-term interest rates about one quarter of a percentage point. But American officials made it clear that the expected small West German increase wouldn't upset them, as previous German increases have, because recent increases by the Federal Reserve would still mean that American rates were sufficiently above West German levels to keep the dollar from falling.    Reporting on the finance ministers' meeting, Japan's vice minister of finance, Toyoo Gyothen, told reporters yesterday: &quot;There was no sense of urgency that the inflationary situation has reached the level which requires changing of policies or actions to cope with it. That was the general feeling among the ministers this afternoon.&quot;    The leaders quickly confirmed expectations that their meeting would be largely a self-congratulatory one. American officials are trying to use the session, President Reagan's last, as kind of a valedictory for his economic policies. And the other countries, aware that no new policies can be adopted in an American election year, are cooperating.    White House press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Reagan summed up the mood of the opening session by telling the other leaders: &quot;We are on the right track and we have to stay on it.&quot; Last night, the leaders were scheduled to talk about world politics over dinner, in a discussion expected to be dominated by East-West relations in the wake of Mr. Reagan's visit to Moscow.    Mr. Reagan and the leaders of Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada took satisfaction from the surprising growth in their economies nine months after last October's stock market crash, the recent declines in the U.S. trade deficit and the stability of the dollar. They hailed the process of policy coordination they have established, crediting it with helping to limit the damage from the market crash.    In an official statement summarizing the first session, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said: &quot;Our message is and should be one of confidence and optimism in dealing with the challenges confronting us.&quot; While the statement said &quot;there's no room for complacency,&quot; negative notes and disagreements were scarce.    On two issues that pit the U.S. against Europe -- agricultural trade and debt relief for poor African nations -- differences were papered over. And the optimism is likely to receive a further boost today from the announcement in Tokyo that the U.S. and Japan have settled their bitter trade dispute over Japan's beef and citrus import restrictions.    As expected, French President Francois Mitterrand proposed that the countries offer debt relief to the world's poorest debtor nations, largely in sub-Saharan Africa. President Reagan didn't address the issue, Mr. Fitzwater said. But at the finance ministers' meeting, Treasury Secretary James Baker and his counterparts agreed to language permitting each country to address the problem in its own way. Officials said that means the U.S. will stick to its plan to condone debt relief by European nations, without writing off any of its own loans. The Japanese announced a grant of $1 billion to help the poorest countries meet interest payments.    The finance ministers also hammered out proposed communique language strongly differentiating between the poor countries and the wealthier debtors in Latin America, for whom the cautious U.S. debt strategy, stressing market-oriented solutions, was reaffirmed.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa proposed a new Latin debt plan that was said to conform to the U.S. conditions in that it would be voluntary, case-by-case, and wouldn't transfer risks from banks to governments. But details of the plan weren't made public, and it was unclear if it would be endorsed by the summit as a whole.    On agriculture, President Reagan pushed for the U.S. plan to eliminate all farm subsidies world-wide by the year 2000, but European opposition remains strong and Mr. Fitzwater conceded that &quot;we do not expect any sweeping conclusions or admonitions or directions on agriculture to come out of this summit.&quot;    The leaders spent little time on broad macroeconomic questions but agreed to pay more attention to eliminating microeconomic barriers to growth, such as excessive regulation or high tax burdens.    American and British officials said Mr. Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stressed that the 1980s had been a period of economic prosperity because their conservative brand of economics, stressing tax cuts and deregulation, had succeeded.    Security was extremely tight at the Toronto convention center and huge areas nearby were fenced off from the public. Canadian police arrested a suspected Irish Republican Army terrorist who might have been a threat to the summit. And Mr. Fitzwater said President Reagan's motorcade was slowed at one point when police spotted a man carrying a bag marked &quot;ammunition.&quot; But the White spokesman said the bag &quot;contained his lunch . . . so he was not a threat.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
