<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-58-0709 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Health and Environmental Effects Profile for propylene oxide was preparedby the Office of Health and Environmental Assessment, Environmental Criteriaand Assessment Office, Cincinnati, OH for the Office of Solid Waste andEmergency Response to support listings of hazardous constituents of awide range of waste streams under Section 3001 of the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) and to provide health-related limits for emergencyactions under Section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Both published literature andinformation obtained from Agency program office files were evaluatedas they pertained to potential human health, aquatic life, and environmentaleffects of hazardous-waste constituents. Quantitative estimates are presented,provided sufficient data are available. Propylene oxide has been evaluatedas a carcinogen. The human carcinogen potency factor (q1*) for propyleneoxide is .239 (mg/kg/day)-2 for oral exposure. The Reportable Quantity(RQ) value of 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 5000 pounds is used to determine thequantity of a hazardous substance for which notification is requiredin the event of a release as specified by CERCLA based on chronic toxicity.The RQ value for propylene oxide is 1000.</TEXT></DOC>
