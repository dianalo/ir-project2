The      fishing safety pouch comprises a tough, non-abradable fabric having inner      and outer surfaces defining a hollow envelope disposed therebetween. The      fabric is foldable about a midportion thereof for folding and encasing the      inner surface about a lure and hooks of the fishing line. A soft, flexible      mat is disposed within the hollow envelope between the inner and outer      surfaces of the fabric for providing a resilient feel throughout the      entire outer surface of the fabric. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention relates to a pouch for housing the lure and hooks secured to      the end of a fishing line, wherein the lure and hooks are easily stored      while the fishing pole is carried by the fishing enthusiast, and more      particularly to a safety storage pouch for protecting the lure and hooks      attached to the fishing line. The pouch elastically attaches to the      fishing reel of the fishing rod to hold the line taut, while the pouch      folds about the lure and hooks. The pouch will not become disengaged from      the fishing rod, while being easily removable from the lure and hooks      during quick casting due to the elastic attachment to the fishing reel. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,490, issued to Ancona on Dec. 6, 1983, entitled      &quot;Fish Bait Protector,&quot; a foldover pouch for securing the bait about a      fishing rod is illustrated. The pouch features a dichotomous pair of      panels that fold and secure to each other by means of a peripheral Velcro      fastener strip. The object of this invention is to keep the already baited      materials on the rod fresh, free from fouling, and available for immediate      use should the angler desire to cast. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention provides all of the advantages of the aforementioned      fish bait protector, but additionally provides many other advantages not      contemplated in the patent. </PAR><PAR>  In the fishing pouch of the above-mentioned patent, an angler anticipating      a possible quick cast of the bait will unfold the pouch securing the bait,      toss the pouch aside, and cast. In his haste, the pouch may drop to the      floor of the boat or over the side. This is so because the pouch is      securable to the fishing rod only in its folded state; once unfolded, it      is free to become lost or damaged. The pouch, being a light, small item,      is easily misplaced in the enthusiasm of the fishing activity. </PAR><PAR>  Another disadvantage of the aforementioned patented device is the soft,      abrading sponge used to protect the hooks. While the patent contemplates      using sponge to store water to keep the bait fresh, the sponge material is      notoriously abradable. Hooks and other sharp edges of a lure will easily      tear and scar this material. After a short time, the hooks and bait will      cause unsightly rips extending to the outer liner material, thus impairing      the pouch functionality. </PAR><PAR>  Still another drawback of the aforesaid pouch is presented by the Velcro      disposed intermittently along the periphery of the pouch liner. While the      Velcro can provide excellent securement of the bifurcated leaves of the      pouch, an inadequate quantity of Velcro about the peripheral edge causes a      difficulty of secure adhesion, especially when thick, water-laden foam is      used, increasing stress forces on the Velcro elements. </PAR><PAR>  Still a further drawback of the patented device is the possibility for the      fishing line and lure to become tangled or fouled while the pouch is      folded about the fishing rod stem. No means are provided for tautly      securing the fishing line while the hooks and bait are within the folded      pouch. </PAR><PAR>  By contrast, the present invention has improved the aforesaid pouch in a      number of ways that make it more useful, safe, and functionally superior. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a fishing      safety pouch for securing the lure and hooks of a fishing rod in a      protected position, and for simultaneously securing the fishing line in a      taut condition to prevent fouling of the fishing line while the rod is      being carried by the fishing sportsman. The fishing safety pouch comprises      a tough, non-abradable fabric having inner and outer surfaces defining a      hollow envelope disposed therebetween. The tough fabric is strong enough      to prevent penetration by fishing hooks attached to lures disposed in the      pouch. The fabric is foldable about a midportion thereof for folding and      encasing the inner surface about the lure and hooks of the fishing line. A      soft, flexible mat is disposed within the hollow envelope between the      inner and outer surfaces of the fabric for providing a resilient feel      throughout the entire outer surface of the fabric. A plurality of securing      strips disposed about a peripheral edge of the inner surface of the fabric      secures the fabric in a folded position about its midportion. A resilient,      stretchable fastener strip extends from the periphery of the fabric. The      resilient, stretchable fastener strip has a first adhesion strip      attachment disposed on a distal portion thereof. A rigid fastener strip      extends from the periphery of the fabric adjacently juxtaposed to the      resilient, stretchable fastener strip. The rigid fastener strip has a      second adhesion strip attachment disposed on a distal portion that secures      with the first adhesion strip attachment of said resilient, stretchable      fastener strip to form a resilient, stretchable loop. The loop secures the      fabric to a fishing reel of the fishing rod, while the fabric is folded      over the lure and hooks of the fishing line. Thus, the resiliency and      stretchability of the loop causes the fishing line to remain taut and      unfouled while the lure and hooks remain protected by the folded, encasing      fabric. The loop also prevents loss of the pouch when the fabric is      unfolded. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  A complete understanding of the present invention may be obtained by      reference to the accompanying drawings, when considered in conjunction      with the subsequent detailed description, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 illustrates an in situ, perspective view of the pouch device of this      invention, whereby the pouch is shown in its folded state for securing and      protecting the lure and hooks of the fishing line, while keeping the      fishing line taut by virtue of the pouch attachment to the post of the      fishing reel of the fishing rod; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 depicts a plan view of the pouch device of FIG. 1 in its unfolded      state, just prior to its folding about the lure and hooks of the fishing      line; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a partial, perspective view of the formation of the elastic      fastener loop about the post of the fishing reel from the two extension      strips of the pouch shown in FIG. 2; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a sectional view of the pouch device of FIG. 2, taken along lines      A--A. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Generally speaking, the invention features a protective pouch device for      the lure and hooks of a fishing line, while the fishing rod is being      transported by a sportsman or angler. The pouch device comprises a tough,      non-abrading fabric article that folds about the lure and hooks attached      to the fishing line, to protect them until needed for casting. The pouch      has an elastic loop that secures it to the post of a fishing reel while it      is folded over the lure and hooks. In this manner, the pouch keeps the      fishing line taut and prevents fouling. </PAR><PAR>  Now referring to FIG. 1, the pouch device 9 of this invention is shown in      situ, in its folded condition about a lure and hooks (not shown) of a      fishing line 11 of a fishing rod 10. The fishing line 11, in the usual      condition, extends from the fishing reel 12 through the eyelets 13 of the      casting rod 14. While being transported, the fishing line 11 is folded      down past the last eyelet 13 (not shown), and is fed backwardly to the      protective pouch 9. </PAR><PAR>  The pouch 9 folds about and protects the lure and hooks, as will be      explained hereinafter with reference to FIG. 2. After folding, the pouch 9      is elastically secured via an elastic loop 15 to the mounting post 16 of      the fishing reel 12, as will be explained hereinafter with reference to      FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  The elastic loop 15 is also useful as a means to secure the pouch device 9      about a belt buckle or trouser belt loop. Used in this manner, the pouch 9      can be used to carry the lure and hooks when they are not attached to the      fishing line 11. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 2, the pouch 9 is illustrated in its unfolded state, with      the inner surface B facing the observer. A fishing lure 17, having two      hooks 18 dangling therefrom, is attached via ring 20 to the end of the      fishing line 11. The lure 17 is drawn downwardly from the last eyelet (not      shown) on the end of the casting rod 14 of FIG. 1 to the vicinity of the      fishing reel 12. The pouch 9 is then folded over the lure 17 and hooks 18      about a midportion demarcation line A, by bringing peripheral edges C and      D together. </PAR><PAR>  The pouch 9 is secured in the folded position by means of adhesion strips      21a, 22a, 21b and 22b, respectively integrally disposed about peripheral      edges C, D, and E of pouch 9, as shown. </PAR><PAR>  The adhesion strips 21a and 22a are the hooks or male portions of a Velcro      strip, while the adhesion strips 21b and 22b are the loops or female      portions of the Velcro for mating with the male portions. The strips 21a,      22a, 21b and 22b, respectively, circumscribe substantially the entire      peripheral edge, so that the pouch 9 is not prone to separation during use      and movement. Adhesion strips 22a and 22b provide not only a securing      strip, but also a means for applying pressure on the nose or head of the      lure 17 to help prevent the lure 17 from being pulled out of the pouch 9      when tension to the line 11 is present. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to the sectional view of the pouch 9 shown in FIG. 4, the inner      surface B of pouch 9 comprises water-proof marine polyester material, as      is the outer surface F. This material is resistant to puncture or      penetration of fishing hooks 18 (FIG. 2) on lure 17. The inner surface B      and outer surface F are joined together to form an inner envelope 25 that      is filled with a soft, resilient mat 26 comprising a pad of polyester or      foam material. The entire periphery of the pouch 9 is protected by a      wear-resistant strip 30 comprising a tough plastic or leather material to      prevent fraying of the edges of the pouch. </PAR><PAR>  Referring again to FIG. 2, two extension strips 32a and 34 are shown      projecting from peripheral edge G of pouch 9. Strip 32a comprises an      elastic, rubberized fabric, while strip 34 comprises a female adhesion      surface of Velcro loops. Strip 32a has a male adhesion surface 33 of      Velcro hooks that mates and secures with the female Velcro loops 34. When      the mating surfaces 33 and 34 are brought together (arrow 40), as shown in      FIG. 3, the strips 32a and 34 form the elastic loop 15, as shown in FIGS.      1 and 3. </PAR><PAR>  The two strips 32a and 34, respectively, are joined together to form loop      15 as aforementioned, when the pouch 9 has been folded about lure 17 and      hooks 18. The strips 32a and 34 are joined together about the mounting      post 16 of the fishing reel 12 to form loop 15, as shown in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  The elastic loop 15 puts tension on the fishing line 11 when wrapped about      mounting post 16, keeping the fishing line 11 taut and preventing the      fishing line 11 from becoming fouled. </PAR><PAR>  The inner surface B of pouch 9, comprising a non-abrading, water-proof      material such as a marine polyester fabric, ensures that the hooks 18 will      not scratch or mar the pouch 9. The loop 15 makes possible the use of      pouch 9 as a portable bait or hook bag. By forming loop 15 about a belt      buckle or trouser belt loop when the lure 17 is not attached to fishing      line 11, the pouch 9 can be carried upon one's person and can be folded to      secure and carry hooks, lures, bait, etc. </PAR><PAR>  Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating      requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the      art, the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for      purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do      not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this      invention. </PAR><PAR>  Having thus described the current invention, what is desired to be      protected by Letters Patent is presented by the subsequently appended      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
