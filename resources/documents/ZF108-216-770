 The resulting video is hardly discernable from an original,high-quality professional format videotape.andP;  (In fairness, we feel compelledto note that we did not see a live demo of this feature, because the &quot;glue&quot;chips for video speeds are not completed.)andM;Less sexy, but more important in the next couple of years, the C-Cube CL550also compresses and decompresses 24-bit color (&quot;true color&quot;) images so thatthey can be managed as easily as monochrome images.andP;  The compression level isprogrammable by the user and goes as high as 200-to-1.andM;Image compression is one of the critical technologies that must be developedfor multimedia computing to achieve its full potential to expand thecomputer's role as a communications device.andM;The importance of the C-Cube announcement is multiplied by the fact that itschip conforms to an international standard that's just been agreed upon.andP;  Itsfirst products are focused on the Apple Macintosh, which the company chosedue to the Macintosh's domination in graphics arts.andM;C-Cube is the first company to demonstrate a compression device that conformswith the digital image compression standard developed by the JointPhotographic Experts Group (JPEG) of the international standards bodies CCITTand ISO.andP;  C-Cube's technology played a significant role in determining theJPEG standard.andM;C-Cube also is a member of the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) ofCCITT/ISO, which is developing standards for digital compression of audio andvideo for storage on CD-ROM and transmission over low-speed (1.5megabit/second) telecommunications lines.andP;  The chairman of MPEG's videocommittee, Didier LeGall, recently joined C-Cube as director of research.andM;ManagementandM;C-Cube's management is as impressive as its technology.andM;* Edmund Sun (president), founder of Weitek Corp., a leading developer ofhigh-performance math coprocessors.andM;* Alexandre Balkanski (vice president of products), co-founder of DiamondDevices Inc., which develops algorithms and VLSI chips for digital signalprocessing.andM;* Alain Rossmann (vice president of sales, marketing and operations), aco-founder of Radius, the leading Macintosh monitor supplier, previously thethird-party developer group manager at Apple.andM;* Jim Rafferty (vice president of software development), co-founder andchairman of Cricket Software, which developed leading Macintosh graphicsapplications.andM;* Didier LeGall (director of research), was district manager of the VisualCommunications group at Bell Communications Research (Bellcore).andM;C-Cube is a company to watch.andM;ApplicationsandM;The potential applications for high-speed image compression and decompressionare tremendous.andP;  In its broad impact, the technologies will help bypassbottlenecks in storage and telecommunications.andP;  High-resolution, &quot;true color&quot;images, which have 24-bit color depth, are extremely large -- up to 30megabytes (the size of the average entire hard disk) and difficult to workwith.andP;  C-Cube's chip can compress these images to a few hundred kilobytes,which is much more manageable.andM;The bottleneck is more than just storage of huge images.andP;  Transmitting them,within the computer itself or across networks, and working with them inmemory are severe obstacles.andM;There are three kinds of data transmission bottlenecks:andM;* Within the computer system, between disk drives and memory.andM;* Among computers, via networks or phone lines.andM;* Between computers and peripherals such as color scanners and printers.andM;These various kinds of image communications will only happen if the JPEGstandard is adopted.andP;  But what about those who don't run out and buyJPEG-compatible compression and decompression hardware?andM;They won't be left out in the cold, thanks to C-Cube's development ofsoftware that also uses the JPEG standards.andP;  The company is making aMacintosh version of the software, called the C-Cube Compression Workshop forthe Macintosh, available for $500 to developers, who can also resell it for$1 per copy after paying a $15,000 licensing fee.andP;  It includes proposedextensions to TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), the standard format forcomputer raster images.andP;  The proposed new format includes creation of alow-resolution &quot;child&quot; version of the image, which can be viewed easily.andM;Naturally, the software, which uses the computer's microprocessor, is muchslower than the hardware.andP;  C-Cube's idea is that its chip will be positionedsimilarly to a math coprocessor.andP;  It's an option that speeds up certainoperations, but you can still do those operations without it.andP;  The metaphorbreaks down when you're trying to compress or decompress video.andP;  The softwaresolution won't come anywhere close to doing it fast enough to compress inreal time or to decompress and display motion video.andM;The outlookandM;In the near term, this kind of compression system will have the greatestimpact on high-end color image management and video editing.andP;  But there'stremendous potential in low-end applications.andM;For example, second-generation still video cameras will have JPEG-compatiblecompression circuits, allowing them to store more images, with very highquality.andP;  Those images will be directly transferable to a computer forstorage and manipulation.andP;  &quot;Video printers,&quot; as the under-$1,000 one fromHitachi, sold by Sears, will provide a quick way to get prints from thecameras.andP;  Retail photo labs are beginning to test walk-in video printingservices.andM;The video quality of the C-Cube chip is more than sufficient for consumer,educational and corporate applications, which for the first time brings theease of use of random-access video editing into a low enough price range forhigh-end consumers and a variety of business and education applications.andM;The video-speed version of the C-Cube chip is $155 in volume.andP;  The chip willhave to be built onto a circuit board with the &quot;glue&quot; to connect it to thecomputer, increasing the end-user price.andP;  However, if it's built onto a videoboard -- a natural application -- the cost of building the video board isn'tlikely to increase by much more than the cost of the chip, which mightincrease the retail price by as much as $500.andM;Chips can be used in parallel, too.andP;  Four chips together can compress anddecompress HDTV-type video, the company says.andM;If the chip is not on the board the video card, then the decompressed videowill have to be sent across the computer's bus.andP;  In the case of theMacintosh, C-Cube officials say they're not sure if the bus is fast enough tosupport full-screen, full-motion video.andP;  However, they're certain it cansupport quarter-screen images.andM;Apple and IBM both appear to be giving serious consideration to developmentof a multimedia bus, independent of their computers' data bus.andM;We don't have much trouble foreseeing a random-access video editing system asa $1,500 enhancement (plus the cost of hard disk drives, which will varyaccording to need) to an ordinary personal computer in 1991.andP;  That pricebrings it within the reach of a wide variety of potential users, and thesimplicity of editing only within the computer should open the door further.andM;There are two big problems that waste time and increase the complexity ofediting video on tape.andP;  The first is physical -- rewinding, fast-forwarding,and &quot;pre-roll&quot; (the time it takes recorders to synchronize before an edit)use up a great deal of time, compared to the end result.andP;  Frequently, waitingfor a tape to wind uses four to six times as long as the edit itself, even inthe hands of an experienced operator.andP;  As scene lengths drop -- one of theimportant trends in broadcast video -- the ratio goes even higher.andM;The second problem is the operator's.andP;  Remembering how a scene looks is noteasy, finding it on a tape, and being able to visualize how an edit will lookare difficult skills for many people.andP;  Random access saves tremendous amountsof searching and experimentation time.andP;  Using tape, trial and error costshours and hours.andP;  With random access, it only costs seconds.andM;Disk-based random-access editing systems already exist -- Avid makes one forthe Macintosh and Editing Machines Corp. has one based on a DOS system.andP;  Buteach operates at low resolution that's not suitable for the final product.andO;They're only used to make the edit decisions.andP;  The final production is donewith -- you guessed it -- tape machines.andM;With these systems, a substantial investment in computer-controllablevideotape machines is needed.andP;  However, with high-resolution videocompression, once you get the video into the computer, you produce the finalresult right there.andP;  The only tape controls needed to output the resultingvideo are &quot;record&quot; and &quot;stop.&quot;andM;There's another big cost saver.andP;  Once the images are digitized, digitaleffects can be added without specialized equipment.andP;  With software alone,graphics can be added, images can be rotated, distorted, cropped, and soforth.andP;  The effects usually won't happen in real time, but that's not a bigdeal, considering that the personal computer is then replacing video boxesthat cost many thousands of dollars.andM;Eliminating the time and trouble of editing on videotape will be one of themost significant steps ever taken in audiovisual production.andM;If this is so great, you might imagine that professional video producers willjump on it.andP;  Well, probably not, except for the more open-minded ones.andM;The compression done by the C-Cube chip, or anyone using JPEG compression, isnot loss-less.andP;  A small amount of sharpness is lost, and there may be slightdistortion of colors and edges.andP;  Professional broadcasters tend to beextremely intolerant of anything that changes even a single pixel.andP;  Adoptionis likely to be slow in the broadcast realm.andM;However, from corporate video down, we expect rapid acceptance of personalcomputer-based video, especially given the current fears of economicrecession, which lead corporations to restrict large capital expenses.andO;Audiovisual systems are traditionally hit very hard by fears of recession.andM;CD-ROM video?andM;The chip just announced by C-Cube doesn't directly compete with CD-basedvideo systems, such as Intel's DVI and Sony/Philips CD-I.andM;The level of compression offered by C-Cube isn't high enough to play backvideo from a CD-ROM disc.andP;  The data stream, at 1.8 megabytes per second, isabout 10 times faster than a CD-ROM drive's 1.5 megabit per second bandwidth-- and you'd want to include audio and control codes, too.andM;Displaying motion video from CD-ROM is the focus of the standards developmenteffort by MPEG.andP;  Intel, Sony and Philips are participants in the MPEG processand have expressed a commitment to supporting it in future products, when thestandard is developed.andM;If C-Cube's strategy pays off, computer manufacturers will put its chips --and probably other JPEG-compatible chips -- directly on the computer'smotherboard, and support it at the system software level.andP;  In addition to themany external communication benefits, that would eliminate the need for harddisk buffers, temporary files and other schemes for computers to manage colorimages that are much bigger than their memories.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
