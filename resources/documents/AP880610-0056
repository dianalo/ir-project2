Gov. Paul Leonard likes his chances ofgetting undivided attention when he speaks to a high schoolgraduating class tonight.   The senior class at the school, in the town of Put-In-Bay onSouth Bass Island in Lake Erie, consists of one student:18-year-old Jay Faris, the son of school Superintendent Kelly Faris.   Young Faris had some say in the choice of a speaker, andrequested someone who is ``a political personality and well-known.''   Leonard quipped Thursday that as lieutenant governor, atraditionally obscure post, ``at least I meet one of his twocriteria. I am honored.''   The school, which has 80 students, also serves Middle and NorthBass Islands, and some of the students come to class by boat andairplane.   The commencement is traditionally held at Perry's Victory andInternational Peace Memorial on South Bass Island, five miles fromthe U.S.-Canadian border that divides the lake.   ``Never have I had the opportunity to impart so much wisdom toso few people. But at least this way I may have the undividedattention of my audience,'' the Democratic lieutenant governor said.</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Temperamental movie stars can generallybe placated with flattery, money or special treatment, but whenparts of their bodies fall off, there isn't much a director can do.   That's the lesson learned by the cast and crew of ``Ernest SavesChristmas,'' starring Jim Varney in his familiar role as Ernest P.``Know whut ah mean'' Worrell.   The filmmakers were given an impromptu vacation when a herd ofreindeer, featured in the movie's climactic scene, suddenly shedtheir antlers en masse.   ``There was nothing you could do about it,'' writer and unitdirector Coke Sams said as the film's final scenes were being shotthis week at Berry Field.   ``You couldn't yell at them. You couldn't offer them more money.They had molted,'' he said.   The deer, provided by Steve Martin's Working Wildlife in LosAngeles, were flown in from California and Oregon up to six weeksago to appear in the Emshell Producers Group Inc. motion picture.   The deer sported lovely antlers right up until the moment theircue was called.   ``We talked about prosthetic antlers,'' Sams said. ``The problemis when the antlers fall off, there are these little bloody stumpsthey're real touchy about.''   Styrofoam antlers were made for silhouette shots, but didn'twork for scenes in which the reindeers were to pull a sleighthrough the sky.   The only alternative was to put the deer out to pasture _ alongwith everybody else _ until the problem solved itself.   ``They grew their little horns back,'' Varney said as theanimals trotted out this week in full regalia at last.   ``It's a stupid business,'' Sams said with a shrug.</TEXT></DOC>
