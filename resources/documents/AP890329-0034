In annual reports to the National People's Congress, China'slegislature, the officials also acknowledged thousands of instanceswhere false confessions were extracted through torture or frameups.   Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, saidChinese courts sentenced 368,790 people last year, 13 percent morethan 1987.   In sharp contrast, courts acquitted just 2,039 defendants.   Ren said 113,533 convicted offenders were sentenced to death orprison terms of five years to life. He said 101 embezzlers andbribe-takers were sentenced to death or life in prison.   China does not give specific figures for executions, althoughthe number is believed to be well over 1,000 a year.   Ren said murder cases in 1988 were up 9.1 percent, robbery cases43.1 percent and cases of serious larceny 63.8 percent. He did notgive a breakdown of the crimes.   ``While public order is generally stable across the country,many problems and unstable factors still remain,'' he said. Hecalled for ``heavy blows'' against those who ``gravely jeopardizepublic order.''   Despite harsh punishments, China has been plagued by a crimewave in recent years resulting from greater social mobility, lessgovernment controls over people's lives and growing incomedisparities as the nation switches to a market-oriented economy.   Liu Fuzhi, the country's chief prosecutor, said his officesarrested 8,777 on charges of corruption and handled 40,000 cases ofinfringement of people's rights by government officials or lawenforcement officers, a rise of 7.8 percent from 1987.   Among these, there were 4,700 cases where police were guilty ofextortion, torture, frameups and unlawful detentions. Liu said 227cases led to disability and death.   Ren also said youths between the ages of 14 and 18 accounted for8.9 percent of convicted offenders in 1988, up 13.8 percent.   He said there were 74,923 convictions for economic offenses suchas profiteering in scarce or price-controlled goods, hoardingscarce commodities and reselling prized imports like autos andstereos for big profits.</TEXT></DOC>
