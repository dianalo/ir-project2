The problems are just between Afghans.We don't need help from foreigners,'' said the jewelry seller, whogave only his first name, Ghulam.   As the merchants spoke, the last Soviet troops rolled home fromAfghanistan, crossing a bridge at the border town of Termez.   Guerrilla leaders have predicted that with the Red Army gone,major Afghan cities held by the Soviet-backed government ofPresident Najib would fall within weeks. A loose coalition ofguerrilla factions has been meeting in Pakistan to coordinate theirplans.   The completion of the Soviet withdrawal was not announced onAfghan national radio or television.   Along the muddy, narrow streets of the city's old bazaar today,merchants wearing thick quilts against the bitter cold seemed moreinterested in bartering for their goods than discussing the Sovietswithdrawal.   The pullout from Kabul was completed Tuesday night when about 80Red Army troops at the city's airport filed two-by-two onto the fourIl-76 military transport planes that would take them home.   A few Afghan soldiers stationed at checkpoints around the airportwatched the Soviets' departure. For the first time in nine years,the Afghan army alone will have to defend the embattled capitalagainst Moslem guerrillas.   As the Soviet pullout neared completion, many foreign embassiesclosed.   The latest to withdraw its diplomats was Poland, which sent itsfour envoys home on Tuesday. Hungary closed its embassy last week.   West Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Britain andAustria closed their missions earlier this month.   Since mid-January, Moscow has been airlifting up to 600 tons offlour, fuel and other supplies into the capital, to help easeshortages that have caused long lines at bakeries and gasolinestations. Refugees fleeing fighting in the rugged countryside haveswelled Kabul's population to 2.2 million.   The Soviets had hoped to bring in 12,000 tons of flour by today,but Red Army soldiers said the goal had not been met, partly due toheavy snows that closed the airport for several days.   Th Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its troops from Afghanstanunder a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in Geneva in April.   Moscow sent the troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to backthe Marxist government in war with the Moslem insurgents. At theheight of the Soviet involvement, there were an estimated 115,000Red Army troops in Afghanistan.   More than 1 million people, including more than 15,000 Sovietsoldiers, have died in the fighting and about 5 millions of Afghansfled to refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
