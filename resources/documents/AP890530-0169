Claude Denson Pepper, whose politicalodyssey took him from the Senate to the House, spanned 53 years and10 presidents, and made him the unrivaled champion of America'ssenior citizens, died Tuesday. He was 88, and the oldest member ofCongress.   Pepper had been hospitalized since April 6 suffering from anundisclosed stomach ailment, which a spokesman in his office saidTuesday was cancer. He died at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where hereturned a month ago after an interim stay at Johns HopkinsHospital in Baltimore.   Tributes poured in.   President Bush, on his European trip, said in a statement inBonn, West Germany: ``Claude Pepper gave definition and meaning tothe concept of public service. He fought for the poor and theelderly in his own determined way. ... Claude Pepper was agentleman, a noble human being.''   ``He will be greatly missed,'' said Rep. Charles Wilson,D-Texas. ``But we should have the kind of life he had.''   ``There has never been a greater friend and advocate for olderAmericans,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``Claude Pepper wasand will always remain one of our national treasures.''   Just last Thursday, Bush went to the hospital to present thePresidential Medal of Freedom to Pepper, who was only the fourthmember of Congress to receive the award.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said Pepper ``obviously was wrackedwith pain but was able to bring himself together'' and speak for 10minutes. Obviously, there wasn't a dry eye in the place, includingthose of the president.''   Congress on Wednesday is to act on a resolution so that Peppercould lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda on Thursday   The Florida Democrat was elected to the Senate in 1936 as aliberal crusader for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. He promptlymade his mark as an architect of some of the nation's most enduring``safety net'' programs, including Social Security, the minimumwage, and medical assistance for the elderly and for handicappedchildren.   He remained in the Senate for 14 years, then _ after aninterlude practicing law and teaching following a bitterre-election defeat _ began a House career that would include 14terms.   He was still going strong when he barnstormed the nation lastyear in an effort to fend off Reagan budget cuts and elect to theWhite House a fellow liberal, Michael Dukakis, who was all of 3years old when Pepper first came to Congress. He had supportedGephardt until the Missouri congressman dropped out.   Pepper didn't have to campaign to win his most recent term inthe House. No one ran against him after he won with 74 percent ofthe vote in 1986.   Born poor in 1900 in rural Alabama, Pepper was the pre-eminenteyewitness to America's turbulent journey through the 20th century.He was 5 years old, in 1905, when he first saw an automobile. Hewitnessed the passing of Halley's Comet in 1910, and again in 1986.He met Orville Wright, and greeted the Apollo 11 crew on theirreturn to Earth.   He stared Adolf Hitler down in a Nuremberg beer hall, sized upJoseph Stalin at the Kremlin, and earned Winston Churchill'sundying affection for casting the only vote in the Senate for theLend-Lease Act the first time around.   Among several leadership posts over the years, he was mostrecently chairman of the Rules Committee, a position he tookbecause of its influence in deciding what bills would go to thefloor affecting the elderly and poor.   Pepper also gained prominence as chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Aging, an advisory forum that he unabashedly used todraw public attention to the problems of old people. He wasinstrumental in the passage of the Medicare Catastrophic CoverageAct of 1988.   One of Pepper's proudest accomplishments was a law that barsforced retirement. He was the principal author and driving forcebehind the law, passed in 1986, which makes it illegal foremployers of more than 20 workers to require retirement at any ageand orders continued health coverage for older workers.   His own advice to the older set was to ``keep on doing whatyou're doing,'' but maybe at a slower pace.   ``I was playing golf one day,'' he said a few years back, ``whenI noticed my partner's clubs were lighter than mine. I found Icould handle them easier. So I changed to less weighty clubs.   ``So that's what you do in life,'' he said. ``When you come to atime when there's a need for any sort of change, simply lightenyour clubs and go right ahead.''   In recent years, Pepper pushed hard for legislation to providefederal money for long-term home health care, but colleaguesdefeated the ``Pepper bill'' last June, finding a procedural way todo it so as to spare his feelings as much as possible.   In his final years, he dug in his heels against cutting SocialSecurity benefits to elderly retired workers _ half a century aftercampaigning for establishment of the retirement program.   His Senate career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw himbranded as ``Red Pepper'' _ playing on claims during the communistscare of the era that he was soft on the Soviet Union. A fellowDemocrat, George Smathers, took his place.   Pepper was elected to the House from the Miami district in 1962.He was never defeated again, largely because of his doggedattention to retirees in a city heavily populated by them.   His florid, finger-wagging lectures at committee hearingsreflected the politics of the old rural South where he had hisroots. Often he faced news cameras like a TV star as he raked arecalcitrant witness over the coals.   He wore thick, horn-rimmed trifocal glasses and was all but deafwithout his hearing aids, one for each ear. He underwent heartsurgery in 1976 for a valve replacement, and again in 1982, to havea pacemaker implanted.   Pepper, who stood 5-foot-7{ and weighed 180 pounds, had strandsof thin white hair. For a while he wore a toupee but quit in 1980after it blew off during an appearance with then-President Carter.   Early in his political career, Pepper co-sponsored repeal ofpoll taxes _ often used to bar poor blacks from voting _ eventhough Florida at the time was hostile to racial change.   In the late 1930s, he attended a Nuremberg conference andreturned to the United States convinced that Hitler had to bestopped. He pushed for the draft, and massive military assistanceto Great Britain while isolationist fever still gripped the nation.He was hanged in effigy on the Capitol lawn by irate mothers, whocalled him a warmonger. After the war, conservatives accused him ofnot being hawkish enough against the Soviet Union.   He was the first national legislator to push publicly forfederal funding for the war against cancer, a disease that took hiswife, Mildred in 1979, some 43 years after they were married. Theyhad no children.</TEXT></DOC>
