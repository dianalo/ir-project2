<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0290 </DOCNO><TEXT>The vibration IR spectra of a crystal CsBi(MoO/sub 4/)/sub 2/ are studiedunder polarized radiation (E andless; b, E andless; c) in the te mperature region of16 to 300 K and frequency range of 60 to 1000 cm/sup -1/. It is foundthat the structural phase transitions (T/sub c1/=135 K, T/sub c2/=330K) affect the IR reflection spectra of the crystal. The symmetry of low-temperaturephases is obtained by comparing the vibration spectra of CsBi (MoO/sub4/)/sub 2/ with those of crystals CsDy (MoO/sub 4/)/sub 2/ and KDy (MoO/sub4/)/sub 2/. Below T/sub c1/ and T/sub c2/ the low-temperature phase symmetriesare found to be D/sub 2h//sup 8/ and C/sub i//sup 1/.</TEXT></DOC>
