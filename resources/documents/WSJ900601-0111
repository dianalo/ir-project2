Gigot</HL><DATE>06/01/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><CO>   FREST</CO><LP>   The new consensus this summit week is that MikhailGorbachev is a besieged man. The consensus is finallycatching up with Vladimir Bukovsky.   Years ago, the famous former dissident was saying that theseemingly mighty Soviet Union was in fact a ramshackleedifice built on lies and terror. Months ago, he was sayingthat the mighty Mikhail championed in the West was a failureat home. Now he's saying that both Russian and Westerninterests are best served not by more schizophrenic Gorbachev&quot;reform,&quot; but by U.S. support for Soviet democracy. Amid thesummit hoopla, it's worth listening to one of the few who'sbeen right from the start about the Soviet crackup.</LP><TEXT>   The Soviet Union is now in a &quot;runaway revolution,&quot; withMr. Gorbachev as the laggard, says Mr. Bukovsky from hisCambridge, England, home-in-exile. Mr. Gorbachev isyesterday's man, a transitional figure. He will get creditfor creating the process of revolution that he, as a productof the old regime (the Communist Party), was ill-prepared tomaster. Mr. Bukovsky's analogy is the Russia of 1905-17, whenthe czar was promoting reform that became a revolution helost control of.   The failure is evident in the contradictions of theGorbachev reforms -- a &quot;regulated market economy,&quot;&quot;productive socialism.&quot; He understands the necessity ofchange but not the means. His latest economic reform could bethe Red Queen's: pain first (higher prices), incentives later(private property). The man who once presided over Sovietagriculture -- defined as 73 years of bad weather -- is notthe man to preside over Soviet renewal.   The Communists, Mr. Bukovsky goes further, quoting formerHungarian Communist Imre Poszgay, &quot;cannot reform themselves.They cannot liquidate themselves.&quot; They must be swept away,toppled by an alternative force, as they were in EasternEurope. Even if Mr. Gorbachev were to become a radicaldemocrat tomorrow, he could succeed only by dismantling hisown rule. And even if he tried that, says Mr. Bukovsky, &quot;thepeople wouldn't trust him.&quot; He has too much Communist historyin his past.   &quot;What you need now in the Soviet Union is a clean, clearbreak from the past,&quot; he says.   Ah, but what about the threat from Mr. Gorbachev's&quot;right,&quot; from Pamyat, or Russian ultra-nationalists? TheState Department sponsored a visit of these types recently,and they scared the Gorbo-skepticism out of even so savvy anobserver as columnist Charles Krauthammer.   Mr. Bukovsky says, don't fret. The U.S. spent taxpayermoney &quot;to bring in six idiots. . . . They are nothing,nothing] People don't vote for them. They can't even getelected to city councils]&quot; And it's true -- even in theRussian republic nearly every candidate from the lunaticright has been trounced in elections.   George Bush nonetheless says the enemy is &quot;instability,unpredictability,&quot; so Mr. Gorbachev is our man. But Mr.Bukovsky replies that Mr. Gorbachev has become the enemy ofstability. He's the one stirring up ethnic Russian agitationin the Baltics. His Politburo sent in the troops who gassednationalists in Soviet Georgia. His failure to understandfree markets is sending the country into depression. The KGBis stirring up the ultra-nationalists -- the better to letMr. Gorbachev appear as the indispensable centrist.   &quot;The Baltics are peaceful now. But if they fail in gettingindependence, there will be a radicalization,&quot; Mr. Bukovskypredicts. &quot;The non-violent forces would lose credibility.Remember, Lithuanians were still fighting in the forests inthe 1950s.&quot; This argument would be common wisdom if thegovernment in turmoil were in the Philippines or SouthAfrica. But Mr. Gorbachev always gets the benefit of theAmerican doubt.   &quot;The current position of the American administration isuntenable,&quot; he adds. &quot;On the one hand, they say the changesin the Soviet Union are irreversible, so you can sign armsagreements. On the other hand, they say you can't recognizeLithuania because it might lead to a reversal. You can't haveit both ways.&quot;   The West must rethink its strategy. &quot;Is it in the interestof the West to see the disintegration of a huge country,one-sixth of the globe going into protracted civil war andfamine? If it is, then they should support Gorbachev,&quot; hesays. &quot;If it's not, then they must support the democraticforces in the Soviet Union.&quot;   Russia has never had a democracy, but Mr. Bukovsky says:&quot;Look at the results. Everywhere there has been a vote, thedemocratic reformers have won.&quot; Boris Yeltsin (&quot;more sincerethan Gorbachev but still very much tied to his Marxist past&quot;)of the Russian republic is in the headlines this week, butothers will soon become known too -- Moscow Mayor GavriilPopov; the Ukraine's Vyacheslav Chornovil. They offer theonly alternative, he says, to the current spiral ofdisintegration -- strikes, food riots, rebellion. They wouldbe able to do what Mr. Gorbachev so far won't: Defuse revoltin the republics by dismantling the empire.   In his memoir of prison life (12 years in all), Mr.Bukovsky wrote that to keep sane he built a castle in hismind. His suffering then may provide his advantage overWestern Sovietologists now: He remembers how much people havesuffered. His next book, due out this month in France, isentitled, &quot;U.S.S.R.: From Utopia to Disaster.&quot; His timingseems about right.</TEXT></DOC>
