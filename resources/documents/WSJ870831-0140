Realizing that the owners wouldn't budge on their wage offer -- which they had unilaterally implemented last month -- and that they would continue to fire striking workers, the union agreed to a settlement that is almost the same as the one it defiantly rejected four days earlier and not much better than the one it turned down to begin the strike, the nation's biggest ever.    The union accepted a 10% increase in vacation pay, improved death benefits amounting to three years' wages, and assurances that the fired workers would be rehired.    After three weeks without pay, it was a disappointing end to the strike for many of the miners, who had worn T-shirts when the walkout began that said &quot;1987: mineworkers take control.&quot; And it is a general setback for the black union movement, which in recent months has been unabashedly proclaiming its ability to take on, and defeat, the nation's employers and the country's system of capitalism, which the unions equate with apartheid.    But instead of feeling defeated, union officials exuded militancy and wasted little time in throwing down the gauntlet for next year's contract negotiations. They said the strike showed the union's ability to mobilize its members and keep them together for several weeks. And if this year's unmet demands aren't achieved next year, they said they will strike again.    Thus, rather than clearing up the ominous clouds that had settled over South Africa's labor relations, the strike settlement seems to have only darkened them further.    &quot;We haven't won all the demands we sought to win. But we haven't been defeated,&quot; union leader Cyril Ramaphosa said last night at a news conference in a dim Johannesburg hotel. &quot;We have won valuable experience. This strike was a dress rehearsal for further action. Nineteen eighty-eight is already set as the year where the union makes gains.&quot;    Across town, in the headquarters of Anglo American Corp., the country's largest mining house, the mine owners -- who had thought the strike against gold and coal mines would collapse after only a few days -- weren't celebrating their apparent victory.    &quot;Both the union and the employers have demonstrated their ability to administer and withstand pain,&quot; said Bobby Godsell, Anglo's industrial-relations director. &quot;None of my colleagues are going to be celebrating victory here today.&quot;    One of the reasons is that the strike has badly tainted the company's carefully cultivated image as the beneficent liberal employer with a social conscience as big as all South Africa. As the strike dragged on, Anglo, fearing huge production losses, began firing striking workers and hiring replacements.    Although the strike was legal under South Africa's labor legislation, another law gives employers the right to fire workers who don't report for work. In the past several days, about 40,000 miners were dismissed and sent home, and it is this tactic that eventually brought the union back to the negotiating table.    &quot;We were protecting the long-term interests of our industry,&quot; said Mr. Godsell. &quot;It's not in our interest to fire workers. On the other hand, there were some overwhelming economic realities.&quot;    The union took a different view. &quot;During the strike the workers have seen that it {Anglo's image} has all been just a facade,&quot; said Mr. Ramaphosa. &quot;We have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a liberal bourgeoisie. They {the companies} are all the same. They use fascist methods to destroy workers' lives.&quot;    The strike involved 340,000 workers, according to the union, and 210,000, according to the mine owners. In either case, it was the largest strike in South African history. The costs were high: Nine miners died and about 500 were injured in clashes at the mines, either between striking and nonstriking miners or between strikers and security police. The union said that more than 400 miners were arrested, while about 40,000 lost their jobs. An independent labor-monitoring group estimated that workers lost five million rand ($2.5 million) in wages a day and the mine owners lost about 15 million rand in production daily. The valuable coal and gold stockpiles that the mine owners had built up before the strike dwindled.    For all of this, the union didn't receive any more in wages than the owners had implemented prior to the beginning of the strike. The union, saying that black miners are paid one-fifth of what white miners earn, initially demanded an across-the-board wage increase of 30%, but later reduced that to 27%. The owners offered wage increases of 15% to 23%, depending on skill level. Both sides said they wouldn't budge on wages, but the union blinked first.    A test of strength in the mining industry has been in the cards since 1983, when the National Union of Mineworkers was formed. In past years, when the union threatened to strike, management was the first to give in. This year, by holding firm on their wage offer, the owners wanted to call the union's bluff. It took three costly weeks, but it worked.    &quot;The high costs are part of the painful transition to a modern nonracial industrial society,&quot; said Mr. Godsell. &quot;To the extent that both sides recognize their inevitable interdependence, this year's experience can be a step towards more constructive ways of settling disputes.&quot;    The union, however, said it will use its experience to push its militancy further. &quot;Through hardships {like the strike} the workers become more militant,&quot; said Mr. Ramaphosa, who was sitting in front of a poster showing two union workers drilling into a rock bearing the names of the major mining houses. The mine owners, he added, must realize they &quot;are dealing with a different breed of worker.&quot;    Since its inception, the miners' union, which claims a membership of about 350,000, has been the most militant and politicized of the various black unions. Earlier this year, it led the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest labor federation, into adopting a political platform that seeks the end of the current apartheid government, a large-scale redistribution of wealth and the nationalization of the mines and other sectors of the country. It has placed itself at the front of the country's black opposition movement, hoping that this will enable it to command a leading role in post-apartheid South Africa.    But for the moment, union officials must contend with the present South Africa and with explaining to their members that 1987 is not the year to take control. </TEXT></DOC>
