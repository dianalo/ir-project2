Using Analog's system, independent software companies willbe able to perform a variety of tasks inside a computer witha single multipurpose signal processor. The Analog signalprocessors, combined with software from independent vendors,will be sold to computer makers who will add them to theirmachines.</LP><TEXT>   The multipurpose devices do in one chip jobs that usuallyrequire separate processors for each task. As a result,software programmers can write programs that take advantageof a signal-processing chip without designing such a chipthemselves. Moreover, because it can perform many functions,the chip is likely to be used in many different computers,Analog officials said.   &quot;This is a really big deal,&quot; said Kenneth Krechmer, ananalyst with Action Consulting Group, Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;It'sa way of bringing it all together,&quot; he said.   Signal processors are semiconductors that transform analoginformation, such as voice, images and sound, into thedigital information that can be understood, stored andmanipulated by computers. Today, special signal-processorchips are crafted by semiconductor companies to makedifferent items such as: high-speed modems, for sending andreceiving information; compression chips for shrinking andreconstituting pictures or sound sent over phone lines;text-to-speech devices that will let the computer readinformation to a phone caller.   Digicom Systems Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., maker ofhigh-speed modems, said it will use the signal processor inits $399 high-speed modems for transmitting data from onecomputer to another. Jason Blazensky, Digicom's director ofmarketing, said, &quot;A digital signal processor, which in thepast has been fixed in silicon, can now be opened up forother developers.&quot;   Mr. Blazensky said the $25 Analog chip set is competitivein price with existing modem chips. &quot;Now the hardware of thehigh-speed modem cost-justifies the expense of multimedia.&quot;Many buyers have been reluctant to equip their computers formultimedia by buying circuit boards for sound, pictures,motion and voice, each of which can cost $200 or more.   Among other companies working with Analog Devices, XingTechnology Inc., Seattle, is developing software that willlet Analog's chips compress and store still photos and video.Lernout andamp; Hauspie Speech Products, based in Brussels, isproviding software for speech processing. For example, acomputer user with the Analog signal processor and theLernout andamp; Hauspie software could use a computer as ananswering machine that could store and forward calls, turntext into voice and recognize some words spoken to it.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,Analog shares were quoted at $9.125, up 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
