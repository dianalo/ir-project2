The company is a local treasure.;    Best play of theseason: &quot;Our Country's Good.&quot; See above.;    Goodbyes of the season: JohnBrown, the general manager of the San Jose Rep, who fled back to thecommercial theater after a short stint of fund-raising here; and EdwardHastings, artistic director of the American Conservatory Theater in SanFrancisco, retired from the job, though he stays at ACT.;    Long run of theseason: San Jose Stage's &quot;Angry Housewives&quot; hit the two-year mark and wasstill selling out. That's a South Bay record.;    Catastrophe of the season:George Coates' visually wild, thematically empty &quot;Architecture of CatastrophicChange.&quot; Coates' theater found a new San Francisco home, and now he needs tonsof money for his elaborate productions.;    Cabaret star of the season: AndreaMarcovicci shone in a disappearing art, at least in this area. Her revue ofsongs of World War II at the Herbst Theater, sung during the sentimentalChristmas season, was special.;    Theater obituary of the season: The ValleyInstitute of Theater Arts (VITA) folded after 14 years. Founded by Carole LynSutton and Bill Peck, its Shakespeare festival had given starts to such futurestars as Annette Bening.;    Theater birth announcement of the year: ThePacific Jewish Theater of Berkeley was reborn, with new administration and alivelier theater schedule. &quot;My Star&quot; by Paul E. Richards was a problematicstart, but new theaters deserve gentle care.;    Best non-professionaltheater: TheatreWorks of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and now Mountain View.;    Bestnon-professional show of the season: &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at TheatreWorks,directed by Robert Kelley. Cheers for cast members Liona Young, ChristineMcHugh, Jack Davis and Simone Cox.;    Best New York musical: The Kander andEbb revue, &quot;And the World Goes 'Round,&quot; off Broadway.;    Best New Yorkmusical, Broadway: &quot;Miss Saigon,&quot; for all its corn, an exciting shownevertheless.;    Best two-person play: A.R. Gurney's &quot;Love Letters&quot; withnumerous casts. My favorite: John Rubinstein and Stockard Channing, nowstarring in &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; in New York.;    Most disappointingbig-cast show of the season: ACT's contemporary (?) version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; withByron Jennings muttering &quot;To be or not to be,&quot; somewhat as an afterthought.;   Best small-cast show of the season: In for a brief visit at the new MountainView Center for the Performing Arts, &quot;Oil City Symphony&quot; was a satiricdelight.;    Most enduring stars of the season: Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra andBob Newhart were here, doing it their way. And Hildegarde was still doing hercabaret act in San Francisco. But I want George Burns back!;    Least enduringnew star: Josh Kornbluth, doing his show on being an office temporary. Maybethat's a better career choice.;    Best San Jose show of the season: The CivicLight Opera's &quot;Me and My Girl.&quot;;    Best musical comedy performer of theseason: Jamie Torcellini in &quot;Me and My Girl.&quot;;    Most disappointing show ofthe season: ACT's &quot;Food and Shelter,&quot; Jane Anderson's confused tribute tohomelessness.;    Glad-They-Were-Here Dept.: Ronnie Gilbert in &quot;Oedipus theKing,&quot; and Richard Thomas, starring in Terrence McNally's &quot;The Lisbon Traviata&quot; (wonderful first act; terrible second); Pete Benson as poet Wilfed Owen inCity Lights' &quot;Not About Heroes&quot;; Robert Morse as &quot;Tru&quot; (Truman Capote); andPeter Ustinov, a witty, genial storyteller.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MURRY FRYMER, Mercury News Theater Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910602  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  707  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 2, 199100154126,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
