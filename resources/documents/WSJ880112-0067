Industry sources said that senior oil officials in Saudi Arabia expect oil prices to fall to $15, perhaps as early as the end of January. That would represent a drop of around $1.50 a barrel from the current $16.50 average of world oil prices -- and $3 a barrel below the official benchmark set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries more than a year ago but now widely ignored.    The Saudis still are considered the leading defender of the benchmark and of OPEC pricing and production discipline. But whatever the level of prices next month, the sources said, the Saudis will push to get their production, currently around 3.8 million barrels a day, back up to their OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day.    &quot;Although their production may dip slightly below four million barrels a day in early January, they will average up to their full quota within weeks,&quot; one source said. &quot;Maintaining steady market share is their top priority,&quot; he said.    The new higher figures for world oil demand disclosed yesterday by the International Energy Agency could postpone the price drop expected by the Saudis. As expected, the IEA sharply revised upward its estimates of world oil demand, by more than a million barrels a day for 1987, while projecting further consumption gains for 1988. Some oil economists and analysts expect such revisions to have a firming effect on oil prices.    But spot and futures prices on world markets generally declined yesterday, largely because of fresh reports of price discounting in OPEC. According to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Kuwait has offered to sell its crude oil to some Japanese companies and at least one potential U.S. client at prices linked to the spot market.    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported that the spot-market component of international oil trade is growing at an inexorable pace, despite OPEC efforts in the last year to return to official-priced term contracts for its oil.    And the Middle East Economic Survey, which often reflects Saudi Arabia's official view, confirmed previous reports in this newspaper that Saudi Arabia is selling oil at market-related prices to the four U.S. oil companies that operate Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco.    Through official channels, Saudi Arabia continued to deny any discounting of its oil, officially priced at $17.52 a barrel for Arabian Light, the chief grade. &quot;We haven't received any information that (Saudi) oil would sell for anything except official prices,&quot; said an Aramco spokesman in Washington.    The Saudis, in fact, have begun to signal strongly to others in OPEC that they won't look lightly on further infractions of official prices or production quotas. &quot;They're not out to break the market,&quot; one source close to developments said, &quot;but if anybody is cheating, all bets are off.&quot;    If all OPEC members stick to the rules, Saudi Arabia would be willing to permit its production to slide even though the others are producing up to their quotas -- but only for a short period. The Saudis have made clear that after one or two months their full OPEC allocation of crude will be moving into the market. In other words, discounts will be given if required to move full volumes.    In recent months, Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, has reiterated on several occasions that the kingdom wouldn't &quot;under any circumstances&quot; resume its former role of single-handedly adjusting production to account for swings in demand for OPEC oil. The Saudis &quot;are convinced that any 'swing' role on their part only encourages further cheating by others,&quot; one industry source said. </TEXT></DOC>
