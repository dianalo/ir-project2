Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On October 9, 1986, the Board of Directors of FCIC approved a resolutionto authorize the introduction of crop insurance programs in the State ofHawaii for marketing by private insurance companies under an FCIC reinsuranceagreement or an Agency Sales and Service Contract. Hawaii is the only state without a crop insurance program and the Board,in authorizing the introduction of crop insurance protection to macadamianut producers in the islands, is responding to a long standing interestin providing Hawaiian producers protection against loss of production fromnatural hazards.On June 30, 1987, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>at 52 FR 24299, prescribing regulations for insuringmacadamia nuts. The provisions contained herein, applicable to macadamiatrees, completes the insurance plan for macadamia producers. Both programswill be available for the 1988 crop year. FCIC is soliciting public comment on this proposed rule for 30 days followingpublication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Written comments received pursuant to this proposedrule will be available for public inspection in the Office of the Manager,Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Room 4090, South Building, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, during regular business hours, Mondaythrough Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 456 </ITAG>Crop insurance; Macadamia trees. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop InsuranceAct, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby proposesto issue a new Part 456 in Chapter IV of Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations,to be known as 7 CFR Part 456_Macadamia Tree Crop Insurance Regulations,proposed to be effective for the 1988 and succeeding crop years, to readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 456_MACADAMIA TREE CROP INSURANCE REGULATIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart_Regulations for the 1988 and Succeeding Crop Years </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.1 Availability of macadamia tree corp insurance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.2 Premium rates, production guarantees, coverage levels, and pricesat which indemnities shall be computed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.3 OMB control numbers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.4 Creditors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.5 Good faith reliance on misrepresentation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.6 Good faith reliance on misrepresentation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">456.7 The application and policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Secs. 506, 516, Pub.

No person may have in force morethan one contract on the same crop for the crop year, whether insured bythe Corporation or insured by a company which is reinsured by the Corporation.If a person has more than one contract under the Act outstanding on thesame crop for the same crop year, all such contracts will be voided forthat crop year but the person will still be liable for the premium on allcontracts unless the person can show to the satisfaction of the Corporationthat the multiple contract insurance was inadvertent and without the faultof the insured. If the multiple contract insurance is shown to be inadvertentand without the fault of the insured, the contract with the earliest applicationwill be vaild and all other contracts on that crop for that crop year willbe cancelled. No liability for indemnity or premium will attach to thecontracts so cancelled. The person must repay all amounts received in violationof this section with interest at the rate contained in the contract fordelinquent premiums.(b) An insured whose contract with the Corporation or with a Company reinsuredby the Corporation under the Act has been terminated because of violationof the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain multi-peril cropinsurance under the Act with the Corporation or with a company reinsuredby the Corporation unless the insured can show that the default in theprior contract was cured prior to the sales closing date of the contractapplied for or unless the insured can show that the termination was improperand should not result in subsequent ineligibility.
