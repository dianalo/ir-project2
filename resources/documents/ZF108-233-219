(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CIM is easier than everandM;Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) is the ultimate systems integration(SI) environment.andP;  It goes beyond simply linking CAD with CAM, mainframeswith PCs or combining Digital Equipment Corp. with Hewlett-Packard Co. and/orIBM Corp. equipment.andP;  CIM involves integrating hardware, software andcommunications from various vendors electronically, informationally,mechanically and managerially.andM;The worldwide CIM market is projected by Dataquest Inc., San Jose, to growfrom $53.8 billion in 1988 to $81.3 billion in 1992.andP;  Dataquest reports thatthe North America CIM market was $17.8 billion in 1987 and is expected togrow to $25.4 billion by 1991.andM;Dataquest predicts the annual growth rate through 1992 by market segment willbe:andM;* Network and data-input, 42.7 percent;andM;* Monitoring and control, 17.2 percent;andM;* Procurement and distribution, 15.8 percent;andM;* Software integration services, 15.4 percent;andM;* Planning systems, 14.8 percent;andM;* Assembly systems, 11.7 percent;andM;* Total automation applications, 10.9 percent.andM;The 1988 U.S.andP;  market for SI services in discrete manufacturing, according toAutomation Research Corp. (ARC), Medfield, Mass., was worth $1.7 billion.andO;ARC projects that this market will grow at an average annual rate of morethan 20 percent through 1993 to reach $4.4 billion in value.andM;Most of these dollars in 1988 were spent by the automotive (25.6 percent),aerospace (22.0 percent) and electronics (20.4 percent) industries; themachinery, fabricated metals and electrical industries collectively spent theremainder.andP;  These percentages are expected to remain about the same through1993.andM;What's driving these numbers?andP;  Most of the action today in CIM is in:andM;* Networking the entire manufacturing enterprise into a single, integratedinformation system--the goal of CIM.andM;* Computer platforms that are faster, feature-rich and lessexpensive--relevant features as the distinctions between minicomputers, PCs,programmable logic controllers (PLCs), workstations and terminalsincreasingly become irrelevant.andM;* Application-focused solutions that go beyond the limits of CAD, CAE and CAMand into integrated application and development tools.andM;* Operator interfaces that are both easy to use and provide a true windowinto the manufacturing environment.andM;* Alliances and joint ventures among vendors of information systems,applications software, manufacturing equipment and SI services, includingdesign, implementation and project management.andM;Stabilizing the Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) standard (IEEE 802.4)to version 3.0--a major announcement at Enterprise Networking Event inBaltimore in June 1988--has attracted both vendors and users alike.andP;  Now theyhave a target to work toward.andM;The differences between MAP 2.0 and MAP 3.0, besides MAP 3.0 being stable,are somewhat esoteric.andP;  MAP 3.0 includes a Presentation Layer, modificationsto the Application Layer, standards for file transfer, access and management(FTAM) and a change from manufacturing message format standard (MMFS) tomanufacturing message specification (MMS)andM;In short, MAP 3.0 is a more competent edition of the protocol--and is fullyin conformance with the International Standards Organization's seven-layerOpen Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.andM;However, the jury is still out on MAP.andP;  According to Anthony Friscia,president of Advanced Manufacturing Research, Cambridge, Mass.: &quot;Ethernet(IEEE 802.3) is 75 percent to 80 percent of the total networking market.andO;After that, TCP/IP is the leader in government installations and aerospaceand in PC networks in general, whether they are IBM PCnet or fromUngermann-Bass Inc., or whomever.andP;  The number of PCs used on the factoryfloor is so big that the market for PC networking connections is getting bigas well.andM;&quot;The demand for token-bus data communications--MAP--is not increasing; it'sconfined mainly to General Motors Corp. [GM], parts of Ford and some others.&quot;andM;At a recently held MAP Users Group meeting in Oshawa, Ont., those othersincluded Deere (a MAP 2.1 network on a shop floor with about 100 numericalcontrol machines and 80 welding stations), Dupont (two MAP MMS projects) andKodak (both MMS-FTAM and DECnet-MAP gateway installations).andM;&quot;MAP itself is going to be superceded by a more general trend toward standardnetworking or OSI,&quot; continues Friscia.andP;  &quot;What OSI does is divorce the MAPstack from the 802.4 token-bus transmission method and make it mediaindependent.andP;  Because most of MAP is OSI anyway, the OSI profile will becomethe standard means of communication in all industries.andP;  Putting thatcommunication software stack on top of Ethernet, MAP, or token ring, is goingto be the user's choice.&quot;andM;At any site, the backbone network could be Ethernet or MAP, depending onexisting systems, current manufacturing needs and plans for future growth.andO;The selection also depends on how facilities and systems are alreadyconnected.andM;For example, Boeing Co., Seattle, last June decided to use DECnet in one ofits facilities already using DECnet.andP;  Boeing also recently selected MAP 3.0for manufacturing cells in both Seattle and Oak Ridge, Tenn.andP;  There, HP 825Sminicomputers are the MAP/cell controllers running CELL PAC from AndersenConsulting, Chicago.andM;At a GM, Oshawa, beta site, an HP MAP controller is linked by a fiber opticMAP network to Allen-Bradley Co. PLCs.andP;  The MAP network keeps openconnections to 100 PLCs and brings data into a UNIX-based HP mini thatmonitors the status of the entire shop floor.andP;  This configuration enables GMto download programs to the PLCs 15 times faster with MMS than with aproprietary network tested in parallel.andM;Vendors are also busyandM;The vendor side has been just as busy.andP;  All three major computer vendors haveannounced at least MAP commitments, and in one case thus far, actual MAPproducts.andP;  In September, HP announced the general worldwide availability ofMAP products.andP;  Around the same time, Concord Communications Inc., Marlboro,Mass., a major supplier of MAP equipment and services, announced arelationship with IBM, which has already stated its commitment to MAP.andM;&quot;Digital has had and still has commitments to migrate Ethernet and DECnet toOSI; that's our ongoing goal,&quot; says Linda Sanders, public relations managerfor Digital.andP;  &quot;We've announced we're working on MAP 3.0 products, and thateffort is moving ahead.andP;  We're due to announce products soon.&quot;andP;  In fact,industry sources say that Digital's MAP 3.0 offerings are in beta site andcould be announced at this year's Autofact Conference in Detroit.andM;Among the PLC vendors shipping MAP 3.0 products are Allen-Bradley, Cleveland;Square D, Milwaukee; and GE Fanuc Automation North America, Charlottesville,Va.andP;  In addition, the MBME372 MAP controller from Motorola Inc., Tempe,Ariz., has been certified by the Corporation for Open Systems (COS), McLean,Va., an independent organization testing the interoperability of productsbased on OSI's protocol stack.andM;&quot;Once you get Allen-Bradley, Digital, GE Fanuc, HP, IBM and a handful ofothers,&quot; says Tony Helies, president of Concord, &quot;you're getting pretty closeto critical mass.&quot;andM;Marketing reality, though, says that each of the computer and controllervendors will most likely push their proprietary industrial networkingproducts first--for instance, Digital's Ethernet, IBM's Token-Ring Network,and Allen-Bradley's Data Highway.andP;  But, if the user insists, they will offersome form of MAP interconnection.andM;The drive for the integration of CIM increases the emphasis on thedistribution of computer power.andP;  &quot;We're seeing more need for computersdistributed throughout manufacturing but linked more tightly,&quot; says Toni LeeRudnicki, CIM product marketing manager at Digital.andP;  &quot;Users are letting theinformation reside where it's used most but are making it more accessibleaccross the enterprise.andP;  A type of client-server model is evolving vs.andP;  atime-sharing model.andM;The client-server model is just a simple extension of the distributed-controlmodel of manufacturing today.andP;  You add a PC, workstation, or maybe a databaseor file server to the network, and it does not matter to the client-servermodel.andP;  What does matter is what each box does.&quot;andM;&quot;For example,&quot; continues Rudnicki, &quot;if you want a database server, you choosethe best possible computer to keep up with the database.andP;  That is, oneoptimized for transaction processing, record-level locking and so on.andP;  Thatcomputer will be different than a print server or a real-time bar code datacollector.&quot;andM;A major characteristic of the client-server model is more powerful butrelatively small computers further down the manufacturing-control hierarchy.andO;Today, hundreds of manufacturing applications operate on the whole range ofmicros, including 8088-based PC compatibles; 16- and 20-MHz 80286-based PC/XTcompatibles; 16-, 20-, or 25-MHz 80386-based PC/AT-compatibles; IBM PS/2micros; 68030-based Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh PCs.andM;In factory applications, these PCs run typically on a motherboard in apassive backplane.andP;  Because such a configuration is easier to &quot;industrialize&quot;and insert into equipment other than an off-the-shelf PC, PC boards can befound plugged into factory equipment ranging from bar code scanners toautomatic guided vehicles (AGVs) to robotic arc welders.andM;The increase in PC response time, coupled with the decrease in PC prices,makes them competitive with traditional hardware platforms.andP;  For example, theAutomotive Products Division of Morton International, Ogden, Utah, chose anIBM PS/2-based solution over a VAX-based solution for controlling itsfive-aisle automated storage/retrieval system (AS/RS).andM;Implemented by the Ann Arbor Computer division of Jervis B. Webb, Ann Arbor,Mich., the control system consists of two PS/2 Model 80 and 20 PS/2 Model 30micros for such activities as database management, driving PLCs, generatingshipping reports, error correcting, order entry and running the AS/RS.andP;  OneModel 30 communicates to an Allen-Bradley PLC5/15 that directs a conveyor;another Model 30 communicates to a Digital Micro PDP 11/53 mini that runs theAGV system; a third Model 30 communicates to the corporate host, an IBM 9375mainframe.andP;  All the PS/2s are connected by an IBM Token-Ring LAN using NovellInc.andP;  Advanced Network 286 software for file-server functions, networkcommunications and network security.andM;Ironically, the IBM alternative was possible because Ann Arbor already had aninventory-management application, PC/AIM+, running on the PC, whichimmediately lowered the system price for the hardware.andM;Workstation's role in doubtandM;Lately, workstations have become the rage; however, their application down onthe factory floor is dubious.andP;  Workstations may find a home wherehigh-resolution performance graphics are required, such as in processsimulation or where engineering and manufacturing meet.andP;  However, on thefactory floor itself, workstations may be an example of where the hardware isfar ahead of the software.andM;In its April newsletter, Dataquest forecast that in the computer andcontroller markets between 1989 and 1993:andM;* Workstationsr and PCs will merge functionally, and vendors representingeach segment will compete in the CIM market:andM;* Microprocessor baords added to PCs will take revenue away from PLCs;andM;* Minicomputers will be replaced by industrial controllers that arespecifically designed for real-time process control applications;andM;* Mainframes will be primarily used for database management, communicationscontrol and high-level planning functions.andM;These trends are already in force.andP;  Last July, Allen-Bradley started shippingits new industrial controller, the Pyramid Integrator.andP;  Jointly developed byAllen-Bradley and Digital, the Pyramid Integrator integrates, throughdualport RAM and shared software, 32-bit, VMS-based MicroVAXinformation-processing capabilities with the Allen-Bradley PLC-5/250controller, which is compatible with Allen-Bradley's entire line of PLCs.andM;Basically, the device integrates an information-management environment withreal-time factory floor control, which covers such control functions as PLCprogram development and documentation, product up-and-down load, cell andprocess control, trend display and statistical analysis.andM;&quot;Don't think of the Pyramid Integrator as a move of micros to PLCs,&quot; explainsAlice Caldwell, strategic alliance manager for Digital, &quot;but rather as acombination and integration of the two in one chassis.andP;  It gives users atightly coupled hardware platform upon which they can run minicomputer-basedapplications.andP;  And it also solves the problem of connecting the MIShost-computer system to real-time factory floor devices.&quot;andM;Digital intends to develop a &quot;portfolio&quot; of similarly integrated productswith other PLC vendors, such as GE Fanuc and Honeywell, both participants,along with Allen-Bradley, in Digital's System Cooperative Marketing Program(SCMP).andM;The Pyramid Integrator is just one example of where computer boxes areconverging.andP;  &quot;The computer industry is evolving to the point where the boxesare becoming unknown or are not the [deciding factor] in what type ofsolution you purchase,&quot; says Rudnicki.andP;  &quot;The hardware will become more andmore invisible; users will be running more application-oriented environments.andO;Users will be more concerned about what they can see from theirwindow-to-the-world, whether that be a PC, workstation or a terminal.&quot;andM;Integration through softwareandM;&quot;A lot of what used to be custom integration products are now becomingprojects easily performed by the user,&quot; explains manufacturing researcherFriscia.andP;  &quot;Even up to a year ago, 80 percent of the customized solution wasin writing the communications software and establishing the connections toyour plant floor.andM;&quot;Now, a lot of computer communications is part of platform services; thecustom integrator need only write the process solution, which is only about50 percent of the job.andP;  Two, maybe three years from now, the process-solutionportion of your application may be less than 30 percent of the job.&quot;andM;Digital, HP and IBM all have these platform services--software-basedintegration tools--for their base systems.andP;  For example, IBM announced itsDistributed Automation Edition (DAE) at Autofact '88 in Chicago.andP;  DAE is aset of communications, management and database programs that provide astandard application program interface to plant-floor devices and othercommunications facilities.andP;  Also, DAE allows users to develop manufacturingor process-control applications on IBM industrial computers, PCs, PS/2s andeventually will on AS/400 minicomputers.andM;&quot;DAE is an extension to the plant floor of Systems Applications Architecture(SAA),&quot; says John E. Klein, general manager of IBM's Manufacturing SystemsProducts Organization in Boca Raton, Fla.andP;  Klein argues: &quot;DAE simplifies thedevelopment of integrated applications in a distributed environment.andP;  Ittakes on the responsibility of worrying about operating systems, databases,communications and device and data independence.andP;  DAE supports Token-Ring, PCNetwork, Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and MAP.andP;  And, through Real-TimeInterface Co-Processor (ARTIC) cards, DAE can capture any data out on theplant floor.&quot;andM;IBM is reportedly going to announce an enhancement to DAE that will enablenontechnical users to essentially write their own applications and establishtheir own connections.andM;Other vendors are providing integrated applications that run above theoperating System level.andP;  For example, Intelligent Documentation (ID) fromCIMLINC Inc., Elk Grove Village, Ill., links user-specified documents on acomputer to networked text and graphics databases.andP;  Formulas entered in thedocument electronically locate the correct database or computer, invoke theproper communication links and retrieve the latest required information,which is automatically inserted into the document at the proper location.andM;Windows to the plant floorandM;ID integrates &quot;islands of information&quot; by acting as a data-collection,database management and forms-generation system.andP;  As a result, ID reduces thetime needed to create documents and disseminate information, allows immediatereaction to changes in data and ensures data consistency throughout theorganization.andM;Operators must have knowledge of the manufacturing process based on accurate,current, detailed information.andP;  Information is best understood when it is ina format the operators are used to seeing in real life, either ashigh-resolution graphics or as more realistic mimic displays.andP;  And operatorsmust have easy control of the process.andP;  In many cases, readily availableinformation is control.andM;An evolving software technology that would encourage integration andvisibility is the multiwindowing user-interface software system.andP;  Windowscreate the illusion of proximity where real proximity does not exist.andO;Multiwindowing duplicates the concurrency found in paper-based systems; thatis, the messy desk.andP;  Multiwindowing operatig on a multitasking processorallows a user to perform more than one activity, such as machine control,data acquisition and statistical process control (SPC) analysis, by viewingentirely different areas of the same maufacturing line.andM;Currently, the X Window specification for user interfaces, developed andmaintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., isprimarily applied to office and engineering applications.andP;  However, it couldfind a suitable home in the distributed computing environment--theclient-server architecture--of CIM.andM;X Window in the factory would give operators access to all the data withinthe CIM network, thereby enabling them to allocate computing tasks to thecontroller or machine device best suited for a particular manufacturing task.andO;It would also release operators from the ratio of one CPU per operator,further increasing operator productivity.andM;Additionally, X Window could drive the replacement of terminals on thefactory floor with full-fledged PC workstations.andP;  Users are already sayingthat they like the low-cost but powerful workstations, the graphical operatorinterface and the potential capabilities.andP;  However, few factory-floorapplications--vs.andP;  supervisory manufacturing applications-demand X Window.andO;Those that do might include resource scheduling and process control(continuous-process industry applications).andP;  However, those applications arestill either in development or in beta site.andM;Both Digital and HP are working with third-party vendors to supply X Windowapplications.andP;  Digital, in its DECwindows product, provides X Window serversoftware for IBM compatibles and Apple Macintosh PCs.andP;  Vendors currentlyporting applications to DECwindows include Control Systems International,Overland Park, Kan., for cell-control software; Crisp Automation Inc.,andO;Dublin, Ohio, for process control; Setpoint Inc., Houston, for supervisoryprocess control.andM;HP, especially after having acquired Apollo Computer Inc., has both the XWindow and NewWave environments.andP;  NewWave, a superset of X Window, offers aconsistent interface that is based on Microsoft Corp.'s Common WindowInterface (CXI) and Object Management Facility (OMF).andP;  These are agents toperform time- or event-triggered events, communications and applicationprogramming interfaces.andM;CIM is just too big for any single supplier to handle.andP;  No company has allthe expertise or products required to address the incredibly diverse range ofproblems presented in implementing CIM for multiple customers, each of whommay have different strategies and manufacturing priorities.andM;Because there's no one place to go for a total, packaged, CIM solution,vendors are linking up to other vendors in rder to supply a larger CIMsolution.andP;  These linkups are called by a variety of names and have varyingdegrees of strategic alliance.andM;For example, Digital's Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and AuthorizedDistributors are equivalent to IBM's Industry Remarketers (IRs) andIndustrial Distributors (IDs).andP;  HP's National and Regional Account Programsfor Value-Added Businesses (VABs) are equivalent to IBM's IndustryApplication Specalists (IAS) relationships; HP System Integrators are morelike IBM's IRs.andM;The number of these alliances has literally exploded in the last twoyears--and that's just for creating and pushing products.andP;  For SI services,virtually everybody says they are a systems integrator, especially thoseselling computer hardware, applications software, machine tools and materialshandling.andP;  Then there are a few hardware- and software-independentmanufacturing SI companies, notably ITP Boston, Cambridge, Mass., AndersenConsulting and the accounting firm of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, New York.andM;Not surprisingly, as many manufacturers implement CIM into their ownfacilities, they find they have created a wealth of in-house expertise thatcan be marketed independently of the products they offer.andM;Lawrence Gould, based in Auburn, N.H., is a freelance writer specializing inadvanced manufacturing technologies and strategies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
