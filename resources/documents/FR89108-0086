The amendedSNM license incorporates, to the extent practicable, operations and monitoringrequirements of 10 CFR Part 61. More stringent waste inspection requirementsat the point of disposal are being imposed. Environmental monitoring requirementshave been upgraded and action levels have been reduced. A site emergencycontingency plan has been required of the licensee.The State of Washington, Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS),has issued a renewed State license for disposal of source and byproductmaterial under the regulatory purview of the Department. The amendmentsto both licenses were closely coordinated such that the NRC and State licensescomplement each other. Conditions of the NRC and State licenses have beenmade as consistent as possible to implement the new requirements and tominimize confusion on the part of waste generators, brokers and shippers.Conditions deemed to be duplicative of the regulatory responsibility ofthe State of Washington that are enforced through its license for sourceand byproduct material disposal have been eliminated from the NRC SNM License.The NRC staff has prepared both a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) and anEnvironmental Assessment (EA) for this renewal. These documents have recentlybeen supplemented to reflect current staff approaches for regulation ofSNM disposal at LLW sites otherwise regulated by Agreement States. Thedocuments, as supplemented, support the conclusion that issuance of therenewed license will have no significant adverse impacts on health, safetyor the natural environment. Accordingly, a Finding of No Significant Impact(FONSI) was issued under separate cover.Copies of the SER, as supplemented, EA, as supplemented, and all otherdocuments relevant to the license renewal are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, Lower Level, Washington,DC and at the Local Public Document Room located at the Richland PublicLibrary, Swift and Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington.The NRC finds that the issuance of the license complies with the requirementsof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the requirements of Title10, Chapter 1, Code of Federal Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 29th day of December, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul H.
