The rise in the Labor Department's producer price index forfinished goods in May was halfway between a 0.4 percent increase inApril and a 0.6 percent jump in March.   But if it continued for 12 months, the annual rate of inflationwould amount to 5.8 percent, nearly triple the 2 percentage pointsit has risen in the past year.   ``There clearly is some inflation in the system, but the fearsof an inflationary boom are overblown,'' said Larry Chimerine,president of the WEFA Group, formerly Wharton Econometrics, aneconomic forecasting consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   Also taking comfort in the May numbers were officials at theWhite House, where spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Inflationremains low and under control.''   Food replaced energy as the primary impetus behind higherwholesale prices last month. At the prices paid by grocery stores,food rose 0.9 percent in May _ the biggest increase since a 1.7percent jump in January.   Egg prices jumped 12.5 percent, mostly offsetting a 16 percentdecline in April. Poultry prices were up 8.2 percent, pork was up5.5 percent and vegetable prices rose 3.3 percent. However,wholesale prices for fruit declined 0.9 percent and rice was down3.2 percent.   Wholesale food prices at the grocery store level are still only0.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago. That trend is notexpected to continue, particularly with near-record dry weather inthe Farm Belt pushing raw commodity prices for food upward 2.4percent in May.   ``We've got a couple more months of bad food prices coming _everybody knows that _ and then everything will calm down,'' saidMichael Evans, who runs a forecasting firm in Washington.   Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University whoruns his own wholesale price survey, said the danger of higher foodprices setting off an inflationary spiral is much less than thefear that they will.   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``inflationary perceptions are beingformed from the performance of a commodity index (the CommodityResearch Bureau Index) that depends heavily on grain prices.''   ``Dry weather has increased fears that crop yields may beharmed,'' Ratajczak said, ``but sufficient surpluses of allproducts except soybeans should reduce the significance on prices.''   Energy prices, which had surged 3.1 percent in April, rose only0.2 percent in May, largely because of a 3.8 percent drop innatural gas prices.   Home heating oil rose a modest 0.7 percent, compared with hikesof 5.2 percent in April and 2.6 percent in March. Gasoline pricesjumped 3.8 percent last month, but were still only 1.5 percenthigher than a year ago.   The government's index for wholesale prices at the finishedgoods level minus energy and food was up 0.3 percent. Analystsconsider this a more reliable indicator of underlying inflationbecause of the month-to-month volatility of food and energy costs.   Over the past year, wholesale prices excluding food and energyhave risen 2.8 percent.   Leading the May increase in those non-food, non-energy itemswere soaps and detergents, up 1.3 percent; women's clothing, up 0.8percent; tires, up 3 percent, and prescription drugs, up 0.7percent.   Car prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in May after declining 1percent in April on manufacturers' rebates to dealers. Higherprices also were recorded for cosmetics, household flatware andhome electronic equipment, all of which had declined in April.   Children's clothing prices dropped 1.3 percent after risingslightly more than half a percent in April. The only other productwhich had a price drop was alcoholic beverages, down 0.4 percent.   The May increase brought the overall wholesale price index forfinished goods to 107.5, meaning that a basket of products costing$100 in 1982 would cost $107.50 last month, up 60 cents from April.   At the intermediate goods level _ items such as flour, fabrics,steel mill products, lumber and fertilizers _ prices in May rose0.6 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in April.   Excluding food, prices for raw commodities such as tobacco leaf,cattle hides, coal and scrap metals rose just 0.3 percent in May,compared with a 1.7 percent jump the previous month.   So far this year, wholesale prices are rising slower thanconsumer prices. For the first five months of 1988, wholesale costsat the most widely cited finished goods level are up 3.4 percent.Consumer prices through April are up 4.5 percent. May figures onconsumer prices are due out June 21.</TEXT></DOC>
