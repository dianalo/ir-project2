Therefore, a deliberate release of GEMs into specificwastewater environment has to take into account the chemical, physicaland biological characteristics of wastewater treatment site, and thespecific interaction of a released microorganism with the site. Thispresentation will demonstrate an approach to the risk assessment of GEMsused for pollution control in wastewater treatment. The same approachcan be used in evaluating naturally occurring or selection modified microorganisms.</TEXT></DOC>
