In the 33 years since leasingwas first authorized in 1953, more than 84 billion dollars in revenueshave been generated, and in that time many changes have occurred in theleasing process. While virtually each of 89 lease sales held between1953 and 1986 had individual characteristics, leasing has settled intoa stable process with certain standardized steps covering a time periodof two or more years for each sale. Federal Outer Continental Shelf leasesexist off all coasts. Of 5068 leases in existence at the end of 1986,83% were in the Gulf of Mexico, 12% were off Alaska, 3% were off thePacific coast, and 2% were off the Atlantic coast. While explorationand leasing activity slowed in 1986 due to declining oil prices, thecontribution that Federal offshore leasing makes to the national energypicture is substantial. About one-eighth of the nation's domestic oilproduction comes from Federal waters as does about one-quarter of itsnatural gas. Because of the long lead times involved from leasing toexploration to production, it is essential that sound leasing policiescontinue. 20 refs., 23 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
