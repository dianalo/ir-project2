(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Edith Eger relied on humor to surviveAuschwitz. Mineko Lewis used physical activity to make it throughU.S. internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. PorterHalyburton helped Fred Cherry survive in a tiny cell of a NorthVietnamese prison.   The four spoke Wednesday at a conference on the trauma sufferedby captives of all kinds. Organizers said they hoped to heightenawareness among academics and care-givers of the lingeringpsychological effects.   Ms. Lewis, 61, who teaches English at the University ofTennessee, told nearly 200 people during a panel discussion shecan't watch documentaries with film footage of elderly Japanesebeing interned on the West Coast during the war.   ``The old people just gave up. Afterward, they didn't know whatto do. They died physically and spiritually,'' said Ms. Lewis, ateen-ager at the time who had never before spoken publicly abouther experience in an internment camp.   Ms. Eger, 61, a San Diego psychotherapist, said she and otherHolocaust survivors weren't equipped to handle freedom.   ``When we were finally liberated the gate was opened and wedidn't know what to do,'' she said. ``We craved freedom, but wedidn't know how to take responsibility for our lives.''   Ms. Eger was 16 when she was sent to Auschwitz. Her recovery wasslow. ``It took me 30 years just to even utter and speak theunspeakable,'' Ms. Eger said.   Ms. Eger recalled how, as a ballet student, she danced forJoseph Mengele, nicknamed the ``Angel of Death,'' and how she jokedwith one of her captors when he regularly drew her blood fortransfusions.   ``I bet him my blood you're never going to win the war,'' saidMs. Eger, a native of Hungary. ``That's where humor came in. Humorwas the best tranquilizer.''   Cherry, 61, and Halyburton were fighter pilots who were shotdown. Halyburton was in the Navy, Cherry the Air Force. Cherry, apoor, rural black from Suffolk, Va., and Halyburton, a middle-classwhite from Davidson, N.C., were thrust together with their captors'hope that their backgrounds would create racial friction.   The strategy backfired and the two quickly became lifelongfriends.   ``I first perceived him as a plant for intelligence-gatheringpurposes,'' Cherry said. ``I thought he was a trained spy. Weplayed cat and mouse for a very short while.''   The night Halyburton was thrown into his cell, Cherry wassuffering a dislocated shoulder and a broken foot, along with thestarvation and depression both suffered.   The North Vietnamese eventually performed surgery on hisshoulder, but he was worse off with infection afterward.   ``I was very ill. I was literally rotting under the cast. Halywas stuck with me,'' said Cherry, now a computer marketingexecutive in Silver Spring, Md. ``He hd to do everything for me. Heoffered me his food, hand-fed me, bathed me.''   Halyburton, now 48 and a professor at the Naval War Academy inNewport, R.I., was far from the racist his captors thought he wouldbe.   ``All they knew was I was a Southerner. It didn't take us longto realize who we were,'' he said of his friend. ``I don't thinkI'd ever been happier to see anybody in my life.''</TEXT></DOC>
