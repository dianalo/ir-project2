Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South African-installedadministrator of Namibia, confirmed the deaths, which were reportedby a South African newspaper Thursday. He said details would beavailable later today.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said about 350guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization hadwithdrawn and about 900 remained in Namibia as of today, a daybefore a deadline for them to leave.   He said about 1,600 guerrillas infiltrated into northern Namibiabeginning April 1, the first day of a cease-fire and a year-long,U.N.-supervised process to make the territory independent. Duringthe next eight days, 263 guerrillas and 27 members of the SouthAfrican-led security forces reportedly were killed in fighting.   Botha's estimate of SWAPO infiltrators was lower than previousSouth African estimates of 1,900. He said 22 had been captured.   Last weekend, South African, Cuban and Angolan officials workedout an arrangement guaranteeing safe passage for guerrillas toAngola if they reported to U.N.-monitored checkpoints. As of thismorning, however, only five guerrillas had reported to thecheckpoints _ the others who withdrew apparently did so on theirown.   A U.N. official, Cedric Thornberry, said Thursday the insurgentsprobably were reluctant to surface because of the ``menacingpresence'' of security forces near the assembly points.   The cease-fire has not been reinstated since last week'sfighting, although South Africa has said its forces would fire atguerrillas only if attacked.   The deadline for the withdrawal is Saturday, but Botha said hisgovernment is prepared to extend it.   Botha also agreed with the United Nations that South Africansoldiers would not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who reportto the checkpoints. Territorial officials said Wednesday that suchinterrogation would take place, and some South African soldierstried to get access to four guerrillas at a checkpoint Thursday butwere rebuffed by Australian and British members of the U.N.moinitoring force.   U.N. investigators have supported South Africa's contention thatthe guerrillas' incursion violated an accord requiring they stay atAngolan bases at least until May 15, when they could enter Namibiaas unarmed refugees.   SWAPO's exiled president, Sam Nujoma, has called on his fightersto withdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints. Anundetermined number have gone back into Angola on their own, andpolice say others are likely to try to remain in Namibia incivilian guise.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. In December,it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange forCuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.   SWAPO has been fighting against South African rule since 1966and is favored to get the most votes in pre-independence electionsscheduled for November. There is uncertainty whether it will getthe two-thirds support needed to have full control over formationof a new government.</TEXT></DOC>
