A spokesman said the investment firm has raised more than $1 billion from institutional investors for the fund, to be named Crossroads Partners -- &quot;for companies at a crossroads.&quot;    The fund, which Lazard hopes will begin operation this fall, will be headed by Lester Pollack, a founder of Odyssey Partners, a successful investment firm. Mr. Pollack joined Lazard more than a year ago. The fund would take friendly, minority interests in companies that are the targets of hostile takeovers. The placement of a large block of stock in friendly hands is a formidable anti-takeover defense, &quot;and it gives management time to put their affairs in order without a gun to its head,&quot; Lazard's spokesman said.    &quot;There's so much money lined up against companies these days, we think there's some to be made in helping them,&quot; the spokesman added.    The idea of raising money to help companies threatened by takeovers isn't new; Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., for example, considered such a plan three years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
