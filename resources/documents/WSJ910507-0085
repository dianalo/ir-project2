Black resignedas publisher of Gannett Co.'s money-losing USA Today tobecome head of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.   The new post for Ms. Black, 47 years old and one of thehighest-ranking women in newspaper publishing, was announcedhere at the opening session of the annual ANPA convention.She will be succeeded as USA Today publisher by Tom Curley,the newspaper's president and the brother of Gannett ChairmanJohn J. Curley.</LP><TEXT>   In Ms. Black, Gannett is losing one of its most visibleand highly regarded newspaper executives. She had struggledfor eight years to bring USA Today, the country's largestgeneral-interest newspaper, to profitability. In 1990, USAToday had a loss of about $5 million.   &quot;She's ready to move onto something new,&quot; said JohnCurley. &quot;She would have liked to put it over the top and keepit there.&quot; He added that USA Today &quot;is poised to make aprofit,&quot; possibly this year.   Mr. Curley said Gannett didn't make a counter offer tokeep Ms. Black. Sources within the ANPA said Ms. Black isn'texpected to be taking a pay cut; the group is expected tomatch her Gannett compensation. At USA Today last year shereceived salary of $400,000, plus a $200,000 bonus, plusstock. Gannett executives said Ms. Black may have moved to anew job in the company even if the ANPA offer hadn't beenmade. Gannett had considered, but decided against, biddingfor News Corp.'s big magazine group, and Ms. Black would havebeen a top candidate to run such a new property, insiderssaid.   As part of the surprise move, Gannett also named CarolynF. Vesper, 38, currently the national sales vice president,to the new post of senior vice president and associatepublisher of the paper.   Ms. Black assumes the titles of president and chiefexecutive officer of the newspaper industry's leading tradeorganization and lobbying group, which represents about 1,400newspapers in the U.S. and Canada. She succeeds Jerry W.Friedheim, who will become an executive with the formerGannett Foundation, which has changed its name to the FreedomForum and operates separately from Gannett.   Many of the ANPA's members have been critical of what theyview as the group's indecisive and low-profile leadership. Astudy by the consulting firm Booz, Allen andamp; Hamilton completedthis spring disclosed that members were critical of theservice they get from the ANPA and complained that itduplicates efforts of other newspaper trade groups.   Ms. Black takes over a trade group that is in the midst ofmerging with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau and is buildingcooperaton with many other independent newspaperorganizations.   At a news conference here, she said she hopes to providethe &quot;highly visible leadership that ANPA needs. I will bevery mobile.&quot; She said the ANPA will focus on helpingnewspapers increase market penetration and &quot;meet thechallenge of new information technologies,&quot; such as plans bythe regional telephone companies to get into electronicpublishing, and encourage &quot;cultural diversity&quot; in theindustry.   But Ms. Black's greatest strength is said to be her tiesto Madison Avenue, given her role as the top salesperson forUSA Today and a former publisher of New York magazine. Majornewspaper groups have tried for years to get nationaladvertisers to use daily papers as heavily as they usetelevision and magazines.   &quot;I don't know about her ties with Capitol Hill, but she'sgot great connections with Madison Avenue. That's where weneed help,&quot; said Jerome S. Tilis, head of sales forKnight-Ridder newspapers. J. Stewart Bryan III, chairman andpresident of Media General Inc., added: &quot;She has knowledge ofthe people who count.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
