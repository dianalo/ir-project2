Nonetheless, Mr. Taylor said in an interview, Anadarkoexpects to report that first-quarter results &quot;will besignificantly below the first quarter a year ago,&quot; because ofthe sharp year-to-year decline in energy prices.</LP><TEXT>   In the 1991 first quarter, Anadarko earned $13 million, or24 cents a share, on revenue of $98.1 million. Full-yearprofit was $32.4 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenue of$212.3 million.   In its most recent annual report, Anadarko said that ifthe price it was receiving for natural gas in Februarycontinued through the quarter, the company might have been&quot;required to take a non-cash charge to earnings related toits oil and gas properties.&quot; Mr. Taylor said the charge couldhave been as much as $100 million.   Such charges are required by the Securities and ExchangeCommission under complex accounting rules intended to ensurethat a company fairly values its energy reserves. Suchcharges are non-cash but they do affect a company's balancesheet.   Already this year, Enserch Corp. of Dallas and itsaffiliate, Enserch Exploration Partners L.P. have takenwrite-downs of $51 million and $50 million respectively.Analysts have forecast that many others will follow.   Anadarko was receiving around $1.05 a thousand cubic feetfor gas it sold into the spot market in February, Mr. Taylorsaid. By early March, those prices had risen by 15 cents to20 cents a thousand cubic feet and stayed up there for gaspriced in mid-March, he said.   Plus, for four days in March, cold weather in some partsof the country allowed Anadarko to sell 100 million cubicfeet a day of gas for $1.59 a thousand cubic feet. &quot;Some ofour Midwest customers were in a bind,&quot; Mr. Taylor said. Intoday's depressed gas market, $1.59 is considered anexcellent spot price; in past years, many producers in winterwould have refused to sell it so cheaply.   &quot;The price improvement since early February has given us afair amount of confidence that our exposure (to a charge) isvery limited at this point,&quot; Mr. Taylor said. &quot;Things do notlook as dire.&quot;   But prices for gas as well as oil are still lower than ayear earlier, so first-quarter results will be weaker, hesaid.   Mr. Taylor said Anadarko has maintained its 1992 capitalspending budget at $150 million, but the company is &quot;goingslow.&quot; He said, &quot;We're not spending as if our cash flow was$150 million.&quot;   Anadarko basically reinvests its cash flow into drillingand production projects. The company used to evaluate itscapital spending plans quarterly. Then it became monthly.&quot;It's literally weekly now,&quot; Mr. Taylor said, because of theprice volatility.   The company still intends to drill some high-risk,high-potential wells this year in Algeria, the South ChinaSea, Nevada and Texas, Mr. Taylor said.</TEXT></DOC>
