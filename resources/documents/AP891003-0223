(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northwest Airlines will be bigger and itsemployees more personable in five years if its new ownersaccomplish their goals.   ``Personal relations of our people with the passengers is what'sgoing to be the biggest difference,'' said Alfred Checchi, who leda $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest's parent company in June andreplaced Steven Rothmeier as chairman last week.   ``If you can move a few (market) share points to your aircraftyou really drive the economics of this business,'' he said.   Checchi and Northwest President Frederic Malek said Monday thatthe timing of Rothmeier's resignation was a mild surprise. But theysaid his departure was not altogether unexpected given that the43-year-old Rothmeier is a relatively young executive who was notaccustomed to reporting to a group of private investors.   ``He made it clear from the very first day he would be assessingthe situation,'' Checchi said. ``A man like Steve undoubtedly has alot of options.''   Rothmeier's three top officers also resigned last week, butMalek and Checchi said they do not expect other executives to leaveNWA Inc. Malek, one of the investors in the NWA buyout, said he hasmet individually with about 30 Northwest executives and discussedpossible pay raises.   ``We believe we have the enthusiastic participation fromeveryone who is left,'' Malek said.   Neither Checchi nor Malek has airline experience and the twoformer Marriott Corp. officers said they are relying heavily on theexperience of senior employees.   In a wide-ranging, 90-minute news conference Monday, the two mensaid:   _Management will consider selling stock to employees andpossibly making Northwest a public company again through a publicstock sale if the money is needed for expansion or other reasons.   _Northwest is within weeks of announcing a purchase of newairplanes. Checchi and Malek did not identify the companies theyare negotiating with or how much money they intend to spend.   _The airline intends to expand its Pacific Rim routes and itsdomestic flight schedule, a move that could require additionalfinancing.   _The airline is evaluating 15 to 20 proposals to develop itsland in Japan, which some analysts have said could fetch up to $500million if sold. Checchi said the proposed deals would ``improvethe property'' and ``liberate'' cash. He said one of the proposalswill be chosen during the first three months of next year.   _James Cronin, hired last week as executive vice president, isexploring the possibility of starting an airplane leasingsubsidiary for Northwest.   Checchi and Malek said their chief concern is to make Northwestthe airline of choice for business and leisure travelers. Northwestdoes not now enjoy that status, they said.   After Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in 1986 for $884million, performance at the nation's fourth-largest carriersuffered. Late arrival and baggage complaints were common asmanagement was slow in bringing former Republic workers up to parin pay with their Northwest counterparts.   ``We are in the fortuante position that the hard work from thatacquisition is virtually complete,'' Checchi said.   Checchi said he will spend most of the next year meeting withNorthwest employees around the globe to boost morale and tap theworkers for ideas. He said he wants to give autonomy to managers at``the lowest levels of the hierarchy'' as part of his philosophy ofdecentralized decision-making.   The two stressed that they do not view themselves as interimmanagers.   ``We are operating executives who have taken a long-term pointof view,'' said Malek, a finalist in December 1987 for the top jobat United Airlines.   Said Checchi: ``This has got to be the most exciting industry inthe world. I mean, it is fun.''   Checchi said he has not decided how to replace $230 million inequity that belongs to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner ordered Northwest to reduce KLM'sinvestment in the buyout by that much to reduce concerns aboutforeign ownership of U.S. airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
