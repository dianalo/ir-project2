(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca,America's highest-paid executive in 1986, earned nearly $18 millionlast year in salary, cash and stock bonuses and options, theautomaker reported Tuesday.   Iacocca's earnings were part of the $85.2 million incompensation that executives of the No. 3 automaker took home lastyear.   Chrysler released the figures the day after it opened earlycontract talks with the United Auto Workers, and union VicePresident Mark Stepp blasted the earnings as ``an incrediblerip-off.''   Stepp, who leads union negotiators in the talks, said in astatement with UAW President Owen Bieber that the executives'earnings ``blatantly contradict the message they try to send UAWmembers in their factories and offices.''   Iacocca's 1987 earnings of $17.9 million included nearly $13.5million from exercising stock purchase options granted earlier inthe decade, when Chrysler was recovering from near ruin and itsstock was worth a fraction of its present value.   Iacocca also received $765,890 in salary, $725,000 in cashbonuses, $249,000 in stock bonuses and a stock grant worth nearly$2.7 million when it was issued Dec. 8.   The figures were contained in Chrysler's proxy statement, mailedTuesday to shareholders.   In 1986, Iacocca took home $20.6 million, including $9.3 millionon exercised stock options. Proxy statements released and compiledlater in the year showed he was the nation's highest-paid executive.   Chrysler's No. 2 executive, Gerald Greenwald, received nearly$6.6 million in 1987, including $560,000 in salary and nearly $5.3million from exercising stock options. Greenwald is chairman ofChrysler Motors Corp., the company's automaking subsidiary.   In all, Chrysler paid out $85.2 million to 2,035 executives in1987: $77.9 million in cash, more than $1 million in stock bonusesand nearly $6.3 million in retirement bonuses, Chrysler spokesmanJohn Guiniven said.   Ford Motor Co. Vice Chairman Harold Poling was the No. 2 earneramong Big Three auto executives, receiving nearly $11 million:$808,697 in salary, $2 million in cash bonuses and $8.1 millionearned exercising stock options.   Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp., topped GM'searners last year with $2.2 million, including $867,000 in salary,an estimated $800,000 in stock bonuses, $513,000 in stock optionsand $56,000 from a savings plan.   Executive earnings at Ford and GM were disclosed last week.   In their statement, Steep and Bieber said the automakerspressure workers to reduce costs to match Japanese auto companies,but then justify ``stratospheric'' compensation for its executives.   The union said top officers in Japanese companies earn about sixto eight times what their factory workers make. American executivesreceive salaries that are 12 to 18 times their workers' pay, theUAW said, and total earnings are hundreds of times what workersreceive when stock and cash bonuses are included.   In 1987, Chrysler earned $1.29 billion, down 7.2 percent from1986. Ford's earnings rose 40 percent last year to anindustry-record $4.6 billion. GM, the nation's largest automaker,earned $3.6 billion in 1987, up 22 percent.   Chrysler workers have no profit-sharing plan but are due toreceive one under their next contract, which will adopt a formulaestablished at GM and Ford last year.   GM paid no profit-sharing for 1987 because it earned too littleon its U.S. auto operations to trigger payments. GM eliminated itsexecutive cash bonus plan in 1987 but gave out $184.6 million inexecutive stock bonuses last year.   Ford paid out a record $636 million in profit-sharing for 1987,averaging $4,000 per worker. Ford also paid out a total of $247.9million in 1987 cash bonuses to 5,166 executives.</TEXT></DOC>
