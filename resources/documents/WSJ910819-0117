The proposals take the trend toward largeregional dumps to mind-boggling extremes.   No. 2 hauler Browning-Ferris Industries wants to turn aformer Kaiser Steel iron ore mine, which is two miles long, ahalf-mile wide and a quarter-mile deep, into the nation'sbiggest dump. The Riverside County site could hold 700million tons of trash, or about 100 years of garbage at theplanned 20,000 tons a day. By contrast, a20-million-ton-capacity dump is considered large.   No. 1 hauler Waste Management's plan, modest bycomparison, would stash 200 million tons in neighboring SanBernardino County. A third company, Western Waste Industries,also is exploring the idea of a trash train to the desert.   The counties haven't signed off yet, but they'reintrigued. Riverside, for example, would get $30 million ormore a year in &quot;host fees&quot; under Browning-Ferris's plan. Asfor the haulers, the megadumps would bring them billions ofdollars in disposal revenues and be hugely profitable.   Why the desert? Los Angeles County faces a severe dumpshortage for its 50,000 tons a day of trash. Several largedumps in the county are either running out of space or havingpermit problems. Recycling will reduce percapita dump needs,but the population is booming.   The tough sell is with some desert dwellers. SanBernardino nature lover Peter Burk opposes the plansentirely: &quot;The old dump-it-in-the-desert mentality.&quot;Riverside opponents say that the iron ore mine is already anenvironmental disaster threatening ground water, and thatcovering it in trash would only make matters worse.Browning-Ferris says its system of liners would protect thewater. State and local permit battles are the next step.                                                                                                          Waste Management   Goes Easy on Itself                                                                                                          COMPILING dossiers on Waste Management's allegedenvironmental misdeeds has been a full-time job in recentyears for some activists at Greenpeace and Citizen'sClearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.   Now, the garbage giant has published an environmentalself-assessment. The 157-page volume is the most completedescription of the company's far-flung trash, hazardous wasteand recycling business yet published. And it's far moredetailed than environmental reports prepared by many othermajor companies.   It's hardly critical, though, and dwells on less crucialsubjects, such as the fuel efficiency of trash trucks, whileoffering scant data on complaints lodged by regulators. Evensome company officials, according to Leah Haygood, a WasteManagement Washington staffer who compiled the first annualreport, complained &quot;it sounds a bit too promotional.&quot;   The company was fined a total of $5.4 million byregulators last year, according to the report. The mistakesranged from dumping portable-toilet waste into a Floridafield, which cost $10,945 in fines, to overstuffing ahazardous waste incinerator in Sauget, Ill., which drew a$250,000 fine.   About 75% of the 1990 fines, or $4.1 million, were at ahazardous waste site in Chicago, where pollution-monitoringequipment was unplugged and the incinerator was overstuffed,which can lead to dangerous emissions. In the report, WasteManagement takes credit for notifying regulators, but failsto give credit to a whistle-blower, later fired, fornotifying the company. &quot;There was a discussion about how farwe should dig into the past,&quot; Ms. Haygood says.                                                                                                          Less Old Motor Oil   Heads Down the Drain                                                                                                          USED motor oil is increasingly being re-refined into newlubricants and fuels instead of being improperly poured downthe drain or burned by industry.   With Safety-Kleen's new $50 million re-refinery in EastChicago, Ind., hitting full stride late this year, thepercentage of the 1.35 billion gallons of motor oil rerefinedcould exceed 10% next year, up from just 2% in 1988.   The new plant will be able to process 75 million gallons ayear. Another Safety-Kleen re-refinery in Breslau, Ontario,handles 35 million gallons a year, and smaller re-refinersare adding to their capacity, too.   Still, as much as one-third of used oil continues to bedisposed of improperly, while more than half is used as fuelin industrial boilers and furnaces, potentially polluting theair.   Safety-Kleen, Elgin, Ill., is hoping the EnvironmentalProtection Agency declares used oil, which containschlorinated compounds and lead, a hazardous waste. Such aclassification would force some used-oil burners out of thebusiness, and drive disposal prices up, making re-refineriesmore profitable.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE EPA is &quot;at least a year behind,&quot; a spokeswoman says,in issuing regulations expected to close about half thenation's garbage dumps and to force those remaining tooperate more safely. Even after the EPA issues the rules,states will have 18 months to implement them. . . . Hazardouswaste dumps are the most objectionable type of waste facilityto the public, industry and regulatory officials say, butalso the most profitable. Union Pacific's hazardous-wastebusiness more than doubled last year, and WestinghouseElectric is considering entering the business.</TEXT></DOC>
