Such companies as Michelin Tire Corp., Mattel Inc. and Union Carbide Corp. are putting a new spin on the age-old practice of factoring -- selling trade receivables, or accounts due from buyers of their products. Typically, factoring has been a financing technique of last resort, used mainly by smaller companies that couldn't raise significant money any other way.    Now, however, manufacturing companies are tapping a new set of buyers. Instead of selling their receivables to another company that takes charge of collecting the cash, they're turning to the capital markets by using the receivables to back new issues of commercial paper and preferred stock. In the process, they've become the newest participants in the booming asset-backed securities markets. And, they say, they're saving a lot of money.    Last month, the first public offerings of preferred stock backed by trade receivables were made, a $62.5 million offering from Mattel and a $249 million issue from Union Carbide. Other transactions, including a Michelin offering, have been made privately. Some $8 billion to $10 billion of commercial paper outstanding is backed by trade receivables, according to an official at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    Union Carbide's complex offering produced a 10-inch stack of legal papers and cost about $1 million more in expenses than a conventional financing, says John A. Clerico, treasurer. But it was worth it, the company says, citing an expected saving of more than $1,250,000 a year in after-tax financing costs in the first three years. &quot;If it remains outstanding over a longer period, we'll have significantly greater savings,&quot; Mr. Clerico adds.    Receivable-backed securities are also considerably cheaper for the issuer than factoring, says Craig J. Goldberg, a vice president at First Boston Corp., which managed the Union Carbide and Mattel offerings. The cost of a factoring transaction can be as much as 2% over the prime rate, or 10.75% at today's rates, he says, while the rate on an average asset-backed securities offering currently runs at about 9.25%.    Although trade receivable-backed financing has been around since at least 1983, when Merrill made its first deal, it has developed more slowly than securities backed by so-called term receivables. Term receivables, such as auto loans and credit card bills, include interest; trade receivables don't. Trade receivables are also a lot more variable in both size and quality than term receivables, making them more difficult to analyze.    In an asset-backed financing, the issuer sells assets to a shell company or trust that issues the securities. If the transaction goes sour, the assets are used to pay investors.    But it's hard to set a value on a pool of trade receivables. The quality and characteristics of the receivables can vary widely, depending not only on the credit of the buyer but also on how the seller handles its billing. What happens, for instance, if Mattel inadvertently sends out a shipment of defective Barbie dolls and buyers refuse to pay for them? One possible solution: the issuer substitutes another receivable.    Another potential problem is the usual discount, normally 2%, for early payment. If the company is overly generous with the discount, the pool will be worth less. &quot;Conventionally, as I understand it, if you're a big enough buyer, you take the 2% and pay whenever you feel like it,&quot; says Russell B. Brewer, a vice president at Financial Security Assurance Inc., which insured the Mattel offering. Mattel doesn't let buyers get away with that, Mr. Brewer says; nonetheless, Financial Security insisted on a provision that puts a lower value on the receivables of chronic late payers.    Because of problems like that, every trade receivable-backed issue so far has involved a 100% guarantee from insurers or from banks. The guarantee lets the offerings get triple-A ratings even if the rating companies aren't entirely comfortable with the pool of receivables.    But that's beginning to change. Underwriters have been pushing the rating companies to let the receivables pools stand, at least to an extent, on their own. Union Bank of Switzerland is working on a structure that would need less than 20% insurance, saving issuers around $180,000, or about half the usual insurance costs on a $100 million offering.    The rating companies are listening. &quot;We would consider rating a pool without a guarantor&quot; as long as the structure included other ways of protecting investors from loss, says Douglas A. Watson, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service Inc. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., too, foresees non-insured offerings. &quot;A receivable is a receivable is a receivable,&quot; says Miles Federman, senior vice president. &quot;I think any type should be fair game.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;With something brand new, with no established track record, we'd be cautious and conservative.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
