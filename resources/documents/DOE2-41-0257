(C-E), under contract to EPRI, is investigatingthe combustion performance characteristics of coals of varying qualitiesin their combustion test facilities. Coals tested to date have includedraw and cleaned coals from EPRI's Coal Quality Development Center (CQDC)in Homer City, Pennsylvania. In this study, bench and pilot-scale testingof an Illinois {number_sign}6 steam coal and a lower sulfur/lower ashIllinois metallurgical coal was done to evaluate the impacts of improvingcoal quality on the performance of a utility unit derated due to slagging/foulingwhen burning the steam coal. 20 refs., 42 figs., 34 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
