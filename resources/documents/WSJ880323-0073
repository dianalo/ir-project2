By a vote of 73-24, eight votes more than needed, the Senate voted yesterday morning to enact the Civil Rights Restoration Act over Mr. Reagan's objections. Later, the House voted to override the veto, 292-133, which was also in excess of the two-thirds margin required. The override was the ninth of the president's 63 vetoes to be reversed by Congress.    Lead Senate sponsor Edward Kennedy (D., Mass) called the vote &quot;a victory for millions of Americans who are disabled or minorities or women who have felt the lash of discrimination over the last four years.&quot;    Presidential candidate Robert Dole (R., Kan.), who was the only senator to miss the vote -- other than two with illnesses -- said through a spokesman that he supported the bill but would have voted against it if his vote was needed to sustain the veto.    The act is intended to reverse the effects of a 1984 Supreme Court decision involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania. That decision drastically narrowed the reach of anti-bias statutes by limiting the sanctions of federal civil-rights laws to specific programs that receive federal aid. The measure that became law yesterday will restore civil-rights protections to entire schools, state and local governments, and private companies that receive federal assistance or provide public services.    Since 1984, Congress had made several attempts to reverse the decision, arguing that the court misread Congress's intentions. But those efforts were stymied by a debate over abortion rights. Lawmakers broke the deadlock earlier this year by attaching amendments to the measure declaring that neither the bill nor regulations to implement it will require hospitals or medical schools that receive federal funds to perform or pay for abortions.    Despite those additions, the president vetoed the bill last Wednesday, saying it would &quot;seriously impinge upon religious liberty&quot; and cover the private sector and local governments too broadly. He favored an alternative bill allowing more exemptions from the law, a version of which was defeated in both houses.    The White House, which had harshly criticized the bill and lobbied hard to uphold President Reagan's veto, struck a conciliatory tone in response to the vote. &quot;We presented an alternative civil rights act, which stated the president's strong views against discrimination in this country,&quot; said a White House statement. &quot;The Congress chose to override the president's veto. We will work to implement the new law.&quot;    Supporters of the measure argued that the Grove City decision has thwarted investigators seeking to investigate bias complaints. In the Department of Education alone, according to congressional staff, more than 670 complaints of bias were closed or narrowed through fiscal 1986 because federal funds couldn't be traced to the particular program or activity receiving the funds. A lawyer for the National Women's Law Center, based here, said that number now stands at more than 800. However, it's unclear how many of these cases could be reopened.    Seven Republican senators who voted for the bill when it passed 75-14 on Jan. 28 reversed themselves yesterday and voted to uphold the veto. Similarly, the House, which voted 315-98 for the bill March 2, saw an erosion of support yesterday. Many lawmakers said they were responding to the hundreds of phone calls they received in recent days from constituents, many of them evangelical or fundamentalist Christians expressing concern that the measure would interfere with their religious practices.    Many of the calls were generated through an appeal by the conservative Moral Majority, which called the measure &quot;a perverted law&quot; that could force churches to hire &quot;a practicing active homosexual drug addict with AIDS to be a teacher or youth pastor.&quot;    Supporters of the measure decried the Moral Majority campaign as deliberately misleading, and even a leading opponent of the bill, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), said some of the group's statements &quot;may be extreme.&quot; A coalition of several large religious organizations such as the U.S. Catholic Conference and the American Baptist Churches supported the legislation.    ---   John E.
