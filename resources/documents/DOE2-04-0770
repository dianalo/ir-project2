Therewere 27 true-positive, nine true-negative, two false-positive and onefalse-negative. The false-positives and the false-negative occurred inpatients with soft-tissue infections overlying the area of interest.All diagnoses were confirmed by intraoperative bone biopsies and cultures.Bone biopsy and scan were performed within 2 days of each other in 39patients. The overall sensitivity was 97% (27/28), specificity, 82% (9/11)and the diagnostic accuracy, 92% (36/39). The remaining seven patientshad negative [{sup 111}In]WBC scans several months after positive bonebiopsies and definite antibiotic treatment. This suggests that [In]WBCscans become negative after appropriate therapy is undertaken. Interobserverdata was obtained from four nuclear physicians of varying experienceblinded to clinical information. A high degree of agreement was foundin over 90% of the cases. This study demonstrates the utility of [{sup111}In]WBC scans in the diagnosis and follow-up of complicated osteomyelitisand a high level of interobserver agreement in scan interpretation.</TEXT></DOC>
