President Bush arrived at 1:05 p.m. (11:05 p.m. EST Wednesday) onAir Force One at Haneda Airport and was greeted by Chief CabinetSecretary Keizo Obuchi and other Japanese officials.   The president, First Lady Barbara Bush and Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III moved quickly into a motorcade to embark on abusy schedule with a long roster of foreign leaders who came toattend the funeral on Friday. Bush was wearing a dark blue suit witha red striped tie, and Mrs. Bush wore a black coat in the 45-degreechill.   An hour earlier, French President Francois Mitterrand arrived atHaneda. Bush and the French leader planned to have lunch at the U.S.ambassador's mansion in central Tokyo.   Police said traffic on expressways was 50 percent below normalThursday morning and 20 to 30 percent lower than normal on citystreets because many drivers decided not to brave the heavy securityroadblocks.   On Wednesday, a list of 71 arriving foreign leaders included KingHussein of Jordan, King Juan Carlos of Spain and IndonesianPresident Suharto. Dignitaries representing 163 countries will be onhand for the state funeral for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age 87.   Bush has an ambitious agenda of a dozen brief meetings with otherleaders. Bush meets Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita Thursday, andMrs. Bush will take tea with Takeshita's wife, Naoko.   Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, who have made daily visitsto join in a vigil in the chamber in the Imperial Palace whereHirohito's coffin lies, will meet each of the visiting dignitariesin audiences and functions scheduled through Tuesday.   As part of the week's ``funeral diplomacy,'' Takeshita metWednesday with early arrivals, including Finnish President MaunoKoivisto, Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov and PresidentMarshal Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire. He was scheduled to see 40foreign dignitaries before Sunday.   Japanese and Soviet officials, meanwhile, agreed to continuemeetings in March and May aimed at resolving the old dispute overSoviet-held islands north of Japan.   ``The talks were not on concrete issues and did not bear concretefruit ... but positive progress was made in the sense that bothsides agreed to continue meetings,'' said a senior Foreign Ministryofficial, speaking on condition he not be identified.   Japanese authorities, determined to prevent disruptions of thisunprecedented opportunity for diplomatic contacts, began strictinspections of mail and cargo shipments.   Security at the airports where foreign dignitaries were arrivingwas tightened following the discovery Tuesday of timed projectilelaunchers near the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, 40miles northeast of Tokyo.   Police said the launchers apparently were set by radical groupsseeking to disrupt funeral events, but news reports said theirprojectiles did not contain explosive charges. On Wednesday, 7,000uniformed and plainclothes police were deployed in the area,officials said.   In all, 32,000 police will mobilized throughout the city onFriday.   Authorities conducted double-checks of baggage at airports. Cargoand mail shipments were inspected and restricted, and somecommercial flights were been canceled to accommodate arrivingforeign delegations.   Teams of 10 to 20 policemen manned vehicle checkpoints throughoutthe city while others kept a constant surveillance over centralTokyo and the routes to the airports. Some officers poked intogarbage set out at curbside and others searched roadside bushes.   A powerful explosion Feb. 3 at Togo Shrine in central Tokyo,believed to have been carried out by extremists, occurred in acarefully patrolled area about a half-mile from the ShinjukuImperial Gardens, where the funeral will be held.   Projectiles similar to those found at Narita were launched inApril 1986, apparently in an attempt to disrupt plans forcelebrating the 60th year of Hirohito's reign, and the followingmonth, when the leaders of seven major industralized democracies metin Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
