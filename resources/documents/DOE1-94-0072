<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-0072 </DOCNO><TEXT>Assuming that the phase is small we prove that the fixed-angle scatteringamplitude in potential scattering cannot decrease faster than exp(-Ck{theta}logk),where {theta} is the scattering angle and k the centre-of-mass momentum.This result agrees with the explicit calculation of Wu for the gaussianpotential [exp(-C{theta}k{radical}logk)] and with a previous bound derivedfrom the Mandelstam representation with a finite number of subtractions.The applicability of this result outside the framework of potential scatteringis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
