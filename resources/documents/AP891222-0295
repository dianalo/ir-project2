Fraud-mateBoyd Jefferies squeals on others and is freed in appreciation.   Admitted stock manipulator Salim B. Lewis will work as anexecutive in a drug rehabilitation clinic after pleading guilty;stock parker Paul A. Bilzerian will go to prison after a juryconviction.   As the number of cases resolved in the government's Wall Streetfraud investigation grows, one thing is clear: Disparity, notclarity, has been the main characteristic of punishments.   Whether ordering prison time or probation, federal judges inManhattan who have meted out sentences in the crackdown havedecried financial swindling and said they were ``sending amessage'' to Wall Street.   But the message has varied, and judges, defense lawyers andlegal experts appear troubled over whether securities professionalswho plead guilty or are found guilty by juries should go to prisonat all.   ``You are a perfect example of the serious burdens placed upon acourt in trying to deal with this kind of conduct,'' U.S. DistrictJudge Mary Johnson Lowe told Lewis, a respected trader and formerSecurities and Exchange Commission adviser, before sparing himprison time last week.   ``You should be sentenced in a way so that your talents will notbe wasted,'' she said. ``Warehousing your body will be a deterrent.But it will do little to benefit society.''   Lowe's comments were cheered by lawyers who said the punishmentfit the crime _ an isolated incident of scheming to boost a stockprice.   But it was the first time a securities felon received onlyprobation without cooperating with the government. A wide majorityof those who have come before the bench in the last three yearshave gone to prison.   ``Judges will deny it, but there's no doubt that if you pleadguilty the sentence will be lighter than if you go to trial,'' saidElkan Abramowitz, whose client stockbroker Robert Chestman isserving a two-year term after an insider trading conviction.   Jefferies, who collaborated with Boesky, was placed on probationand fined $250,000. He provided information that led to successfulprosecutions of Bilzerian, Lewis, GAF Corp. and its vice chairman,James T. Sherwin.   Bilzerian, a Florida investor, got four years after he wasconvicted of making millions by illegally concealing ownership ofstock in takeover targets by temporarily ``parking'' it withstockbroker Jefferies. Among stock-related offenses, Bilzerian'sterm has been the longest.   The longest overall has been eight years for David Bloom, a24-year-old aspiring financial adviser who was convicted of mailand securities fraud for bilking investors of $15 million he spenton art, fast cars and luxury homes.   Manhattan U.S. attorney's office records show that of 43individuals prosecuted for securities-related offenses since 1986,23 have been sentenced to prison against six placed on probation.The remaining either were acquitted or are awaiting trial orsentencing.   ``You see more sentences of imprisonment now than you did 10 or15 years ago in white-collar fraud cases,'' said criminal defenselawyer Alan Kaufman, who has represented several Wall Streetprofessionals.   Many defense lawyers believe the benchmark for securitiesoffenses should be the three years for Boesky, who was accused oframpant insider trading and cooperated with prosecutors in the casethat has embodied Wall Street's scandals.   Others say that for first-time violators, straight probation andcommunity service should be the standard, along with hefty finesand expulsion from the profession _ punishments they say hurtfinancial executives most while replenishing federal coffers.   ``White-collar criminals should be treated differently,''Abramowitz said. ``They do not pose a physical threat to society.(Financial crime) does not grip the city with fear.   ``It does affect the ethical quality of our society, and to thatextent it is important and should be prosecuted. But the punishmentshould be comparable with the crime in that framework.''   While judges more and more send a message via prison sentencesthat white-collar criminals shouldn't get preferential treatmentjust because they are predominantly white, male and wealthy,``warehousing'' a stock manipulator costs taxpayers.   According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, it cost $26.60 a day,or about $9,700 a year, in fiscal 1988 to keep an inmate at aminimum-security prison camp, where most Wall Street felons aresent.   The number of inmates at such facilities _ the lowest securitylevel in the federal prison system _ was 12,623 as of Dec. 5, up6.1 percent from 11,898 at end of fiscal 1988 and 18 percent from10,686 the previous year.   Off Wall Street, financial scammers increasingly are gettinglengthy prison terms _ hotel queen Leona Helmsley's four years fortax evasion and televangelist Jim Bakker's 45 years for fraud havebeen the most publicized.   New federal criminal sentencing guidelines threaten to increasethe use of prison even more.   The guidelines, which apply to crimes committed after Nov. 1,1987, and as such haven't been used in most of the Wall Streetcases, provide strict sentences for each offense. In white-collarcases, the length of the term often is determined by the dollaramount of the fraud.   Judges have little room to apply discretion based on otherelements, such as whether community service might be more effectivefor defendant and society. Lewis, for instance, whose crimeoccurred in 1986, would have received a mandatory prison sentenceunder the guidelines.   ``They do not take into consideration the differences in conductand people,'' said securities lawyer Gerald Lefcourt. ``Theyattempt to make things uniform where it is impossible to do that.''   According to a U.S. Sentencing Commission study, 57 percent ofcriminal tax-law convicts in 1985 received only probation. Underthe guidelines, the figure would have been 3 percent. In fraudcases, 59 percent got probation; under the guidelines, it wouldhave been 24 percent.   ``The guidelines made a deliberate effort to increase theseverity of white-collar sentences and will greatly increase thefrequency of prison sentences,'' said University of Chicagocriminal law professor Albert Alschuler.   ``You really ought to think about taking the white-collaroffender and reducing him to bankruptcy before you start piling onprison sentences,'' he said.   Defense lawyers generally agree incarceration is necessary insome white-collar cases, but say it's counterproductive andwasteful to send nonviolent felons into a prison system alreadyoverflowing with hard criminals.   Lefcourt said: ``The attitude of the country is somehow you cansolve complicated problems in people's condition by just throwingthe book at everybody. I think that's very unfortunate.''</TEXT><NOTE>End advance Tuesday Dec. 26</NOTE></DOC>
