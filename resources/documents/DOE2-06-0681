<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0681 </DOCNO><TEXT>The intermediate valent behaviour of YbPd/sub 2/Si/sub 2/ has been studiedunder pressure in the temperature range from 1.2 K to 90 K by using the84 keV Moessbauer transition in /sup 170/Yb. At 54 kbar and 4.2 K weobtain an increase of the electric field gradient (EFG) by a factor of{approx_equal} 3. In addition, the EFG varies strongly with temperature,in contrast to the behaviour at ambient pressure. At 1.2 K a change ofthe hyperfine pattern is observed indicating a magnetic character ofthe Yb ion. These results provide evidence of a pressure induced changeof the valence state close to 3+.</TEXT></DOC>
