According to a special study by the Congressional Budget Office,the seeming contradiction works this way:   As Third World farmers increase their output, their countries'growth speeds up too. More growth means higher incomes, especiallywhen Third World governments raise the prices they pay to theirfarmers, as many are now doing. In most of those countries, unlikethe United States, a huge proportion of people still live in thecountry _ including the poorest people.   They not only grow food, they also have to buy some. As they earnmore they buy more, and they buy a greater variety: poor peoplespend a larger part of their income on food than the more prosperousdo. And in some countries the population is growing faster than homeproduction.   ``In many cases, the demand for food grows faster than the supplyof food, resulting in greater food imports,'' says the report,written by Stephen Parker of the CBO's Natural Resources andCommerce Division.   That view has important support in Congress.   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt, chairman of the AgricultureCommittee, said the report ``underscores what seems like a realparadox: that we help U.S. farmers by helping Third Worldagriculture. ... If we ignore this in setting our aid, trade andmacroeconomic policies, we are just shooting ourselves in the foot.''   ``Like all general rules this one has its exceptions. We shouldnot ignore these _ but don't let the exceptions blind us to whereour U.S. interests lie,'' Leahy said.   Some U.S. farmers see Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay as among theleading exceptions, countries where farmers have had direct orindirect aid from the United States. They have become importantcompetitors in one of the most lucrative U.S. crops: soybeans.   ``Concerns have arisen in the American agricultural communityover how U.S. assistance may benefit Third World economies to thedetriment of U.S. farmers,'' said Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,D-Tex., chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.   ``But where assistance, directly from the U.S. or throughmultilateral institutions has been provided and resulted in newcompetition for the U.S., it has also led to an increase in thatcountry's economic and income growth.''   Between 1970 and 1985, U.S. sales of farm products to Third Worldcountries grew from $2.4 billion to $12.7 billion.   The report says that on average people in the Third World consume35 percent fewer calories and 40 percent less protein than Americans.   ``The huge potential consumption among these 3 billion peoplewill become actual as their incomes rise,'' the report predicts.   Because the office represents both parties in Congress, it madeno specific recommendations. But it said recent U.S. governmentreviews suggest that current American aid is not effectively helpingpoor countries to develop. It gave figures that show the Bushadministration seeking less aid for farm development abroad thisyear that President Reagan sought in 1987.   For countries in Asia and the Middle East, the requested figurewas $174.2 million compared with $237.9 million in 1987. The totalfor Latin America was down to $144.5 million from $178.8 million.   Some members of Congress have called such amounts so small as tohave a negligible effect and are working on a completereorganization of U.S. aid programs. Additional money for farmerscomes from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank andothers to which the United States is a major contributor.</TEXT></DOC>
