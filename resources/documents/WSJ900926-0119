Somepeople want her to become the first to be targeted in arecall election.</LP><TEXT>   West Virginians have revered the buckskin-clad Mountaineermascot of the university as the embodiment of the state'smacho frontier past. Many students and alumni are mortifiedthat the pride of West Virginia now uses eyeliner instead ofafter-shave.   Angry football fans have thrown paper cups and ice at Ms.Tennant during games. Others have circulated petitionsdemanding her ouster and passed out bumper stickers andbuttons that read: &quot;We Don't Want a Mountain-dear. Give usback our Mountaineer.&quot;   Other places don't seem to have this problem. Harvardhasn't even figured out what a Crimson looks like, much lesswhat its gender is. Nobody cares whether there's a womanunder the Princeton Tiger-skin. Notre Dame's Leprechaun hasalways been male, although who would know the difference ifit wasn't?   The difference could become an issue elsewhere, of course-- just as it has here. Sitting in the stadium's lower deckduring the Maryland game, Jim Bartley, a Morgantownadvertising man, boos as Ms. Tennant passes by. &quot;Should theFlorida State Seminole be a squaw?&quot; he asks. &quot;Should the USCTrojan be a maid? Should the Texas Longhorn be a milk cow?For 60 years,&quot; he adds, &quot;we've had nothing but total supportfor the Mountaineer, and now she's divided the state.&quot;   Huffs Derek Farley, who graduated from the university twoyears ago, &quot;If finding sanctuary in a 100-year tradition issexist, then you can tattoo it on my chest.&quot;   Ms. Tennant has her supporters. Stores here are sellingsweatshirts emblazoned with a striking dark-haired womandressed like Daniel Boone. The campus newspaper has ralliedbehind Ms. Tennant with glowing editorials. Many alumni,particularly women, call out encouragement when they see her.&quot;Keep it up, Natalie]&quot; yells a woman at a pre-game tailgateparty. &quot;I've got four daughters, and you're a pace-setter]&quot;   University officials have expressed dismay over Ms.Tennant's treatment. &quot;I thought we were more sophisticatedthan this,&quot; says Gordon Thorn, the school's assistant vicepresident for student affairs. &quot;It's discouraging, and itsays we have a long way to go before we can handle this kindof question.&quot;   Ms. Tennant, a journalism major who was raised on a WestVirginia farm, shows a steely indifference toward heropponents. The abuse is directed toward the idea of a femaleMountaineer, she says, not toward herself as a person. &quot;Itkeeps me humble and gives me more drive,&quot; she says of theopposition.   During the game, she scurries through the stands of the60,000-seat stadium, slaps hands with fans and has herpicture taken with children. A small blond-haired boy runs upto her, hands her a quarter and says, &quot;Call me.&quot;   The mascot mess began in the spring, after a student clubselected Ms. Tennant and a male aspirant as finalists in acompetition to become mascot. At a basketball game &quot;cheeroff,&quot; thousands of students baited Ms. Tennant, raucouslyinforming her that she wasn't anatomically fit to beMountaineer. To almost everyone's surprise, the club selectedher anyway.   The next day, the campus statue of the rifle-holding,knife-toting Mountaineer was wearing women's underwear.School officials later sprayed the statue with lubricant tokeep it from being painted.   Some students and alumni want the entire, 22,000-personstudent body to elect a new mascot. They say West Virginia'smountaineer iconography is ample proof that the mascot wasnever meant to wear skirts and pantyhose. Whether on thestate seal or a corporate logo, they say, the moutaineer isalmost always depicted as a virile white male.   The university mascot not only attends athletic events andparades but also gives speeches at high schools, 4-H Clubmeetings, Bible-study classes and pig roasts.   Many students say that about three-quarters of the studentbody, including many women, don't think Ms. Tennant should bethe mascot. Some attribute this to tradition; others, sexism.There's concern that male students will try to take her gunat the football games.   &quot;Some men just hate women,&quot; says Dawn Miller, managingeditor of the Daily Athenaeum, the campus newspaper.   Says Ms. Tennant: &quot;I'm the first female mascot at WestVirginia University, but there were female mountaineers longbefore me, like our grandmothers.&quot;   When humans dress up as tigers, panthers or even, as atSyracuse University, oranges, they rarely display obvious sexcharacteristics. But there's never been any doubt about thegender of the Mountaineer, who dresses in tight-fittingbuckskin with coonskin cap and moccasins. Ms. Tennant'scritics fault her for not having a beard, for being too short(5 feet, 3 1/2 inches), and for not yelling loud enough.Because of her size, she can't carry the state flag at games;it would scrape the ground.   After the Maryland game, an exhausted Ms. Tennant'slace-trimmed suit is streaked with sweat. Her cheeks aresunburned, her hands are smeared with gunpowder and herpinkie finger sports a bruise from shooting the rifle.   &quot;You shot the gun too late]&quot; yells a student from thestands, sunglasses draped around his neck. He also complainsthat she didn't wave the state flag and didn't come up to thestudent section. He recommends that Ms. Tennant study lastyear's mascot from game films.   Yet her enthusiasm for the mascot-ship has won over someof West Virginia's crustiest males. This past summer,attending a pig roast in coal-mining Boone County, she wastold to avoid a 70-year-old resident called &quot;Ol' Buster.&quot;Instead, she marched right up to him, extended her hand andsaid, &quot;I hear you're my biggest fan.&quot;   &quot;The hell I am]&quot; Buster snorted, refusing to shake it.   But Ms. Tennant persisted. She had her rifle; and Busteralso carried a muzzle-loader. Bonded by gunpowder, the two ofthem went to an abandoned field to blast away. &quot;Buster&quot; --Mosie Atkins -- was won over. Today he offers her hisultimate compliment for her tomboyish toughness. &quot;Hell, she'sworse than a damn boy]&quot; he says in admiration.</TEXT></DOC>
