 So what are people doing with all of those GUIgizmos?andP;  Rumor has it that after completing the requisite 40 hours of iconcoloring and design, Windows users start to turn their attention to actuallydoing productive work with their machines.andP;  As often as not, the first &quot;real&quot;application that gets installed on a Windows machine is a word processor.andM;One would certainly be within his right to wonder why.andP;  After all, MicrosoftWindows Write comes with Windows 3.0.andP;  We'll grant that White fills most ofthe occasional word mangler's needs.andP;  Hey, it supports search and replace,headers and footers, subscripts and superscripts, underlining, italics,left/right/center alignment of paragraphs, tabs, and indentation--in short,all of the basic features that you'd expect from any $5 blister-packed wordprocessor.andM;The bottom line is that most users end up wanting more-powerful formattingfeatures, better support for including graphics in documents, andmore-precise control over next placement and appearance.andM;Many DOS expatriates are already used to more-powerful packages than Write.andO;Unfortunately, those same folks are also used to the jack-rabbit-quick textmanipulation of the DOS versions of WordPerfect or Microsoft Word.andP;  If you'reone of those souls, be prepared for a period of attitude adjustment whenmaking the move to Windows-based word processing.andP;  Just about everything willtake more time under Windows, regardless of what package you end upselecting.andP;  If you're a Windows Womb Child (the PC equivalent of babyboomer), your sense of time and speed have been prewarped at the factory.andM;We recently fired up three upper-echelon Windows-based word processors on ourtrusty old Advanced Logic Research Model 80, and took them out for a spin.andO;We were rather surprised at the noticeable delays in screen refresh duringscrolling and document-reformatting operations.andP;  That gave us more than amoment's pause.andP;  After all, we were using a 25MHz 80486 with four megabytesof RAM and a VGA card based on Tseng Labs' zippy new ET4000 display chip.andO;What was occasionally irksome to us would likely be downright painful on a16MHz 386SX, and guaranteed suicide on a 286 machine.andM;Most Windows word processors address the scree-refresh issue by offering a&quot;draft&quot; mode of text entry in addition to the WYSIWYG mode.andP;  In draft mode,the slick-looking fonts for which you bought Windows vanish, and are replacedby chunky, readable, one-size-fits-all characters guaranteed to snap queasyWindows converts out of DOS withdrawal.andP;  In draft mode, text scrolling comesa lot closer to DOS-like performance.andP;  If you're concerned with quick screenrefresh and response, do most of your text entry and revision work in draftmode and only turn to WYSIWYG when it's time to format the document forappearance.andM;If you're regularly going to print documents that are more than a few pageslong with a Windows word processor, you can look forward to frequent breakswhenever you print a document.andP;  All of the full-function Windows wordprocessing packages we've tried like to tap dance on a hard drive for 15 to30 seconds per page before handing off to the Windows Print Manger.andM;So much for the downside.andP;  The good news is that, with any of these Windowsword packages, you have more control over the appearance of things than theaverage banana-republic dictator.andP;  Text and graphics can be inserted,manipulated, and precisely placed with ease and immediate visual feedback.andM;Unless you're willing to spend the rest of your life staring at Windows'dynamic default metafonts (Courier, Times Roman, and Helvetica), you're goingto need something to expand your font horizons.andP;  Also, anyone who has triedusing large point sizes in Windows knows that &quot;jagged edge&quot; is more than justa Hollywood murder myster.andP;  Adobe Type Manager (ATM) and ATM Plus Packproduce smooth-edged characters on the fly and add a fistful of scalablefonts to your Windows 3.0 environment and printer.andM;If you're one of the Mongol hordes with a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet III orIIIP, there's another avenue open to you.andP;  Both of the aforementioned lasershave scalable fonts built into them.andP;  HP's Intellifont for Windows softwaretakes care of building Windows screen fonts on the fly and lets the printerhandle scaling the output.andP;  Rather than dense bitmaps, you'll be sending afew PCL5 commands and raw character strings, markedly speeding up the entireprinting process.andP;  Add one or two of HP's scalabe font cartridges to roundout your font family and you're ready to cook some serious alphabet soup.andM;Here's a quick look at three contenders for top honors in industrial-strengthWindows word processing.andM;Microsoft Word for WindowsandM;Microsoft's Word for Windows has the plainest-looking user interface of thetrio we tested, but its powerful macro and template facilities set it apartfrom the competition.andP;  Mouse-sensitive command fields can be embedded withindocuments; the fields can be used to prompt input from the operator, evaluatethe entered values, and trigger other macros, based upon the results.andP;  Word'sDynamic Data Exchange (DDE) facilities allow permanent links to beestablished between cells in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and fields in aWord document.andP;  We suspect that an experienced system designer could actuallyuse the macro and DDE facility to create documents that are actuallyquasi-applications.andM;Word for Windows also incorporates the same features that have made MicrosoftWord for DOS a favorite with professionals who create high volumes of heavilyformatted text.andP;  Word's style sheets allow you to define and store groups ofmultiple complex formatting commands as &quot;styles.&quot;andP;  After they are defined,all of the command groups can be invoked in a simple, single operation.andP;  Wordis also well-suited to deal with treaties from the guys in white lab coats,with special support for typesetting scientific equations.andM;Word's &quot;ruler&quot; and &quot;ribbon&quot; put frequently used formatting commands onscreen,where you can get at them quickly.andP;  We've seen similar systems on theMacintosh, but what we haven't come across before are the cursor-sensitive,up-front and point-size indicators.andM;We had head complaints from Word from Windows users about long print times.andO;Word does take a bit longer to process each page, but none of products wetried were track stars.andM;Most of the complex Window's applications we've seen tend to be on the largeside, and Word for Windows is no exception.andP;  Even without the 1.2Mb of filesfor the online tutorial, you'll still need a whopping 3Mb of disk space toinstall Word.andP;  However, all that space is put to good use.andP;  Word has anexcellent thesaurus and spelling dictionary, and solid support for inserting,cropping, and scaling graphics.andM;Word for Windows has the steepest learning curve of the packages we purveyed,but those who are willing to invest the time will likely receive ample rewardfor their efforts.andM;Ami ProfessionalandM;Ami Professional is arguably the best-handling big stick in the Windows wordprocessing world.andP;  The most-fascinating thing about Ami is that it's asleeper.andP;  There's far more power in this word processor than first meets theeye.andM;The majority of the Ami's functions are eerily intuitive.andP;  After a half-hourwith the package, we had the feeling that we could figure out how to do justabout anything we desired without the aid of a manual or a help, file.andM;Let's give credit where it's due.andP;  Ami was the first Windows word processorwe saw that implements onscreen shortcut icons that are quicker and moreconvenient to use then the usual Windows pull-down menus.andP;  Ami also makes iteasy to traverse the pull-down menus using the keyboard.andP;  The assignments ofthe program's keyboard shortcuts are well-thought-out and make tossing textwith or without a mouse a surprisingly effortless experience.andM;Ami's prerolled style sheets are tastefully rendered.andP;  There are over twodozen of them, including overheads for presentations, FAX cover sheets,standard report formats, memorandums, business letters, newsletters,bulletins, and business letters.andP;  Ami lets you make the most of its DDElinks.andP;  Its graphing module contains over 50 options, includingthre-dimensional charting.andP;  If an imported or internally generated chartisn't exactly to your liking, Ami Professional's integrated Draw module makesshort work of touching up or adding text to graphics.andP;  Ami Pro comes with asmall bundle of clip art, including a stylishly rendered Uzi machine gun forinter-gang correspondence.andM;If you're not into heavy artillery, don't forget Ami Pro's little brother.andO;At $199.95, plain-vanilla Ami doesn't have all the bells and whistles of itsmore-costly sibling, but it's more than adequate for all but themost-demanding word processing chores, and is very easy to learn.andM;The folks at Lotus Development Corp. liked Samna's Ami products so much thatthey bought the company.andP;  We were unable to verify rumors that Jim Manzi willappear in an upcoming Ami Professional television spot.andM;Professional Write PlusandM;In terms of overall feel and gestalt, Professional Write Plus gets our votefor first Cyberpunk Windows Word Processor.andP;  Forget about Big Brotherdeciding what commands go on the icon bar.andP;  Professional Write Plus lets youselect the function and its location.andM;Using PW Plus feels good.andP;  Although it has a diverse and flexible featureset, its command and menu organization has a balanced, logical feel.andP;  PW Plusis not likely to scare off a middle-level corporate manager on firstencounter, but it has enough depth to handle documents that require complexformatting.andM;Besides spelling checker and thesaurus, PW Plus also includes the Grammatikgrammar checker.andP;  While not recommended for the easily depressed, Grammatikcan be used effectively to keep the verbosity and downright-silly word usageof the aforementioned managers in check.andM;PW Plus' electronic-mail front end is designed to work hand-in-hand withNovell's popular Message.andP;  Handling System.andP;  MHS users can send and receivemail while editing a document, without leaving the program.andM;PW Plus supports seven different document-viewing modes, including areasonably quick draft and an interesting Full-Page View with editcapability.andP;  If neither the draft nor the standard WYSIWYG display mode is toyour liking, then one of the other five will likely fill the bill.andM;PW Plus' graphics support also makes sense.andP;  Graphics are treated as frames,whi0ch may be grouped, scaled, rotated, sized, and inverted.andP;  Attaching textto frames is a simple process, and the text retains editability.andM;Disk storage required for Professional Write Plus tips the scales at 4Mb.andP;  Beprepared for slightly more-frequent delays than average during WYSIWYG scrolloperations, and well-above-average pauses when using the scroll slider tomake a jump of more than several pages.andM;Shopping TipsandM;All of these upscale Windows word processors are capable of serving a widevariety of wordsmithing requirements.andP;  Windows users who don't want to dealwith too many options or a high list price will probably prefer ProfessionalWrite Plus.andP;  Those who demand ease of use, coupled with industrial-strengthformatting and graphics, are likely candidates for Ami Professional.andP;  Powerusers who want to create extremely powerful customized documents with complexDDE links will find much to admire in Word for Windows.andM;We expect another contender for the Windows word processing crown to weigh inbefore the end of the summer.andP;  Based on what we've seen in WordPerfect 2.0for the Mac, we're eagerly awaiting the Windows version.andP;  For now, we'll callit a draw.andP;  Of course, since there's no reigning champ, you can cast thedeciding vote.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
