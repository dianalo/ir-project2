 From your telephone linesto your palm lines, from your dreams to your cholesterol level, everythingcan be subjected to analysis.andM;So if you thought no one noticed your office computer habits, guess again.andO;Next on the list for exhaustive observation and analysis may be how and whenyou use a computer.andM;Government-sponsored research is providing new approaches to computers andlocal area network security.andP;  These approaches, generally called &quot;intrusiondetection systems,&quot; use expert systems technologies and behavioral profilesdrawn from samplings of everday computer use to spot activities that are outof the ordinary.andP;  Any deviations from historical use, supporters believe,could indicate security violations.andM;Government and military demand for watchdog systems have prompted much of thedevelopment, but there also has been interest at commercial sites.andP;  Currentlyavailable computer access controls have too often failed to stop hackers anddisgruntled or devious employees.andP;  Security packages such as IBM's ResourceAccess Control Facility (RACF) can collect mounds of usage data, but fewcompanies or government agencies have the ability or the inclination to siftthrough it all.andM;Now, several U.S.andP;  government agencies are funding research into systems thatsort through such usage data to detect behaviors that could signal securityviolations.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Navy is using SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif.,andO;to design one new security system; the Department of Energy employs LosAlamos National Laboratory in Los alamos, N.M., for another, and the U.S.andO;Air Force uses the National Computer Security Center and Tractor AppliedSciences Division of Tractor Inc. in Austin, Texas, for separate projects.andP;  Adistributed intrusion detection system also is being devised for thegovernment's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET).andM;The project being developed for the Navy by SRI, called Intrusion DetectionExpert System (IDES), typifies the new approach to computer and networksecurity.andP;  It uses artificial intelligence technologies to compare users'activities on a workstation network against historical profiles and analyzethe significance of any discrepancies.andP;  Although still considered anexperimental project, the system has attracted the attention of companiessuch as Rockwell International Corp. of Seal Beach, Calif.andM;Rockwell hopes to incorporate IDES technology in its network security plansnext year.andP;  That's also when the Federal Bureau of Investigation hopes tostart running IDES out of its Washington, D.C., headquarters.andP;  Other researchprojects also are expected to surface next year.andP;  The system being developedby Tracor for the Air Force, called Haystack, is currently scheduled forfield tests.andP;  If that testing is successful, the Air Force hopes to implementthe technology broadly, a spokesman says.andM;A system similar to IDES was built from scratch by New York City financialservices giant Citicorp.andP;  &quot;We are using artificial intelligence to come upwith security software ...andP;  to set a profile on a particular user and notemajor variances from that [profile],&quot; says Bern Flaherty, Citicorp's managerof corporate security.andP;  Like IDES, Citicorp's system compares a user'scurrent behavior with his or her historical computer activity to determineany unusual behavior.andM;The technology's potential for widespread use is clear.andP;  One Citicorpapplication monitors employees responsible for processing vendor invoices.andO;Usage profiles establish what time of the week or month employees should beentering invoices andfor which vendors.andP;  &quot;In this case, it [profile analysis]is run for all inputters or verifiers, since these are high-risk systemswhere funds are involved,&quot; says Flaherty.andM;The company informs employees that they are being monitored, a practiceCiticorp views favorably, as the company sees the warnings as a deterrent.andO;&quot;We find it's well in our interest to publicize it a lot,&quot; Flaherty says.andM;The Citicorp security manager is unable to divulge any information onpaybacks of its security systems.andP;  However, Flaherty says that the company'saudit department has been able to identify savings, noting: &quot;These kind ofinsider, internal audit systems are well worth the money.&quot;andM;Most companies interested in adopting profiling as part of their securityplans currently must use specialists such as SRI or--as in the case ofCiticorp--develop their own.andP;  Commercial versions of such security packagesaren't expected for some time and may be prove too expensive for all butlarge companies when they are available.andP;  &quot;There may be limited capabilitythings [on the market] in a year,&quot; says Teresa Lunt, a SRI senior computerscientist involved in the IDES project.andM;SRI officials already have commercial users willing to pay in the severalhundred thousand dollar range for a working intrusion detection system.andP;  TheAir Force, meanwhile, is trying to keep its cost low by using personalcomputers and by limiting functionality.andP;  However, intrusion detectionsystems are not likely to be within reach of the cost conscious anytime soon.andM;The essence of profiling systems such as IDES are the algorithms applied tothe data.andP;  These statistical procedures allow IDES to develop profiles ofusers' behavior that can be modified and expanded on a regular basis.andO;Against these dynamic profiles, the algorithms can then check to see if anyparticular behavior is significantly anomalous.andM;To establish an initial profile of user behavior, IDES takes up to 36measurements.andP;  A decay factor built into the system means that the profilesare built up mainly from behavior occurring within a preset time limit, suchas the last 50 days.andP;  Eventually, SRI plans for IDES to provide real-timedetection of anomalies while users are still at the keyboard.andM;Differences Among SystemsandM;Various systems create a profile of users' historical behavior in differentways.andP;  With IDES, computer-usage profiles of a person or groups of people areupdated daily in order to maintain current behavioral profiles.andP;  Otherprojects, such the one being developed for the Air Force, do not make dailyupdates.andP;  The Air Force system combines several months of audit data withgeneral rules of what is reasonable behavior in certain job categories.andP;  Itsprofiles are then typically measured against the daily audit data downloadedfrom host systems.andM;As leading edge as these security systems may appear, not everyone isconvinced of their usefulness.andP;  One reason is their reliance on profiles todifferentiate routine from potentially dangerous behaviors.andP;  Developers ofthese systems believe that security violations represent abnormal behaviorthat can easily be detected.andP;  As a very simple example, Joe typically mightlog in only between 9:00 A.M.andP;  and 5:00 P.M., so if his password is invokedat 2:00 A.M., suspicions might well be aroused.andP;  But skeptics ask, What ifJoe couldn't sleep well that night and decided to do some work?andP;  They alsosay some behaviors deviate so much from one day to the next that a meaningfulprofile is hard to build.andM;Another problem with the use of profiles is that they may have difficultyguarding against premeditated activity changes.andP;  A person who knows he'sbeing monitored could slowly alter his behavior over time to maskquestionable activity.andP;  Such steady changes will likely be incorporated intothe profile, thus avoiding suspicion and preventing the system from flaggingthe behavior as unusual.andM;Researchers have tried to guard against such problems by measuring a largenumber of variables.andP;  Also, system administrators can easily customize thesystem to take into account variables such as the shelf life of data, changesin job categories, vacation schedules, etc.andM;Coupling expert systems technology with profiling also provides someprotection against deliberate changes intended to alter a behavioral profile.andO;For example, an expert system would have no difficulty detecting a problem ifthe same password were used to log on from multiple locations over a shortperiod of time.andP;  But if a company employee with a legitimate password startslogging in from his home on Sunday mornings, an expert system probablywouldn't recognize that as a violation.andM;Researchers believe that trend analysis, which observes how fast and in whatdirection a user's normal behavior changes, may be an answer.andP;  &quot;One of theproblems with expert systems is that you need to think up all the ways tobreak into a computer,&quot; says SRI's Lunt.andP;  &quot;The strength of the statisticalapproach is you find anomalies you would never have thought up.&quot;andM;Is Big Brother Watching?andM;Such minute evaluations of user activities may evoke images of GeorgeOrwell's Big Brother in some minds, but supporters of these systems insistthat there's nothing wrong with being kept informed of unusual activities.andO;&quot;The notion is not 'let's get somebody and send 20,000 volts down the line,&quot;remarks Captain Tim Grance of the Air Force Cryptologic Support Center atKelly Air Force Base in San Antonio.andP;  &quot;We're just saying 'lets flag this ...andO;[for someone] to take a look at.'andP;  Maybe he just picks up the phone and callsthe boss in that section and says 'Was Joe working late last night?'&quot;andM;As Grance indicates, it will be up to those in charge to set the parametersthat determine which activities are simply out of the ordinary whichrepresent real security violations.andP;  Developers of these systems are thefirst to admit that atypical behavior does not always translate into asecurity threat, nor should it be interpreted that way.andP;  &quot;Just becausesomething is called an anomaly, it's not necessarily bad,&quot; says Cris Castro,SRI's director of information security.andP;  &quot;It could be something logical likeI went into work on a Saturday or I borrowed someone else's terminal.&quot;andM;Furthermore, gathering a tremendous amount of detail on every employee isprobably not necessary.andP;  Profiles can be constructed of groups rather thanindividuals.andP;  These groups can be formed by department, by geographiclocation, by expertise with a computer and so on.andM;In fact, one of the advantages of these new security systems is their abilityto filter the information collected.andP;  By boiling information down into a moreconcise format, supporters say, these security systems are an improvementover previous security arrangements.andP;  &quot;Our experience was [that previousaudit reports were] just too much to digest.andP;  Now when we get exceptionreports, there's a reason to read them,&quot; says Citicorp's Flaherty.andM;&quot;There has to be a throttle there,&quot; confirms Stephen Smaha, founder ofHaystack Laboratories Inc. in Austin.andP;  Smaha helped develop Tracor's Haystacksecurity system and now works under contract with Los Alamos to perfect thesystem for the Air Force.andP;  &quot;On Haystack, we have a volume switch,&quot; whichenables administrators to control the type of information gathered.andM;More readable reports also can help spot worrisome trends such as theconstant abuse of a password.andP;  Companies say they need that help.andM;Take Rockwell as an example.andP;  It currently uses an access control system thatgenerates anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 violation reports a month.andP;  Thattranslates into a daily stack of paper reports a couple of inches thick,according to Hal Tipton, manager of information security at the aerospacecompany.andP;  The information currently is reviewed in its raw form by securityadministrators.andP;  &quot;It's difficult to pour through that carefully,&quot; Tiptonsays.andP;  &quot;Now we just scan it.&quot;andP;  An intrusion detection system would reduce thereport into a couple of pages at the most.andM;IS as the Enemy?andM;If the thought of these systems makes you uneasy, that's the point.andP;  Behindthe development of profiling systems is the perception, particularly by thosein the government, that most security violations are caused by employees.andO;Such insiders may be authorized to use certain resources but go on to evadestandard controls to access classified systems.andP;  Or they may be individualswith approved access who misuse those privileges.andP;  Put even more bluntly, oneof the groups most feared are data-processing personnel.andM;&quot;The people most organizations worry about are systems programmers,&quot; saysHaystack's Smaha.andP;  That's because programmers have detailed knowledge of theinner workings of computers and their security features.andM;&quot;The biggest vulnerability are those with the highest level of access andthose who know how to circumvent the system from the highest level,&quot; agreesCiticorp's Flaherty.andP;  Insiders generally represent the greatest threat to thefinancial industry, he says.andP;  &quot;The biggest volume [of security violations]are people on the inside, not hackers, but people with authorized access.&quot;andM;But not everyone agrees.andP;  Rockwell's Tipton believes external break-ins aremore important because they tend to create bad publicity.andP;  In addition, therewere internal security threats long before computers arrived on the scene, hesays.andM;Nonetheless, suspicion is built into intrusion systems.andP;  Some projects evenrun the applications on separate computers to prevent access by users on theother systems being monitored.andP;  For instance, the Haystack system performsits analysis on a dedicated AT-compatible personal computer.andM;No matter how elaborate the protections and how expensive their commercialoffspring may prove, researchers readily admit there's no such thing as afoolproof security system.andP;  &quot;We're probably not going to prevent the highlydevious and intelligent, skilled Rasputin [from getting] in the system,&quot;acknowledges Grance.andP;  &quot;We're just trying to do a good job, not a perfectjob.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
