But the researchers cautioned against assuming the results applyto all of the nation's hospitals.   Physicians improperly treated patients complaining of chestpains, prescribed the wrong kind of antibiotics for pneumonia andmisdiagnosed strokes, according to the study published in today'sedition of The Annals of Internal Medicine.   The study noted that the findings are preliminary, and that theerrors were common and relatively easy to correct.   ``A hospital's quality assurance committee should approach thesefindings with a certain sense of optimism,'' the study said.``Although these probably preventable deaths occurred with what weconsider surprising frequency, they were due to a small number of... causes.''   All three of the physician-panelists who reviewed the 12hospitals' records agreed that 14 percent of the deaths probablycould have been prevented. Two of the three agreed that 27 percentof the deaths were probably preventable, the study said.   Dr. Robert W. Dubois, who headed the study, said hospitalpatients should not be alarmed.   ``The overwhelming majority _ over 95 percent _ of the peopleadmitted to a hospital don't die. This is a non-issue for them,''he said. ``So it's important to put this in perspective. Of theone-quarter to one-sixth of those who do die, their death wasprobably preventable.''   The study by the Rand Corp., a Santa Monica-based think tank,was based on a review of 182 patients who died in 1985 at hospitalsowned by American Medical International of Beverly Hills, a chainof 115 hospitals in the United States and abroad.   AMI sponsored the study and made extensive changes in itsquality control program based on findings that were privatelyreleased, a spokesman said.   AMI spokesman Mick Taylor said the study should send warningsignals to other hosptials.   ``It suggests there still remains a need for control mechanismsthat very precisely define what quality is, and then very closelymonitor every activity within a hospital that impacts a patient,''Taylor said.   The study found that the average patient whose death might havebeen prevented was between ages 75 and 79, and suffered less severeillnesses than those whose deaths were unavoidable.   The deaths of 23 heart attack patients probably could have beenprevented had doctors not made errors in treatment, the majority ofpanelists said.   For instance, the study found that a number of patients receivedeither no treatment or only single doses of nitroglycerine ormorphine after complaining of chest pains.   The study suggested that doctors should have been moreaggressive in the treatment, intervening with drugs or surgery toavert what would be fatal heart attacks.   Errors in diagnosis were the main cause of nine deaths fromstrokes, the majority of panelists found. In some cases, doctorsfailed to administer such diagnostic procedures as a spinal tap andblood cultures.   The majority of panelists also found that errors in bothdiagnosis and treatment led to 17 deaths from pneumonia.</TEXT></DOC>
