Japanese and Korean car manufacturers posted the largest increases in U.S. car sales. Cars built in Japan accounted for 22.5% of last year's total U.S. sales, up slightly from 22.2% in 1986. Americans bought 319,832 Korean-made cars in 1987, an 89.4% jump from 1986, boosting the Korean share of the U.S. market to 3.1% from 1.5% a year earlier.    The overall number of imported cars sold in the U.S. last year, including European autos, was 3.1 million, or 30.6% of the total market, compared with 28.2% of the market in 1986.    While most auto makers reported late December sales on Wednesday, Chrysler Corp. didn't, and thus final 1987 sales and market-share figures weren't available until yesterday. Chrysler's late-December sales of U.S.-made cars dropped nearly 25% to 32,021 vehicles.    Americans bought 14.9 million cars and light trucks -- including pickups, mini-vans and Jeep-type vehicles -- in 1987. That's a 7.3% decline from the 16 million vehicles in 1986.    Sales of cars and light trucks in the Dec. 21-31 period totaled 331,551, down 18.2% from a year earlier. The drop in late December had been expected because of the rush a year ago to buy cars before a federal tax law change ended the sales tax deduction.    On a seasonally adjusted basis, domestic-made cars sold in late December at a rate of 7.2 million annually. That's well below the 10.5 million rate in the 1986 record year, but down only slightly from the mid-December 1987 rate of 7.6 million.    The late December seasonally adjusted sales pace slightly exceeded the actual number of domestic-made cars -- 7.1 million -- sold last year. The number represents a 13.8% decline from 1986, when 8.2 million domestic-made cars were sold.    In a shrinking market, imports usually increase their share by at least holding steady, or slightly increasing. But it may be difficult for importers to continue that pattern in 1988 because the weak dollar prompted Japanese and European car makers to sharply raise prices during the last two years.    That, at least, is what Big Three auto executives hope, and they've been getting some encouragement from the drop in sales of luxury European imported cars in recent months. Still, however, Big Three executives have been frustrated in the past year by their inability to take away market share from foreign auto makers. Some Big Three executives theorize that importers -- especially the Japanese -- have built up such a loyal customer base in the U.S. that their sales will hold up for a while, despite big price increases. Some analysts, however, contend that the Big Three are missing an opportunity by not holding the line enough on prices to lure import buyers.    While U.S. car sales fell in 1987, sales of light trucks grew 1.4% to 4.7 million from 4.6 million a year earlier. However, late-December truck sales in the U.S. were down 8.7%, to 122,188, in 1987 from 133,880 in 1986.    ---   Ella Newsome contributed to this article.    ---            Percentage of Total U.S. Car Market                              Dec.
