For Santiago and other waterfront residents in Florida, thealligator's image has changed dramatically from an amusing visitorto a deadly menace _ a change prompted by the recent fatalalligator attack on a 4-year-old girl in the Gulf Coast communityof Englewood.   Erin Glover was walking a dog with two playmates in theankle-deep water of a pond June 4 when a 10{ foot-long bull gatorlunged from the water and snapped the child in its jaws, draggingher underwater to her death.   For Santiago, the turf war between man and beast heats upwhenever he broils a couple of steaks on his charcoal grill in theDade County neighborhood, wafting an aroma that one 6-foot``neighborhood'' gator finds irresistible.   ``He crawls up the bank right into our back yard and sits therewith his back arched _ just staring,'' said Santiago, a 67-year-oldCuban exile who moved in last year. ``The last time I went and gotmy gun, but he saw me coming and ran away.''   ``We're seeing a lot of panic out there,'' said Lt. DickLawrence of the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.   In the week following Erin's death, game officials in thestate's five regional offices were swamped with 849 complaints fromresidents wanting alligators removed _ about five times the normalload.   ``I try to calm them down but they won't take `no' for ananswer,'' said Lawrence, who supervises the nuisance-alligatorprogram in 10 south Florida counties. ``Some say if we don't comeout there and destroy the gator in their neighborhood, they'regoing to do it themselves,''   Game officials last week received a report that a hystericalwoman living near the fatal attack ``bashed a 3-foot gator's headin.''   ``It made her feel a little bit better, but it didn't accomplishanything,'' said Lt. Jim Farrior of the game commisson, adding thatalligators that small eat only minnows and frogs, not people.   About 80 percent of the complaints result in a permit issued todestroy the gator, said Lt. Mitchell Brown in Lakeland. Last year,3,853 alligators were killed, he said.   ``Our main concerns are with a gator that's been fed,'' said Lt.Jim Huffstodt, a game commission spokesman in West Palm Beach.``People think it's real cute to treat the gator like a pet andgive it a name and toss it scraps of food and marshmallows.   ``Over time, the gator loses its fear of people and begins toassociate people with food _ that's setting the stage for atragedy,'' Huffstodt said. He added that any bold action towardhumans, pets or livestock is enough to order a gator destroyed.   That job is turned over to state-licensed trappers, a selectgroup of experts allowed to kill alligators and profit from thearmored underbelly skin and the bland-tasting meat.   But the fact is, the odds of getting attacked by a gator inFlorida are about the same as getting struck by lightning, gameofficials say.   The latest death marks the sixth documented gator killing alongwith 95 unprovoked attacks in Florida since 1948, according to gamecommission statistics.   ``These are the consequences we face as a growing state wherepeople choose to crowd their houses onto the alligator's nativehabitat,'' said Bernie Yokel of the Florida Audubon Society inMaitland. ``We sometimes forget the gator was here first.''   Biologists estimate there are anywhere from 1 million to 6million gators in Florida, nesting in swamps and marshes and evenwinding their way through drainage tunnels into freshwater pocketsof sprawling urban areas.   In September, the state will lift a 1962 hunting ban and open atightly controlled month-long season with a strict kill limit of3,000 gators, a number not expected to make a dent in the hugepopulation.   But homeowner Santiago says he still feels a cold shiver of fearwhenever he hears the gator's low bellow in the night.   Santiago has forbidden his nine young grandchildren from playingnear the water when they visit; he has ordered a chain-link fencebuilt around his home and he has called on game officials to removehis problem gator.   ``I couldn't live with myself,'' he said, ``if anything happenedto one of my grandchildren.''</TEXT></DOC>
