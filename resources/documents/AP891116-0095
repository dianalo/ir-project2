The House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materialsbegan an investigation of the agreement as the American CancerSociety launched its 13th annual Great American Smokeout.   Under the agreement, Philip Morris will donate $600,000 to theNational Archives Trust Fund in exchange for authority to publishor broadcast announcements and materials promoting the 200thanniversary of the Bill of Rights. The materials carry the names ofboth Philip Morris and the National Archives.   ``It's not the text of the ad that troubles me, it's thecontext,'' said Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.   ``I am embarrassed, too, as a member of Congress by thepervasive presence of tobacco companies on Capitol Hill ... youcan't have an event without it being cosponsored by the cigaretteindustry,'' said Atkins.   But Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said, ``We have a long andtime-honored practice in the United States of allowing corporateAmerica to collaborate with public agencies in order to advertisepublic events.''   ``I would say, let's make one exception. Let's take acorporation that sells a product that kills the largest number ofAmericans ... let's say we'll put them in a little differentcategory,'' countered Atkins.   ``Philip Morris has bought the exclusive rights to theConstitution, which we entrusted to the National Archives, for themodern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or $600,000,'' Rep. ThomasLuken, D-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, said in announcingtoday's hearing.   Luken and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., called Wednesday forinvestigations into the two-year agreement between Philip Morrisand the Archives after a consumer health group urged that thecontract be revoked.   ``It's more than coincidental'' that the bicentennial campaignbegan shortly before the society's annual nationwide cigarette-freeday, said Cancer Society spokesman Alan Davis.   ``Every year just prior to the smokeout one company or anothertries to grab headlines and change the agenda,'' Davis said.   ``There is no cigarette called Philip Morris,'' said Guy L.Smith, the company's vice president of corporate affairs. He saidhe did not believe the announcements violated the ad ban.   ``In the same week that the Berlin Wall is being torn down, thatpeople in this country are being criticized for celebrating theBill of Rights is very strange,'' Smith said.   Congress specifically encourages the Archives to accepttax-exempt donations ``to enhance its archival and outreachactivities,'' said Archives' spokeswoman Susan Cooper.   She also said such efforts by the cigarette maker are nodifferent from the company's past sponsorship of exhibits at theNational Gallery of Art.   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-New Mexico, has written Don Wilson, thearchivist of the United States, questioning how and why theagreement was made. The Health Research Group, a consumer healthgroup, last week wrote Bingaman asking Congress to revoke theAugust agreement.   Critics question whether the broadcast announcements violate a1971 federal ban on cigarette advertisements on television andradio.   ``The Philip Morris ads are running on television and do notcontain any health warning and apparently are a flagrant violationof the law prohibiting such video commercials,'' Luken said.   ``You have to ask what does advertising mean,'' said JohnBanzhaf, chief counsel for Action on Smoking and Health, a consumergroup that led efforts for the federal restrictions. ``It seems tome this is advertising, since at least one of their purposes,directly or indirectly, is to encourage the sale of cigarettes,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
