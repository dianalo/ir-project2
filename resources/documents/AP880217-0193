A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hereoverturned a district judge's finding that the Humane Society ofthe United States lacked the requisite legal standing to sue theInterior Department to stop hunting on nine federal wildlifepreserves.   ``The gist of this grievance is that the existence of hunting onwildlife refuges forces society members to witness animal corpsesand environmental degradation, in addition to depleting the supplyof animals and birds that refuge visitors seek to view,'' the courtsaid in an opinion written by Judge Patricia Wald, chief judge.   ``These are classic aesthetic interests, which have alwaysenjoyed protection under standing analysis,'' Wald wrote.   David J. Hayes, a Washington attorney who represented the HumaneSociety, called the decision significant because ``it confirms thatenvironmental groups like the Humane Society have the right tobring actions based on their members' concerns about harms to theiraesthetic interests.''   An appellate decision upholding the dismissal of the lawsuit byU.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery ``would have made itdifficult for any wildlife group to bring suit for the protectionof wildlife,'' Hayes said.   While ruling the society had a legal right to sue, the courtupheld the Interior Department's decision to allow waterfowlhunting on Chincoteague Island, Va.   The appeals court sent the case back to Flannery to rule on themerits of the Humane Society's claims that the Interior Departmenthad not properly evaluated the wildlife populations of otherpreserves before allowing hunting.   James Goodrich, executive vice president of the WildlifeLegislative Fund of America, Inc., a hunters' group, said he wasdisappointed by the court's decision. But he predicted that huntingwould be upheld at the other preserves.   ``On a single refuge, the appeals court said that everything wasproper in permitting hunting. Assumedly that would apply to allother refuges,'' Goodrich said.</TEXT></DOC>
