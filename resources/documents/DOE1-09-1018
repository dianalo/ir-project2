In this study, initiationof detonation in H{sub 2}-O{sub 2}-Ar, CH{sub 4}-O{sub 2} and C{sub 2}H{sub6}-O{sub 2} mixtures by shock wave has been studied in a two-stage shocktube. The threshold shock strength to induce detonation directly hasbeen experimentally decided in these gas mixtures, where the effectsof the initial pressure, and the compositions of the gas mixtures aresystematically examined. The numerical solutions of the chemical reactingsystems for these gas mixtures are compared with the observed thresholdvalues of the incident shock speed. The experimental results on thesethreshold values for the direct initiation of detonation pretty wellagreee with the numerical calculations. This suggests that the initiationmechanism of detonation can be explained by a homogeneous model. (9 figs,16 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
