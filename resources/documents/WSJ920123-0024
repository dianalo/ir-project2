Crude oil for March delivery rose 22 cents a barrel tosettle at $18.94 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. InLondon, crude oil futures were 20 cents to 33 cents a barrelhigher on the International Petroleum Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   Two more OPEC members -- Indonesia and the United ArabEmirates -- announced temporary output cuts of 25,000 and50,000 barrels a day, respectively, to help prop up prices.But it wasn't clear what role this may have had inyesterday's pricing turnaround.   Some traders attributed the rally to technical factors.But the oil ministers of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries meet Feb. 12 in Geneva to decide onproduction levels for the next few months. And some of themare predicting a price rebound leading up to that meeting inthe wake of the OPEC-wide cuts of 415,000 barrels a day thathave taken place in the past few days.   Celestino Armas, the oil minister of Venezuela, toldreporters in Caracas late Tuesday that prices would beginrecovering by today at the latest. Wednesday, in Jakarta,Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the Indonesian oil minister, said thecutbacks should at least curb the recent declines. &quot;We wantto show that OPEC will not allow the oil price to continue tofall,&quot; he said.   Nine of OPEC's 13 members, including Saudi Arabia, haveannounced cuts. Excluded are the two smallest members,Ecuador and Gabon, and two countries still sidelined by the1990-1991 Persian Gulf crisis, Kuwait and Iraq. But theindividual cuts are modest, ranging from 20,000 to 100,000barrels a day, and it is believed some oil is counted thatcan't be sold at the moment anyway.   Also, the reductions total less than 2% of OPEC's recentoutput of 24.2 million barrels a day. Most oil analysts andtraders insist the cuts will have to be far deeper if OPEC isto balance supplies with second-quarter demand for its oil.Still, some oil analysts suggest that the temporary cutsshould be enough to put a floor under falling oil prices andperhaps even trigger a recovery.   William H. Brown III, international oil analyst at Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co., said he still holds to earlier estimates thatprices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude,will average $20 to $21 a barrel this year. &quot;Prior to theOPEC meeting, we may see $18.50 as a bottom, but I expectgradual improvement,&quot; he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prospects of additional foreigndemand, coupled with generally tight stocks of U.S. wheat,pushed wheat futures prices higher. Traders expect Egypt toplace orders soon for the remaining 600,000 tons of wheatallotted to it under existing export credits granted by theU.S. Agriculture Department. In addition, Exportkelb -- theimport-export agent for the Commonwealth of IndependentStates -- has been actively booking freight, some of whichmay be used for shipping of U.S. wheat. And Jordan andPakistan have indicated their intention to buy foreign wheat.This, while not directly related to demand for U.S. wheat,nevertheless has the effect of pushing global wheat futuresprices higher. At the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, thewheat contract for March delivery rose 3.25 cents to $4.2725a bushel.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices fell following a report by a tradehouse. Cocoa for March delivery ended $12 a ton lower at$1,190. At first glance, the report by Gill andamp; Duffus, adivision of London commodity merchants E.D. andamp; F. Man Ltd.,was bullish. The trade house raised its estimate of how muchproduction would fall short of consumption this season, to177,000 metric tons; it had forecast a shortage of 148,000tons in September. Consumption of cocoa is projected to riseto a record 2,390,000 tons in the season ending September1992 from 2,347,000 tons last year. Meanwhile, productionwill decline significantly, particularly in the Ivory Coast,Ghana and Nigeria, the report said. &quot;The developing `El Nino'weather pattern may pose a threat to crops throughout thecocoa growing areas of the world,&quot; the report said. &quot;Themarket faces a sequence of deficits,&quot; Gill andamp; Duffuspredicted, and, as a result, &quot;the general trend of beanprices will be up rather than down.&quot; Prices fell yesterday,however, because the report also raised last season'sincrease in world stocks by even more than it raised thisseason's projected deficit, said Arthur Stevenson, an analystat Prudential Securities. That change caused disappointedtraders to liquidate their long positions, or bets the pricewill rise, by selling offsetting contracts. The news alsocaused industry buying to dry up, he added.   SUGAR: Futures prices rallied. Sugar for March deliveryended 0.21 cent a pound higher at 8.62 cents. ArthurStevenson, an analyst at Prudential Securities, attributedthe activity to reports that Cuba had concluded an agreementwith Iran to sell 200,000 tons of sugar. Also contributing tothe rise was light buying by commodity funds based ontechnical factors, he said. Sugar has been trading in asideways pattern since August, he said, adding he expectsprices will remain in a range of 8.1 cents to 9.28 cents fora while.</TEXT></DOC>
