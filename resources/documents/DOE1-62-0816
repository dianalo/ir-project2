<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-0816 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposes to construct,operate, and maintain approximately 29.8 miles of new 230-kV transmissionline between Conrad and Shelby, Montana. The project also includes relocationof approximately 4.9 miles of the existing Havre-Shelby 115-kV transmissionline, construction of a new 230/115-kV substation (Shelby No. 2) andconstruction of approximately 2.6 miles of new 115-kV transmission lineto interconnect the proposed Shelby No. 2 and existing Shelby No. 1 substations.The project involves a total of approximately 36 miles of new transmissionline. The area is presently served by a single transmission loop consistingof 115-kV and 161-kV facilities. This system is in urgent need of improvementsto correct low voltages, overloaded facilities, and loss of service thathas been experienced and which will worsen as loads grow in the area.The proposed action would provide improved service to area loads andsystem reliability, contribute to energy conservation, and provide additionalflexibility for future expansion when and if it becomes necessary. Alternativesconsidered include no action, energy conservation, other generation sources,other transmission systems and technologies, and the proposed actionwith routing and design alternatives. Unavoidable adverse effects ofthe proposed action would be construction related impacts on land use,visual, and biological resources. 14 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
