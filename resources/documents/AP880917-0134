(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A highway construction site turned into afish grab when part of a bayou was drained, leaving a wide, muddyhole where men with nets, buckets and spears sloshed around afterfish.   But not for long: state wildlife and fisheries agents armed withticket books quickly put the brakes on the landlubber fishermenFriday.   ``The people who got citations were the ones in the wateractively chasing the fish,'' said Capt. Burton Wiley of thewildlife department. ``We didn't write up anyone who was picking updead fish off the bank. If they want to scavenge, that's theirbusiness.''   Agents ticketed only people who caught gamefish such as bass orperch from the water, letting them keep trash fish such as catfish,gar and buffalo fish, he said.   But men at the construction scene after the incident disputedWiley, saying the game wardens confiscated all of the fish,including catfish and buffalo fish. And, they said, nobody wasallowed to pick up any of the fish at the site.   ``I don't think it is right for us to have to pay a big fine forcatching fish that were going to die anyway,'' the Alexandria DailyTown Talk quoted an unidentified participant as saying. The minimumpenalty for violating state gamefish regulations is $25.   Wiley said the best thing for the contractor to have done withunharmed fish stranded in the pool have been to dump them into thebayou on the other side of the earthen dam.   Project engineer Raymond Boniol of the State Department ofTransportation and Development said he was not present when thetickets were issued and is not familiar with state laws governingtaking fish at a construciton site.   ``That's not in the plans and specifications we drew up for thisproject,'' he joked.</TEXT></DOC>
