When new Common Market legislation is passed the British Governmentmay lift the general ban. The key issues are summarized. The main advantagesof the process are in its use as a pasteurisation process which, at theupper limit of allowed dose, kills eg salmonella in poultry. The disadvantagesarise because recommended doses do not sterilise but leave food lookingwholesome because the spoilage organisms are killed off. Other issuesraised are worker safety, consumer safety, nutritional values, vitaminC and EEC legislation. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
