AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Korea has chosen the FA-18Hornet produced by McDonnell Douglas Corp. as its main jet fighter,a decision worth an estimated $4.4 billion to the U.S. defensecontractor.   The Hornet won out over another U.S. competitor, GeneralDynamics Corp.'s F-16 Falcon, after a lengthy contest.   The announcement Wednesday came as a surprise. Widespreadreports said the nod would go to the far less expensive F-16. SouthKorea already has dozens of F-16s. In the early 1980's, itpurchased 36 of them.   McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, said in a statementreleased in Seoul, ``The Korean decision reaffirms America'sworldwide leadership in the aerospace industry.''   It estimated the contract would mean more than 20 million manhours of labor for U.S. workers and $3 billion worth of exportsover the next eight years.   Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon told a news conference, ``We havechosen the FA-18s after considering all factors, including safety,national interest and operational advantage that can help us toeffectively cope with North Korea's fast developing aircapability.''   The announcement gave no price tag for the project, but industryofficials estimated it was worth at least $4.4 billion. They saidthe same number of Falcons would have cost $2.8 billion.   The deal calls for South Korea to buy or co-produce 120 FA-18sunder its fighter program from 1992-98. Korea plans to buy 12finished FA-18s, assemble 36 from U.S.-supplied kits, andco-produce 72 in Korean factories with the help of its U.S.contractor.   The Hornet is a single-seat twin-engine jet first produced in1978. It is used by 30 squadrons in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps,and 842 planes have been sold to Canada, Australia, Spain, Kuwaitand Switzerland.   Its standard combat arms include two heat-seeking Sidewindermissiles on the wingtips, two radar-guided advanced Sparrowmissiles on fuselage stations and an internally mounted 20mmmachine gun with 570 rounds of ammunition.   The cockpit is entirely digital, with three color monitors and anew navigational and radar system for night attacks.   Some civilian officials supported choosing the cheaper F-16 butthe air force preferred the FA-18s, which it believes cantechnically match North Korea's newly introduced Soviet-madeMIG-29s and Su-25s, government sources said, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Kim Ji-wook said McDonnellDouglas offered a better deal, including a promise toelectronically upgrade aging Phantom jet fighters now in operation.   Industry officials expressed hope the plane purchase would helpdevelop South Korea's civilian aerospace industry. SamsungAerospace Industries, an arm of the giant Samsung Group, will bethe main Korean contractor for the military deal, and companies inthe Daewoo and Hanjin groups will participate.   Under American law, the U.S. Congress will have 50 days toapprove or reject the sale from the time it is formally notified ofthe agreement.   The U.S. government, under congressional pressure, had askedSouth Korea to purchase more finished aircraft to help reduce SouthKorea's trade surplus with the United States, expected to reach$4.5 billion in 1989.   South Korea, bowing to U.S. pressure, also had to lower from 50percent to 30 percent the portion of the so-called off-set program,under which the U.S. contractor would buy Korean-made aircraftparts in return for selling the American aircraft.   Some U.S. legislators expressed concern over technology transferto a nation which can develop its own aviation industry to competewith American firms.   McDonnell Douglas officials in Seoul said South Korean air forcepeople visited the United States twice this year to try out theairplane, once for six weeks. The company shipped more than a tonof paper evaluations on the plane to Seoul in September.   They said delivery of the first planes will depend on howquickly Congress approves the contract.   The FA-18 was approved for overseas sales 3{ years ago and isthe top U.S. military plane that can be offered for sale to foreignnations.</TEXT></DOC>
