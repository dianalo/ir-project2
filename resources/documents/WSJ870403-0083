But after the intervention and disclaimer, the dollar was still off sharply against most major currencies.    The British pound also strengthened after Britain's finance minister denied comments attributed to him Wednesday identifying exchange-rate targets for the currency.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8139 West German marks, down 0.9% from 1.8305 a day earlier. The pound surged 1% to $1.6070 from $1.5915.    The dollar fell 0.5% to 146.44 Japanese yen from 147.17. In early Tokyo trading Friday, it was quoted at 145.82 yen.    The currency was trading marginally below Wednesday's levels when U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter told a Senate panel that a further decline in its value would help cut the U.S. trade deficit. Shortly after his remark appeared on news wires, the dollar tumbled to intraday lows of 1.8108 marks and 146.25 yen.    Later, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Yeutter's remarks &quot;do not reflect the president's position&quot; and said the trade envoy was commenting on a hypothetical situation.    Mr. Yeutter was responding to a question from Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. Sen. Bradley was questioning the U.S.'s actions in supporting the dollar by market intervention in recent days and asked, &quot;Wouldn't our trade performance improve if the dollar dropped further?&quot;    Mr. Yeutter said it is &quot;essentially a mathematical truism&quot; that a lower dollar would lead to an improved U.S. trade balance.    In London, meanwhile, despite Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's denial that he had disclosed target rates for the pound Wednesday, data from Britain's Treasury showed that the Bank of England intervened heavily in the foreign-exchange market in March. Traders said they believe the action was designed to keep the pound within bounds that were set at a six-nation Paris meeting Feb. 22.    The Treasury said Britain's official gold and currency reserves rose by an &quot;underlying&quot; $1.78 billion last month, their biggest monthly rise since October 1977.    The Treasury said Britain's reserves now are valued at $27 billion.    Economists said the figures showed that the Bank of England was buying foreign currencies to prevent the pound from rising too far.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for April delivery was unchanged at $418 in brisk trading estimated at 4.5 million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, April 2, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
