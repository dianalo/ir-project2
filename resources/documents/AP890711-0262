Meanwhile, a survey of public opinion polls by the BritishBroadcasting Corp. showed Mrs. Thatcher trailing in popularity forthe first time.   Late Tuesday, the first direct negotiations since May betweenstate-run British Rail and unions broke down when unionrepresentatives walked out after the two sides failed to agree on apay raise.   Speaking to Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher condemned the city hallwalkouts.   ``Once again it is some of the extreme left wing in the tradeunions who never think of serving the public or of their duty to thepublic,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.   The prime minister spoke hours after the BBC's Poll of Pollsreported Neil Kinnock's Labor Party had a 10-point lead over Mrs.Thatcher's governing Conservative Party.   Commuters struggled to get home Tuesday as hundreds of trainswere canceled nationwide on the second day of a ban on overtime bythe train workers' union, the Associated Society of LocomotiveEngineers and Firemen.   Unions want a 10 percent pay raise, but British rail has offeredthem 7 percent. They say a major cause of this summer's labor unrestis an annual inflation rate of 8.3 percent _ the highest in sevenyears _ which has eaten into wages.   Rail workers also want British Rail to continue its national paybargaining, which the company has said will be replaced on Oct. 31with regional negotiations.   The National Union of Railwaymen said it would go ahead withWednesday's 24-hour strike, the fourth in as many weeks. Subwaytrain drivers were also to strike Wednesday in the 10th stoppagesince April 5th.   The Transport and General Workers Union said 96 percent of its9,400 dock workers stayed away on the first day of an indefinitestrike for job guarantees at 60 ports nationwide. But the NationalAssociation of Port Employers said the dock workers were split, with18 of the 60 ports operating normally.   A 48-hour pay strike by the National Association of LocalGovernment Workers, the second in two weeks, closed libraries, daycare centers for the handicapped and mentally ill, museums,municipal colleges, and local inspection and tax offices.   The union said 90 percent of its nearly half a million memberswere out, paralyzing city halls. The union threatened a three-daystrike next week.</TEXT></DOC>
