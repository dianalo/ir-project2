Nearly 3 million East Germans crossed into West Berlin and WestGermany between Friday and Sunday, the second weekend since thegovernment opened borders to the West, border police said. Mostwere just visiting for the day.   Ferry service across the Elbe River, which forms part of theborder, resumed Sunday at Hitzacker, about 80 miles southeast ofHamburg, for the first time since April 23, 1945.   In other changes, the official ADN news agency reported that theroles of the party and the government in East Germany's armedforces will be separated.   Also Sunday, an opposition leader said his pro-democracy groupwould hold a convention next month to establish itself as a formalpolitical party.   Wolfgang Schnur, in an interview with West Germany's ARDtelevision network, said his Democratic Awakening opposition groupwill meet Dec. 16-17 _ the same time the Communist Party will beholding a special session in East Berlin to look at furtherleadership changes.   Communist chief Egon Krenz assured East Germans in a televisedinterview late Sunday that he will fight for political reform. ``Ifthe party is of another opinion, then they should find anothergeneral secretary,'' he said at his East Berlin home.   ADN said 50,000 people participated in Dresden's firstofficially authorized protest rally. Other estimates of the crowdsize ranged up to 100,000.   ``Lord don't forgive them because they knew what they did,''said one banner in the southern city, making a biting play on wordsfrom Jesus Christ's agony on the cross.   In East Berlin, thousands participated in an unauthorized marchfrom the Alexanderplatz square to Parliament, calling for sweepingreforms and abolition of the Communist Party's guaranteed monopolyon power.   Parliament on Saturday confirmed a reform-minded Cabinet ofCommunist Premier Hans Modrow and created a committee to studypossible constitutional changes, including dropping a lawguaranteeing Communist rule.   ``We won't let ourselves be blinded by the open borders,'' saidone protest banner. ``Swap DDR (East Germany) for Mickey Mouse,''said another.   One sign suggested, ``Honecker to court,'' and speakers calledfor prosecution of the country's former leaders, including oustedpresident and party chief Erich Honecker, who was replaced by KrenzOct. 18.   Krenz was quoted by a West German newspaper as saying Honeckeris one of those under investigation by a parliamentary commission.   Just outside the capital, about 30,000 Communist Party backersdemonstrated in Potsdam to show their support for the government'sannounced reform program, ADN said.   ADN reported other pro-democracy rallies Sunday in a half-dozencities and towns: 20,000 people in Erfurt, 10,000 in Meiningen,also 10,000 in Frankfurt an der Oder, 3,000 in Schwedt and 2,000 inNeustrelitz. The official agency said ``thousands'' protested inKarl Marx Stadt but did not give a more precise crowd estimate forthe march there or in East Berlin.   At least some demonstrators were cool to the idea of unifyingthe two Germanys, a subject of much debate since East Germanborders opened Nov. 9.   ``Reunification now _ No Thanks,'' read one of the banners atthe Dresden march. ``We are not on the Reeperbahn where you can buya union for money,'' it added, referring to the famous red-lightdistrict in Hamburg, West Germany.   The demonstrators marched a two-mile route to a rally atDresden's Theater Square.   Joining the marchers on the sidewalk was Andreas Leber, a40-year-old Lutheran pastor at the cathedral in nearby Meissen.   With one hand he held a pram carrying his baby son and with theother a cardboard sign saying ``Our people need the Communist Partylike a fish needs a bicycle.'' He drew much laughter.   ``Meissen was left intact in World War II,'' he told a reporter.``But 40 years of socialism has left one third of the cityderelict.''   In another reform measure, ADN said Sunday that the roles of theCommunist Party and the government in running the army ``will beclearly separated from now on.''   The Political Directorate of the 173,000-strong NationalPeople's Army proposed that guidelines setting out the party's gripon the army be suspended and that ``secretariats of the politicalorgans'' in the army command be dissolved, ADN said.   The dispatch gave no further details, but it appeared clear EastGermany is following a Soviet lead in moves toward aless-politicized army.</TEXT></DOC>
