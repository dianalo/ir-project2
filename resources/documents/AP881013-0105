(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patrick J. Kennedy, the son of Sen.Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, spent $66 for every vote hereceived in his successful bid for a state House seat, campaignfinance reports show.   Kennedy spent $87,694 to unseat five-term Rep. John M.Skeffington Jr. in last month's Democratic primary. All but $5,904of that sum came from him or his family, according to the reportfiled Wednesday with the state Board of Elections.   Skeffington has not yet filed his report. Robert Doorley,Skeffington's campaign chairman, said the incumbent spent between$38,000 and $40,000.   Kennedy, 21, received 1,324 votes to 1,009 for Skeffington inthe district on the west side of Providence. He does not have aRepublican opponent in November.   Kennedy's pay as a state representative will be $5 perlegislative day, up to a maximum of $300.   ``All of our money is there and it's all out in the open,''Kennedy said. ``I make no secret of the fact that I have been givena lot. I hope I can be a force for good at the Statehouse.''   Kennedy said the big spending was necessary to counterSkeffington's support from Democratic Party leaders and alast-minute advertising campaign supporting Skeffington that waspaid for by the National Rifle Association.   He said $15,000 of the sum went to lawyers who pursuedchallenges to the registrations of about 170 voters.</TEXT></DOC>
