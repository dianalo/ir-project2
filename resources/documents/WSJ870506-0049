The increase in the reserves, which are made up mainly of gold and convertible foreign currencies, indicated that the Bank of England was a heavy seller of the pound on foreign-exchange markets last month as it tried to curb the British currency's strength. Toward that goal, the government is expected to further ease interest rates. Another reduction is expected before the British national election, which could be held as early as next month.    The monthly jump in reserves, the second highest ever, exceeded market forecasts of about a $2 billion increase and March's underlying gain of $1.79 billion. The record monthly increase was $3.04 billion in October 1977. The underlying figure takes into account official repayments and new borrowings.    Economists in the City, London's financial district, view the underlying figures as a fairly accurate indicator of the central bank's activity on currency markets. The British Treasury said that changes in the reserves don't necessarily reflect the Bank of England's level of intervention.    The central bank yesterday resisted pressure for an immediate cut in the base rate, which is the benchmark for commercial bank lending in Britain. It did so despite a fall in money-market interest rates and a rise in the pound to well above the point at which British authorities encouraged last week's half-percentage-point cut in the base rate from 10%.    In response to the reserves figure, dealers said, the key three-month money-market rate fell below 9%. And the pound's trade-weighted value was 73.5% of its 1975 level at the close of London trading yesterday, contrasted with 73.1% immediately before the April 28 base-rate cut.    Sterling began its recent climb in mid-February. Since then, the Bank of England and the Treasury have used a variety of instruments to control its rise. While sterling has still advanced, its gains have been less than the markets would have dictated without any intervention. Similarly, banks' base rates have come down 1.5 percentage points since early March. The drops occurred in half-percentage point stages and at times that caught the markets unaware.    Last month's sharp rise in underlying reserves suggests that the heavy flow of foreign funds into London lately and the pound's subsequent strength have become a mixed blessing for Britain. The Bank of England, often forced to control the pound's declines in recent years, now must weigh the possible risks of trying to prevent its rise.    The central bank's intervention last month and in March mainly grew out of fears that British industry could lose the competitiveness achieved late last year, when sterling slumped against most currencies, in particular the West German mark. British industry's gains have generated optimism among manufacturers and brought their flow of orders to a ten-year high.    But unchecked, the sale of pounds for foreign currencies could dangerously inflate Britain's domestic money supply. This hasn't happened so far because the central bank has &quot;sterilized&quot; its intervention by selling government gilt-edged securities to absorb the cash issued through its currency intervention. City economists believe there may be limits to the government's capacity to continue this operation. But Treasury officials yesterday insisted there aren't any problems.    British authorities also face worries in stemming the incoming flow of foreign currencies through lower interest rates, another traditional tactic. Continuing strong growth in the money supply, combined with rising personal indebtedness, represent a &quot;glacier&quot; of liquidity in the British economy, the Bank of England previously has warned.    The central bank's economists argue that an overly rapid fall in interest rates could cause this glacier to melt. They foresee serious inflationary consequences for a country where prices already are climbing faster than in key competitor nations. </TEXT></DOC>
