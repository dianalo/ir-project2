The same daily newspaper said Tuesday that the release of Iranianassets would not guarantee Iranian help in freeing Western hostagesheld by pro-Iranian groups.   In an editorial today, the Kayhan International newspaper saidPresident Bush has shown ``substantial restraint'' on the hostageissue but that is not enough to improve ties between the nations.   The editorial, reported by the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency, echoed a statement Monday by an Iranian leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei, that there is no chance for talks between U.S. andIranian leaders.   The United States ``can demonstrate its wisdom, farsightednessand pragmatic approach just by taking two simple actions: 1. CondemnIsrael for its acts of terrorism, and 2. Release Iranian assets,''Kayhan said.   Billions of dollars in Iranian assets, mostly undeliveredmilitary equipment, were frozen in the United States after Iranianextremists seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52Americans hostage. The hostages were held 444 days.   There are 16 Westerners, including eight Americans, held hostagein Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions.   Bush said Tuesday the Iranians have it in their power to getAmerican hostages released and rejoin the ``family of law abiding''nations. But he has said there can be no link between unfreezingIranian assets and releasing the hostages.   Kayhan said Tuesday that for Bush to ``pin hopes on Iran'sassistance'' to free the hostages ``without respecting Tehran'sconditions is wishful thinking.'' It said the release of Iranianassets in the United States would ``be taken only as a goodwillgesture,'' not as a trade-off for help in freeing the hostages.   The plight of the U.S. hostages was pushed to the fore afterIsraeli commandos July 28 kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aShiite Moslem cleric from south Lebanon. Israel said it wanted totrade him for the Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers heldin Lebanon.   In response, a group called the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth claimed it had hanged an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins. Another pro-Iranian group threatened to killanother American hostage but later suspended the threat.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   In another development today, the 17-year-old nephew of jailedBritish businessman Roger Cooper offered to take his place if Iranwould allow Cooper to return to Britain for his mother's funeral.   Cooper, 53, has been held in Tehran on spy charges for nearlyfour years, and his family and the British government have appealedto Iran to let him attend the funeral on Saturday.   Simon Cooper, son of Roger Cooper's brother Paul Cooper, offeredto go to Iran as collateral for his uncle.</TEXT></DOC>
