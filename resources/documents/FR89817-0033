Recently, theBoard has implemented the requirement by means of an agreement betweenthe Board and the acquiror. Previously, the Board implemented the requirementby means of a stipulation signed by the acquiror. When the capital maintenancerequirement was first conceived, the Board included as a condition of approvalthe requirement that the acquiror maintain the insured institution's capitalat or above the required level. In all cases, the acquiror consummatedthe acquisition with full knowledge of the obligation imposed by the conditionsof approval specified by the Board.The exact terms of the capital maintenance responsibility also have changedover time. Until August 1988, acquirors generally were subject to an obligationthat was not limited in amount and that remained in existence for as longas the acquiror controlled the insured institution. However, reflectingthe Board's most recent policy statement on the subject of capital maintenance,\4\<NOTE/> and the guidelines implemented by the Office of RegulatoryActivities implementing the policy statement,\5\<NOTE/> the capital maintenance agreements currently imposed by theBoard are limited as to potential liability and have a duration of tenyears.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\<T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\<T3>See Net Worth Maintenance and Prenuptial Agreements,</T3> Office ofRegulatory Activities, Thrift Bulletin TB-5, October 19, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\The policy statement as implemented by the guidelines providesthat acquirors of insured institutions meeting their fully phased-out capitalrequirement (as defined in 12 CFR 563.13) upon completion of the acquisitionwould not be required to enter into such an agreement. In addition, inmany cases, acquirors would have the option of entering into a ``prenuptialagreement.'' A ``prenuptial agreement'' does not by its terms require theinfusion of capital into an institution. However, in the event the insuredinstitution's regulatory capital declines below a specified level, theprenuptial agreement grants an officer of the Board the right to vote thesecurities of the institution held by the acquiror respecting certain actions,to remove and replace the board of directors of the institution, or todispose of any or all of the securities of the institution owned by theacquiror. The proposed regulation does not impose any limitation on divestitureby an acquiror that is subject to a prenuptial agreement.It has been the Board's experience that acquirors that are subject to acapital maintenance obligation may attempt various strategies to avoidsuch an obligation. Such attempts may occur, for example, where an acquirorsees the institution facing increased capital requirements and/or a deterioratingfinancial condition and seeks to avoid its obligations by divesting controlof the institution. The problem is particularly acute where the divestitureis to a widely dispersed group of new owners, none of which would be deemedto control the divested institution and, accordingly, none of which wouldbe subject to a new net worth maintenance obligation. Although divestituredoes not absolve an acquiror from the responsibility of curing capitaldeficiencies that occurred while the acquiror controlled the institution(even where the acquiror divests to a new acquiror, who enters into a newcapital maintenance obligation), divestiture has, on occasion, raised practicalproblems with regard to enforcing an agreement.The Board has consistently believed that acquirors that control the practicesof their insured subsidiaries and enjoy the benefits of such control, includingFSLIC insurance of accounts, should support such institutions during periodsof financial weakness or instability.\7\<NOTE/> The obligation to maintain the institution's capital duringsuch periods increases an acquiror's incentive to manage the institutionprudently. In addition, such support promotes the continued viability ofthe institution, and helps maintain a safe and sound financial system andpromote depositor confidence. Regardless of the form they have taken, capitalmaintenance obligations have been explicit, and their existence has beenclearly evident to acquirors prior to the time that an acquisition wasconsummated. Thus, acquirors that are subject to capital maintenance obligationtoday assumed that position voluntarily, with full knowledge of the obligationthey assumed to support the financial condition of the institution theycontrolled, when they acquired savings institutions and sought to enjoythe benefits of such ownership.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See, e.g, </T3>the Policy Statement, at 53 FR 31761 (August 19, 1988).The Board, therefore, does not intend to tolerate efforts to avoid capitalmaintenance obligations, particularly because attempts to avoid such obligations,when they occur, usually occur when an institution is most in need of thesupport that the Board has sought to ensure by imposing the obligation.Accordingly, pursuant to authority under 12 U.S.C. 1437(a), 1725(a), 1730(m)(3),and 1730a(h)(1), the Board proposes to adopt a regulation that would requireany acquiror that is subject to a capital maintenance obligation to giveprior written notice to the Board of the proposed divestiture of the insuredinstitution to which the obligation relates.\8\<NOTE/> In the Board's view, the proposed rule would (and is intendedto) contribute to the safety and soundness of insured institutions, helpto preserve the federal deposit insurance fund for insured savings institutions,and further the Board's goal of ensuring that acquirors of insured institutionsserve as a source of strength to their subsidiary institutions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ This obligation would be separate from any applicationto be released from registration as a savings and loan holding companyunder 12 U.S.C. 1730a(b)(6) and 12 CFR 584.1(d).Under the proposal, the party giving notice could proceed with the proposeddivestiture when either (i) the acquiror provides the Board with an agreementto infuse into the institution the amount necessary to fulfill the acquiror'scapital maintenance obligation (calculated on a ``snapshot'' basis) andmakes satisfactory arrangements to assure payment of the amount owed, <T3>e.g.</T3>, by establishing an escrow administered by an acceptableescrow agent; or (ii) the extent of the obligation is ascertained and theobligation is satisfied prior to divestiture.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ When an acquiror is subject to a <T3>pro rata</T3> capital maintenance obligation (for example, when theacquiror has acquired a minority interest in the institution and the Boardhas permitted the acquiror's obligation to be <T3>pro rata</T3>), the level at which the acquiror would be required tomaintain the capital would be the level the capital of the institutionwould reach if the acquiror contributed the <T3>pro rata</T3> contribution.The proposal provides that the Board would have 120 days during which toconduct either a full or limited purpose examination (as deemed appropriateby the Supervisory Agent) of the insured institution to detemine the extentof any capital deficiency.\10\<NOTE/> If an examination is not completed within 120 days afterthe Board received notice of the divestiture, the accounting informationset forth in the institution's most recent thrift financial report wouldbe used in computing any deficiency. However, if the failure to completean examination within 120 days is caused by lack of cooperation from theacquiror, the 120 days period would be extended.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Of course, if the Board determines at a later time thatfraud or misrepresentations occurred during the course of the examination,the Board may seek appropriate enforcement remedies.The proposed regulation does not impose any additional liability underexisting capital maintenance obligations.\11\<NOTE/> Instead, the proposal recognizes that acquirors are obligatedto maintain the capital of an institution above certain levels at all timesand is designed to ensure that any appropriate amounts are infused intothe institution, even where, for example, the accounting records of aninstitution at the time of a proposed divestiture, for whatever reason,do not reflect deterioration in the quality of an asset. In this regard,the notice of divestiture, as proposed, would require the acquiror to informthe Board of any adverse financial developments affecting the institution.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ In addition to providing that termination of the agreementshall not preclude the exercise by the Board of any right or remedy arisingfrom a default under the agreement that occurred or existed prior to terminationof the agreement, the current form of regulatory capital maintenance agreementprovides that termination of the agreement shall not preclude the Boardfrom exercising any right or remedy under the agreement arising from aregulatory capital deficiency occurring within one year following terminationof the agreement. The proposed regulation includes a provision that clarifiesthat the term of the regulation do not automatically supersede any provisionsof existing regulatory capital maintenance agreements; however, terminationof such agreements could be negotiated on a case by case basis in conjunctionwith a divestiture accomplished in accordance with the proposed rule.The Board is concerned, however, that a one-time payment to remedy anycapital deficiency that is present at that time does not provide the sameprotection to the FSLIC as had the continuing obligation to infuse capitalwhenever a capital deficiency appears. This concern is especially presentwhere an institution has deteriorating asset quality, which is not fullyreflected by accounting records which are primarily based upon historicalcosts. Accordingly, although not part of the current proposal, the Boardis considering, and specifically requests commenters to address, whetheran additional payment mechanism to address the foregoing concerns shouldbe added to the proposal. Such a mechanism could provide that the Boardcould determine that an institution's records do not accurately or adequatelyreflect the institution's financial condition as a result of factors suchas poor asset quality, higher risk operations, poor underwriting practicesor ongoing operational losses. In such a case, the Board could requirethat the acquiror establish an acceptable escrow arrangement for fundsthat would be used to cover the institution's anticipated capital deficiencyfor a specified period, <T3>e.g., </T3>two years, after the date of the acquiror's divestitureof control of the institution.In order to provide flexibility, the proposed regulation permits the SupervisoryAgent to grant or deny exemptions from the regulation, after consultingwith the Office of Regulatory Activities and the Office of General Counsel.The use of such exemptive authority may be appropriate where, for example,the acquiror proposes to sell the institution to a new acquiror, whichwould restore the institution's capital to the appropriate level in connectionwith the acquisition, where the Supervisory Agent, for supervisory reasons,desires prompt divestiture.The proposed regulation does not impose any limitation on divestiture byan acquiror that is subject to a prenuptial agreement.\12\<NOTE/> However, there would appear to be a reasonable basis forimposing a similar requirement in the context of prenuptial agreements,given that if an institution's capital is below the level that triggersthe Board's rights under the agreement, the Board may desire to pursuesuch rights.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Prenuptial agreements are described in footnote 6, <T3>supra.</T3>The Board requests comment on suitable approaches to use to make sure thatacquirors that have entered into prenuptial agreements do not avoid theterms of such agreements. In particular, the Board requests comment onwhether the Board should provide that the Board's rights under a prenuptialagreement would survive any transfer of the shares held by the acquiror.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Similarly, the Board requests comment on whether theobjectives of the proposed regulation concerning capital maintenance agreementscould be met by providing that an institution's stock divested by an acquirorsubject to a capital maintenance agreement would carry with it a <T3>pro rata </T3>obligation to maintain the capital of the institution.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the proposed rules.</T3>These elements have been discussed elsewhere in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION </T2>regarding the proposal.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rules would apply</T3>. The rulewould apply to all persons or companies that are subject to a capital maintenanceobligation. 3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rules on small institutions</T3>. The rule willaffect all persons and companies who are subject to capital maintenanceobligations equally and will not have an adverse impact on small institutions.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules</T3>. There are no known federalrules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule. 5. <T3>Alternatives to the proposed rule</T3>. There are no alternatives thatwould be less burdensome and yet effectively accomplish the objectivesof the proposed rule than the proposal in addressing the concerns expressedin the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> set forth above. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 563 </ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations.
