The Food and DrugAdministration has regulated the devices since 1976. Asrecently as November, an FDA advisory committee, thoughasking for further study, recommended that the implantsremain on the market. Yet on Tuesday, FDA Commissioner DavidKessler killed the product.   Dr. Kessler of course dissembled, professing that hedidn't do it. He did not say the product was unsafe, butmerely listed a long list of things science does not knowwith 100% certainty (and in our lifetimes never will). Heclaimed he only wanted a 45-day moratorium on the implants,in order to reconvene the committee to study new information.But surely he is not fool enough to believe that hisannouncement leaves any chance the product will ever beavailable again. In the future even women who fullyunderstand the alleged risk will not be able to get siliconeimplants, except of course by visiting the Caribbean, wheredoctors have been stockpiling the implant materials inanticipation of an inevitable FDA decision.</LP><TEXT>   The new datum is that the contingency-fee lawyers finallywon one. At this point David Kessler, J.D., M.D., suspendedthe apparatus of science and invoked the apparatus of thecourtroom. Peer review and randomized studies, we see soclearly, can easily be trumped by discovery and theadversarial process.   The handwriting has been on the wall since 1988, when theRalph Nader empire, via Sidney Wolfe's Public Citizen HealthResearch Group, started to lobby for prohibition of theimplants. In between calls for full disclosure, the Naderfolks steadfastly refuse to reveal their own financing. We doknow that the Health Research Group has prepared how-to kitson suing implant manufacturers; plaintiff lawyers pay thegroup $750 per kit. The Naderites also unfailingly show up attort-bar conventions, and on the historic record serve as atort-bar advance party and cheering section. The business ofthe contingency-fee lawyers, of course, is speculating inlitigation, hoping to hit deep pockets with big awards, ofwhich they pocket a third or more. So by now the plaintiffbartrade group, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, hasset up a Breast Implant Litigation Group.   After a few years' stalking, the BILG bagged a jury inCalifornia in December. Court reports don't disclose suchdetails, but assuming lawyer Dan Bolton operated on a typicalcontingency-fee arrangement, he won his San Francisco firm ofRopers, Majewski, Kohn, Bentley, Wagner andamp; Kane some $2.43million from Dow Corning Wright, a leading implantmanufacturer. The rest of the jury's $7.3 million judgment,less some or another charge for expenses, would go to theclient, who complained of an autoimmune disease. Her owndoctors determined she suffered from the symptoms before shereceived the implants. The tort-bar industry relies on thelaws of probability; some jury somewhere will sooner or laterorder compensation for a sympathetic plaintiff.   The &quot;evidence&quot; from the trial was of course not adouble-blind study but the product of &quot;discovery,&quot; plowingthrough shelves of company records to find a fewincriminating-sounding sentence fragments. As there will be asympathetic jury, somewhere there will be an internalmemorandum between company officials on the need to studysome possible side effect. And inevitably something will nothave been &quot;disclosed,&quot; even though for years Dow Corningroutinely passed along all studies, including raw data, toFDA scientists.   Whether the California verdict will survive on appeal islargely academic. Dr. Kessler has licensed bounty-hunting onsilicone implants. Contingency-fee lawyers will quicklygather the names of plaintiffs for class-action lawsuits.These lawyers take no risk even when they bring meritlesscases because of the uniquely American system that the losingside of a lawsuit has no duty to pay the legal costs of thewinner. This means silicone implants will join a long list ofproducts litigated off the U.S. market when manufacturersdecide that their profit margins are swamped by the costs ofdefending lawsuits.   Part of the anti-implant movement was a feminist agenda.Scarsdale psychologist Rita Freedman, a member of Dr.Kessler's advisory committee, wrote to him that breastreconstructions &quot;perpetuate the myth of the Barbie Dollbody.&quot; But of course the patients who request the implants,and the many who are totally satisfied with them, are not menbut women. Indeed, since women and their children makesympathetic clients, the tort bar likes to target productsthey use. So lawsuits have swept the market not only ofproblem-ridden types of interuterine birth-control devices,but also of G.D. Searle's scientifically innocent Copper-7.And despite the lack of any scientific evidence of risk,pregnant women can no longer take Merrill-Dow's Bendectin formorning sickness; they get to chew crackers instead.   Maybe the only recourse is for companies and affectedwomen to counterattack by taking to the courts themselves.Attorney Kessler must understand that in legal parlance hehas no &quot;rational basis&quot; for banning a product that has beenon the market for decades. And the Naderites and the tortlawyers' &quot;litigation groups&quot; sure look like a conspiracy tous. Meanwhile, there's a new book, Peter Huber's &quot;Galileo'sRevenge,&quot; on how junk science prevails in courtrooms.   Dan Hayes, the president of the Dow Corning subsidiary,wonders what hit him. &quot;We strongly encourage the FDA in thisevaluation process to bring science back into this decision,&quot;he said. &quot;We insist that the FDA rely on experts withappropriate credentials.&quot; But of course spokesmen for amanufacturer cannot be believed; they're in it for theprofit. Who are they to dispute those untainted and impartialprotectors of innocent women and children, Nader and TortLawyers Inc.?</TEXT></DOC>
