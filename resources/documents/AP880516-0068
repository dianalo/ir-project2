In the coastal city of Tel Aviv, temperatures reached 114degrees Sunday and were expected to reached 116 today.   A 55-year-old Austrian tourist, Hubert Riegler of Vienna, diedSaturday after suffering heat stroke when he went on a hike in theDead Sea area south of Jerusalem, police said.   The record temperatures were caused by a ``sharav,'' or hotdesert wind, which arrives from North Africa, said Marco Marcel, aweather forecaster at the Israel Meteorological Service.   The three-day heat wave was the worst since May 1970, whentemperatures reached 115 degrees, Marcel said.   A 35-year-old Israeli died in Ramat Hasharon, a suburb of TelAviv, when he tried to light an electric generator during a poweroutage caused by record consumption of electricity. He burned todeath when the generator burst into flames, police said.   Health officials advised people to stay indoors as much aspossible and drink 12 to 16 glasses of water a day.   In the northern Galilee, firefighters were battling 50 firestoday that had burned for over 24 hours, Israel radio said. Smallplanes were used to spray water on the flames. Another 50 blazeshave been extinquished.   Flames that started in thorn fields near the Ein Gev kibbutz, orcommunal farm, spread to uncleared mine fields left over from war,said Danny Hanania, fire chief for the Galilee and Golan Heightsregion. Hanania said.   Fires also burned down six homes in the Mitzpe Kelil settlement,destroying an estimated 350 acres of trees and caused at least$500,000 damage, Israeli radio and news reports said.   A small village in the Galilee, Moshav Ya'ara, population 350,was evacuated because of fire, the radio said.   The Meteorological Service issued warnings to farmers raisingchickens, which are especially sensitive to high temperatures.   ``The poor chickens suffer terribly in this heat and must becooled down as much as possible,'' Marcel said.</TEXT></DOC>
