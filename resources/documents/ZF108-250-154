(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Translating GraphicsandM;Anyone who has ever taken graphics created by one software package and triedto mesh them with the output of another program will recognize the awful ringof truth in Bullwinkle's remark.andP;  While more and more programs are now ableto mainipulate or output graphic images, very few offer much more than takensupport for graphics from outside sources.andM;Fortunately, Inset Systems' HiJaak can act as an electronic import-exportoutfit, making it possible to switch graphic images between all sorts ofotherwise incompatible programs.andM;You need HiJaak for a simple reason: today's programs use dozens ofincompatible formats to store bitmapped graphics files.andP;  These formats allserve pretty much the same purpose, but they go about it in vastly differentways.andP;  Why this file format Tower or Babel?andP;  Because in the absence of agraphics format dominant enough to be called a standard, programmers have anunfortunate tendency to create new ones with great regularity.andM;Lotus 1-2-3, for instance, stores its charts in a file format known as PIC.andO;PC Paintbrush uses one called PCX, while Microsoft Windows Paint uses the MSPformat.andP;  GEM-based programs use the IMG format, and WordPerfect uses WPG.andO;Although most information services and bulletin boards use CompuServe's GIFformat, scanners generally use one or more flavors of the TIFF format.andP;  Faxboards tend to use proprietary formats for storing graphics files.andP;  (For moreinformation on graphics formats, see Technobabble in this issue's Helpsection.)andM;This situation isn't unique to graphics files, of course.andP;  Most wordprocessors also store their files in different formats, so you can't read aWordPerfect file in WordStar, for example, without translating it.andM;Given this diversity, it's understandable that most makers of wordprocessing, desktop publishing, and database programs don't have the time orinclination to provide support for every graphics file format from whichtheir users might wish to import images.andP;  But that doesn't make it any lessinfuriating.andM;This problem affects any PC user who wants to import a 1-2-3 bar chart or ascanned photograph into a word processing document.andP;  It seems like a simplerequest, and many word processors do claim to print graphics.andP;  But when youtry it, you're likely to discover that your package can't read the graphicsformats you need.andM;I'm Taking This Fiule to CubaandM;Luckily, you can HiJaak the files you need from just about any format.andO;Initially conceived as an adjunct to Inset--a utility that integrates graphicimages in the printed output of programs that normally output onlytext--HiJaak instead took on a life of its own.andP;  It functions simply andreliably as a universal translator of graphic image files, painlesslyconverting more than 20 formats.andP;  (For a complete list, see the sidebar&quot;Following the Formats.&quot;)  The utility also supports vector-to-vectorconversions between Hewlett-Packard Plotter (PGL), Hewlett-Packard Printer(PCL), and Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files.andP;  It even includes a varietyof routines that can convert ASCII text files into fancy typefaces forprinting on a LaserJet.andM;Let's Not Stop ThereandM;If you want to import an image from a program that uses a format HiJaak can'tconvert, the utility also includes a memory-resident routine that capturesthe current screen to disk in an Inset PIX file.andP;  To import it into yourapplication, simply capture the image and convert the resulting file into theformat you want.andP;  You can also use this feature to capture an entire screenof text or graphics (for use in an instruction manual, for instance).andM;Because HiJaak can work with files that have been &quot;printed to disk&quot; in PCL orPGL format, you can use it to import high-resolution graphics into desktoppublishing documents even if HiJaak doesn't read the original program'sstandard file format directory.andP;  If the original application doesn't supportprinting to disk, set HiJaak's Capture routine to intercept the program'soutput to the printer port and save it as a PCL or PGL file.andM;The decent manual includes instructions for generating PGL and PCL files froma variety of popular applications, including Harvard Graphics, LotusFreeLance, GEM Draw Plus, Auto-CAD, and Generic CADD, as well as tips forbuilding a clip-art library, enhancing graphic images, exchanging graphicsbetween a PC and a Mac, and building batch files to automate frequently usedconversions.andM;The Shell GameandM;The HiJaak conversion program and its capture utility (CAPTURE.EXE) both workfrom the DOS command line or from a simple-to-use shell program.andP;  To converta file called MOON.PCX into a TIFF format file, for instance, you couldsimply type CONVERT MOON.PCX MOON.TIF at the DOS prompt (assuming that bothMOON.PCX and CONVERT.EXE are in the current directory).andP;  You can also loadthe shell and simply fill in the blanks in the form it presents onscreen.andO;You tell it which file or files you wish to convert and which format you wantthem in.andP;  That's all there is to it.andM;The command-line approach is quicker and lets you use wildcards (such asCONVERT *.PCX *.TIF to convert all your PCX files to TIFF format).andP;  It's alsothe only way to build file conversion into batch files.andP;  Both approachesoffer a number of options for the destination file, including forcing a colorimage into black and white, inverting the colors in an image, and controllingthe resolution of conversions to the LaserJet's PCL format.andM;A perfect world would have no need for conversion utilities such as HiJaak.andO;File formats would be standardized and applications could easily transfergraphics files among themselves.andP;  But in this less-than-perfect world, we'relucky to have HiJaak.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
