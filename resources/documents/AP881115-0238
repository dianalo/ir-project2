Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are gathering in Vienna for their semi-annual meeting onNov. 21, which has taken on added importance because of a plunge inoil price as a result of over production.   Lukman, quoted in an interview with the daily Al-Watan newspaper,did not specify what the new production ceiling should be. But heexcluded a rise to as many as 22 million barrels a day.   Current OPEC output is estimated at just below that figure,because of overproduction by some cartel members.   OPEC's current production ceiling is 16.6 million barrels a day.This includes a quota of 1.5 million barrels for Iraq, whichrejected this figure when it was set in Dec. 1986 and is currentlyproducing almost double that amount.   Kuwait and its sister states in the Gulf Cooperation Council haveproposed that Iraq be given a quota equal to Iran's 2.3 millionbarrels per day, to raise the OPEC ceiling to at least 17.4 millionbarrels per day.   The other GCC states are Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oilproducer, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.   Lukman stressed in the interview that adherence by member statesto the production quotas was the best way to raise the price of oilabove the OPEC benchmark of $18 per barrel.   The current world oil glut has forced the price down to around$13 per barrel.   ``As the present OPEC agreement expires at the end of December,we have to reach a new accord in Vienna, but this time we aspire tosee the agreement signed by all 13 members,'' Lukman said.   He warned the agreement would collapse if it was violated byanyone. He explained that ``in the past some members managed to goon violating the agreement because other members stuck to theirquotas.   ``But if the coming agreement is violated by any member, allmembers will have to increase their production. Those violators arewell aware of this fact,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
