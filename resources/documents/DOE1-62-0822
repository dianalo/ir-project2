The data were collected froma single layer of stationary, narrowly size-classified samples of coaland graphite placed on a heated NaCl window. Sample temperatures rangedfrom 120 to 200{sup 0}C. FTIR data were collected at wavelengths between2.2 and 17 {mu}m (between 4500 and 580 cm/sup -1/). Particle sizes rangedfrom 40 to 120 {mu}m and coal rank ranged from lignite to bituminous.The focus of this work is to evaluate the effects of the nongray emissioncharacteristics of coal on heat transfer calculations and pyrometry measurements.Both diffuse and peaked regions of the spectral emissions are analyzedwith this goal in mind. Chemical functional groups responsible for thefeatures of the spectral emission are indicated but not discussed. Wellcharacterized spectral features from coal samples are observed and discussed.The intensity of spectral peaks due to chemical functional groups incoal are analyzed as a function of particle size and extent of reaction.The impact of spectral irregularities on pyrometry measurements and heattransfer calculations is evaluated. Featureless regions of the infraredemission spectra of coal are also analyzed and compared to graybody behavior.Reliability of pyrometry measurements in these regions and effectiveemissivities of coal particles for heat transfer calculations are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
