The United Democratic Front and the Mass Democratic Movement,two overlapping coalitions of opposition groups, said in a NewYear's message that government efforts at repression during the1980s had failed quell black resistance.   ``Despite a determined state assault on progressive people'sorganizations, the state of emergency (imposed in 1986) failedmiserably in its desire to submit us further to the will of theminority,'' the statement said.   It said 1990 would be a pivotal year, bringing the expectedrelease of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandelaand the possibility of negotiations on a post-apartheid politicalstructure.   ``What we will all be doing, from both government and liberationmovement sides, will determine whether South Africa goes throughthe path of a bloodbath or takes the high road of a less violenttransition to a non-racial and democratic South Africa,'' thestatement said. ``We enter the 1990s with the hope and confidencethat victory for democracy in our country is in sight.''   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., in a year-endcommentary Friday, said ``the face of South Africa has changeddramatically and irrevocably in the 1980s'' because of moves awayfrom racial discrimination and toward limited politicalpower-sharing.   ``Ahead lies the further broadening of democracy with theextension of the principle of power sharing at all levels ofgovernment to black South Africans,'' the commentary said. How toachieve that ``in a manner fair and equitable to all is thechallenge that awaits the leadership of all politicalconstituencies in the 1990s.''   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party, which won 20 percent of thevote in white parliamentary elections in September, commendedPresident F.W. de Klerk for his performance since the election.   The Democrats' three co-leaders praised de Klerk for freeingseveral prominent political prisoners, reducing the duration ofmandatory military service and abolishing segregated beaches. Butthey said de Klerk and his National Party remained wedded to theconcept of racial groups as the foundation of future politicalsystem.   ``We need to introduce into our society the principles of equaland equivalent franchise for all adults,'' the Democrats' leaderssaid. ``Anything short of a full democracy is a threat to our safefuture.''</TEXT></DOC>
