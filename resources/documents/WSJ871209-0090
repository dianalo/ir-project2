About $6.3 billion of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities guaranteed by banks with heavy Third-World debt loads face downgrading, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said yesterday.    The threatened downgradings affect issues whose credit is enhanced through a variety of arrangements with Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and New York-based Citicorp. The possible downgradings follow the ratings concern's decision last week to review its ratings of 11 major U.S. banks because of increasing risks from Third-World debt. Morgan Guaranty is a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.    The issues facing downgrade are all backed by pools of assets -- generally mortgages or car loans -- whose principal and interest payments are used to pay investors in the securities. In order to get a high rating, most asset-backed securities issues tack on a whole web of third-party credit enhancements, ranging from insurance policies and bank letters of credit to various kinds of investment agreements.    When the rating of those third parties is threatened, the securities' rating is also in danger. Although it's not automatic that a security will be downgraded if its guarantor's rating dropped, Christopher Baldwin, a vice president at Moody's, said in the case of the issues backed by Morgan, the security's rating is &quot;strongly&quot; dependent on the rating of the guarantor.    Financial guarantees have become an inextricable part of the increasingly popular asset-backed securities market, and that means investors are increasingly exposed to risk from areas they may not expect. That's especially true, Mr. Baldwin noted, as ratings agencies look harder at the ratings of financial institutions in general.    Between late August and yesterday, Moody's put almost $7 billion of asset-backed securities on watch for possible downgrading, all of them because a guarantor's rating was in jeopardy. Yesterday's announcement almost doubled that volume. In many of the earlier cases, Mr. Baldwin said, the guarantor in question was a Japanese bank.    Asset-backed securities need third-party credit support because most investors find it difficult to analyze the pool of assets underlying the security. They prefer to rely on the analysis done by a bank or insurance company. Issues guaranteed by Morgan figure heavily in yesterday's announcement largely because Morgan, as the only triple-A-rated New York bank, got a big share of that business.    In a related development, Moody's also yesterday put on watch for possible downgrade Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corp. mortgage pass-through certificates because the concern responsible for servicing the mortgages is a Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. subsidiary. Last week, Moody's put some of Shearson's ratings on watch for possible downgrade.    Kidder said that the securities' structure included provisions covering a possible downgrade of the servicer, and that if Shearson was downgraded, steps would be taken to make sure the securities' rating wasn't lowered as a result.    Mr. Baldwin said that all the agency's potential downgrades of asset-backed issues stem entirely from concern about the credit enhancer, not about the quality of the assets themselves.    Asset-backed securities are generally issued by a shell corporation or trust, in order to make sure that the corporation providing the assets isn't responsible for payment on the securities. Some sponsors, however, do provide partial guarantees. Ratings on about $6 billion of General Motors Acceptance Corp. securities were endangered Friday when some ratings of General Motors Corp., which provided a partial guarantee, were put on watch.    Here is a list of the issues Moody's put on watch yesterday:    Asset Backed Securities Corp., Series 1, 2, 4 and 6 ($5.7 billion); currently triple-A.    Greenwich CMO Trust I, Series A ($59 million); currently triple-A.    Shearson Lehman CMO Trust D ($150 million); currently triple-A.    Citicorp Mortgage Securities, Series 1987-20 and 1987-21 ($141 million); currently provisionally double-A-3.    Citibank Mortgage Pass-throughs, Series 1988-1 (amount not available); currently provisionally double-A-3.    Flags BV Euro Notes ($120 million); currently double-A-2. </TEXT></DOC>
