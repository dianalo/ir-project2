But Jimmy Knapp, head of the National Union of Railwaymen, saidthere were no plans to cancel Wednesday's 24-hour strike, whichwould be the fourth in as many weeks.   The one-day walkouts have disrupted services on the capital's reddouble-deckers, which carry 3.2 million people daily, as well as thetrains and subways, which carry nearly 5 million.   The labor talks were to begin Tuesday morning. Previous talksbroke down in early May over British Rail's proposed changes incollective bargaining.   Monday began what could be the worst week of industrial unrest inPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 years in power, as BritishRail train drivers began an overtime ban.   Also, the Transport and General Workers Union said 9,400dockworkers would strike at midnight Monday over the abolition of aproposal that would guarantee them job security.

British Rail said 120 of its 500 morning rush-hour trains werecanceled Monday in its busy southern region outside London becauseof the overtime ban by the 17,500 members of the Associated Societyof Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.   The railworkers, who want a 10 percent pay increase, haverejected a 7 percent offer. The union also demands an end to amanagement attempt to negotiate separately with different categoriesof workers.
