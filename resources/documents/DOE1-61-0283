The effect of different types of coal on the behaviourof the plant is examined. In the emission of harmful substances, theformation and reduction of NO and the release of SO/sub 2/ in the fluidizedbed are considered. The detailed information present in the extensivemodel are retained on a reduced process model for design of the controls.The optimum feedback developed on the basis of the reduced model showsgood control properties for the model, where the reduction of NO emissionand maintaining the O/sub 2/ concentration are to the forefront.
