(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   DeLaurentiis Entertainment GroupInc., left floundering by a string of box office flops, on Tuesdayfiled for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federalbankruptcy laws.   The move had been expected since Friday, when the companyfounded by Italian producer Dino DeLaurentiis revealed it hadfailed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termedessential for survival.   The company _ maker of the movies ``Crimes of the Heart'' and``Weeds'' and the TV miniseries ``Noble House'' _ has sold assetsand sought to restructure its debt in order to survive.   The company hasn't reported financial results for 1987, but hasannounced estimates of a $69 million loss.   The Chapter 11 filing begins a voluntary bankruptcy proceedingin which present management continues to operate the company, underthe supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to paycreditors and reorganize the company. Filing of the petitionimmediately puts a company's debts on hold.   In announcing the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in BeverlyHills, the company didn't list assets and liabilities.   The debt swap offer that failed last week would havedramatically reduced the company's $65 million bond debt by tradingexisting bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable toDeLaurentiis. The company hasn't revealed how many of itsbondholders agreed to accept the offer, other than to call theresponse disappointing.   Sale of DeLaurentiis' library of 300 films, including ``TheGraduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge,'' to British financier MichaelStevens brought $54 million in July. The company earlier sold itsshare in an Australian film distributor for $7 million.   The company previously announced an agreement for a new line ofcredit with Credit Lyonnais Bank of the Netherlands, but didn'treveal the amount.   DeLaurentiis, who was responsible for such box office successesas ``King Kong'' and ``Serpico,'' took his company public with astock offering in March 1986. But the company has failed to repeathis earlier success, and DeLaurentiis himself stepped aside inFebruary, giving management proxy voting control of his 61.9percent stake in the company.   The bankruptcy filing doesn't include DeLaurentiis EntertainmentGroup subsidiaries North Carolina Film Studios Inc. or OnyxEntertainment Inc., the company's newly formed production company.   Neither is an affiliated limited partnership, DeLaurentiis FilmPartners, affected by the filing.</TEXT></DOC>
