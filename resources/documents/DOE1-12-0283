<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0283 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Burnett-isochoric facility has been constructed in which the equationof state of fluids and fluid mixtures can be obtained in automatic fashionalong paths of constant volume. The automated working range is from 273-473K in temperature, and up to 10 MPa in pressure. How the automation ofpressure and temperature control and measurement has been achieved isdescribed. The apparatus has been used for the determination of the thermodynamicproperties of a working fluid mixture for a binary geothermal power cycle.The performance of the apparatus is evaluated by means of the data obtained.Plans for further improvement of range and accuracy are outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
