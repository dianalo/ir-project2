The Israeli army command confirmed the raid and said its planesbombed and destroyed Arab guerrilla posts and ammunition depotsnorth of Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon.   It said in a brief communique that the attacking jets returnedsafely to base after scoring accurate hits on their targets.
