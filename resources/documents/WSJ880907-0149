But beneath the general's sudden overtures to the opposition, there persists an absolute commitment on the part of the armed forces to retain power for at least another decade.    Over the past month, the 72-year-old president has lifted a state of emergency and allowed the return of opponents exiled since he seized power in a 1973 military coup. Donning a suit rather than his army uniform, he has gone on television to appeal to all Chileans to &quot;live in the fullness of freedom and democracy.&quot; Although growing opposition demonstrations have been repressed with ritual doses of tear gas and water cannons, arrests and brutality have been moderate by the regime's standards.    The military government, moreover, is stressing that it will mollify its policies after the Oct. 5 plebiscite, in which Chileans will vote &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the general extending his rule to 1997. It is portraying scheduled 1990 congressional elections as opening a new era of democracy and pluralism.    With the Pinochet government, however, it seems the more it changes, the more it stays the same. There is growing evidence that 15 years of rule, combined with recent economic successes, have convinced the president and the armed forces that they should have permanent control over Chile's politics.    In a speech last month, Gen. Santiago Sinclair, deputy commander-in-chief of the army, spoke of the &quot;visionary and titanic&quot; character of the mission assumed by the armed forces when they seized power in 1973. This mission, involving the quashing of Marxism and the establishment of institutional stability, wasn't completed, he said. &quot;We must continue,&quot; he declared, without specifying how long.    On the same day, Gen. Pinochet said members of the armed forces were ideally suited to political office and that the continued threat of Marxism &quot;obliges the armed forces to wage a permanent campaign.&quot;    &quot;It cannot be admitted that we should only be called on to intervene . . . in external conflicts,&quot; he told the army.    Implicit in all this, and in the government's choice of Gen. Pinochet rather than a figure of compromise as the candidate for the plebisicite, is the belief that communism still menaces Chile and that a return to civilian rule would merely open the way to it. Against this, the armed forces believe only they -- as representatives of the patriotic fervor that Gen. Pinochet mystically calls &quot;Chilenidad&quot; -- can stand firm.    The grandiose ritual of Gen. Pinochet's nomination as candidate suggested to many that all is already decided. Possibly abandoning the post of commander-in-chief, he will continue in office until 1997, working with a largely puppet Congress that will be depicted as representing a democratic transition. Beyond that, the army will remain fiercely committed to the defense of the 1980 constitution they devised, in which decisive powers rest with a military-dominated security council.    So what if the &quot;no&quot; vote wins? Such a victory is possible, many say probable. But the strong performance of the economy over the past three years and genuine fear of a resurgence of the left mean it is unlikely to be overwhelming. And only an overwhelming victory could start a movement Gen. Pinochet cannot control.    &quot;The military will not give up their mission for a few percentage points. They must have a fall-back position,&quot; says longtime human-rights activist Jose Zalaquett.    Nobody knows what this might be. In an intensely legalistic country, fraud is very unlikely, although on a small scale it can't be ruled out. But beyond that, the 1980 constitution gives Gen. Pinochet 17 months more in office in which to conjure an eventual narrow defeat -- anything up to 55%-45% -- into the need for the army to continue what Gen. Sinclair calls its &quot;transcendent mission.&quot;    What cannot be conjured away, however, by any last-minute, vote-seeking blandishments, are the deep conflicts in Chile centered on the person of Gen. Pinochet. He can never fill the role of an elder statesman presiding over national reconciliation. His determination to do so means more conflict is certain. The armed forces' polarizing vision of Chile will hold sway over one based in the quest for compromise. As a result, the general's eventual departure appears either distant or inevitably convulsive. </TEXT></DOC>
