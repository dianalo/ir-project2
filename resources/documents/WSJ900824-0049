They're far more likely to have working spouses, andthey're more interested in spending time with their children,the study found. They're also more likely to think aboutretiring early.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The rise of the two-career family has significantlychanged executive priorities,&quot; says Lester B. Korn, chairmanof Korn/Ferry International executive recruiters, whichconducted the survey last year with the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles Graduate School of Management, aswell as a similar study 10 years before.   Some things haven't changed much, however. Based on 698responses, the survey calculates that the typical executiveis much the same as in 1979: a 52-year-old white male,married with two children, who grew up in a house where hismother didn't work outside the home. Gains by women andminorities have been tiny.   The 1989 survey was sent to vice presidents and othersenior executives at Fortune 500 industrial and servicecompanies, &quot;the group from which future CEOs and presidentswill be selected,&quot; the report said. Responsibility,compensation and challenge remain the top three motivatingfactors to these executives, the study says; but they areless important across the board to today's executives, whoseek more satisfaction outside of work.   However, the executives are less interested in spendingtheir leisure time on travel or education than wereexecutives in previous years, according to theUCLA-Korn/Ferry survey. Spending time with spouses remainedin first place, followed by recreation. But the desire tospend time with children rose to third place from fourth.   One-fifth of the executives also reported they had refusedto relocate sometime during their career, with &quot;family&quot; asthe top reason given for turning down a move.   The increased concern about family probably is due in partto the growing number involved in dual-career families, thereport says. The proportion of executives whose spouses workoutside the home rose sharply, to 37% in 1989 from 14% in1979, according to the study. Most work in professional andtechnical jobs, but the percentage who work in clericalpositions dropped to 5% from 14% over the decade.   Some experts, though, question how widespread the changein family demographics is, particularly among those in thetraditionally male-dominated industrial companies. &quot;While wedo see it in a broad sense in our male employees, we have noevidence of it in senior management,&quot; says Faith Wohl, whodirects Du Pont Co.'s work and family, affirmative action anddiversity programs.   At Du Pont, where 76% of the work force is male, thecompany's extensive surveys have shown that male employeesare &quot;feeling and expressing the impact of family issues onthe day-to-day job very openly,&quot; she says. &quot;By and large,senior management people in Du Pont aren't yet experiencingthat in their day-to-day lives.&quot;   Instead, she sees the impact as coming from theexecutives' daughters and sons who have dual-careermarriages. &quot;The issue is hitting them not directly in theirown generation but in the next generation, and they'restarting to see the connections to family issues there,&quot; shesays.   The executives' increased focus on a personal or home lifeshows up in other ways as well in the survey. Compared with adecade ago, more executives surveyed today would retireearly, and fewer would work as long as possible.   &quot;We've experienced an economic boom, careers for highachievers have moved very quickly, and they've reaped majorfinancial rewards far faster than they had anticipated,&quot; saysCaroline W. Nahas, Korn/Ferry's managing partner for SouthernCalifornia. &quot;There's been a shakeout in terms of peoplesaying `Gee, I've achieved all this and during that time I'vemissed out on the personal life' and now they want to try tobalance that more.&quot;   This isn't to say that today's executives aren'tcompetitive, the report says. More of them have ambitions forthe CEO's job or ownership of the company than was the case10 years ago, the survey shows. More, too, are likely tochange companies, and a greater percentage are dissatisfiedwith their careers.   &quot;The ambitions are still strong,&quot; says Ms. Nahas, but theexecutives have reordered their priorities for their sparetime.   The slowest change is in terms of opening the doors of theexecutive suite to women and minorities. The percentage ofwomen at the top crawled to 3% from less than 1% in 1979.Just over 1% of top executives are ethnic minorities, barelyhigher than a decade before.   Women haven't yet advanced to the top in big numbersbecause of a &quot;blend&quot; of factors, says Ms. Nahas. Thoughdiscrimination hasn't disappeared, she also sees women&quot;making other decisions, like going into other businesses,and some who have dedicated themselves for the past 20 yearswho are now trying to balance their lives or start families.That whole convergence is limiting the numbers,&quot; of womenrising to the top of corporations.   Du Pont's Ms. Wohl says she isn't surprised by thesurvey's findings on the sparse number of senior womenexecutives. &quot;I can look around in our company and others likeit and see that progress has been made, but it's been longerthan anyone envisioned for it to have an impact, especiallyin large corporations,&quot; she says. Ten years ago, Du Pont hadnine women at manager level or above. Today, there are morethan 150 women in such senior positions, including women whorun large manufacturing plants.   Though more women will advance with time, Ms. Wohl citesother factors that &quot;are still getting in the way&quot; at manycompanies. These include an uneasiness on the part of somemale executives with women in senior management positions,she says, and inadequate efforts to help women with familyresponsibilities move up in organizations.   Many of the surveyed executives were more optimistic forthe future. Women will be a part of their corporation'ssenior management team in 2000, said 68% of the executives.Though the top 20 positions in their companies today are heldby an average 3% women, they predicted the percentage ofsenior women will rise to an average 16% by the turn of thecentury.</TEXT></DOC>
