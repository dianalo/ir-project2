At leastthree soldiers and two civilians died in the shootout.   Panicked residents of the working class San Ramon neighborhoodthrew themselves on the ground behind walls, parked vehicles andpiles of bricks at a masonry supply business as soldiers advanced onrebel attackers Thursday evening.   ``Commie dogs! Show yourselves, cowards!'' some soldiers shoutedas they moved forward, running in a crouch and pausing every fewyards to survey the scene, aim and fire.   The guerrillas attacked just before sunset, firing four anti-tankrockets at the state-owned ANTEL telephone switching station in SanRamon, on the northwestern edge of the city.   The attack on the telephone facility, which caused no casualtiesand only slight damage to a brick wall, appeared to be a diversion.   Minutes later, about 10 blocks away, a gunbattle broke out at theSan Ramon Civil Defense post, where about 20 soldiers were stationed.   Several dozen troops from the 1st Army Brigade on duty nearbyadvanced toward the post, and the exchange escalated into a fiercebattle that lasted nearly an hour.   Journalists saw at least three dead soldiers loaded onto a truck.Two civilians, one an adolescent boy, also were killed. ``There arelots of dead,'' one young soldier told a journalist.   Several soldiers were wounded, but there was no official casualtycount early today and no indication of rebel casualties.   The armed forces on Wednesday began what they said was athree-month halt to offensive operations in an effort to fosterpeace talks. The U.S.-backed government of President Jose NapoleonDuarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind.   The rebels said Wednesday they were willing to declare acease-fire once a time, place and agenda for peace talks is agreedupon.   The guerrillas have said they will participate in this year'spresidential election and respect its the outcome if it is postponedfrom March 19 until September, giving them time to prepare.   Earlier Thursday, the rebels said the army was violating its owncease-fire by moving into guerrilla-controlled territory.   ``That demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed cease-fire,''said the insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos.   It did not mention fighting as a result of army troop movements,which it said occurred in the northern zones of Morazan, San Migueland Chalatenango provinces.   Those areas are dominated by the rebels, who are waging anine-year revolution against the government.   A top army officer indicated the military would continue someoperations despite the cease-fire.   ``A cease-fire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes itsconstitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security,tranquility and stability,'' Col. Mauricio Vargas, commander of theeastern region, said in a televised interview Wednesday night.   ``If people are up in arms in any part of the nation's territory,we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them,'' he said.   The guerrillas accuse the government of procrastinating inresponse to their peace overture.   The U.S. State Department says the rebels' refusal to declare acease-fire calls into question their stated desire for peace.</TEXT></DOC>
