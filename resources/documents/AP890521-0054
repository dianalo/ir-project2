(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two boys who picketed a courthouse urginga judge to keep their younger siblings in a foster home away fromtheir homeless mother said Sunday that the judge has decided thecase to their liking.   ``It was worth it,'' 13-year-old Peter Carnes said of theafter-school protests he and 12-year-old brother Danny staged twicelast month outside the Kandiyohi County Courthouse. ``At least fornow we know they are not going back'' to their mother.   The boys said their mother, Margo Senescall, wanted to regaincustody of her two youngest children to beef up her welfare checks.Based on their own childhood experiences, the two boys said their9-year-old sister and 10-year-old brother would be subject to abuseunder her care.   Ms. Senescall could not be reached for comment. Telephone callsto the homeless shelter in Minneapolis where she lives were notreturned. Her attorney, Jay Liedman of Willmar, declined to comment.   Peter Carnes said Sunday that Judge John Lindstrom has decidedfor now to keep the younger children in a foster home in Willmar,not far from the foster home where he and Danny live.   Lindstrom said he could not comment because custody cases areconfidential.   ``I have made a decision and that's about all I can say,''Lindstrom said Sunday. ``There is nothing currently before me.''   Doris Lyman, the boys' foster mother, confirmed Peter's accountof the judge's decision.   ``As far as I know, it's 100 percent true,'' Lyman said. ``Fornow, that's the way it's going to be, but how long nobody knows.''   Danny Carnes said the boys decided to picket after they pleadedwith the judge unsuccessfully to throw out their mother's request.   ``We talked to the judge but he didn't listen,'' Danny said.``We told him our brother and sister might get killed and he said,`That's the chance we have to take.'''   ``The picketing was Peter's idea,'' he said. ``At first we feltweird but after a while we got used to it and it did us some good.''   The boys said their picketing in this west-central Minnesotatown of about 13,600 prompted letters on their behalf and a lawyerto volunteer his services.   It was the lawyer who informed them of the judge's decisionbecause the boys were not allowed to attend court hearings, PeterCarnes said. The lawyer, Pete Hendrickson of Minneapolis, told theboys there is still a chance their mother could regain custody ofthe younger children, Peter said.   Lindstrom has said custody cases are subject to review untilchildren reach adulthood.   He said in an interview that he was not swayed by the picketing.He said he relied strictly on evidence and testimony in court,where he heard conflicting stories.   ``I admire their courage,'' Lindstrom said. ``They are obviouslydeeply concerned. I think it's (the picketing) a very legitimateforum for them to express their concerns.''   Peter Carnes said he was sexually and physically abused by menwhile he was under his mother's care. He says he complained aboutthe abuse, but she did nothing.   ``She acts like she cares, but she doesn't,'' he said.   Danny Carnes says he also was physically abused by men whilewith his mother. The boys' parents divorced before the boys enteredelementary school and Ms. Senescall agreed about seven years ago toput the children in foster homes, Peter and Danny said.   Willard Carnes, 52, of Renville, said he couldn't care for hischildren because his job as a farm hand keeps him away from homefor long stretches and he doesn't earn much money. He said hisex-wife is unfit to care for the children, but he wouldn't givereasons.   ``They sure won't have the best of care, I'll put it that way,''he said.   The boys' picketing prompted Orvel and Janet Bratsch of ruralRenville to write a letter to Lindstrom. The couple knew the Carnesfamily before the parents divorced.   ``Please believe Danny and Peter!!'' the Bratsches wrote. ``Theyknow what they are talking about! Please do not send these childrento live with their unfit mother.''</TEXT></DOC>
