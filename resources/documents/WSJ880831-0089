Cherokee earlier this month rejected a sweetened $13-a-share, or $156 million, proposal from the group. Cherokee said the group has since submitted other proposals, details of which the company didn't disclose, but those have been found &quot;inadequate from a financial point of view&quot; by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which is serving as financial adviser to the special committee of the board. Cherokee, a Sunland, Calif., apparel maker, said the investor group has indicated it plans to submit one further proposal for the committee to consider.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cherokee shares closed at $12.25, off 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
