PLC to9.9 percent from 21.68 percent.   The period represents a compromise between the five years soughtby the Kuwait Investment Office, which is the London-basedinvestment arm of the Kuwaiti government, and the one yearoriginally recommended by the British Monopolies and MergersCommission.   Trade Secretary Lord Young in October ordered Kuwait to reduceits BP holding to 9.9 percent after the monopolies commission said alarger holding by Kuwait ``might be expected to operate against thepublic interest.''   The commission cited Kuwait's role as a member of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The Kuwaiti office was satisfied with the three-year divestmentperiod, said John Jeffrey of Stephenson Harwod, the office's lawfirm. The time span gives the office sufficient leeway to minimizeits losses, Jeffrey said.   In recommending a one-year divestment period, the monopoliescommission had said the timing of the sale should be subject to someflexibility in light of current stock market conditions.   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its BP holding, amountingto 1.316 billion shares, by purchasing partly-paid BP stock in themonths following the British government's $13.2 billion publicoffering of BP shares in October 1987, which coincided with thestock market crash.   The offering, which was far undersubscribed, included thegovernment's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP, plus $2.7 billionworth of new BP shares.   Kuwait must sell around 700 million shares to reduce its holdingto the required level.   Analysts recently have speculated that BP might be planning tobuy back the Kuwaiti-held shares.   The speculation was prompted by BP's confirmation this week thatit is negotiating to sell most of its mineral assets to RTZ Corp.Analysts say the sale could be raise about $3.5 billion.   Once the Kuwaiti office has made the final payment on the partlypaid shares next April, the 700 million shares to be disposed ofwill be worth around $3.3 billion.   BP refused to comment on the timetable, or on speculation about ashare buyback.   BP shares closed up 2 pence, about 4 cents, at 259 pence, or$4.74, Friday on the London Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
