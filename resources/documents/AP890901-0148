U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said the complainant in thecase failed to prove that the news report was false and the reporterwas protected under the ``neutral reporting doctrine.''   The case revolves around the death of a Hawaiian environmentalactivist named George Helm, who a biweekly newspaper on June 15,1977 ``strongly implied'' had been killed by local underworldfigures.   Dennis Stone, a UPI reporter, filed a story based on thenewspaper report and an interview with the missing man's father. Thestory said the missing activist had been threatened by a member ofHawaii's Board of Land and Natural Resources named Larry Mehau,according to George Helm's brother and father.   Stone's story also said the brother, Adolph, identified Mehau asthe ``godfather'' of Hawaii's underworld crime.   In a subsequent dispatch the same day, Stone wrote that themissing activist had told his brother, Adolph, that he was planningto expose Mehau and others.   The next day, UPI distributed a story detailing the Hawaiigovernor's strong defense of Mehau and rejection of the bi-weeklynewspaper story.   Mehau quickly sued UPI and lost two years later at the triallevel. On appeal, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed the decision,saying that Stone acted with actual malice when he filed his twostories.   The case was remanded to the federal court in Hawaii and removedto the Disrict of Columbia when UPI went into bankruptcy here.   Finally the case was switched from bankruptcy court to thedistrict court and ended up with Richey.   ``... the disputed facts indicated the Mehau has failed to proveby a fair preponderance of the evidence that Stone's reports arefalse,'' said Richey.   ``Further the undisputed facts indicated that Stone's reports areabsolutely protected under the neutral reportage doctrine, which theCourt adopts herein for the first time in this circuit.''</TEXT></DOC>
