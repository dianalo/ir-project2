The use ofanimal-derived materials for household adornment.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HUNTING ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL FURNISHINGS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Michael Walsh is a contributing writer for Metropolitan Home and HouseBeautiful magazines.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Increased sensitivity toward animal rights and the environment and theever-growing list of endangered species are prompting some to question certaindecorating styles -- from Southwest to hunting-lodge to out-of-Africa chic.;   Personally, I've been feeling guilty for three years about the mounted deerhead in my living room. Now, I'm not a hunter. In fact, the killing of wildanimals is not what I consider a sport. I bagged my trophy at an antiqueshop.;    I just didn't think about the moral implications -- until I got ithome and on the wall. Then, instead of a trophy or an artifact, I saw a sadperversion. And I began to recognize the part I had played -- albeit at arm'slength -- in fostering a market that ultimately supports animal killing forpleasure.;    Suddenly, I was no longer morally superior to the guy who pulledthe trigger or the woman who wears a coat made from the hide of a coyote or ababy seal that she didn't personally slaughter. And I began to realize thatfor years I had been only too happy to admire home furnishings derived fromanimals: bearskin rugs, fox throws and antler chandeliers. I'd never givenmuch thought to the fact that a bearskin rug was once a bear, a fox throw wasonce a pack of foxes and that an antler chandelier was made from the crownsworn by of who knows how many late stags.;    So, all right, lesson learned.No more deer heads, no more antlers, no more polar-bear rugs. No more lustingfor the masculine rusticity of the hunting lodge, or the exotica of the safaritent.;    But what about leather furniture, steer-hide rugs, suede pillows,goose-down comforters, wool carpeting and that icon of Southwest style, thebleached cow skull?;    Frankly, reconciling all the points of view onanimal-derived home decorating is beyond me. I'm not a purist, just a typicalmiddle-of-the-roader. But, if pressed, I suppose I'd have to say that I thinkit's all right to use materials from domesticated, agricultural animals forhome furnishings and decorative accessories -- as long as they are a byproductof food production.;    One way to sidestep the issue is to purchase man-madelook-alikes. Lighting manufacturers offer synthetic stag-horn fixtures. Rugmakers duplicate the look of zebra, tiger, leopard and other wild animal hidesby printing on steer hides or synthetic fibers. Animal-print fabrics arewidely available.;    Yet another compromise is to approximate the look ofexotic animal materials yourself. That's what Michael Lane, a contributingeditor to Decorating andamp; Remodeling magazine, did. A wildlife conservationist atheart, he painted a faux tortoise-shell mirror frame with black andburnt-sienna acrylic paint over a base of yellow ocher. For a leopard chaircushion, he dabbed fabric paint on cotton velvet. And on a coarse sisal rug heused black acrylic paint to create a zebra's stripes.;    &quot;There's really noreason these days to use real wild animals, endangered or not, for decoratingbecause there are so many alternatives,&quot; Lane says. &quot;Besides, there is anelement of fantasy, whimsy and hand-craftsmanship in approximating the look.In that way, it becomes better than the real thing.&quot;;    Still, as a designconsultant, Lane sometimes finds himself torn between personal convictions andprofessional obligations.;    &quot;I pretty much try to avoid natural animalmaterials across the board,&quot; he says. &quot;But, if it's something a client alreadyhas and is particularly drawn to, it's pretty hard to pull them away fromit.&quot;;    Instead of proselytizing, Lane teaches by example.;    &quot;I liken it tothe time I stopped drinking, about five years ago,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't do muchtalking about that either. But people noticed, and I think I passivelyinfluenced the way they looked at their own drinking habits. The same thingapplies to my design projects. &quot;I just don't use real animal elements, and, inthe long run, I think that's a lot more effective than preaching.&quot;;    In theend, like Lane, each of us will have to decide what is essential to thecomfort and enjoyment of our homes and what our values are regarding allcreatures great and small.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL WALSH  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910803  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  772  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 3, 199100216001,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
