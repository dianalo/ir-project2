Great!   Terrific! I'll pass.''   When the agent explained that coproducers Frank Marshall,Kathleen Kennedy and Steven Spielberg were involved in the project,Daniels agreed to read the script. And liked it. His verdict: ``Ifanybody can do this in a first-class way, those guys can.''   After years of directing second unit on Spielberg films, FrankMarshall made his debut as director with ``Arachnophobia.'' Besidesthe human actors _ Daniels, John Goodman, Julian Sands, Harley JaneKozak _ Marshall directed hundreds of spiders that invade a smallCalifornia town.   ``I don't mind the little guys,'' Daniels admitted. ``I'm prettymuch a manly man when it comes to that sort of thing. But the bigboys, nine inches across with the legs spread out, the kind thatspit at you.''   ``They had a `spider orientation' on the second day of shooting.We were all supposed to go and basically learn how to becomefriends with the spiders and have them crawl on you as pets. I blewthat off. If we're supposed to be afraid of spiders, let's beafraid of spiders.''   ``If there's any opportunity at all to eliminate acting I'm allfor it. In the second half of this movie, there's not a lot ofacting going on. It's personal terror.''   Danile said 90 per cent of the spiders in ``Arachnophobia'' arethe real thing, the rest are mechanical. The actor was fascinatedby the special affects _ ``that's one of the reasons I did thispicture: I wanted to see how they did it. And I had the best seatin the house.''   With his gangly frame and bland, blond looks, Jeff Daniels oftengoes unrecognized for his solid contributions to films. He was fineas Debra Winger's errant husband in ``Terms of Endearment,'' but hewas neglected in the shower of Academy nominations for the film(``I think even the guy who combed my hair was nominated'').   He rationalized: ``When I saw `Rain Man,' I said, `Hoffman isgreat, but Cruise is the guy who makes the movie work.' The guyswho win the awards are the guys who get the flashy roles. It'salways been that way.''   ``It's the same thing with `Arachnophobia.' Somebody's gottakeep it all together. I'm the hub that goes through the movie.People see the movie through me.''   ``Hey, the whole point is to make a scene look as though it'snot acting. The phone keeps ringing. People keep hiring me. I mustbe doing something right. It's okay. I'm glad to play the straightman for a spider.''</TEXT></DOC>
