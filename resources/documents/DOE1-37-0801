When applicable, the overall average timeswere compared with extant Canadian work-load statistics. In six of the14 examinations for which Canadian standards exist, the average timesdiffered by 25% or more. The data were further analyzed to adjust timeestimates for the effects of different hospital characteristics (e.g.,number of beds, teaching status), patient characteristics (e.g., ambulation,outpatient status), and examination characteristics (e.g., number ofviews, resident involvement). The key factors and the magnitude of theireffects varied from examination to examination, but the effects weregenerally large enough to have managerial significance. The factors canbe evaluated by individual hospitals to produce customized estimatesof average examination times. The data presented in this report can beused in management control systems by radiology departments in hospitalsof varying sizes and teaching characteristics.</TEXT></DOC>
