Press Enter.andP;  Now set the height so that the box sitting on the bottommargin will extend high enough to cover the letterhead.andP;  (For example, ifyour letterhead is an inch deep, set the height of the box to 1.3 to fudge alittle extra room above the letterhead.) Press Enter and then E for Edit.andO;Press Enter again so that an invisible carriage retum is the only thing inthe box.andP;  Press Exit once to finish the Edit function and again to leave thebox menu.andM;Since this procedure has so many steps, it's better to put them into a macro.andO;Or you can save a blank document that already has the box defined on it.andO;Then, the next time you write a letter, call up the file with the box in it,rename the file, and type the letter.andP;  You can adapt the procedure to definean unprintable region on the left if your stationery lists the board ofdirectors along the left side.andM;Easy BackupsandM;WordPerfect lets you fmd all the files in a directory that contain aparticular word or meet certain conditions.andP;  You can use this feature to markand copy aU the files in a directory that have changed since your lastbackup.andP;  (This can be done with any files, not just WordPerfect documents.andP;  )andM;Choose List Files (F5), then 9 or W for WordSearch and 4 or C for Conditions.andO;Then choose 4 or D to select by File Date and confirm the Yes by pressingEnter.andP;  Type the date you last backed up as the From: Date, press Enter twomore times, and you're back at the List Files menu.andP;  WordPerfect has placedan asterisk next to each file with a date on or after your last backup.andM;Now that the changed files have been marked, use the Copy feature to copy themarked files to a floppy disk.andP;  Just choose 8 or C for Copy.andP;  WhenWordPerfect p&quot;Copy marked files?&quot; you should respond with a Y for Yes.andP;  Thenext WordPerfect prompt will read &quot;Copy all marked files to:&quot;.andP;  Type A: or B:as the files' destination, and all your new files in that subdirectory willbe copied to a floppy.andM;MicroSoft ExcelandM;Blanks in Charts When you create a chart from a range of cells that contain ablank in the middle of the data, Excel normally plots the blank cells as partof the data.andP;  But there's a way to have Excel include only cells with data inthe graph.andM;Place the formula =NA() in the blank cells, and Excel will ignore any cellcontaining that formula while it is charting.andP;  This works only if the blankcells are in the middle of a range, not at one end of the data.andM;Cleaner PrintoutsandM;For clean-looking printouts, select Options Display and deactivate theGridlines option.andP;  This removes the default vertical and horizontal linesfrom your Excel spreadsheet-dead giveaways that your printouts were generatedfrom an electronic spreadsheet.andM;Once the gridlines are turned off, you can use the Border...andP;  option toenhance your printouts.andP;  For example, the following technique will createvertical lines to separate portions of your worksheet: 1.andP;  Click on a columnheading to activate that column.andM;2.andP;  Select Format Border...andP;  .andM;3.andP;  Activate the Right option in the Border...andP;  dialog box and click on OK.andM;A solid vertical line is added to the right border of the selected column.andM;Experiment with the various Border...andP;  options; used creatively, they canreally spruce up your documents.andM;Lotus 1-2-3andM;Faster Recalls  Your income and expenses for a past month aren't going tochange.andP;  But each time your spreadsheet is recalculated, 1-2-3 evaluatesformulas that depend on your past income and expenses.andP;  You can cut down onrecalculation time by changing the formulas into numbers.andM;Bring up the menu and choose Range Value.andP;  Then highlight the range offormulas based on numerical information that will no longer change and pressEnter twice.andP;  Formulas will be replaced by their current numerical value andwill not be reevaluated with each recalculation.andM;To change a single cell from a formula to a value, just position your cursoron that cell and press Edit (F2) Calc (F9) followed by Enter.andM;Sum Multiple RangesandM;Undoubtedly, you've used an @SUM in 1-2-3 to add up a row or column ofnumbers.andP;  But did you know that you could use an @SUM to total a rectangle ofnumbers? You can even use one @SUM to total several ranges or severalindividual cells around your spreadsheet.andP;  Here's how.andM;Move your cursor to the cell in which you want your total to appear.andP;  Type@SUM( by itself.andP;  Then move your cursor to the comer of the first range youwant to include in the total.andP;  Anchor the start of the range by typing aperiod and moving the cursor to highlight the fast range (column orrectangle).andP;  Type a comma, position your cursor at a comer of the next rangeyou wish to include in the sum, and repeat the process.andP;  To include anindividual cell, just type a comma after positioning your cursor on thatcell.andP;  When you've highlighted the final range or have your cursor on thefinal cell you wish to include, type a closing parenthesis and press Enter.andM;Microsoft WordandM;Easier Landscape and Portrait Printing Usually you print an entire documentin your laser printer's portrait mode (81/2 by 11 inches) or landscape mode(11 by 8 1/2).andP;  In Microsoft Word, you can write a macro that helps you printboth ways in the same document.andP;  To create the macro in Word 4.0, enter thefollowing macro, highlight it, and save it to the glossary with a glossaryname and control code, such as Ctrl-P.andP;  (words in brackets representkeystrokes, and allcapital words indicate Word macro functions.)andM;andless; Esc andgt; po.PAUSE Enter printer name and press Enter./ andless; Tab (6 times) andgt; p andless;Tab andgt; .PAUSE/ andless; Enter andgt; p andless; Esc andgt; po.PAUSE Enter printer name and pressEnter./ andless; Tab (6 times) andgt; p andless; Tab andgt; .PAUSE/ andless; Enter andgt; pandM;Set up your document with the proper margins.andP;  Type Ctrl-P and you'll beprompted for the printer driver you want to use and the pages to print.andO;After they print, you'll be prompted for another driver, usually thelandscape driver, and for the remaining pages.andP;  You need to know which pagesare to have each orientation, and the pages may not come out in the properorder.andP;  For Word 5.0, run the macro through the macro converter to adjust forchanges in the menu structure.andM;dBaseandM;Automatic Notes dBASE has a couple of built-in ways of taking notes on yourdiscoveries.andP;  You can record the commands you enter and dBASE's responses ina file.andP;  At the dot prompt, enter SET ALTERNATE TO notel.andP;  In this case thename of the file will be NOTE I.TXT, but the name is up to you.andP;  Then enterSET ALTERNATE ON.andP;  The dBASE commands you enter and dBASE's responses will berecorded until you enter CLOSE ALTERNATE.andP;  When you leave dBASE, you canretrieve the file into your word processor.andM;If you've just completed a series of tricky commands but forgotten to recordthem using the Alternate command, just open a note-taking file and, at thedot prompt, type DISPLAY HISTORY.andP;  dBASE remembers and displays your mostrecent commands, which are then captured in the Alternate file.andM;Be sure to enter CLOSE ALTERNATE before you leave dBASE, or the contents ofyour note-taking file will be lost.andM;Easier Data EntryandM;The problem with databases is that someone has to do the data entry.andP;  You cancut down on data entry time in dBASE III by programming the function keys totype out frequently used words or phrases.andP;  At the dot prompt, just enter:andM;SET FUNCTION 2 TO &quot;Street&quot;andM;Then, each time you press F2, dBASE will type out the word &quot;Street.&quot; You canalso reprogram the function keys via menus that appear when you enter thecommand SET.andP;  Select Keys on the menu and select the key you wish to change.andO;Press Enter, type in the word or words you want the key to type, press Enteragain, and escape back to the dot prompt.andP;  If you type a semicolon after yourtext, dBASE will translate the semicolon as an Enter.andM;ProcommandM;Single-Key Macros  Like all good telecommunications progams, ProComm Plusoffers user-programmable keyboard macros.andP;  But pressing two keys to generatea keystroke sequence can be a nuisance for the fumble-fingered,andM;Fortunately, you can use the program's keyboard mapping feature to createsingle-key macros.andP;  Just press AltF8 to get a menu of reassignable keys, andfollow the steps to assign functions and/or text to keys you rarely use.andO;Take care not to redefine an indispensable key; function and numeric keypadkeys are the best reassignment candidates.andP;  Be sure to make a backup copy ofthe original PCPLUS.KBD file before you attempt this.andM;Harvard GraphicsandM;Using Print Preview Experienced Harvard Graphics users always keep one eye onthe function key menu along the bottom of the screen.andP;  The menu's entriesadjust as you move among the program's many functions.andP;  But even veteranchart makers often miss one inconspicuous entry that comes into view justbefore you print a new chart or graphic.andM;Once you've chosen Produce Output from the Harvard Graphics main menu, F2relinquishes its usual role.andP;  Rather than displaying an approximaterepresentation of the current chart, F2-now labeled &quot;Preview&quot;-displays anaccurate full-color or black-and-white view of how the chart appears whenprinted.andM;Choosing a Print Preview with this method offers a far more accuraterepresentation of the final chart than the F2-Draw Chart preview you usedwhile creating it.andP;  A Print Preview faithfully shows the positioning andrelative sizes of text and graphic objects.andP;  Even borders, invisible onstandard F2 chart previews, show up on Print Previews.andP;  Now you can findsubtle eff ors before you print charts, rather than after.andM;To see a Print Preview, follow these steps:andM;1.andP;  Press Esc to return to the main menu after you complete a chart.andP;  2.andO;Choose Produce Output from the main menu.andM;3.andP;  Press F2 (Preview) to draw the chart onscreen, precisely as it willappear when printed.andM;Just as with the standard F2 chart preview, you can press Esc to quit a PrintPreview.andM;SprintandM;Error MessagesandM;Error Messages When something goes haywire in Borland's Sprint wordprocessor, you're presented with only a bare-bones, cryptic message, such as&quot;Error 37.&quot; And Sprint's documentation fails to describe the program's eff orcodes, leaving you to wonder what went wrong.andM;Here is a list of common Sprint eff or messages and their definitions:andM;Error 30-Load Failure: Unable to load a file.andM;Error 31-Run Failure: Unable to run a file.andP;  The file is corrupted or notenough memory is available.andM;Error 36-System Command Error: A command line eff or.andM;Error 50-Convcrsion Effor: Error in a document to be converted; you may havetried to convert a file you shouldn't have.andM;Effor 51-Input Effor: Problem in opening an input file; you may have used thewrong filename or an illegal filename.andM;Effor 52-Output Error: Difficulty in producing an output file.andM;Error 54-Command Error: Not enough room for work files.andM;Effor 55-Memory Effor: Memory allocation failure.andM;Ventura PublisherandM;Getting Dialog Boxes One useful Ventura shortcut is to use Ctrl-X toredisplay the most recently used dialog box.andP;  That way, you don't have toreselect menus and specify menu options all over again to repeat the lastoperation you performed.andP;  You will fmd Ctrl-X especially helpful whencropping and sizing an imported graphic.andP;
