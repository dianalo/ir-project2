PHILIPS of the Netherlands, marking one of Taiwan's biggest investments in the semiconductor industry.    The venture, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., was established with $145 million in capital. Of the total, 48.3% will come from the Taiwanese government, 27.5% from the Dutch concern and the rest from several Taiwanese companies, including Formosa Plastics Corp.    Industrial officials said the venture represented a significant government commitment to assist Taiwan's smaller semiconductor companies in manufacturing wafers, which are silicon disks on which circuit designs for computer chips are etched. Most semiconductor companies in the Asian nation can't afford the huge capital investment required in making wafers used in larger-scale integrated circuits. Consequently, they rely on imports.    But companies that buy wafers from abroad are concerned that their technology might be leaked to rival semiconductor companies, industry officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
