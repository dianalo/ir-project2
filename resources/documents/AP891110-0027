Accompanying this stage may be a tendency to getdisoriented in time or space, to lose one's way or wander, and tolose the capacity to care for themselves.   Also apparent may be an exaggeration of existing personalitytraits _ extreme anger if the person is normally hot-tempered,extreme passivity if the person is normally placid; or an extremetendency to wander if the person is normally an ``on-the-go'' type.   _Severe confusion and disorientation, with possiblehallucinations or delusions.
