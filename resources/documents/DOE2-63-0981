It is being found that magnetic tape,the major information handling medium, is no longer the ideal storagetechnology. Huge data volumes, online/random access, and increased recordingspeeds have exceeded the capabilities of tape. This paper discusses theapplication of optical disk technology according to two categories: thereplacement of tape with optical disks in existing systems, and the redesignof existing systems, or building new systems, that make the maximum useof optical disk technology. The areas of data collection, interpretation,and archiving are examined to see how that technology can be applied.A review of optical disk applications within the petroleum industry showsthat most of these applications are experimental, but larger scale usewill start this year. Interest in the technology from within the industryis due to the current and future demands on information systems. Butit is important to realize optical disks will not replace magnetic technologyfor three main reasons: the write-once-only feature of the current technologyprevents direct replacement; magnetic technology is still developingand costs are dropping; and the sheer amount of information currentlystored on magnetic medium prevents any rapid switch to optical disk.In the short term, data archiving and interpretation appear to be mostin need of optical technology. As for the future, new information systemswhich include expert systems and very large databases will probably incorporateoptical technology.</TEXT></DOC>
