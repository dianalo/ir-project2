The answer, say many executives gathered here for theannual meeting of the Association of National Advertisers,may be &quot;never.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this year, many had confidently predicted arecovery by year end. By summer, they revised that forecastto mid-1992. Now most executives interviewed say they don'tsee any upturn until 1993 at the earliest. Many have stoppedthinking about an end to this slump at all: The nation'srecession, they say, masks a fundamental change in thestructure of the marketing business. Advertising may neverbounce back to its previous levels, because the business ofboth agencies and clients has changed for good.   &quot;Cutting budgets is a fact of life,&quot; says James C. Reilly,general manager of marketing services for InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. Clients and agencies shouldn't waitfor the business climate to recover because the changes &quot;arefundamental and irrevocable. You can't manage by nostalgia orwishful thinking.&quot;   IBM's ad budget has declined every year for the past fewyears, and its best-case scenario for 1992 is for flatspending -- which, since media prices continue to rise,translates into less advertising yet again. The decline hasprompted it to reformulate its entire approach toadvertising; it now is concentrating on &quot;macro&quot; ads,positioning the computer giant as a leader, and creatingfewer &quot;micro&quot; ads talking about specific product features.   The computer giant is in plentiful company. Ad spending byUAL Corp.'s United Airlines peaked in 1988, and has sincefallen or been flat every year, says John Ruhaak, vicepresident of advertising and promotion. Other advertisersalso report flat or declining spending; some even suggest thead business is in a depression rather than a recession.   So glum is the ad picture that even McCann-Erickson'sperennially optimistic forecaster, Robert Coen, says totalspending this year will be flat or lower than last year --making it the worst year in more than two decades. Just ayear ago, he was forecasting a 4.6% increase.   Mr. Coen is still optimistic about 1992, because both theelections and the Olympics generally give a boost to adspending. But most advertisers interviewed disagree. What'smore, executives gathered here are haunted by the prospect ofa potential advertising tax, on either the federal or statelevel. Any tax would put even more of a crimp in spending.And any prospect of recovery is cloudy -- not just foradvertising, but for all of business -- because of themassive budget deficit, says DeWitt Helm, president of theAssociation of National Advertisers.   For the more than 450 advertising executives expected toattend the gathering here, the challenge is to find a way toget a greater impact out of smaller budgets. Much of thatburden will fall on their ad agencies. But the agencies,already squeezed by client fee-cutting and recessionary illsof their own, have been laying off employees and cuttingservices such as research at an alarming rate. They areprepared to offer less service, not more.   Herb Baum, president of Campbell Soup Co.'s North Americanoperations, says agencies nevertheless must act more aspartners, advising advertisers not just on ads but on theirtotal business. Campbell is one of the few advertisers toincrease its ad budget for its fiscal year, which began Aug.1. But its planned 29% increase was possible not becauseCampbell is so optimistic, but because it hired consultantMcKinsey andamp; Co. to search for cost-savings elsewhere, such ascutbacks in couponing.   Ideally, an ad agency should be a &quot;total business adviser.What we really need is a miniature McKinsey with a creativeand media department,&quot; Mr. Baum suggests.   Failing that, ad agencies need to reposition theirclients' products for the more cautious and traditionalmindset of the 1990s. Sean Fitzpatrick, vice chairman of adagency McCann-Erickson, says even the most expensive brandsmust be pitched as basic necessities and as a good value forthe money. &quot;In this new era of the '90s, with this new valuesystem, you're going to see a shakeout as products andbusinesses {that don't reposition themselves} fail,&quot; says Mr.Fitzpatrick, one of an unusually large number of agencyexecutives planning to descend on this conference of clients.   The recovery will be selective, Mr. Fitzpatrick believes,bypassing advertisers that fail to convince consumers thatthey are providing the best value for the money. Even whenthe economy improves, that old adage, &quot;The high tide raisesall boats,&quot; he warns, &quot;may not be true any more.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
