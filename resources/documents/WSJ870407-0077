Jack Kemp, asserting that Republicans still have much to accomplish, joined the presidential race and vowed to transform it into a &quot;national referendum&quot; on the Strategic Defense Initiative.    In a three-state campaign swing, the Buffalo Republican sought to identify himself with a range of conservative causes -- the struggles against communism, abortion, taxes and protectionism -- while staking out a very strong position on developing, testing and deploying an anti-nuclear shield.    &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative is the greatest peace initiative of our time,&quot; he said, &quot;and we can deploy it.&quot; Criticizing both the Democrats and the State Department for their willingness to use the plan, known as &quot;Star Wars,&quot; as a bargaining chip, Mr. Kemp said &quot;the central drama of the 20th century is the struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, but the central dilemma of our day is that we lie defenseless against Soviet missiles.&quot;    Mr. Kemp's formal announcement in New Hampshire, site of the first 1988 presidential primary, was the culmination of a public career that began in the huddles of the Buffalo Bills football team, moved to Congress in 1971 and continued with his sometimes lonely advocacy of what became the twin principles of Republican economic policy: tax cuts and tax overhaul.    Now his candidacy is based on a careful balance of support for President Reagan, who adopted many of Rep. Kemp's economic ideas, and of rhetoric that seeks to expand the party's programs and appeal. &quot;What a long way we've come in the last six years, but what a long way we have to go,&quot; Mr. Kemp said. &quot;There is more hope and less poverty, but too many have been left behind and there's too much despair.&quot;    Mr. Kemp's political challenge is to retain the support of conservative activists -- their alliance has at times been uneasy -- while extending his reach beyond traditional GOP voting groups, including working people and blacks. In speeches yesterday, he pledged to bring his campaign &quot;to inner-city families so that we, the party of Lincoln, can once again hold up the dreams of liberty and justice for all&quot; and suggested that the U.S. play a mediating role in South Africa.    Despite more than two years of active campaigning, the nine-term congressman has moved little in the polls and is generally considered to be trailing both Vice President George Bush and Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas. Although the Kemp strategy calls for a respectable showing in the Iowa precinct caucuses in February 1988 and then a victory here eight days later, a recent Boston Globe poll of New Hampshire Republicans shows Mr. Kemp with the support of only 8%, compared with Mr. Bush's 49% and Mr. Dole's 12%.    But Mr. Kemp, who bounced around pro football as a quarterback before finding a home in Buffalo's War Memorial Stadium, has made optimism both a political tactic and a political principle. In appearances yesterday, he emphasized growth and opportunity and deliberately criticized politicians of both parties &quot;who look to the future with such anxiety and such pessimism that they can only think of ideas which would impose austerity and pain, protectionism and isolationism.&quot;    And in an effort to prove himself on issues beyond the economy and tax cuts, Mr. Kemp staked out a strong position against &quot;the Soviet Colonial Empire&quot; and in favor of winning &quot;back to freedom what has been lost in both hemispheres,&quot; pledging U.S. &quot;moral and material support (but) not American troops&quot; to &quot;freedom-fighter movements&quot; around the world.    &quot;This country cannot abandon its friends or appease an adversary who defines 'peace' as the final triumph of communism,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us unite behind a strategy for victory that says we must go beyond containing communism to the ultimate triumph of freedom and democracy.&quot;    Mr. Kemp, 51 years old, favors a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, but in his remarks yesterday emphasized simple congressional legislation to allow states to restrict abortion.    He called for &quot;full employment without inflation&quot; and renewed his pledge to work for a gold standard and &quot;to oppose any plan, from any quarter, that raises taxes on the American people.&quot;    The opening day of the Kemp campaign ended in Buffalo, home to two earlier presidents, Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland. Mr. Cleveland began his campaign with a simple letter the week before the Democrats' 1884 convention in Chicago -- a sharp contrast to the foam footballs, jet tour and soaring rhetoric that marked the opening of the Kemp campaign.    &quot;We have so much to do and a long way to go as we get ready for the decade of the 1990s,&quot; Mr. Kemp said. &quot;Like the good shepherd, America must reach out to the weak and to those who have fallen behind.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
