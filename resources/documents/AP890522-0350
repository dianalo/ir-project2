The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13-16 point, ornearly $12 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield fell to 8.59percent, the lowest closing yield since March 1988, and was downfrom 8.70 percent on Friday. Bond prices and yields move inopposite directions.   The dollar broke an important psychological barrier, 2 WestGerman marks, and hit a 1{-year high against the Japanese yendespite repeated intervention by central banks and a plea from theWhite House to depress the U.S. currency.   The dollar's surge helped spark a sharp drop in commodityprices, and that in turn increased bond traders' hopes thatinflation would slow down and the economy would cool off, analystssaid.   When the economy is slow, the Federal Reserve Board is lesslikely to tighten credit, which raises interest rates and sendsbond prices lower.   Mitchell Held, chief financial economist with Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., said money that had flowed out of bonds asinterest rates rose was changing direction and moving back intoTreasury securities.   ``People are realizng the economy is slowing down,'' he said.``People are underinvested in bonds.''   Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone andamp; McCarthy ResearchAssociates Inc., a money market research firm, said he expectedbond prices to continue to move higher because ``There's a lot ofpeople who want to get on the bandwagon.''   ``We've probably seen the high (interest) rates for thisbusiness cycle,'' he said.
