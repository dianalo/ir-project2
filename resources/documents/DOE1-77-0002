The degree to which the responsible party can exercise technicallicense in designing a ground-water monitoring system varies betweencomponents of the system. However, the responsible party must convincethe regulatory agency that the data collected truly represent the ground-watersystem and that the approach taken is technically sound. While much progresshas been made toward developing tools and strategies for adequately characterizingdisposal sites, additional developments are needed in both monitoringhardware and interpretive techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
