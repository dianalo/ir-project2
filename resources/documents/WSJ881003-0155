Seeking to foster team spirit as well as to discourage raiders, companies increasingly are making employees who rarely set foot in the executive suite eligible to receive stock options.    &quot;We're seeing a proliferation of stock incentives for middle and lower managers and even for non-management employees,&quot; says Robert Salwen, a principal at Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc., executive-compensation consultants in New York.    Gordon Wolf, a vice president at TPFandamp;C Inc., an executive-consulting firm in New York, adds that while some companies have placed less emphasis on stock incentives for senior executives since last fall's stock-market crash, equity awards nonetheless &quot;are spreading downward because they're a cost-effective way to deliver value to employees.&quot;    Many companies are now making four or five times as many employees eligible for stock options as they were two years ago, according to a recent survey of 700 corporations by the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. in New York. And &quot;it's been my experience that people who become eligible for options generally get them&quot; if they do their jobs well, says Peter Chingos, director of Peat Marwick's executive-compensation practice. A few companies are giving options in lieu of pay increases, he adds, but so far those are the exceptions.    At many companies where only 2% or 3% of all employees -- mainly high-level executives -- had been eligible for stock options, some 15% are now eligible, including plant managers and assistant vice presidents, says Peat Marwick. At the companies surveyed, the median salary of employees eligible for options has fallen in the past two years to about $64,000 from $70,000.    Corporate cutbacks are fueling the spread of stock incentives, says Mr. Salwen of Mercer Meidinger. As many companies try to squeeze more productivity out of a smaller work force, &quot;they're giving more recognition to the fact that people lower down in the organization contribute to the bottom line.&quot;    This spring, Beneficial Corp., a consumer-finance company in Wilmington, Del., made all of its 6,600 workers eligible for stock options. The aim is to &quot;encourage more employees to take a greater interest in the success of the company,&quot; a spokesman says.    Some companies are granting options more freely in hopes of keeping good employees on board. Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc. extended its stock-option plan last year to &quot;several thousand employees, including many entry-level managers, who we feel have significant management potential,&quot; says Steven Kane, a vice president for human resources. Previously, only senior executives could receive options. Now, &quot;if we think someone has lots of talent, we want to get our hooks into them early.&quot;    The continuing heated takeover climate is another factor, says Peat Marwick's Mr. Chingos. Some companies are giving equity to more employees &quot;simply to get more stock in friendly hands.&quot; But some senior corporate executives are paying for that loyalty out of their own pockets: Because the number of company shares reserved for employee compensation is usually fixed -- and asking stockholders to approve increases can be touchy -- some executives are settling for fewer options than they used to get.    As with options, many companies are giving restricted stock -- traditionally reserved for top executives -- to a wider range of employees. In fact, Peat Marwick found that the drop in the median salary of those receiving restricted shares has been even sharper than that for options, to about $74,000 from $120,000 two years ago. Because restricted stock is actual equity, it is more valuable than stock options, even though employees usually can't sell the shares for three to five years after receiving them.    That difference was underlined by the market crash: Many options became worthless as share prices fell below option-exercise prices, but restricted-stock holders who suffered price declines still held securities that had some value. Since then, &quot;a lot of companies that were giving middle managers all options have started giving them some options and some restricted stock that doesn't place them as much at risk,&quot; Mr. Chingos says.    The stock market has dictated changes in compensation practices in the past. &quot;We've gone through periods when companies encouraged broader stock ownership,&quot; says Mr. Wolf of TPFandamp;C. &quot;Then we've hit market circumstances where that didn't work so well.&quot; But he adds that when companies give stock awards more broadly, they tend also to raise their job-performance expectations: &quot;They're looking for more ways to make sure the stock is earned.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
