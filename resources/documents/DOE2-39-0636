By this method, the local structure of an objectiveelement can be elucidated by measurement of the absorption coefficientof the X-ray absorption near edge without any pre-treating. The molybdenumcompound in the engine oils and the local structure around Mo atoms inthe decomposed compound after use were analyzed by measurement of theX-ray absorption spectra of the Mo-K absorption near-edge (EXAFS, XANES).The Mo atoms in the fresh engine oils are similar to that in the Mo-DTP(MoO, O-dialkyl phosphorodithioate) and the Mo compound in the oils haschanged to Mo oxide in which the Mo atoms are coordinated by six oxygenatoms after running. XANES spectra of the compounds show that the coordinationgeometry around Mo atoms in the Mo oxide are similar to that in MoO{sub3} rather than MoO{sub 2}. The deterioration of anti-friction effectof the engine oils after use coincides with Mo oxide formation. (10 figs,2 tabs, 25 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
