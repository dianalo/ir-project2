Juarez isa 13-week-old bald eagle that was the first of its kind to be released intothe wild through the zoo's breeding-for-release program. Still developing hisflying abilities, the young bird ventured from the island, but made it only asfar as a passing cargo vessel before making his landing. &quot;Obviously, Juarezwasn't quite ready to make this long flight,&quot; said the zoo's AvianConservation Center director, John Aikin. Since the young eagle was fittedwith a radio transmitter, he was easily tracked during his entire journey. OnMay 5, Juarez became the first bald eagle hatched at the San Francisco Zoo.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BALD EAGLE HITCHES RIDE ON CARGO SHIP  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Bay Area in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910811  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  152  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday August 11, 199100224008,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
