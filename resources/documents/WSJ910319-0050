Dallas-based Southwest said it was offering a one-way,unrestricted fare of $59 anywhere it flies within California.The fare, effective today, is fully refundable and availableon every seat.</LP><TEXT>   Southwest's traditional pricing strategy is to undercutits rivals. Just last week, it instituted special fare cutsin 11 of the 14 states it serves. This California move won'tcut too deeply in the Los Angeles-San Francisco corridor,where the lowest fare is $64, but it is sure to affect otherintra-California flights. UAL Inc.'s United Airlines said itwould match Southwest. Delta Air Lines Inc. and USAir saidthey were studying Southwest's move.   Southwest, which started moving aggressively intoCalifornia after USAir pulled back, plans to add about 10more flights there next month.</TEXT></DOC>
