Telephone: (202)732-7400.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>: In a continuing effort to improve theadministration of Department programs and service to the public, and inorder to reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary has identified certainprovisions of EDGAR that should be revised or removed. These provisionsare in addition to those published as final regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 24, 1987 (52 FR 27801).As with the earlier publication, the Secretary has identified opportunitiesto remove sections that are obsolete or not required by law. In addition,the Secretary proposes amendments to reflect the most efficient and cost-effectivemethod of making payments to grantees, in accordance with Treasury Circular1075 (31 CFR Part 205) and the Treasury Department mandate to replace letterof credit and Treasury check payments with more efficient electronic fundstransfers. The Secretary also proposes to make changes in the financialreporting requirements to reduce burden on grantees.Finally, the Secretary, recognizing the increase in the number of cooperativeagreements used by the Department and consistent with the rulemaking requirementsof the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) section 431, proposes torevise sections of EDGAR to establish requirements for the award and useof cooperative agreements under 31 U.S.C. Chapter 63.The Secretary is open to further suggestions for the deregulation of EDGARand is particularly interested in public comment on the award and administrationof cooperative agreements.The specific parts and sections proposed for revision are as follows:Section 74.3_The Secretary proposes to continue using general grant-makingprocedures to enter into cooperative agreements rather than establish anentirely new selection process for cooperative agreements. The Secretaryproposes to amend the definition of ``grant'' in andSection; 74.3 to include,specifically, cooperative agreements rather than relying on the fact thatthe current definition of ``grant'' covers all types of assistance relationships.However, the Secretary believes that some additional procedures are necessaryfor the administration of cooperative agreements. Therefore, the Secretaryproposes to add requirements for cooperative agreements in appropriateplaces throughout the regulations.Section 74.47_The Secretary proposes to amend this section to reflect thecodification of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 into Title31 of the U.S. Code, Chapter 65, and to reflect amendments to OMB CircularA-110 regarding income on advances made to grantees. Under the amendmentsto the Circular a grantee, other than a State as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6501,is required to hold advances in an interest-bearing account. Any interestover $100 per year must be paid to the Department. The exception in andSection;74.47(b) regarding interest earned by States does not apply to programssubject to section 487 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended(20 U.S.C. 1094).Sections 74.73, 74.74, 74.75, 74.76, 74.91, 74.93 and 74.96_The Secretaryproposes to revise these sections to reflect current procedures for financialreporting and to describe the most efficient and cost-effective methodof making payments to grantees, in accordance with Treasury Circular 1075(31 CFR Part 205) and other guidance provided by the Treasury Department.For example, the amendment to andSection; 74.91 would change the definitionof ``advance by Treasury check'' to ``advance'' to reflect the Secretary'sdiscretion to make advances through other methods authorized by the TreasuryCircular. The current regulations do not fully describe the kind of paymentmethods the Secretary may use to implement the requirements of the TreasuryCircular.Section 74.94_The Secretary proposes to remove this section because itis redundant with andSection; 74.93 as revised. Proposed andSection; 74.93would now cover payment methods for both construction and non-constructiongrants.Section 74.172_The Secretary proposes to revise this section because itis outdated. Currently, educational institutions follow the cost principlesfound in EDGAR, Part 74, Appendix D; these cost principles implement OMBCircular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions. However, in1979 and again in 1982, OMB revised Circular A-21. The Department has notyet implemented these changes in EDGAR. Additionally, OMB revised CircularA-21 on June 9, 1986, at 51 FR 20908, and on December 2, 1986, at 51 FR43487, to establish a fixed overhead allowance for the administration offederally sponsored grants and contracts at educational institutions. Thefixed allowance will equal 3.6 percent of modified total direct costs,and no faculty reporting will be required to support the allowance. Theseregulations amend EDGAR by revising Appendix D of Part 74 to include thecurrent provisions of OMB Circular A-21. These changes will permit theDepartment to ensure consistency with the government-wide requirementsof Circular A-21.Section 74.174_In recent years Congress has passed laws that make for-profitorganizations eligible for grants under some programs administered by theSecretary. The Department has no regulations that specify what cost principlesapply to these organizations when they receive grants. Therefore, the Secretaryproposes to apply the cost principles for commercial organizations whenthe Secretary makes a grant to a for-profit organization. These principlesalready apply, under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, to for-profitorganizations that enter into contracts with the Federal government (48CFR Part 31). The underlying principle that the Federal government shouldpay only for costs to assist a grant activity is not changed simply becausefor-profit organizations are made eligible. Thus, to ensure that the Departmentdoes not pay for costs that inure to the owners of a for-profit grantee,the proposed regulations would provide that no fee or other element aboveactual costs may be paid to a for-profit organization that receives a grantfrom the Department.Section 74.175_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to updatereferences that are obsolete due to legislative and regulatory changes.Sections 75.3 and 76.3_The Education Department General AdministrativeRegulations in 34 CFR Part 74 are referenced in each set of applicableprogram regulations. Thus, it is unnecessary to include the reference againin Parts 75 and 76 of EDGAR. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to removethese two sections.Section 75.4_The Secretary proposes to revise this section by updatingthe cross-reference to the regulations for contracts that will appear inTitle 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Sections 75.60 through 75.62_Consistent with the requirements of OMB CircularA-129, Managing Federal Credit Programs, dated May 9, 1985, the Secretaryproposes to add regulations making persons who are not current in repayingdebts owed to the Federal government ineligible to receive a fellowship,scholarship, or discretionary grant from the Department. In order to demonstratethe concern of the Secretary regarding the need for individuals to meettheir responsibilities under the programs of this Department, andSection;75.60 lists the current ED programs under which an individual might owea debt to the Department. The Department already has provisions in theregulations implementing the student financial assistance provisions ofTitle IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (Title IV), as amended, thatprohibit a student whose account under certain Title IV programs is notcurrent from receiving further financial assistance from the Department.While these procedures do not fully implement Circular A-129, they do reacha substantial portion of the debt owed to the Department. The requirementfor eligibility proposed in andSection; 75.60 would increase the Department'sability to ensure that individuals repay debts incurred under those TitleIV programs and the other programs listed in that section. The Secretarybelieves that an essential condition for an individual receiving a fellowship,scholarship, or discretionary grant is that the individual keep his orher account current as required under prior loan or grant conditions.This Department and twenty-six other agencies have published final andinterim final Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension regulations. Theseregulations permit debarment of an individual or organization that failedto pay a single substantial debt, or a number of outstanding debts, owedto any Federal agency or instrumentality, provided the debt is uncontestedby the debtor or, if contested, provided that the debtor's legal and administrativeremedies have been exhausted. Thus, the Department does not intend to makeawards to individuals debarred or suspended under Debarment and Suspensionregulations.Section 75.61 requires an applicant for a fellowship, scholarship, or directgrant to certify that he or she is eligible under andSection; 75.60, andnot debarred or suspended under regulations established under ExectiveOrder 12549. The fact that an award is made to an individual who has provideda certification required by andSection; 75.61 does not mean that the Secretaryhas concluded that the individual is eligible under andSection; 75.60. Ifan individual is not current in repaying debts owed to this Departmentor any other Federal agency, or has been debarred or suspended by thisDepartment or any other Federal agency, and fails to certify to those facts,the Secretary may proceed with a civil action to recover the funds madeavailable and may take other legal actions aganst the individual.The Secretary directly administers a number of fellowship and scholarshipprograms and a few programs where discretionary grants may be made to individuals.However, not all fellowship and scholarship programs are administered directlyby the Secretary. In some cases an institution of higher education maymake fellowships. Under other programs, a State or State educational Agencymay make awards after receiving funds on a formula or other basis. Sometimesthe Secretary awards a grant to the institution or organization makingthe awards; in other cases, the Secretary enters into an agreement withthe institution or organization. Whatever the nature of the programs involvingan institution of higher education, State educational agency, or otherintermediate entity, andSection; 75.62 is intended to apply to the entity,imposing minimal requirements to ensure that a fellowship or scholarshipis not provided to an individual who fails to keep his or her prior commitments.Section 75.62 requires that an entity to which the section applies obtaina certification from each individual who applies for a fellowship or scholarship.The certification, made under penalty of perjury, would state that theindividual is eligible under andSection; 75.60, and not debarred or suspendedunder regulations established under Executive Order 12549. If an applicantfailed to provide the certification or the entity is informed by the Secretarythat the applicant is ineligible, the entity would be prohibited from givingthe applicant a fellowship or scholarship. Section 75.62 also permits theSecretary to require that an entity subject to andSection; 75.62 submit alist of proposed or actual fellowship or scholarship recipients to theSecretary so the Secretary may verify the eligibility of these individuals.If the Secretary determines that an individual has provided a false certification,the Secretary may take appropriate legal action, including recovery ofany funds made available to the individual.The Secretary is interested in receiving comments on whether the Secretaryshould also apply the andSection; 75.60 eligibility provisions to programswhere the Secretary or an intermediate entity provides stipends to individuals.Finally, as a technical matter, the Secretary intends to have these regulationsapply to all fellowship and scholarship programs of the Department. However,some of the fellowship and scholarship programs do not apply Part 75 tothe program. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing in this document toamend the program regulations of those programs that do not apply Part75 to include a direct reference to these proposed new sections. The programregulations that are being amended for this purpose are the Christa McAuliffeFellowship Program (Part 237), the Indian Fellowship Program (Part 263),Handicapped Research: Research Fellowships (Part 356), Bilingual Education:Fellowship Program (Part 562), the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship Program(Part 653), and the Office of Educational Research and Improvement FellowsProgram (Part 762). Section 75.105(c)_The Secretary proposes to revise this section by addinglanguage to paragraph (c)(3) that clarifies how the competitive processworks when the Secretary announces absolute preference priorities.Sections 75.107, 75.108, 75.110, 75.111, 75.113, 75.114, 75.115, 75.116,and the note following andSection; 75.118_The Secretary proposes to removethese sections as burdensome and unnecessary. Section 75.110 is proposedfor removal because it duplicates provisions in standard forms requiredby OMB. Sections 75.111 and 75.113-75.116 are proposed for removal becausethey require applicants under direct formula grant programs to provideinformation not essential to determine funding under a formula grant program.OMB circulars and regulations of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 limit a Federal agency to collecting only that information whichhas practical utility to the agency in carrying out one of its functionsor which is required by law. See 5 CFR 1320.4 (b) and (c). Sections 75.107and 75.108 are proposed for removal as technical conforming amendments.The note following andSection; 75.118 is proposed for removal because itcontains a list of sections which are outdated.Sections 75.130 through 75.134_The Secretary proposes to remove these sections,which cover how the Secretary treats preapplications, and to place themin the program regulations of the program to which they now apply_the Fundfor the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE).Sections 75.150 through 75.154_The Secretary proposes to remove these sectionsas unnecessary because, at this time, there is no Department program thatcontains a requirement that a State must approve applications submittedto the program.Section 75.155_Under Executive Order 12372, the Department has establishedregulations in Part 79 that allow States to comment on Department programsand activities. Sections 75.156-75.158, which pre-date the Executive Order,also provided a procedure for States to comment on Department programs.The procedure was designed for use by Department programs that requiredState input either by statute or by regulation. The Secretary proposesto revise andSection;75.155 to limit the applicability of andSection;andSection;75.156-75.158to those programs that require State input by statute, and to add a cross-referenceregarding 34 CFR Part 79.Section 75.160_The Secretary proposes to remove this section as a conformingamendment to the removal of andSection;andSection;75.151 and 75.153.Section 75.200_The Federal Grant and Cooperative Act, now codified in Title31 of the U.S. Code, sections 6301-6309, authorizes the use of cooperativeagreements. At the time EDGAR was written, cooperative agreements werenot widely used by the Department, but since then the number of programrequests for using this award instrument has increased significantly. Theproposed change to andSection;75.200 implements the standards in the Actand OMB guidance, 43 FR 36860, August 18, 1978.Under the revised andSection;75.200, the Secretary may decide to use a cooperativeagreement if the Department will be substantially involved in the administrationof a particular assistance project. The key factor is whether the Secretarycan expect agency collaboration or participation in the management of theproject.Section 75.216_The Secretary proposes to revise this section so the Departmentno longer must return applications that are not evaluated under andSection;75.217or andSection;75.219. The change will reduce the cost to the Department ofmanaging grant competitions. The provision in paragraph (b) of this section,under which the Secretary informs an applicant that its application hasnot been evaluated, is proposed for consolidation with andSection;75.218which provides for notice to unfunded applicants.Section 75.218_The Secretary proposes to change the requirement in thissection that the Department explain reasons why an applicant was not selectedafter evaluation of its application. The Secretary currently sends a generalletter if an applicant is not selected and provides a detailed letter uponthe request of the applicant. The Secretary will continue to provide detailedinformation to applicants upon their request for that information. Thispolicy would also apply to applications that are not evaluated under andSection;75.216.Section 75.233_This section describes the factors the Secretary uses toset the amount of a grant. The Secretary proposes to make a technical revisionto this section by clarifying that the Federal share of allowable costsis subject to any applicable matching or cost-sharing requirements.Section 75.234_The Secretary proposes to revise this section, which describesconditions for making a grant, to include conditions required for a highrisk grantee, or the explicit nature of Federal involvement in a cooperativeagreement.Section 75.235_The Secretary proposes to revise paragraph (b) of this sectionto clarify that the Secretary includes in an award document any conditionsas necessary under specific program authority or to implement high riskor cooperative agreement requirements.Section 75.253_The Secretary proposes to clarify and strengthen the criteriafor making continuation awards for multi-year projects. The current regulations,among other criteria, require the Secretary to be ``satisfied that thegrantee will satisfactorily complete the budget period that is about toend.'' The Secretary strongly believes that recipients of Federal grantsshould be accountable for making effective use of the funds they receive,just as local school districts should be accountable for the effectivenessof the education they provide. The proposed regulations would require thata grantee either (1) be making substantial progress toward meeting theobjectives of its project, or (2) have obtained approval of changes inits project, at no additional cost to the Federal Government, that enablethe grantee to meet those objectives in succeeding budget periods. Whetherto approve any such proposed changes would be at the discretion of theSecretary. This revised provision should ensure that projects continuedin subsequent budget periods will be successful in meeting the goals ofthe affected Federal programs.Sections 75.253 and 75.261_The Secretary proposes to revise these sectionsto describe more fully the situations in which the Secretary has discretionto extend budget periods and project periods. Under andSection;75.703, agrantee may only obligate funds during the grant period. That period includesone or more approved budget periods within an authorized project period.However, if a grantee fails to receive a continuation award, the grantperiod ends with the last funded budget period. Thus, the grantee, in manycases, will not have obligated funds during that last budget period toprepare a final evaluation of the grant or to prepare closeout reports.The amendment to andSection;75.253 would permit the grantee to obligate fundsfor these purposes during an extension of the last budget period.This section is also amended to clarify the procedures the Secretary usesto make a continuation award. Section 75.261 is proposed for amendmentto make clear the Secretary's discretion to extend project periods in caseswhere the need for the extension is not predicated on facts pertinent solelyto an individual grantee. For example, Congress may not authorize fundsfor a particular program until sometime after the start of the fiscal year.In such a case, a group of grantees might have to delay the start of aproject or cease operations temporarily, delaying the expected completiondate for the grants. In this case, the Secretary may decide to extend theproject periods of these projects without receiving an individual requestfrom each grantee.Section 75.262_This section is added to specify the Secretary's authorityto convert a grant to a cooperative agreement, or to convert a cooperativeagreement to a grant, after considering the necessity to do so. The decisionto make a change in the type of award would be made after considering thefactors in proposed andSection;75.200(b) (4) and (5). This assessment woulddictate the type of award necessary to complete the project.Section 75.510_The Secretary proposes to remove this section, governingthe use of project directors, to reduce the intrusion of Federal regulationsin day-to-day management of the Department's grants. Given the fact that,in general, discretionary grant programs base selection of a grantee, inpart, on the quality of key personnel and that any change in key personnelmust be approved by ED, the Department has sufficient assurances that theconcerns addressed in this section are adequately met. Section 75.518_This section is a general reference to Federal laws thatmay establish the minimum wage. The Secretary proposes to remove this sectionbecause it it merely informative and has not substantive effect. Section 75.560(a)_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to updatereferences that are obsolete. Paragraph (a) of this section is revisedto refer to the cost principles in Parts 74 and 80 which describe the differencesbetween direct costs and indirect costs, and which include principles fordetermining the general indirect cost rate that a grantee may use for grantsunder most programs. Section 75.563 and 76.563_These sections currently provide illustrativelists of programs that have a statutory requirement not to use Federalfunds to supplant non-Federal funds. The Secretary has found that theselists have not been helpful in informing potential recipients about thesestatutory requirements. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to remove thelists and will inform recipients under direct grant programs through thegrant approval process, including the specification of restricted indirectcost rates in approved budgets. The Secretary will inform recipients underState-administered programs through approved State plans. Sections 75.580, 75.581, 76.580, and 76.581_The Secretary proposes to removethese sections in their entirety. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of andSection;andSection;75.580 and 76.580 were based on statutory requirements that are not obsolete.Furthermore, coordination with other activities in the same geographicarea served by the project is not necessary in all types of programs and,therefore, should not be a general requirement in EDGAR. Section 75.590_The Secretary proposes to remove the examples of personsbeing served by the project given in paragraph (c) of the current regulations.The grantee continues to be responsible for evaluating the effect of theproject on all participants. Section 75.608_The Secretary proposes to change the word ``shall'' to ``may''to permit a grantee discretion in the use of its facilities. Section 75.616_The Secretary proposes to revise the current standards forenergy efficiency to incorporate the most recent standards of the AmericanSociety of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers. Thisincorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the<T4> Federal Register</T4> pursuant to the Director's authority under 5U.S.C. 552(a). Section 75.617_The Secretary proposes to add a section to implement hisregulatory authority as required under the Coastal Barriers Resource Act.Section 75.622_The Secretary proposes to make a technical correction. Section 75.625_The cross-reference preceding this section refers to regulationsthat specify the Department's policy on inventions and patents. The contentof andSection; 75.625, which is also a cross-reference, would be incorporatedinto the existing cross-reference, and andSection; 75.625 would be removed.Section 75.626_Paragraph (b) of this section contains a reference to regulationsthat no longer exist. The Secretary proposes to remove paragraph (b) ofthis section to be consistent with OMB Circular A-124, Patents_Small BusinessFirms and Nonprofit Organizations. The Department no longer has an interest,as a general matter, in retaining rights to inventions and patents of granteesof the Department. In specific cases where the Department needs to protectits rights to inventions and patents, it may do so in the grant award document.Sections 75.681 and 76.681_The Secretary proposes to remove the cross-referencefollowing these sections. The cross-reference refers to regulations ofthe Department of Health and Human Services regarding the protection ofhuman research subjects. These regulations do not apply to Department ofEducation programs except as specifically provided in appropriate programregulations. Also, there is currently underway an initiative to establishgovernment-wide regulatory guidelines regarding the protection of humanresearch subjects. The Department will promulgate appropriate regulationsafter the general government-wide policy is established. See 51 FR 20204,June 1986. Sections 75.684 and 76.684_These sections on day-care services were originallyincluded in EDGAR as requirements of the former Department of Health, Education,and Welfare. However, the sections were used primarily to impose requirementsin welfare programs where funds were used specifically to establish daycare centers. The Secretary proposes to remove these sections because theyare not needed under the types of programs funded by the Department. Sections 75.690 and 76.690_These requirements regarding the inclusion ofeducational components on energy conservation awareness are not requiredby E.O. 12185. The Secretary proposes to remove these sections as a partof the Administration's regulatory burden-reduction effort. However, agrantee remains free to include these components, as appropriate, if desiredunder the grantee's own policies. Sections 75.707(h) and 76.707(h)_The Secretary proposed to update thesesections to refer to the sections in 34 CFR Part 74 that impose the appropriatecost principles on grantees of the Department. The Secretary also noteshis intention to address, in a future rulemaking document, issues regardingthe accountability of funds under section 437 of GEPA as those issues relateto this section and certain other sections of EDGAR. Sections 75.720 and 76.720_The Secretary proposes to limit the applicabilityof these sections to the financial status report required under andSection;74.73 and performance reports required under Subpart J of Part 74. UnderandSection;andSection; 75.720 and 76.720, as they currently stand, the Secretarymay only request financial and performance reports on an annual basis.Prior to 1980, when EDGAR became effective, the Department exercised discretionto require both performance and financial reports on a quarterly basis.At the time EDGAR was drafted, a general policy decision was made to limitperformance reports and certain financial reports (such as the financialstatus report) to an annual reporting cycle. However, there was no intentto limit collection of the Federal Cash Transactions Report to an annualbasis. For more than a decade, this report has been collected by this Departmentand its predecessor agencies on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis inorder to prevent excessive drawdowns by grantees. In order to clarify theDepartment's authority to collect these reports when necessary, the Secretaryproposes to limit the applicability of andSection;andSection; 75.720 and 76.720to the financial status reports and performance reports. Sections 75.740 and 76.740_The Secretary proposes to amend these sectionsto include references to the regulations protecting student rights in research,experimental programs, and testing. The requirements referenced in thesesections are codified at 34 CFR Part 98 and 99. Sections 75.750 through 75.755_The Secretary proposes to remove these sectionsbecause the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 changed the nature of reviewunder the paperwork control requirements in section 400A of the GEPA. Asa result, this Department currently screens documents under OMB regulationsat 5 CFR Part 1320 before final review and approval by OMB.Section 76.102_This section of EDGAR lists those documents to which theprovisions governing State plans in Part 76 of EDGAR apply. Since the listin andSection; 76.1, which contains the programs and their statutory authoritiesto which Part 76 applies, has been removed (52 FR 27801, July 24, 1987),the Secretary proposes to revise andSection; 76.102 by removing the cross-referenceto andSection; 76.1 at the end of the section and, as an aid to readers,by adding a reference to the statutory authority for each covered program.The Secretary also proposes to remove obsolete programs from the list andto add new programs to the list.Section 76.125_The table following this section is outdated. The Secretaryproposes to revise and update the table to reflect the programs administeredby the Department that the Secretary has determined are eligible for inclusionin the consolidated grant application process. Programs that are not presentlyfunded are not included in this list.Sections 76.300 and 76.305_The Secretary proposes to remove andSection; 76.305because it restricts the discretion of the States to establish simplerprocedures for amending a subgrant than were required for the approvalof the subgrant. Section 76.300 is revised to reflect this greater discretion.Section 76.401_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to reflectmore accurately the programs under which a State agency hearing is requiredbefore disapproval of an application.Section 76.560_The Secretary proposes to make technical corrections.Section 76.591_The Secretary proposes to make a technical correction.Sections 76.770 and 76.771_These sections currently contain detailed instructionsto the States on how to administer the programs subject to Part 76, particularlywith respect to subgrantees under those programs. The Secretary proposesto simplify and consolidate these sections into a revised andSection; 76.770,which would provide that a State must have procedures, for the administrationof these programs, that are designed to ensure compliance with applicablestatutes and regulations. It is not expected that the requirement beingretained would impose any significant burden, since the States should alreadyhave these procedures in place for administering the programs involved.Section 76.772_This section applies to the programs under Title IV of theElementary and Secondary Education Act. The Title IV authority has beenrepealed. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to remove this section.Sections 76.780-76.782_The Secretary proposes to remove these sectionsbecause they either do not apply to or have not been used under most programsof the Department. Most of these provisions were derived from the regulationsfor the State-administered program under Part B of the Education of theHandicapped Act (EHA). Those provisions of the State complaint procedurethat were derived from the regulations under the EHA are proposed for transferback to that program, which has shown the greatest need for the complaintprocedure.This action is not intended to implement the Augustus F. Hawkins_RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988,Pub. L. 100-297. The conference report for that legislation states Congress'intent that the Department apply the EDGAR complaint procedures to theChapter 1 program under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary EducationAct of 1965, as amended by Pub. L. 100-297.

Major considerationsinvolved in the determination of the reasonableness of a cost are: (a)whether or not the cost is of a type generally recognized as necessaryfor the operation of the institution of the performance of the sponsoredagreement; (b) the restraints or requirements imposed by such factors asarm's-length bargaining, Federal and State laws and regulations, and sponsoredagreement terms and conditions; (c) whether or not the individuals concernedacted with due prudence in the circumstances, considering their responsibilitiesto the institution, it employees, its students, the Government, and thepublic at large; and (d) the extent to which the actions taken with respectto the incurrence of the cost are consistent with established institutionalpolicies and practices applicable to the work of the institution generally,including sponsored agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Allocable costs.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost objective (i.e, a specificfunction, project, sponsored agreement, department, or the like) if thegoods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to such cost objectivein accordance with relative benefits received or other equitable relationship,Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a sponsored agreementif (1) it is incurred solely to advance the work under the sponsored agreement;(2) its benefits both the sponsored agreement and other work of the institution,in proportions that can be approximated through use of reasonable methods,or (3) it is necessary to the overall operation of the institution and,in light of the principles provided in this Circular, is deemed to be assignablein part to sponsored projects. Where the purchase of equipment or othercapital items is specifically authorized under a sponsored agreement, theamounts thus authorized for such purchases are assignable to the sponsoredagreement regardless of the use that may subsequently be made of the equipmentor other capital items involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Any costs allocable to a particular sponsored agreement under thestandards provided in this Circular may not be shifted to other sponsoredagreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or other fundconsiderations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by terms of thesponsored agreement, or for other reasons of convenience.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Applicable credits.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The term applicable credits refers to those receipts or negativeexpenditures that operate to offset or reduce direct or indirect cost items.Typical examples of such transactions are: purchase discounts, rebates,or allowances; recoveries or indemnites on losses; and adjustments of overpaymentsor erroneous charges. This term also includes ``educational discounts''on products or services provided specifically to educational institutions,such as discounts on computer equipment, except where the arrangement isclearly and explicitly identified as a gift by the vendor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Governmentto finance institutional activities or service operations should be treatedas applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credititems against related expenditures should be applied by the institutionin determining the rates or amounts to be charged to sponsored agreementsfor services rendered whenever the facilities or other resources used inproviding such services have been financed directly, in whole or in part,by Federal funds. (See Sections F8, J9a, and J38 for areas of potentialapplication in the matter of direct Federal financing.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Costs incurred by State and local governments.</T3> Costs incurredor paid by State or local governments on behalf of their colleges and universitiesfor fringe benefit programs such as pension costs and FICA and any othercosts specifically incurred on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, theinstitutions are allowable costs of such institutions whether or not thesecosts are recorded in the accounting records of the institutions, subjectto the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The costs meet the requirements of C1 through 5 above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The costs are properly supported by cost allocation plans in accordancewith applicable Federal cost accounting principles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by theFederal Government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Limitations on allowance of costs.</T3> Sponsored agreements may besubject to statutory requirements that limit the allowance of costs. Whenthe maximum amount allowable under a limitation is less than the totalamount determined in accordance with the principles in this Circular, theamount not recoverable under a sponsored agreement may not be charged toother sponsored agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">D. Direct Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>General.</T3> Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specificallywith a particular sponsored project, and instructional activity, or anyother institutional activity; or that can be directly assigned to suchactivities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Application to sponsored agreements.</T3> Identification with the sponsoredwork rather than the nature of the goods and services involved is the determiningfactor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs of sponsored agreements.Typical costs charged directly to a sponsored agreement are the compensationof employees for performance of work under the sponsored agreement, includingrelated fringe benefit costs to the extent they are consistently treated,in like circumstances, by the institution as direct rather than indirectcosts; the costs of materials consumed or expended in the performance ofthe work; and other items of expense incurred for the sponsored agreement,including extraordinary utility consumption. The cost of materials suppliedfrom stock or services rendered by specialized facilities or other institutionalservice operations may be included as direct costs of sponsored agreements,provided such items are consistently treated, in like circumstances, bythe institution as direct rather than indirect costs, and are charged undera recognized method of computing actual costs, and conform to generallyaccepted cost accounting practices consistently followed by the institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">E. Indirect Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>General.</T3> Indirect costs are those that are incurred for commonor joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specificallywith a particular sponsored project, and instructional activity, or anyother institutional activity. At educational institutions such costs normallyare classified under the following indirect cost categories: depreciationand use allowances, general administration expenses, sponsored projectsadministration expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, library expenses,departmental administration expenses, and student administration and services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Criteria for distribution.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Base period.</T3> A base period for distribution of indirect costsis the period during which the costs are incurred. The base period normallyshould coincide with the fiscal year established by the institution, butin any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequitiesin the distribution of costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Need for cost groupings.</T3> The overall objective of the indirectcost allocation process is to distribute the indirect costs described inSection F to the major functions of the institution in proportions reasonablyconsistent with the nature and extent of their use of the institution'sresources. In order to achieve this objective, it may be necessary to providefor selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of cost withinone or more of the indirect cost categories referred to in E1 above. Ingeneral, the cost groupings established within a category should constitute,in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to beof like nature in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree ofremoteness from) the particular cost objectives to which distribution isappropriate. Cost groupings should be established considering the generalguides provided in c below. Each such pool or cost grouping should thenbe distributed individually to the related cost objectives, used the distributionbase or method most appropriate in the light of the guides set forth ind below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>General considerations on cost groupings.</T3> The extent to whichseparate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriateat an institution is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-casebasis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two ormore separate cost groupings (based on account classification or analysis)within an indirect cost category include but are not limited to the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Where certain items or categories of expense relate solely toone of the major functions of the institution or to less than all functions,such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for directassignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides providedin E2b and d.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Where any types of expense ordinarily treated as general administrationor departmental administration are charged to sponsored agreements as directcosts, expenses applicable to other activities of the institution whenincurred for the same purposes in like circumstances must, through separatecost groupings, be excluded from the indirect costs allocable to thosesponsored agreements and included in the direct cost of other activitiesfor cost allocation purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Where it is determined that certain expenses are for the supportof a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurementon a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be setaside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to organizedresearch, instructional, and other activities at the institution or withinthe department.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Where activities provide their own purchasing, personnel administration,building maintenance or similar service, the distribution of general administrationand general expenses, or operation and maintenance expenses to such activitiesshould be accomplished through cost groupings which include only that portionof central indirect costs (such as for overall management) which are properlyallocable to such activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Where the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirectcharges, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost grouping forselective distribution to related cost objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) The number of separate cost groupings within a category shouldbe held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the materialityof the amounts involved and the degree of precision attainable throughless selective methods of distribution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Selection of distribution method.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting themethod or base to be used in distributing individual cost groupings. Theessential consideration in selecting a base is that it be the one bestsuited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordancewith benefits derived; a traceable cause and effect relationship; or logicand reason, where neither benefit nor cause and effect relationship isdeterminable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Where a cost grouping can be identified directly with the costobjective benefited, it should be assigned to that cost objective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Where the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature,the distribution may be based on a cost analysis study which results inan equitable distribution of the costs. Such cost analysis studies maytake into consideration weighting factors, population, or space occupiedif appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must (a) be appropriatelydocumented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by the cognizantFederal agency, (b) distribute the costs to the related cost objectivesin accordance with the relative benefits derived, (c) be statisticallysound, (d) be performed specifically at the institution at which the resultsare to be used, and (e) be reviewed periodically, but not less frequentlythan every two years, updated if necessary, and used consistently. Anyassumptions made in the study must be stated and explained. The use ofcost analysis studies and periodic changes in the method of cost distributionmust be fully justified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study doesnot result in an equitable distribution of the costs, the distributionshall be made in accordance with the appropriate base cited in SectionF., unless one of the following conditions is met: (a) it can be demonstratedthat the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocationof the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increasethe costs charged to sponsored agreements, or (b) the institution qualifiesfor, and elects to use, the simplified method for computing indirect costrates described in Section H.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Order of Distribution.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Indirect cost categories consist of depreciation and use allowance,operation and maintenance, general administration and general expenses,departmental administration, sponsored projects administration, library,and student administration and services, as described in Section F.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Depreciation and use allowances, operation and maintenance expenses,and general administrative and general expenses should be allocated inthat order to the remaining indirect cost categories as well as to themajor functions and specialized service facilities of the institution.Other cost categories may be allocated in the order determined to be mostappropriate by the institutions. When cross allocation of costs is madeas provided in (3) below, this order of allocation does not apply.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Normally an indirect cost category will be considered closed onceit has been allocated to their cost objectives, and costs may not be subsequentlyallocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or moreindirect cost categories may be used if such allocation will result ina more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, anappropriate modification to the composition of the indirect cost categoriesdescribed in Section F is required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">F. Identification and Assignment of Indirect Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Depreciation and use allowances.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs ofthe institution's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings,and equipment which are computed in accordance with Section J9.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section E2d,the expenses included in this category shall be allocated in the followingmanner:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Depreciation or use allowances on buildings used exclusively inthe conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipmentused in such buildings, shall be assigned to that function.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Depreciation or use allowances on buildings, used for more thanone function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings,shall be allocated to the individual functions performed in each buildingon the bais of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas suchas hallways, stairwells, and restrooms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Depreciation or use allowances on buildings and capital improvementswhere space is used jointly, and on equipment used jointly, shall be allocatedto benefiting functions in proportion to the total salaries and wages applicableto the joint functions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Depreciation or use allowances on buildings, capital improvements,and equipment used predominantly for one function and only incidentallyfor other(s), may be assigned to the function in which it is used predominantly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Depreciation or use allowances on certain capital improvementsto land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like,not included in the cost of buildings, shall be allocated to user categoriesof students and employees on a full-time equivalent basis.

Determination and Application of Indirect Cost Rate or Rates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Indirect cost pools. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Subject to b below, the separate categories of indirect costs allocatedto each major function of the institution as prescribed in Section f shallbe aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The amountin each pool shall be divided by the distribution base described in G2below to arrive at a single indirect cost rate for each function. The ratefor each function is used to distribute indirect costs to individual sponsoredagreements of that function. Since a common pool established for each majorfunction of the institution, a separate indirect cost rate would be establishedfor each of the major functions described in Section B1 under which sponsoredagreements are carried out. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In some instances a single rate basis for use across the boardon all work within a major function at an institution may not be appropriate.A single rate for research, for example, might not take into account thosedifferent environmental factors and other conditions which may affect substantiallythe indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of research at theinstitution. A particular segment of research may be that performed undera single sponsored agreement or it may consist of research under a groupor sponsored agreement performed in a common environment. The environmentalfactors are not limited to the physical location of the work. Other importantfactors are the level of the administrative support required, the natureof the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplinesor technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, orany combination thereof. Where a particular segment of a sponsored agreementis performed within an environment which appears to generate a significantlydifferent level of indirect costs, provision should be made for a separateindirect cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect costpool should be developed during the regular course of the rate determinationprocess and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom shouldbe utilized; provided it is determined that (1) such indirect cost ratediffers significantly from that which would have been obtained under a.above, and (2) the volume of work to which such rate would apply is materialin relation to other sponsored agreements at the institution. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>The distribution basis. </T3>Indirect costs shall be distributed toapplicable sponsored agreements on the basis of modified total direct costs,consisting of salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies,services, travel, and subgrants and subcontracts up to $25,000 each. Forthis purpose, an indirect cost rate should be determined for each of theseparate indirect cost pools developed pursuant to G1, above. The ratein each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of theparticular indirect cost pool is of the modified total direct costs identifiedwith such pool. Other bases may be used where it can be demonstrated thatthey produce more equitable results. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Negotiated lump sum for indirect costs. </T3>A negotiated fixed amountin lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate for self-contained, off-campus,or primarily subcontracted activities where the benefits derived from aninstitution's indirect services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiatedindirect costs will be treated as an offset before allocation to instruction,organized research, other sponsored activities, and other institutionalactivities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated shouldbe appropriately adjusted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs. </T3>Public Law 87-638(76 Stat. 437) authorizes the use of predetermined fixed rates in determiningthe indirect costs applicable under research agreements with educationalinstitutions. The stated objectives of the law are to simplify the administrationof cost-type research and development contracts (including grants) witheducational institutions, to facilitate the preparation of their budgets,and to permit more expeditious closeout of such contracts when the workis completed. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure,consideration should be given to the negotiation of predetermined fixedrates for indirect costs in those situations where the cost experienceand other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable theparties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable levelof indirect costs during the ensuing accounting period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions. </T3>When a fixedrate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or other time period),the over- or under-recovery for that year may be included as an adjustmentto the indirect cost for the next rate negotiation. When the rate is negotiatedbefore the carry-forward adjustment is determined, the carry-forward amountmay be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustmentsare to be made, each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given periodwill be computed by applying the expected indirect costs allocable to sponsoredagreements for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-forward adjustment(over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the forecast distributionbase. Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum agreements or cost-sharing provisionsor prior years shall not be carried forward for consideration in the newrate negotiation. There must, however, be an advance understanding in eachcase between the institution and the cognizant Federal agency as to whetherthese differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather thanmaking the determination after the differences are known. Further, institutionselecting to use this carry-forward provision may not subsequently changewithout prior approval of the cognizant Federal agency. In the event thatan institution returns to a postdetermined rate, any over- or under-recoveryduring the period in which negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisionswere followed will be included in the subsequent postdetermined rates.Where multiple rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable fordetermining each rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">H.

Where the total direct cost of work covered by this Circular atan institution does not exceed $3,000,000 in a fiscal year, the use ofthe simplified procedure described in 2, below, may be used in determiningallowable indirect costs. Under this simplified procedure, the institution'smost recent annual financial report and immediately available supportinginformation with salaries and wages segregated from other costs, will beutilized as a basis for determining the indirect cost rate applicable toall sponsored agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.

General Provisions for Selected Items of Cost</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sections 1 through 44 below provide principles to be applied in establishingthe allowability of certain items involved in determining cost. These principlesshould apply irrespective of whether a particular item of cost is properlytreated as direct cost or indirect cost. Failure to mention a particularitem of cost is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable;rather determination as to allowability in each case should be based onthe treatment provided for similar or related items of cost. In case ofa discrepancy between the provisions of a specific sponsored agreementand the provisions below, the agreement should govern.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Advertising costs.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising mediaand corollary administrative costs. Advertising media include magazines,newspapers, radio and television programs, direct mail, exhibits, and thelike.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The only advertising costs allowable are those which are solelyfor (1) the recruitment of personnel required for the performance by theinstitution of obligations arising under the sponsored agreement, whenconsidered in conjunction with all other recruitment costs, as set forthin Section J32; (2) the procurement of goods and services for the performanceof the sponsored agreement; (3) the disposal of scrap or surplus materialsacquired in the performance of the sponsored agreement except when institutionsare reimbursed for disposal costs at a predetermined amount in accordancewith Attachment N, OMB Circular No. A-110; or (4) other specific purposesnecessary to meet the requirements of the sponsored agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Costs of this nature, if incurred for more than one sponsored agreementor for both sponsored work and other work of the institution, are allowableto the extent that the principles in Sections D and E are observed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Bad debts.</T3> Any losses, whether actual or estimated, arising fromuncollectible accounts and other claims, related collections costs, andrelated legal costs, are unallowable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Civil defense costs</T3>. Civil defense costs are those incurred inplanning for, and the protection of life and property against, the possibleeffects of enemy attack. Reasonable costs of civil defense measures (includingcosts in excess of normal plant protection costs, first-aid training andsupplies, firefighting training, posting of additional exit notices anddirections, and other approved civil defense measures) undertaken on theinstitutions' premises pursuant to suggestions or requirements of civildefense authorities are allowable when distributed to all activities ofthe institution. Capital expenditures for civil defense purposes will notbe allowed, but a use allowance or depreciation may be permitted in accordancewith provisions set forth in Section J9. Costs of local civil defense projectsnot on the institution's premises are unallowable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Commencement and convocation costs</T3>. Costs incurred for commencementsand convocations are unallowable, except as provided for in Section F7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Communication costs</T3>. Costs incurred for telephone services, localand long distance telephone calls, telegrams radiograms, postage and thelike, are allowable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">6. Compensation for personal services</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>General. </T3>Compensation for personal services covers all amountspaid currently or accrued by the institution for services of employeesrendered during the period of performance under sponsored agreements. Suchamounts include salaries, wages, and fringe benefits (See Section J15.).These costs are allowable to the extent that the total compensation toindividual employees conforms to the established policies of the institution,consistently applied, and provided that the charges for work performeddirectly on sponsored agreements and for other work allocable as indirectcosts are determined and supported as provided below. Charges to sponsoredagreements may include reasonable amounts for activities contributing andintimately related to work under the agreements, such as delivering speciallectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reportsand articles, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleaguesand graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences. Incidentalwork (that in excess of normal for the individual), for which supplementalcompensation is paid by an institution under institutional policy, neednot be included in the payroll distribution systems described below, providedsuch work and compensation are separately identified and documented inthe financial management system of the institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.(1) <T3>General Principles. </T3>(a) The distribution of salaries and wageswhether treated as direct or indirect costs, will be based on payrollsdocumented in accordance with the generally accepted practices of collegesand universities. Institutions may include in a residual category all activitiesthat are not directly charged to sponsored agreements, and that need notbe distributed to more than one activity for purposes of identifying indirectcosts and the functions to which they are allocable. The components ofthe residual category are not required to be separately documented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The apportionment of employee's salaries and wages which are chargeableto more than one sponsored agreement or other cost objective will be accomplishedby methods which will (1) be in accordance with Sections A-2 and C above,(2) produce an equitable distribution of charges for employee's activities,and (3) distinguish the employees' direct activities from their indirectactivities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) In the use of any methods for apportioning salaries, it is recognizedthat, in an academic setting, teaching, research, service, and administrationare often inextricably intermingled. A precise assessment of factors thatcontribute to costs is not always feasible, nor is it expected. Reliance,therefore, is placed on estimates in which a degree of tolerance is appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) There is no single best method for documenting the distributionof charges for personal services. Methods for apportioning salaries andwages, however, must meet the criteria specified in J.6.b.(2) below. Examplesof acceptable methods are contained in J.6.c. below. Other methods whichmeet the criteria specified in J.6.b.(2) below also shall be deemed acceptable,if a mutually satisfactory alternative agreement is reached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Criteria for Acceptable Methods. </T3>(a) The payroll distributionsystem will (i) be incorporated into the official records of the institution,(ii) reasonably reflect the activity for which the employee is compensatedby the institution, and (iii) encompass both sponsored and all other activitieson an integrated basis, but may include the use of subsidiary records.(Compensation for incidental work described in J.6.a. need not be included.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The method must recognize the principle of after-the-fact confirmationor determination so that costs distributed represent actual costs, unlessa mutually satisfactory alternative agreement is reached. Direct cost activitiesand indirect cost activities may be confirmed by responsible persons withsuitable means of verification that the work was performed. Confirmationby the employee is not a requirement for either direct or indirect costactivities if other responsible persons make appropriate confirmations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The payroll distribution system will allow confirmation of activityallocable to each sponsored agreement and each of the categories of activityneeded to identify indirect costs and the functions to which they are allocable.The activities chargeable to indirect cost categories or the major functionsof the institution for employees whose salaries must be apportioned (seeJ.6.b.1.(b) above), if not initially identified as separate categories,may be subsequently distributed by any reasonable method mutally agreedto, including, but not limited to, suitably conducted surveys, statisticalsampling procedures, or the application of negotiated fixed rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Practices vary among institutions and within institutions as tothe activity constituting a full workload. Therefore, the payroll distributionsystem may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distributionof total activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) Direct and indirect charges may be made initially to sponsoredagreements on the basis of estimates made before services are performed.When such estimates are used, significant changes in the correspondingwork activity must be identified and entered into the payroll distributionsystem. Short-term (such as one or two months) fluctuation between workloadcategories need not be considered as long as the distribution of salariesand wages is reasonable over the longer term, such as an academic period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) The system will provide for independent internal evaluations toensure the system's effectiveness and compliance with the above standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) For systems which meet these standards, the institution will notbe required to provide additional support or documentation for the effortactually performed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Examples of Acceptable Methods for Payroll Distribution:</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Plan_Confirmation: </T3>Under this method, the distribution of salariesand wages of professorial or professional staff applicable to sponsoredagreements is based on budgeted, planned, or assigned work activity, updatedto reflect any significant changes in work distribution. A plan-confirmationsystem used for salaries and wages charged directly or indirectly to sponsoredagreements will meet the following standards:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) A system of budgeted, planned, or assigned work activity willbe incorporated into the official records of the institution and encompassboth sponsored and all other activities on an integrated basis. The systemmay include the use of subsidiary records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The system will reasonably reflect only the activity for whichthe employee is compensated by the institution (compensation for incidentalwork described in J.6.a. need not be included). Practices vary among institutionsand within institutions as to the activity constituting a full workload.Hence, the system will reflect categories of activities expressed as apercentage distribution of total activities. (But see Section H for treatmentof indirect costs under the simplified method for small institutions.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The system will reflect activity applicable to each sponsoredagreement and to each category needed to identify indirect costs and thefunctions to which they are allocable. The system may treat indirect costactivities initially within a residual category and subsequently determinethem by alternate methods as discussed in J.6.b.(2)(c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The system will provide for modification of an individual's salaryor salary distribution commensurate with an significant change in the employee'swork activity. Short-term (such as one or two months) fluctuation betweenworkload categories need not be considered as long as the distributionof salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term such as an academicperiod. Whenever it is apparent that a significant change in work activitywhich is directly or indirectly charged to sponsored agreements will occuror has occurred, the change will be documented over the signature of aresponsible official and entered into the system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) At least annually a statement will be signed by the employee,principal investigator, or responsible official(s) using suitable meansof verification that the work was performed, stating that salaries andwages charged to sponsored agreements as direct charges, and to residual,indirect cost or other categories are reasonable in relation to work performed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) The system will provide for independent internal evaluation toensure the system's integrity and compliance with the above standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) In the use of this method, an institution shall not be requiredto provide additional support or documentation for the effort actuallyperformed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>After-the-fact Activity Records: </T3>Under this system the distributionof salaries and wages by the institution will be supported by activityreports as prescribed below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Activity reports will reflect the distribution of activity expendedby employees covered by the system (compensation for incidental work asdescribed in J.6.a. need not be included).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) These reports will reflect an after-the-fact reporting of thepercentage distribution of activity of employees. Charges may be made initiallyon the basis of estimates made before the services are performed, providedthat such charges are promptly adjusted if significant differences areindicated by activity records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Reports will reasonably reflect the activities for which employeesare compensated by the institution. To confirm that the distribution ofactivity represents a reasonable estimate of the work performed by theemployee during the period, the reports will be signed by the employee,principal investigator, or responsible official(s) using suitable meansof verification that the work was performed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The system will reflect activity applicable to each sponsoredagreement and to each category needed to identify indirect costs and thefunctions to which they are allocable. The system may treat indirect costactivities initially within a residual category and subsequently determinethem by alternate methods as discussed in J.6.b.(2)(c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) For professorial and professional staff, the reports will be preparedeach academic term, but no less frequently than every six months. For otheremployees, unless alternate arrangements are agreed to, the reports willbe prepared no less frequently than monthly and will coincide with oneor more pay periods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) Where the institution uses time cards or other forms of after-the-factpayroll documents as original documentation for payroll and payroll charges,such documents shall qualify as records for this purpose provided thatthey meet the requirements in (a) through (e) above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Multiple Confirmation Records: </T3>Under this system the distributionof salaries and wages of professorial and professional staff will be supportedby records which certify separately for direct and indirect cost activitiesas prescribed below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) For employees covered by the system, there will be direct costrecords to reflect the distribution of that activity expended which isto be allocable as direct cost to each sponsored agreement. There willalso be indirect cost records to reflect the distribution of that activityto indirect costs. These records may be kept jointly or separately (butare to be certified separately, see below).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Salary and wage charges may be made initially on the basis ofestimates made before the services are performed provided that such chargesare promptly adjusted if significant differences occur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Institutional records will reasonably reflect only the activityfo which employees are compensated by the institution (compensation forincidental work as described in J.6.a. need not be included).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The system will reflect activity applicable to each sponsoredagreement and to each category needed to identify indirect costs and thefunctions to which they are allocable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) To confirm that distribution of activity represents a reasonableestimate of the work performed by the employee during the period, the recordfor each employee will include:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The signature of the employee or of a person having direct knowledgeof the work, confirming that the record of activities allocable as directcosts of each sponsored agreement is appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The record of indirect costs will include the signature of responsibleperson(s) who use suitable means of verification that the work was performedand is consistent with the overall distribution of the employee's compensatedactivities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These signatures may all be on the same document. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) The reports will be prepared each academic term, but no less frequentlythan every six months. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) Where the institution uses time cards or other forms of after-the-factpayroll documents as original documentation for payroll and payroll charges,such documents shall qualify as records for this purpose provided theymeet the requirements in (a) through (f) above. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Salary rates for faculty members</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Salary rates for academic year. </T3>Charges for work performed onsponsored agreements by faculty members during the academic year will bebased on the individual faculty member's regular compensation for the continuousperiod which, under the policy of the institution concerned, constitutesthe basis of his salary. Charges for work performed on sponsored agreementsduring all or any portion of such period are allowable at the base salaryrate. In no event will charges to sponsored agreements, irrespective ofthe basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the base salaryfor that period. This principle applies to all members of the faculty atan institution. Since intra-university consulting is assumed to be undertakenas a university obligation requiring no compensation in addition to full-timebase salary, the principle also applies to faculty members who functionas consultants or otherwise contribute to a sponsored agreement conductedby another faculty member of the same institution. However, in unusualcases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separateor remote operation, and the work performed by the consultant is in additionto his regular departmental load, any charges for such work representingextra compensation above the base salary are allowable provided that suchconsulting arrangements are specifically provided for in the agreementor approved in writing by the sponsoring agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Periods outside the academic year.</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Except as otherwise specified for teaching activity in (b) below,charges for work performed by faculty members on sponsored agreements duringthe summer months or other period not included in the base salary periodwill be determined for each faculty member at a rate not in excess of thebase salary divided by the period to which the base salary relates, andwill be limited to charges made in accordance with other parts of thissection. The base salary period used in computing charges for work performedduring the summer months will be the number of months covered by the facultymember's official academic year appointment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members onsponsored agreements during the summer months or other periods not includedin the base salary period will be based on the normal policy of the institutiongoverning compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments duringsuch periods. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Part-time faculty.</T3> Charges for work performed on sponsored agreementsby faculty members having only part-time appointments will be determinedat a rate not in excess of that regularly paid for the part-time assignments;e.g., an institution pays $5,000 to a faculty member for half-time teachingduring the academic year. He devoted one-half of his remaining time toa sponsored agreement. Thus, his additional compensation, chargeable bythe institution to the agreement, would be one-half of $5,000, or $2,500.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>Noninstitutional professional activities.</T3> Unless an arrangementis specifically authorized by a Federal sponsoring agency, an institutionmust follow its institution-wide policies and practices concerning thepermissible extent of professional services that can be provided outsidethe institution for noninstitutional compensation. Where such institution-widepolicies do not exist or do not adequately define the permissible extentof consulting or other noninstitutional activities undertaken for extraoutside pay, the Government may require that the effort of professionalstaff working on sponsored agreements be allocated between (1) institutionalactivities, and (2) noninstitutional professional activities. If the sponsoringagency considers the extent of noninstitutional professional effort excessive,appropriate arrangements governing compensation will be negotiated on acase-by-case basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Contingency provisions. </T3>Contributions to a contingency reserveor any similar provision made for events, the occurrence of which cannotbe foretold with certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assuranceof their happening, are unallowable. (But see also Section J16c.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Deans of faculty and graduate schools. </T3>The salaries and expensesof deans of faculty and graduate schools, or their equivalents, and theirstaffs, are allowable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Depreciation and use allowances.</T3> Institutions may be compensatedfor the use of their buildings, capital improvements, and equipment; providedthat they are used, needed in the institutions' activities, and properlyallocable to sponsored agreements. Such compensation shall be made by computingeither depreciation or use allowance. Use allowances are the means of providingsuch compensation when depreciation or other equivalent costs are not computed.The allocation for depreciation or use allowance shall be made in accordancewith Section F1. Depreciation and use allowances are computed applyingthe following rules:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The computation of depreciation or use allowances shall be basedon the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For this purpose, the acquisitioncost will exclude (1) the cost of land; (2) any portion of the cost ofbuildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Government, irrespectiveof where title was originally vested or where it is presently located;and (3) any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributedby or for the institution where law or agreement prohibit recovery. Foran asset donated to the institution by a third party, its fair market valueat the time of the donation shall be considered as the acquisition cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. In the use of the depreciation method, the following shall be observed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in eachcase for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factorsas type of construction, nature of the equipment, technological developmentsin the particular area, and the renewal and replacement policies followedfor the individual items or classes of assets involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (orgroup of assets) to accounting periods shall reflect the pattern of consumptionof the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicatingthat the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greaterin the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, thestraightline method shall be presumed to be the appropriate method. Depreciationmethods once used shall not be changed unless appoved in advance by thecognizant Federal agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Where the depreciation method is introduced for application toassets for which use allowance was previously charged, the aggregate amountof use allowances and depreciation applicable to such assets must not exceedthe total acquisition cost of the assets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) When the depreciation method is used for buildings, a building``shell'' may be treated separately from other building components, suchas plumbing system and heating and air conditioning system. Each componentitem may then be depreciated over its estimated useful life. On the otherhand, the entire building, including the shell and all components, maybe treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Where the depreciation method is used for a particular class ofassets, no depreciation may be allowed on any such assets that have outlivedtheir depreciable lives. (But see also c(3), below.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Under the use allowance method, the following shall be observed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The use allowance for buildings and improvements (including improvementssuch as paved parking areas, fences, and sidewalks) will be computed atan annual rate not exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowancefor equipment will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six andtwo-thirds percent of acquisition cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) In contrast to the depreciation method, the entire building mustbe treated as a single asset without separating its ``shell'' from otherbuilding components under the use allowance method. The entire buildingmust be treated as a single asset, and the two-percent use allowance limitationmust be applied to all parts of the building. The two-percent limitation,however, need not be applied to equipment or other assets that are merelyattached or fastened to the building but not permanently fixed and areused as furnishings, decorations or for specialized purposes (e.g., dentistchairs and dental treatment units, counters, laboratory benches boltedto the floor, dishwashers, and carpeting). Such equipment and assets willbe considered as not being permanently fixed to the building if they canbe removed without the need for costly or extensive alterations or repairsto the building to make the space usable for other purposes. Equipmentand assets which meet these criteria will be subject to the six and two-thirdspercent equipment use allowance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) A reasonable use allowance may be negotiated for any assets thatare considered to be fully depreciated, after taking into considerationthe amount of depreciation previously charged to the Government, the estimateduseful life remaining at the time of negotiation, the effect of any increasedmaintenance charges, decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factorspertinent to the utilization of the asset for the purpose contemplated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Except as otherwise provided in b and c above, a combination ofthe depreciation and use allowance methods may not be used, in like circumstances,for a single class of assets (e.g., buildings, office equipment, and computerequipment).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Charges for use allowances or depreciation must be supported byadequate property records, and physical inventories must be taken at leastonce every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used,and needed. Statistical sampling techniques may be used in taking theseinventories. In addition, when the depreciation method is used, adequatedepreciation records showing the amount of depreciation taken each periodmust also be maintained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>Donated services and property. </T3>The value of donated services andproperty are not allowable either as a direct or indirect cost, exceptthat depreciation or use allowances on donated assets are permitted inaccordance with Section J9a. The value of donated services and propertymay be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirements, in accordancewith OMB Circular No. A-110.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. <T3>Employee morale, health, and welfare costs and credits. </T3>The costsof house publications, health or first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries,recreational activities, employees, counseling services, and other expensesincurred in accordance with the institution's established practice or customfor the improvement of working conditions, employer-employee relations,employee morale, and employee performance, are allowable. Income generatedfrom any of these activities will be credited to the cost thereof unlesssuch income has been irrevocably set over to employee welfare organizations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. <T3>Entertainment costs. </T3>Costs incurred for amusement, social activities,entertainment, and any items relating thereto, such as meals, lodging,rentals, transportation, and gratuities, are unallowable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. <T3>Equipment and other capital expenditures.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Equipment </T3>means an article of nonexpendable tangible personalproperty having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisitioncost of $500 or more per unit. However, consistent with institutional policy,lower limits may be established.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Capital expenditure </T3>means the cost of the asset including thecost to put it in place. Capital expenditure for equipment, for example,means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of anymodifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessaryto make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired. Ancillary charges,such as taxes, duty, protective intransit insurance, freight, and installationmay be included in, or excluded from, capital expenditure cost in accordancewith the institution's regular accounting practices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Special purpose equipment </T3>means equipment which is used only forresearch, medical, scientific, or other technical activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>General purpose equipment </T3>means equipment, the use of which isnot limited only to research, medical, scientific or other technical activities.Examples of general purpose equipment include office equipment and furnishings,air conditioning equipment, reproduction and printing equipment, motorvehicles, and automatic data processing equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The following rules of allowability shall apply to equipment andother capital expenditures: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings,and the land are unallowable as direct charges, except where approved inadvance by the sponsoring agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Capital expenditures for special purpose equipment are allowableas direct charges, provided that the acquisition of items having a unitcost of $1,000 or more is approved in advance by the sponsoring agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipmentwhich materially increase their value or useful life are unallowable asdirect charges, except where approved in advance by the sponsoring agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Capital expenditures are unallowable as indirect costs. But seeSection J9 for allowability of depreciation or use allowance on buildings,capital improvements, and equipment. Also see Section J33 for allowabilityof rental costs on land, buildings, and equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. <T3>Fines and penalties. </T3>Costs resulting from violations of, or failureof the institution to comply with Federal, State, and local laws and regulationsare unallowable, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specificprovisions of the sponsoring agreement, or instructions in writing fromthe contracting officer or equivalent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">15. <T3>Fringe benefits. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employeesduring periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annualleave, sick leave, military leave, and the like, are allowable, providedsuch costs are distributed to all institutional activities in proportionto the relative amount of time or effort actually devoted by the employees.see Section J35 for treatment of sabbatical leave. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expensesfor social security, employee insurance, workmen's compensation insurance,tuition or remission of tuition for individual employees or their familiesand the like are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordancewith established institutional policies, and are distributed to all institutionalactivities on an equitable basis. See Section J36b for treatment of tuitionremission provided to students. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Rules for pension plan costs are as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Costs of the institution's pension plan which are incurred inaccordance with the established policies of the institution are allowable,provided (a) such policies meet the test of reasonableness; (b) the methodsof cost allocation are equitable for all activities; (c) the amount ofpension cost assigned to each fiscal year is determined in accordance with(2) below; and (d) the cost assigned to a given fiscal year is paid orfunded for all plan participants within six months after the end of thatyear. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The amount of pension cost assigned to each fiscal year shallbe determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Institutions may elect to follow the ``Cost Accounting Standard for Compositionand Measurement of Pension Cost'' (4 CFR Part 412). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Premiums paid for pension plan termination insurance pursuantto the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-406)are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excisetaxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and prohibited transactions ofpension plan fiduciaries imposed under the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct are also unallowable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Fringe benefit may be assigned to cost objectives by identifyingspecific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating onthe basis of the salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits.When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made toselective groupings of employees, if the costs in relationship to salariesand wages differ significantly for different groups of employees. Alsofringe benefits related to institutional salaries and wages treated asdirect costs may be treated as direct costs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">16. <T3>Insurance and indemnification. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Costs of insurance required or approve, and maintained, pursuantto the sponsored agreement, are allowable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Costs of other insurance maintained by the institution in connectionwith the general conduct of its activities, are allowable subject to thefollowing limitations: (1) types and extent and cost of coverage must bein accordance with sound institutional practice; (2) costs of insuranceor of any contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of ordamage to Government-owned property are unallowable, except to the extentthat the Government has specifically required or approved such costs; and(3) costs of insurance on the lives of officers or trustees are unallowableexcept where such insurance is part of an employee plan which is not undulyrestricted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.
