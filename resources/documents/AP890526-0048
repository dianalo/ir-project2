(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Technicians today prepared a Delta 2for its fifth launch attempt as troubleshooters studied anelectrical problem that stopped the rocket a second before liftoff.   Air Force officials predict it will be at least Wednesday beforethey try again to launch the $20 million Delta 2, which is to carrya military navigation satellite into orbit for the United Statesand its allies.   Experts concluded Thursday that an electrical problem at thelaunch pad caused a computer to shut down the main engine of theDelta 2. Engineers investigating the aborted launch ``determinedthat its cause is most likely an electrical problem and (they)highly suspect ground equipment,'' said Capt. Ken Warren, an AirForce spokesman.   A team of engineers from the Air Force and the rocket's maker,McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. of Huntington Beach, Calif., wasassembled after the scrubbed takeoff Wednesday night of the Delta 2and its $65 milion payload, a Navstar Global Positioning Satellite.   A source who requested anonymity said experts found nothingwrong with the rocket and are investigating the possibility thatthunderstorms, which forced three previous launch postponements,may have caused a problem in the launch pad's circuitry.   Officials said a valve stuck shut and starved the Delta 2's mainengine of liquid oxygen, which mixes with a kerosene-type fuel topropel the rocket. A computer discovered the closed valve and shutthe engine off before it could ignite.   Launch controllers had sent an engine ignition command, but itnever reached the fuel valve. An open electrical circuit apparentlyblocked the command, according to a source.   The Navstar satellite will tell U.S. and allied military unitstheir location within 50 feet _ on land, at sea, or in the air _anywhere on the globe. Launch attempts on Saturday, Sunday andTuesday were scrubbed.</TEXT></DOC>
