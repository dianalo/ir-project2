Inc. and seven investors have agreed to surrender profits andpay fines totaling nearly $1.8 million for alleged insider trading,the Securities and Exchange Commission says.   The federal agency filed a complaint Monday in U.S. DistrictCourt accusing Glenn Golenberg of suburban Pepper Pike, presidentand owner of Golenberg andamp; Co. of Cleveland, of telling outsidersthat management was considering a debt-financed takeover of thecompany before the plan was announced three years ago.   The SEC said it was the first time an individual was fined forviolations of insider trading regulations without having made anytrades.   Seven people or their clients eventually earned a total of$735,000 by trading in Revco stock, the SEC said. Federalsecurities laws prohibit trading stocks based on non-publicinformation.   The defendants have agreed to repay their profits and nearly $1million in fines, without admitting or denying guilt, the SEC said.   The SEC said Golenberg agreed to pay a $470,000 penalty andconsented to an SEC order barring him from acting as a broker,dealer or investment adviser for at least four years.   The Twinsburg-based Revco was purchased through a management-ledtakeover known as a leveraged buyout that was financed mostly withborrowed money. The company filed for bankruptcy protection lastJuly because it couldn't pay its $1.5 billion debt. No other largeleveraged buyout has run into such serious debt trouble.   Kathleen Obert, a Revco spokeswoman, said Golenberg is a Revcoboard member because of his stock holdings, amounting to 150,000Revco shares as of last May 28.   ``Revco was the biggest deal of my life,'' he said in astatement after the SEC filed the complaint. ``It was constantly onmy mind, something I lived and breathed. Regrettably, I talkedabout it with a few people who did not have any right to know whatwas going on. I now realize the seriousness of that lapse ofjudgment.''   In the same complaint, the SEC accused Golenberg of providinginformation to Steve S. Saltzman of Cleveland about the proposedmerger of two smaller firms, Magnetics International Inc. of MapleHeights and H.K. Porter Inc. Saltzman made $6,850 buying andselling 2,000 shares of Magnetics common stock and made $27,326purchasing and selling Revco stock, the SEC said. Saltzman agreedto repay the money and an equal fine.   ``I should have known better,'' Golenberg said of the portion ofthe complaint dealing with Magnetics.   Ms. Obert declined to comment on Golenberg's settlement, saying``that's entirely between the SEC and Mr. Golenberg.'' She said thecompany has prepared a five-year business plan for reorganizationbut it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy court yet.   The other investors accused in the complaint of profiting frominside information about the Revco buyout, are:   _Bernard Shavitz of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., a business associateof Golenberg's. The SEC said Shavitz made $214,000 buying andselling Revco stock and is asking that Shavitz repay the moneyalong with a fine of $214,000.   _Van S. Weinberg of Memphis, Tenn., described as a friend ofGolenberg's. Weinberg is accused of earning $65,000 trading Revcostock and leaking inside information to the remaining defendants.The SEC required him to surrender the profits and a pay a $75,000fine.   _Stephen Lightman of Memphis, accused of earning $215,218trading Revco stock. He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.   _Lawrence S. Adler of Memphis, an account executive with theformer E.F. Hutton Group Inc., is accused of earning $38,188 forhimself and $141,820 for clients. He agreed to pay $180,008 inillicit profits and a $19,992 fine.   _Ray H.
