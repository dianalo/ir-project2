Ford also issued $150 million of 8.2% non-callable notes due July 1, 1990. Those notes are priced at 99.931 to yield 8.275% and are underwritten by Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    Bear Stearns also is underwriting the Ford warrants and recently sold a similar yen-linked issue on behalf of General Electric Credit Corp. The securities, called currency exchange warrants, are traded on the American Stock Exchange. Ford issued three million warrants priced at $4.375 each, trading under the symbol FY.WS.    Ford will redeem the warrants at a rate pegged to the yen. If the dollar rises above a breakeven price of about 166 yen, the investment appreciates. If the dollar falls against the yen, the warrant declines in value. Investors can buy and sell the warrants, or redeem them for their cash value from Ford before July 1, 1992, when they will be automatically exercised.    The warrants will have a cash settlement value only if the dollar is worth more than 152.2 yen.    The security provides a relatively long-term foreign-currency investment. The longest foreign-exchange option issued is one year. </TEXT></DOC>
