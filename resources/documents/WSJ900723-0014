The service tax will add $223 million a year to the $2billion raised from the existing 5% sales tax, which nowaccounts for 22% of the state's total tax revenue.</LP><TEXT>   While not the first of its kind in the nation,Massachusetts's newly adopted service tax is the broadest ofany major industrial state. And it is the boldest step towardtaxing services since Florida repealed its tax three yearsago, after vociferous protests and threats by some businessesto pull out of the state.   It is inevitable, tax experts say, that many states willconsider following Massachusetts' lead. &quot;There seemed to be alull after Florida, and now it appears that states are takinganother look at broadening the sales-tax base,&quot; says CorinaEckl, a tax specialist at the National Conference of StateLegislatures, a research group.   Last month, New Jersey decided to raise additional revenueby taxing, among other things, a number of services includingtelecommunications and janitorial services. And last year,Connecticut extended its sales-tax base to 21 services, frompublic relations to landscaping and window cleaning.   &quot;I'm receiving more and more calls from legislators andlegislative staff assistants with inquiries about taxingservices,&quot; says Ronald Schreiner, secretary of the Departmentof Revenue for South Dakota, which long has taxed services inthe state.   Fiscal deterioration in many states -- as in Massachusetts-- and the fact that the nation's economy is becoming moreand more service-oriented are catalysts spurring legislaturesto move toward taxing services, experts say. &quot;The question isbound to pop up in legislatures every time somebody needsmoney,&quot; says Hal Hovey, editor of State Budget and Tax Newsin Alexandria, Va. &quot;As states look for new tax bases,services consumed by individuals will be up for inspectionbefore the more sensitive issue of corporate taxes.&quot;   From a fairness standpoint, taxing services makes sense,many contend. &quot;There's no reason why buying a color TV shouldbe taxed and having that color TV repaired should not besubject to a sales tax,&quot; argues John Mikesell, professor ofpublic and environmental affairs at Indiana University andco-author of a book titled &quot;Sales Taxation.&quot;   But there are drawbacks. For starters, almost any new taxis politically unpopular, a fact lost on few legislators.Moreover, until service taxes become common in states, thosethat don't have them will have an economic advantage overthose that do.   &quot;You can tax your services, but you make them lesscompetitive,&quot; says James W. Wetzler, commissioner of taxationand finance for New York state. &quot;States like Massachusettsand Connecticut are going to have to fall behind the field incompetitive ability.&quot; Stiff opposition to a broad service taxprompted New York state to back down and instead levy awatered-down tax on only cleaning and security services.   Not all services in states with service taxes risk losingcustomers to out-of-state competitors, of course. Customersaren't likely to cross state lines for an out-of-statetelevision repairman or studio photographer, for example,just to avoid the tax.   And there are ways to try to limit the effect on otherservice providers. Massachusetts, for instance, will impose a&quot;use fee&quot; equal to the service tax on in-state businessesthat employ an out-of-state accounting firm.   No doubt, a tax on services could create a paper quagmire,especially with scores of exemptions tacked onto bills. InMassachusetts, for instance, separate electric meters mayhave to be used to track the energy used by businessesspecifically for manufacturing (which won't be taxed) asopposed to electricity used for lighting and air conditioning(which will be). If collection difficulties permit many toavoid paying the tax, it could be perceived as inequitableand become even more controversial.   The state's Department of Revenue concedes that taxenforcement won't be without snags. &quot;Certainly there're goingto be glitches,&quot; a department spokeswoman says. &quot;Things, atfirst, aren't going to be crystal clear; there's someeducating to be done to clear up confusion.&quot;   The department is underestimating tax revenue fromservices during the first year, partly in anticipation ofcollection difficulties.   As a result, some states are expected to proceedcautiously. This year, Kentucky toyed with the idea of aservice tax but backed off, afraid of possibly blunting statebusiness. California, still locked in a struggle to balanceits fiscal 1990 budget, isn't considering broadening a salestax.   The Massachusetts Legislature modified its tax bill with apastiche of exemptions to overcome some of the objections andwin political support. For example, it exempted servicesprovided by Massachusetts firms to out-of-state clients fromhaving to pay the tax, so that Massachusetts companieswouldn't be at a competitive disadvantage.   To appease small businesses and individual taxpayers, theLegislature decided to waive the tax on professional bills ofless than $20,000. It also exempted advertising costs andmedical services from the tax. And Boston-based FidelityInvestments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, usedits lobbying clout to get mutual funds exempted from the tax.   But the law will tax 594 types of services, including feescharged by lawyers, accountants, architects and engineers, aswell as parachute training for pleasure, yoga instruction,fortune-telling and piped-in music.   Opponents still haven't given up their campaign againstthe new tax. While the state's Supreme Judicial Court gave anadvisory opinion that the tax doesn't violate the state'sconstitution, several businesses and professional groups sayissues addressed in the ruling were narrow. They plan furtherlegal challenges to the tax, raising U.S. constititutionalissues.   &quot;For instance, the opinion doesn't treat the SixthAmendment issue of an individual's constitutional right to(legal) counsel,&quot; says Charles Swartwood, president of theMassachusetts Bar Association, a reference to the effect theservice tax would have on legal fees. In bypassing that issuein the advisory opinion, &quot;the Supreme (Judicial) Court inessence has invited us to come back to court,&quot; he says.   In addition, a Massachusetts citizens group is seeking todismantle the law this November by bringing before voters aninitiative that would in effect rescind the tax package.</TEXT></DOC>
