Mullen, DistilledSpirits and Tobacco Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Room6235, Ariel Rios Federal Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20226; (202) 566-7531.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Tax on Pipe Tobacco</ITAG>The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (``TMRA'' or the ``Act''),(Pub. L. 100-647), was enacted on November 10, 1988. Section 5061 of theAct amended 26 U.S.C. 5701, to impose a tax at the rate of 45 cents perpound (and a proportionate tax at the like rate on all fractional partsof a pound), on all pipe tobacco manufactured in or imported into the UnitedStates. The tax is determined upon pipe tobacco removed from the factoryor from internal revenue bond, or from Customs custody after December 31,1988.Pipe tobacco is defined in the Act to mean ``any tobacco which becauseof its appearance, type, packaging, or labeling, is suitable for use andlikely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco to be smokedin a pipe.'' The term does not include smoking tobacco products, such asroll your own cigarette tobacco, that are not suitable for use or likelyto be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco to be smoked ina pipe. The act also contains a transitional rule which allows those whoon the date of enactment, November 10, 1988, were engaged in the manufactureof pipe tobacco and who made an application for a permit prior to January1, 1989, to continue to engage in such business pending final action onthe application. In addition, by amending the definitions of the terms``Tobacco products'' and ``Manufacturer of tobacco products'' to includepipe tobacco, the Act subjects manufacturers of such products to all thestatutory and regulatory controls set forth in chapter 52 of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986 (IRC). These controls include tax payment, permitqualification, bonding, recordkeeping, and civil and criminal sanctions.This rule contains temporary regulations implementing the provisions ofsection 5061 of the TMRA described above. In addition, this temporary ruleprescribes the packages, marks, labels, and notices for pipe tobacco.Specifically, these regulations require that every package of pipe tobaccoshall, before removal subject to tax, have imprinted thereon or on a labelsecurely affixed to the package the designation ``pipe tobacco,'' as wellas a statement of the pounds and ounces of the product contained in thepackage. As an alternative to the designation ``pipe tobacco,'' the packagemay be designated ``Tax Class L.'' The Bureau believes that allowing theuse of this alternative designation will avoid consumer confusion and facilitatethe relabeling of many tobacco products which are subject to tax but whichare currently labeled as ``smoking tobacco'' rather than ``pipe tobacco.''This document also contains a transitional rule for package markings forpipe tobacco which will allow manufacturers and importers to use up currentstocks of packaging materials before compliance with the new package markingrequirements is mandatory. Packages in use prior to January 1, 1989, maybe used until March 31, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Floor Stocks Tax</ITAG>Section 5061 of the TMRA also imposed a one-time floor stocks tax at therate of 45 cents per pound (and a proportionate tax at the like rate onall fractional parts of a pound) on all pipe tobacco manufactured in orimported into the United States which is removed from a domestic factoryor from customs custody before January 1, 1989, and held for sale on suchdate by any person. The person who held such pipe tobacco for sale wasliable for payment of this tax on February 14, 1989. Rules for the collectionof the pipe tobacco floor stocks tax are set forth in this document.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to an initialand final regulatory analysis (5 U.S.C. 603, 604) are not applicable tothis document, because it is not required to be preceded by a general noticeof proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or any other statute, andbecause the revenue effects of the rulemaking on small businesses flowdirectly from the underlying statute. The temporary regulations containedin this rule are not expected to have any significant secondary or incidentaleffects on a substantial number of small entities. Further, they will notimpose, or otherwise cause, a significant increase in the reporting, recordkeeping,or other compliance burdens on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This rule is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291,46 FR 13193 (1981), because it will not have an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; it will not result in a major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or localgovernment agencies, or geographic regions; and it will not have significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The requirements to collect information imposed by this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under section 3507 of thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35(OMB Control Number 1512-0502). The estimated average burden associatedwith this collection of information is 5 hours and 30 minutes per respondentor recordkeeper, depending on individual circumstances. Comments concerningthis burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should bedirected to the Chief, Information Programs Branch, Room 7011, Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20226, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503,Attention: Desk Officer for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Procedure Act</ITAG>Because this temporary rule merely extends existing procedures concerningtobacco products to the taxation of pipe tobacco, as provided by statute,it is found to be unnecessary and impracticable to issue these regulationswith notice and public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) or subjectto the effective date limitation of 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>27 CFR Part 270Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Claims, Electronicfund transfer, Excise taxes, Labeling, Packaging and containers, Penalties,Reporting requirements, Seizures and forfeitures, Surety bonds, Tobaccoproducts.27 CFR Part 275Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Cigarettepapers and tubes, Claims, Electronic fund transfer, Customs duties andinspection, Excise taxes, Imports, Labeling, Packaging and containers,Penalties, Reporting requirements, Seizures and forfeitures, Surety bonds,Tobacco products, U.S. possessions, Warehouses.27 CFR Part 290Administrative practice and procedure, Aircraft, Authority delegations,Cigarette papers and tubes, Claims, Customs duties and inspection, Excisetaxes, Exports, Foreign trade zones, Labeling, Packaging and containers,Penalties, Surety bonds, Tobacco products, Vessels, Warehouses.27 CFR Part 295Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations, Cigarettepapers and tubes, Excise taxes, Labeling, Packaging and containers, Tobaccoproducts.27 CFR Part 296Authority delegations, Cigarette papers and tubes, Claims, Disaster assistance,Excise taxes, Floor stocks tax, Penalties, Seizures and forfeitures, Suretybonds, Tobacco products.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Issuance</ITAG>Accordingly, title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 270_[AMENDED]</ITAG><T3>Section A</T3>.
