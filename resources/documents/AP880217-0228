A dissenting justice said the court was walking into a legalmorass.   In a narrowly drawn opinion, seven justices agreed that courtscan act on a request that retarded people be sterilized even thougha state law providing for such action was repealed in 1977.   ``We conclude that our district courts possess subject matterjurisdiction over, and accordingly may hear and determine,applications seeking authorization for sterilization of a mentallyincapacitated ward, such as that involved here,'' the high courtsaid in an opinion written by Justice Bruce Snell.   In his dissent, Justice K. David Harris said the court waswandering into a subject ``shot through with searching social andethical questions.''   ``In taking this first wide leap the majority commits itself tothe eventual resolution of a twisted conglomeration of attendantsocial and ethical issues,'' Harris wrote. ``Future litigants,faced with unanswered questions of great social and ethicaldimensions, or with missing ingredients of a vague applicationprocess, will continue to press us for determinations we aresingularly unfit to reach.''   The majority rejected that reasoning.   ``We do not believe our courts lack jurisdiction over a casemerely because the case is important or unavoidably includes aconstitutional dimension,'' the court said. ``As always, we mustremain mindful that a court cannot escape the demands of judging orof making ... difficult appraisals.''   The decision came in a Polk County case involving Jan and TeklaMatejski, who are legal guardians of their 33-year-old mentallyretarded daughter, court records said.   The couple filed an application with a lower court seekingauthorization to have their daughter sterilized, but a lawyerappointed by the court to represent the daughter's interests arguedthat there was no provision in Iowa law for sterilization.   Polk County Judge Glenn E. Pille agreed and dismissed theapplication.   Both sides appealed.   Lawyers for the woman noted that in 1977 the Legislaturerepealed a law providing for sterilization of people ``who arementally ill or retarded, syphilitic, habitual criminals, moraldegenerates, or sexual perverts and who are a menace to society.''   While agreeing that lower courts can decide such requests, thehigh court refused to set guidelines about when it would beappropriate.   ``We are not persuaded that such action is appropriate given theposture of the present case,'' the court said. ``The excursionsuggested by the parties would be in the nature of an advisoryopinion.''   The high court did not indicate why the parents wanted theirdaughter sterilized.   Harris wrote that the court's decision would return to haunt it.   ``At what level of mental retardation can sterilization becompelled?'' Harris asked. ``What board or body, if any, willsuggest statewide standards?   ``The good news is that the majority, in its obvious and wiserecognition of its inability to do so, chooses not to address thesequestions,'' Harris wrote. ``The bad news is that the majorityconsigns them to Iowa's individual trial judges for ad hocdeterminations.   ``Iowa's trial courts must now face these and, undoubtedly, ahost of other public policy decisions.''   The leading U.S. Supreme Court case on the issue was Buck vs.Bell in 1927, in which the court upheld a Virginia law thatprovided for the sterilization of institutionalized retardedpersons. The decision set guidelines including the appointment of aguardian, a hearing and the right of appeal.   More than 7,500 persons were sterilized before Virginiaabandoned the program in 1972, according to state records cited bythe Washington Post in 1980. In 1981, the Virginia Legislatureenacted new guidelines for judges deciding sterilization cases.   In other cases in recent years:   _In 1985, the California Supreme Court struck down a law enactedin 1980 that banned sterilization of retarded persons. Thefollowing year, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judgeauthorized sterilization of a 31-year-old woman who had Down'sSyndrome. The operation was sought by her parents.   _In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court killed a $3 million lawsuitfiled by a woman who had been sterilized at age 14. The woman hadsought damages from the North Carolina Eugenics Board, whichapproved the surgery in 1974 on the grounds that the woman wasmentally retarded.   A federal appeals court in Virginia had ordered a trial of thesuit, but a U.S. District Court jury in New Bern, N.C., a juryrejected her claim.   _In 1981, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that incompetentindividuals could be sterilized only if a court determined that theoperation appeared to be in the best interest of the patient and ifprocedural safeguards had been followed. The ruling came in a caseinvolving a 19-year-old woman wit</TEXT></DOC>
