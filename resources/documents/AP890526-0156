The proposed limitation is one of several options under reviewin an attempt to cope with an unprecedented flow of Soviets, mostof them Jews, being allowed to leave under the glasnost policies ofMikhail Gorbachev.   If implemented, the new policy could be a boon for Israel whichaccepts every Soviet Jew who can get out. In recent years, about 90percent of Soviet Jews have opted to come to the United Statesrather than Israel, said David Harris of the American JewishCommittee.   Israel, facing a slump in Jewish immigration and a surge in thebirthrate among its Arab minority, has been pushing for years toget more Soviet Jews.   The State Department had no immediate comment on the matter,saying only that various options were under review for dealing withthe influx of Soviet emigres.   Jewish groups and the Justice Department estimate that as manyas 75,000 Soviets will be granted exit visas this year, about55,000 of them Jews and the rest Pentecostalists and Armenians.   About 18,000 Soviets have left the Soviet Union so far thisyear, and another 26,000 applicants are waiting to be interviewedat the U.S. Embassy. The vast majority of Soviet emigres areawarded refugee status by the United States, which means their wayhere and resettlement is paid by the government.   Next year the numbers are expected to increase further,presenting the budget-strapped administration with a severe problem.   The Bush administration, which only budgeted for some 22,500Soviet refugees for fiscal 1989, has asked Congress to fund anadditional 22,500 Soviet refugees this fiscal year. The White Househas also asked for an emergency allocation of $100 million to dealwith the influx.   In addition, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has proposedlegislation that would allow 30,000 admissions of Soviets annually,although not as refugees. Other categories of admissions, such asimmigrants, are not eligible for full federal funding.   Under the proposed change, Soviet applicants would no longer beeligible for refugee status unless they have relatives in theUnited States or a close affiliation with the United States througheducation or other ties, said Harris, whose organization lobbiesfor Soviet Jews.   Existing policy allows admission of Soviets as refugees under acategory of ``national interest,'' in other words because U.S.foreign policy interests seek to encourage the Kremlin to allowfreer emigration.   Removing Soviets from that eligibility would bring theirtreatment in line with that of other refugee groups, like Hispanicsand Asians, Harris said.   An attempt to curb the number of Soviet refugees through apolicy directive from former attorney general Edwin Meese lastsummer failed when U.S. lawmakers and Jewish groups protested.   Meese directed that Soviet Jews would no longer be automaticallygranted refugee status on an assumption that they all sufferedreligious persecution, and instead would be dealt with on acase-by-case basis.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service began implementingthe change and as many as 70 percent of refugee applicants wererejected. But as a result of pressure from Congress, refugeeacceptance has gone up to about 80 percent for Soviet Jews, Harrissaid.</TEXT></DOC>
