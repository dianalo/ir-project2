I feel fine, run several miles each week and haven't been sick in months. But the chiropractor who is charging $59 to analyze my blood, sees signs of a sinister problem.    &quot;Yeast city,&quot; she declares, pointing to some fuzzy-looking objects swimming among my red blood cells. Yeast in the blood, she says, may cause such symptoms as persistent fatigue.    I am skeptical. (Indeed, a follow-up test at a prestigious Chicago hospital finds my blood healthy and normal.) Nevertheless, the woman tries hard to sell me a garlic-based remedy that she says isn't easily found elsewhere. What about the garlic supplements sold in health-food stores? She warns against them: &quot;There's a lot of fraud out there,&quot; she says.    Health Concepts and other vendors of health and fitness tests are doing a booming business by providing services as diverse as hair analyses and stress tests. But many of these tests are under growing fire from physicians, regulators and insurers, who claim they are often unnecessary, inaccurate or misleading. Many of the procedures are part of a pitch for pricey nutrition supplements; others are used as marketing tools by health and exercise clubs to attract customers.    Independent testing labs, which include the new vendors of health and fitness tests, now perform about 35% of the health testing in the U.S., regulators say, and are proliferating too fast to be properly inspected. And doctors protest that the physiologists and medical technicians who often administer the tests aren't qualified to evaluate the results. (Health Concepts says the blood test it gave me was legitimate. &quot;Traditional physicians aren't informed,&quot; says the clinic's chiropractor. &quot;Many aren't willing to learn about new methods.&quot;)    Despite physicians' concerns, the health-and-fitness testing business continues to expand. Many people, regulators say, are too naive or too eager to get in shape to complain about questionable tests. &quot;The people who get taken are the same ones eating fiber and reading health magazines,&quot; says Mary Ann Gardineer, laboratory administrator for the New York Department of Health.    For many people, the tests fill a void created by current trends in the health-care industry. Growth in health-maintenance organizations and other cost-cutting efforts often mean today's physicians offer less hand-holding and personal attention than family doctors of the past.    &quot;A lot of people don't feel their doctor spends enough time listening and explaining,&quot; Ms. Gardineer says. That dissatisfaction is breeding a market for practitioners who &quot;seem to do more&quot; than listen impatiently and prescribe aspirin, she says.    Doctors still unanimously recommend some medical tests, of course. Annual breast exams for women, and checks of the blood pressure, rectum and stool are advised for all patients.    Ironically, the last two, which help detect forms of cancer, aren't trendy. And they're among the least-requested exams by participants in the testing boom.    The accuracy of various health and fitness tests and the advice that often accompanies them vary greatly. In 1985, the New York Attorney General's Office obtained a state court order to stop Bio Health Centers from doing mail-order blood tests after it couldn't tell the difference between a sample of cow and human blood. When an investigator sent the cow's blood to the Costa Mesa, Calif., lab for testing, Bio Health responded that the patient was allergic to 22 substances, including cow's milk and cottage cheese. Efforts to locate the company now were unsuccessful.    Other laboratories perform hair analyses, which adherents claim are an effective way to diagnose the body's mineral and vitamin deficiencies. The clinics are operating in several states despite a 1984 Federal Trade Commission opinion that such tests &quot;are grossly inaccurate and therefore worthless to consumers.&quot;    Doctor's Data Laboratories Inc. in Chicago, for instance, offers various mail-order hair analyses for up to $38. A spokeswoman for the lab says the tests can be a valuable measure of fitness, particularly when interpreted by a client's physician. State health officials say they can't prevent the tests unless such labs peddle follow-up nutrition supplements. Doctor's Data doesn't sell such supplements.    A body-fat test is another increasingly popular procedure. Calipers are used to measure the amount of fat on a person's arms or hips. The percentage of fat to total body weight is then determined and compared with certain &quot;ideal&quot; ranges. But the tests have been criticized by patients and insurers, primarily because the results are so dependent on how the measurements are taken; clinicians who use the calipers can come up with very different figures for the same patient.    Thomas Long, a Columbus, Ohio, attorney, says he received such a test last year through the Young Men's Christian Association. A physical therapist used the metal pincers to &quot;grab me in several places,&quot; Mr. Long says. &quot;He told me my body fat was 10%.&quot; But six months later, after an exercise program that included aerobics and basketball, the same test concluded that Mr. Long's fat content had doubled. &quot;That's crazy,&quot; he says.    John Bickley, a vice president of the Columbus YMCA, concedes that in bodyfat testing, &quot;There's always the possibility of error.&quot;    The more exotic the test, the more popular it often is. Some clinics offer galvanometer tests, which supposedly help diagnose illnesses by measuring the skin's resistance to an electric current. Many physicians dismiss the test as quackery. But Fuller Royal, a former Air Force flight surgeon, says his Las Vegas clinic is booked far in advance by patients who want to pay $225 each to be analyzed by his galvanometer. He says the procedure is based on a patient's &quot;electromagnetic energy balance,&quot; and claims that his practice is &quot;the medicine of the future.&quot;    Health clubs are joining the search for customers by offering &quot;stress tests,&quot; a procedure that is becoming as common as aerobics classes. These tests measure the electrical impulses created by heartbeats while the patient runs on a treadmill -- all for a typical cost of $250.    &quot;People want to get up to the same level as their friends on the treadmill. They talk about it the way they used to talk about their golf scores,&quot; says Mickey Gitlitz, co-owner of Multiplex, a suburban-Chicago exercise club and clinic.    Mr. Gitlitz says the tests occasionally discover problems that result in suspended exercise and even surgery. &quot;We refer people with problems to their physicians. This isn't a hospital,&quot; he says.    But some medical experts attack the tests. &quot;It's a hoax to put people without symptoms on a treadmill and hook them up to an electrocardiograph,&quot; says Robert S. Lawrence, a physician and chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a federally appointed group that is studying physical examinations. A simple blood-pressure test, for example, can serve as a measure of stress at a fraction of the cost and time.    Conversely, Dr. Lawrence says, &quot;we frequently have patients in the emergency room showing every heart-attack symptom and saying, 'It can't be. I passed a stress test last month.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
