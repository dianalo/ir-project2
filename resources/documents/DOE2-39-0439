The authors report on two cases in which the presumptivediagnosis, suggested by venous digital subtraction angiography, was thenconfirmed by selective angiography. In both cases an intravascular approachwith detachable balloons and particulate substances was carried out,with good anatomical and functional results. Problems related to diagnosis,pathophysiology of symptoms, indications for treatment and embolizationtechniques are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
