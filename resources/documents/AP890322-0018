ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For $125 a month, jaded Washington news junkiescan get their fix by the pound, mainlining on raw, unadulteratedpress releases delivered fresh daily from the government'smimeograph machines.   ``Find out what you're missing!'' urges a promotional handbillfrom Chittenden Press Service, a father-son enterprise tucked awayin a cubbyhole office on the 12th floor of the National PressBuilding.   The handbill was wrapped around a free, trial sampling of newsreleases gathered from federal agencies and Capitol Hill officesduring a recent one-week period. The bundle, bound in rubber bands,weighed nearly eight pounds.   What's missing, if Chittenden's potential customers relied ontelevision, newspapers or magazines for their news, included:   _A White House announcement of two nominees for the FederalService Impasses Panel.   _Eleven separate releases from Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,announcing minor bills she had introduced, ranging from overtime payfor FBI agents to a new federal department of the arts andhumanities.   _A notice of a decision by the U.S. International TradeCommission ``not to review an initial determination terminatinginvestigation ... in the matter of certain venetian blindscomponents.''   _An Energy Department report that ``the nation's domestic uraniummining and milling industry was not viable in calendar year 1987.''   _Lengthy statistical tables from the Federal Reserve, theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Federal CommunicationsCommission, and a Commerce Department report on ``composite indexesof leading, coincident and lagging indicators'' for November 1988.   _A seven-page report by the Bureau of Mines on domestic nickelconsumption last August and a 16-page report on cement shipments inOctober.   _A news release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with aheadline quoting its chairman as saying ``no news is good news.''   One reader's yawner might be another's hot news, and staying ontop of the Washington chase has kept three generations ofChittendens in business since 1945.   ``This town runs on paper,'' said Dave Chittenden, 30. ``We'reswimming in it.''   Dave and his father, Bob Chittenden, estimate they pick up about100 pounds of ``handouts,'' as reporters call them, from variousfederal agencies and congressional offices every weekday.   They deliver them almost immediately to about 250 subscribersaround Washington, including news organizations, corporate offices,law firms, lobbyists and public relations firms for a monthly $125fee.   In addition, they will distribute a client's own handouts to 450media outlets on the same day for a flat $55. These clients rangefrom the Teamsters union to the National Wildlife Federation.   Bob Chittenden, a short, wiry man of 67 who inherited thebusiness from his father, LeRoy, appears at the Pentagon at 6:15a.m. every day to pick up the first batch of news releases.   He begins deliveries when Dave reports to work about 8 a.m. Withthe help of three contract couriers, they manage to finish theirpickups and deliveries by midafternoon, dropping the last bundles ofhandouts on subscribers' desks on their way home.   Both have worried about the threat to their livelihood fromfacsimile machines and computer mail, but so far the demand forpaper in this town has not diminished.   ``I've spent a lot of sleepless nights worrying about thecomputer revolution,'' Dave said. ``People were saying computerswould make paper obsolete by the 1980s, but it hasn't happened and Idon't think it's going to.''   Said his father: ``Everybody in Washington wants to know what thegovernment and Congress are doing. When the government works, wework.''</TEXT></DOC>
