The absence of influential oil ministers made it unlikely, inthe view of experts, that significant action could be taken to dealwith the current imbalance between oil prices and production.   In addition to debating price and production, the conferencewill consider some 50 papers on a variety of energy-relatedsubjects.   Sources said emphasis will be given to the petrochemicalindustry. One paper to be discussed makes the point that Arabcountries produce 22.1 percent of the world's oil but less than 3percent of the world's petrochemicals.   Another paper prepared by the Organization of Arab PetroleumExporting Countries estimated that the Arab world has 57.3 percentof the world's proven oil reserves and 17.2 percent of the world'sproven gas reserves with major potential for increasing reserves ofboth fuels with new technology.   Issam Abdul-Rahim Al-Chalabi of Iraq, and his Saudi counterpart,Hisham Nazer, were the only oil ministers from major Araboil-exporting countries present among 550 delegates to the four-dayconference.   Though oil ministers of major Arab oil-producers gave personalor professional reasons for their absences, sources suggested therecent missile attacks by Iran and Iraq on each others' capitalsmay have contributed to ministerial cancellations.   Seven Arab nations are among 13 members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries. Ten Arab nations belong to theOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting States, a sponsor of theconference along with the 22-member Arab League.   Among OPEC or OAPEC oil ministers missing were from Kuwait,Libya, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria and Egypt.   A paper before the conference notes that Arab oil income fromoil was $178 billion in 1981 and $52 in 1986.   The oil cartel is currently facing deteriorating oil prices asproduction exceeds demand.   OPEC has been trying to prop up its official price of $18 perbarrel. But member nations have been forced to give discounts tomatch market prices several dollars lower.   The OPEC ministers are divided on whether to lower productionquotas in order to defend the official price or to lower the priceto defend their share of the market against non-OPEC producers.</TEXT></DOC>
