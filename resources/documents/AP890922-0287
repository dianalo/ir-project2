Even before the start of discussions scheduled for late Saturday,some ministers arriving in Geneva expressed concern over what theyconsider to be weak crude prices. Eight ministers comprising theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price monitoring andlong-term strategy committee are scheduled to meet.   An increase in OPEC production, which some believe the ministersmight authorize, would likely cause prices to slip, analysts say.   ``There's no need to raise the ceiling as long as the priceobjective is not met,'' said Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena.   But Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil chief, said, ``Iwould like to see a reasonable increase in the ceiling.'' He didn'tspecify a level.   However, observers as well as some OPEC ministers have said theydon't expect a resolution to the volatile issue of permanent quotasat this latest meeting. Instead, it appeared the quota issue wouldbe bumped to November, when the full cartel is to meet in Vienna.   ``We can always discuss it, but there will not be a decision inthis area,'' said Boussena.   The 13-nation cartel is pumping about 22 million barrels a day,according to various estimates, well over the output cap of 19.5million barrels set by OPEC for the last six months of the year.   The ministers agreed in June to meet this month to decide whetherto lift the ceiling 500,000 barrels a day to 20 million barrels, orperhaps more.   Although world oil prices are weaker than they were last springand remain below the catel's benchmark of $18 a barrel, strongdemand has kept them surprisingly firm despite OPEC's excessproduction.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto has estimated that demand for thecartel's oil might be around 22 million barrels a day in theOctober-December quarter.   A basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC averaged $17.04 abarrel last week. It had topped the $18-mark last spring.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of American oil, hasbeen trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 a 42-gallon barrel.   Chalabi, arriving in mid-afternoon from an energy conference inMontreal, told reporters that the OPEC ministers would reviewconditions in the constantly changing oil market.   He said some countries were opposed to an output increase because``they want to defend the price.'' Others, he said, think ``supplyand demand warrant a much higher ceiling.''   Boussena said there was a ``link'' between the cartel'sproduction level and its price, and he noted that prices had notreached OPEC's benchmark in the last three months.   Ecuador's Diego Tamariz also seemed worried about prices.   ``We still have to obtain the goal of $18,'' he said, adding that``we should work on it.''   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at the investment firm of Barclays deZoete Wedd in London, said prices would likely fall 50 cents or adollar a barrel if the cartel were to lift the supply cap withoutcurtailing members' cheating.   An increase of 500,000 barrels a day, he said, would probablykick up total output to about 22.5 million barrels.   The ministers were also expected to begin tackling the toughissue of how to meet some members' demands for a higher share of theproduction pie. Each country is given a quota, or a daily productionlevel.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have in recent months ignoredtheir quotas and pumped as much as double their shares' of about amillion barrels each, analysts' estimate.   Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, said his promise atthe June meeting to hold the line on production was conditional.   ``If everybody sticks to the quota, fine. If anybody breaks it,the others have the same right,'' he told reporters outside theluxury hotel where the ministers' will hold their discussions.   The talks will technically be held by a monitoring panel ofministers from Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria,Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The others - Gabon, Ecuador, Libya,Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - were also invited to attend.   Saudia Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, was reportedrecovering from surgery in the United States and was not attending.</TEXT></DOC>
