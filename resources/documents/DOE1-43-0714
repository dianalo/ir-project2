It depends on measuring the induced changes in thediameter of certain polymer fibers, namely, nylon 6, polyester and dralon.The diameter measurements are carried out by studying the diffractionpatterns of the fibers using a He-Ne laser beam before and after irradiationwith different fluences of fission neutrons in the range 10/sup 5/ -10/sup 10/n cm/sup -2/. The changes in diameter were observed on photographstaken with the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showedthat, for all samples, the diameters were increased by radiation. However,dralon fibers proved to be most sensitive to neutrons. Moreover, SEMstudies confirmed the observed dilation of the fibers.</TEXT></DOC>
