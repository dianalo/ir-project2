Henley, an engineering and financial services concern, previously had indicated it might spin off part of the businesses making up the new unit, certain chemical and manufacturing operations. The company said it would retain the remaining majority interest in the new Henley Manufacturing Corp. unit.    The move is part of a corporate strategy to distribute shares of minority interest to holders and, in one previous case, to the public.    Based on the new company's book value of $366.2 million, a spokesman said, the stock dividend to Henley Group's current holders could be valued at about $1.60 a share.    The new unit is made up of the former General Chemical Corp. unit of Henley as well as manufacturing operations that include Prestolite Wire Corp. and Toledo Stamping andamp; Manufacturing Corp.    Henley Group had $3.17 billion in revenue for all of 1986.    For the first half of 1987, earnings for the operations being combined in Henley Manufacturing rose to $11.2 million from the year-earlier period's $1.1 million. Revenue fell to $306 million from $335.2 million, Henley Group said.    In all of 1986, the Henley Manufacturing operations had a loss of $35.1 million on revenue of $656.4 million. The spokesman said, however, that the loss included restructuring charges.    Henley Manufacturing's assets on June 30 were $634.3 million, he added.    The spin-off, expected to take place in the fourth quarter, would be the second such stock dividend to Henley holders in a year. In April, Henley issued holders shares constituting a 20% equity in its Fisher Scientific Corp. unit. Henley also recently sold a 19.5% stake in its Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Henley Group shares rose 37.5 cents to $29.625. </TEXT></DOC>
