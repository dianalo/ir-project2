While Iran announced last week that it would accept a U.N.Security Council cease-fire resolution, Iraqis say they hope toforge a lasting peace with their longstanding rival to the east.   A cease-fire alone might pave the way for further talks, Iraqisand diplomats say, but it would not solve major and often enduringdisputes between the two sides.   These include Iran's support of Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq,Iraq's backing of Iranian rebels along the border, a disputed stripof land, and arguments over borders and navigation in the ShattAl-Arab, Iraq's main outlet to the sea, that date back centuries.   ``For the international community, the important thing is tocease hostilities,'' a Western diplomat said. ``For this country,the important thing is to find peace. These are two completelydifferent aspects.''   He said it could take ``months if not years'' to achieve a finalpeace settlement.   ``We don't want a situation where we get into a worse war in acouple of years,'' a senior Iraqi official told reporters over theweekend.   The Iraqi official, who also demanded anonymity, indicated hiscountry would not rush into any settlement. ``We have lived with it(war) for eight years. If it takes eight more weeks, no problem,''he said.   He said the need for serious peace talks was behind Iraq'sinsistence on direct talks with Iran. Iran has balked at theproposal.   On the heels of Iran's cease-fire decision, Iraq launchedsizeable offensives that it said drove the last remaining Iranianforces from its territory. It pushed several miles into Iran.   Iraq announced that more than 8,500 Iranians were taken captive.   A military communique, which Iraq said was drafted by PresidentSaddam Hussein, said the attacks were aimed at paving the way forpeace by reclaiming all Iraqi territory and taking captives,apparently to even the numbers that will have to be exchanged afterthe war.   Communiques also said the attacks were aimed at smashing Iran'salready reeling war machine. Despite Iranian claims the Iraqiinvasion reached nearly 40 miles inside Iran, the Iraqi troopsappeared to have withdrawn to their own borders within hours aftertheir forays into Iranian territory.   After the war, a rebuilt Iran will pose a continuing challengeto Iraq, which has a third of its neighbor's population.   The two countries clashed diplomatically and militarily duringthe rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, which preceded Iran'sIslamic revolution.   Under a 1975 pact, Iran agreed to stop financing Kurdish rebelswho posed a serious problem for the Iraqi government and toguarantee free navigation along the Shatt Al-Arab, which leads toIraq's main port of Basra.   Iraq's September 1980 invasion of Iran followed Iranian shellingof Iraqi towns and a declaration to close the Shatt.   Iraq renounced the 1975 agreement, claiming Iran already haddone so, but Iraqi officials continue to refer to the pact as abasis for their claims to a strip along the central border.   The Iraqi official said Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's acceptanceof a cease-fire has destroyed Iran's dream of spreading its versionof Islam throughout the region. ``This is a watershed between twoeras,'' he said.   It means Iran has ``accepted the notion of coexisting with asecular regime'' and accepted political boundaries, he said.   ``By accepting that in a legal and political sense, it will bethe end of a model,'' he said, referring to Iran's hopes ofexporting its revolution.</TEXT></DOC>
