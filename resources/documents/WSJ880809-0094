Since June 1986, when the Supreme Court put the onus on management to prevent harassment on the job, many firms have added or beefed up programs. Carolina Power had no specific policy in 1986; now harassment is one of 14 topics given equal time at orientation. Excelan Inc. publishes articles in its employee newspaper illustrating how problems can arise.    But Polaroid shrinks to 2 1/2 hours from a half-day the time spent on the topic in training sessions. The emphasis is no longer needed, says a Polaroid officer, because &quot;the court decision made managers aware of the seriousness of the issue.&quot; Some smaller firms are less formal. Carriage Industries says it has counted on an &quot;open-door&quot; policy to air problems. But since the Calhoun, Ga., company has grown to 600 employees from 95 in eight years, it mulls adding the issue to a personnel handbook.    Raytheon says employees more readily come forward with problems, but the trend began before the court acted.    COMPANY STOCK gets more popular as a reward for outside directors.    Of 100 top industrial firms, 26 gave outside directors shares this year, up from four in 1984, says a study by consultants TPFandamp;C. Firms want to show that directors, like management, have a &quot;commitment&quot; to shareholders, says TPFandamp;C vice president Gordon Wolf. He notes stock has some tax advantages over other forms of compensation.    But he warns that companies should ask &quot;how much stock is too much?&quot; A director holding a large block may become more interested in short-term results than long-term corporate health. That director may also be more &quot;tempted to vote his pocketbook&quot; in a takeover fight, says Mr. Wolf.    UNPOPULAR ASSIGNMENTS complicate the nursing shortage.    Nurses at St. Christopher's in Philadelphia don't want the extra stress of critical-care units; at Howard University Hospital in Washington, general wards are deemed not &quot;glamorous&quot; enough, says the nursing director. Some hospitals change nurses' tasks. At Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, N.J., &quot;monitor techs&quot; and &quot;nursing techs&quot; relieve RNs. At Cooper Hospital in Camden, N.J., clerks take over mundane tasks.    Most hospitals improve benefits and salaries. New Britain General in Connecticut offers care for nurses' children as young as six weeks, and pays nurses working two 12-hour weekend shifts for a 40-hour week. Salaries have jumped 25% in one year; a senior RN on night duty can earn $46,000. Cottage Hospital in Grosse Pointe, Mich., gives new hires sign-on bonuses.    But there are other concerns: at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital, nurses elected to &quot;unit committees&quot; work for more power in decision-making.    A DRESSING-DOWN in public is the worst breach of business etiquette, said 45% of top executives at 100 large companies in a survey by Robert Half International. An additional 28% said &quot;not giving others an opportunity to express themselves&quot; is the worst offense. And 6% were rankled most by people who are late for appointments.    A CRASH COURSE teaches union officials, social workers and activists about the economy: how to view it from a &quot;radical&quot; perspective, but negotiate ably with the establishment. At the Center for Popular Economics in Amherst, Mass., they study business cycles and the trade deficit, and debate &quot;what is the economy?&quot; and &quot;where does wealth come from?&quot;    EXCEPT ON WALL STREET, demand for top executives is expected to remain robust, says search firm Thorndike Deland. Senior level searches are up 40%, says Goodrich andamp; Sherwood, partly because of cuts in middle management. Companies &quot;decide to do away with three or four B players and bring in one A player.&quot;    IT'S TOO RISKY, says the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, to let people using insulin be licensed as truck drivers. The group urges the Federal Highway Administration to reject a petition for waivers from the American Diabetes Association.    HOTELS ESCHEW better benefit packages, despite turnover.    Sixty percent of hotel operators say employee turnover is a top problem, but according to a study by Laventhol andamp; Horwath, an industry &quot;tradition&quot; of &quot;relatively skimpy&quot; compensation packages hurts efforts to get and keep executives. Only 45% of hotel companies surveyed offer on-site managers performance-based incentives such as stock options and bonuses, vs. 92% of companies in industry generally.    Only about 30% offer fully paid major medical coverage, health and accident insurance or medical/surgical insurance. These &quot;are a minimum for any employer that needs a competent, career-oriented staff,&quot; says Laventhol partner Ed Crego.    The survey showed more than 40% of firms worried most about work-force motivation or individual productivity.    THE CHECKOFF: The Service Employees' Justice for Janitors group protests at the World Bank, arguing that despite the Bank's &quot;mission to eliminate poverty abroad,&quot; it allows &quot;the impoverishment of janitors&quot; who clean Bank buildings. . . . The Labor Department lauds Prince George's County, Md., schools for developing &quot;student warranties&quot; guaranteeing employers that graduates have certain skills. . . . The American Federation of Teachers says that, after inflation, the average teacher now makes just $500 more than in 1972. </TEXT></DOC>
