The coroner had not yet identified the couple and the child, butneighbors said the girl was Judith Barsi, 11, who starred in thethird sequel to the series about a man-eating shark.   Miss Barsi also appeared in the partly fact-based televisionmovie ``Fatal Vision,'' playing a daughter of Dr. JeffreyMacDonald, who was convicted of killing his pregnant wife and bothhis daughters at Fort Bragg, N.C., in 1970.   Miss Barsi's father apparently shot the girl and the mother intheir heads, set the inside of the house on fire, then turned thegun on himself, police said. The fire caused extensive damage tothe interior of the home.   A researcher at Universal Studios confirmed Miss Barsi starredin ``Jaws IV: The Revenge'' as a character called ``Thea.'' Shealso performed in several commercials and had appeared in thetelevision show ``Growing Pains,'' neighbors said.   ``She was adorable ... quite precocious, blonde and blue-eyed,''said former neighbor Adrienne Conway. She said the mother andfather had been having marital problems.   Neighbors said they heard an explosion at 8:30 a.m., then sawflames shooting out of a front window of the tan, single-storyhouse on a quiet street. One neighbor tried to douse the flameswith water from a garden hose until firefighters arrived.   Officers at the scene said the father, identified by neighborsas Joe Barsi, apparently doused the interior of the couple's homewith gasoline and set it ablaze before shooting himself in the head.   The mother, Maria Barsi, estimated to be about 40, was found inthe hallway and the body of Miss Barsi in a bedroom, officialssaid. Both had been burned, said Fire Battalion Chief Jack Monroe.   Los Angeles Police Lt. Warren Knowles said the man was foundstill holding the gun.   Neighbors said the girl had an extremely protective father.   ``The child was not allowed to go anywhere, very few placesalone,'' said neighbor Linda Williams. ``Even when she came to ourhome, it always had to be OK'd by Dad before she came up the streetbecause apparently he was afraid she would run away.''</TEXT></DOC>
