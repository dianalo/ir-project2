Essentially, top monetary policy makers in Tokyo want thefinancial markets to believe that the Bank of Japan is readyto raise interest rates further to fend off inflation inJapan before this becomes a problem.</LP><TEXT>   Until last week, the financial markets had considered thecentral bank's tough stance mere posturing, the necessarybluster of a good watchdog. But as interest rates in Tokyo'scredit markets began creeping higher, stock and bond marketsin Japan and elsewhere started to panic. Then the Bank ofJapan retreated, explaining that it isn't tightening credit,rather just holding firm.   &quot;They really backed off,&quot; Patricia Kurayama, J.P. MorganTrust Bank Ltd.'s chief economist in Japan, said. &quot;They'retrying to compensate for the fright they gave people.&quot;   The fright was real enough. Since Friday, the Nikkeiaverage of 225 stocks has lost 1,353.16 points, or 4.1%, itssteepest drop since it came out of a three-monthlong nosedive in early April. On Tuesday, the index closed at31702.46, off 192.33 points from Monday.   Japanese bond yields are hovering at their highest levelsin more than six years. The No. 119 10-year government bondrose 0.12 to 85.83, to yield 7.445%, its first gain in sixtrading sessions. (This yield is eqivalent to a 6.95%semiannual compounded yield to maturity.)   &quot;Interest rates are almost the entire picture&quot; in themarkets, Christopher Taylor, head of sales at BaringSecurities (Japan) Ltd., a British brokerage house, said.&quot;There's a lot of confusion in the market,&quot; Russell Jones, ananalyst at UBS Philips andamp; Drew Securities Ltd., said.   The jitters aren't confined to Tokyo. The steep drop instocks and related futures in the U.S. on Monday was ascribedat least in part to worries that Japan might raise interestrates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 56.44 pointsto 2904.70 Monday, and at one point was off 105 points.   Many analysts fear that an increase in the Bank of Japanofficial discount rate, the amount it charges on loans tofinancial institutions, could trigger an international roundof credit tightening -- a cycle Japanese officialsdesperately want to avoid.   Yet this could be the embarrassing outcome of a formalincrease in Japanese rates just now. In the U.S., the FederalReserve has been allowing interest rates to slide slightly inrecent weeks, and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted atfurther easing. But if Japan raises its rates, economistssaid, the difference between U.S. and Japanese rates, afteradjustment for inflation, might widen sufficiently todiscourage big Japanese investors from buying U.S. Treasurybonds.   After deducting the effects of inflation, Japanesegovernment bonds already yield about 0.3 to 0.4 of apercentage point more than comparable long-term U.S. Treasurybonds. &quot;It's obvious,&quot; a bond-market analyst in Japan said.&quot;You can make more on a Japanese bond and not take aforeign-exchange risk.&quot;   With the U.S. Treasury planning a $31.5 billion bond salein the second week of August, an increase in Japanese ratesnow could be especially damaging. To entice Japaneseinvestors, analysts said, U.S. rates would have to rise.   In large measure, the financial markets' case of nervescan be ascribed to traumatic memories of the last formalcredit tightening by the Bank of Japan. The Tokyo stockmarket had managed to ignore three increases that broughtJapan's discount rate from its historic low of 2.5% in May to4.25% at the end of last year, when the Nikkei average of 225major stocks stood at a record high of 38915.87.   But the Japanese stock market started coming unglued earlythis year. By the time the Bank of Japan boosted the discountrate a fourth time, to 5.25%, on March 20, the stock marketwas plunging. Before it stabilized, the Nikkei index plungedmore than 27% from its peak. Memories of the stock marketturmoil are still fresh, analysts said.   &quot;One of the things that has stayed the Bank of Japan'shand recently is the Japanese stock market,&quot; Aaron M. Cohen,senior financial economist at Daiwa Securities Co., said.&quot;The stock market's weakness is the one big deterrent toraising official rates.&quot;   Economists and central-bank watchers are divided on thequestion of whether the Bank of Japan really needs -- orintends -- to raise rates. The Japanese economy grew at arapid 10.4% annualized rate in the first quarter and isn'tslowing down noticeably. The Bank of Japan on Friday said thesecond quarter was unexpectedly strong, too. But inflationhas been tame; June's wholesale prices increased only 0.9%from a year earlier.   Still, Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at SalomonBrothers Inc.'s Tokyo office, believes the Japanese centralbank already has painted itself into a corner by allowingmoney market rates to reach such high levels. Some rates, henoted, are certain to rise; Japan's long-term credit banksare negotiating to raise their prime lending rate this week,with most market participants expecting an increase of 0.3percentage point. This would mean Japanese companies wouldpay a minimum of 7.9% on long-term loans, the same as theypaid in May.   With other interest rates rising, the Bank of Japan has&quot;very little choice now&quot; but to raise rates, &quot;because theeconomy is not slowing down,&quot; Mr. Feldman said. &quot;It's just amatter of timing.&quot; He speculated that the central bank mightwait until after the U.S. government's August bond sale -- oreven until after German monetary authorities succumb to thefinancial pressures of reunification and raise their officialinterest rates.   Nobuyuki Ueda, senior economist at Long-Term Bank of JapanLtd., agrees that because of the feverish first-quartergrowth rate, an increase in Japanese interest rates withinthe next four or five months is inevitable. &quot;I don't thinkthe timing is important, but the future trend of interestrates is definitely up,&quot; he said.   But other analysts said it isn't clear that the Bank ofJapan will raise rates. The central bank openly sought toplay down its own credit-tightening moves in the marketsFriday and early this week, with its governor, Yasushi Mieno,even stating publicly that the moves were misread by themarket.   And at a meeting last week of the central bank's branchmanagers, only a handful of the regional chiefs favoredanother discount-rate increase. The consensus, according toparticipants, was that the central bank should wait longerbefore judging the effects of the last discount-rate increaseand the ensuing increases in market rates.   For Japanese policy makers, these are delicate times.Officials would like to avoid an interest-rate increase thatcould choke off the nation's 44-month-long economic boom.   Yet partly as a result of the central bank's decision inFebruary 1987 to reduce its discount rate to 2.5%, stock andland prices in Japan soared. The vast sums generated by thisso-called asset inflation continue to slosh around Japan --and are the chief target of the current efforts by the Bankof Japan to crimp spending.   In addition, the Japanese government is looking ahead at adecade of relatively generous fiscal policy. As part of amajor economic agreement reached last month with Washington,the Japanese government has agreed to pump 430 trillion yen($2.902 trillion) into public works projects over the nextdecade. The aim is to reduce the Japanese public's savings.The effect, though, will be to pour fresh money into theeconomy, at a time when the central bank is trying to curbspending.</TEXT></DOC>
