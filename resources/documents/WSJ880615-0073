Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR STK CMD </IN><G> CNG EXE FED SEC CFT </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the White House working group of financial regulators said technological and other changes in the markets make it necessary to consider modifying the New York Stock Exchange's specialist system.    Testifying before the House Agriculture Committee, Treasury Undersecretary George Gould argued that there is an inherent contradiction between the specialist's obligation to slow price movements by making an orderly market in a stock and the notion of efficient markets in which prices respond rapidly to new information. The Big Board's specialists, or market makers, have exclusive franchises in an assigned stock and are obliged to maintain an orderly market in it.    &quot;I think the exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the working group, et cetera, should take some time to consider whether a modification of that role, whether a modification of the procedures of the stock exchange, are in effect dictated by rapid dissemination of information and by the institutionalization of capital,&quot; Mr. Gould said.    The specialist system has been attacked frequently since the October market crash, especially by the Chicago-based futures markets. But Mr. Gould's comments represent the first time that the working group has said structural changes might be needed in the markets.    In other testimony, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that proposals to discourage pension funds and other institutional investors from using the stock futures market would, if enacted, drive futures trading overseas. As with Mr. Gould's remarks, this isn't a new argument, but it is likely to carry more weight now that it has Mr. Greenspan's apparent endorsement.    The Fed chief, a member of the working group, also emphasized his view that there is no &quot;solution&quot; to the central problem of the October stock market crash. &quot;There are a number of things that can be done legislatively which will improve the markets,&quot; he said, &quot;but none of them would have changed what happened back on Oct. 19, and none of them would prevent similar events from occurring in the future if the fundamentals of the economy and the financial system produce major disruptions.&quot;    The bulk of the hearing, however, was devoted to criticism of the SEC and its chairman, David Ruder, for seeking to take authority over stock-related futures trading away from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which the Agriculture Committee oversees.    In a series of exchanges marked by a shortage of Capitol Hill's usual civility, Agriculture panel members told Mr. Ruder the SEC should improve its own performance before asking Congress to widen its jurisdiction.    &quot;Since the SEC has some well-established problems in regulating its own house, why in the world should we expand your authority?&quot; asked Rep. David Nagle (D., Iowa).    Similarly, Rep. Glenn English (D., Okla.), noting the heavy volume of investor complaints about the performance of the options markets -- which are regulated by the SEC -- during the market crash, said, &quot;Maybe you ought to take a look at your own shop.&quot;    Mr. Ruder, another member of the working group, vigorously rejected such suggestions and occasionally appeared on the verge of losing his temper. After a prolonged discussion with Rep. English about whether the SEC conveyed misinformation last Oct. 20 when it told futures exchanges that the New York Stock Exchange was about to close, Mr. Ruder said: &quot;I'm not going to argue with you anymore. You're just not listening to me.&quot;    In less contentious testimony, Mr. Ruder said small investors are staying away from the market not only because of natural post-crash apprehension but also because of &quot;concern about excess volatility.&quot;    Expressing a concern of his own, Mr. Ruder said some institutional investors may have failed to learn from the crash that they can't get out of the market as quickly as they think they can.    &quot;Even in the absence of portfolio insurance,&quot; he said, &quot;I personally have some fear that there are still large traders in the market who may believe on a particular day it may be in their own economic selfinterest to try to sell more quickly than other large portfolio holders.&quot;    But, as in their previous appearances before congressional panels, other members of the working group indicated they don't think regulators should attempt to influence the behavior of institutional investors. &quot;Other than doubtful Draconian measures . . . there is little that new regulation can or should do about institutionalization of stock ownership and the changes in (money) management techniques it has engendered,&quot; Mr. Gould said.    The SEC chairman was similarly isolated on the question of whether boosting stock futures margins could drive futures trading overseas. He said he is concerned about the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. markets but said the prospect of futures trading in U.S. stocks moving offshore is &quot;quite hypothetical&quot; because no such market currently exists.    CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, the fourth member of the working group, emphatically disagreed, saying such trading could start up quickly.    Mr. Gould's comments on the specialist system didn't attract much interest from the committee, which generally seemed interested in using the subject as a way of attacking the SEC.    If it is good for markets to respond quickly to new information, the Treasury undersecretary said, &quot;then the specialist doesn't have anywhere near the purpose he has had in the past of trying to conduct an orderly market.&quot;    Richard Grasso, president of the New York Stock Exchange, seemed surprised by the comments of Mr. Gould, who recently addressed the exchange's board. &quot;We have historically felt, and today feel, that the affirmative obligation we place on the specialist to conduct a fair and orderly market serves investors, both institutional and individual, very well,&quot; he said. &quot;To suggest that we should re-examine whether that should be there isn't a direction we had contemplated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
