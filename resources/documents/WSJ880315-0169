At the start of the month, the four European ministers responsible for the aircraft consortium gave a &quot;mandate&quot; to Jean Pierson, Airbus's president, to enter serious collaboration talks with McDonnell Douglas Corp. of the U.S. They asked for a detailed plan by early May, and said Airbus should negotiate &quot;in a real spirit of reaching an agreement.&quot;    The stated aim is for Airbus and McDonnell Douglas to collaborate on one or more new airplanes that don't compete with either company's existing ones. This would spread risks, reduce financing needs on both sides and give giant Boeing Co. a run for its money.    Airbus and McDonnell Douglas have had cooperation talks on and off for five years. But while there isn't any way of knowing whether this round will be successful, it appears the Europeans have new reasons for pushing collaboration.    The four consortium paymasters -- France, West Germany, Britain and Spain -- want to bring Airbus costs under control. Collaboration with a foreign competitor is one possibility; more-stringent financial controls are another.    Just how far Airbus wants to take collaboration talks remains unclear. The U.S. for 2 1/2 years has been calling for an end to Airbus government subsidies and is threatening a trade war over the issue. There is suspicion in U.S. industry and government that the latest effort is a political exercise to cool American complaints about subsidies and avert a trade war. &quot;The day that trade pressures evaporate, {Airbus's} interest in McDonnell Douglas cooperation is over,&quot; says one U.S. aerospace executive.    But the Europeans claim otherwise. &quot;Everyone thinks we are {pushing collaboration} for cosmetic considerations,&quot; says a French government official involved with Airbus. &quot;Absolutely not. We do it because it makes sense industrially.&quot;    In addition, Airbus now claims that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have received more than $23 billion from the U.S. government in the past 10 years. The U.S. companies deny that.    A link with McDonnell Douglas could defuse trade tensions between the U.S. and the European Community over Airbus subsidies and selling prices; that alone could be an important political gain. The two sides are to meet Friday in Konstanz, West Germany, for a supposed milestone meeting in the long-simmering dispute.    Active talks between Airbus and one of its chief trade antagonists, McDonnell Douglas, certainly would erode U.S. arguments. Indeed, optimistic European press reports about prospects for cooperation caught U.S. trade negotiators off balance, American observers say.    They also caused Jim Worsham, president of McDonnell Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, to deflate expectations. Mr. Worsham, who has been through this before, calls the talks preliminary, and emphasizes that any agreement is far off.    Politics aside, it isn't any secret that the European states are tired of carrying Airbus -- in ways that weren't true in early Airbus years. British Aerospace PLC received only #450 million ($831.7 million), #300 million less than requested, from the United Kingdom for work on the new A-330 and A-340 program, while Aerospatiale, the French partner, came away with only 60% of the state aid it wanted. Bonn has spent two years seeking a private company to invest in Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., whose Airbus activities are deeply in the red.    Airbus's target date for profitability, the mid-1990s, keeps slipping. U.S. competitors say profitability won't occur until the next century -- if at all. The weak dollar exacerbates the problem. With revenues in dollars and 75% of costs in European currencies, Airbus's operating loss is widening.    Until recently, Airbus had little incentive to cut costs. The consortium had strong political support and was designed to give Europe high-technology jobs and products, plus prestige. So government treasuries were generous. But today, having reached a world market share of near 30%, Mr. Pierson, the Airbus president, is being told to do things differently and talks of cutting costs by one-third.    Another sign of restraint occurred in January, when the intergovernmental committee that supervises the consortium appointed an independent panel to study Airbus and recommend operating changes. Airbus calls this unprecedented appointment &quot;normal&quot; and overdue. The company hasn't changed its organization much in 18 years, a spokesman says, but has grown from one aircraft model to five, from a tiny staff to 1,250 and from one customer to 71, with some 400 planes in service.    Cooperation is one obvious way to contain cost growth. But there has been little interest. Indeed, Airbus suspected that prior U.S. overtures were designed to stall its projects rather than start new, joint ones. Pride is also a factor. Mr. Pierson, says a U.S. competitor, &quot;is tough, capable and very successful. Left to his own devices, he wouldn't cooperate with anyone.&quot;    This is understandable, the French government official says. Mr. Pierson's &quot;first job is to sell planes and fight against his competitors, like McDonnell Douglas,&quot; the official says. </TEXT></DOC>
