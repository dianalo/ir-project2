In the case of offshore structures, realisticsimulation of the service environment in the laboratory tests is essentialand quantitative behaviour modelling for predictive purposes is desirable.This chapter outlines a quantitative model of corrosion-fatigue crackgrowth which has been successfully used to predict behaviour in benignaqueous environments. Recent data obtained in environments containingH/sub 2/S shows growth-rate enhancements which are beyond the limitationsof the model in some cases. More sophisticated mechanistic modellingof crack-tip microprocesses involving hydrogen and testing in even morerealistic simulation of environments, such as seawater containing microbiologicallygenerated H/sub 2/S, are needed to redefine the upper limit of corrosion-fatiguecrack growth rates.</TEXT></DOC>
