No one would enter the 2,000-foot tunnel until levels of methane,a gas formed when organic materials decompose, had dissipated, saidPat Freeman, safety director for the S.A. Healy Co.   ``We want it completely purged,'' he said. ``We still don't knowwhat kind of reading you're going to get way up in the head.''   Investigators from the Milwaukee County District Attorney'soffice and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administrationvideotaped the site of Thursday's blast but did not enter the tunnel.   Healy Co. is looking for a contractor to drill a hole at the headof the tunnel, which would allow the methane to escape and couldspeed up the process, Freeman said.   ``The investigators from the DA's office do want to get down assoon as we can get in,'' he said. Methane levels should be lowenough next week to allow investigators to enter the tunnel, Freemansaid.   Phillip Van Kuiken, OSHA safety supervisor, declined to discussthe investigation, as did Richard Heath, who was representing thedistrict attorney's office at the scene. Officials are unsure whatcaused the blast.   The explosion ripped through the tunnel at about 9 a.m. as thethree workers carried monitoring equipment to check high levels ofmethane that forced workers to evacute.   Rescue workers, who had to clear explosive fumes and removetwisted wreckage while contending with poor lighting and knee-deepmud, took eight hours to remove the bodies.   Jim Rezka, project engineer, said he would favor installingremote-controlled methane monitoring equipment that would allowmeasurement of gas levels without workers having to enter the tunnel.   ``There's always a chance of human error,'' he said. ``There'd bea lot to be said for a (remote-controlled) monitoring system. Eventhough they were following a set procedure, anything could have setoff an explosion.''   The dead were identified as Ron Kohne, 49, tunnel superintendentfrom Big Sandy, Tenn.; Tony Bell, 25, shift foreman from SturgeonBay; and Rick Sochacki, 34, of Holland, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
