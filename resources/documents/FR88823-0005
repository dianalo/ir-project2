This action will allow for positivecontrol of aircraft operations in the vicinity of the airport during instrumentmeteorological conditions and enhance aviation safety in that area. Interestedparties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submittingwritten comments on the proposal to the FAA. One comment objecting to theproposal was received as a result of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.The commenter objected to positive control at this field. The FAA believesthis designation of a control zone will provide necessary protection toaircraft executing instrument approaches which have been developed forthe airport. An instrument approach procedure requires the designationof controlled airspace to protect aircraft utilizing the instrument approach.Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposedin the notice. Section 71.171 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6D dated January 4, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule </ITAG>This amendment of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations designatesa control zone to encompass airspace surrounding Boire Field, Nashua, NH.This action will allow for positive control of aircraft operations in thevicinity of the airport during instrument meteorological conditions andenhance aviation safety in that Area. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034); February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 7 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Control zone. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
