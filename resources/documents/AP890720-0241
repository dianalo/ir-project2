DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New York Stock Exchange can fine its memberbrokers who engage in securities fraud but the government cannot, asituation the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commissionwants to change.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a House subcommittee Wednesdaythat under current law, his agency can impose fines only in a fewinstances, mostly for insider trading.   But several self-regulating organizations overseen by his agency,including the National Association of Securities Dealers and theNYSE, have more authority to fine their members than the SEC does,he added.   ``And this legislation would remedy that disparity,'' said Ruder.   The chairman said the proposal to widen the scope of the SEC'sability to seek fines would give it and the courts more flexibilityto fit the penalty to the crime, take away much of the financialincentive for white collar crooks, discourage repeat offenders frombreaking the rules again, and help the government recoup some of themoney spent enforcing the law.   On another matter, Ruder told reporters after the hearing thathe's still ``waiting around'' for the White House to name hissuccessor.   Ruder, who announced plans in May to return to teaching law atNorthwestern University, said that despite the Bush administration'sinaction, ``I haven't made up my mind when I will leave.''   On the proposed legislation, SEC Enforcement Director Gary Lynchexplained that a change was needed because ``for all practicalpurposes, our fining authority is limited to insider trading.''   A 1988 law allows the SEC to seek civil fines of as much as threetimes the amount of illegal profits from those who trade illegallyon confidential information.   But in other SEC civil actions for stock manipulation orsecurities fraud ``there's no ability for a court to impose afine,'' said Lynch.   He noted that the SEC is empowered to seek restitution, calleddisgorgement, of illegal profits _ but not fines, which are now onlypossible after criminal convictions. But criminal cases must bebrought by the Justice Department.   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the HouseSubcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, noted that in fiscal1988, ``only 25 of the 252 enforcement cases initiated by the SECprimarilly involved insider trading.''   For most other civil violations, the SEC has only twoalternatives: seeking an injunction against further violations orsuspending a Wall Street firm's broker-dealer's license, whichMarkey termed ``the regulatory death penalty.''   Lynch, who is stepping down later this month after more than adozen years with the SEC, said that censure is not enough punishmentin many cases but suspending a broker-dealer's license ``even forone day'' would be going too far.   If one section of a large, multiservice firm violated securitieslaw ``it's not going to be appropriate to take actions that wouldaffect the entire firm _ not to mention that it would hurt thecustomers as well, leaving their accounts frozen for the day. Itreally isn't a viable alternative,'' said Lynch.   The new legislation also would empower the SEC to seek, eitherthrough an administrative proceeding or court order, a bar againstsecurity law violators serving as officers or directors of anySEC-registered company.   Outside the meeting room, Ruder, who previously said he wouldstay on at the SEC until a successor was named, said ``I suppose thefinal means of forcing some action would be for me to leave,''although he has not set a deadline for himself.   Ruder also said that no successor has been selected yet forLynch, who was repeatedly praised by subcommittee members at thehearing.   Lynch, who played a central role in breaking a series of insidertrading cases including stock speculator Ivan Boesky and investmentbanking giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said he would decide``within the next couple of days'' where he will work after leavingthe SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
