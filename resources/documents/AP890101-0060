The cathedral, like much of Managua, was destroyed in anearthquake shortly before the leftist Sandinistas took power in 1979and has not been rebuilt.   ``Will people continue to die in strange circumstances? Willkidnappings and manipulation of the pain of Nicaragua's motherscontinue?'' he asked.   The comment appeared to be a reference to charges publishedperiodically in the opposition newspaper La Prensa that the leftistSandinista government has committed human rights violations.   ``No,'' Obando y Bravo exclaimed to loud applause. ``This yearcannot be a copy of the one before because we are determined to makeit something new.''   He did not elaborate.   Obando y Bravo also attacked the government for limiting pressfreedom, saying there is no freedom of thought without freedom ofthe press.   The government has shut down La Prensa several times andsuspended broadcasts of several radio stations.   The New Year's mass, part of a ``day of peace'' declared by PopeJohn Paul II and also a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of theManagua archdiocese, was broadcast on the Roman Catholic radiostation Radio Catolica.   Church spokesman Monsignor Bosco Vivas said other stationsrefused to carry the service. He did not say why, but other sourcessaid they were acting under government orders.   Obando y Bravo is a frequent and outspoken critic of the leftistgovernment. He also heads a national commission that will overseeany peace accord reached by the government and the U.S.-backedContra rebels.   A cease-fire has been in place since March, but talks on apermanent end to the 8-year-old civil war broke down in September.</TEXT></DOC>
