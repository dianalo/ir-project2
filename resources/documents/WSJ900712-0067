Big Board volume rose to 162,220,000 shares from147,630,000 Tuesday, reflecting what several tradersdescribed as only a modest increase in activity byinstitutional investors despite the market's steep climb.   &quot;Certainly the volume doesn't show that institutions areheavily involved,&quot; said W. Daniel Williams III, a vicepresident of trading at Dillon, Read andamp; Co., adding that buyprograms linked to stock-index arbitrage &quot;were floatingaround, in and out, at different points of the day.&quot;   The bulk of the arbitrage-related buying -- purchasingbaskets of stocks and selling futures contracts to lock inprofits from differences in price between them -- hit themarket from midday onward, traders said.   Meanwhile, at least five major brokerage houses madefavorable comments on oil stocks following two developmentsthat pointed to a possible cutback in the world's oversupplyof petroleum:   -- News that oil ministers of five Persian Gulf nations,all members of OPEC, agreed that the cartel should maintainits current output ceiling of 22 million barrels a day untiloil prices rise to an &quot;acceptable&quot; level.   -- Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute thatshowed that inventories of crude oil fell nearly 3.7 millionbarrels last week, a sharper decline than expected.   The futures price of crude oil for August delivery went up53 cents a barrel in New York trading, to $17.47, afterclimbing 36 cents a barrel Tuesday. By comparison, the fiveOPEC oil ministers agreed that the current priority is torestore oil prices to &quot;at least&quot; $18 a barrel.   Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, saidboth oil stocks and oil prices may continue to advance if theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meetsJuly 25, can rein in overproduction among some of thecartel's members.
