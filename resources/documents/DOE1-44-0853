<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0853 </DOCNO><TEXT>Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) method was applied tomeasure major, minor and trace elements in 34 samples of hard and browncoal originating from eight Polish coal mines. The elemental concentrationsof 38 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, In, Sb, I, Cs, Ba, La, Ce,Sm, Eu, Lu, W, Au, and Th) are presented and compared with publisheddata for coals of various origin. Enrichment factors, calculated relativeto iron and the average crustal rock composition, indicate that severalelements are highly enriched in Polish coals. 22 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
