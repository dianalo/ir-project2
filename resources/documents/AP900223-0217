Among the flowers that still cover Joanne Reilly's hilltop gravein St. Peter's Cemetery are two small potted pines, one with a tinySanta Claus, and a big display saying ``Happy Birthday, Sis.''   Before her 21st birthday Sept. 24, relatives and friends filledthree columns of the Newry Reporter newspaper with memorials.
