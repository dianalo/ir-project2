The BHTI Part Number (P/N) 204-011-728grip assemblies have experienced corrosion pitting in the thread areasas a result of moisture in the grip cavities leading to eventual crackingand ultimate failure of the grip assemblies. Cracking has occurred in eightgrip assemblies on UH-1 series helicopters with four grip assemblies havingless than 400 hours' time in service. The P/N 204-011-728-1, -13, and -19grip assemblies are also used on civilian Model 204B, 205A, and 205A-1series helicopters.After further review, the manufacturer issued Bell Alert Service BulletinNo. 204-88-17, dated January 29, 1988, which reduces the retirement lifeof the Model 204B T/R grip assembly from 500 to 300 hours' time in service.The FAA has determined that this reduction in retirement life of the Model204B T/R grip assembly is necessary to assure the continued airworthinessof this aircraft. Failure of the T/R grip assembly would result in lossof the tail rotor blade and subsequent loss of the helicopter. Since this condition is likely to develop on other helicopters of the sametype design, an airworthiness directive is being issued which reduces theretirement life of the T/R grip assembly Part Number (P/N) 204-011-728(all dash numbers) from 500 to 300 hours' time in service on Bell HelicopterTextron, Inc., Model 204B, 205A, and 205A-1 helicopters; Garlick Helicopters,Hawkins and Powers Aviation, Inc., International Helicopters, Inc., PilotPersonnel International, Inc., and Southern Aero Corporation Model UH-1Bhelicopters; Smith Helicopters and West Coast Fabrications Model UH-1Ehelicopters; and Hercules and Oregon Helicopters Model UH-1L, TH-1L, andUH-1E helicopters. The retirement life of the T/R grip assembly P/N 204-011-728-19is reduced from 600 to 300 hours' time in service on California Departmentof Forestry Model UH-1F helicopters. A new replacement T/R grip assembly (P/N 205-011-711-101) having a 2,500hour service life is available. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable andgood cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilites among thevarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this actioninvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysis is not required).
