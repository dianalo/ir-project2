Even if the FDA advisory panel stops short of recommendingan outright ban on silicone gel implants, many in theindustry are bracing for sharp restrictions on the use of thebreast prostheses because of troubling safety questions.</LP><TEXT>   One reason for the industry's bleakness is a strongsuspicion among some executives that the FDA has skewed theproceedings of the advisory panel meeting -- due to starttoday -- to the industry's disadvantage. &quot;This really lookslike a total setup,&quot; Dennis Condon, president of MentorCorp.'s implant manufacturing unit, asserts after reviewing alist of witnesses and topics on the agenda.   What's more, the four manufacturers in the industry --Mentor, McGhan Medical Corp., Dow Corning Corp. and BioplastyInc. -- are dreading how their research, manufacturing andmarketing practices will be depicted when FDA inspectorsreport on their findings at the companies. For the past fiveweeks, the agency has had a squad of inspectors at eachcompany, scrutinizing operations and examining internaldocuments.   &quot;This hasn't been an inspection,&quot; complains Jan Varner,president of Inamed Corp.'s McGhan Medical. &quot;It has been aninquisition.&quot; He, for one, expects his company to be citedfor 100 to 150 deficiencies in product sterilization, qualitycontrol, record-keeping and other areas.   For their part, FDA officials deny any attempt topredetermine the outcome of the three-day meeting or toinfluence public perceptions of the industry. They contendthat extraordinary inspections were warranted in view of thecircumstances.   Not since the Dalkon Shield controversy of the 1970s has amedical device issue stirred such strong emotions -- orgenerated so much political pressure on the agency. The furorhas created camps with clashing opinions and now FDACommissioner David Kessler finds himself caught in themiddle. Among the varying voices are women who are satisfiedwith their implants and those who have had implant ruptures,immune-system disorders and other serious complications.   The advisory panel will vote Thursday on what course ofaction the FDA should take. Commissioner Kessler vows to actpromptly on its recommendation, particularly for the sake ofwomen who are awaiting reconstructive surgery with implantsfollowing mastectomies.   For the industry, the best scenario would be a repeat ofwhat happened last November, when the panel recommendedleaving silicone implants on the market to meet a &quot;publichealth need,&quot; despite a dearth of scientific data to provethey are indeed safe. Panel recommendations, while notbinding, customarily are heeded by the FDA.   But on Jan. 6, Dr. Kessler rejected the advisory panel'srecommendation in light of what he called &quot;new information,&quot;including case reports showing a possible link betweensilicone gel and immune-system disorders in women withimplants as well as a controversial batch of documents fromDow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and CorningInc.   What troubles the companies and the American Society ofPlastic and Reconstructive Surgeons is how the FDA hasorganized the three days of hearings and deliberations.Implant opponents, they complain, far outnumber implantadvocates.   The witness list includes Pierre Blais, a former Canadianhealth official who has been a leader in the anti-implantfight in that country, and Dan Bolton, a San Franciscoattorney who won a $7.3 million verdict in an implantliability case against Dow Corning.   Also scheduled to testify is Judy Destouet, an expert inmammography from Washington University, St. Louis, andcoinventor of an alternative to the silicone gel implant -- aprosthesis filled with peanut oil, which doesn't interferemuch with X-ray exams. She is expected to testify thatruptures frequently go undetected by mammography, makingclinical estimates of rupture rates unreliably low. A DowCorning study of 1,000 women with implants showed a rupturerate of only 1.1%.   One of the few witnesses on the pro-implant side will beRep. Marilyn Lloyd, a Tennessee Democrat who underwent breastcancer surgery last summer. &quot;I intend to have an implant withsilicone gel as soon as possible,&quot; she says. &quot;It's part ofthe healing process . . . I want to be myself again.&quot;   The panel will hear from several rheumatologists who willreport on their findings of a possible link between siliconeand so-called autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoidarthritis and scleroderma, a skin disorder. While majorepidemiological studies have yet to be done, the FDAnevertheless says the anecdotal case reports have &quot;heightenedconcern&quot; about the safety of silicone implants.   What's more, panel members already have been presentedwith a stack of business memos, scientific studies and otherdocuments that Dow Corning made public last week. &quot;Thesedocuments raise concern about rupture, bleed andquality-control problems,&quot; according to a FDA briefing bookfor panel members. They also &quot;highlight the absence ofadequate safety testing prior to the marketing of the 1975breast implant.&quot;   &quot;If this isn't a stacked exercise, I've never seen one,&quot;asserts Stuart Pape, lobbyist for the plastic surgeonssociety.   &quot;We don't think we'll get a fair hearing or that sciencewill prevail with the present format,&quot; adds McGhan's Mr.Varner. The company, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., sued theagency in an 11th hour attempt to have the issue turned overto Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan. ButFriday, a federal judge in Baltimore rejected the company'srequest for a temporary restraining order against the FDA.   FDA spokesman Don McLearn dismisses the bias charges asgroundless, pointing out that the only change in the advisorypanel that recommended keeping implants on the market hasbeen the demotion of panel member Norman Anderson, a JohnsHopkins University associate professor of medicine andsurgery, to a non-voting consultant. Mr. Anderson is anoutspoken critic of silicone implants.   For now, Bioplasty, based in Roseville, Minn., and DowCorning, are taking a less adversarial approach to the panelmeeting. &quot;We hope this hearing is part of the solution,&quot; saysBarbara Carmichael, a Dow Corning spokeswoman in Midland,Mich.   But many in the industry fear that the panel willrecommend limiting use of silicone prostheses to a fewthousand women participating in clinical trials. Suchrestricted use could force some companies to drop out of thesilicone implant business.   &quot;If you dramatically cut down the size of the market whilethe costs of research go up,&quot; says Mr. Pape, partner in thelaw firm Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow, &quot;it's hard to see how anymanufacturers will remain viable.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
