 It could also make it possible to quicklysettle &quot;who invented it first&quot; patent disputes.andM;&quot;In the past, investigators could always assume that tampering would leavetelltale signs in the medium -- i.e., the paper or ink,&quot; said co-inventorScott Stornetta.andP;  &quot;However, with electronic documents (data and text, as wellas digitized audio, video and photographs), there has never been a way toknow what part of a document is authentic, and what part has been alteredafter the fact.&quot;andM;&quot;With businesses storing more and more of their records electronically, thislack of security poses a serious threat,&quot; added co-inventor Stuart Haber.andO;Bellcore has applied for a patent on Stornetta's and Haber's method ofverifying the time and origin of electronic data:  a digital time-stampingservice (TSS) prototype.andP;  Conceivably, a subscriber to such an &quot;electronicnotary&quot; service could submit any type of document electronically fortime-stamping from anywhere in the world.andM;The TSS would return a digital &quot;receipt&quot; that could be used to prove adocument was created on, or before, a certain date and that it hadn't beentampered with anytime after.andP;  Under the proposed Bellcore system, evenchanging one character of the original would break the time-stamping seal.andM;&quot;There were two other challenges we faced to make the scheme cheat-proof,&quot;said Haber.andP;  &quot;In the case of an invention, a company would need to submit adescription of the product to a time-stamping agency to register the date.andO;Yet, it would want to keep the idea a secret, even from the TSS.andP;  So, thefirst challenge was to find a way to give someone a document fortime-stamping without letting him or her actually look at it.&quot;andM;Instead of transmitting an entire document, the Bellcore approach would sendthe time-stamping service only a small representation of the original.andP;  Thesample would be generated by one-way &quot;hashing&quot; -- a well-known mathematicalprocess that creates a unique digital &quot;fingerprint&quot; representative of theentire body of data.andP;  Hashing generates a random string of numbers unique tothe data as it exists at a given moment.andM;Thereafter, a change of even one character in the original would result in anentirely new set of numbers that would not match the original digitalfingerprint.andP;  The one-way hash function also makes it impossible to constructa full document from its hash value.andM;A second challenge, added Stornetta, was how to make it impossible foranyone, including the time-stamping service, to cheat.andP;  &quot;What's to stop aclient from bribing a TSS employee to make a tampered document look like theoriginal, or to backdate a document to make it appear that company &quot;A&quot;invented something before company &quot;B&quot;?andM;In Haber's and Stornetta's experimental TSS system, a data originator wouldsend the hash value of a document to a time-stamping service.andP;  The TSS wouldvalidate the time of arrival and incorporate its own unalterable identifier,or &quot;digital signature,&quot; into the hash value, much the way a notary publicwould stamp a paper document.andM;To prevent any possibility of back- or forward-dating, the Bellcore systemwould &quot;link&quot; each time-stamped &quot;receipt&quot; to the one immediately preceding itby including a portion of the previous client's time stamp and hash number.andO;This chaining together of data would make it impossible to insert anydocument after the fact, said Stornetta.andM;The Bellcore researchers have also proposed an alternate, or &quot;randomwitness,&quot; solution to prevent anyone from altering the time stamp.andP;  Using acryptographic tool known as a pseudo-random generator, the TSS would create alist of witnesses whose computers would automatically receive and time-stampa hash value, and add their own digital signature to the TSS receipt.andM;Neither clients nor the TSS could influence the selection of witnessesbecause, like the hash value, the randomly-generated list would be determinedby the original data.andM;Stornetta and Haber have also built in electronic safeguards that wouldenable TSS clients to insure that the TSS receipt itself is not counterfeit.andM;Bellcore is developing prototype software for its digital time stamp method,which the consortium intends to eventually make available for licensing.andM;The software will reside both in a client's personal computer and in the TSScomputer.andP;  The company plans to trial the experimental system internallyearly next year.andM;&quot;Phone companies are interested in digital time-stamping services not onlyfor internal operational purposes, but also because their introduction wouldresult in increased use of local telephone networks for time-stampingpurposes,&quot; Stornetta said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
