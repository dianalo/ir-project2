A number of analysts believe that after two years of bankruptcyreorganization, a massive restructuring and a new weekend trce withCarl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder, Texaco has emerged a leaner,more efficient company.   But there are questions about where the nation's third largestoil concern will go from here, and the extent of the benefit toshareholders from the latest move.   Pressure from Icahn to boost shareholder value or face a takeoverhad helped inflate the company's stock price over the last year fromabout $36, on speculation that he would mount a buyout attempt.   After a series of secret meetings with management, Icahn agreedthis weekend not to boost his 16.6 percent stake in Texaco for sevenyears or to make another takeover move. Texaco in turn agreed to pay$2.4 billion in special dividends to shareholders and to buy backsome of its stock.   Icahn stands to gain some $300 million if the plan is approved byshareholders.   On Monday, Texaco fell $4.25 a share to $50.25 in New York StockExchange composite trading as speculators sold off their stock,analysts said.   The agreement restricts how Icahn can dispose of his holdings,said Dennis O'Dea, attorney for Texaco's shareholder committee, whobelieves the agreement was ``a good compromise in response todifferent shareholder groups.''   While all shareholders would receive the dividend, Sarah Teslik,executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Council ofInstitutional Investors, said she sees the agreement as a type of``greenmail,'' because Icahn forced Texaco into a payout itotherwise would not have made.   Greenmail is an antitakeover maneuver in which the target companybuys back a raider's stock at a price higher than that paid to otherstockholders.   ``If it was done for shareholders, I don't know what theshareholder reasons are other than to get him (Icahn) off theirbacks,'' said Teslik, whose trade association represents 65 largepension funds with $300 billion in assets.   ``It's not clear that it's in the shareholders' interests to takemoney now or whether it can better be used in the long-term interestof the company,'' said Teslik.   Michael Young, an analyst with the investment firm Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., said the plan, which must receive shareholderapproval, was not the preferred route of Texaco management and thatthe prospect of a special dividend was orchestrated by demands fromIcahn.   Smith Barney on Monday lowered its rating of Texaco from a buystock to neutral, Young said.   ``We're hard-pressed to see how the company benefits in thelonger term,'' Young said.   Nevertheless, many analysts and investors believe Texaco haslearned from its mistakes and that with Icahn off its backmanagement can focus more on the oil business.   In the early 1980s, a struggling Texaco unable to find oil toreplace its dwindling reserves purchased the reserve-rich Getty OilCo. Pennzoil Co. sued claiming Texaco's acquisition interfered withits prior contract to buy Getty.   A Houston jury's $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco forced thecompany into bankruptcy to avoid posting a potentially ruinousmultibillion dollar security bond to continue its appeals of theaward. Shareholders helped force a reluctant management to settlewith Pennzoil for $3 billion, a key element in the company'sbankruptcy reorganization.   Almost immediately, a legion of disgruntled shareholders led byIcahn moved to wrest control of the company, claiming management wasnot doing enough to increase the value of the stock.   That pressure, spearheaded by Icahn, led to the currentrestructuring.   Last week, Texaco completed one of the final steps in itsrestructuring with the sale of its 78 percent stake in profitableTexaco Canada Inc. for nearly $4 billion, including specialdividends. With the sale of its Deutsche Texaco A.G. for $1.2billion and 50 percent of its refining and marketing assets to SaudiArabia as well as smaller properties, Texaco will collect more than$7 billion in proceeds.   ``I think it's going to become an operating company now,'' saidEarl Gould, portfolio manager and energy analyst with AtlanticRichfield Co. in Los Angeles, which owns 100,000 shares of Texacostock.   But while the restructuring leaves Texaco on sounder footing, itremains to be seen whether it will be a competitor in the oilbusiness in the 1990s.   ``The real dilemma for thisas to find oil. Thatwill determine its future value,'' Young said.</TEXT></DOC>
