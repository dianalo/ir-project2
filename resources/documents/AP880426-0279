It's the granddaddy of all Mexican beers, a golden brew thathelped turn a small brewery into a major corporation and a sleepytown into an industrial giant.   Monterrey has come a long way since the fledgling CuauhtemocBrewery first put a cap on a bottle of Carta Blanca nearly acentury ago.   A sprawling city of 2.8 million people today, Monterrey had just40,000 inhabitants and a few small factories in 1890 when a groupof local investors started the brewery, named for the last Aztecemperor, Cuauhtemoc _ pronounced Cwow-tay'-moc.   ``It was contagious,'' said the historian and author IsraelCavazos. ``The enthusiasm to create other industries caught on.''   The brewery's needs were large at the turn of the century and itwasn't easy to get raw materials from Mexico City 600 miles to thesouth or from the United States 150 miles north.   Cuauhtemoc's directors created departments to manufacture theraw materials: malt, glass to make bottles, tin for caps, paper forlabels, cardboard for cases.   Those departments spawned seven incorporated industries thatlater became catalysts for the major industrial conglomerates Visa,Alfa and Vitro.   ``The brewery was the cornerstone of Monterrey's industrialdevelopment,'' said Jorge Montemayor, Cuauhtemoc's planningdirector.   The brewery, now a division of Visa, started operations with 72workers in a house in what is now downtown Monterrey. It produced1,500 bottles of Carta Blanca the first year.   By 1987, Cuauhtemoc's seven breweries throughout Mexico had4,409 employees producing about 1 billion quarts of beer each year.   In addition to Carta Blanca, still one of Mexico's most popularbeers, Cuauhtemoc makes Tecate and Chihuahua beers, itsbest-selling export products.   Its premium Bohemia brand won first prize among 35 domestic andforeign lager beers in a Los Angeles Times Magazine beer-tastingcontest last summer.   If Cuauhtemoc launched what is known as the ``Monterreyphenomenon'' _ the unique industrial development of a city so farfrom the nation's capital _ it also led the way in social andeducational development programs for employees.   Before the government created a federal medical program,families of Cuauhtemoc employees were receiving free medical careat company clinics. Before the federal government started low-costhousing programs, the company was helping its employees build theirhomes.   In 1912 the brewery founded Monterrey's Cuauhtemoc PolytechnicSchool, which offered primary level classes to employees' childrenduring the day and to workers at night. The Monterrey TechnologicalInstitute, now one of Mexico's leading universities, developed fromthe school.   Today, the brewery also provides free dental care, low-interestloans, savings programs and university scholarships. Its sports andcultural center sponsors soccer teams and offers classes inswimming, karate, singing, dancing and guitar.   Erik Eduardo Larsen, whose grandfather came to Monterrey fromDenmark in the early 1930s to take a job at the Cuauhtemoc brewery,is the third generation of Larsens to work here.   ``The company doesn't think just about production. It'sconcerned with people, too,'' said the 22-year-old systems analystwhose father was Cuauhtemoc's production chief.   ``It's like a family here,'' he said. ``And the pay is betterthan at other companies.''   Salaries for laborers start 30 percent higher than Monterrey'sdaily minimum wage of 7,405 pesos, about $3.20.   The current economic crisis, however, has been tough on thelocal beer industry, and the brewery is operating at a loss.   In 1983, the year after the crisis began, Cuauhtemoc's domesticsales dropped by nearly 1.3 million cases as consumers watchedtheir salaries eaten up by soaring inflation.   Last year, however, the brewery achieved pre-crisis productionlevels and is negotiating with foreign creditors to restructuredebts while pushing exports to generate U.S. dollars.   Although the immense popularity of Corona Extra beer in theUnited States has made Cuauhtemoc's main competitor, the Modelobrewery, even stronger, planning director Montemayor said hiscompany is reaping some benefits from it.   ``Corona's success has helped us, too. It's made the Americanconsumer more aware of Mexican beer,'' he said.   An aggressive sales and distribution campaign, coupled with anew American thirst for Mexican beer, has helped Cuauhtemoc morethan double its exports sales since the economic crisis began.   In 1987 Cuauhtemoc exported 4.7 million cases of beer,generating $29.2 million.   Cuauhtemoc, with 33 percent of the domestic beer market, is thesecond largest of Mexico's three beer manufacturers after theModelo brewery.   In 1985, the financially troubled Moctezuma brewery was acquiredby Visa's holding company Fomento Proa in an exchange of stock thatprevented Modelo from acquiring it and becoming a force too largeto deal with in the Mexican beer industry, said Montemayor.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday May 1</NOTE></DOC>
