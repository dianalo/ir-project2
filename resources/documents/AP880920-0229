The Democratic Coordinate's last rally, on July 10, ended in abloody clash between police and protesters.   Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the permit for Sunday'splanned march was denied because the protest was intended ``tocreate disturbances.''   The opposition coalition protested the decision.   ``Political groups should have access to the means ofcommuncation, take part in the right of association and the abilityto hold public manifestations,'' Duilio Baltodano, a DemocraticCoordinate leader, was quoted as saying by the newspaper La Prensalate Tuesday.   The opposition coalition is made up of opposition politicalparties and organizations. Forty opposition figures were arrestedduring the previous rally and face criminal charges.   Borge acknowledged during a news conference Tuesday that thedenial of the march permit left the government open to criticism.   But he added: ``It would be worse and would be a largerpolitical cost and a greater pretext for our enemy and more of anargument for aid to the Contras (the U.S.-supported rebels) ifthere were provocations here that led to bloodshed in the streetsof Managua.''   In Washington Tuesday, House Speaker Jim Wright said the CIAadmitted in congressional testimony that it used undercover agentsin Nicaragua to stir up public protest, hoping the leftistgovernment would overreact.   Wright, D-Texas, said he did not know if the July 10demonstration in Nandaime, south of Managua, was the result of U.S.provocations.   Scores of people suffered injuries in the Nandaime rally.Witnesses saw police beat, kick and shove demonstrators with riflebutts. Officials were injured by rocks hurled by the protesters.   The Sandinistas later claimed the U.S. Embassy backed the marchand charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine thegovernment. The following day, the U.S. Ambassador, Richard Melton,was expelled from the country.   La Prensa was suspended for 15 days and the Roman Catholic radiostation was temporarily shut down.   Government officials recently have charged that the UnitedStates seeks to justify a reason to approve renewed military aidfor the rebels, who have been fighting to oust the Sandinistassince 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
