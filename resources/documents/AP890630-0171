The communist-led Coalition of Left and Progress, whose failurefollows similar attempts by the socialists and conservatives, leftopen the possibility of joining with the center-right New Democracyparty of Constantine Mitsotakis.   ``We (the Coalition) will meet tomorrow and examine the prospectsof such a government and take the proper position,'' Coalitionleader Harilaos Florakis said after meeting with President ChristosSartzetakis.   Negotiations on a coalition began after elections June 18 inwhich New Democracy won 145 of the unicameral Parliament's 300seats, six short of a majority, and Papandreou's PanhellenicSocialist Movement got 125.   The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of theMoscow-line Communist Party and the Greek Left, a Eurocommunistgroup, won 28 seats and the role of power broker. They a received athree-day mandate ending Friday to form a government.   Sartzetakis has a final meeting with party leaders Saturday. Ifthe communists and conservatives reach agreement, they could stillpresent a proposed coalition government to the president forapproval.   If the parties are unable to hammer out a government acceptableto all, Sartzetakis is to appoint a caretaker administrationcomposed of high court judges and non-parliamentarians to lead thecountry to new elections.   The earlier efforts by conservatives and socialists to form agovernment by cooperating with the communists stumbled overMitsotakis' and Papandreou's insistence on being premier. The twoleaders backed down on that demand Friday.   Papandreou is hospitalized, recovering from heart and kidneyproblems.   It was the first time in the nation's history that communistshave been given a mandate to form a government.</TEXT></DOC>
