The plan essentially would create a cartel of 21 OPEC and non-OPEC exporters -- with the discreet, if not open, backing of Norway and the Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer.    Mr. Deuss, a 45-year-old Dutchman who owns a refinery and more than 1,000 gasoline stations on the U.S. East Coast, is described as a &quot;statesman&quot; of world oil by acquaintances. Mr. Deuss, whose trading operation is known as Transworld Oil, refuses to take any credit for the plan to create, in effect, a &quot;World OPEC&quot; that would limit production in times of glut.    Whether the plan comes to fruition is up to the 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, who are meeting here this week. Their agenda is full of other nettlesome issues, and scant attention is being given a recent proposal by several non-OPEC exporters to share production cuts to trim the world oil glut. The consensus among the ministers last night was that current OPEC production quotas probably will be kept intact for the third quarter and possibly for all of the second half.    But their continuing deliberations over allying with non-OPEC nations ensures that the proposition will remain alive. &quot;We're delighted that the ice has been broken,&quot; says Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president, who sees long-term cooperation among oil exporters to stabilize petroleum prices.    Both Mr. Lukman and Mr. Deuss, whose base is Bermuda, were speakers at an &quot;Oil andamp; Money&quot; conference in London last October, at which the trader promoted the idea that effective &quot;supply management&quot; to balance oil markets would come about only through the cooperation of all the world's leading oil exporters, including the Soviet Union.    Although he denies it, evidence suggests Mr. Deuss had more to do with the idea than just a speech. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but replied in writing to submitted questions.    &quot;I have not played a role in the formulation of a proposal by non-OPEC to OPEC to coordinate production cuts,&quot; says Mr. Deuss. &quot;It is a matter of record that for quite some time now there has been an active dialogue between non-OPEC and OPEC. The reason is obvious. Both are interested in oil-price stability.&quot;    Whether or not Mr. Deuss directly participated in formulating the proposal, he is credited with helping overcome the inertia that had limited cooperation in the past.    The concept of an OPEC/non-OPEC alliance was born about the time Mr. Deuss had accumulated stunning losses from a huge &quot;long&quot; position, in which he had purchased, for delivery in January, all the crude available on the North Sea Brent market -- some 25 million barrels. Including carrying costs of unsold crude, estimates are he had a $200 million loss.    &quot;John Deuss has been pivotal in pushing the (OPEC/non-OPEC) factions into getting together since last year,&quot; says Nauman Barakat, vice president of futures trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;He was long the market, and any sort of dialogue would firm the market.&quot;    In his written comments, Mr. Deuss says, &quot;There was no connection between Transworld's January Brent positions and the OPEC/non-OPEC plan, whatever that may be.&quot; Other Transworld officials also deny any such connection.    Indeed, most participants trace the origins of the idea to a later point, in February, during the so-called IP Week in London, when oil men and government officials came from around the world for several days of social gatherings, deal-making and conferences sponsored by the British Institute of Petroleum. The initiative was made by the non-OPEC producers and was led by Oman, which Mr. Deuss serves as oil adviser.    The idea was articulated in London by Herman Franssen, a former chief economist of the International Energy Agency. He is now economic adviser to Said bin Ahmed Al-Shanfari, the oil minister of Oman -- a role for which he was handpicked by Mr. Deuss, who flew him to Oman to introduce him to Mr. Al-Shanfari.    &quot;Herman Franssen started the scheme,&quot; asserts Tore Tonne, a representative of the Norwegian Oil Ministry who was present when the project was launched. Mr. Franssen declines to comment on any connections with Mr. Deuss.    &quot;After the intiative came from Oman,&quot; another participant in the London meetings recalls, &quot;it spread to the inner group of countries which had sent observers to OPEC meetings in prior years,&quot; including such non-OPEC nations as Mexico, Angola and Malaysia. There was rapport among these countries, and then China and Colombia became involved.&quot; And Mr. Franssen soon was off to Moscow to talk to the Soviets about their support.    It was at about this time, industry sources say, that Mr. Deuss wrote Hisham M. Nazer, oil minister of Saudi Arabia, offering a plan that he said could help OPEC. It is understood that Mr. Nazer was peeved, replying that Mr. Deuss stay out of the sovereign business of the kingdom. Perhaps it was only coincidence, but the kingdom and Kuwait subequently were instrumental in blocking OPEC from making a quick counteroffer to the non-OPEC proposal in early May.    The proposal, presented in meetings here beginning in late April, eventually was stalled by debate over what share of the total production cuts OPEC should absorb -- and, of that total, how the cuts should be distributed within OPEC.    Although the OPEC nations didn't like the terms of the proposal, they like the idea. But they probably won't do much with it at this meeting. Mr. Franssen continues to coordinate communications between the two groups and is back in Vienna awaiting any response OPEC may care to make. </TEXT></DOC>
