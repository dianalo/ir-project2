The court also maintained a freeze on the couple's suspectedmultibillion-dollar worldwide holdings.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Marcos' position as aformer foreign leader did not protect him from lawsuits in U.S.courts.   The ``act of state'' doctrine, which prohibits U.S. judicialreview of sovereign acts by another nation, ``is not a promise tothe ruler of any foreign country that his conduct, if challenged byhis own country after his fall, may not become the subject ofscrutiny in our courts,'' said the opinion by Judge John Noonan.   ``The doctrine is meant to facilitate the foreign relations ofthe United States, not to furnish the equivalent of sovereignimmunity to a deposed leader.''   Noonan said the lawsuit filed by the new Philippine government ofCorazon Aquino has ``a fair chance of succeeding.''   Marcos, 71, fled Hawaii in February 1986 after amilitary-civilian revolt ended his 20-year rule. The couple has beenliving in Hawaii since then.   They were indicted Oct. 21 on criminal racketeering chargesaccusing them of plundering the Philippines' treasury and stashingmuch of the money in the United States.   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New Yorkand was released on $5 million bail. Marcos, who is reportedly inpoor health, has not appeared in court.   Ronald Olson, a lawyer for the Aquino government, called thedecision to continue a freeze on the Marcoses' holdings ``acritically important affirmation of the courageous ruling ... whichhopefully has held in place the monies that Marcos has secretedaway.''   The lawsuit on behalf of the Philippine people contends thecouple used the proceeds of Marcos' alleged looting to invest inU.S. property, both before and after he was deposed.   In addition, the lawsuit claims the couple hid other stolenassets in Swiss banks and elsewhere _ at least $1.5 billion andperhaps as much as $20 billion, according to a lawyer for the Aquinogovernment.   Claiming violations of U.S. racketeering laws, as well as bribes,theft, extortion, conspiracy and other violations in thePhilippines, the lawsuit seeks return of the property plus $50billion in punitive damages.   Lawyers for the Marcoses have contended the civil lawsuit belongsin Philippine courts. They also argue that the lawsuit raisesessentially political questions requiring a U.S. court to decide thelegality of Marcos' rule, issues beyond the competence of judges.   Noonan said the lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that a court canevaluate.   ``Bribetaking, theft, embezzlement, extortion, fraud andconspiracy to do these things are all acts susceptible of concreteproofs that need not involve political questions,'' he said.   U.S. courts are capable of interpreting Philippine law and ``havehad no difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposedruler from his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law,''the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
