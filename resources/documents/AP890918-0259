The solar cell is the most efficient ever produced, according togovernment experts. In other words, it produces the most electricityfor the amount of sunshine it receives of any cell.   Boeing's research was aimed at improving the power supply forspacecraft, but the new cell is so efficient it may have spinoffbenefits, scientists say.   ``We were interested in space applications,'' said RogerGillette, a manager in the lab where the device was devloped. ``Thisappears to have spinoff benefits, but at present we have no productobjectives'' for uses on Earth.   The new cell was designed in the Boeing High Technology Center'smaterials and devices laboratory.   Low efficiencies of solar power and high costs have limited itsuse mainly to space applications or remote areas on Earth whereconventional power is unavailable or is extremely expensive.   Boeing's solar cell, which achieved an efficiency of 37 percentin laboratory tests, converts sunshine directly into electricity.NASA has confirmed the 37 percent efficiency, said Boeing spokesmanDavid Suffia.   The previous record was 31 percent, accomplished last year atSandia National Laboratory in Albuqueruqe, N.M. The Sandia cell'sefficiency was considered phenomenal by experts in the solar-energyfield.   Efficiency is the ratio of electricity produced to the solarenergy received on the cell's surface.   ``The Boeing work is a surprise,'' said Don Schueler, manager ofsolar programs at Sandia. ``Our work last year was considered a realbenchmark, like the first running of the four-minute mile.''   The development is ``a significant step forward,'' Schueler said.``We didn't expect such a big step so soon.''   But Schueler noted that efficiency is not the only importantfactor when considering commercial applications for solar cells.   ``There are many other things like cost, producibility,performance, that are important with regard to commercialdevelopment,'' he said.   Solar energy plants are used primarily by power utilities insunny parts of the country to supplement the output of coal ornuclear plants during peak demand. They average less than 15 percentefficiency.   Doubling that efficiency would cut in half the size of the solarpanels required to produce the same amount of power. That would alsoreduce the amount of land needed for a plant.   Smaller solar panels in spacecraft would reduce both weight andcosts.   Boeing has sent some of its solar cells to Sandia, where theywill be evaluated in the New Mexico sunshine, and to NASA's LewisResearch Center in Cleveland, where they will be flown in jets abovemuch of the atmosphere for testing.</TEXT></DOC>
