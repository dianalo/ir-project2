Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont and Akzo, a Dutch chemical concern, agreed to an out-of-court settlement that will permit both companies to manufacture and distribute the fibers world-wide. Suits pending in 20 different courts in the U.S. and overseas will be terminated, Du Pont said.    Du Pont officials said they consider the agreement &quot;an attractive alternative&quot; to litigation because it removes uncertainty in the market. The legal tangles were causing customer confusion and anxieties over continuity of supply, said John Fallon, director of Du Pont's industrial products division.    Mr. Fallon said he expects the truce to expand demand for the fibers and doesn't anticipate the resulting increased competition from Akzo to cut into Du Pont's markets. Du Pont has annual Kevlar sales of about $300 million, mostly in the U.S.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Du Pont's stock closed at $83.25, up 50 cents.    Aramid fibers, the family of synthetic materials that include Kevlar and Twaron, are five times stronger than steel and have growing industrial applications in automotive, aerospace and construction materials sectors. Kevlar is used in bullet-resistant vests and army helmets. Du Pont and Akzo are the world's primary manufacturers of aramid fibers.    The International Trade Commission has restricted Akzo from selling Twaron in the U.S. until 1990. Under the agreement with Du Pont, Akzo will be able to export to the U.S. but will continue to have some restrictions on the shipments, Du Pont said.    Du Pont began the legal battle in 1979 by suing Akzo in the United Kingdom for patent infringement. Earlier this year, a judge in Britain ruled that Du Pont had been violating Akzo's patent in Britain on a key solvent used in manufacturing Twaron. Du Pont plans to begin production of Kevlar this summer at a plant under construction in Northern Ireland. </TEXT></DOC>
