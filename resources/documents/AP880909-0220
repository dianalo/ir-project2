Inc., a California-based company that thegovernment says was a victim of insider trading by Drexel.   Wickes said Thursday it did not expect civil insider trading andfraud charges against Drexel to have any effect on a proposedleveraged buyout that depends $423 million in financing through anissue of junk bonds by Drexel.   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Wednesday thatDrexel acted behind Wickes' back in 1986 while Wickes was tryingunsuccessfully to take over National Gypsum Co. The charge was partof a broader civil suit brought by the SEC accusing Drexel andothers of numerous securities frauds.   ``Obviously if the charges are ultimately proven, this would bedistressing,'' said Wickes spokesman Michael Sitrick.   ``However, based on our current knowledge of the situation wewould not anticipate that the filing of this complaint will haveany negative impact on our relationship with Drexel or any of itspeople with whom we work,'' Sitrick said.   Wickes, a building-supplies retailing company based in SantaMonica, Calif., on Aug. 21 announced plans for a management-ledbuyout that values the company at about $600 million.   Drexel is the dealer-manager and investment banker on thetransaction, which is being held open until Oct. 20 while Bear,Stearns andamp; Co. searches for bidders that might be willing to offermore than the management-led group.   The SEC charged that Drexel, Michael Milken, who is head of itsjunk-bond business, and his brother Lowell Milken secretly used theorganization of speculator Ivan Boesky to improperly sell Wickescommon stock for Drexel's benefit.   The government also alleged that Drexel, Michael Milken andMilken associate Cary Maultasch used Boesky's organization to buystock in National Gypsum ``in breach of fiduciary duties owed ...to Wickes.''   Drexel made about $6.7 million off the illicit purchases whilebeing paid about $1 million for its services by Wickes, the SECsaid.   Even though Wickes' bid for National Gypsum failed, the episodewas not a loss because Wickes came away with a profit of $3 millionafter selling its shares back at a higher price than it paid forthem.   Maxxam Industries Inc. of Los Angeles, which the SEC said alsowas cheated by Drexel, declined comment Thursday on theallegations. The SEC said Drexel used the Boesky organization tobuy for Drexel the stock of Pacific Lumber Co., which was thetarget of a Maxxam tender offer in 1985.   The complaint says Drexel received more than $22 million in feesfrom Maxxam for services rendered in connection with itsacquisition of Pacific Lumber.   Drexel was supported Wednesday by Triangle Industries Inc.,which has floated about $1.8 billion in junk bonds through Drexelfor various deals over the past five years.   Drexel's dealings with Triangle were not named in the SECcomplaint.   ``We're standing behind Drexel at this point, certainly. We donot intend to stop doing business with a firm on the basis of anSEC complaint, especially one we've had such a long and fruitfulrelationship with,'' said Triangle spokesman Mark Dorsett.</TEXT></DOC>
