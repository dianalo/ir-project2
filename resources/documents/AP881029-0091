Afghan guerrillas who are battling the Kremlin-backed Kabulregime say the Soviets have based two squadrons of MiG-27 Flogger-Dclose air support fighters at Shindand, 100 miles south of Herat infar western Afghanistan near the Iranian border, said one official.   The MiG-27s are suited for offensive operations, whereas theSoviet Union has said that it would undertake military operations inAfghanistan only to protect its own troops from attack.   ``We are investigating,'' said one U.S. official, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``Certainly, the introduction of offensiveequipment into Afghanistan could be viewed as a violation of theagreements. But there are legal technicalities in every agreement.''   Under the Geneva withdrawal accords signed last spring, theSoviets are obliged to pull out their entire occupation force, onceestimated at 115,000 troops.   Soviet officials have said the withdrawal timetable wasjeopardized by continued U.S. and Pakistani support for resistanceunits, who are operating with increasing boldness deep insideAfghanistan, launching repeated rocket attacks on the capital.   A second State Department official, also speaking on condition ofanonymity, said that the MiG-27s are believed to have replaced twosquadrons of older MiG-23 Flogger fighters. Each squadron has 12-15planes, according to David Isby, author of ``Russia's War inAfghanistan.''   The U.S. official repeated the Reagan administration formula onAfghanistan that ``we still expect the Soviets to be out by Feb.15,'' as called for under the Geneva accords.   The New York Times, which reported the presence of the MiG-27'sin Saturday's editions, quoted an unidentified U.S. officialpredicting the Soviets might resume offensive operations inAfghanistan.   The presence of the MiG-27s was reported by resistance unitsfighting in the area and has not been confirmed independently byU.S. diplomats, who are restricted largely to Kabul, the Afghancapital. The Times quoted officials as saying the sighting wasconfirmed by satellite photos.   The Soviets have had two or three squadrons of MiG-23 warplanesin Afghanistan since at least 1984, and may have had MiG-27's thereas well, according to Isby.   The MiG-23 and MiG-27 use the same basic air frames, but theforward fuselage, air intakes and weapons mounts of the MiG-27enable it to carry air-to-ground missiles and maneuver at subsonicspeeds to support ground forces, according to ``Jane's All TheWorld's Fighting Aircraft,'' an authoritative reference.   Earlier this week, the chairman of the Afghan resistancealliance, Burhanuddin Rabbani, said the Soviets were deploying newhigh-altitude Tu-16 bombers in Afghanistan. The Times said StateDepartment officials denied that assertion.</TEXT></DOC>
