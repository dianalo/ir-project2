(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen vowed today to``take them on'' and answer every negative Republican campaignadvertisement, despite his acknowledged risk that the fight-backstrategy might obscure the Democrats' broader message.   ``I'm going to take myself on an assignment,'' he told workersat a huge General Electric appliance plant here. ``Every time theyissue a falsehood ... I'm going to take them on and straighten thatone out.''   Bentsen said the presidential campaign should be fought overissues like health, housing and America's economic future. But hesaid the Republicans instead were distorting the prison furloughissue and lying about Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' positionon gun controls.   Bentsen, a World War II veteran, said he took it ``as a personalinsult to me'' that the Republicans were trying to portray Dukakisas weak on defense.   ``We have seen the Republicans running on symbols and twistingthe facts,'' said Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidentialcandidate.   ``We're going to tell them that you can't devalue the currencyof our democracy,'' he said.   Bentsen spoke after touring the dishwasher plant that is part ofa giant GE complex employing more than 13,000 people. He shookhands with workers and viewed robot equipment that has helped boostplant productivity and profits.   Bentsen told reporters Wednesday that the GOP's negativecampaign ads were ``an outrage.''   He cited the script of a new commercial featuring Dukakis ridingin a battle tank and claiming that the Massachusetts governoropposed every new defense program, which Bentsen said was``completely untrue.''   From Louisville, Bentsen headed for Texas to take part in anhour-long national student satellite teleconference from CorpusChristi State University.   In the teleconference, Bentsen will answer questions fromstudents from 26 colleges in 11 states. Those scheduled toparticipate at campuses around the country included the Rev. JesseJackson and Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee at Memphis State and formerKentucky Gov. Martha Layne Collins at the University of Kentucky.Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton was to serve as moderator.   Although Bentsen says he'd rather spend his time discussing homeownership, trade, education, and other Democratic issues, heconceded those messages were not yet getting through. His attacklines, meanwhile, are proving popular at rallies where the crowdsseem more pumped up than before.   A Louisville crowd roared Wednesday night when Bentsen describedhis opinion of how the Republicans have distorted Dukakis' record.``Down in Texas, we'd say they painted him lower than a snake'sbelly in a wagon rut,'' he said.   Bentsen met briefly with reporters on Wednesday before leavingCalifornia, where he unveiled his new tactics. He acknowledged theRepublican campaign was working and it showed in the polls.   ``That's why I finally had enough, because apparently these kindof charges when they're not answered, even though they are asludicrous as they are, have some damaging effect,'' he said.   ``I'm not going to put up with it any more,'' he said. ``I'mgoing to take them head on every time they distort the truth''through election day.   ``This is my idea,'' Bentsen said. ``This is not something I wasasked to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
