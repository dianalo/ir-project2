The budget projects a deficit of $129.5 billion for fiscal 1989. But many administration officials concede that the estimate is based on optimistic assumptions about economic growth and interest rates. The Congressional Budget Office looks instead for a $176 billion deficit. And even that pessimistic projection doesn't allow for a serious recession, which budget experts say could quickly push the deficit back beyond $200 billion.    The vexatious budget problem, leaders in both parties agree, will almost certainly be a first order of business for the winnner of this year's presidential sweepstakes.    &quot;The next president, whether Democrat or Republican, will have to be willing to spend some of his mandate on a quick, comprehensive solution&quot; to the deficit, says Richard Darman, a deputy Treasury secretary earlier in the Reagan administration. &quot;It's the only thing he will be able to do in his first term,&quot; argues Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, &quot;and if he doesn't do it, he won't have a second term.&quot;    Most of the presidential candidates from both parties have made deficit reduction a key plank in their economic platforms. But they have also shied away from the painful specifics, and in some cases they have made promises (such as pledges by Vice President George Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York not to raise taxes) that could make it difficult to deal successfully with the deficit problem once they were elected.    But the new president may get some help from the National Economic Commission, a blue-ribbon panel set up by Congress that must propose a deficit-reduction plan by March 1, 1989. The president and congressional leaders may be able to use that commission's recommendations to shield themselves from political attack. &quot;They can say, 'The commission made me do it,'&quot; Sen. Moynihan suggests.    The president's budget for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1, was drafted along the lines prescribed by last year's &quot;summit&quot; agreement between the administration and Congress. As a result, it contains few surprises, and it is expected to generate little controversy.    The White House and Congress may wrangle over the president's proposed new cutbacks in the Medicare program. And they will undoubtedly disagree over some of the administration's spending priorities. But after seven years of fierce battles, an eerie quiet is likely to fall on the budget front during this election year.    The one hang-up could come in August, when the White House budget office is required by law to determine whether Congress will hit the fiscal 1989 goal of $136 billion set in the revised Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Slow economic growth in the first half of this year could make that goal elusive and force the administration and Congress to look for new deficit cuts.    Congressional budget leaders, however, doubt that will happen. With an election approaching, Congress has little desire to take on tough deficit-cutting issues. And because the revised Gramm-Rudman law gives the White House budget office full power to set the economic assumptions that underlie the deficit projections, the administration can probably avoid another showdown simply by assuming better economic performance in the future.    Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the budget committee, says that he therefore doesn't see much likelihood that further deficit-reduction efforts will occur this year.    That puts the problem on the new president's doorstep. Numbers of the White House budget office show the deficit declining gradually to a benign $23.3 billion in fiscal 1993. But few budget experts either inside or outside the administration put much stock in those estimates, which are based on the assumption that robust economic growth will continue without interruption for the next six years. Because the current economic expansion is already more than five years old -- longer than any other peacetime expansion in U.S. history -- many economists predict a recession this year or next.    &quot;Sooner or later we will have a recession,&quot; says Carol Cox, who heads a private, bipartisan group called the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. &quot;And even a very mild, very modest recession will send the deficit back up over $200 billion almost overnight.&quot; Sen. Moynihan says a deep recession could send the deficit to $300 billion &quot;with no problem at all.&quot;    The trick for the new president will be to devise a solution for the deficit quandary before that recession occurs. &quot;They've got to do it in the first six months,&quot; says Stephen Bell, former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. &quot;At that point, the permanent bureaucracy hasn't yet had a chance to co-opt the new political appointees.&quot;    The solution, however, won't be easy. The least painful deficit-cutting measures have been thoroughly mined in the budget wars of the past seven years. Only tough choices remain.    Most budget experts agree that any credible solution to the deficit problem will have to attack two political sacred cows: taxes and Social Security.    &quot;We all know what's required. It's a simple proposition. It doesn't take a genius,&quot; says one high-ranking administration official, a veteran of the Reagan budget wars. &quot;The Republicans have to put taxes on the table, and the Democrats have to put entitlements on the table.&quot;    Mr. Reagan's opposition to tax increases, combined with congressional resistance to further cuts in non-defense spending, has made it impossible to put together a significant budget compromise. In his budget message yesterday, Mr. Reagan admitted that persistently large deficits could endanger the lower tax rates and substantial economic improvements of his presidency. But he stressed the need to lower the deficit by cutting spending. &quot;If the deficit is not curbed by limiting the appetite of government, we put in jeopardy what we have worked so hard to achieve,&quot; he said.    Budget cutters may actually manage to squeeze some more money out of &quot;discretionary&quot; domestic spending programs, such as education and space research. But since the amount appropriated for those programs will total only $147.6 billion in fiscal 1989, such cuts won't go far toward solving a $100 billion to $200 billion deficit problem. Defense spending, which will total $294 billion in fiscal 1989, might also be a candidate for some trimming, although the Pentagon is already screaming about the relatively flat trend of defense expenditures over the past three years.    That leaves Social Security, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's $1.1 trillion budget. And it leaves taxes. &quot;It's eighth-grade arithmetic,&quot; says Ms. Cox. &quot;Taxes and Social Security. That's where the money is.&quot;    One reason Congress created the National Economic Commission was to reduce the political fallout such tough measures would cause. &quot;I think this economic commission is the best hope we have,&quot; says member Robert Strauss, a Washington lawyer and often-consulted political adviser. &quot;It's going to be distinguished, it's going to be bipartisan, and it will provide the president the political cover he needs to take on some of these things.&quot;    In addition to Mr. Strauss, Democratic members named by congressional leaders include Sen. Moynihan, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, New York financier Felix Rohatyn, House Budget Chairman William Gray III and AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland. The GOP members haven't yet been named. But congressional Republicans are expected to include Sen. Domenici among their four choices, and the White House is expected to name former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis as one of its two appointees. The newly elected president will also be allowed to name two members to the commission after the November election.    Whether this ruse will work is by no means clear. Proponents of the commission like to point to the panel headed by Alan Greenspan that was instrumental in overhauling the Social Security program in 1983. But various government officials who worked on the Social Security panel say it included representatives of all the principal constituency groups involved in the Social Security debate. The new commission, they argue, is far less representative.    &quot;It's going to be very difficult for Republicans to embrace cuts in Social Security, for instance, just because Felix Rohatyn and Lee Iacocca say they're for it,&quot; one administration official says.    In addition, the commission can be successful only if the new president is seriously interested in seeing its proposals enacted. The danger, says Ms. Cox, is that candidates will get themselves backed into corners that restrict their ability to act. Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, for instance, faces pressures to oppose tax increases; some analysts say the perception that he is &quot;waffling&quot; on the tax question contributed to his recent loss to Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Even if the National Economic Commission provides some political cover, a new president may be unwilling to see his campaign promises destroyed and his credibility damaged.    A recession could also make deficit reduction more difficult. Policy makers will be reluctant to raise taxes or cut spending in the midst of a downturn.    Even if a recession hasn't already occurred, the administration and Congress will have to be careful not to cut the deficit so quickly that it will precipitate a recession. Says Mr. Darman: &quot;You don't want to have immediate contraction of the deficit; what you need is enactment of legislation that will reduce the deficit on an orderly basis over time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
