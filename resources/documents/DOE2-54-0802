The objectiveof the report is to compare the health effects resulting from the useof different drinking-water-treatment technologies with those preventedby biological treatment. The Subcommittee concludes that the constraintsof time and available budget, the report adequately surveys the availableinformation on health effects pf chemicals involved in water treatment,including cost estimates.
