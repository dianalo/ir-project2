The rating concern said the review will &quot;focus on the extent to which (BankAmerica's) return to core profitability can be sustained, and on its ability to restore its capital position in the context of its continuing high level of international and domestic problem loans.&quot;    The review will cover San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp.'s Ba-3-rated senior debt, including Eurobonds; its B-2 subordinated debt, and its preferred stock, currently rated B-3.    The bank holding company's BankAmerica Overseas Finance N.V. unit's Ba-3-rated guaranteed senior debt and its subordinated capital notes, now rated B-2, will be reviewed as well. The parent's flagship Bank of America unit will have its Baa-2 senior debt and long-term deposits reviewed; its Prime-2 rating for short-term deposits was confirmed.    Another bank unit, Seafirst Corp., will have its Ba-1 senior debt reviewed, as will Seafirst National Bank's Baa-1 long-term deposits.    A BankAmerica spokesman declined to comment on the pending review. </TEXT></DOC>
