Mayor</HEAD><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department reportedly isconducting preliminary criminal investigations of Mayor Tom Bradleyand Rep. Tony Coelho involving financial dealings with DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   Details of the investigations remained secret, but a keyquestion under scrutiny was whether Bradley and the House majoritywhip received illegally preferential treatment with the firm's``junk bond'' dealers, the Los Angeles Times report today.   The probe was likely to study whether investment opportunitiesmay have been offered to the two Democrats in exchange for possiblepolitical favors, the newspaper reported, citing unidentifiedsources.   The report of the preliminary investigation of Bradley follows afederal subpoena issued last week by the U.S. Attorney's office inNew York's Manhattan district seeking records of his transactionswith the beleaguered brokerage firm.   Such a preliminary investigation is the first official step inthe Justice Department's formal process for determining whetherevidence warrants a full-scale grand jury investigation leading topossible criminal prosecution.   The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter, thenewspaper said.   Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that the mayor was unawareof any such investigation.   Coehlo spokesman Fred Hatfield said the California congressmanis positive he is not the target of a Justice Departmentinvestigation.   Bradley and Coehlo have acknowledged they made investment dealsthrough Drexel Burnham.   The brokerage house came under scrutiny after allegations ofinsider trading and other securities violations were leveledagainst Los Angeles-based Michael Milken, who built its junk bonddivision and established the high-risk, high-yield bonds into apremiere tool to finance corporate takeovers.   The investigations were begun in Washington by the JusticeDepartment's Public Integrity Section after an apparentdisagreement between U.S. attorneys' offices in Los Angeles and NewYork over whether they were warranted, the Times said.   In Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner reportedly concludedthat the available facts did not call for further inquiries.   But sources told the newspaper Acting U.S. Attorney BenitoRomano of New York concluded that information gathered in hisoffice's long-running investigation of Drexel Burnham warrantedinquiries into dealings between the investment firm and Bradley andCoelho.   Since Romano's office lacked jurisdiction to pursue the probesbecause the transactions in question took place in Los Angeles, thePublic Integrity Section assumed responsibility for theinvestigations after concluding they were warranted, the Times said.   The section is a Justice Department unit responsible for lookinginto allegations of corruption against judges and other politicalfigures.   Bradley, who last month won an unprecedented fifth term asmayor, faces several investigations into allegations of financialmisdeeds and possible political favoritism.   Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House leadership, hasacknowledged that he failed to disclose a $50,000 loan from asavings and loan in California that he used toward purchase of$100,000 worth of junk bonds.</TEXT></DOC>
