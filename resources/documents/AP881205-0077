A second rebel garrison surrendered togovernment troops early today, the official news agency reported.   Four people were reported killed in the rebellion, the mostserious threat to President Raul Alfonsin's civilian governmentsince it replaced a disgraced military dictatorship five years ago.   The private news agency Noticias Argentinas said Gen. IsidroCaceres planned to go to the rebel garrison on the outskirts of thecapital to disarm troops loyal to Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.   Seineldin surrendered at the garrison in Villa Martelli onSunday, ending the military crisis.   It was not immediately known how many troops remained inside thegarrison.   The revolt began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coast guardunit rebelled. They joined an estimated 500 rebels, who took overpart of the suburban Campo de Mayo base Friday. The rebels moved toVilla Martelli a day later.   Troops at a second rebel garrison, the 6th mechanized infantryregiment in Mercedes, 60 miles east of the capital, laid down theirarms early today, the official news agency Telam said.   Telam said the commander of the Mercedes group, Maj. HugoReinaldo Abete, told his troops to lay down their arms followingSeineldin's surrender.   Despite the arrest of their leader, the rebels refused to concededefeat late Sunday.   ``We don't use the word `surrender;' we use the term`negotiation,''' one of Seineldin's followers, Maj. Luis AlbertoBrun, was quoted as saying in an interview with the independent newsagency Noticias Argentinas.   Brun said they were being allowed to return to their regiments.   President Raul Alfonsin said Sunday that no concessions were madeto obtain Seineldin's surrender.   ``This has been a really important success,'' he told reporters.``There were no concessions of any kind.''   It was the third such insurrection in 18 months.   More than 40 civilians and police were hospitalized with woundsfrom rubber and real bullets fired by rebels at Villa Martelli whenrock- and bottle-throwing demonstrators surged forward.   Rebels fired from inside the arsenal and from two cars that spedfrom the scene, the government news agency Telam reported.   Three civilians and a policeman were killed in Sunday's clash,Radio Rivadavia reported.   The army announced later that Seineldin had given himself up forarrest and that his followers agreed to put down their weapons andexplosives.   The rebels had demanded an end to the prosecution of officers forhuman rights abuses during the military dictatorships from 1976 to1983; amnesty for officers already convicted; and better militarypay and equipment.   One government military officer, Gen. Adolfo Patricio Etcheun,said he and his men agreed with Seineldin's demands that loyalisttroops not take up arms against the rebels.   The reason for the surrender was unclear.   Seineldin gave himself up after meeting with army chief Lt. Gen.Jose Dante Caridi, and the Noticias Argentinas and Diarios yNoticias news agencies said Caridi had agreed to a rebel demand thathe resign.   Alfonsin denied this.   On Friday, four soldiers and a 19-year-old woman walking near arebel stronghold were wounded in exchanges of gunfire between loyaltroops and rebels.   The rebels' demands spurred similar military uprisings in April1987 and January 1988.   Etcheun, commander of the 4th Infantry Paratroop Brigade inCordoba, said the demands ``are like mine and most of the army.''   Most Argentines were happy that what they perceived to be athreat to their 5-year-old democracy had been overcome.   ``Democracy Triumphed,'' said a message flashed across the screenby the five TV stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous newsof the revolt for nearly 24 hours.   Tens of thousands of people had gathered in plazas throughout thecountry to repudiate what they viewed as a threat to the 5-year-olddemocracy. The military, which took power in 1976, returned to thebarracks in 1983 after its defeat by Britain in the Falklands Warand an economic collapse.   Rebels demanded a stop to trials of military officers implicatedin a wave of officially sanctioned terror during military rule. Agovernment commission said nearly 9,000 Argentines were arrested bysecurity forces and presumed killed.   In December 1985, two former military presidents, Jorge Videlaand Roberto Viola, were convicted of human rights abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
