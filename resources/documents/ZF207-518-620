 Thecompany also needed to find a way to share network resourcescost-effectively, achieve both local and remote connectivity and eliminatenetwork downtime.andM;The solution hinged on a wide area network (WAN) based on two Infostream INX4400 Network Exchange units from Infotron Systems of Cherry Hill, N.J.,andO;linked to a fiber-optic T1 line and various Ethernet local area networks.andO;Developed over the last five years, the network serves more than 500 VAX, IBMand Macintosh users nationwide.andP;  The network exchanges let users consolidatevoice, data, video and facsimile into a single high-speed network.andM;First known for its expertise in optical sensors when it was founded in theearly 1970s, Nichols today concentrates its research and development onsoftware.andP;  Nichols scientists and engineers do most of their work ongovernment defense contracts, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative--theso-called &quot;Star Wars&quot; program--and missile systems.andM;Competition for government contracts is fierce, and the ability to meetcontractual deadlines is critical, noted Dwight Esslinger, computer hardwaremanager of Nichols' computer services group.andP;  &quot;To win contracts, we have toshow that we can produce.andP;  If we don't meet our deadlines, our chances ofgetting other contracts drop.&quot;andM;Esslinger's group installs and maintains Nichols' computer equipment inHuntsville and at 16 off-site locations--most near military bases--across thecountry.andM;Esslinger must ensure data connections not only among Nichols' employees andtheir various computers but also to computer resources at two governmentfacilities in Huntsville: the U.S.andP;  Army Strategic Defense Command SimulationCenter and the Advanced Research Center.andM;Keeping Pace with GrowthandM;Nichols' distributed data communications network has evolved over the lastseveral years to keep pace with the company's burgeoning annual employeegrowth rate of 45 percent, and its accompanying growth in computer equipment.andM;Today, the Nichols complex includes four buildings.andP;  Buildings 1 and 2 are onone side of a public road, and Buildings 3 and 4 are about 3,000 feet away onthe other side.andP;  Nichols' data center in Building 1 uses a VAX 8300, MicroVAX3500, VAX-11/750, MicroVAX II and three MicroVAX 2000s.andM;A 10Mbit-per-second Ethernet backbone network allows the VAX 8300, MicroVAX3500 and one of the MicroVAX 2000s to be clustered for use by Nichols'technical staff.andP;  The VAX-11/750 and the other two MicroVAX 2000s areclustered for accounting and contracts uses.andP;  The MicroVAX II is used forhighly classified, sensitive projects, and so, for security reasons, is notclustered, Esslinger said.andP;  An Apollo local area network, consisting of a DSP60 processor and three graphics workstations, also resides in the datacenter.andM;The Infostream INX 4400 data switches are located in Building 1 and Building3.andP;  They provide the essential data communications links between users' PCsand terminals and the data center's processors, as well as the governmentfacilities and Nichols' field offices, Esslinger explained.andM;Almost all Nichols scientists and engineers have a computer--an IBM PC or PCclone, Apple Macintosh or a C.Itoh VT100-compatible dumb terminal--on theirdesk, he said.andM;Virtually all on-site terminals and PCs are hard-wired to the INX 4400s;off-site facilities are accessed by modem over 9.6Kbit-per-second (9.6Kbps)links.andP;  The two INX 4400s are linked by a fiber-optic T1 line.andP;  The Ethernetbackbone also uses fiber-optic cable as its transmission medium.andM;The fiber-optic cable is fairly new, added just a year and a half ago.andM;&quot;Originally, the T1 line was hard-wired, but we have a big problem withlightning and thunderstorms in Huntsville, and once water got in the line, itwouldn't work.andP;  Those problems don't affect fiber,&quot; Esslinger explained.andO;Fiber also provides greater speed and bandwidth--&quot;128 channels on two littlefibers,&quot; he said.andM;Thanks to the Ethernet backbone, the INX 4400s and a FastPath gateway, theMac users--including office staff as well as scientists and engineers--arenow tied into the network.andM;In Nichols' four buildings are seven AppleTalk LANs, supporting Nichols' 150Macintoshes--a collection of Mac IIs, SEs and Pluses--and 15 LaserWriterprinters.andM;Previously, users on the AppleTalk LANs couldn't communicate outside of theirown LAN.andP;  Now, all LANs are connected to the Ethernet backbone, which in turnties them into the INX 4400s, giving them access to one another, other usersand network computing resources.andM;Achieving the sophisticated network that exists today hasn't been easy,developers said.andP;  The company's rapid growth in the last few yearsprecipitated a host of network changes.andM;Just six years ago, Nichols engineers had only 20 to 30 DEC VT100-compatibleterminals in two terminal centers available to them on a first-come,first-served basis to access Nichols' only CPU, a VAX-11/750.andM;The terminal centers quickly became overcrowded, delaying the engineers'work.andP;  As more engineers began to use PCs for software development,transferring their work to the VAX via asynchronous lines using file transfersoftware and protocols ate up even more valuable time.andM;Realizing that a cost-effective way to manage growth was essential, Nicholsconsidered several technologies: an Ethernet LAN, a data PBX and a dataswitch.andM;Switch Was Best ChoiceandM;Each offered similar connectivity advantages, but the switch costsignificantly less.andP;  Per-port costs for the LAN and PBX were about $800 and$500, respectively, whereas the switch cost about $250 per port and requiredless-expensive wiring.andP;  The choice was clear.andM;After evaluating several switches from different vendors, Nichols choseInfotron's 4002 switch, a predecessor to the 4400s installed today.andP;  Of theswitching products available, it alone provided the capacity, expandability,speed, diagnostics, configuration capability and upgrade path that Nicholsrequired, Esslinger said.andP;  The 4002, with 96 ports, was installed in 1984.andM;That solution worked fine--but not for long.andP;  When Esslinger joined thecompany almost three years ago, &quot;We had only the VAX 750, and were justgetting the 8300.andP;  Buildings 3 and 4 didn't exist.&quot;andM;But business boomed, and Nichols responded by adding 124 ports to itsnetwork--still not enough.andP;  &quot;We'd win a contract we didn't have any idea we'dget, and the next thing we'd know, we'd have 50 or 60 more engineers comingin,&quot; Esslinger recalled.andM;Nichols decided to add Building 3 and another 128 workstation locations withlinks not only to Buildings 1 and 2, but also to the government facilities inHuntsville.andP;  Thus, the company had to re-evaluate its networking options toachieve both local and remote connectivity.andM;An Ethernet LAN was again considered, and rejected because of its high cost.andO;This time, per-port costs were estimated at $500--still well above a switch'sper-port costs.andM;Nichols chose to upgrade to Infotron's new 4400 switch in late 1986.andP;  &quot;Wewere headed in that direction with the data switch.andP;  It had served our needswell,&quot; Esslinger said.andP;  He didn't even consider other vendors' products, hesaid.andM;The upgrade was cost-effective, company officials said.andP;  Old logic cards wereswapped for new ones, which upgraded the 4002 to a 4400 at a cost of $5,000.andO;Adding a second 4400 switch cost $30,000.andP;  Choosing the new switch alsooffered a bonus: Since the 4002 and 4400 operated similarly, no userretraining was needed, thus saving time and money, the officials said.andM;The benefits of the newer switch are many, Esslinger said.andP;  &quot;The diagnosticsare much better.andP;  The 4400 offers T1 capability and supports fiber optics.andO;Also, configuration is much easier.andP;  With the old switch, we could configureonly one port at a time.andP;  With the 4400, we can configure as many as we wantat once.&quot;andM;Information about the entire network configuration can also be stored on a 31/2-inch disk, another feature the 4002 lacked.andP;  &quot;When we configure thenetwork, we store that to disk.andP;  If we have a problem with the memory unit,we can reload it.andP;  With the old switch, we'd have to reconfigure fromscratch,&quot; Esslinger said.andM;Installing the new 4400 switch was a bit ticklish, because it was new notonly to Nichols but also to Infotron, which had just introduced the product.andM;&quot;There are always problems with installation, most of them due to our ownignorance with the new equipment,&quot; Esslinger explained.andM;&quot;Infotron installed the new 4400 as part of the purhase price.andP;  Because itwas new, their field people didn't have any experience with it, but we reallydidn't have any major problems.andP;  It took us a couple of days to get the newswitch up and running.andP;  Then we had to do the cabling and add ports, thenrewire all the buildings.&quot;andM;Shortly after upgrading to the 4400s, Nichols decided to take advantage ofits T1 capability to add 128 communications channels without adding any morededicated ports.andP;  The two switches were linked with a T1 line at a cost of$22,000 for two INX T1 drivers, one at each end.andM;As more employees began to use Apple Macintoshes and AppleTalk LANs, thenetwork was expanded again to include them.andM;Nichols added the Ethernet backbone to connect the Mac users and to clusterits DEC computers.andP;  The INX 4400s act as a front end for the hundreds ofterminals and PCs on the network, funneling them to three DEC terminalservers that interface them with the DEC processors.andM;The INX 4400s' rotary capability, which allows users to search for ports notin use, regulates port usage and saves money on the number of ports needed,he said.andM;&quot;We couldn't operate without the INX's rotary capability,&quot; Esslinger said.andO;&quot;The terminal servers don't have that.&quot;andP;  The INX 4400s also allow users toshare peripherals, including plotters and printers.andM;Esslinger considers Nichols' current network to be state of the art--anecessity to maintain Nichols' competitive edge among its peers.andM;&quot;We're running the latest, most up-to-date equipment we van,&quot; Esslinger said.andO;&quot;Fiber optics, for instance, is wonderful stuff.andP;  When we had hard wirebetween buildings, a thunderstorm would radiate thousands of volts, run downthe wires and knock out equipment on both ends.&quot;andM;Infotron's service and support throughout all these changes earn top marks,he said.andM;&quot;We've had good luck with Infotron in troubleshooting problems,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;We can call up, and they'll help us isolate the problem over the phone.andP;  Ourphone calls are returned in an hour.andP;  I haven't seen anything to beat it.&quot;andM;Nichols pays about $8,000 a year, which is figured on a percentage of the$200,000 of Infotron equipment it owns, to participate in a &quot;parts bank.&quot;andM;&quot;I can order a channel, memory, T1 or any other board I need right now, andthey'll have it here the next day,&quot; Esslinger said.andP;  Because these boards cancost between $3,000 and $5,000 apiece, he added, he easily gets his money'sworth.andM;Overall, Esslinger said he is satisfied with Nichols' networking solution.andO;&quot;The INX is very reliable.andP;  It's made really well.andP;  And it's easilyexpandable.&quot;andM;Expandability is important because Esslinger doesn't expect Nichols' rapidgrowth to slow down anytime soon.andP;  His network plans reflect thatexpectation.andM;&quot;Now, we have two 9.6Kbps loops going to the Advanced Research Center with 24channels on two statistical multiplexers.andP;  That's old technology,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Within the next three months, we'll replace the stat muxes with a bridge tothe Ethernet network and a 56Kbps line.andP;  This will increase the number ofchannels by two to three times.&quot;andM;Esslinger is also considering beefing up network management.andM;&quot;We don't have a network management system.andP;  We're looking at Infotron'sAdvanced Network Manager,&quot; he said.andP;  He estimated that the addition wouldprobably cost between $10,000 and $15,000.andM;Managing spurts of network growth cost-effectively, and staying competitiveat the same time, is a challenge but it can be done, Esslinger said.andM;&quot;Find a vendor with equipment that is easily expandable,&quot; he advised.andO;&quot;That's the biggest thing.andP;  Whatever expansion you see in your wildestimagination, try to plan for it.andP;  Also look at the possibilities fointerfacing fiber to any equipment you pick.andP;  We've had no problem with theINX system.andP;  It worked the first time we plugged it in, and it's been workingever since.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
