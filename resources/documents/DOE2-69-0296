We assume a small state and a dominantstate with representative profit maximizing producers who extract andexplore a non-renewable resource. The incidence of the tax is studiedby analyzing deadweight losses and tax revenues from consumers and producers.The extent of tax shifting is determined by calculating the percentageof consumers and producers that must be out-of-state for the tax to bewelfare neutral. 10 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
