They are among eight aging, longtime prisoners de Klerk saidwould be released to ``contribute to the spirit of reconciliationwhich is presently evident in our country.''   He said Mandela, regarded by many black South Africans as theirleader, was told of the proposed releases in advance.   Murphy Morobe, spokesman for the banned United Democratic Frontanti-apartheid alliance, was with Mandela at his home on the VictorVerster prison farm north of Cape Town when the releases wereannounced on state television.   ``Mr. Mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonightafter all his efforts to secure their release,'' Morobe said, andquoted Mandela as saying to South Africans: ``The people are goingto be greatly endowed by the leadership who are coming out ofjail.''   Morobe and a few other black anti-apartheid leaders were at theMandela house, including Albertina Sisulu, wife of Mandela's closefriend and ANC colleague, the 77-year-old Sisulu, a leadingpolitical strategist of the banned ANC.   Cassim Saloojee, a member of the group, read a statement fromMandela, 71, saying ``My release is not an issue at this stage.''Saloojee added: ``His deepest concern is that all the othercomrades be released.''   In Blackpool, England, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomedthe announcement of the releases, calling it ``a major step in theright direction.''   The releases had been expected as ammunition for Mrs. Thatcherto use at the forthcoming Commonwealth summit against imposingfurther economic sanctions on South Africa. The summit, inMalaysia, begins Oct. 18.   De Klerk acknowledged the decision was ``taken against thebackground of requests and representations from various sourcesover a long period.'' He said the views of moderate blacks,including leaders of tribal homelands whom the African NationalCongress rejects, had ``carried special weight.''   On Wednesday, De Klerk is to meet in Pretoria with three of themost prominent black South African clergymen: Anglican ArchbishopDesmond Tutu; the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the WorldAlliance of Reformed Churches; and the Rev. Frank Chikane, generalsecretary of the South African Council of Churches.   They have said they want to establish before the Commonwealthconference whether de Klerk ``is serious about dismantlingapartheid and entering negotiations to bring about a trulydemocratic South Africa.''   After the release announcement was broadcast, Chikane said:``This was one item. The greater part of the agenda has to do withcreating a climate conducive to negotiation.   ``If we do not get a clear indication of what Mr. de Klerk isgoing to do, and his aim is just to release leaders to come andlive in an apartheid society, then we will continue calling forsanctions in this country.''   Chikane said he understood Mandela's position ``that his releaseis not the critical thing. His release without a package to end theapartheid system would be meaningless. I understand him to besaying his release cannot be a substitute for the freedom of thepeople.''   De Klerk said the men would be freed ``as soon as the necessaryformalities can be dealt with, which can take some time.'' A prisonofficial said privately the process can take from an hour to twoweeks.   According to the president, ``all relevant factors were broughtinto consideration, including the fact that most of these prisonershad already served many, many years of their sentences and arealready advanced in years. ... A favorable climate currently existsin which the release can take place.''   The most prominent prisoner on the list is Sisulu, who randay-to-day operations of the ANC as its secretary-general in1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign.   He was sentenced to life in June 1964, along with Mandela andother leaders of the ANC's internal military wing, for sabotage andplotting the overthrow of the white goverment. Mandela already hadspent two years in prison.   Mandela's other co-defendants to be freed are Ahmed Kathrada,60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba,69.   Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who briefly took command of the ANC militarywing, Spear of the Nation, after Mandela's co-defendants werearrested in July 1963, is to be released from a life term hereceived after a separate trial in 1964.   De Klerk's announcement also named Oscar Mpetha, an 80-year-old,partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of hisfive-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release nextyear.   Mpetha, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the ANCleader in Cape province and, during the appeal of his terrorismsentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the UnitedDemocratic Front.   The judge said he did not want to send Mpetha to prison but thatthe Terrorism Act, since repealed, required it.   No information was immediately available on the eighth man,Jafta Masemula.   Two other co-defendants of Mandela, Dennis Goldberg and GovanMbeki, were freed previously.   Goldberg, the only white convicted in the trial, was deported in1985.   Mbeki was released two years ago in what the government said wasa test case for the possible release of Mandela. He was banned fromspeaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown,even though the government said his release was unconditional.</TEXT></DOC>
