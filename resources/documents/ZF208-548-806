 Much of the space is set aside to let air circulate.andO;Without plenty of breathing room, the mainframe overheats itself andeverything around it.andM;The site features DEC VAXs, special-purpose computers for graphics andsimulation, two Scientific Computer Systems SCS40 mini-supercomputers, andhundreds of PCs and workstations.andP;  The Philadelphia plant constitutes the hubof a fiber-optic network that stretches south to Wilmington, Del., over aDS-3 microwave system and branches out to Seattle, Wash., and Vienna, Ga.,andO;via leased lines.andP;  BCS, which also services customers such as the FederalGovernment, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the City of New York, wouldseem to have its hands full just maintaining the mammoth installation, butthat's not the case.andM;About 16 months ago, driven by requests from the engineering staff, BCSdecided to acquire Macintoshes, plan a LAN linking the machines, and makethem friendly to--or at least compatible with--the variety of systems in theplant.andP;  In the words of one of its technical specialists, Philip Goldblum,&quot;The objective is to be able to access any of the systems and perform yourwork on it, regardless of the type of device that happens to be on your desk.andO;It could be a standard VT-220 type terminal, an Apollo workstation, a Compaq386, or a Macintosh.&quot;andM;Most users are Boeing Helicopter engineers, graphic artists, and secretaries,who have varying computer experience.andP;  BCS managers and support staff have anumber of Macintoshes.andP;  Macintoshes are used by Boeing Helicopter managersand its audio-visual department for preparing proposals and presentationmaterials used by Boeing Helicopter's top executives.andP;  The marketingdepartment will be receiving Macintoshes in the near future.andM;Although 450-500 BCS employees are on-site, only about 10 are involveddirectly in Macintosh support.andP;  Of those 10, three technical specialists helpend users and people from BCS's networking group and facilities department,who handle purchasing, installation, and machined servicing machines.andM;Boeing's ApplesandM;According to Goldblum, the acquisition of machines starts with a technicalspecialist working with end users to find out what they need and where themachines will be located.andP;  The specialist coordinates the requests with thegroups handling the purchase of the machine, installation, and wiring.andO;Boeing is an Apple National Account and usually makes bulk purchases directlyfrom Apple.andP;  Loretta Santisi, a technician in BCS's networking departmentnotes that the company generally buys an entire system, including hard disk,from Apple to reduce installation time and take advantage of corporatediscounts.andM;Boeing Helicopter has between 120 and 150 Macintosh systems, all of which areconnected to the LAN.andP;  Of those machines, 99 are located at the main plant.andO;Six months ago, most of the machines were monochrome, small-footprintMacintosh SEs outfitted with video cards and large displays.andP;  But with therecent purchase of 50 Macintosh IIx and IIcx machines, 68030-based units withbetween five and eight MB of RAM, 80M-byte or larger hard disks and colordisplays are predominant.andM;BCS has shied away from the Macintosh SE/30.andP;  &quot;Although it's a good fastmachine,&quot; says Goldblum, &quot;it has only one internal slot.andP;  Most of our userswho end up with a Macintosh SE or SE/30 require a larger display, so theregoes the slot.andP;  If we buy them a IIcx, we have a few slots left over.andP;  Itmakes the machine a little bit easier for our service people to work on.andO;It's physically easier for them to take apart and to modify.&quot;andM;BCS' most recent order was entirely IIcxs and all future purchases will beIIcxs or IIcis, when they are available.andP;  The IIci, introduced by Applerecently, boosts the processor speed up to 25 MHz.andP;  It features a specialdirect processor slot for add-in options that access the processor directlyand a color video card built into the system board.andM;Since most of Boeing's Macintoshes are configured with the Apple colordisplay, the advent of the IIci will cut installation time by eliminating theneed for an additional video card.andP;  Also, the direct processor slot allowsfor further acceleration of the processor and the installation of graphicsaccelerators and math coprocessors that need direct access to the data andaddress bus.andP;  Since some Macintoshes at Boeing have displays with aresolution of greater than 1,000 by 1,000 pixels, BCS is monitoring thedevelopment of the QuickDraw accelerator cards by Apple and SuperMac forinstallation in the IIci's new slot.andM;Between 10 and 15 of the installed machines have two-page, gray scaledisplays.andP;  But since Apple's new two-page display is considerably lessexpensive than other products, they will probably be more common in thefuture.andP;  Although they are used primarily for graphics work, many engineersusing Microsoft Excel for spreadsheets like the big monitor's ability todisplay 60 horizontal rows and 25 vertical columns using the standard font.andM;BCS chose LattisNet from SynOptics Communications (Mountain View, Calif.),andO;which allows for a fiber-optic Ethernet backbone with coax or unshieldedtwisted-pair subnetworks.andP;  Unlike many implementations of unshieldedtwisted-pair, LattisNet uses a chip-level transceiver integrated onto theinterface card.andP;  LattisNet networks use a star topology.andP;  At Boeing, a Model100 central concentrator serves as a hub leading out to several Model 10 10remote concentrators, each of which can handle 24 nodes, which may be PCs orMacintoshes.andP;  Although other types of wiring are present in isolated spots,BCS is making the transition so that all Ethernet nodes will be connectedusing LattisNet.andM;The decision to use LattisNet reflects practical considerations.andP;  First,since the plant buildings are already full of unused telephone wire,LattisNet dramatically reduces the cost-per-node of implementing Ethernet.andO;Second, the crowded, open-landscape design of the engineering departmentmeans that a Macintosh often is positioned so that the back of the machinefaces the aisle where people walk.andP;  Goldblum describes that in the past whenthick Ethernet was installed, &quot;Big cable stuck straight out six to eightinches from the back of the machine.andP;  Eventually it would get stuck aroundsomebody's foot and they'd rip it out of the back of the machine, damagingthe board.andP;  LattisNet makes for a very neat, easy-to-live with connection.andO;There's no big coax or heavy cable.&quot;andM;The connections between the Macintoshes and the twisted-pair LattisNet vary.andO;Macintosh SEs are connected with external twisted-pair transceivers calledEtherSC from Kinetics (Walnut Creek, Calif.), now a part of Novell.andP;  EtherSCis an external box about the size of a videocassette but thinner, which letsa Macintosh access Ethernet through its SCSI port.andP;  The Macintosh SEs use theexternal transceivers, which are more expensive and less elegant thaninternal transceivers, because there is no room for an internal card.andP;  Atthis point, it's mostly the secretaries who have Macintosh SEs and theexpansion slot is occupied by a full-page display.andM;Macintosh II series machines are connected to the Ethernet with Kinetics'EtherPort IIL.andP;  The EtherPort IIL is an internal card for the Macintosh II'sNuBus backplane, developed jointly by Kinetics and SynOptics Communications.andO;The card integrates SynOptics' LattisNet transceiver for unshieldedtwisted-pair onto Kinetics' Ethernet interface cards for the Macintosh II.andO;With the IIL (or its miniaturized brother, the NL) installed, a Macintosh IIconnects directly to LattisNet through a standard RJ-45 connector.andM;In addition to the Ethernet LAN running on a fiber-optic backbone, Boeing hasa PhoneNet LAN, a Farallon Computing's (Berkeley, Calif.) version ofLocalTalk.andP;  PhoneNet connects LaserWriter printers, Macintoshes hooked uptemporarily, and devices, such as Shiva's (Cambridge, Mass.) NetModems, thatcannot be connected physically to Ethernet.andP;  Kinetics' FastPaths connect thePhoneNet LAN to the Ethernet LAN, so that each LAN user can access otherresources.andM;The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is finalizing astandard called 10BaseT for Ethernet on unshielded twisted-pair.andP;  In theory,all cards built to the standard's specifications will be compatible with eachother, allowing board swapping and even individual chips and transceiversfrom one machine to another.andP;  Farallon announced that PhoneNet will supportthe standard, and Asante Technologies (Sunnyvale, Calif.) indicated that itsEthernet card for the Macintosh SE will provide a 10BaseT connector.andP;  Withthe exception of the Kinetics L series used at Boeing, most MacintoshEthernet cards on the market provide only coaxial connections.andM;Because Boeing is heavily involved with OSI, it naturally has an eye towardOSI.andP;  According to Santisi, Boeing's concern with OSI compatibility is partlybehind the decision to go with Ethernet instead of AppleTalk.andP;  She notes,&quot;From a wiring standpoint, AppleTalk is great--it's one-pair wire,&quot; but sheadds that speed considerations and OSI compatibility convinced Boeing toimplement Ethernet for the Macintoshes and leave the LaserWriters onAppleTalk.andM;Although Boeing Helicopter has a large Ethernet investment, Ethernet may notremain the company's LAN choice.andP;  Santisi says that Boeing is concerned withusing products that are industry standards, and in this spirit, thenetworking group is evaluating whether Token Ring will be that standard.andO;Thus, Boeing waiting to put most of Boeing's DOS-compatible machines on aLAN.andP;  It also is leaving open the possible migration of the AppleTalk LAN toToken Ring until a 16-bit card is approved and tested fully.andM;BCS has installed different LAN operating systems on different machines basedon user needs.andP;  The appleTalk Command Suite is available on all Macintoshcomputers and every machine has two terminal emulation packages:VersaTerm-Pro from Synergy Software (Reading, Penn.) and the Alisa Systems'(Pasadena, Calif.) terminal driver using part of DEC's CTERM remote terminalprotocol.andP;  BCS uses Alisa's AlisaShare so AppleShare users can use a VAX asfile server.andM;Because the engineering staff at Boeing works quite a bit on the VAX, many ofthe Macintoshes are DECnet nodes.andP;  DECnet compatibility is due to Alisa'sTSSnet, which makes a Macintosh a Phase IV end node on a DECnet network.andO;TSSnet provides the full complement of DECnet services, including VMS Mail,Network File Transfer, and background File Access Listener.andP;  TSSnet is theonly package available that makes a Macintosh a full member on a DECnetnetwork.andM;Some users require TCP/IP compatibility, primarily for file transfers to andfrom UNIX hosts.andP;  For these users, BCS installed the NCSA Telnet program,which is used for Telnet terminal service and FTP file transfer.andP;  WhenMacintosh users need to go Macintosh-to-Macintosh or Macintosh-to-PC, theyuse TOPS from TOPS/Sun Microsystems (Alameda, Calif.).andM;&quot;The various protocols,&quot; says Goldblum, &quot;are scattered about where we needthem, since they get rather expensive on a node-by-node basis.&quot;andP;  He alsonotes that &quot;they work simultaneously.andP;  You can actually run all of thesethings on one Macintosh at the same time.&quot;andM;Five AlisaShare servers run on five VAXs at Boeing Helicopter.andP;  One is usedby the general engineering community, with another set up for a subgroup ofthe engineering department.andP;  A third is run by the office systems divisionand is available for general use.andP;  The fourth is located in the flight TestCenter, which is 25 miles away and connected to the plant's network via aDS-3 microwave system.andP;  The fifth is dedicated to internal BCS groups.andO;Macintosh users and the rest of the engineering group primarily use the VAXsto run FORTRAN programs for engineering analysis tasks such as circuit designand structural analysis.andP;  Two VAXs are gateways to an SNA host.andM;BCS plans to install two GatorBoxes soon.andP;  Cayman Systems' (Cambridge, Mass.)andO;GatorBoxes provides a LocalTalk-to-Ethernet gateway to Suns, VAXs, Apollos,and other Network File system (NFS) servers compatible with the AppleShareuser interface.andP;  The GatorBox's main competitor is Kinetics' FastPath, whichis a TCP/IP router rather than an NFS gateway.andP;  At Boeing, the GatorBoxeswill connect Macintosh users to the pair of SCS40 mini-supercomputers runningNFS.andP;  The connection will enable the engineering staff to access files storedon the SCS40s as though they were accessing an AppleShare file server.andM;ApplicationsandM;As a general rule, Boeing's users have individual copies of applicationssoftware packages on their hard disks.andP;  Software varies among users (forexample, some large-display Macintoshes include scanners and OmniPagesoftware for optical character recognition and general scanning work), butthere are constants.andM;Microsoft Excel and Word predominate with VersaTerm-Pro and HyperCard on 95percent of Macintoshes.andP;  MacDraw II and MacPaint are common among graphicsusers.andP;  MacProject, a project scheduling package, is installed on 40-50percent of the machines.andP;  WordPerfect, PageMaker Cricket Graph, and CricketDraw are found on 10-15 percent of Boeing's Macintosh systems.andM;Few nodes have database managers such as Fox Software's (Perrysburg, Ohio)FoxBase or Ashton-Tate's (Torrance, Calif.) dBASE Macintosh, since most datathe engineering personnel need to access is stored on the IBM mainframe inDB2, which they access through terminal emulation.andP;  Goldblum says that BCShas no definitive plans to provide Macintosh users with a Structured QueryLanguage-based front end, such as Oracle's (Belmont, Calif.) Oracle forMacintosh for transparent access to the databases.andM;BCS implemented LAN-specific software in two areas: electronic mail and LANmanagement.andP;  E-mail was installed at Boeing long before the Macintoshesappeared.andP;  Boeing's corporate entities are connected by IBM mainframesrunning the PROFS office system.andP;  Most Boeing Helicopter employees, however,communicate with VMS Mail on the VAX or UNIX Mail.andP;  Hence BCS is installingAlisa Systems' AlisaMail onto the AlisaShare servers on the VAX.andM;With AlisaMail installed, Macintosh users with Microsoft Mail can send andreceive messages using all the mail systems.andP;  The users are fully integratedinto the existing E-mail environment, able to send mail where they like.andP;  BCSchose Microsoft Mail over the other E-mail packages because of thepredominance of Excel and Word at Boeing Helicopter, the most recent versionsof which allow users to open and send mail from Microsoft Mail withoutexiting the application.andM;A store-and-forward E-mail system, AlisaMail stores messages then attempts toroute them to their intended recipients at regular intervals.andP;  A number ofmail systems tested by BCS had the drawback that they were notstore-and-forward, so if a user sent a message to someone whose machine wasoff, the user got a message that the person was unavailable and to try againlater.andP;  According to Santisi, a flaw with the AlisaMall system is that itslows down the response time on the VAX when many people may be trying toaccess it.andM;To monitor and control the AppleTalk LAN, BCS has experimented with justabout every AppleTalk network management package including Farallon'sTrafficWatch, CheckNet and Timbuktu, Kinetics' LAN Ranger, and Apple'sInter*Poll.andP;  TrafficWatch, LAN Ranger, and Inter*Poll allow the networkmanager to watch the packets on the LAN rather than engage in proactivemanagement.andM;The versions of TrafficWatch and CheckNet that BCS tested only allowed usertraffic to be monitored in one zone at a time.andP;  With 11-15 zones operating onthe LAN depending on whether all the servers are up, a LAN manager loggedonto network B could not monitor traffic on network C without logging off B.andO;LAN Ranger lets the LAN manager go to any subnetwork.andP;  Goldblum says of LANRanger, &quot;For a version one program of that complexity, it works respectablywell.&quot;andM;Backup and Support Farallon's Timbuktu, a remote control program forAppleTalk, is installed on most nodes and used for remote technical support.andO;Timbuktu allows one Macintosh user to control another Macintosh across atelephone line or AppleTalk network.andM;With 40-50 users per technical specialist, Timbuktu saves support personneltime and shoe leather.andP;  In its initial stages, a LAN management project atBoeing is focusing on centralization of the backup procedures for theMacintoshes with hard disks.andP;  At present, users are handed a copy of HDBackup, Apple's mediocre disk backup utility.andP;  Santisi noted that Boeing'spractice has been for users to do their own backups.andM;Recently, however, BCS tested NetStream, a utility allowing a LaN operator toback up files of any LaN hard disk onto any device such as tape drive orremovable hard disk.andP;  NetStream's notable feature is an automated back-upfacility so users can regularly save information about the files or foldersthey want to back up in a configuration file.andP;  During the second or thirdshift (as long as the machine is left on), NetStream initiates a back up ofuser files based on the user's configuration file.andM;Reaching GoalsandM;With so many competing interests and technologies, BCS wants to reachintegration and uniformity based on industry standards.andP;  The presence of somany products enables it to pick the right tool for each users needs and asGoldblum says, &quot;If they made only two of a product, we probably have one.&quot;andO;Thus, with a strong commitment to IBM and DEC mainframes and a belief thatOSI-compatible network may be the future standard, BCS and Boeing Helicopteris moving forward on several fronts.andM;Christoper Dwyer is a consultant based in Philadelphia, Penn.andP;  He contributesfrequently to LAN Magazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
