<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0632 </DOCNO><TEXT>Equipment is under development for optical inspection of CAGR fuel elementsunder water in power station cooling ponds. Such inspection is regardedas an effective adjunct to normal in-cave PIE and is supported by variousexperimental trials, the main results of which are described. The systemis based on a special borescope coupled to a t.v. camera and it is anticipatedthat surface condition can be monitored with a resolution of about 20microns, to a depth of 250mm below the top brace. Furthermore, a limitedamount of mensuration is planned. Consideration is also given to implementationof the equipment at a power station.</TEXT></DOC>
