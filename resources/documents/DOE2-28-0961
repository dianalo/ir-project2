<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0961 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the defense authorization act, Congress has limited testing of theStrategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to those tests described by the DefenseDepartment as within the bounds of the traditional interpretation ofthe treaty through fiscal year 1988. For the moment, the administrationcannot move to implement its broad interpretation of the ABM Treaty,which would allow unlimited testing of exotic-technology Star Wars systems.Unfortunately, this victory over the broad interpretation is threatenedby the administration's twisting of the traditional view. By stretchingambiguities in the treaty's language, the Defense Department is attemptingto justify tests that press far into grey areas. A strong case can bemade that some of the tests currently planned are likely to violate areasonable reading of the traditional interpretation of the treaty. Otherplanned tests, while complying with the letter of the treaty, are clearefforts to circumvent the agreement's intent, undermining the effectivenessof the treaty regime. If the US justifies such tests by making unverifiabledistinctions and exploiting loopholes, we will have no grounds for complaintwhen the USSR does the same, and we will ultimately lose the securitybenefits provided by the ABM Treaty. To clarify the compliance issuesraised by SDI's current plans, this analysis describes the major pastand planned SDI tests that may affect the ABM Treaty Regime.</TEXT></DOC>
