In site selection, the concernis with the compositions of lunar regoliths, in particular with theirtitanium contents. It is widely accepted that compositions of mare regolithsare controlled by the nature of the underlying basalts from which theregoliths are largely derived. The distribution and extent of the threegroups of basalts and the regoliths derived from them are the first basisfor site selection and evaluation. Other considerations are briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
