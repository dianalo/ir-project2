As of late yesterday, the Norwegian-flagged tanker MegaBorg was lying about 57 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas,oozing some of the 38 million gallons of crude in the ship'shold. The ship caught fire early Saturday morning and laterexplosions turned surrounding oil-coated seas into aninferno. Two seamen were killed and two others remainmissing. Fears that the ship might sink raised the specter ofa possible oil spill three times as large as that of theExxon Valdez last year off Alaska.</LP><TEXT>   So far, costs of fighting the fire and containing the oilwere being born by the ship's owner, according to U.S.authorities. The oil company that produced the crude,France's Elf Aquitaine Inc., and the Texas facilities wherethe oil was headed disavowed responsibility.   &quot;Elf was not the shipper and we don't believe we'reliable,&quot; said a spokesman, who flew to Houston from Paris onSunday. But he promised, &quot;We're certainly going to doanything in conjunction with the Coast Guard and the shipowner to contain any potential threat to the environment.&quot;   Though no one has suggested that in this case the shippingcompany will attempt to avoid liability, the incident renewsconcerns over who would -- and more important, could -- payto clean up a giant spill off the U.S. Right now, legalexperts say, liability for any spill and cleanup belongs totanker operators.   But unless the tanker is owned and operated by a big oilcompany, as the Exxon Valdez is, there's some question aboutwhether any shipper's pockets would be deep enough to cover adisaster on that scale. Exxon Corp. so far has shoulderedmore than $2 billion in costs in the Alaskan cleanup nowentering its second summer.   Ironically, yesterday one of the world's largest oilcompanies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group took a step directly aimedat reducing its liabilities as a tanker operator by curbingthe number of its own ships being sent to the U.S. Thecompany will hire independent ships instead, which meanstheir owners, not Shell, would face potential spillliability.   The Anglo-Dutch oil company decided its ships no longerwill carry about 40,000 of the 180,000 oil barrels they nowhaul daily into dozens of U.S. ports, idling as many as fourof the company's 46 owned or managed tankers world-wide.   Although relatively minor in terms of Shell's overallshipping, the move could encourage others to follow suit. Ifthe practice spreads, higher U.S. gasoline prices andincreased risks of oil spills as smaller and less-qualifiedoperators handle more oil imports could result, some analystspredicted. The impact &quot;could be a half cent a gallon as anextra environmental price&quot; for gasoline, said Jeremy Elden,an oil analyst at U.K. brokers UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew.   &quot;We have looked again at our {U.S.} shipping operations inthe light of the fallout from the Valdez situation,&quot; said IanMcGrath, managing director of Shell International Marine Ltd.in London. &quot;We face largely unlimited and uninsurable damageclaims&quot; from spills in the U.S., exposure that doesn't existin most other nations, he added.   Shell's groupwide coverage totals about $1 billion. Thecompany hasn't &quot;been involved in any spills which we wouldcall major&quot; in the past decade, Mr. McGrath stressed. Butopen-ended U.S. claims for billions of dollars are &quot;the sortof risk I'm not prepared to take anymore.&quot;   Other shippers may well follow Shell's lead. &quot;When Shellmakes a decision, all the responsible {tanker} ownersseriously consider the matter,&quot; said Kristian Fugelsang,shipping policy manager of the International Association ofIndependent Tanker Owners, an Oslo group that represents morethan half of the world's tanker tonnage. The number ofindependent operators likely to copy Shell's move &quot;depends onhow they view the prospects for getting insurance,&quot; Mr.Fugelsang said.   In the Gulf of Mexico accident, parties quickly tried todistance themselves. &quot;We were buying oil delivered,&quot; saidJames Smith, president of Crown Central Petroleum Corp. inBaltimore, which was awaiting delivery of the Angolan crudeto its Pasadena, Texas, refinery. &quot;Title and risk pass onlywhen the crude passes our reception point. It belongs toElf,&quot; he said.   Mr. Smith conceded that the potential for liability if theMega Borg were to unleash its full cargo is huge. &quot;It sure isscary,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a consideration every time that youget something like this.&quot;   The tanker's destination was actually a terminal operatedby Atlantic Richfield Co. in Texas City, Texas, which thenwas to transport oil to Crown by pipeline. &quot;We don't haveanything to do with this,&quot; said an Arco spokesman in LongBeach, Calif. &quot;Arco operates the terminal but it was not ouroil.&quot;   Attempts to ascertain the owner of the Mega Borgillustrate the complexity of the international shippingindustry. The Coast Guard said the U.S. agent for the MegaBorg is Biehl andamp; Co. in Galveston. A person answering thephone for Biehl who declined to give his name said, &quot;We haveno comments at this office.&quot; He said the ship's owner wasK.S. Mega Borg II of Norway. Efforts to reach the companythere were unsuccessful late yesterday.   But according to some Norwegian news accounts, the ownerof the tanker is called Hafslund Nycomed A/S. By otheraccounts, the ship is just under 50%-owned by a companycalled Mosvolds Rederi AS of Norway with the rest held byprivate shipowners, and the ship is operated by a separateconcern.   Concerns about liability raised by the Mega Borg accidentwere already growing after a tanker spill just last week inNew York Harbor and another earlier this year near HuntingtonBeach, Calif.   In last week's spill, the buyer of the oil said it wasn'tresponsible because the oil never got to its dock. &quot;It's notours until it's delivered,&quot; said a spokesman forHouston-based Coastal Corp. &quot;It wasn't delivered.&quot; The tankerowner has been paying for and coordinating the New YorkHarbor cleanup.   But in the California spill, the buyer of the oil, BritishPetroleum Co., took a different tack. Though the companymaintains it didn't have to, BP nonetheless coordinated a $30million cleanup. &quot;The primary responsibility is on the vesselowner in the event of a spill,&quot; said John Morgan, a BP seniorvice president, crude trading and transportation. And BP saidthe cost will be passed on to the shipping concern.   But BP had a clause in its contract with the vessel thatallowed it to step in. &quot;We recognize that many tanker ownershave most of their assets on the water and don't have awealth of personnel shoreside who could be quickly mobilizedto clean up a spill like that,&quot; said Chuck Webster, BP'scrisis manager who oversaw its mobilization. By quicklytaking charge, BP may also have headed off some of the kindof criticism that Exxon faced.   Actually -- though Exxon might not agree -- industryofficials now say that Alaska was fortunate that the shipoperator there was a wealthy oil company like Exxon insteadof a company that operates only tankers. &quot;It's an absolutecertain fact that we're lucky it was Exxon,&quot; said Bob Skall,a U.S. Coast Guard assistant chief in the environmentalresponse division in Washington.   The recent series of events may renew pressure on Congressto send President Bush an oil-spill prevention and liabilitybill that has been stalled on Capitol Hill for six months.The House and Senate passed similar versions of thelegislation last year in the wake of the Exxon Valdez spillbut have been unable to work out deep differences overwhether to require double hulls on tankers.   Among other provisions, the legislation would raiseminimum and also set maximum liability limits for tankers,barges and oil facilities, although states could stillenforce their own stricter liability laws. Federalcompensation and cleanup costs beyond the proposed liabilitylimits would be paid out of a new $1 billion fund financed bya five-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic and imported oil.   The oil industry and its shippers have been arguing forlimits. Without ceilings, &quot;you would end up with only theunscrupulous owners&quot; or single-ship companies &quot;prepared totake the chance of going&quot; to the U.S., maintained Mr.Fugelsang of the international tanker owners' group.   &quot;That's a distinct possibility,&quot; said Kenneth Norris, anattorney for Boyar, Norton andamp; Blair in Houston who is alsocommander of the Coast Guard Reserves in Galveston. &quot;A lot ofthe shipping companies are shells, so you can't get to theparents' assets.&quot;   ---   Barbara Rosewicz contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
