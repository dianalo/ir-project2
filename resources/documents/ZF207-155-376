 The main users will be corporations trying to rationalize much oftheir existing wide-area telecommunications facilities.andP;  With ISDN,corporations can make a general, integrated voice and data network availableto all users.andM;It would be wrong to assume that ISDN can fulfill all of a corporation'scommunications requirements.andP;  The highest-capacity ISDN channel, the PrimaryRate Access, operates at either 1.544M bps or 2.084M bps, significantlyslower than LANs currently in operation.andP;  Also, Primary Rate Access is notgenerally available for communication between individual users.andP;  Somepotential drawbacks of ISDN are dealt with later in this column.andM;ISDN BenefitsandM;There are many areas, however, where ISDN services can bring major benefits.andO;The progressive deployment of ISDN across Europe, North America and Asia willencourage the expansion of wide-area, integrated voice and datacommunications.andP;  By providing two 64K-bps (144K) clear information channelsand a separate 16K-bps channel for signaling, ISDN makes a wide range offeatures and services available to the whole community of telephone users.andM;A major advantage of ISDN to the subscriber, the ability to integrate voiceand data over the two 64K-bps channels, is that while a user accesses one ofthe 64K-bps channels for a telephone conversation, the other 64K-bps channelcan be used to either send or receive data.andP;  With common-channel signaling,telephone users will have displayed on their handsets the names or numbers ofincoming calls.andM;If the line is busy, the called party's telephone will display the nameand/or number of the person trying to call, providing the option of takingthe incoming call or maintaining the existing one.andM;The caller will also be able to send a short text message to be displayed onthe receiving telephone, an advantage if you're on the telephone and someoneelse is trying to call you.andP;  If you're out and someone wants to leave you atext message, this would be filed in an electronic mailbox that can beaccessed when you get back.andP;  If the caller would rather leave a spokenmessage, the ISDN central switching office can store incoming voice messagesin digital form and play them back when requested.andM;One advantage of both digital networks and ISDN is that they allow thefunctions of the telephone and the PC to be integrated.andM;The illustration shows an example of an ISDN integrated workstation.andP;  The PCcan contain a database of telephone numbers that can be dialed from thecomputer's keyboard.andP;  The telephone electronics can be built into thecomputer so that all the user needs is a simple handset attached to the PC'skeyboard.andP;  A speaker built into the computer can provide speech functions andhands-free dialing.andM;For the first time, mixed voice, text or data communications can be handledby a single terminal device.andP;  Along with a telephone call, a user can sendinformation on the screen or exchange data with a central computer -- all viaone line and one communication number.andM;Data-Communications FeaturesandM;ISDN will provide a number of basic data-communications applications thatshould be available to all users, including electronic mail and compatibilitywith other communications devices such as telex and facsimile transfer.andM;What is clear from these features and the many others is that, to beperformed properly, these applications require access to networks of varyingbandwidths.andM;The 64K-bps restriction that current ISDN standards place on user bandwidthis not sufficient for applications such as large file-transfer, graphics,micro-to-mainframe links and so on.andP;  For these types of applications, theintegrated workstation must have access to a high-speed local area network,either through a direct connection or via the PBX.andM;However, applications such as electronic mail can be handled adequately atlower bandwidths; that is, at 64K bps or less.andM;Though costly in terms of circuit and equipment charges, videoconferencinghas obvious benefits, such as reduced travel costs and better management ofgeographically dispersed plants and offices.andP;  Better methods of video-signalcompression have reduced the band-widths necessary for full-motion, colorvideoconferencing to speeds in the region of 384K bps (corresponding to thecapacity of the proposed ISDN H0 channel).andM;Desktop videoconferencing and video-phone systems that operate at 64K bps areavailable.andP;  While they don't provide the same quality of image as a systemoperating at speeds between 384K bps and 1.544M bps, this is a major step inproviding video communications to all workstation users.andM;During the early 1990s, the next generation of PC/integrated workstationswill provide video communication as a standard application.andM;As ISDN networks continue to emerge in both the public and private sectors,the impetus to develop integrated voice and data workstations will increase.andO;As ISDN and Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standards mature, standardcommunications applications most probably will be built into all PCs.andM;Low-cost ISDN chip sets and an increasing emphasis on OSI applicationstandards will mean that integrated voice and data will become the norm forthe 1990s.andM;ISDN ShortcomingsandM;ISDN is not the solution for all computer-to-computer communications.andO;Perhaps the most obvious shortcoming of ISDN is its limited availablebandwidth.andM;For communicating in and around the office, the 144K-bps Basic Rate Access issignificantly slower than most existing local area networks (which operate atabout 10M bps).andP;  For applications such as file transfer, computer-aideddesign and host-to-host communications, 144K bps isn't fast enough.andP;  Verylarge databases are common in many of today's corporations, and the volume ofinformation being stored electronically is increasing all the time.andM;Local area networks (LANs) are the dominant data-communications medium inmost large corporations.andP;  With the introduction of fiber optics into LANs, astandard transmission rate of 100M bps is readily achievable, either forworkstation-to-workstation communications or as a high-speed linkinterconnecting two or more networks.andM;Given these shortcomings, is ISDN ''too little, too late?'' For many largecorporations with applications that require high-speed local and wide-areadata communications, ISDN in its current format is not enough.andP;  However, notall users have such  requirements.andM;ISDN should be viewed as a means of enhancing the lower levels of acommunications network architecture, providing improved integrated voice anddata communications, better access to public digital networks, and newnetwork services.andM;One of the great strengths of ISDN is the availability of standards.andO;Standard ISDN interfaces can be built into any terminal or PC at low cost,and these interfaces will eventually be compatible throughout the world.andM;Next week, we'll look at the worldwide development of ISDN, focusing on thedifferent approaches to ISDN that have been implemented in Japan, Europe andNorth America.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;  (800) 242-1240.andP;  For information on seminars, pleasecontact (in the United States and Canada) Technology Transfer Institute, 74110th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  90402 (213) 394-8305.andP;  In Europe, contactSavant, 2 New St., Carnforth, Lancs., LA5 9BX United Kingdom (0524) 734 505.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
