That ruling might have gone the other way had the Senate in 1988not rejected President Reagan's nomination of Bork to the SupremeCourt.   Bork says he would have sided with the minority opinion of thefour justices who would have upheld the Texas law banning flagburning. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose nomination was approvedafter Bork was rejected, voted with the court majority in the case.   Now that those decisions are history, the subcommittee is takingtestimony on whether a constitutional amendment banning flag burningis needed, a regular statute would suffice or no remedy is required.   Bork, a former federal appeals court judge who is now with aWashington think tank, said the constitutional amendment approachbacked by President Bush was the only way to go.   ``The matter cannot be cured by statute,'' he said. ``It is idleto suppose that a constitutional ruling can be reversed by stattuteand it would be dangerous to try.''   Also scheduled to testify today was Charles Fried, who served assolicitor general under President Reagan. In that role, he declinedto submit a brief with the Supreme Court in the flag burning case.   On Tuesday, Paul Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation toldthe subcommittee his group had urged Fried to file a brief with thecourt on behalf of the United States ``but to no avail.''   ``There are some who say that if the United States had weighed inon this case with the obvious federal interest involved, we may havegotten the fifth vote we needed and thus would not be here today,''Kamenar said.   Kamenar, whose group filed its own arguments in the case onbehalf of veterans groups and others, said he supports aconstitutional amendment to turn the court ruling around.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas introduced theBush-backed amendment in the Senate on Tuesday, saying there was``no guarantee'' that a regular statute would satisfy the court.   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honorwinner, said his colleagues were jumping too quickly to pushflag-protection legislation in order to gain political capital.   Kerrey said he at first was ``outraged'' by the court, but heread the decision and found it appealing.   ``I was surprised to discover... (it was) reasonable,understandable and consistent with those values which I believe havemade America so wonderful.''   Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe told the Housesubcommittee that the goal of the constitutional amendment could beaccomplished through a statute like one proposed by Senate JudiciaryCommittee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.   Biden would make it a federal crime, punishable by a fine of upto $1,000 and a year's imprisonment _ or both _ for someone toknowingly deface the flag.   The statute would remove all references in the existing federalflag burning statute to ``ideas communicated'' in the process offlag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself.   The Supreme Court held in its 5-4 ruling in the Texas case thatdesecrating the flag was protected under the Constitution's FirstAmendment guarantee of free speech as far as the act of destroyingthe flag was an attempt to communicate a political point of view.</TEXT></DOC>
