(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If the 100 dogs at Nabisco Brands' testingcenter are any indication, the cracker company may have a winner onits hands with its new doggie breath fresheners meant to improveFido's social skills.   The dogs, ``on full-time staff'' at the Sherburne, N.Y., testingcenter, have sampled the new version of Milkbone dog biscuits andare begging for more, Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche said Thursday.   ``They've given it their five-paw rating,'' he said.   The new product combines dog biscuits with breath mints. Thebiscuits, which will debut nationwide by the end of the month, aredesigned to clean teeth like regular Milkbones but also improve adog's breath.   ``There is a problem with halitosis among dogs,'' Gutsche said.``This delivers the regular benefits plus the added benefits ofmint.''   Others were skeptical.   ``Milkbone is a good product, but I don't think anything willwork on a dog's breath except activated charcoal,'' which absorbsodors, said 45-year veteran veterinarian Harold S. Smith of Milford.   A dog's diet, which consists primarily of meat, lends itself tobad breath, said Smith, a past president of the New Jersey StateVeterinarians Association.   ``They don't exactly have the best breath in the world,'' hesaid. ``There's no such thing as baby's breath for a dog.''</TEXT><DATELINE>SURREY, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The tattered object was pink _an unusual color for Alan McFarland to spot in his Iowa farm field_ so he stopped to look.   What he found was a broken balloon with an invitation attachedto visit Surrey. McFarland's first question was, ``Where the SamHill is Surrey?''   It's 1,340 miles northwest of Whiting, Iowa _ as the balloonflies.   McFarland said he was planting soybeans Monday when he found theinvitation to ``visit Surrey, B.C., Canada.''   ``If it hadn't been pink I don't think I would have evenstopped, but that's an unusual color to come across out there inthe dirt,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday with theVancouver Sun. Surrey is a Vancouver suburb.   McFarland, 52, called the Surrey Chamber of Commerce and learnedhis discovery was one of 2,000 helium balloons released Saturday tokick off Tourism Week. Each carried a chance to win a trip toSurrey.   The trip will be awarded to the person farthest from Surrey whofinds a balloon and contacts the chamber of commerce before May 31.   Dianne Rempel of the chamber of commerce said Wednesday that twoballoons recovered in Montana were the only others found outsideBritish Columbia to date.   Meanwhile, a man in Shawnee, Okla., said Thursday he hasn't hadthe same luck tracking down the origins of a balloon he found a fewweeks ago.   Bob James doesn't have any idea just how far the balloontraveled before he snared it behind the factory where he works.Inside, it contained a message from ``Whitmore Elementary,'' butdidn't include the name of the town.   The Oklahoma Education Department checked its records but couldfind no Whitmore Elementary in the state.   James said he and a co-worker spotted the white balloon May 4 asit drifted to the ground. They noticed something inside and jokedabout splitting the contents.   But it contained no promise of a free trip _ only a note abouteating plenty of fruit and getting eight hours of sleep a night.</TEXT></DOC>
