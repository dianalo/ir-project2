Harold Ford (D., Tenn.) and banker C.H. Butcher on conspiracy and fraud charges involving a $350,000 loan shows the Justice Department's increasing interest in public corruption cases.    Rep. Ford, a seven-term lawmaker and a member of one of Tennessee's most prominent political families, was charged last week with conspiring to divert the money through a &quot;sham corporation&quot; to enable him &quot;to live an extravagant and lavish life style, well above his personal means.&quot;    Justice Department officials said they are continuing to investigate whether Mr. Butcher -- who earlier this month pleaded guilty to separate fraud and money-laundering charges -- and his brother, Jake, provided improper loans to other politicians in Tennessee and Kentucky or elsewhere. The Butchers controlled a network of banks in the two states before their financial empire collapsed and they were convicted of bank fraud.    The indictment comes on the heels of extensive public corruption investigations and prosecutions in Miami, Chicago and New York with the help of federal prosecutors.    Assistant Attorney General William Weld, who took over as head of the department's criminal division last year, has told associates that one of his top goals is to step up prosecution of corruption cases involving politicians, local elected officials and police forces.    Rep. Ford couldn't be reached for comment, but he was quoted over the weekend denying the charges and asserting that &quot;there's been no wrongdoing in my association with the Butcher family.&quot; C.H. Butcher and his attorney couldn't be reached for comment. Earlier this month in federal court in Chattanooga, where he pleaded guilty to the bank-fraud charges, Mr. Butcher also agreed to plead guilty to an unspecified future indictment.    According to Friday's indictment by a federal grand jury in Knoxville, Rep. Ford, along with Mr. Butcher and three other associates, also conspired to try to hide the transactions from the Internal Revenue Service, federal bank regulators and bankruptcy court.    In return for the bogus loan, according to the 19-count indictment, Rep. Ford, a ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, was supposed to use his &quot;political influence&quot; to benefit the Butcher family and the other conspirators.    The indictment quotes Memphis attorney Karl Schledwitz, one of those charged in the conspiracy, as describing Rep. Ford as &quot;C.H.'s congressman.&quot; Jake Butcher, who was identified in the indictment as part of the alleged conspiracy but wasn't charged with any crime, was endorsed by Rep. Ford in his unsuccessful 1978 race for governor of Tennessee, according to the court documents.    Mr. Schledwitz couldn't be reached for comment.    Starting from 1976, the indictment lists loans from Butcher-controlled institutions to Rep. Ford or his businesses totaling more than $600,000. Some of the money listed as going to the businesses was used to pay off Rep. Ford's personal debts and mortgages, according to the indictment. The indictment also accused Rep. Ford of failing to include certain debts on his federal financial reports.    When he applied for an auto loan with a Washington bank in 1982, according to the indictment, Rep. Ford also listed his wife as receiving $1,800 a month as a &quot;consultant&quot; to the Butchers.    Also charged were attorney Douglas Beaty and Knoxville accountant David Crabtree. The two allegedly helped set up a &quot;sham corporation&quot; to benefit Rep. Ford and in return, hoped to receive favorable loans or other benefits from C.H. Butcher, according to the indictment. Mr. Crabtree is serving a 15-year jail term for bankruptcy fraud, and Mr. Beaty couldn't be reached.    Jake Butcher was sentenced to jail after pleading guilty in 1985 to charges of bank fraud, conspiracy and income-tax evasion. </TEXT></DOC>
