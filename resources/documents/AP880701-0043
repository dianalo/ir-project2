PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Soviet journalist said four delegates to anationwide Communist Party conference were suspected ofbribe-taking. Tass said the charge was made after a passionatedebate on the power of the press to criticize leaders.   Vitaly Korotich, of the weekly magazine Ogonyok, gave a list ofthe delegates to Mikhail S. Gorbachev at Thursday's session of theparty gathering, but he did not publically identify them, theofficial news agency said. He demanded an investigation of theallegations.   The edition of Ogonyok published Sunday said delegates from theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan had taken bribes. It saidacceptance of bribes by delegates to the first general partyconference in 47 years was an indication that large-scalecorruption still exists in the Central Asian republic.   Korotich said the investigation that uncovered the bribe-takingwas part of a larger probe that implicated the son-in-law of thelate Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.   In January, Tass reported that Brezhnev's relative, YuriChurbanov, would go on trial for accepting bribes equal to 270years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker.   Korotich said the suspected bribe-takers could not be called toaccount because of connections between the courts and the party,Tass reported.   He addressed a session on the third day of the conference. Hisremarks were punctuated by applause and shouts from the floor,where almost 5,000 delegates were seated.   ``I would very much like it if the Party Control Commission andthe general procurator of the Soviet Union at last gave anevaluation of what the investigators are saying, and either punishthose about whom we are talking or punish the investigators andjournalists who allowed themselves to put innocent people undersuspicion,'' he said to loud applause.   In an apparent reference to Korotich later, Uzbekistan partychief Rafik Nishanov said demagogues are operating ``under thecover of perestroika,'' the name Gorbachev has given his plans forsocial and economic reform.   Korotich took the floor after Georgy Razumovsky, head of theconference credentials committee, said a long investigation wouldbe needed to find out if Ogonyok's allegations were true.   The editor said the magazine's material was supplied byinvestigators who still were following a trail of bribery andcorruption tied to former Uzbekistan party leader Sharaf Rashidovand Churbanov. Brezhnev died in 1982 and Rashidov in 1983.   Brezhnev's son-in-law was first deputy interior minister whileBrezhnev was alive but was fired soon afterward. Two Uzbekistanofficials have been executed after being convicted of corruption.   Soviet television showed Korotich, documents in hand, turning tothe dais with Gorbachev directly behind him. After a cut, it showedthe editor answering questions while Gorbachev straightened a sheafof papers.   Korotich would not identify those suspected of bribery, sayingonly: ``The four people listed in the documents are delegates tothe party conference.''   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said Thursday theinvestigation of Churbanov had been completed and he would be triedon charges of systematic bribe-taking along with former UzbekistanInterior Minister K. Yakhyayev, two of Yakhyayev's deputies andfive regional police chiefs.   It said two senior officials implicated in the case committedsuicide, but did not name them.   The bribe-taking allegations were referred to the CredentialsCommittee on Wednesday during a passionate debate about the powerof the state-run press to criticize party and government officials,official reports said. Gorbachev's program of reforms hasemboldened the media to report more openly on once taboo topics.</TEXT></DOC>
