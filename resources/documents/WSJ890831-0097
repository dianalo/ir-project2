But experts say there are clear warning signs. Workaholics crave work like an addictive drug and can't seem to do without it. &quot;They'll be thinking about an assignment while playing golf on Saturday or take mental notes about the office while at a party,&quot; says Mortimer Feinberg, chairman of BFS Psychological Associates, a New York consultant.    Unlike the most effective executives, they haven't learned &quot;to live in air-tight compartments of time, with some space reserved for leisure,&quot; he adds.    At the same time, work doesn't satisfy workaholics. &quot;They're not energized by it because what's driving them is the need to avoid something,&quot; says Beverly A. Potter, a Berkeley, Calif., organizational psychologist and author of &quot;Preventing Job Burnout.&quot;    &quot;Maybe they're in a lousy marriage they can't face,&quot; she adds, &quot;or are frightened of failure at their company.&quot;    Once workaholism sets in, it progresses through stages similar to those in alcoholism and drug addiction. Among these: increased tolerance for more and more work, a feeling that &quot;you can't stop,&quot; and anger and other withdrawal symptoms while away from work.    Workaholics also tend to deny their addiction. &quot;You ask them if their round-the-clock schedules are a problem for them or their families and they insist 'everything's fine,'&quot; says Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, director of the Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla, Calif.    Job Searches Lengthen,    But Pay Grows, Too    OUT-OF-WORK executives can expect to spend more time looking for new jobs this year. But when they finally do land positions, they can count on higher total compensation.    The average time to find a new executive job rose to 5.9 months this year from 5.1 months in 1988, according to a Drake Beam Morin survey of some 1,500 clients looking for work. But total compensation rose almost 9% to $82,440 in 1989 from $75,978 last year.    The brightest spots in the executive job market were marketing and sales, where the number of positions increased 5% and total pay scales rose 10%. But opportunities in general management, finance and accounting declined. And the average search time for a corporate staff position increased to 7.3 months, from 5.3 months last year.    Women managers found jobs faster than men (an average 5.2 months vs. six months). They were behind in pay, though. Their total compensation in new jobs was 26% lower than men's -- $63,339 compared with $86,134.    For both sexes, the old-boy network remains crucial to a job search. Some 64% of the managers surveyed said they landed a new job through a personal contact. Another 12% -- the next largest category -- found positions through a search firm, while 11% answered an ad.    CEOs Are Out of Touch    With Subordinates    NO WONDER so many chief executives complain that it's lonely at the top. Isolated in executive suites, they not only are unaware of what other managers think, but they also aren't being heard themselves.    A new Forum Corp. survey of 611 executives at Fortune 500 companies shows a significant gap between what chief executives consider &quot;extremely important&quot; to their companies and what lower-ranking executives think.    For example, 92% of the CEOs polled rated &quot;quality of customer service&quot; extremely important, compared with 83% of vice presidents. CEOs also placed more importance than subordinates on employee productivity and employee satisfaction.    Conversely, CEOs were far less likely to be concerned with immediate financial results (51% rated them &quot;extremely important,&quot; compared with 70% of vice presidents), and financial community perceptions (43% vs. 55%).    Yet many CEOs have little idea they aren't making themselves heard. A full 82% believe their strategy is &quot;clearly understood to a great extent by everyone who needs to know.&quot; But only 68% of chief operating officers and 76% of vice presidents agreed with that assessment.    ---@ Ranking Priorities @ CHIEF @ OPERATING @ CEO OFFICER VP @ Quality of customer service 92% 87% 83% @ Long-term growth 85 79 78 @ Employee productivity 79 77 70 @ Immediate financial results 51 69 70 @ Employee satifaction 65 61 54 @ Source: Forum Corp., Boston, Mass.    Coats May Be Optional,    But Never Go Tieless    WHETHER a male manager chooses pin stripes or checks is a matter of personal taste, but one dress-for-success rule is sacrosanct: Never forget your tie.    Sixty-nine percent of the personnel directors at 100 Fortune 1000 companies agree &quot;it's never acceptable&quot; not to wear a tie at work, according to a survey by Robert Half International, an executive-search firm.    By contrast, forgoing a jacket is often fine. Some 35% agree it's &quot;generally acceptable,&quot; and another 36% believe shirt sleeves alone are enough &quot;except when meeting with visitors.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
