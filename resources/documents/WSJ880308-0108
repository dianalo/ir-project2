Separately, Texas Air said the new unit, Air-Shuttle L.P., received commitments from two lenders to provide as much as $133 million of financing for the shuttle transaction. As part of the transaction, Texas Air will pay $125 million in cash to Eastern, also a Texas Air unit, along with $100 million of 10-year, 16.5% senior subordinated notes.    Air-Shuttle said it hired Pan Am's former vice president, labor relations, Ray Grebey, to oversee all personnel and labor relations activities of the new unit. Mr. Grebey, who was ousted as part of an executive-suite overhaul at Pan Am in January, had presided over Pan Am's efforts to cut high labor costs.    In his Texas Air post, Mr. Grebey will oversee the tricky job of transferring Eastern employees, who are being offered the approximately 800 Air-Shuttle jobs on a seniority basis. Eastern's unions are currently locked in battle with Texas Air management over labor costs, and have filed suit to block the shuttle sale.    Mr. Grebey follows two other high-ranking Pan Am executives to Texas Air. Bruce R. Nobles, formerly president of Pan Am's shuttle operations, was hired away as Air-Shuttle's president and chief executive officer. Martin R. Shugrue Jr. was named president of Texas Air's Continental Airlines unit after being fired from his job as Pan Am's vice chairman and chief operating officer amid a board fight over the direction of the carrier.    The presence of three former Pan Am executives at Texas Air seems likely to strengthen its edge in the battle for control of the lucrative 4.5 million-passenger-a-year East Coast shuttle market. Both companies provide hourly service between New York and Boston and Washington.    Pan Am has improved its market share from one-fourth to one-third over two years, but Eastern is considered to have a marketing advantage in its more accessible terminal at New York's La Guardia Airport. In New York, a Pan Am spokesman declined to comment.    Air-Shuttle also said it named Charles Bare as director of operations and chief pilot at the new unit. Mr. Bare formerly was chief pilot at New York Air, another Texas Air unit that operated hourly Northeast flights before it was merged into Continental last year. Some analysts have speculated that the Continental shuttle operation, based in Newark, N.J., could eventually be merged into the new Air-Shuttle unit.    Air-Shuttle said it expects to close the sale as early as May, a bit later than previously announced, after the company receives its Federal Aviation Administration operating certificate and other government approvals. </TEXT></DOC>
