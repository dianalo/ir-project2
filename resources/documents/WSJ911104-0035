The Senate's refusal even to consider a wide-rangingenergy bill was a stunning repudiation of an energy packagethe Bush administration had endorsed as balanced, butenvironmentalists had attacked as lopsidedly favoringproduction over conservation.</LP><TEXT>   Oil interests needed 60 votes to break anenvironmentalist-led filibuster against the bill, but theyfell short; the vote was 50-44. The vote severely jeopardizeschances that oil companies will win permission to explore theArctic refuge, a 1.5 million-acre tract of frozen Alaskantundra, for what could be up to 3.57 billion barrels of oil.   &quot;It's clear that this does kill the chances of drilling inthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus(D., Mont.), who led the bipartisan filibuster.   The Bush administration and advocates of oil drilling,though, vowed not to give up. They said they will try toresurrect the bill, though others rated their chances asslim.   Sen. Baucus and others who joined in the filibuster, 35Democrats and nine Republicans in all, said they want torenegotiate and bring to the Senate floor a new energy billthat would place greater stress on energy conservation. ButEnergy Undersecretary Henson Moore and Sen. Malcolm Wallop(R., Wyo.) ruled out any negotiations and said they wanted arepeat vote on the same bill after they have a chance to swaysome senators into switching sides.   The prospects for resurrecting the Alaskan oil-drillingprovisions are especially grim; they enjoyed their bestclimate for adoption in years. The Persian Gulf War, foughtpartly to protect oil supplies, and the recent settlement ofcharges against Exxon Corp. for its 1989 Valdez oil spillshould have smoothed the way for acceptance of more oilexploration in the area considered the nation's hottestprospect.   While environmentalists' opposition to the Alaskandrilling was the main reason for the bill's demise, thevoluminous energy package was also doomed because itcontained something for almost everybody to hate. Resistancesurfaced to provisions that would help deregulate thegeneration of electricity, speed up the licensing of nuclearpower plants and boost fuel-efficiency standards for autos.   Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska), stung by the oildrilling defeat, accused &quot;auto industry forces&quot; of joiningwith environmentalists in an unholy alliance to preventchanges in fuel-mileage standards. But Michael Stanton,lobbyist for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association,insisted the auto industry had refused to take a position onthe filibuster vote. &quot;We really and truly didn't doanything,&quot; he said.   While the energy package wouldn't have mandated anyspecific improvements in auto gasoline mileage, the Senatecertainly would have been faced with an attempt by Sen.Richard Bryan (D., Nev.) to insert his proposal that cars getan average of 40 miles per gallon by the year 2000, comparedwith 27.5 mpg currently. Ironically, Mr. Bryan's bill waskilled by a similar filibuster last year.   Mr. Bryan said he still intends to push his proposal,which has cleared the Senate Commerce Committee, but heacknowledged that &quot;time runs against us doing somethingimmediately.&quot; The Senate hopes to recess for the year beforeThanksgiving.   The energy package also would have streamlined natural-gasregulation and boosted use of alternative car fuels. Byrefusing even to begin debate on it, theDemocratic-controlled Senate opens itself up to politicalbashing by Republicans. President Bush already has begunderiding Congress for impeding his domestic agenda.   &quot;The Senate won't even bring this bill up for debate, andthey know how important it is for American jobs and to cutour foreign trade deficit,&quot; Energy Secretary James Watkinssaid in a statement.   The House also is considering energy legislation. Apackage of reforms this week cleared a House energysubcommittee chaired by Rep. Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), but itdoesn't broach either of the two hottest issues: Alaskandrilling or auto fuel economy. House Energy Chairman JohnDingell (D., Mich.), the auto industry's biggest protector inCongress, has indicated he wants to wait until the Senateacts, or at least until a National Academy of Sciences studyon auto fuel economy is issued, to begin work on a bill.</TEXT></DOC>
