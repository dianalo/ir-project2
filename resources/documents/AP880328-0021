At the same time, miles away in Flint, 40 people were turnedaway from the overflowing church where Jesse Jackson was speaking.So they gathered around a television station's truck to watchJackson on the monitors.   Campaign events are an uncertain barometer of election success,but in Michigan, the developments on Friday were an excellentforecaster of the results on Saturday.   Dukakis had a difficult day _ a schedule snarled by logisticalproblems and a sometimes testy response from some spectators.   In contrast, Jackson was drawing substantial, enthusiasticcrowds as he motored across the state.   And on Saturday, that enthusiasm turned into votes that gaveJackson an overwhelming victory, crushing Dukakis by nearly 2-1 inthe big industrial state.   ``I think the major factor was the level of intensity of Jacksonsupporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters,''Michigan House Speaker Gary Owen said.   Owen said he found ``an overwhelming lack of enthusiasm'' foreverybody but Jackson. Owen supports Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.   As expected, Jackson swept the black vote by margins of up to15-1. But he did well in others parts of the state with smallminority populations, winning 10 of the state's 18 congressionaldistricts.   Jackson knows well the dubious reliability of rallies and townmeetings as indicators of political success. He drew big crowds in1984 and still finished third in the Democratic presidential racethat year.   But in Michigan this time, the indicators were right on themoney.   ``In some sense, it's a lot of poetry,'' Jackson said inMilwaukee late Saturday. ``It's a lot of history. We also have thenumbers, and it's a lot of reality.''   At the Hamtramck event, the audience was no longer so small asto be embarrassing when Dukakis arrived with Detroit Mayor ColemanYoung, Sen. Don Riegle and others. But at least a quarter of thecrowd was made up of reporters and plainclothes policemen.   Earlier that day in Detroit, two plainclothes policemen stoppeda reporter and asked why a crowd had gathered down the street. Toldthat Jesse Jackson was speaking, the two parked _ and went insidethe union hall to listen.   Crowds generally waited patiently for Jackson to appear. But inComstock Park, the grumbling was evident when Dukakis arrived abouthalf an hour late due to logistical problems that wiped out many ofhis planned events.   ``Make them wait _ we did,'' yelled one older man as Dukakis cutshort his town meeting in the Grand Rapids suburb to hold a newsconference and rush to a fund-raiser.   ``Speak English _ this is America,'' said another as Dukakisspoke in Greek and Spanish with those in the UAW hall who addressedhim in those languages.   Jackson worked this state hard, even delaying his departure fromthe state on Saturday to motorcade and walk through mostly blackneighborhoods, encouraging his supporters to turn out.   Dukakis spent less time in the state. He flew in Monday nightfor a quick visit, held a pair of news conferences Wednesday nightand then muddled through the day Friday.   Part of the difference in schedules came from Dukakis'commitment to return to Boston to work as governor, part fromDukakis' greater attention to fund-raising and part from campaignjudgments about allocating candidate's time among the variousstates.   And when Dukakis was in the state, he found himself explainingover and over again that he had not flip-flopped on the tradeissue, that his backing for a trade bill by Sen. Don Riegle ofMichigan was not just a political ploy. Rep. Richard Gephardtgrabbed the front pages by pounding away at Dukakis on trade.   It didn't help Gephardt _ he finished a dismal third _ but theblows kept Dukakis on the defensive.   The messages from the two candidates were also substantivelydifferent. Dukakis talked of competence and compassion, as histelevisions ads emphasized balancing budgets and creating jobs.   Jackson hit over and over again at his theme of hope for thosewho are down, who are jobless, who are out of luck.   In a state where the auto industry has put thousands out ofwork, Jackson's more optimistic message was the stronger one _ asDukakis came close to admitting Saturday night in defeat.   ``The people of Michigan have been through a very difficulttime. There is great unhappiness, great concern, great uncertainty.There are laid-off workers. Workers today who have jobs are worriedthey are going to be next,'' Dukakis said. ``Jesse has strongfeelings about that _ as I do.''   Dukakis relied on an impressive organization in Michigan, as hehas in other states, plus endorsements from Young and Riegle.   Jackson had a good organization himself in Michigan and spentabout $90,000 on paid media. But he couldn't resist a swipe atDukakis.   ``It was the message of the soul and authenticity of JesseJackson versus money and technology _ and the people prevailed,''Jackson told supporters Sunday at Westchester County Airport in NewYork.   ``Everybody won something in Detroit,'' Jackson said when thevotes were counted. ``Dukakis won Mayor Young's endorsement. I wonthe people's votes.''</TEXT></DOC>
