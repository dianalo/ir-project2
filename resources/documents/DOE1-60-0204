The overall objectives of this study weretwo-fold. The first was to acquire and document the operating loads andperformance parameters for the NPS 125kW wind Turbine. The second wasto map the inflow characteristics of a typical complex terrain site andcorrelate measured wind statistics with the wind turbine's dynamic responsein order to develop a better understanding of dynamic loads and fatigue.Select data segments are analyzed from a testing of the NPS test sitein Altamont Pass, California. Firs, baseline machine operating parametersare analyzed using the method of bins. Second, load statistics are binnedon blade azimuth position to delineate the mean loads from the stochasticloads. These select data segments were chosen to span the range of operatingwind speeds for the machine. The inflow of the wind turbine was mappedusing a vertical plane array (VPA) which consisted of eleven UVW propeller-typeanemometers located 0.6 rotor diameters upwind of the wind turbine. Also,1.5 rotor diameters upwind of the turbine, a single tower with sevenlevels of anemometers was used. The dynamic response of the rotor wasmonitored with 16 channels of blade and hug-bending moment measurementsincluding low speed shaft torque. The machine performance was determinedfrom 16 channels of data taken from the stationary reference frame includinggenerator power output. The results presented include power output andhub loads against disk average wind speed used to characterize machineperformance parameters. Mean hub loads are plotted against rotor azimuthposition, and power spectral density functions are presented for out-of-planehub-bending moments to determine the turbine's dynamic response to turbulentwind inputs.</TEXT></DOC>
