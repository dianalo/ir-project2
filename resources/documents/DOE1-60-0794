First, even in human populationswith a long history of inbreeding, appreciable levels of genetic variabilitycan be maintained. Second, the investigation of genetic variability viahealth-based, prospective screening programmes already is feasible andof community benefit in developing countries. Finally, the widespreadintroduction of programmes of this type in other tropical populationswhether with similar consanguineous marriage customs or practising outbreedingis both desirable and warranted to biological, social and health grounds.</TEXT></DOC>
