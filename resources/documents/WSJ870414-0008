GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., said earnings declined 6% to $264.7 million, or 78 cents a share, from $282.8 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share earnings reflect a 3-for-2 stock split in January. The company also said there were 3% fewer shares a year earlier. The year-earlier period included results from businesses transferred to Siemens AG last year as part of a joint venture between GTE and the West German electronics and engineering concern.    The latest period's earning received a boost of $24 million, or seven cents a share, from a change made Jan. 1 in GTE's method of accounting for pension costs. The company said the increase isn't &quot;indicative of the (earnings) impact in subsequent&quot; quarters.    GTE's quarterly revenue rose 4% to $3.69 billion from $3.56 billion.    In Kansas City, Mo., United Telecommunications said net income for the first quarter plunged to $13.5 million, or 13 cents a share, from $46.4 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.    United Telecom officials said first-quarter earnings reflected toll fraud on the company's US Sprint long-distance network. William T. Esrey, president, said costs from fraudulent use of authorization codes masked progress made with the Sprint network.    Revenue was $573 million, up 2.6% from $558.7 million a year earlier.    US Sprint had pre-tax losses of $242 million in the quarter, of which GTE absorbed half, or $121 million before taxes. In the year-earlier quarter, before GTE and United Telecommunications combined their long-distance operations, US Sprint had a pre-tax loss of $60 million. Sprint revenue rose 30% to $615 million. GTE formerly held 100% of Sprint.    GTE, which has said US Sprint's losses would persist throughout the year, blamed the Sprint losses in the quarter on lower prices and higher operating costs.    The losses also reflected the illegal use of the telephone company's access codes by the public. As a result, US Sprint gave rebates of $19 million in the quarter to customers who had been overcharged.    However, a spokesman added, &quot;We expect the losses to begin to diminish in the third quarter.&quot;    &quot;That would be primarily due to our being able to transfer traffic from the interim networks in place to Sprint's fiber-optic network,&quot; the spokesman continued. US Sprint, for instance, spends $300 million a year leasing lines from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., he said. He added that US Sprint already has installed 70% of its planned 23,000-mile network.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, GTE closed at $38, down $1.125, while United Telecommunications closed at $28, down 50 cents.    Meanwhile, GTE's local telephone operations and electrical products unit &quot;posted another strong quarter,&quot; Theodore F. Brophy, GTE's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.    The telephone unit, the largest local telephone company in the U.S., posted pre-tax earnings of $736 million, up 8% from a year earlier; revenue rose 8% to $2.9 billion.    The electrical products unit, which makes Sylvania light bulbs, had quarterly pre-tax earnings of $55 million, an increase of 20% from a year earlier. Sales rose 11% to $510 million, largely because of higher shipments of lighting products and a boost from foreign-currency translations, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
