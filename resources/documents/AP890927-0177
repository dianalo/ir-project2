Savimbi's plan, outlined to a congress of his National Union forthe Total Independence of Angola at his bush headquarters in Jamba,southeastern Angola, was reported by the British Broadcasting Corp.in London and Correio da Manha, a Portuguese newspaper in Lisbon.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas are proposing direct talks with theMarxist government that won power shortly after independence fromPortugal in 1975; a cease-fire and release of all politicalprisoners; a transitional government of national unity; immediatere-writing of the constitution; and free and fair elections.   According to the reports, the plan calls for a monitoring forcefrom several African nations to supervise the cease-fire threemonths after it begins, formation of a transitional governmentwithin nine months and, six months later, elections supervised bythe United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.   A June 24 cease-fire mediated by Zaire's President Mobutu SeseSeko quickly broke down, with each side blaming the other.   Efforts to bring them together for new talks have failed. Lastmonth, eight African leaders endorsed the Angolan government'speace plan, which calls for Savimbi to be exiled from the countryduring a transitional period and for his forces to be absorbed intothe present government.   Savimbi says he will not consider leaving the country and thathis forces have not been defeated and would not accept integrationinto the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, ledby President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.   South Africa provided military aid to the guerrillas during muchof the civil war, but agreed to halt that assistance as part of aregional peace plan that includes the withdrawal of the 50,000Cuban troops in Angola.   The United States continues to aid the guerrilla movement, andthe Soviet Union still supports dos Santos' government.   The State Department has supported Savimbi's insistence thatelections be held in Angola.   His movement never has had a chance to test its popularity atthe polls. The Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from thecountry in 1975, leaving three rival factions to fight for power.Dos Santos' group won.</TEXT></DOC>
