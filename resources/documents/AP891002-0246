The storm, caused by the bombardment of energy from solaractivity, is making the shimmering aurora borealis brighter, morecolorful and more spectacular than usual this year.   Unni Pia Loevhaug, a space researcher, plans to fire bolts ofelectricity at the ionosphere, the layer of Earth's atmosphere thatacts like a movie screen for the solar lights, to get an evenbetter picture.   The study should offer insights into the universe and theoriesof physics and ``increase man's storehouse of knowledge,'' she said.   Her work may have practical applications in helping to overcomethe havoc that the electrically charged lights can play with radiocommunications and navigation.   In Tromsoe, 185 miles north of the Arctic Cicle, the tourismboard is thankful for the aurora borealis, which has drawn thecurious and adventurous for hundreds of years.   These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of solar winds,bursts of energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million milesthrough space and slam into the Earth's magnetic field at a speedof 1.56 million miles an hour.   The collision releases the storm of energy seen in theconstantly changing lights. Over the South Pole they are called theaurora australis.   ``It's absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here inthe north,'' said tourist official Gunn Sissel Jaklin.   ``The aurora will just keep getting better and better from nowuntil 1994 because the 11-year solar cycle is moving toward apeak.''   Space researcher Loevhaug keeps tabs on the lights summer andwinter, even when they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun.   ``We're already seeing things that I have never witnessedbefore,'' she said. She has studied the lights since 1983.   From her laboratory 18 miles outside town, the 33-year-oldphysicist is taking part in European Incoherent Scatter Radar(EISCAT), a project launched in 1981 to study the northern lightsand the Earth's outer atmosphere.   EISCAT's studies are funded by Britain, France, West Germany,Norway, Sweden and Finland.   A transmitter fed by five megawatts of power, enough to light asmall village, bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1,250miles above the Earth. Signals are picked up in Sweden and Finlandand relayed to Tromsoe.   ``A radar wave is an electromagnetic field,'' Loevhaug said.``It scatters through the northern lights and we receive a pictureof what is going on. When solar activity builds up, it amplifiesthe lights and makes our studies easier.''   It took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares,tongues of fire that leap thousands of miles above the sun'ssurface, caused the lights.   The Vikings believed the lights were flashes from the shields ofwarriors bound for heavenly Valhalla. Eskimos imagined dangerousspirits, while Swedes thought it was the torchlight of Lappsstalking stray reindeer.   Centuries ago, Tromsoe's people feared that laughing at thenorthern lights would anger the gods, who would strike them lame.   The aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the ArcticCircle. It was mentioned in the Bible and pondered by Greekphilospher Aristotle 2,500 years ago.   Even though lights are commonly seen in Tromsoe, ``a colorfuldisplay makes everyone drop what they are doing to watch,'' saidJaklin, the tourism official.   ``They look fantastic even when you understand them,'' saidLoevhaug.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs Oct. 10</NOTE></DOC>
