U.S. District Judge William Dwyer recommended that StellaNickell not be eligible for parole for a minimum of 30 years,saying, ``The jury has found the defendant guilty of appallingcrimes.''   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, sat at the defense tablewith her hands tightly clasped in her lap, her fingers intertwinedand her thumbs fidgeting. She appeared to pale when the sentencewas read.   ``It must be said that these are crimes of exceptionalcallousness and cruelty,'' Dwyer said, taking note of the fact thatthe poisoned capsules had been left on store shelves and could haveeasily fallen into the hands of innocent victims.   Mrs. Nickell received 90-year terms each for two counts ofproducting tampering that resulted in the deaths of her husband,Bruce Nickell, and Susan Katherine Snow of Auburn. She facedpossible life terms on those two counts.   Additionally she was sentenced to three 10-year terms for lacingwith cyanide Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules found in the Nickellhome and on the shelves of area stores.   All terms were to run concurrently.   Prosecutors had requested a sentence of 230 years, with aminimum of 67 years served before she would be eligible for parole,saying entire families could have died because of the tampering.   ``It is unnerving to think just how many people stood to diebecause of this woman's greed,'' said U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida,who prosecuted the case.   ``It was a tough case,'' said Mrs. Nickell's attorney, ThomasHillier, who told Dwyer during the hearing that he was working onan appeal of her conviction. ``We expected a tough sentence. Wewere prepared for it. We were prepared for worse.   On Thursday, Dwyer rejected Mrs. Nickell's try to win a newtrial, saying she her guilt was determined by ``an attentive,thorough and impartial jury.''   Hillier had sought a new trial on grounds that juror LaurelHolliday didn't mention during jury selection that three monthsbefore the trial, she had accepted $500 in an out-of-courtsettlement of her own product-contamination lawsuit against acracker manufacturer.   Prosecutors argued there was no evidence Ms. Holliday wasbiased, and, in fact, she was the only juror arguing for acquittalduring deliberations. She later changed her vote to guilty.   In a 28-page ruling, Dwyer said there was no evidence Ms.Holliday answered jury selection questions dishonestly.   Even if all the facts known after the trial had been brought outduring jury selection, Dwyer said, there would not have beengrounds to excuse Ms. Holliday for cause.   Mrs. Nickell was convicted May 9 of five counts of producttampering, including two that resulted in the June 1986 deaths ofher husband and Ms. Snow.   She was the first person in the United States brought to trialunder a federal law concerning death by product tampering.   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng has said he would wait untilafter sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges.   Prosecutors alleged Mrs. Nickell killed her husband because shewas tired of him and wanted to collect $176,000 in life insurance.They said Mrs. Snow, who had no connection with the couple, was aninnocent victim of a plot to make Nickell's death appear to be thework of a random killer.   In addition to the tamperings that caused the deaths, Mrs.Nickell was convicted of one count of putting cyanide in a secondbottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin found in her home and two countsof putting the poison in two other bottles found on store shelvesin Auburn and Kent.   Federal prosecutors had asked Dwyer in their sentencingmemorandum to give Mrs. Nickell 100 years on each of the deathcounts and the maximum 10 years on the three other counts, with theterms to run consecutively.   Mrs. Nickell, they wrote, ``willingly risked the lives ofcountless other human beings'' to conceal her identity as herhusband's killer, ``an unconscionable, unforgiveable act againsthumanity which not only justifies but compels the most seriouspunishment available to this court.''   The deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and causedExcedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its non-prescriptioncapsule medicines.   Seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from cyanide-lacedExtra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved.</TEXT></DOC>
