Emmett, has a vision of the personal-care products company's future that is almost directly opposed to the diversification effort that failed his predecessor.    In an interview prior to a planned meeting with securities analysts, Mr. Emmett outlined plans to &quot;sharpen the focus&quot; around the Lake Success, N.Y., company's core business, Tampax tampons, and to continue streamlining the company, which already has a debt-free balance sheet, through sales of units and continued reductions in management.    Mr. Emmett, a former investment banker and consumer products executive, became Tambrands chairman and chief executive in April. His predecessor, Edwin H. Shutt Jr., had been expected to diversify the company away from its focus on Tampax tampons, but the bulk of the company's earnings continue to come from tampons. Mr. Shutt resigned in February. And Tambrands President John F. Bard resigned in late August amid a management reorganization. Other executive changes are likely, Mr. Emmett said.    In the past few weeks, Tambrands stock has run up near its 52-week high of $76.50 on speculation about a possible takeover. Mr. Emmett wouldn't comment on the rumors, and reiterated Tambrands' wish to remain independent. &quot;We have a full line of defenses in place should someone surface,&quot; he says. The executive attributes the stock price rise largely to takeover speculation and, to a lesser extent, to underlying forces recognizing the recent streamlining efforts. The shares closed yesterday at $72, off $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Observers say an offer by Johnson andamp; Johnson, which has denied rumors it is interested, would face antitrust difficulties, and Tambrands, trading very close to what analysts say is its break-up value, wouldn't come cheap to an outside leveraged buy-out firm lacking distribution and marketing outlets.    Mr. Emmett characterized 1989 as a &quot;transition year&quot; and declined to make specific projections on earnings. For the second quarter, Tambrands earned $26.2 million, or $1.17 a share, on sales of $166.1 million. Over the next five years, Mr. Emmett expects the overall $1.6 billion sanitary protection industry market to increase 1% a year in volume and 5% a year in dollars.    In the same period, Mr. Emmett expects the tampon share of the sanitary protection market, the focus of his long-term plan, to increase to about 40% from its current 36.4%, and to increase the Tampax share of the U.S. tampon market 1% a year over the next five years, to 65% from the current 60%. Tampons had a loss of market share following the toxic shock scare almost a decade ago.    Although he hopes to cut advertising, research and development and administrative expenses 15% to 20%, Mr. Emmett plans to take a much more aggressive marketing stance, aimed at &quot;a better definition of the product&quot; on the shelf. He says confusion exists in distinguishing between various types of tampons, and the company wants &quot;to correct it without taking away from the flagship&quot; brand. </TEXT></DOC>
