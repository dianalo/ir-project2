The government also warned Britonsto get out of Lebanon.   The Foreign Office said the 150 Britons in Lebanon are under``increased threat'' from kidnappers following Iran's severing ofdiplomatic relations Tuesday with Britain over Rushdie's novel,``The Satanic Verses.''   Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   An Iranian newspaper, Kayhan International, said the diplomaticbreak ``will leave its negative impact on the fate of the Britishhostages.''   In Beirut, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holdstwo American hostages, said it has completed plans to kill Rushdiebut will first attack British police to get to him.   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family, hasbeen in hiding since Feb. 14, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ofIran sentenced him to death for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''Rushdie is believed to be under police guard in Britain.   In Washington, an FBI official said ``zealous'' Iranian studentsin the United States pose the greatest threat toward publishers andothers over the novel.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Britain is expelling theIranians because of Khomeini's refusal to revoke the death sentence.   ``We have therefore decided on security grounds a number ofIranians must be required to leave this country,'' Howe told theHouse of Commons. ``We are keeping the activities of other Iraniansunder very close review.''   Howe also announced Britain ordered the closure of the Iranianconsulate in Hong Kong, a British colony. He said the staff had twoweeks to leave.   Using his strongest language since the controversy began, Howecalled the Iranian government a ``deplorable regime'' and did notrule out the possibility of ending all trade with Iran, saying, ``Westand ready to take whatever action may be necessary in the light ofevents.''   A break in economic ties would prevent Britain from winninglucrative contracts to help Iran's postwar reconstruction, estimatedto cost $500 billion. The move also comes at a time when Iran hadbeen seeking to expand its ties with the West.   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said upto 30 Iranians ``who are held to be close to the regime'' will beexpelled soon. There are about 25,000 Iranians in Britain, including2,400 students.   Iran severed relations with a week after demanding Britaindenounce Rushdie and ban his novel, which Moslems say blasphemesIslam.   Kayhan International and another Tehran newspaper, Abrar, saidIran may cut ties with nations that supported Britain and recalledtheir envoys. These include Britain's 11 European Economic Communitypartners as well as Canada, Sweden and Norway.   Abrar also called for an end to economic ties with Britain.   British officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgovernment has no plans to stop trade with Iran. But one seniorofficial said, ``If the Iranians want to start a trade war, wereckon they would lose.''   In Beirut, Lebanon, the British Embassy advised Britons not totravel to Lebanon ``as a result of the issue of author SalmanRushdie.'' It urged those in the country to leave as soon aspossible.   The warning was broadcast by the Christian-run Voice of Lebanonradio.   The British hostages _ Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite,journalist John McCarthy, and teacher Brian Keenan _ all arebelieved held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.   The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holdsAmericans Edward Austin Tracy and Joseph James Cicippio, saidWednesday it has ``completed its preparations to execute the justsentence issued'' by Khomeini.   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares thatbefore taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attackBritish police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order toget to him,'' the statement added. It was accompanied by aphotograph of Tracy, but it did not threaten hostages.   A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain took the threat seriously.   ``I don't think we can do more than remain in a state ofpreparedness. Rushdie will continue to have the full protection ofthe law,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   An FBI investigator, Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, told a Congressionalhearing thousands of ``zealous'' Iranians in the United Statesillegally or on student visas could be a bigger threat than thoseknown to have links to terrorist networks.   This is because they are not monitored and because the StateDepartment's standards for issuing visas are lax, he told the SenateForeign Relations subcommittee on terrorism.</TEXT></DOC>
