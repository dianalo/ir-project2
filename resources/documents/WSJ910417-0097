Net income fell to $40.2 million, or 25 cents a share,from the year-earlier $134.5 million or $1.01 a share.Revenue was flat at $4.8 billion.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is the first time that all three of these corecommercial markets simultaneously have been at the bottom oftheir industry cycles,&quot; said Robert F. Daniell, chairman andchief executive officer.   And, he added, &quot;we are not running our businesses on theassumption that the recession is nearing an end.&quot;   The extent of the earnings decline came as a shock to someanalysts, even though the company had warned Wall Streetearlier this year that its 1991 outlook was less thansanguine. &quot;The numbers cannot be characterized as anythingshort of disappointment,&quot; said Howard Rubel, an analyst withC.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;Everything that's badwith the economy is showing up in UTC's earnings.&quot;   He had expected the earnings to be down, at worst, 35%from a year ago, and the company to post net of 65 cents ashare. He said the $4.65 a share he was expecting the companyto post for 1991 &quot;is high by a substantial amount.&quot;   The results were announced after the market's closeyesterday when United Technologies closed at $46.50 a share,down $1.125 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.   UTC said its aircraft engine power segment's operatingprofit fell to $113 million, down from $249 million a yearago. The company said that sharply reduced airline travel andpoor financial results at airlines accounted for more than a25% reduction in commercial spare parts revenue at the Prattandamp; Whitney unit, which accounts for the bulk of the Powersegment business.   The company said Pratt andamp; Whitney's commercial jet enginebusiness also has been hurt by reduced air travel and thesituation is expected to continue during the second quarterof 1991.   Profit at the company's Building Systems segment droppedto $31 million from $90 million last year, primarily on poorperformance by Carrier Corp. unit's Brazilian and NorthAmerican operations. Carrier makes heating and refrigerationsystems for home and industrial uses.   UTC attributed half of the segment's earnings decline toits Brazilian operation. A company spokesman said a newlyinstituted government economic policy had the effect ofcontracting demand and that, in turn, reduced Carrier'ssales.   A significant drop in housing starts and nonresidentialconstruction hurt Carrier's North American operations. Thecompany said its Otis unit, which makes elevators, postedslightly lower earnings from the strong year-ago period.   The company's industrial segment had a loss of $5 millionin the first quarter, against a $15 million profit last year.Revenue declined $172 million to $465 million. UnitedTechnologies blamed Detroit's poor car and truck output,which it said was the lowest since 1982. Its industrialsegment is a major supplier of automotive parts andcomponents.   In light of the dismal results, UTC said it will continuecost-cutting measures. Earlier this year, Mr. Daniell, thechairman, said the company would undertake such measures, andsubsequently the company delayed merit pay increases andreduced the work force at several facilities. A spokesmanyesterday didn't elaborate about additional measurescontemplated.</TEXT></DOC>
