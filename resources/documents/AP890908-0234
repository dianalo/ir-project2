ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco Inc. has put together a good trackrecord in the four months since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. boughtthe food and tobacco giant in the biggest corporate acquisitionever, securities analysts say.   The announcement Thursday that RJR Nabisco would sell the freshfruit operations of its Del Monte Corp. to the British conglomeratePolly Peck International PLC for $875 million bolstered the viewthat the company is taking the right steps to ensure its financialstability.   The sale was part of a divestment plan to help defray the costsof the $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco completed inlate April. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired with mainlyborrowed funds, which are paid back through asset sales and thecompany's cash flow.   The Wall Street Journal reported today that RJR Nabisco expectedto sell Del Monte's canned food business to a Citicorp VentureCapital-led group for about $1.48 billion. The Journal said theprice fell short of what RJR Nabisco hoped to get for the division,and that other segments of the company might have to be sold.   David Kalis, an RJR Nabisco spokesman, said the company had nocomment on the report.   Kohlberg Kravis, a specialist in leveraged buyouts, said earlierthis year that about $5.5 billion in RJR Nabisco assets would besold. The latest sale puts RJR Nabisco more than halfway toward itsdivestment goal.   Moody's Investors Service Inc., a company that rates thecreditworthiness of bond issuers like RJR Nabisco, ``has confidencein management's ability to do what they are in fact doing,'' GloriaVila, a Moody's analyst, said Thursday.   She said the asset sale plan is on track and that the prices RJRNabisco has received for its businesses were so far in line withexpectations.   The biggest asset sale to date came in June, when RJR Nabiscosold five of its European businesses to BSN, a French food andbeverage company, for $2.5 billion.   The company also sold its biscuit and food businesses in Indiaand Pakistan for $44 million to Britannia Industries Pte. Ltd. ofSingapore, and its Chun King food division for $52 million to agroup of investors from Singapore.   Both Moody's and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., another credit-ratingservice, lowered their ratings on RJR Nabisco's bonds and other debtafter the acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis. It is common for acompany's credit rating to be downgraded if it takes on a heavy debtload.   Bond investors apparently have had few doubts about RJR Nabisco.They scooped up the record $4 billion in junk bonds issued as partof the buyout.   Moody's did not plan any further adjustments in its rating of RJRNabisco debt, although the service was confident ``that they aregoing to be able to complete their asset sales on time and at pricesthat they indicated,'' Ms. Vila said.   She noted that the company has had a drop in the volume of itsdomestic tobacco business, which could raise concern about RJRNabisco's cash flow and in turn, its ability to repay its debt.   However, the drop in volume was being offset by price increases,and RJR Nabisco was reconsidering its marketing strategy to find away to boost sales, she said.   There was no connection between the falloff in volume and thebuyout, Ms. Vila said, noting that RJR Nabisco's cigarette brandshave been slipping in the United States for the last five years.   RJR Nabisco got another vote of confidence recently when theinvestment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. added to its ``buy'' list thesecurities Kohlberg Kravis issued to shareholders as part of themerger deal.   The securities, known as a ``stub,'' are debentures, or bonds,that can be converted into stock in the future.   Salomon called the stub ``an attractive way to participate in theequity of the RJR leveraged buyout.''   The investment firm also was pleased with RJR Nabisco's projectedprofit growth, which Salomon put at 15 percent.   The success of the RJR Nabisco deal is crucial to the reputationof Kohlberg Kravis, the leader among firms that specialize inleveraged buyouts.   Kohlberg Kravis reportedly has had trouble selling some of itsbusinesses and several others either are foundering or have beendisappointing investments.   Seaman's Furniture Co., which went private in a $360 millionbuyout led by Kohlberg Kravis two years ago, has said it mustrenegotiate debt payments, partly because sales growth has not metexpectations.   Adding to the company's troubles was a lawsuit filed against itlast month by Jerome Kohlberg Jr., one of its founders. Kohlbergalleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies KohlbergKravis acquired while he was a managing partner there.</TEXT></DOC>
