Beverly Seymour, 45, claimed she shot Richard Reams, 47, whiletrying to protect herself.   Ms. Seymour showed no reaction when Judge William Ammer ofPickaway County Common Pleas Court sentenced her to eight years inprison for voluntary manslaughter plus three years because she useda handgun.   She will be eligible for parole after 8{ years in prison.   Ms. Seymour was originally charged with murder in the slaying.But after a three-week trial, the jury convicted her Thursday ofthe lesser charge.   In a statement before her sentencing, Ms. Seymour told the judgethat Reams had beaten her and was about to again when she shot him.Her trial defense had been that the gun fired accidentally.   ``I'm guilty of being a woman not wanting to be hit by thatman's fists again,'' she said.   Defense lawyers didn't say whether they would appeal.   The slaying of Reams followed a three-way custody battle for5-year-old Tessa Reams. Ms.   Tessa was born in 1985 to Norma Lee Stotski, who was paid$10,000 to be artificially inseminated and bear a child for thecouple. The sperm was from a donor other than Reams.   The couple divorced in 1986. Reams and Ms. Seymour fought overthe girl's custody as did Ms. Stotski.   A juvenile court judge ultimately awarded Reams permanentcustody of the child and gave Ms. Seymoure visitation rights. Ms.Stotski won no rights to see the child.   Reams was shot Aug. 27, the day he went to Ms. Seymour'sapartment to pick up Tessa after his court victory.   At her trial, Ms. Seymour claimed Reams was shot during aconfrontation when she went for her gun and it accidentallydischarged.   But prosecutor Randy Knece said Ms. Seymour killed Reams becauseshe was angry he had won custody of the child.   Ms. Stotski sought Tessa's custody after the shooting, butpermanent custody was awarded to Franklin County Children'sServices.</TEXT></DOC>
