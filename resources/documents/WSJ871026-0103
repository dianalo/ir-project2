SeibStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SUPREME COURT (SUP)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the battle over Judge Robert Bork behind him, President Reagan began looking for a new Supreme Court nominee, one likely to be conservative but perhaps less controversial.    Shortly before the final 58-42 Senate vote to reject Judge Bork, Mr. Reagan on Friday met with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, Attorney General Edwin Meese and others to go over a list of more than a dozen names, many of them federal appeals court judges.    An announcement of a new nominee is expected this week. But the decision may come late in the week to give administration officials time first to show a list of names to Senate leaders and to allow Mr. Meese to return from California, where he is attending a memorial service for his grandson who died last week.    Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Friday that he expects to meet with Mr. Baker this afternoon or tomorrow to be shown a list of names.    Among those considered high on the list of names are U.S. Court of Appeals Judges Anthony Kennedy of Sacramento, Calif.; Ralph Winter of New Haven, Conn.; Pasco Bowman of Kansas City, Mo.; Laurence Silberman and Douglas Ginsburg of Washington, D.C., and J. Clifford Wallace of San Diego.    Other names said to be on the list are U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer of Los Angeles and U.S. Court of Appeals Judges Cynthia Hall of Los Angeles, Edith Jones of Houston, Peter Fay of Miami, Gerald Tjoflat of Jacksonville, Fla., and Roger Miner of Albany, N.Y.    The White House is under some pressure to move quickly. President Reagan would like the Senate to act on the nomination before the end of the year. Whether that happens will depend on scheduling and on how controversial the selection is. If the confirmation process is pushed into 1988, the last year of Mr. Reagan's presidency, opponents might be able to stall deliberations long enough that the president won't get to fill the vacancy at all.    The Senate is scheduled to recess for the year on Nov. 21, but many Senate aides expect that date to be pushed back to mid-December. Sen. Biden said on Friday, &quot;I don't see any possibility&quot; of the next nominee being confirmed by Thanksgiving. But if the Senate is in session in December, action is possible then on a Supreme Court vacancy. If the next selection proves as controversial as Judge Bork, however, Senate action is likely to be delayed until next year.    After the Senate rejected Judge Bork, President Reagan vowed in a statement: &quot;My next nominee for the court will share Judge Bork's belief in judicial restraint -- that a judge is bound by the Constitution to interpret laws, not make them.&quot;    Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, urged a choice who is &quot;conservative, but not as controversial&quot; as Judge Bork. And Sen. Biden warned that if the president picks a nominee who holds Judge Bork's views, &quot;I believe he will not only have trouble, he will not have a nominee.&quot;    Among those mentioned prominently on the list, Judge Bowman, former dean of the law schools at Wake Forest in North Carolina and the University of Missouri in Kansas City, might be the most controversial.    Although described by former law school colleagues as mild-mannered, the 53-year-old Judge Bowman would spur strong opposition from organized labor. While at Wake Forest, he helped establish and later defended the Wake Institute for Labor Policy Analysis, viewed by others on the faculty and at the university as an anti-union research center.    Mr. Bowman left Wake Forest after the school's trustees severed ties to the institute. Former colleagues say he is quite conservative, with ties to Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.). They say he once criticized the &quot;plastic view of the Constitution,&quot; suggesting that he adheres to a &quot;strict constructionist&quot; view favored by conservatives. He was appointed by President Reagan in 1982 to the appeals court based in St. Louis.    Judge Kennedy, 51, was appointed to the San Francisco-based federal appeals court in 1976 by President Ford. He is a leading candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy, with strong backing from Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard, head of the Justice Department Civil Division, and from U.S. Appeals Court Judge Alex Kozinski of Pasadena, Calif., who has ties to Reagan administration conservatives. Both are former law clerks for Judge Kennedy. Some administration right-wingers, however, say Judge Kennedy may be too moderate.    Judge Silberman, 52, was a senior official in the Labor and Justice departments in the Nixon administration. He would face problems because of his strong criticism of affirmative action and his difficulties getting along with some court colleagues.    Judge Winter, 52, was a popular Yale Law School professor. He is a good friend of Judge Bork's, although he is seen as more moderate and compassionate. He is still personally close to liberal Justice Thurgood Marshall, for whom he clerked 25 years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
