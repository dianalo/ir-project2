There are two types of parallelisms in image processingtasks, which can be exploited for speed-up, i.e., image parallelism andfunction parallelism. In this study, the authors consider efficient waysto exploit image parallelism using the hypercube structure. Image parallelismhere means that the same operation is repeated on every pixel or regionthroughout an image frame so that the image may be partitioned into aset of subimages which can be processed concurrently by multiple processingelements (PEs). A pseudo binary tree, an efficient topology for distributingsubimages and combining local results, can be easily embedded in thehypercube. In the computational model, the subimages are loaded fromthe controller to the processing nodes in the hypercube, processed inparallel, and the local results are collected via the pseudo binary tree.The authors examine the efficiency of three different schemes in termsof speed-up for different numbers of PEs employed. The results obtainedin an implementation of median filtering on the iPSC are provided.</TEXT></DOC>
