Now, as if the abundance of choices were insufficient, ordinaryfolks are likely to be presented with still another decision in the1990s: They will be asked to decide between spending and saving.   It won't be easy after a 15-year addiction to the retailmarketplace, a period in which the subtle arts of marketing, alongwith plentiful credit and tax incentives, helped produce alive-for-now mentality.   Uncle Sam will be trying to break that habit in the 1990s, andthe government is preparing the first of its incentives, a FamilySavings Account that would allow $5,000 a year to be saved tax-free.   That's a big incentive, but one many Americans will finddifficult to exploit because, as envisioned, those savings wouldlose their tax exemption if not maintained for a decade, aneternity for those used to immediate gratification.   In this and other ways the Bush administration hopes toaccomplish two ends: Promote savings, which are necessary forindustrial development and job creation, and spur Americans to seekgreater financial rewards by investing for the long term.   The consequences are enormous for individuals, the generaleconomy and government.   For individuals, saving for the long term rather than immediatespending might provide the means to buy even more tomorrow.Investments grow; the value of purchases often falls.   Money saved generally means a sounder economy, since it isinvested in research and development of plant and equipment that inturn enhance productive efficiency _ more goods at lower cost _ andcreate jobs.   For government the return might not be immediate. In fact, taxexemptions can have the short-term effect of reducing revenues. Butover the longer term, a larger, healthier economy inevitably meansan increase in revenues.   Whether the goals can be accomplished is made uncertain by manyfactors. For one thing, the Family Savings Plan would involve a10-year period of time, an ambitious endeavor in a nationaccustomed to making tax changes each year.   Individual Retirement Accounts, for example, were originallymeant to spur savings by allowing $2,000 a year to be invested anddeducted from current tax liability. But after several years thedeductibility feature was removed.   That action, in the opinion of critics, all but emasculated anotherwise strong incentive to save rather than spend. It probablyleft a legacy of doubt about government promised that could impactthe Family Savings Plans.   However, some of the other tax changes in recent years have beenmore in line with the need to save rather than spend. Most consumerdebt, for example, no longer is tax deductible, thus removing atleast one incentive to spending.   Americans accepted that action with amazing calmness, eventhough it proved to be enormously costly to them. However, itdidn't stop them from taking on debt, and in that respect it failedto make a dent in the buy-now philosophy.   It leaves this question: If people feel so strongly about buyingthat they will pay higher taxes in order to continue buying, will aprogram that rewards them for savings instead of buying be any moresuccessful?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, Dec. 19.</NOTE></DOC>
