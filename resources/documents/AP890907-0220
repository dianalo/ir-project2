The base at Santa Lucia, 65 miles northwest of here, is part of amajor offensive by the Peruvian government against drug gangs andtheir allies _ dogmatic Maoist guerrillas who call themselves theShining Path and control much of the lush Upper Huallaga RiverValley on the eastern slopes of the Andes.   Despite the danger posed by the guerrilla force, the UnitedStates is making the campaign in Peru the centerpiece of its driveagainst cocaine trafficking in the Andean nations, which supply thecoca leaf from which the drug is refined. The plans were drawnbefore President Bush outlined his $7.9-billion drug program Sept. 5.   ``Sixty to 70 percent of the world's coca production comes out ofhere,'' said Craig Chretien, chief of the U.S. Drug EnforcementAgency's operations in Peru. ``Peru, of all the countries, offersthe best opportunity to do significant damage to the coca trade.''   Once the anti-drug base is completed in October, as many as 50Americans will operate directly from the Upper Huallaga region,providing training and air support to some 300 police rangersassigned to the garrison.   The Americans include DEA agents and contracted Vietnam Warveterans who fly and maintain the nine U.S. Bell helicopters and twoC-123 cargo planes currently on loan to Peru for the anti-drug fight.   ``The base is strategically located near all of the mostimportant trafficking areas,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate, chief ofPeru's drug police.   The compound will have a three-quarter-mile airstrip that canaccommodate C-130 cargo planes, three helicopter pads, and ninebuildings, mainly barracks. The 100-acre area will be enclosed bybarbed wire and the outlying perimeter will be protected by mines.   The step-up in the U.S. involvement comes as the Peruvian army,armed with recently acquired Soviet armored helicopters, haslaunched its heaviest campaign so far in the valley against theShining Path _ ``Sendero Luminoso'' in Spanish.   The escalation in the fighting in the valley, however, hasaroused the concern of the Andean Commission of Jurists, amongothers, that the United States could be drawn into the war againstthe guerrillas.   The commission, affliated with the Andean Pact alliance ofVenezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, noted recently thatwhile the base is intended for the drug fight, ``observers areconcerned that in the medium term it can be converted into aspringboard for the internationalization of the counterinsurgencyfight in Peru.''   The DEA agents came to Tingo Maria, about 250 miles northeast ofLima, Peru's capital, in search of cocaine traffickers. But theyhave found themselves in the middle of a revolution and working in avalley dominated by at least 2,500 guerrillas.   ``It's probably the most hostile situation the DEA works inanywhere,'' Chretien said in an interview in Lima.   Earlier this year the Shining Path offered a $50,000 reward forany DEA agent killed in the valley, according to the Rev. PaulFeeley, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, a town35 miles north of Tingo Maria.   ``The DEA has become a dirty word in the Huallaga Valley,'' hesaid. ``Sendero, and most other people around here, too, see the DEAas being anti-subversive, not just anti-drug.''   In return for providing protection from police raids, the ShiningPath enjoys the support of tens of thousands of peasants who growcoca in the valley, earning 10 times what they could from othercrops.   The guerrillas collect a 10 to 15 percent ``tax'' from thegrowers as well as charging Colombian traffickers $10,000 to $15,000for each small plane that picks up cocaine paste for refining inColombia, according to the peasants and police.   Houses along the Jungle Highway leading out of Tingo Maria, thelargest town in the valley, are scrawled in blood-red paint withdeadly messages for the DEA.   One on a school building said: ``Get out, Yankees, while you can_ you will find your tombs here.''   The DEA is not permitted to take part in counterinsurgency wars.But in practice that changed in Peru when it became clear two yearsago that the guerrillas were actively involved in the cocaine trade.   ``The rule is that Sendero is fair game if they're trafficking indrugs,'' Chretien said. ``What counts is if they're traffickers, nottheir politics. That doesn't mean we go looking for guerrilla campsor columns. But if we spot them from the air, we notify the police.And if they attack us, we defend ourselves.''   The DEA pulled out of this ramshackle settlement in a hurry inApril after a force of 200 rebels, aided by local drug gangs andColombian traffickers, overran a police post in Uchiza, a town a fewmiles from Santa Lucia, killing 10 policemen. Three of them wereofficers who were executed publicly in the town plaza after thegarrison ran out of ammunition.   ``Tingo Maria isn't a healthy place if you're an American,'' saida DEA agent. ``There's a Sendero committee on every block, everyblock.''   Tingo Maria, at the southern end of the narrow, 150-mile-longvalley, has the look of a town expecting an attack at any moment.Nervous troops behind sandbag barricades guard the bridge over theriver to the town's airstrip.   Villagers say the Shining Path now moves boldly through thevalley, in columns of up to 500 fighters. The rebels wear uniformsof black T-shirts and khaki pants, forsaking the clothing of thePeruvian peasantry that would allow them to fade into the civilianpopulace.   In response, the army has begun employing its Soviet helicopters,known as ``flying tanks'' and armed with heavy-caliber machine gunsand rockets. In July the armed forces reported killing 210 rebels,110 of them in three air and land battles over a two-day period inthe valley.   ``It's getting to the point where there are going to befull-scale battles between two strong forces,'' said Feeley, theCanadian priest.   Making use recently of four of the MI-25 helicopters, the armystrafed guerrilla columns and at least one village of peasantsconsidered to be Shining Path supporters.   Human rights groups fear that the casualty tolls provided by thearmy may include many civilians.   Feeley said that 17 suspected Shining Path leaders detained bythe army in late July in Aucayacu ``are now on that long list ofdisappeared people.''   But the guerrillas have taken their own toll.   In June three Shining Path assassins walked into the office ofTingo Maria's popular mayor, Manuel Espinosa, and shot him to deathas he sat behind his desk.   In Aucayacu, the Shining Path has assassinated four of the lastsix mayors.   ``The other two quit before they were killed,'' said Feeley.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Sept. 10</NOTE></DOC>
