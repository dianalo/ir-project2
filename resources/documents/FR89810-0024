Hawkins-RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988(Pub. L. 100-297), reauthorizes the mathematics and science education program.The new Act (the Dwight D. Eisenhower Mathematics and Science EducationAct) revises several of the provisions of the predecessor statute (TitleII of the Education for Economic Security Act). However, the purpose ofthe program is still to improve the skills of teachers and the qualityof instruction in mathematics and science.The following regulations implement the changes required by Pub. L. 100-297.On December 6, 1988, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this program in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 49280).The NPRM included a discussion of major changes and issues. In additionto clarifying changes mandated by the statute, this discussion includeda statement of the Secretary's policy, in situations where the State educationalagency (SEA) determines that a local educational agency (LEA) has not madeadequate progress in implementing its program, to permit the SEA eitherto approve appropriate revisions in the LEA's application or, after providingthe LEA an opportunity for a hearing, to disapprove the LEA's application.In addition, the discussion proposed an explanation of the expanded definitionof retraining in the higher education program as well as some specificsof the required agreement between institutions of higher education (IHEs)and LEAs. Finally, it explained briefly that the regulations that wouldgovern a bypass for a grantee's failure to provide for the participationof children or teachers from private nonprofit schools were those proposedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 18, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, the Department receiveda number of written comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis ofthe substantive comments is published as an appendix to these final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact</ITAG>In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulationswould require transmission of information that is being gathered by oris available from any other agency or authority of the United States.Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 208</ITAG>Colleges and universities, Consortium, Economically disadvantaged, Education,Elementary and secondary education, Gifted and talented, Grants administration,Grant programs_education, Inservice education, Low-income families, Mathematics,Museums, Nonprofit educational organization, Other appropriate educationalpersonnel, Preservice education, Private schools, Recruitment and retention,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Retraining, Science and technology,State administered programs, Students, Teachers, Training program, Underservedand underrepresented, Vocational education.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 84.164, The DwightD.

One commenter inquired whetherthose administrative costs include indirect costs and salaries of the projectdirector, coordinator or consultant, or teacher released to provide program-relatedtechnical assistance. Another commenter was unsure whether LEA activitiesallowed under section 2006(b) of the statute (and andSection; 208.23(a) ofthe regulations) were themselves technical assistance training activitiesthat should be treated as LEA administrative costs. Still another commenterrecommended that the five percent limitation on an LEA's allowable administrativecosts not include indirect costs it could claim through application ofan established indirect cost rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The five percent limitation on an LEA's administrativecosts includes only charges attributable to program administration. Administrativecosts include, as they do under section 1521 of the statute for the Chapter2 program, planning and processing of funds and monitoring and evaluationof program activities. Therefore, to the extent that persons paid withprogram funds perform work directly related to program implementation orsupervision of project activities, their salaries can be considered programcosts rather than administrative costs. This is so regardless of the activity,under andSection; 208.23(a), the LEA is implementing. Moreover, while thatsection and section 2006(d) of the statute limit to five percent the combinedSEA level expenditures for technical assistance and administrative costs,so-called ``technical assistance'' activities at the LEA level are notsubject to the LEA's five percent limit on administrative costs unlessthey reasonably must be considered, on their own, as administrative costs.The fact that one might characterize project activities as ``technicalassistance'' or ``on-site training'' does not make the charge an administrativecost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indirect costs, which LEAs may charge to program funds through applicationof an indirect cost rate, are a form of administrative cost that cannotreadily be identified as relating to a single cost objective or function.Therefore, the Secretary has concluded that an LEA's indirect costs mustbe subsumed within the five percent limitation on its charges for localadministration of the program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested clarification of the phrase ``instructionalmaterials'' as used in andSection; 208.23(a)(5), and asked whether it includesequipment as well as supplies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Instructional materials may include any teaching equipmentand supplies, if, within the design of an approved project for an individualteacher, the equipment and supplies are essential and their purchase isallowable under EDGAR.

Commentersclaimed that the statute is ambiguous as to whether cooperative programsmust be funded competitively since the requirements in section 2007(b)(1)(B)of the statute that grants to IHEs be awarded competitively need not relateto funds used to support cooperative programs funded under section 2007(c).The commenters viewed the statute as eliminating the previous statutoryrequirements that at least 20 percent of higher education program fundssupport cooperative programs, while retaining the option that SAHEs awardcooperative grants without formal competition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the commenters recommended that the Secretary continueto provide SAHEs the discretion to develop, plan, and fund cooperativeprograms on a non-competitive basis, a process that several commentersagreed had resulted in very successful projects. This, they claimed, willensure that cooperative programs meet identified State needs, such as thosein rural areas, and that SAHEs retain their leadership role in promotingthe most effective programs in mathematics and science education. One commenteralso stated that if cooperative programs must be awarded competitively,the limitation in section 2007(d) of the statute on the amount of fundsavailable to SAHEs for administrative costs will provide insufficient financialsupport for planning and developing appropriate cooperative programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> While the Secretary understands these concerns, hecontinues to believe that the statute requires cooperative programs tobe funded on a competitive basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 2007(c), which describes cooperative programs, referencesthe funds to be awarded as grants to IHEs under section 2007(b)(1)(A).Section 2007(b)(1)(A) states that not less than 95 percent of funds availableshall be used by the SAHE ``for grants to (IHEs) in accordance with theprovisions of this subsection'' (meaning section 2007(b)). Section 2007(b)(1)(B),which is a part of ``this subsection,'' states, among other things, thatthe SAHE shall make funds available on a competitive basis to IHEs thatapply for funds and that demonstrate the involvement of LEAs. Consequently,the Secretary interprets section 2007(c) of the statute to require thatSAHEs fund cooperative programs on a competitive basis as grants to IHEs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This interpretation is supported by the Conference Committee Reportaccompanying the statute, which states that of the funds reserved for highereducation activities: ``Up to five percent may be used for State assessmentand administration and not less than 95 percent must be used for grantsto (IHEs) for training programs conducted in conjunction with LEAs.'' SeeH. Rep. 100-567, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 354, para. 17. As the requirementthat grants be awarded for training purposes conducted in conjunction withLEAs is itself part of section 2007(b)(1)(B), the requirements governingall funds provided under section 2007(b)(1)(A) appear to be those in section2007(b)(1)(B). As noted above, this includes the requirement that grantsbe issued to IHEs on a competitive basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the Secretary cannot alter the amount of funds that section2007(d) permits SAHEs to retain for their administrative costs, the requirementof competitive award-making should not significantly impair a SAHE's abilityto fund cooperative programs, even non-traditional programs, that it believesare important. The statute, for example, does not limit a SAHE's authorityto develop the specific content of projects it wants funded on a cooperativebasis and to solicit corresponding applications from IHEs. Nor does iteither preclude SAHEs from reserving a portion of funds available undersection 2007(b) for cooperative programs, or impose selection criteriafor awards to successful applicants. The statute requires only that SEAsuse a process of awarding grants that does not pre-select the recipientsof grants to operate cooperative programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 208.33 Use of Funds by IHEs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether IHEs may use funds underthis section to train administrators and other non-teaching support personnelso that they understand the scope of the issues and improvements in mathematicsand science programs in the State.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations, like the underlying provision insection 2007(b) of the statute, authorizes training only for teachers unless,under andSection; 208.33(a)(3) (section 2007(b)(2)(C) of the statute), inservicetraining is needed to permit other school personnel to improve their mathematicsand science teaching skills.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter felt the proposed regulations should beamended to recognize the special needs of rural schools for teachers withmulticertifications (i.e., in a number of subjects).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The provisions of andSection; 208.33 permit IHEs touse funds to provide training for teachers to obtain multicertificationsin mathematics and science. Moreover, like the statute, the regulationsemphasize the State's responsibility to meet the needs of its rural population.For example, under andSection; 208.11(b)(vii), the State's application mustinclude an assurance that the needs of the rural population will be consideredin the SEA's and SAHE's use of funds reserved for State use. In addition,to the extent that the State determines that its rural population is ``historicallyunderserved,'' the SEA may use Demonstration and Exemplary Program fundsto concentrate on rural demonstration and exemplary programs under andSection;208.24(a)(1)(iii). Similarly, to the extent that the rural population isconsidered historically underserved, under andSection; 208.33(c)(1) an IHEmight be required to take the special needs of a rural population intoaccount in the activities it supports with program funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters strongly supported the proposed expandeddefinition of allowable ``retraining'' services in andSection; 208.33(a)(2)(ii),which would expressly permit funds to be used to expand teachers' areasof specialization within their existing disciplines. However, two commentersbelieved that the proposed provision would weaken and confuse the purposeof section 2007(b)(2)(B) of the statute, which the commenters felt is toincrease the numbers of mathematics and science teachers. These lattercommenters also believed the expanded definition is duplicative of the``inservice training'' services authorized by section 2007(b)(2)(C) ofthe statute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that the principal purpose ofsection 2007(b)(2)(B) is to increase the number of qualified mathematicsand science teachers. However, not all States appear to view intradisciplinaryretraining as an allowable form of ``inservice'' training. In those thatdo not, the question of whether program funds could be used to retrainthose already teaching mathematics or science appears to create significantuncertainty. Because the Secretary views intradisciplinary and interdisciplinarytraining to be equally within the purpose of the statute, the Secretaryproposed andSection; 208.33(a)(2)(ii).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, national research studies, including the Department of Education's``Summary Report of Title II State Needs Assessments'', ``A Study of CertifiedTeacher Availability in the States'' by Joanne Capper for the Council ofChief State School Officers, and National Science Teachers Associationstudies of training within the science fields, indicate that one of themajor retraining needs is the retraining of science teachers who are teachingcourses within science other than those for which they were specificallyprepared. Indeed, Capper has reported that ``15,127 teachers of mathematics,science and foreign languages are teaching out-of-field, and that 500,000students in the 29 states surveyed are being taught by teachers who arenot fully certified to teach their subjects.'' According to the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science report Project 2061, ``Few elementaryschool teachers have even a rudimentary education in science and math andmany junior and senior high school teachers of science and mathematicsdo not meet reasonable standards of preparation in those fields.'' Thusthe regulation enhances the flexibility States have in meeting their mosturgent needs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested the data source for the statementin the NPRM (53 FR 49280), ``because the greatest need for retraining isintradisciplinary''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Upon further review, the phrase ``greatest need''may have been an overstatement. However, several reports from professionalassociations, including those mentioned in response to the preceding comment,the staff experience of Title II, and the needs expressed by a number ofStates, have confirmed that intradisciplinary retraining is a major needin science and mathematics education. Therefore, the Secretary has determinedthat these regulations should permit the expenditure of program funds onintradisciplinary retraining.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stressed that for rural areas, meaningfulagreements between IHEs and consortia of LEAs will not be feasible unlessthe SAHE makes funds available to administer and operate the consortia.The commenter observed that small schools have difficulty attracting andretaining teachers of quality, and the IHEs lack funds to operate the consortia.The commenter recommended either that some administrative funds be madeavailable to IHEs that form and coordinate consortia of rural schools,or that the consortia receive additional funding for their administrativecosts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The statute provides ways of defraying administrativecosts of IHEs that coordinate consortia of rural schools. If an IHE's activitiesare funded by a subgrant or subcontract from a number of LEAs, the IHEcould incur administrative costs provided that the total amount of administrativecosts the LEAs and the IHE incur does not exceed the five percent limitationin section 2006(b)(4) of the statutes. If the IHE's activities are fundedby a competitive grant from the SAHE, its administrative costs would besubject to the SAHE approved budget and applicable provisions of EDGAR.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters strongly supported proposed andSection;208.33(d)(2), which would require that applications to SAHEs from IHEsprovide evidence of both (1) cooperative planning with the affected LEAs,and (2) that the funded activities reflect the training, retraining, andinservice training needs of teachers as jointly determined by the affectedLEAs and IHEs. Two other commenters objected to the provision on the groundthat it would impose requirements that lack a statutory basis. The commentersbelieved that the proposed regulation will not rectify the perceived problemof IHEs offering programs ill-suited to LEA needs. Moreover, given thevariety of subjects that IHE applications must address, the commentersstated that the proposed regulation places too much emphasis on IHE-LEAcollaboration in program planning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 2007(b)(3) of the statute states that to receivea grant, an IHE must enter into an agreement with an LEA, or consortiumof LEAs, to provide inservice training and retraining for teachers in thepublic and private schools. Furthermore, section 2007(b)(1)(B) of the statuterequires an IHE's application for funds to demonstrate the involvementof LEAs. The Secretary has concluded that an IHE cannot reasonably meetthese responsibilities unless it has worked with the respective LEAs inidentifying the needs for training or retraining among the teachers workingwithin the affected school districts. Therefore, the Secretary concludesthat the provisions of andSection; 208.33(d)(2) are reasonable and consistentwith those statutory requirements. Moreover, because maximum impact atthe school level from such training generally occurs when school personnelare continually and fully involved in the improvement process, the Secretaryalso believes that the elements of an agreement listed in andSection; 208.33(b)(2)are necessary for adequate program management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 208.51 Participation of Children and Teachers in Private Schools</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the use of the words ``sufficient''in proposed andSection; 208.51(b), which would have required that LEAs make``sufficient provision for teacher training, retraining, and inservicetraining for the benefit of private nonprofit school teachers * * *.''The commenter stressed that the word is vague and that it is not used inthe statute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees with the commenter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>The word ``sufficient'' has been deleted from andSection;208.51(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18725 Filed 8-9-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
