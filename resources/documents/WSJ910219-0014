The new fiscal plan is being drafted at a time when thecountry is showing signs of a deepening recession. Theunemployment rate has reached 9.7% of the work force andretail sales have declined for four consecutive months.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Wilson told reporters that the new budget, which willinclude the government's revenue and spending projections forfiscal 1992 starting April 1, is &quot;the most difficult&quot; he hashad to prepare since being named finance minister in 1984.   &quot;We have to put together a good package of policies thatrespond to the challenges that the country is facing today,the principal one being the weakness in the economy,&quot; hesaid.   The government has little scope to increase spendingbecause of its heavy debt burden. The federal debt hasreached more than 385 billion Canadian dollars (US$334billion), or 57% of the country's gross national product.   &quot;With the deficit as high as it is, Mr. Wilson can'tintroduce new spending programs,&quot; said George Saba, chiefeconomist at Montreal Trust Co. Such programs &quot;simply won'twash.&quot;   Three of Canada's major business organizations havejointly urged a two-year freeze on federal program spending.The three are the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, CanadianManufacturers' Association and the Business Council onNational Issues, which represents 150 chief executives ofmajor companies.   Mr. Saba said the government will get some fiscal relieffrom declining interest rates, which will reduce thegovernment's big debt-service costs. Public-debt chargescurrently account for almost a third of budget spending.   Short-term Canadian interest rates have declined 3 3/4percentage points since last May, and Canadian analysts arepredicting the decline will continue in coming months becauseof the weak economy.   Most of Canada's major commercial banks yesterdayannounced cuts in their prime lending rates to 11.25% from11.75%, effective today. The prime rate is the base levy forvarious lending charges. It was the third cut this year inthe banks' prime lending rates.   John Parish, assistant chief economist at the Bank ofMontreal, predicted that declining interest rates will give a&quot;significant boost&quot; to the economy. He said he looks for therecovery to start after the second quarter of this year. Theeconomy slipped into its current recession in the April-Juneperiod last year.   Gerard MacDonell, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said,&quot;Steadily weakening Canadian economic conditions and a strongCanadian dollar have convinced {financial} markets thatshort-term interest rates are on a sustained downtrend.&quot; TheCanadian dollar closed in Toronto yesterday at 86.72 U.S.cents, up from 86.60 cents a week earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
