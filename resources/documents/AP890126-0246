The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, itemsexpected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted$130.85 billion in December.   The 6.4 percent jump was the biggest since an 8.7 percentincrease recorded last June. It reflected widespread demand in bothcivilian and military categories.   The December orders figure closed out the year on a strong note,with orders for the last 12 months totaling $1.43 trillion, a 10.8percent increase from 1987.   It was the best showing since a 12.3 percent increase in 1984.Orders had edged up a slight 1.2 percent in 1985 and 0.4 percent in1986, two years in which American busineses were losing domestic andoverseas sales to foreign manufacturers.   American manufacturing enjoyed a rebound in 1987 and 1988 as adecline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies madeU.S. products competitive once again on overseas markets.   Orders in the volatile military category, influenced by when biggovernment contracts are signed, jumped 21.1 percent in December toa seasonally adjusted $10.16 billion following a 21.5 percentdecrease in November.   But even excluding defense, orders for durable goods were up 5.4percent during the month.   Orders for non-defense capital goods shot up as well, rising 7.8percent to $38.6 billion last month. The category is closely watchedfor signals of business intentions to expand and modernize.   December's increase in demand for non-defense capital goods wasthe biggest since a 12.5 percent jump in June.   In another volatile category, transportation orders increased 20percent in December to $38.9 billion after a 7.2 percent decrease amonth earlier.   The strength in transportation included large gains in the auto,aircraft and shipbuilding industries.   Excluding transportation, the December increase in orders fordurable goods was 1.6 percent.   In other industries, orders for primary metals rose 5.3 percentto $13.3 billion, demand for electrical machinery was up 1.1 percentto $20.3 billion, while orders for non-electrical machinery dropped3.2 percent to $20.7 billion. Most of the decline in thenon-electrical category was in engines and turbines.
