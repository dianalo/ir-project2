Background on the Indiana Program</ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Indiana programeffective July 29, 1982. Information pertinent to the general backgroundon the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the dispositionof comments, and a detailed explanation of conditions of approval of theIndiana program can be found in the July 26, 1982 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and proposed amendments are identified at 30CFR 914.10, 914.15 and 914.16.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Submission of Amendment </ITAG>By letter dated June 12, 1989 (Administrative Record No. IND-0649), theIndiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) submitted proposed amendmentsto the Indiana program at 310 Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) IAC 23-1-3and 310 IAC 12-2-7. The proposed changes are briefly summarized below:The amendment to 310 IAC 12-1-3 changes the definition of ``cemetery''from ``any land dedicated to and used for the interment of human remainspursuant to the Indiana General Cemetery Act (IC 23-14-1-1)'' to ``anyarea of land where human remains are interred.'' This revision is madein response to an OSM notification to the State dated June 9, 1987, specifyingthe need to change the State's definition of ``cemetery.'' The amendment to 310 IAC 12-2-7 changes from forty-five (45) to thirty(30) the number of days the State is allowed for determining the completenessof a lands unsuitable petition. This amendment is intended to bring theIndiana rule into conformance with the counterpart Federal regulation.Other changes to 310 IAC 12-2-7 are stylistic or involve the correctionof typographical errors.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings</ITAG>Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR732.17, are the directors's findings concerning the proposed amendment.Only those revisions of particular interest are discussed below. Any revisionsnot revisions not specifically discussed below are found to be no lessstringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.Revisions which are not discussed below concern nonsubstantive wordingchanges or revise cross-reference and paragraph notations to reflect organizationalchanges.1. 310 IAC 12-1-3 DefinitionsIndiana proposes to revise the definition of ``cemetery'' from ``any landdedicated to and used for the interment of human remains pursuant to theIndiana General Cemetery Act (IC 23-14-1-1)'' to ``any area of land wherehuman remains are interred.''On February 10, 1987, OSMRE, promulgated revised regulations concerningthe consideration which must be accorded historic properties during thepermitting of surface coal mining operations (52 FR 4244-4263). These rulesrespond to the decisions rendered by the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia in <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation II </T3>(CivilAction No. 79-1144), facilitate implementation of OSMRE's responsibilitiesunder the National Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, and clarifythe responsibilities of OSMRE, State regulatory authorities and applicantsfor permits to conduct surface coal mining operations and coal exploration.In keeping with the July 15, 1985, decision in <T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>OSMRE revised the definition of cemeteryat 30 CFR 761.5 to include ``any area of land where human bodies are interred.''The previous definition excluded private family burial grounds.The current Indiana regulations at 310 IAC 12-1-3 define a cemetery asbeing ``and land dedicated to and used for the interment of human remainspursuant to the Indiana General Cemetery Act.'' Several commenters on theproposed Federal definition stated that the definition of cemetery shouldinclude the concepts of dedication or recognition of lands specificallyset aside for a cemetery. However, as discussed in the preamble to theFederal definition as finally promulgated (52 FR 4254, February 10, 1987),OSMRE did not adopt these comments because they improperly limit the Congressionalintent to protect human remains from disturbance by surface coal miningoperations. Also, any such definition would require the regulatory authorityto make a judgment, often in the absence of any relevant information, concerningthe intent of the individual who originally interred the remains.The Federal rules at 30 CFR 732.17(d) require that OSMRE notify State regulatoryauthorities of all changes in Federal regulations which will necessitateState program changes. OSMRE informed Indiana on June 9, 1987, that theState needed to revise its definition of cemetery or otherwise amend itsprogram to be no less effective than the revised Federal definition. Theproposed amendment to the definition of cemetery is intended to addressthis concern. The Director finds that the proposed definition of ``cemetery''is no less stringent than SMCRA and is identical to and no less effectivethan the counterpart Federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5.2. 310 IAC 12-2-7 EM Lands Unsuitable PetitionsIndiana has amended the language of its approved regulations at 2310 IAC12-2-7 concerning initial processing, recordkeeping and notification oflands unsuitable petitions. Specifically, at 310 IAC 12-2-7(a)(1) Indianahas changed from forty-five days to thirty days the number of days theState is allowed for determining the completeness of a lands unsuitablepetition. The counterpart Federal regulation at 30 CFR 764.15(a)(1) alsorequires that such a determination be made within thirty days. The proposedamendment, therefore, is no less stringent than SMCRA and is no less effectivethan the Federal rules. Also included in the Indiana rule 310 IAC 12-2-7(a)(1)is language which states that ``for good cause the director may extendthe time for making these determinations for an additional fifteen (15)days.'' While this provision is part of the approved Indiana program andis not being amended here, OSM will, through its normal oversight of theIndiana program, monitor Indiana's use of the 15-day provision to assurethat it is not abused. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>Public CommentsThe public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing announcedin the July 24, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>ended on August 23, 1989. No public commentswere received and the scheduled public hearing was not held as no one requestedan opportunity to provide testimony. Agency Comments Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were also solicited from various Federalagencies with an actual or potential interest in the Indiana program. Nosubstantive comments were received.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision </ITAG>Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the Indiana programas submitted by Indiana on June 12, 1989. The Federal regulations at 30CFR part 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are beingamended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effectiveimmediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encouragestates to bring their programs in conformity with the Federal standardswithout undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is requiredby SMCRA. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations </ITAG>National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, prusuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis and regulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State. Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 914</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Carl C.
