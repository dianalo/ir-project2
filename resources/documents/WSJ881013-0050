Seib and Michel McQueen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   The stakes are higher, and the tactical decisions tougher, for Michael Dukakis than for George Bush as the two presidential candidates prepare for their final debate tonight.    Mr. Dukakis, the Democrat, must choose between seemingly contradictory missions in the nationally televised session, supporters of the two candidates agree.    As the candidate lagging in the polls, Mr. Dukakis will want to attack Mr. Bush because the debate represents the Massachusetts governor's last chance to use a head-to-head encounter to draw even. But Mr. Dukakis also needs to make voters warm to his reserved style and occasionally aloof personality. Strident attacks risk turning off voters, who already have slightly higher negative impressions of Mr. Dukakis than they do of Mr. Bush.    Some allies think Mr. Dukakis at least has to attempt the tough task of being both aggressive and likable at the same time. &quot;I think he has to be aggressive&quot; by directly attacking Mr. Bush across the debate stage, says Democratic consultant Mark Siegel. &quot;When he's looking into the camera that should be a different Michael Dukakis. That should be the warm and compassionate Michael Dukakis.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis is likely to stress Mr. Bush's &quot;failed missions&quot; -- assignments the Republican nominee allegedly bungled as vice president. Aides are divided over whether Mr. Dukakis also should look for a dramatic ploy to seize attention during the debate, or pursue the more low-key, steady style that has been his trademark so far.    For his part, Vice President Bush has a seemingly simpler task.    His aides say he will try to steer the debate toward the familiar campaign themes -- law and order, the Massachusetts prison furlough program and opposition to higher taxes -- that the Bush camp is convinced have enabled it to score heavily in recent weeks. And he is likely to come armed with more of the biting one-liners that media adviser Roger Ailes provides as a way of attacking Mr. Dukakis.    The vice president also is likely to look for ways to turn the discussion more to defense and national security -- areas Mr. Bush perceives as his strong suits but that his aides think got short shrift in the first presidential debate. And aides preparing Mr. Bush for the debate over the last few weeks have been preparing him to handle some dramatic maneuver by Mr. Dukakis to seize the spotlight or break out of the stylized format of the debate.    But Bush aides maintain that, regardless of tactics or debating skills of the candidates, the vice president enjoyed the advantage in the first debate of being seen as more likable. &quot;The biggest problem Mike Dukakis has, in addition to controlling the agenda, is reshaping his personality,&quot; says Mark Goodin, a Bush campaign spokesman.    The Dukakis camp insists that it enters the debate on an upswing begun by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen's widely acclaimed performance in the vice presidential debate with Republican Dan Quayle. &quot;We go into it after Quayle's poor performance last week, which really only raises the bar for Bush,&quot; says Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan. But others acknowledge that the debate will be important in determining whether voters will believe in their candidate. &quot;At first, they were sizing him up,&quot; says Rep. Tony Coelho (D., Calif.), who has been helping Mr. Dukakis prepare. &quot;Now, they're deciding.&quot;    New polls indicate that Mr. Bush enters the debate in a slight lead, even though earlier surveys showed that voters generally thought his running mate, Sen. Quayle, was outperformed in his debate with Sen. Bentsen. An ABC News-Washington Post poll indicates that Mr. Bush leads Mr. Dukakis by 50% to 47%, a Gallup poll shows Mr. Bush in the lead 49% to 43%, and a Harris poll gives the vice president a 50%-to-48% lead.    The debate tonight, like the earlier ones, will be led by a panel of journalists who will question the candidates. One potential source of controversy was eliminated when CBS News anchorman Dan Rather announced that he had declined an invitation from a bipartisan debate-organizing commission to be a panelist. Earlier this year, Mr. Rather became a subject of a widely publicized campaign fracas when he argued heatedly with Mr. Bush during a live interview that focused on Mr. Bush's role in the Iran-Contra scandal. </TEXT></DOC>
