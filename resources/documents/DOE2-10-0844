<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0844 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using time resolved pulse and probe spectroscopy, the transmission modulationof CdSe platelets is investigated under excitation and generation ofa dense electron-hole plasma. Induced absorption is related to excitonscreening, band-gap renormalisation, and energy relaxation in a highdensity electron-hole plasma. These investigations exhibit also interestfrom the point of view of optical signal processing because an all-opticalpicosecond inverter gate and more generally a many input NOR gate canbe built based on the induced absorption which occurs in the presenceof a dense electron-hole plasma. The operation of such device is describedand discussed in relation with the possible development of optical coprocessors(compatible with a parallel processing of data) and especially in relationwith the critical problem of associating and cascading optical NOR gates.A first step is reported toward cascadable picosecond NOR gates by demonstratingthe possible operation of an all-optical inverter gate which uses anintermediate frequency doubling of the output signal. This implies thata cascadable all-optical NOR gate operating in an effective one-wavelengthmode is possible. Experiments are carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature.The operation wavelength is around 673 nm in CdSe. The switching energyof the NOR gate is 30 {mu}J/cm/sup 2/ per pulse at 337 nm.</TEXT></DOC>
