If the effort succeeds, it could offer opportunities in the region for the next U.S. administration.    Many of the home-grown leaders of the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza are increasingly frustrated with PLO chief Yasser Arafat's inability to articulate a clear political strategy. Mr. Arafat keeps his organization together -- and has survived for two decades -- by avoiding specific commitments. But now, the nine-month-old uprising, along with the political vacuum created in July when King Hussein relinquished Jordan's claim to the Israeli-occupied territories, may force Mr. Arafat's hand.    &quot;The center of gravity of the movement is shifting away from those who live in exile {such as Mr. Arafat} and toward resident Palestinians,&quot; says Helena Cobban, an expert on Palestinians and a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. &quot; Palestinians realize that vague, obfuscating language won't be helpful to them right now.&quot;    Against this backdrop, the PLO begins a diplomatic offensive tomorrow when Mr. Arafat addresses what should be a friendly audience, the European Parliament, in France. He is expected to avoid specifics in his speech. Later this month, the PLO also will push an anti-Israel campaign at the United Nations General Assembly with calls for condemnation of Israel's deportation of Palestinians and perhaps an effort to win recognition of a Palestinian &quot;government in exile.&quot; Mr. Arafat also may try to address the General Assembly, perhaps in November.    But the real test of whether the PLO has serious diplomatic intentions comes this fall when it plans to convene its parliament in exile, the Palestine National Council. The PNC may declare a government in exile or a provisional government, but PLO officials in Washington say the centerpiece of the proposal emerging from the session will be U.N. resolution 181, the original 1947 plan to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The key question will be what other elements the PNC formula combines with resolution 181. Some experts expect references to other U.N. resolutions that call for territorial compromise based on Israel's border before it occupied the territories in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.    Palestinians say such a formulation would contain implicit diplomatic recognition of Israel and limit the boundaries of any Palestinian entity to the West Bank and Gaza.    Yet in the short run, it is unlikely the PNC's decisions will move peace any closer. A State Department official dismisses Resolution 181 as &quot;a total nonstarter,&quot; and says neither the administration nor Israel would accept it as a basis for negotiations.    Indeed, pro-Israel observers say such a formulation is a PLO trap. They note that the resolution divides Tel Aviv by including Jaffa in the Palestinian state, severs most of the Galilee from Israel and makes Jerusalem an international city. They contend that rather than being a starting point, Resolution 181 sets the debate back 40 years and would force Israel to defend its right to claim these areas.    Other experts say such a formula may be aimed at the next U.S. administration. National elections in the U.S. and Israel mean political gridlock for awhile. But recent trial balloons floated by moderate Palestinians, one expert says, are meant to show a more pragmatic face and suggest that with some support from the U.S. a deal can be worked out.    In the past, Mr. Arafat has gone to the brink of peace negotiations and then, pressured by Palestinian hard-liners, backed away. He might do so again to maintain unity in his movement.    But the ability of Palestinians in the occupied territories to sustain the uprising in the face of massive Israeli military pressure has altered the equation. These Palestinians don't want to undercut the PLO, but they expect more leadership than they are getting. To stay at the head of his own parade, Mr. Arafat needs to move. If he doesn't, says one expert here, the spontaneity that sparked and sustains the uprising may some day prompt West Bank and Gaza Palestinians to sit down on their own to negotiate with Israel. </TEXT></DOC>
