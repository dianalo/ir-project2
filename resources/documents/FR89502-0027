Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the AgriculturalMarketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such actionwould provide greater assurance that handlers will not engage in uneconomicmovement of the market's reserve milk supplies in qualifying such milkfor pricing status under the order. The action would also tend to ensurethat dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the orderand thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule underthe criteria contained therein.Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the AgriculturalMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and theprovisions of andSection; 1139.7(e) of the order, the revision of certainprovisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Great Basinmarketing area is being considered.All persons who desire to submit written data, views or arguments aboutthe proposed revision should send two copies of their views to the USDA/AMS/DairyDivision, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. BOx96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, by the 15th day after publication ofthis notice in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made availablefor public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours(7 CFR 1.27(b)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Consideration</ITAG>The provisions proposed to be revised are the shipping requirements setforth in andSection; 1139.7(d). The revision would be effective beginningwith the month of June 1989. The specific revision would reduce the shippingrequirement percentages by 5 percentage points, from the present 45 percentto 40 percent.Section 1139.7(e) of the Great Basin milk order allows the Director ofthe Dairy Division to increase or reduce the shipping percentage requirementby up to 10 percentage points to assure orderly marketing and efficienthandling of milk in the marketing area.Western Dairymen Cooperartive, Inc. (WDCI), a cooperative association whichrepresents a majority of the producers supplying the Great Basin market,requested that the percentage of producer milk required to be shipped topool distributing plants from a plant owned and operated by a cooperativeassociation and located in the marketing area be reduced 5 percentage points.The cooperative states that loss of sales and increasing production makenecessary a reduction of the required level of shipments of producer milkby a cooperative-owned and -operated manufacturing plant to pool distributingplants from 45 percent of producer milk to 40 percent in order to maintainthe pool status of its member producers who have long been associated withthe marketing area.Therefore, it may be appropriate to relax the aforementioned provisionsof andSection; 1139.7(d) to prevent uneconomic shipments of milk.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1139</ITAG>Milk marketing orders, Milk, Dairy products.The authority citation for 7 CFR Part 1139 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> (Secs. 1-19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601-674).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, on: April 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">W.H.
