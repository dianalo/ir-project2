The oil giant's Mobil Chemical Co. unit annually manufacturesover 5 billion of the 23 billion bags used by the nation's grocerystores. Mobil said it will recycle the bags into plastic sacks andother products made of polyethylene, such as plastic garbage cans.   The first stores to participate in the program will be 244Safeway markets in California, Nevada and Hawaii, which will begincollecting bags sometime next month, said Greg Auth, businessmanager of Mobil's grocery bags.   Other chains are expected to join in as consumer concern overthe environment continues to mount.   Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, and SonocoProducts Co. manufacture more than half of the nation's plasticgrocery bags. Sonoco said it collects bags from 1,500 supermarketsaround the country. The bags are then sold to a separate companyfor use in plastic tubing.   Mobil Chemical spokesman John Lord said the compnay will beginmaking presentations ``to all our customers'' in the coming weeks.``We expect strong suport from supermarket chains across country,''he said.   The use of plastic grocery bags has mushroomed in less than adecade. In 1982, just 5 percent of all grocery sacks were made ofplastic; today the figure is roughly 60 percent as more and moresupermarkets and shopkeepers opt for plastic bags, which areinexpensive, strong and take up one-tenth the space of theirbrown-paper counterparts.   Lord said legislation pending in a number of municipalities thatwould ban the use of plastic bags contributed to Mobil's move toset up the program even though ``plastic grocery sacks contributevery small volumes to the total waste stream.''   The key to the program's success will be consumer participation.Not only must consumers bring used bags to the supermarkets, butthe bags must be clean, Auth said. Dirty bags cannot be recycled aseasily, and it is time consuming to remove them from recycling bins.   The bags will be recycled at four Mobil plants that handlepolyethylene products. The company said its researchers ``arestepping up efforts to develop products that can contain greateramounts of recycled materials.''</TEXT></DOC>
