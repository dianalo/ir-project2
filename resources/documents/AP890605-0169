General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. saidthey sold vehicles at a daily rate of 47,359 during from May 21-31,compared with a daily rate of 50,181 in the same 1988 period.   Car sales were down 4.2 percent and truck sales were off 7.9percent.   The 10-day period last year was one of the strongest of 1988,which proved to be the second-best sales year in automobile history.   Through the first five months of this year, the car- andtruck-selling pace is lagging 5.3 percent behind the rate lastyear, with cars running 7.4 percent behind last year's rate andtrucks off by 1.6 percent.   Typically, April and May are among the hottest selling times inthe automobile industry, as Americans prepare for summer vacationsand weekend road trips.   Sales through March of this year ran below expectations,resulting in larger-than-anticipated inventories. The Big Threeoffered incentive packages in early April that boosted cashrebates, lowered finance rates and extended the deal to more models.   The strategy appears to have worked somewhat.   Combined April and May car and truck sales by the Big Threeautomakers ran 0.7 percent ahead of vehicle sales during those twomonths last year. This year's daily sales rate was 38,944 vehiclesin April and May, compared with a rate of 38,654 last year.   But inventories remained swollen, and companies have beentemporarily idling plants to reduce them. Speculation has continuedthat summer shutdowns, during which factories are retooled for nextyear's models, may be longer than normal.   Ford sustained the largest decline in car sales among the BigThree in late May. Its cars sold at daily rate of 9,121 during,down 8.4 percent from 9,956 last year. Light trucks made by Fordsold at a rate 2 percent below last year.   GM said late-May car sales were 16,400 a day this year, down 3.1percent from the 16,927 rate during the period last year. Lighttruck sales during the period fell 16.5 percent.   Chrysler posted a modest 0.7 percent gain in car sales with adaily rate of 4,439, compared with 4,407 last year. Chrysler'slate-May truck sales were up 0.3 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
