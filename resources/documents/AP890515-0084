The court unanimously reinstated a Charlotte, N.C., man'sallegations that he was the victim of excessive force by five citypolice officers in a 1984 incident.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, saidthe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrongly dismissed DethornGraham's civil rights suit after finding that he had failed toprove the police acted maliciously and sadistically.   Under a 1973 Supreme Court decision, that standard of proof isrequired for prison inmates suing officials over alleged physicalabuse.   But Rehnquist said a different standard applies ``in the contextof an arrest or investigatory stop of a free citizen.''   Such incidents, the high court said today, should be judged witha focus on the Fourth Amendment's requirement that police conductbe reasonable.   Most other federal appeals courts already had adopted the``reasonableness'' standard for cases such as Graham's, but the 4thCircuit court's ruling _ until today _ had set a differentprecedent for Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginiaand West Virginia.   Graham, a diabetic, sued Charlotte and five police officers overa Nov. 12, 1984 incident near his home.   Graham's lawsuit said he was at home working on an automobilewhen he felt a diabetic reaction, caused by a reduced level ofsugar in his blood, coming on.   The suit said Graham had a friend drive him to a nearby store,and then rushed in to pick up some orange juice to supplement hisblood sugar.   Graham rushed out of the store without waiting in a longcheck-out line, and asked his friend to drive him to anotherfriend's house, according to court documents.   A police officer who saw Graham enter and leave the storepursued the car and pulled it over.   Graham's lawsuit said that in the ensuing minutes Graham wastreated so roughly by the five police officers that his foot wasbroken, his wrists cut by handcuffs and his face hurt.   A federal judge threw out the suit, and the 4th Circuit courtupheld the dismissal.   The Supreme Court today returned Graham's case to the appealscourt, with instructions to restudy it under the less stringent``reasonableness'' standard of proof.   ``We reject this notion that all excessive force claims broughtunder (federal civil rights law) are governed by a single genericstandard,'' Rehnquist wrote in reversing the 4th Circuit court'sruling.   ``In addressing an excessive force claim ... analysis begins byidentifying the specific constitutional right allegeldy infringedby the challenged application of force,'' he said.   Most times, Rehnquist said, the constitutional right will be theFourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable search and seizure or, inthe prison and jail context, the Eighth Amendment's ban on crueland unusual punishment.   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall agreed with most of Rehnquist's opinion, but objected tothe court's ruling that all excessive-force suits growing out ofarrests and investigatory stops must be scrutinized under a FourthAmendment analysis.   Writing for the three, Blackmun said the court should not havegone as far as to say that ``a substantive due process standard''never should be used in such cases.   The five officers named in Graham's suit were identified incourt records as M.S. Connor, R.B. Townes, T. Rice, Hilda P. Matosand M.M. Chandler.   The case is Graham vs. Connor, 87-6571.</TEXT></DOC>
