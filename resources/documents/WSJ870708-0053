As previously reported, the Thompson family this week agreed to acquire the convenience store retailer in a $4 billion leveraged buyout.    In a tender offer document filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company disclosed that at a time when its stock price was climbing amid heavy trading, Southland management already had met several times with Mr. Belzberg and rebuffed the investor's suggestion that he acquire Southland, possibly in a leveraged buyout at $65 a share. Mr. Belzberg also told Southland executives that he owned a 4.9% Southland stake.    The disclosures are likely to heat up the debate over when a company must let the public know of takeover talks.    In the SEC document, the company also said the Thompson brothers, sons of Southland's founder, plan to raise more than $900 million from asset sales and redeployment of a unit's debt to pare an estimated $4.6 billion in long-term debt. The plan includes selling Southland's ice business, dairies, Chief Auto Parts chain, vacant stores and surplus land. The financial statements also show the slimmed-down company will have net losses through 1990, largely because interest expense will average about $400 million for the next three years.    The company also said yesterday that some shareholders have filed lawsuits against the company, charging that the leveraged buyout is harmful to shareholders and the price is &quot;grossly inadequate.&quot; Southland said it didn't know how many suits had been filed or where they were filed, but said it believes they are without merit.    Separately, the New York Stock Exchange said it is investigating the heavy trading and price increases in the company's stock prior to the buyout announcement. Between late May and last week, Southland shares climbed from the $47-range to nearly $70 on rumors that a raider was acquiring stock and that the company was planning defensive action, such as a special dividend. The stock closed yesterday at $75.625, down 12.5 cents in Big Board composite trading.    The exchange says it routinely examines unusual trading that occurs in a stock before a major announcement is made.    The issue of when Southland should have revealed its Belzberg talks and its own financial alternatives is a gray one, lawyers and regulators say, because the law is somewhat vague and court rulings have been inconsistent. Two years ago, the SEC ruled that companies don't have to comment on takeover rumors, but must be truthful when they do comment.    Since then, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that preliminary takeover discussions needn't be disclosed until a price and structure have been agreed on. The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled that a company can't deny negotiations are under way even if the talks are just preliminary. The Supreme Court has agreed to consider that case.    In Southland's situation, in late May and early June, the company's stock price jumped $9.50 in a week's time, to $58 a share, on rumors that the Belzberg family or others had invested in the company. After the exchange inquired about the trading, Southland said June 3 it didn't know &quot;the basis&quot; for the stock's activity. By then, the tender offer document reveals, company officials had decided to take a hard look at proposing a leveraged buyout.    A Southland spokeswoman said the company didn't have any proof that Mr. Belzberg owned Southland stock and hadn't received a firm offer from him. &quot;In view of all the rumors circulating (about Southland's stock), I think it would have been highly inappropriate&quot; to reveal the Belzberg discussions, she said. She added that the company stands behind all its statements regarding its stock activity.    On June 16, Southland's stock didn't open because of an order imbalance. Again the company said it didn't know the reason. But it did say the company, &quot;like many others whose stock is the subject of rumors,&quot; was looking at financial alternatives with its advisers.    By then, the document states, Southland's board had created a committee of outside directors to evaluate a leveraged buyout or a special dividend of $65 a share. The committee had hired two law firms and Lazard Freres andamp; Co. to advise it.    A week later, there were Wall Street rumors that Southland was considering a special dividend of $60 to $66 a share. But Lazard told the special committee that a $65 a share special dividend carried too many risks. On July 3, the board approved a two-step leveraged buyout; a tender offer for two-thirds of Southland's common shares for $77 a share cash began Monday.    Separately, Southland said it will pay its regular preferred dividend Aug. 15 to stock of record Aug. 1 even if holders tender their shares by the July 31 deadline. But it said it won't pay any further regular common dividends of 28 cents a share because of the pending acquisition.    The company also said that it intends to redeem its 8 3/8% sinking fund debentures due 2002 at a price of 104.188%, its 9 3/8% sinking fund debentures due 2003 at a price of 105.475%, and its 9 1/2% sinking fund debentures due 2004 at 103.8%. </TEXT></DOC>
