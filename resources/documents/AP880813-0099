President Sein Lwin, who stepped down Friday after 17 days inpower, was a strong magnet for the students' anger and passionatedemands for a multi-party system, release of political prisonersand changes in the shattered economy.   ``They are the storm troopers, the spearhead, those who took theinitiative in organizing the demonstrations,'' said Bertil Lintner,a Swedish journalist and scholar specializing in Burma.   The 200,000 university students and about 1.3 million highschool students belong to what some Burmese have called ``a wastedgeneration.''   Thousands of university graduates unable to find jobs in thetroubled economy drive taxis, sell trinkets in the marketplace orserve as night guards. Many have left the isolationist country,where pre-World War II medical books are still used and theReader's Digest was once banned.   On Saturday, a day after Sein Lwin's resignation, the studentscontinued to distribute leaflets urging protests for democracy.   The young people, dozens of whom were killed this year inanti-government protests, appeared to have served as catalysts forSein Lwin's fall. But they stopped short of storming the seat ofpower or proposing a leader to succeed Sein Lwin.   American Burma expert Josef Silverstein said in an interview hebelieves the students are not well organized and do not have strongleaders, and it appears professional military officers would haveto step in to direct political events after Sein Lwin's resignation.   ``Students can make revolution, but not what comes after,'' saidSilverstein, the author of several books on Burma.   The state media announced Friday that the governing BurmaSocialist Program Party _ the country's only political party for aquarter century _ would meet this week, presumably to choose a newleader from the ranks of the military or the present government.   Diplomats and other analysts say the most violent students maygrant a more liberal new leader a ``honeymoon'' period beforeresuming protests that reflect their deep aversion to the existingpolitical system.   But Lintner said the students, who in March virtuallysinglehandedly fought the brutal security forces led by Sein Lwin,were joined in last week's protests by citizens representing a widespectrum of Burmese society, from Buddhist monks to workers.   ``It looks like Asian-style chaos but they have a system and itworks,'' he said in an interview, describing student organizationas necessarily ``elastic and fluid, based on trust and secrecy'' toprevent infiltraton by security services.   In the current issue of the Hong Kong newsmagazine Far EasternEconomic Review, Lintner said the students in the past few monthshave assembled a loose umbrella group known as the All-BurmaStudents Democratic Association, with 20 to 30 leaders at its core.   He said the group includes an information department, anintelligence unit and a social welfare department to distributefood, water and money to demonstrators. The students, who executedthree suspected informants, seized weapons by killing soldiers onnight patrol, he said.   Their main weapons, Lintner said, are knives and homemadespears, or ``jinglee,'' tainted with excrement or poison. Oneforeign journalist said the students' inexperience in streetfighting was evident when a group of protestors appeared uncertainhow to burn a vehicle.   Robert Taylor, a London-based Burma scholar and author, saidRangoon's leaders were ``hoisted by their own ideology.'' Studentsfor years have studied books written by their elders, who in theirown student days fought the British and the Japanese in Burma.   Burmese students entered the political scene in 1920, when theyheld a strike to protest university regulations imposed by theBritish. They remained at the forefront of anti-colonial agitationand played a prominent role during Burma's chaotic post-warexperiment in democracy.   The heady days came to a quick end after the military coup byformer leader Ne Win in 1962. Shortly after Ne Win came to power,Sein Lwin crushed a student protest at Rangoon University andordered troops to blow up the university's student union building,a symbol of student activism.   Since then, students staged about a dozen massive protests, andthe government responded each time by temporarily closing schools,jailing protestors and attempting to infiltrate student groups.   In 1974, the students fought authorities, whom they accused ofgiving the late Burmese U.N. Secretary-General U Thant a burialinappropriate to his respected position.   In March this year, demonstrating students were attacked by SeinLwin's riot police, and the government said more than 43 peoplewere killed. Last week, they led the largest anti-governmentprotests since Burma's colonial times, and the government said atleast 95 people were killed.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Denis D.
