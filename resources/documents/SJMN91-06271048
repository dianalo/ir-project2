Freddy will turn you into acockroach.;   Suffer from anorexia? Freddy will fill you with food until youliterally burst.;   Yet there is something -- can we say it? -- lovable aboutold Fred. Like a black-sheep uncle whom no one talks about but who hascaptured your curiosity, Freddy Krueger has become a cult hero on the collegecampus, on the high-school date scene and in the local video store.;   In themovie business, sequels tend to make less money than the original movie theyfollow. Not Freddy films.;   This maniacal murderer, spawned by a gang assaulton his mother, burned alive and disfigured beyond recognition, only to returnfrom the grave to haunt teen-agers' waking and sleeping moments, has generatedmore than $460 million.;   The Freddy story; Englund swears this is his lasthurrah as Freddy. Why would New Line Cinema want to kill off such a lucrativestar?;   Englund was getting sick of it.;   &quot;Over the years I've been offeredsome interesting projects,&quot; he says. &quot;But I can't do two things at once.&quot;;  Indeed, the 43-year-old Englund is involved in an NBC mid-season replacementanthology series called &quot;Nightmare Cafe.&quot; (Once a nightmare is in your blood,it's hard to get it out of your system.);   Englund plays Blackie, adevil-like figure who runs a diner into which lost souls traipse to try for asecond chance at happiness. There are a couple of friendly ghosts, too, a la&quot;Topper,&quot; who take sides on each story. Englund calls it a cross between &quot;TheTwilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Cheers.&quot;;   Of course, it's too soon to say whether itwill work, but Englund has no such doubts about this latest &quot;Freddy&quot; movie.;  It fills in all the gaps in Freddy's background that likely have kept you upat nights. You'll learn who Freddy's parents were. What his childhood waslike. Whether he has any brothers or sisters. His grade-point average. Hisfavorite color. And, if he could come back as an animal, what animal thatwould be.;   You'll explore the mind of Freddy Krueger. And we don't meanmetaphysically. We mean you'll go on a trip inside Freddy Krueger's head andsee what makes him tick, tick, tick.;   And in the final reel, you'll watchFreddy's demise. In 3D.;   The grateful deadly; &quot;All of our ideas are in thismovie,&quot; says Englund. &quot;New Line really believes this is their big send-off.&quot;;  But is this really the end? After all, Freddy has &quot;died&quot; five times beforeand has come back. How do we know this is really it? Or how do we know thereisn't a Freddy Jr. or Fredricka Krueger lurking in the wings?;   We don't.;  And what about Englund, an actor whose background includes Shakespeare but whohas become wealthy cracking jokes and slitting throats with razor-bladefingernails?;   Despite the tepid reaction to his directorial debut film,&quot;976-EVIL,&quot; Englund says he's not typecast at all.;   &quot;I don't feel myselfimprisoned at all,&quot; he says. &quot;I have a lot of muscle in the horror genre.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEPHEN ADVOKAT, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910927  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  19  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  626  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 27, 199100271048,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
