He said certain military units would be eliminated andfacilities closed, with details to be disclosed next year.   The announcement came two weeks after South Africa completed thewithdrawal of its troops from Namibia, where since 1966 they hadfought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas.   A year ago, South Africa signed a treaty that cleared the wayfor Namibia's independence and also halted South Africaninvolvement in the civil war in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.   These diplomatic developments have prompted speculation that amajor cut in military spending is imminent.   De Klerk, opening a new headquarters for the state armsmanufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in themilitary would have their terms of service shortened.   He said details about this would be disclosed Friday.   The president said it was possible that career militarypersonnel and employees of Armscor, the weapons company, might losetheir jobs as part of the cutback. He said efforts would be made tofind new jobs for these people.   It was the second time in 10 days that the president hadannounced steps which reduce the scope of military operations andinfluence. On Nov. 28, he scrapped a nationwide security networkwhich critics had denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, had been criticized forgiving the security forces too large a role in policy-making. Bothaquit in August after losing a power struggle with de Klerk.   Under the current conscription system, all able-bodied whitemales in South African are required to serve two years of initialmilitary duty and then are eligible for call-up camps that couldamount to two more years of service spread out over 20 or moreyears. Military service for blacks, Asians and people of mixed-raceis voluntary.   In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform militaryservice, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws.   Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1{times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men currently areserving six-year terms _ the youngest, 19-year-old Charles Bester,completed a full year of his sentence on Tuesday.   The government does not release information on the manpower ofthe armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, therehave been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million whitemales of all ages in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
