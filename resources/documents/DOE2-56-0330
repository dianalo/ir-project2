This is the renewal of licensesbeyond the current 40 year plant life (not to be confused with licenseextension involving moving the start date of the 40 year life from theCP issuance to the OL issuance). While it is too early to speculate asto what shape the license renewal policy and regulations will take, itis not too early to conclude that each licensee will have to demonstratewhy its plant can operate safely beyond 40 years. Exactly how this demonstrationmust be made is the subject of an extensive policy development programand rulemaking process at the NRC. There are certain areas of thermalhydraulic analysis that may be important to license renewal. These are1) Pressurized Thermal Shock to Pressure Vessels, 2) Management of SevereAccidents, 3) Plant Simulators, and 4) Transient Histories. Each of theseis briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
