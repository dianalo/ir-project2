Leonard Pelullo was charged yesterday by a federal grandjury in Philadelphia with bilking American Savings andamp; LoanAssociation of Stockton, Calif., of $1.6 million in themid-1980s. Financier Robert Bass acquired the thrift afterits collapse, and it now operates as American Savings Bank.</LP><TEXT>   The 55-count indictment also alleges that in a separatescheme, Mr. Pelullo used fraudulently obtained money to repaya debt to Philadelphia organized-crime figures. Mr. Pelullo'slawyer, Barry Richard, said his client was innocent anddidn't have any mob connections.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said, &quot;The shroud ofconvicted mob bosses is a particularly ominous presence inthis indictment.&quot; But when asked to describe Mr. Pelullo'srelationship to organized crime beyond the debt-repaymentcharge, federal prosecutors referred the question toPennsylvania state authorities.   Fred Martens, executive director of the Pennsylvania CrimeCommission, said in an interview that Mr. Pelullo &quot;is a veryclose associate of Nicodemo Scarfo,&quot; the reputed Philadelphiamob boss who is serving a 60-year prison term for a 1988racketeering conviction. Mr. Martens acknowledged, however,that Mr. Pelullo hasn't ever been formally charged withdirectly participating in organized-crime activities.   Federal and state authorities &quot;don't have one single shredof evidence connecting Len Pelullo to the mob,&quot; Mr. Richardsaid. The lawyer said his client has filed a civil defamationsuit against New Jersey authorities who have accused him ofbeing an organized-crime figure.   The Philadelphia indictment charged that Mr. Pelulloborrowed millions of dollars from American Savings torenovate six hotels in Miami Beach. The defendant allegedlydiverted $1.6 million from the hotel project to his personaluse by overstating the renovation costs.   The indictment also charged that Mr. Pelullo defrauded apublicly traded Miami real estate company of which he waschief executive officer. One count alleged that he siphoned$114,000 from the company, Royale Group Ltd., to repay apersonal loan owed to a Philadelphia man named AnthonyDiSalvo. According to the indictment, Mr. Pelullo paid thedebt &quot;at the request of Nicodemo Scarfo and PhillipLeonetti.&quot; No other mention was made of Messrs. Scarfo andLeonetti.   Mr. Leonetti, Mr. Scarfo's convicted underboss in thePhiladelphia mob, is cooperating with authorities in avariety of investigations. Mr. DiSalvo &quot;is a longtime Scarfoassociate,&quot; said Mr. Martens. Mr. Richard denied there wasanything wrong in the dealings with Mr. DiSalvo. Mr. Pelullo&quot;borrowed money, and he repaid it,&quot; Mr. Richard said. &quot;Thatdoesn't mean that he is a member of the mob or does anybusiness with them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
