As Mr. Dukakis campaigned here in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania this week in the new role of underdog in his struggle with Vice President George Bush, Mr. Hagan and a growing chorus of Democrats across the country are troubled that the Massachusetts governor's campaign has lost its edge along with its lead. Some Democrats, moreover, are worried that the Dukakis campaign has stalled even as the Bush campaign has encountered the turbulence of the imbroglio over the academic, military and personal life of Sen. Dan Quayle, Mr. Bush's running mate.    &quot;After our convention we got into a lull and our expectations got way too high,&quot; says Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic Whip. &quot;Getting behind in the polls may be the best thing that ever happened to us. The whole Dukakis staff began to think this would be a walk, something easy. We need to understand that this is going to be a fight, a close race.&quot;    Indeed, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that Mr. Bush holds a seven-percentage-point lead among likely voters and that the slice of the electorate that views the vice president unfavorably has dropped to about the same level as those who hold unfavorable views of the Massachusetts governor.    &quot;This election is a dead heat,&quot; says Peter Kelly, the Democratic chairman in California, &quot;and we have to regain the offensive.&quot;    Democratic leaders say publicly that they expected the Dukakis lead, which in early August was 10 points, to close; but privately they are concerned that Mr. Bush is doing so well despite his troubles. And some political analysts are comparing Gov. Dukakis -- and his public schedule, chock full of events at Boston's State House and in the far corners of Massachusetts -- with New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, who sat in Albany and squandered a lead over Harry Truman in 1948.    &quot;I'd like the campaign to critically examine how the candidate spends his time,&quot; says Richard Wiener, the Michigan Democratic chairman.    The irony -- acknowledged by Dukakis campaign strategists -- is that the tempest over Mr. Quayle has hurt the Dukakis campaign in its effort to present the Massachusetts governor and his message of jobs and development to the public.    &quot;We haven't had equal time the past two weeks,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, a top Dukakis adviser. &quot;The Republicans are dominating the news, and we haven't had a chance to get our message across.&quot;    Mr. O'Donnell and other Dukakis campaign strategists say the new poll figures are &quot;a much more realistic representation of where the electorate is.&quot; Mr. O'Donnell argues that two recent decisions by Mr. Bush -- the selection of Sen. Quayle as his running mate and his refusal to enter early debates -- will prompt the public to pause and re-evaluate Mr. Bush once again.    The Dukakis camp, meanwhile, plans no abrupt adjustments in strategy. Its theme of &quot;good jobs at good wages,&quot; coupled with the argument that Mr. Dukakis proved in Massachusetts the potential of a &quot;partnership&quot; approach to economic development, weren't the most exciting messages of 1988 but have proved to be the most durable. The campaign isn't about to jettison them now that Labor Day approaches.    &quot;We've laid out a program and we're keeping to it,&quot; says Charles Campion, the campaign's national political director. &quot;We're running an offensive, not a defensive campaign.&quot;    At the same time, Democrats across the country know that Mr. Dukakis can't seize the debate again until the Quayle flap fades.    &quot;With all the stories about Quayle, if you had tried to propose a new defense plan or whatever, it would have gotten ignored,&quot; says John Willis, vice chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party. John Baker, the Alabama chairman, adds: &quot;Gov. Dukakis is somewhat trapped himself. His statements can't get more coverage until the focus shifts.&quot;    The Republicans used the week after the Democrats' Atlanta convention to step up their attacks on Mr. Dukakis and to begin to deflate his claims about his record at home and his promises about the economic future of the country. Mr. Dukakis campaigned during the GOP convention, but won scant attention with his effort to provide a visual contrast to the Republicans' gathering in New Orleans by appealing to Reagan Democrats and blacks.    This week, he received the endorsement of the AFL-CIO and repaid it with an address that bowed to many of the labor federation's pet causes, including a higher minimum wage and universal health coverage. In Grand Rapids, Mich., he outlined his vision of involving local, state and federal governments in promoting economic development and spurring new technologies. And here in Cleveland yesterday, he called for a post-election Latin American summit on the drug trade.    &quot;The Republicans are at least entertaining,&quot; complains Harrison Hickman, a Democratic consultant. &quot;Right now it's a choice between a soap opera and a position paper. Even if the Republicans are having their troubles, at least they're interesting.&quot;    While Mr. Dukakis raises enormous sums of money -- $1.2 million in a fundraiser here Wednesday night -- there are concerns that the candidate ought to spend his evenings with the beer-and-brat crowd instead of big donors, including a number of executives from the construction industry.    The most frequent criticism is that the Dukakis campaign is too isolated in its Boston redoubt, too clinical in its approach to politics.    &quot;The problem is that they haven't inspired anyone,&quot; says Mr. Hagan, the Cuyahoga County commissioner. &quot;They've forgotten that people are not automatons. They don't realize that dreams aren't measured in algebraic expressions. You can't sit around with Harvard sociologists and understand America, and they won't be told that.&quot;    The Dukakis campaign performs the mechanical tasks of politics with crisp efficiency. James Ruvolo, the Ohio Democratic chairman, says the party's campaign organization is &quot;way ahead&quot; of where it was four years ago. About 500 people turned up for a training session for volunteers this month in Columbus. And the Dukakis forces have made an effort to include supporters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the Ohio effort.    But the campaign still must supply an emotional element. &quot;The national campaign has to energize us,&quot; Mr. Ruvolo says. &quot;He has to be here and he has to talk about what matters.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
