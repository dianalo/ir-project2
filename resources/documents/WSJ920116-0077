It's called the PowerBook and isthe first notebook-size Macintosh.   Apple Computer was late getting to market with anotebook-size machine. But the top-of-the-line PowerBook 170model I tested was elegantly designed and well built. Thethree PowerBook models are, overall, excellent computers.They include several features to enhance notebook computing,but remain fully powered Macintoshes.   That means the pint-size models, like all Macs, are easyto master and use, because they rely on the path-breakingMacintosh approach, in which users control the computer bymanipulating pictures and consistent, plain-English menus.Behind this simple presentation, called a graphicalinterface, there's ample computing power and speed to run awide range of serious software.   But the hot-selling little Macs have some irritatingdrawbacks. Their floppy disk drive design can cause realheadaches. In addition, the machines don't come equipped toeasily use floppy disks from IBM-compatible computers --though Apple says it wants to sell these machines toIBM-compatible owners. And the PowerBooks lack severalconvenience features common on the many IBM-compatiblenotebooks.   The PowerBook that I tested fit easily on the pull-downtray at my airplane seat. It had, without question, thebrightest, sharpest screen I've seen in a portable computer-- easily readable either with sunlight streaming through thewindow or in the dark during the bad in-flight movie.                                                                                                          To eliminate the need for a dangling mouse pointingdevice, Apple has built in a &quot;trackball&quot;a rotating sphereinset below the keyboard that moves the cursor as you turnit. There's also a large space on each side of the trackballto rest your wrists. And there are retractable legs toprovide a comfortable typing angle.   Under the hood, the top two PowerBook models -- the 170and 140 -- have high-powered, fast processor chips, memory ofup to eight megabytes, and hard disk drives up to 40megabytes in size -- plenty for mobile computing. Batterylife is good -- I got 2 1/2 to three hours per charge -- andthere's an on-screen battery gauge. The top two models weigh6.8 pounds each, and the low-end 100 model, which lacks aninternal floppy disk drive, weighs just 5.1 pounds.   The PowerBooks are tailored for communication. They havebuilt-in hardware and software for linking via cables toother computers, and a 2,400-baud modem -- standard on the170, optional on the others -- that transmits both data andfaxes. Apple also includes new software that lets a user dialup a Macintosh in a remote location and tap into it, if hehas permission. I called my office Mac in Washington from ahotel in San Francisco and transferred files by moving thetiny onscreen pictures representing the files from a windowrepresenting the remote Mac to a window representing myPowerBook.   The PowerBooks seem a bit pricey, though it's hard to puta value on the Mac's trademark graphical interface, stillsolidly superior to its most famous imitator, Microsoft'sIBM-compatible Windows program. The 170 sells for just under$4,000, with four megabytes of memory and a 40megabyte harddrive. The 140, which has a slightly inferior (but stillbright) screen, costs $2,300 to $2,700, depending on memoryand hard disk capacity. The model 100 costs just under$2,000.                                                                                                          For those prices, Apple should have done a better job onthe floppy disk drive. On early production models, electricalinterference from the screen made the drives falter whentrying to read some disks. Apple says that the bug is fixed,and that fewer than 2% of the PowerBooks show any defects.   But Apple officials concede that the PowerBooks still mayfail to read some disks produced for software companies bydisk-duplication firms. That's because the PowerBook'sslender disk drives are less tolerant of variations in theduplication process than are the drives on bigger Macs. BothModel 170s I used failed to read two of several dozencommercial disks I tried (though the disks sometimes workedif I dimmed the screen.) Apple says disk duplicators shoulddo better, but that isn't much consolation to a PowerBookowner who can't use a newly purchased disk.   In addition, Apple should have included free with thePowerBooks special software that lets the Mac automaticallyrecognize disks from IBM-compatibles. The company is expectedto offer such software later this year, but as an extra-costoption.   Finally, the PowerBooks suffer from a not-invented-heresyndrome. Apple ignored some useful features common on othernotebooks, including: a socket for connecting externalmonitors; function, &quot;home&quot; and &quot;end&quot; keys; and lights showingdisk drive activity and battery status (when the machine isoff).   Apple, which is enamored of sound, includes a microphonewith each PowerBook. It would have been smarter to build inmore mundane, but more useful, features instead.</TEXT></DOC>
