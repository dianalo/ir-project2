On Friday night, President Daniel Ortega gave the diplomats 72hours to leave. He also ordered the mission to reduce itsadministrative staff from 320 to 100. Most of those employees areNicaraguan nationals.   ``We were at grave risk of a political-military clash with theUnited States, which has maintained an aggressive attitude againstLatin American countries,'' Ortega said.   The action came after U.S. troops invaded the Nicaraguanambassador's house in Panama City despite his protests. A seniorU.S. official in Panama City called the search a mistake and saidtroops did not know they were in a diplomatic residence.   The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said 15 U.S. diplomats would beallowed to remain in the country, the minimum prescribed by theVienna Convention.   ``The measure of the Sandinista government is drastic andunjustified,'' said Louis Falino, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassyin Managua who spoke to The Associated Press by telephone. Falinowas on the list of those expelled.   President Bush said in Houston on Saturday that an apology hadbeen made.   ``It's a screw-up and they (U.S. military officials in Panama)have expressed their regrets that it happened,'' Bush said. Headded that ``it shouldn't have happened and that's been explainedto the Nicaraguans.''   U.S. officials said soldiers were acting on a tip that a largecache of weapons was stored at the home. Soldiers returned theweapons after realizing it was the Nicaraguan diplomat's residence,the State Department said.   The search of Ambassador Antenor Ferrey's residence in PanamaCity was ``outrageous...insolent'' and ``violated principles ofinternational law,'' Ortega said.   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' Ortega said.   He claimed the U.S. soldiers stole more than $2,000 and tooksome clothes from the residence. U.S. reaction to the charge wasnot immediately available.   Tension between the two countries increased after the Dec. 20U.S. invasion of Panama and the overthrow of Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega. If it does not ease, it could give Ortega an excuse tocancel presidential elections set for Feb. 25.   ``We have never discarded the possibility'' of a U.S. invasionof Nicaragua,'' said Manuel Rodriguez, political adviser at theNicaraguan Embassy in Panama. He spoke before the search, lookingdown on U.S. troops manning barricades of wire and sandbags at theembassy and checking identification on a side street.   ``It's just that the results would not be the same as in Panama.It would cost them a lot more.''   Nicaragua's Soviet-equipped military is the largest force inCentral America.   The United States has not had an ambassador in Managua sinceJuly 1988, when the leftist Sandinista government expelledAmbassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats toprotest alleged American interference in an opposition rally inNicaragua.   The United States responded by expelling Nicaraguan AmbassadorCarlos Tunnerman.   U.S. soldiers circled the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama last weekin case Noriega sought refuge there. Nicaragua's Foreign Ministrythen ordered the U.S. Embassy in Managua surrounded.</TEXT></DOC>
