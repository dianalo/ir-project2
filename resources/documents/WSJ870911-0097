When presidential hopefuls of both parties gather at the University of North Carolina today for a forum on education policy, they will tackle one of the hottest topics in American politics. For the first time in a quarter-century, education is emerging as a major issue in presidential politics. This time the battle may be fought most fiercely in the Republican Party.    &quot;Republicans always conceded the education issue to the Democrats, but that's changed,&quot; says former Republican Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is regarded as a GOP pioneer in education issues. &quot;We've decided that the future absolutely depends on the schools -- and that today you can't talk the Republican language of economic development without talking about education.&quot;    Already, former Delaware Gov. Pierre du Pont has outlined a plan to have schools compete for students and is proposing an expanded program of government-guaranteed education loans. Vice President George Bush, using the issue to establish his independence from President Reagan, is talking about increased federal aid and a college-savings program that would shield income from taxes if applied to tuition. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York is pushing a proposal to teach foreign languages as early as kindergarten.    &quot;This may be the only area in the entire campaign where some good new ideas are percolating up,&quot; says Denis Doyle, a senior research fellow at the Hudson Institute and a specialist in education policy. &quot;The Republicans seem to have homed in on the education issue. They've done some creative thinking, and some of the new ideas are genuinely interesting.&quot;    There is a strong element of political opportunism to the sudden Republican focus on these issues: Improved education is a hard platform to oppose. Moreover, to Republicans approaching the post-Reagan era these issues have great appeal because they afford a way to express independence from the president without alienating conservatives. Education offers Republicans a means to sound future-oriented and appeal to young voters, a way to address the &quot;competitiveness&quot; question without embracing protectionism, and a chance to offer positive programs rather than just oppose what the Democrats propose.    &quot;Education,&quot; says Roy Pfautch, a Republican political consultant, &quot;is a family and community issue and central to the Republican effort to win the heart of the middle-American voter.&quot;    The result is a series of Republican education programs that promises to infuse the schools with values, bring discipline to the classroom and make higher education affordable -- with very little discussion of the cost and with little regard to the small role Republicans believe the federal government should play in education.    Democrats, traditionally the political advocates of education, haven't been ignoring the issue. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, arguing that &quot;a child's real learning begins long before the first grade,&quot; is proposing federal aid for early-childhood education and subsidized day care. Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware is arguing for a longer school day and year, plus expanded loan programs. And Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is advocating smaller classes and bigger salaries for teachers.    But the ferment among Republicans on education issues has eclipsed that in the Democratic Party. &quot;Because they've never been aligned with the teachers' unions, the Republicans have much more freedom to move, even to be innovative,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist. &quot;Unlike the Democrats, they're not 'protectionist' on education.&quot;    At the same time, education has political primacy in the states with early campaign tests. New Hampshire, the site of the first primary, has the highest Scholastic Aptitude Test scores in the nation; Iowa, the site of the first caucuses, has the highest American College Test scores. GOP Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, who attributes his second-term victory last November to his excellence-in-education plan, says that Republicans in his state are so concerned about education that they could &quot;make it something that could decide their vote.&quot;    For that reason, the National Education Association, which has endorsed Democrats in the past three elections, is wading into Republican presidential politics for the first time. With 600,000 Republican members, the powerful teachers' union is working to establish a presence at the GOP convention -- the goal is 100 delegates -- and probably will endorse a Republican in the primary season as well as a Democrat.    &quot;There's a lot of debate over education in the Republican Party,&quot; says Kenneth Melley, the NEA director of governmental relations, &quot;and we want to be part of it.&quot;    Education Secretary William Bennett opened up the issue this week when, in a speech in Washington, he called the NEA &quot;the most entrenched and aggressive opponent to education reform&quot; and urged Democrats to &quot;stand up to&quot; it. He called on Republicans to put forward plans for education that go beyond &quot;criticism and nostalgia,&quot; adding that the GOP agenda should include improving education of the disadvantaged.    At the heart of the Republican debate over education policy are the worries of business leaders who have long been a primary party constituency. They say U.S. schools are failing to produce workers with the skills needed to keep the nation competitive in the world economy.    &quot;There's nothing -- nothing -- that worries American CEOs as much as whether we're going to be able to change our schools and produce people who can think of new things,&quot; says former Democratic Gov. James Hunt of North Carolina, one of the moderators of today's forum here.    David Mandel, associate director of the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, adds: &quot;People are beginning to understand that workers who can think for a living are the key to the economic future.&quot;    That concern has led Vice President Bush to break from President Reagan in supporting expanded federal educational assistance, especially to the disadvantaged and the illiterate. &quot;If we provide special attention to those with special needs, we can wipe out illiteracy the way we wiped out polio,&quot; he told the National Conference of State Legislatures this summer.    The Bush campaign's most visible proposal is the College Savings Bond plan, which would allow parents to make taxfree investments to apply to their children's tuition payments. Under this plan -- variations of which have been floated by Kansas Sen. Robert Dole and other Republicans -- parents could cover the estimated average cost of college tuition 18 years from now by investing $140 a month for a private college or $25 a month for a public school. Mr. Dole's plan is structured along the lines of Individual Retirement Accounts to provide incentives for savings.    Other Republican candidates have responded with their own ambitious programs, several of them envisioning higher federal spending on education. &quot;Money isn't the issue, it's the deployment of funds,&quot; says Secretary Bennett. &quot;This is an area where nobody will try to out-cheap the other guy.&quot;    Mr. du Pont is proposing a national schooling and training bank to permit any citizen of any age to use government-guaranteed loans, to be issued by private banks at market rates, to attend an educational institution. The loan contracts would specifically permit the government to collect delinquent payments by adding them to income-tax bills.    &quot;The opportunity is there,&quot; Mr. du Pont tells students, &quot;but it's your responsibility because it's your future.&quot;    All six GOP candidates endorse educational assistance to disadvantaged children in the form of vouchers, though the Rev. Pat Robertson opposes any voucher plan that would let the government interfere with private religious schools.    Mr. du Pont goes even further in support of vouchers; he wants Washington to encourage states to provide for parental choice and for competition in all elementary and secondary education. &quot;I hope the bad schools would shut,&quot; he says. &quot;I say {to states that} you don't get your education aid unless you put some competition into your school system and let parents have some choice.&quot;    At the same time, Rep. Kemp has been suggesting expanding the &quot;magnet school&quot; concept, a federally subsidized plan that encourages desegregation without busing by providing students with a choice of specialized secondary schools. &quot;Magnet schools work,&quot; he tells black Republicans, &quot;and I believe they offer an educational alternative that should be expanded where needed and protected as a vehicle for educational opportunity and scholarly choice.&quot;    For all their rhetoric, however, the Republicans are finding that the political opportunity they see in the educational issue is blunted by a fundamental tenet of conservatism: the principle of local control of the schools.    &quot;America's schools cannot be run effectively from some distant center,&quot; former Secretary of State Alexander Haig told graduating seniors at Trinity High School in Manchester, N.H., this spring. Sen. Dole adds: &quot;Education is a national concern, a state responsibility and a local function. The federal government is clearly the junior partner.&quot;    Moreover, former Tennessee Gov. Alexander warns fellow Republicans not to define education &quot;the easy way,&quot; as a primarily federal concern. &quot;A Washington program,&quot; he warns, &quot;is probably the worst thing these people can do.&quot;    ---   Republicans on Education Issues    George Bush   Favors more aid to poor students, more spending for Head Start, expansion of income-contingent loans and a College Savings Bond program of tax-free parental saving for children's tuition.
