 Last month I looked at some of the changes in the market forPostScript-com-andM;patible fonts for LaserWriters and their ilk, such as the apparent crackingof Adobe's PostScript font-encryption scheme and the importance of the&quot;hints&quot; embedded in Adobe's fonts to improve the type's appearance at smallpoint sizes.andP;  This month I'll offer some of my own hints about choosing andusing Macintosh typefaces.andM;Typeface availability has long been an area in which the Mac outstrips DOSmachines - and lately that gap has grown even wider.andP;  It doesn't seem likelyto narrow in the foreseeable future either: Macs simply make more sense forthe kind of precise work - such as typography - where subtle differences indetails can make a big difference.andM;During this time of typographic upheaval, there's been a lot of confusionabout such things as Adobe's much-misunderstood hinting system for gettingbetter results in small type sizes.andP;  (Hints make a difference in 300-dpiprinting of type sizes smaller than about I 0 points and a big difference insizes smaller than 6 or 7 points.)andM;A focus on what might be viewed as the arcana of Mac typography has cloudedthe more important issue for users: making intelligent and useful choicesamong the new fonts while avoiding unnecessary duplication or ugly documentsthat result from mismatched typefaces.andP;  So let's take a look at some of theemerging ground rules for buying Mac laser-printer fonts.andM;Don't mix typefaces with the same name from different vendors.andP;  For example,avoid mixing Adobe's Futura with Bitstream's Futura.andP;  Each digital-typehouse's PostScript interpretation of these faces (even when the faces aretightly controlled standard fonts licensed from one of the major firms suchandM;as ITC) will vary, often just enough to give your finished piece an odd look.andM;Don't miss the newcomers in the Mac type business.andP;  Although Adobe was thefirst playerandM;in the PostScript type business and still offers what is by far the widestrange of typefaces, well translated for relatively lowresolution outputdevices such as 300-dpi LaserWriters, other vendors have useful typefacestoo.andM;Bitstream eased into the Mac market earlier this year, releasing MacFontwarepackages from its huge library of digital typefaces.andP;  Bitstream is as big inthe MS-DOS world as Adobe is in the Mac world and has been in the business ofproviding professional, well-designed type for some time.andP;  Both companies arenow trying to take over the other's playing ground.andP;  If Bitstream succeeds inthe Macintosh market with this first wave of releases, we can expect to see alot more new faces for the Mac.andM;Image Club has many of the same faces (including ITC licensed fonts) asAdobe, plus others that are unavailable elsewhere.andP;  In addition to sellingfonts individually, Image ClubandM;also offers 600 typefaces on CD-ROM.andP;  If you don't want to pay for all ofthem at first, you can buy the CD-ROM and then selectively unlock faces asyou need them, paying an additional sum each time.andP;  Adobe recognizes a goodidea when it sees one: It now has more than 350 of its screen fonts added tothe newandM;CD-ROM Microsoft Office.andP;  I wouldn't be surprised to see Adobe follow up witha CD- ROM of its own.andM;Casady andamp; Greene have several striking display-size faces - as does Olduvai -although those fonts usually don't work well in smaller body-copy sizes.andP;  Andthere are other small digital-type foundries, some offering only two or threetypefaces, that have useful, attractive fonts for sale.andP;  It pays to lookaround.andM;Look for fonts especially designed for 300-dpi output.andP;  Both Sumner Stone,the type design guru at Adobe, and Matthew Carter, his counterpart atBitstream, have designed new typefaces that look good within the resolutionconstraints of laser printers.andP;  By avoiding such touches as thin serifs andtight curves, the Stone and Carter series skirt the jaggies so common in typeprinted on LaserWriters.andM;I find the Stone series - which is made up of three basic families:andM;Stone Informal, Stone Sans, and Stone Serif, with the usual Roman, bold, anditalic variations in each family - among the most useful Mac fonts I own.andO;Sometimes they look a bit heavy - an unavoidable problem with typefacesintentionally designed to avoid very thin strokes andandM;curlicues -but as a group, they can form the core of a valuable extension tothe famous 35 fonts embedded in ROM inside the LaserWriter Plus and itssuccessors and clones.andM;Buy families of typefaces, not random fonts.andP;  I cringe when I see a Macowner's shelf full of mismatched onesytwosy fonts.andP;  Concentrate your dollarson families of fonts that give you compatible stroke-width and weightvariations from light through book, medium, demibold, bold, and black.andM;Look at font packages that extend the fonts inside your laser printer in thesame way.andP;  For example, buying Helvetica Light and Helvetica Black can extendthe usefulness of the Helvetica Regular in your LaserWriter.andM;Use weight variations supplied by vendors instead of relying on the Mac'sinternal type-style variations.andP;  &quot;Fattening up&quot; a standard-weight font israrely as effective as using a true demibold, bold, heavy, or black fontdrawn at that weight.andM;Install as many sizes of the screen fonts in your System rile as your typevendor supplies.andP;  And copy over Adobe's .AFM (Adobe Font Metric) files aswell.andP;  Installing all the provided screen fonts gives you much betteron-screen representations than you'll get by installing only the bare-minimum10- and 12-point sizes.andM;And although not many programs presently use the data provided in.AFM files -MacWrite-format text files that tell programs the specific measurements ofAdobe fonts so they can be kerned and otherwise manipulated with greaterprecision - more and more programs will begin using them during the nextyear.andM;Next month I'll wrap up this look at Mac PostScript typography with somesuggestions on font-management and font-manipulation programs I use andrecommend - from old favorites such as Suitcase II and MasterJuggler tolittle known wonders such as the fontier shareware gem Font Display and greatnew products such as Smart Art.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
