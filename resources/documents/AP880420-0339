The Treasury's key 30-year bond, which has fallen $25 per $1,000in face amount since last Thursday, rose \ point, or about $2.50.   The bond's yield, which moves inversely to its price and is animportant signal of interest rate trends, slipped to 9 percent from9.04 percent late Tuesday. A week ago the bond yielded 8.73 percent.   Bond prices initially sagged after the Labor Department reporteda 0.5 percent jump in March consumer prices, the biggest increasesince January 1987. The advance was larger than most analysts hadexpected and it drove bond prices lower because it providedadditional evidence that inflation may be accelerating. Bondinvestors fear inflation because it erodes the value of theirholdings.   But bond prices reversed course later in the day and headedhigher.   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research forthe investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the recentdecline in bond prices has been so quick and deep that some tradersfelt it may have gone too far for the moment.   He said some traders also saw that a major reason for the strongconsumer price growth in March was rising clothing costs, andconcluded the surge could be temporary.   ``Without the rise in apparel costs, the CPI would have been upby 0.4 percent or so and that is seen as being more manageable,''Sullivan said.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-termmaturities edged up 1-32 point, intermediate maturities were up bybetween [ point and \ point and 20-year issues rose ] point, thefinancial information service Telerate Inc. reported.   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of abond with a $1,000 face value.   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures pricemovements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of ayear or longer, rose 0.17 to 110.52. The Shearson Lehman HuttonDaily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose1.65 to 1,156.33.   In corporate trading, industrials rose } point and utilitiesrose \ point in moderate dealings.   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measuresprice movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five yearsor longer, fell 0.37 to 278.20.   Among tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices edged down [ point inlight trading.   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 2 basis points to 5.82percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Six-month bills rose 2 basis points to 6.24 percent but year billswere unchanged at 6.62 percent.   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, traded at 7} percent, up from 613-16 percent late Tuesday.   Sullivan said it was unclear whether the rise in the funds rateindicated a tightening of the Federal Reserve's money policybecause Wednesday was the end of a reserve reporting period forbanks. The short-term lending rate often rises sharply on such daysas financial institutions borrow to meet reserve requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
