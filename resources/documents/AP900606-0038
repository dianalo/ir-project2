Terry Branstad, who ran unopposed in hisparty's primary.   With 2,566 of 2,567 precincts reporting, Avenson had 78,767votes, or 39 percent; to 63,129 votes, or 32 percent, for AttorneyGeneral Tom Miller; and 52,031 votes, or 26 percent, for formerbanker John Chrystal. Lt. Gov. Joann Zimmerman had 4,512 votes, or 2percent, and retiree Darold Powers received 1,272 votes, or 1percent.   An Iowa Poll conducted for the Des Moines Register the last weekof the campaign showed Avenson leading with 32 percent of likelyDemocratic voters, followed by Miller at 25 percent and Chrystal at19 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9percentage points.</TEXT><TEXT>   The primary began as a referendum on abortion but became morecomplicated in the closing days. Branstad focused on raising moneyand had $2.5 million, more than double the combined total of theDemocratic field.   Miller opposes abortion; Chrystal and Avenson are pro-choice.Polls had shown a majority of voters considered themselvespro-choice but abortion rights activists worried that two candidateswould split the vote.   Branstad also opposes abortion.   Avenson, 45, had the support of the National Organization forWomen and the National Abortion Rights Action League, which rantelevision commercials and sent mail on his behalf.   Miller, 45, charged that out-of-state special-interest groupswere trying to influence the outcome of the election.   He discounted the abortion issue, saying he would approve onlylimited restrictions, such as requiring parents be notified. Millersought to deflect attention by focusing on tighter restrictionsagainst drunken driving, and saying Avenson ``identifies with thedrunk driver.''   Avenson called Miller's proposal ``insane'' and said it wouldmake criminals of people who have two beers. Chrystal, 64, urged thetwo to talk about more serious issues, pushing his plan to improvetrade with the Soviet Union.   The health of the candidates became an issue in the closingweeks, when Avenson was hospitalized for emergency medicalprocedures to clear a clogged artery in his heart.</TEXT></DOC>
