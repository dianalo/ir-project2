Mr. Greenspan said that forcing banks to value only someassets at market prices -- rather than at their original cost-- &quot;would likely reduce the amount of securities bankingorganizations are willing to hold, and thus, adversely affectbank liquidity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   His comments came in a written response to questions fromthe Senate Banking Committee that was released yesterday.   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and his staffers haverecently stepped up their campaign to force banks to adoptso-called market-value accounting on bank debt securities.   The SEC has a congressional mandate to oversee accountingstandards, though it cedes day-to-day responsibility toindustry accounting groups. The agency recently has beenpressuring those groups to push a market-value approach.   While Mr. Breeden has specified that he doesn't want toinclude bank loans in the plan, Mr. Greenspan again voicedhis strong opposition. The Fed chairman noted that such apolicy was in effect before 1938, but that &quot;serious concerns&quot;by federal regulators over how it was affecting the health ofthe banks led to the abandonment of the concept.   Applying market-value accounting to a large segment of abank's assets, without using those methods for the entirebalance sheet, would produce a particularly &quot;distortedpicture of the institution's earnings and capital,&quot; Mr.Greenspan warned.   The Fed chairman, who has long spoken out againstmarket-value accounting, also asserted that the changes beingsought by the SEC would be especially &quot;disruptive&quot; during arecession.   In a speech to bankers in San Antonio, Texas, yesterday,Mr. Greenspan reiterated that the Fed believes that &quot;theamount of monetary ease now in the pipeline is adequate toturn the economy onto the path of sustained recovery.&quot; Butthe Fed chairman qualified that statement, as he has before,by adding that Fed is prepared to cut interest rates &quot;ifnecessary.&quot; Mr. Greenspan's comments were the first in publicsince Fed policy makers met last week to set policy for thenext few weeks. Their decision hasn't been disclosed, but theFed hasn't cut rates in the week that has passed since themeeting.   In answering the Senate Banking Committee's queries, Mr.Greenspan added reassuringly that &quot;although forecasting isparticularly difficult in the current environment, theredoesn't appear to be a significant risk of prolongedstagnations or general recession in the major foreignindustrial countries.&quot;   On other matters, the Fed chairman gave the followinganswers to the panel:   -- A policy that &quot;seeks to depreciate the dollar againstthe yen . . . is not an appropriate way to stimulate theeconomy.&quot; Some economists say such a policy would spur U.S.exports, but Mr. Greenspan said it could provecounterproductive.   -- Mr. Greenspan is no longer abstaining in decisionsinvolving Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International and FirstAmerican Bankshares, a Washington bank in which BCCI held asecret interest. As reported, he abstained from a Jan. 30,1991, vote because of his acquaintance with Robert Altman,president of First American. &quot;Subsequently,&quot; he said, &quot;Iconcluded that my limited acquaintance with Mr. Altman didn'tpose a conflict of interest.&quot;   -- Beginning in March, the Fed plans to publicize -- anddistribute to libraries -- its semi-annual listing of termscharged by 160 large credit-card issuers, some of whichcharge relatively low interest rates or little or no annualfees.</TEXT></DOC>
