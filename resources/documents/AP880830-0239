Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inNicosia, said Subroto, Indonesia's former Energy Minister, made thecomments after a meeting with President Ali Khamenei in Tehran.   Subroto arrived Monday from Kuwait seeking to persuade Iran toagree to allow Iraq an OPEC quota of at least 2.39 million barrelsa day.   Iraq has refused to accept a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day,about half its current output, and insists on parity with Iran.   The deadlock, with Iraq pumping an estimated 2.5 million barrelsa day to boost its revenue and repair its war-damaged economy, hasworsened the problem of over-production by some OPEC member states.   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry weeklypublished in Nicosia, said Monday the output by the 13-membercartel this month was around 20 million barrels a day.   That's about 3.5 million barrels a day over OPEC's overallproduction quota and was seen as a key factor in depressing worldoil prices.   IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying OPEC members should strictlyadhere to their quotas. But he too made no direct mention of theissue of Iraq's quota.   But he did note that among Iran's prime concerns were OPEC unityand resolving the organization's problems.   Subroto was expected to fly to Baghdad, Iraq's capital, throughKuwait Wednesday.   He had talks Monday with Iran's Oil Minister, GholamrezaAqazadeh. IRNA said Subroto briefed Aqazadeh on his earlier visitsto Venezuela, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Kuwait on theover-production issue. But it gave no details.   OPEC overcame a major stumbling block to its efforts to imposeproduction discipline earlier this month after Venezuela droppedits veto against giving Iraq a quota equal to Iran's.   Eleven of the OPEC states now agree to that. Iran is now theonly holdout.   With the United Nations-sponsored Aug.20 cease-fire apparentlyholding, Iraq and Iran have both started repairing oil facilitiesdamaged in the nearly eight years of fighting.   Oil industry sources believe that Iraq will be able to installmakeshift oil loading terminals in the northern gulf within a fewmonths, allowing it to boost its export capacity by 1 millionbarrels a day.   Iraq is also expanding its export pipeline network, which wouldincrease its production capacity to more than 3 million barrels aday by the end of the decade.   The Iranians are repairing the heavily bombed Kharg islandterminal, which accounts for 90 percent of their oil exports.   Iran's deputy oil minister, Khazempour Ardebili said earlierthis month that Tehran's long-term target is to boost production toaround 4.5 million barrels a day, its pre-war level.   But the Middle East Economic Survey noted that in the shortterm, production will likely only increase to around 2.8 millionbarrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
