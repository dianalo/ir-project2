Robert Dole.    The move would be a significant boost for the Dole campaign, but another indication that the Reagan administration is likely to suffer more high-level departures as it winds down its final term.    Mr. Brock is identified with the mainstream of the Republican Party, and is considered one of the most respected former GOP chairmen in decades. He was a senator before he served as party chairman in the 1970s. Mr. Brock has lately been seen as a loyalist to President Reagan and his conservative administration, which he also served as special trade representative.    He would be the second Reagan cabinet member to quit this fall to join the Dole campaign. Elizabeth Dole, wife of the Kansas senator, resigned as transportation secretary Oct. 1 to work full time for her husband's campaign.    Mr. Brock couldn't be reached last night for comment.    Rumors have circulated for several weeks that Mr. Brock was contemplating a departure, and that he might be considering joining the Dole campaign. Over the weekend, Newsweek magazine reported that the move was imminent.    As both an experienced politician and administrator, Mr. Brock would strengthen the management of the Dole campaign. Though Sen. Dole has been showing increasing strength in recent months, particularly in the crucial early-caucus state of Iowa, his campaign has been criticized as poorly organized.    For the Reagan administration, Mr. Brock's departure may be only one in a series of high-level departures over the next year, as the end of the term draws closer and the presidential campaign season heats up. Besides Mrs. Dole, Kenneth Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, also has announced plans to leave.    For the Labor Department, Brock's decision will mean the departure of a vigorous, effective and widely respected cabinet officer, who has had admirers in both labor and business.    His departure could mean &quot;heavy changes&quot; at the department, said one official. Any successor could well be a caretaker, unlikely to pursue Brock programs with the same skill and fervor, aides said.    Mr. Brock lately has been pushing legislation creating a federal-worker retraining and relocation program, as well as advocating a restructuring of the government's pension-insurance program to secure private employees' pensions and pump premiums into the struggling federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.    Meanwhile, Mr. Brock has been working to temper a spate of bills for new benefits or improved work conditions being pushed by unions, while encouraging the White House to accept some scaled-down legislation on such measures rather than threatening to veto them. </TEXT></DOC>
