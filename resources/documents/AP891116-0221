ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. product liability law should be revised,and include the creation of a federal product liability statutethat would result in lower insurance costs and help make U.S.companies more competitive abroad, the U.S. Commerce Departmentsays.   ``The existing product liability system is in no one'sinterest,'' said Wendell Willkie II, general counsel for theCommerce Department. ``It imposes unwarranted costs and createsuncertainty for American companies, reducing their profitabilityand limiting their ability to compete effectively ...''   Willkie, in a speech at an insurance industry seminar Wednesdayin Manhattan, gave the first public statement of the Bushadministration's plans to seek an overhaul of product liabilitylaws.   During the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush said he wouldsupport federal limits on certain types of product liabilitylawsuits to cut business insurance costs.   Bush has told the Council on Competitiveness, a panel headed byVice President Dan Quayle, to propose changes in product liabilitylaws that eventually could be submitted to Congress, Willkie said.   The council, which includes officials of the Commerce, Justice,and Treasury departments, was expected to make its recommendationsearly next year.   ``The Bush administration believes the time for federal productliability legislation has arrived,'' Willkie said in his speech.   Willkie, who is working on the proposed changes, declined todiscuss any details. But he said the president has three mainobjectives in seeking a federal product liability statute:   _The restoration of fault as the standard under which anindividual can receive damages in a product liability case. Undermany state laws, a manufacturer can be held liable even if aconsumer's actions were the cause of an injury and the product wasnot defective.   _The elimination of ``deep pocket'' liability, in which adefendant with the most money can be forced to pay an entire awardeven though it was only partly responsible.   _Increased use of alternative means of settling claims, such asarbitration and mediation, to help lower the costs of productliability litigation.   Under Congress' constitutional power to regulate interstatecommerce, a federal product liability law would take precedenceover conflicting state laws.   Many state laws would remain in effect, but a law passed byCongress would ``establish federal principles that would beincorporated'' into the current state laws, Willkie said in atelephone interview after his speech.   The states still would have jurisdiction over product liabilitycases, but would be bound by federal law, he said.   In his speech, Willkie said the rising costs of insurancecoverage and litigation in product liability cases have erodedmanufacturers' profits. The higher costs have also driven up thecost of the goods American consumers buy, making foreign productsmore attractive.   Some U.S. companies also have decided against expanding orcreating new products out of fear they might one day face productliability claims, he said, citing a decision by Monsanto Corp. notto develop a substitute for asbestos because of potential suits.   ``It feared the possibility of substantial future liabilityshould the product be blamed for harm that cannot currently beidentified,'' Willkie said.   Meanwhile, ``product liability insurance costs are 15 timeshigher in the U.S. than in Japan, and product liability insurancesrates were reported in the early 1980s as averaging 20 times higherin the U.S. than in Europe,'' he said.   ``Product liability insurance costs account for up 15 percent ofthe cost of certain American-made machine tools,'' Willkie said.   Such statistics ``demonstrate that, in general, foreign productliability laws impose a far smaller relative cost burden onbusinesses than American product liability law,'' Willkie said.   His speech came at a seminar sponsored by Johnson andamp; Higgins, alarge privately-held insurance brokerage.</TEXT></DOC>
