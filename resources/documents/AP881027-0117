The outlawed IRA, in a coded message to the media, gave no reasonfor targeting Wilson Smith, 41, a postal transport manager andfather of three who police said had no connection with the securityforces.   A bomb exploded under Smith's car in a multi-story parking garageacross the road from the sorting office moments after he drovetoward the exit Wednesday evening, police said.   Fred Weir, spokesman for the Post Office Workers Union, said thekilling was ``an attack on the working class'' and could not bejustified. ``We serve both sides of the community,'' he said. ``Wedeliver to all parts of Belfast.''   In June 1987, another Post Office worker was killed in a similarcar bombing in the street outside the sorting office. NathanielCush, 47, had resigned weeks earlier from the Ulster DefenseRegiment, a predominantly Protestant auxiliary of the British army.   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to ridProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule and unite theprovince with the Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.   A policeman, 20-year-old Hugh McCrone, was killed and his partnerseriously wounded when their car was ambushed Wednesday evening nearthe village of Kinawley, 70 miles southwest of Belfast, police said.   No one has claimed responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
