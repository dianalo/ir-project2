I propose we add a new categorycalled &quot;damned statistics.&quot; Damned statistics should bereserved for any statistic by the Insurance Institute forHighway Safety, or any other self-serving insurance-industrypropaganda mechanism.   The fact is, the most reliable measurement of trafficfatalities is the number of people killed per million milesdriven. The IIHS never quotes that one. It drops every yearand is at the lowest level since transportation statisticswere first collected for motorized vehicles. The number offatalities that are reported rise in proportion to the numberof miles driven. Another statistic conveniently left out bymost of that group (IIHS and the like) is that the deaths arerising equally on highways not affected by the 65-mph speedlimit. In addition, studies have found that states that wishto keep their hands buried deeply into the pockets of theircitizenry by maintaining the preposterous 55-mph speed limit(i.e. Massachusetts) have the same average speeds on theirhighways as states with the 65-mph speed limit, despiteridiculous fines for speeding.</LP><TEXT>   Whether you wish to travel at 55 mph or 65 mph (conditionspermitting), you should know that the posted limit has had noeffect on anything other than revenues for the beneficiariesof the 55-mph speed limit. States have lost ticket revenuesand insurance companies have less excuse to raise yourpremiums due to tickets received for driving at a speeddictated by common sense, rather than arbitrary politics.
