First, the injectionof field-manufactured flue gas in a number of EOR projects is examined.Second, the possibility of recovering useful EOR gases (primarily CO/sub2/) from electric power plant flue gas is evaluated. Gas was probablythe first fluid to be injected for improved oil recovery. Lean naturalgas (methane) was the normal choice for most early injection projectsbecause the gas was often available in the field at a low cost. In afew cases when the gas supply was limited, a quantity of natural gaswas burned in air to produce much larger volumes of inexpensive ''inert''gas; these field operations were usually termed flue gas projects. Mostearly field trials failed because the combustion products in the fluegas were very corrosive and ruined the compressors in a short time. Inrecent years, however, many of the serious corrosion problems have beensolved, and successful projects have been underway for more than 20 years.Methods for combatting corrosion, reservoir interaction, and environmentalproblems are discussed with reference to current full-scale field projectsin the United States. The mechanism of oil displacement by flue gas isdiscussed briefly. It appears that oil displacement by either nitrogenor flue gas (which contains 10-12% CO/sub 2/) is very similar. Methodsfor generating flue gases, especially from coal-fired power plants, aredescribed, and the economics of the different methods are compared. Estimatesfor the cost of recovering CO/sub 2/ from existing power plants rangefrom dollar 1.25 to dollar 2.58/MCF. Costs can be lower for gas-fired,cogeneration facilities, which are located near oil fields. The environmentaladvantages of using gas instead of coal to generate electric power arementioned.
