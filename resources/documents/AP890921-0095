The proposals would regulate exchange of information on numbersand locations of forces and weapons systems of the two militarypacts over a zone stretching west from the Atlantic Ocean to theSoviet Ural mountains in the east.   Western delegation heads said their new presentation at the talkson Conventional Armed Forces in Europe completed initial NATOconcepts on curbing the possibility of non-nuclear war on thecontinent.   In earlier proposals, the 16-nation North Atlantic TreatyOrganization suggested weapons ceilings on arms categories includingcombat aircraft and helicopters, and the scrapping of all withdrawnequipment.   Chief West German delegate Ruediger Hartmann called the totalNATO package the ``most comprehensive, most detailed and mostambitious arms control system that was ever worked out forconventional forces.''   His Canadian counterpart, David Peel, told reporters, ``Now thatour package is there ... I think chances of our reaching agreementnext year are extremely good.''   Reflecting NATO confidence of quick progress, chief U.S. delegateStephen J. Ledogar said the alliance was planning to present a drafttreaty possibly before the current round of talks ends Oct. 19. Thetalks resume Nov. 10.   The new, 13-page, NATO initiative includes the followingproposals:   _Exchange of detailed information on combat and support units andair defenses to the squadron or batallion level.   _Providing the numbers and locations of main battle tanks,artillery pieces, armored troop carriers, combat aircraft and combathelicopters, as well as NATO arms depots and their Warsaw Pactequivalents.   _Information on the number and location of U.S. and Soviet troopsin allied European countries.   _Advance notification of major changes in force organization andstrength, mobilization of reservists if they number 42,000 or more,and of major movements of main battle tanks, artillery and armoredtroop carriers.   _Limits on the numbers of main battle tanks, artillery and troopcarriers in storage.   _No more than one military excercise every two years mobilizingmore than 40,000 troops or 800 main battle tanks.   _Inspection of designated bases and depots and the right to askfor inspection of non-designated ones; requests to look atnon-designated bases and depots may be refused.   _Monitoring of the destruction of withdrawn equipment.   A Warsaw Pact negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said in an interview that the new proposals ``showed promise'' butthat it was too early for substantive comment.   The seven-nation Warsaw Pact still has to formally respond to aNATO initiative presented in July.   That initiative incorporated proposals made in May by PresidentBush, including capping the U.S. and Soviet troop strengths at275,000 each and slashing the number of military aircraft.   While acknowledging general superiority in numbers, the WarsawPact disputes the accuracy of specific NATO statistics on personneland weapons.   According to November 1988 NATO statistics, Moscow and its allieshave 3,090,000 men in Europe, compared to 2,213,593 for NATO; 51,500main battle tanks to 16,424 for NATO; 22,400 armored infantryfighting vehicles to NATO's 4,153; 43,400 artillery pieces to 14,458in NATO; and 8,250 combat aircraft to 3,977 for NATO.</TEXT></DOC>
