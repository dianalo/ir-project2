Carolyn Conn, an official of the EDP Auditors Association, told aHouse panel that the majority of incidents go unreported ``becausethere is not a high expectation of successful prosecution.''   Also, she said, ``organizations do not want to publicize theirvulnerabilities when seemingly there is little or no benefit'' frompublic disclosure.   ``The costs are staggering,'' Ms. Conn told the House Judiciarysubcommittee on criminal justice. ``Viruses have cost corporations,government agencies and educational institutions millions of dollarsto prevent, detect and recover from computer virus attacks.''   The panel's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., asked herfor a estimate of the overall number of virus attacks that haveoccurred in recent years.   ``Is it tens, is it hundreds, is it thousands?'' he asked.   Ms. Conn responded: ``I think probably in the hundreds ofthousands.''   The EDP Auditors Association is a 9,000-member group ofelectronic data processing professionals based in Carol Stream,Ill., a Chicago suburb.   At the same hearing, the head of another computer industryassociation urged Congress to take a cautious approach towardlegislation intended to help fight viruses and other softwarethreats.   ``Like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s, these anti-virus billscould end up doing more harm than good,'' said John L. Pickitt,president of the Computer and Business Equipment ManufacturersAssociation.   Pickitt criticized three anti-virus bills whose chief sponsorsare Reps. Wally Herger, R-Calif., C. Thomas McMillen, D-Md., andEdward J. Markey, D-Mass.   ``Outlawing some of the programming techniques used to createcomputer viruses might prevent the use of similar programs forbeneficial purposes, including countering a virus,'' said Pickitt,chief of CBEMA, a Washington-based trade association whose membercompanies had combined sales last year of more than $230 billion.   Herger's bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prisonon people convicted of ``interfering with the operations ofcomputers through the use of programs containing hidden commandsthat can cause harm.''   The McMillen measure would punish anyone who ``willfully andknowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardwaresystem or the associated software.'' Markey's bill would make theintroduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronicnetwork a federal crime.   Computer viruses generally are small strings of computer codethat can ``infect'' legitimate computer programs and may causedestruction or alteration of data files.</TEXT></DOC>
