After the haggling of recent years over how to share oil markets, several oil ministers had looked to September as a possible historic turning point for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The idea -- initiated at June's acrimonious meeting where Kuwait joined the United Arab Emirates in openly flouting production quotas -- was that the ministers would gather quietly for 10 days to two weeks to discuss overhauling their entire system for parceling out production.    That plan seems to be unraveling, now.    The ministers had wanted to meet in Paris to try to develop a permanent system acceptable to all 13 oil exporters while ensuring them against another oil-price crash. But Paris was too crowded this year, and they've had to settle on Geneva, where their meeting begins Sept. 23.    More recently, OPEC insiders are beginning to downgrade the importance of the meeting itself.    They now stress that the Geneva session isn't a formal conference and that there aren't any immediate plans to turn it into one. It's actually a meeting of only the eight oil ministers who make up the OPEC monitoring committee, although all 13 ministers still are invited and could turn it into a special conference.    Some delegates suggest that nothing can come of the difficult launching of a new system of permanent quotas until the presidents and kings of the OPEC nations get together and decide to push it. An OPEC summit is planned. But it probably won't be held before late next year to coincide with OPEC's 30th anniversary.    A senior OPEC official confirmed that the organization's Vienna headquarters is conducting new studies on a permanent-quota system. Also, he said, a proposal will be submitted to the oil ministers when they meet in Geneva.    &quot;They will look at it,&quot; the OPEC official said, &quot;but then it will have to go to a regular conference&quot; later this year or next before there could be any action.    Although there is growing doubt that the September meeting will be able to go much beyond a preliminary discussion on a new system of long-term quotas, short-term allotments will definitely be on the agenda. OPEC insiders agreed that something has to be done now to prevent current quota cheating from getting out of hand.    So what is likely to result in September, they said, will be a higher but temporary production ceiling just for the fourth quarter and based on hopes that total output won't rise. Some OPEC members wouldn't be able to produce any more, even with higher quotas, the sources said. Also, the increases might, at this time, be disproportionate to satisfy those countries such as Kuwait that currently ignore quotas and are pushing for a new permanent system.    &quot;As a result, even if there is an increase in the quotas for the fourth quarter,&quot; said one OPEC delegate, &quot;it won't make much difference in total production.&quot;    The likely ceiling for the fourth quarter is 20 million or 20.5 million barrels a day. That compares to the current official ceiling of 19.5 million and actual production of some 21.5 million barrels a day.    That would hardly eliminate all the production cheating that goes on. But it can shrink the total amount of cheating because it makes more of the production legal, OPEC delegates noted.    OPEC sources now readily confirm outside estimates that actual output of the 13 oil exporting countries is well beyond the current production ceiling. Official production statistics released this week by OPEC's headquarters put total &quot;supplies&quot; for July for 12 of the 13 members at 18.7 million barrels a day, the highest level for the year. This figure excludes the United Arab Emirates, which is widely known for its quota cheating and is believed to be producing some 700,000 barrels a day beyond its allotment of slightly more than one million barrels a day. </TEXT></DOC>
