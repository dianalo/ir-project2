TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The army said soldiers shot and wounded sevenArabs in a clash today, and Arab residents said troops closed oneof the West Bank's largest food markets as Israel stepped upeconomic sanctions against the occupied territories.   Arab reports said 150 Arab policemen in Gaza announced theirintention to quit, joining hundreds of officers who have turned intheir badges in the West Bank. Israeli authorities acknowledgedsome resignations but gave no number.   The resignations followed the slaying of a Jericho policeman whowas accused of collaborating with the Israelis. Undergound PLOleaflets have demanded Arabs stop working for Israeli occupationauthorities.   Scores of tax collectors resigned earlier.   An army spokeswoman said a violent demonstration took place inYamoun, six miles northwest of Jenin. She said soldiers fired atthe legs of demonstrators because the troops believed their liveswere in danger. Seven Arabs were wounded and the village was placedunder curfew, she said.   The Palestine Press Service reported 12 Arabs were shot inclashes with soldiers, 10 in Yamoun and two others in Jenin.Hospital officials declined comment, citing a newly enforced armyban on speaking to reporters.   The United Nations says at least 91 Palestinians have beenkilled since anti-Israeli rioting began Dec. 8 in the occupiedterritories.   In apparent response to the resignation campaign, Israelcontinued its economic sanctions, including a ban on the shipmentof gasoline and other fuel to service stations in the West Bank.   Uri Hakak of the Israeli-owned Padesco Co., which supplies fuelto 50 West Bank gas stations, said drivers were afraid to makedeliveries after two tank trucks had been attacked and burned.   ``A truck carrying 20,000 liters (5,000 gallons) of oil is likea napalm bomb. The drivers are afraid to travel,'' he said.   Soldiers closed the regional fruit and vegetable market inJericho, 22 miles northeast of Jerusalem. Arab merchants said 70trucks carrying tomatoes, peppers, cauliflower, lemons, oranges andapples were turned away.   ``We started to sell about 8 a.m. when the soldiers came andforced us to close,'' said one merchant, who was sitting next tocrates of fruit covered with tarpaulins and carpets.   The merchant said Arab farmers drove to other areas of town andtried to set up informal markets. But he said soldiers chased themaway.   Saeb Erakat, a Najah University political science professor wholives in Jericho, said Israeli authorities wanted to break the backof the Palestinian strike with economic pressure.   ``The military government is trying to tell the people who isboss. They want to hurt the people economically. Jericho is anagricultural city. To order the market closed in the morningamounts to killing it economically,'' said Erakat.   A senior official in the army-run territorial government saidthere had been a ``shift in focus'' from the disturbances in thestreets to civil disobedience.   ``In this context, maybe we are going to take some steps (inresponse) to the economic steps they take,'' added the official,who spoke on condition of anonymity   A dozen heads of Arab chambers of commerce from throughout theoccupied territories met in Jerusalem. They called for a halt to``all methods of collective punishment and the withdrawal of theIsraeli army from the cities and population centers.''   They also demanded an end to ``attacks on shopowners and theirshops.''   An Arab Chamber of Commerce official who insisted on anonymitysaid the ban on fuels means Palestinianss will have difficultyrestocking their heating tanks, that bakeries will have troublebaking bread and that farmers will not have fuel for the irrigationpumps.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, arrived in Washingtonfor an eight-day visit and said he is ``always open to new andconstructive proposals,'' to bring peace to the Middle East.   Shamir, who opposes a U.S. peace plan for the region, said hewill give the Reagan administration a qualified reply to theAmerican proposal to hold peace talks by May 1.</TEXT></DOC>
