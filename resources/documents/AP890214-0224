John J. Cloherty, a spokesman for the FBI's Boston office, saidthe probe was launched within the past week, but he declined to saywhat information led the bureau to initiate an investigation.   Leading Edge's legal problems mounted Monday when six computerdealers filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court claiming they paida total of $779,000 in advance for Leading Edge computers they neverreceived.   Dealers said they agreed to the advance payment, an unusualpractice in the industry, because of the large demand for thecomputers.   The Canton company pioneered the market for low-priced IBMpersonal computer clones. But it stopped delivering computers lastmonth.   The dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking tofreeze Leading Edge's assets pending an examination of the company'sfinances and business dealings. The company reportedly owes dealersmore than $10 million.   Leading Edge spokesman David Rottenberg said the dealers'complaints and the company's debts would be addressed by the plannedsale of Leading Edge to one of its dealers, PC Systems of RivieraBeach, Fla.   The sale, however, has been blocked temporarily by a court orderbecause of an unrelated lawsuit over software royalties filed by aformer Leading Edge employee, Rottenberg said.   PC Systems had agreed to supply computers and assume LeadingEdge's debts in return for the company's valuable trademark,Rottenberg said.   Earlier this month, 50 Leading Edge dealers met in Chicago toconsider the PC Systems sale.   Larry Stone, president of OmniTek Computers Inc. of Portland,Ore., who organized the meeting, said Leading Edge owes him$190,000. Stone said he decided to sign the bankruptcy petition when``it became pretty apparent the action was going to proceed with orwithout me.''</TEXT></DOC>
