Ten houses were selected for monitoring, five where new insulationwas being installed, and five where existing insulation was being disturbed.The samples were analyzed by either phase contrast optical microscopy(PCOM) or by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In new houses, the levelsof mineral wool were approximately 0.01 fibers/ml and, in the old houses,the levels were generally not detectable, i.e., less than 0.005 fibers/ml.Within 24 hours of insulation or disturbance of mineral wool the concentrationof airborne MMMF was at or below the detection limit of 0.005 fibers/ml.Background levels from pooled data or high-volume samples indicated thatactual levels were about 0.0002 fibers/ml or less.</TEXT></DOC>
