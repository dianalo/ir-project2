Ueberroth, former commissioner of major league baseball, was appointed to the supervisory board of Adidas AG, the West German sports-shoe and apparel maker.    Mr. Ueberroth will also join the boards of Adidas subsidiaries in the U.S., the company said. As a member of the 12-member supervisory board of the closely held company, Mr. Ueberroth will oversee the company's international sneaker and athletic-wear operations.    The company also said Mr. Ueberroth has acquired options for a &quot;substantial stake&quot; in its U.S. operations and a minority share in Adidas AG, which can be exercised by an increase in the number of company shares.    The five children of the company's founder, Adolf Dassler, hold a majority interest in Adidas. Group sales in 1988 fell 5%, to 3.15 billion marks ($1.71 billion) from 3.32 billion marks in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
