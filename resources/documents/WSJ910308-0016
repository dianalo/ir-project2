Battered in the past 15 months by a coup attempt, floods,typhoons and an earthquake, business has been furtherpummeled this year by the world-wide travel slump followingthe start of the war in the Persian Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   The traditional peak season through the Chinese Lunar NewYear was more of a trough. A spate of new and refurbishedhotel rooms in Manila is coming at a time when low occupancyis causing layoffs and cutbacks at existing hotels.Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, has been forced toreduce staff hours and cancel flights for want of passengers.   The industry's troubles also have hampered thegovernment's privatization efforts for the carrier andhotels, while tourism officials say their morale has sufferedfrom the planned merger of their agency with the morepowerful Department of Trade and Industry.   Hotel and resort owners say business in the first sevenweeks of 1991 was even worse than the year-earlier period,when occupancies hit record lows after a December 1989insurrection, which trapped hundreds of visiting foreignersin the Makati business district while fighting raged in thestreets. Some investors believe that real growth in tourismwon't materialize until after presidential elections in May1992.   According to the Department of Tourism, the number oftourists visiting the country fell to about one million in1990 from a record 1.2 million the year before.   Industry analysts had hoped that the 1989 surge inarrivals -- up 15% from the year before -- signaled the startof a tourism takeoff. Their hopes have been bitterlydisappointed. Hotel managers estimate that about a quarter ofcurrent arrivals listed as tourists are overseas Filipinos,who generally stay with relatives and spend less thanconventional tourists.   Even at these low levels, tourism employs more than amillion people nationwide and is the country's No. 3foreign-exchange earner after textile and electronic exports,tourism officials say. The Tourism Department estimates thatindustry receipts totaled $1.25 billion in 1990, down from$1.47 billion in 1989. In 1991, arrivals and receipts areprojected to fall by a further 2.7%, officials say.   Tour operators who normally look to the Chinese Lunar NewYear for the bulk of their business from Hong Kong andSoutheast Asia reported cancellation rates of up to 90% forthe mid-February holiday period.   General anxiety over the Gulf war and a botched bombingattempt of a U.S. library in Makati, in which one Iraqi waskilled and another seriously injured, were blamed for thedisastrous season.   Citing lack of business, Philippine Airlines has canceled18% of its domestic flights through the end of March, andtravelers complain that even the remaining scheduled flightssometimes fail to depart due to lack of passengers. Theairline has put about 12,000 employees on a four-dayworkweek.   Yet despite the vacant rooms and canceled flights,investors and government officials are continuing to lay thegroundwork for what they believe to be a long-overduerecovery in tourism.   In several districts in the capital -- sometimes in theshadow of half-empty hotels -- bigger, classier andmore-expensive new hotels begun during the brief boom afterPresident Corazon Aquino came to power in 1986 are graduallytaking shape.   Hotels that were built during the mid-1970s boom anddeteriorated in a subsequent slump have recently beenrefurbished. Officials say that about 3,000 rooms nationwidewere refitted under a two-year program that allowed duty-freeimport of materials used in upgrading tourist facilities.   The recent building activity, however, reflects earliercommitments. New investments in tourism fell sharply in 1990.According to the government's Board of Investment, newlyapproved tourism projects totaled 9.52 billion pesos ($343.4million) in 1990, down from 20 billion pesos the previousyear.   With occupancy rates down and new hotels nearingcompletion, the government will have to accept lower pricesfor hotels it is trying to sell under a slow-movingprivatization program. Sale of the hotels, which were seizedby state banks for nonpayment of loans during the economiccrisis that accompanied the final years of PresidentFerdinand Marcos's rule, was to have been a key element inthe government plan to boost efficiency in the tourismindustry.   Privatization of Philippine Airlines also is behindschedule, despite pressure from tourism officials andbusinessmen who argue that a privatized airline and anopen-skies policy giving foreign carriers access toprovincial airports would be a shot in the arm for tourism.   Feliciano Belmonte Jr., who is concurrently president ofthe government insurance agency and chairman of PhilippineAirlines, has said that 60% of the airline will be sold byAugust, including 35% that will be offered to foreigners.Observers question, however, whether the sale will push aheadin the current depressed climate.   Tourism officials working against these odds to promotethe industry say their morale has been sapped by plans tomerge the department with the larger, more powerfulDepartment of Trade and Industry.   As part of the reorganization plan announced by Mrs.Aquino in December, Peter Garrucho, then-secretary oftourism, was named secretary of trade and industry andinstructed to draw up a plan for the merger.   Mr. Garucho himself says he is uncertain about the mergerand suggests that it might not take place, because thereorganization plan he is drafting will have to be approvedby Congress.   &quot;The fear is that if you add tourism as just anotherproduct, you will lose out on a sector that is already amajor dollar earner,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
