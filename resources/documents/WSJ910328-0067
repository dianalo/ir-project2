The smokes promise to have thesame flavor as ordinary cigarettes, but with almost noaddictive nicotine. Philip Morris is the first tobacco giantout of the gate, testing a de-nicotined version of Next inTampa, as well as the Benson andamp; Hedges entry in Arizona. Onead boasts that Benson andamp; Hedges has &quot;unlocked the secret&quot; tode-nicotined tobacco.</LP><TEXT>   But critics already are lining up to take shots at the newniche, contending that tobacco companies are makingunsubstantiated health claims. The new brands and their ads&quot;are clearly designed to let consumers think the product isless addictive or not addictive,&quot; says Scott Ballin, vicepresident of public affairs for the American HeartAssociation. As such, he argues, de-nicotined cigarettesshould be classified as drugs and regulated by the Food andDrug Administration -- a fate from which tobacco productscurrently are exempt.   The Heart Association and several other groups plan topetition the FDA in the next two weeks, asking that thelow-nicotine smokes be classified as drugs. That distinctionwould be a potentially devastating one for tobacco companies,forcing them to offer scientific proof if the FDA rules theirads are positioning the new product as a healthieralternative.   Health groups tried a similar move in 1988 when they urgedthe FDA to regulate R.J. Reynolds's new smokeless cigarette,Premier, as well as low-tar brands such as American Brands'sCarlton. Those cigarettes' ads implied &quot;that a healthbenefit, or a risk reduction, can be obtained by smoking&quot;them, one petition said. The FDA never ruled on the matter;Premier was ultimately withdrawn from the market forunrelated reasons.   Philip Morris insists it isn't making health claims atall. The tobacco giant simply is searching for a new niche, aspokesman says. &quot;There's no implied health claim in any ofour products,&quot; he says. Some smokers may prefer de-nicotinedtobacco, he says, &quot;just as some consumers preferdecaffeinated coffee.&quot;   The Philip Morris spokesman also says the FDA shouldn'tget involved in tobacco regulation because cigarettes &quot;arethe most highly regulated consumer product in the country.Adding another regulatory agency is a little silly.&quot; Besides,he says, the FDA has &quot;trouble reviewing the things they'realready responsible for. They're already overburdened.&quot;   The de-nicotine debate may be a moot one if the new smokesdon't sell, which many industry executives believe may turnout to be the case. Nicotine, after all, is addictive, andsmokers may well shun a product without it. The Philip Morrisspokesman says the company is &quot;satisfied with the results todate,&quot; but &quot;we're continuing to look at different productsand permutations in the advertising and the taste.&quot;   Industry critics' chances of persuading the FDA toclassify tobacco as a drug are slim, considering the clout ofthe tobacco industry and the FDA's reluctance to take actionso far. But they, nevertheless, are encouraged by the FDA'scrackdown in recent years on health claims in foodadvertising.   Since the FDA finally started reining in food companies,candy bars and donuts made with a dash of oat bran rarelyadvertise themselves as health foods anymore. General Millsdiscontinued its Benefit cereal after the FDA questionedcholesterol-lowering claims about the &quot;active ingredient&quot;psyllium. The de-nicotined tobacco ads, in the critics' view,fall into the same category.   &quot;Nicotine doesn't have to do with flavor or image; it hasto do with physiological alteration,&quot; contends Edward Popper,a professor of marketing at Bryant College in Smithfield,R.I. &quot;When you're talking about less nicotine, you are infact making a health claim.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
