The leaders met at the White House for an hour to discuss theirdifferences over the acid rain pollution problem, but ``nobodytried to bridge'' the disagreements, a senior U.S. official said.   The official said that during a half-hour private sessionMulroney presented some new ideas on the issue, but furtherdiscussions between experts will be required before it can bedetermined if the proposals are palatable to the United States.   The Canadian government is considering the purchase of 10 or 12nuclear-powered attack submarines, either from Britain or France.Since the British ``Trafalgar'' class subs use American powerplants, U.S. permission will be required if the Canadians pick theBritish design.   The official said Reagan informed Mulroney that he would approvethe technology transfer _ making Canada the first nation outsideBritain to be eligible to acquire the technology.   Congressional approval also is necessary.   Mulroney, with Reagan standing beside him at a welcomingceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, reminded thepresident that they had pledged during a meeting in Canada to worktogether on the acid rain problem.   ``This, as you said in Quebec City, Mr. President, is a problemthat belongs to both of us. We must continue and we shall to worktogether for an equitable solution to this important challenge,''Mulroney said.   Reagan, in his welcoming remarks, asserted that progress hadbeen made in improving air quality.   Smoke from cannons that boomed out a salute wafted over theWhite House grounds as Mulroney stood at Reagan's side.   Reagan said the agreement would lead to an ``unshackling'' ofU.S.-Canadian trading relations.   ``I'm confident that the legislatures of both countries willvote favorably on this historic free trade agreement,'' Reagan said.   Mulroney was quoted last week as saying that U.S. acid rainemissions are similar to the United States' ``dumping garbage inCanada.''   Asked at a brief photo opportunity before his meeting withReagan if he stood by the comment, Mulroney said:   ``I think it is very clear. The acid rain has that effect in theeastern United States and Canada. Yes, I think that's a normalfact.''   On Friday, the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymitysaid it was unlikely the two countries would reach an accord onacid rain by Jan. 20 when the Reagan administration leaves office.The official said: ``No, I don't. It is a difference in approach.''   Canada wants the United States to set specific targets andtimetables for the reduction of emissions causing acid rain. TheU.S. official insisted that scientists have not yet discovered away to judge the success of such an effort.   ``If you are going to put a lot of money into something, you hadbetter make sure you have the right technology,'' the officialsaid. ``You had better know there is a direct relationship betweenwhat you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from.''   Asked if the Reagan administration is concerned about the costof a cleanup, the official said, ``It is too dear if you are usingthe wrong technologies and when you get all done you haven't solvedthe Canada problem. People are just simply very reluctant to say,`Here we go full tilt,' and when you get done you haven't solvedthe problem as it addresses itself in the U.S.-Canadianrelationship.''   Underscoring the differences, U.S. diplomats negotiating inGeneva on an international pollution agreement this week demanded aright for the United States to emit 20 percent more of a keyprecursor of acid rain than it produced last year. This allowancewould be in the form of credits for the achievements of U.S.control progams in place since 1975, which have reduced nitrogenoxide emissions 8.5 percent since the peak year of 1978.   Canada had agreed to a draft that would have permitted increasesin U.S. nitrogen oxide emissions as long as they did not result inincreases of the pollutant moving into Canada, said Sheldon Meyers,acting associate administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency for international programs.   Meyers said the United States told Canada it did not believenorthbound flows of nitrogen oxides could even be measured and,``There's no way we could agree'' to such a provision in light ofprojected increases in U.S. emissions.   Although most attention has been focused on sulfur oxidesemitted by coal-burning power plants and other sources, nitrogenoxides emitted by those plants, by motor vehicles and by othersources are believed to generate a third of the extra acidity ofacid rain in the eastern United States and Canada.   The Reagan administration has generally adopted the line thatmore research is needed. Northeastern states, which like Canadahave noticed damage to their forests and lakes, have sided withtheir northern neighbor in calling for tough limits on pollutantsfrom coal-burning plants and other sources of acid-causingemissions.   Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, NewYork, Pennsylvania and New Jersey are suing the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, seeking new emission controls similar to thosesought by Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
