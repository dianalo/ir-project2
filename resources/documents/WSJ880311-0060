The overhaul may well boil down to somewhat lower income taxes financed by soaring government revenues. Many analysts believe Mr. Lawson will slash taxes as much as #4 billion ($7.38 billion) by reducing personal income-tax rates, currently between 27% and 60%, and reducing the number of tax brackets. By tradition, tax changes for the financial year starting April 1 are secret until the chancellor reveals them to Parliament.    The tax cuts, prematurely hailed as tax reform by analysts and academics, seem likely to be financed by Britain's roaring economic expansion. Thanks to surging personal and corporate earnings, Treasury coffers overflow with an estimated extra #10 billion. Using this revenue bonanza to give Britons some of their money back, Mr. Lawson will have enough left to create Britain's first budget surplus in years.    The country's surging growth has driven the earnings of large numbers of taxpayers into higher tax brackets -- so-called bracket creep. If Mr. Lawson didn't cut taxes, he would be squeezing the economy with a more restrictive fiscal policy. In effect, he would be raising taxes.    Bracket creep has caused taxpayers' deductions -- called allowances in Britain -- to lag behind income growth, providing the cash to cover Mr. Lawson's tax-cutting check. &quot;The bill is being paid by allowances not going up in line with earnings,&quot; says Christopher Johnson, chief economic adviser of Lloyds Bank PLC. United Kingdom tax allowances are indexed to inflation, but don't reflect real increases in earnings.    &quot;Rate reduction isn't tax reform,&quot; says Charles Mclure, a fellow of the Hoover Institution, a California think tank. Mr. Mclure also was architect of the U.S. Treasury's first tax reform blueprint in 1984. &quot;But I would argue reducing those high top rates is worthwhile.&quot;    However Britain finances the cuts, the country is ripe for deeper income-tax reduction than Mr. Lawson may envision, says Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics, a U.S. supply-side research firm. In a recent letter to London's Financial Times, he estimated a taxpayer earning the equivalent of $28,000 a year pays a marginal tax rate of 60% in Britain, 45% in France, 32% in West Germany and 31% in the U.S. Yet Britain's budget surplus is in market contrast to the massive U.S. deficit, which has soared since supply-side policies gained credence there. (Marginal taxes describe the effective rate levied after all direct taxes, including social security, are included.)    It's also probable that Mr. Lawson actually won't reduce individuals' tax burden that much. Instead, the chancellor is expected to raise indirect taxes on tobacco, alcohol and gasoline and possibly extend the value-added tax, a general tax on many goods and services, to cover newspapers and books.    And unlike tax reform in other Western nations, Mr. Lawson isn't expected to widen the tax base by broadly closing loopholes. &quot;It seems to me Britain has a long way to go to broaden the tax base like the U.S. has done,&quot; says Joseph Pechman, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.    But Britain doesn't offer as many tax shelters as the U.S. did before its 1986 tax reform. &quot;There isn't quite so much undergrowth to be cleared,&quot; notes Lloyds Bank's Mr. Johnson. In addition, Mr. Lawson's 1984 corporate-tax reform actually reduced tax rates and closed many shelters, too.    The most expensive deductions for the U.K. government are allowances for married men and single people, which will return an estimated #23.3 billion to taxpayers in the tax year ending April 5. These deductions could become even costlier to the Treasury if, as anticipated, Mr. Lawson introduces a multiyear reform of the taxation of husbands and wives. A possible curb on another deduction, mortgage-interest payments, is the only way the chancellor may broaden the tax base. </TEXT></DOC>
