Two months after the situation was discovered, Bradley startedearning $18,000 a year as a consultant to the bank, the Los AngelesHerald Examiner reported.   Bradley's ties to Far East National Bank and anotherinstitution, Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association, haveprompted an investigation by the city attorney's office and PoliceDepartment into conflict-of-interest allegations and spawned theformation of a city ethics panel.   The panel of seven civic and religious leaders, appointed byBradley one day after his narrow re-election April 11, met for thefirst time Monday and sought to distance itself from the mayor andthe City Council.   The panel agreed to organize as an independent organization,probably as a nonprofit corporation, and not take any funds fromBradley, his political action committee or the City Council.   ``We will be most effective, most credible ... if we areindependent,'' said Geoffrey Cowan, former state chairman of thepolitical watchdog group Common Cause. Cowan was asked by Bradleyto head the panel.   According to records obtained by the Herald Examiner, Bradleyauthorized the Far East bank account and his top aide, AntonCalleia, controlled deposits made to the account by the federalgovernment in 1987.   On Aug. 4, 1987, $600,000 in federal transportation funds weredeposited in the account, and on Oct. 31, 1987, $789,230 was added,records show.   It was not until Nov. 9, 1987 that the city treasurer's officediscovered Far East held nearly $1.4 million in city funds andordered the bank to return the money to the city, the HeraldExaminer reported.   The money should have been transferred to the city treasurywithin a day or two, said William Hoss, the city treasurer's cashmanagement and investment officer.   A spokesman for the federal Urban Mass Transit Administration,which sent the money to the city, said the deposit may haveviolated federal regulations because money from federal grants mustbe spent promptly. The spokesman asked not to be identified.   Phone calls to Calleia's office for comment were not returned.Bradley has refused to comment on his ties to the financialinstitutions pending the outcome of the city attorney'sinvestigation.   The mayor has denied knowing the city was doing business withthe bank in 1988 at a time Far East was paying him $18,000 a yearto act as a consultant. The mayor returned the $18,000 after thematter was made public.</TEXT></DOC>
