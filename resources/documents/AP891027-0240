(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Towering above this industrial enclavealong the Thames River, a 386-foot smokestack rises from thehulking steel and concrete shell of a coal-burning power plantunder construction.   The owners, Applied Energy Services of Arlington, Va., and evenenvironmentalists, say the $275 million plant could set thestandard for the environmentally sound production of electricity inthe future.   The plant will burn about 2,000 tons of coal a day when itbegins operating in November, relying on a combination of newtechnology and new ideas to limit pollution and offset the plant'scontributions to the greenhouse effect.   The most novel of the ideas is Applied Energy's decision tospend $2 million to plant 52 million trees in Guatemala in areforestation project run by CARE, an international relief anddevelopment organization.   The trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide _ which scientistsblame as the main culprit in global warming _ to compensate for the1.4 million tons the plant will generate during its 40 years inoperation, the company says.   ``AES is setting the pace and helping to determine how their ownindustry will be regulated in the future. They've shaped thedebate,'' said Paul Faeth of the World Resources Institute, aWashington-based environmental research group working with AppliedEnergy on the reforestation project.   Other utilities have expressed interest in similar projects,Faeth said.   Daniel Dudeck of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, whofavors requiring new carbon dioxide producers to compensate fortheir emissions, said Applied Energy is demonstrating thefeasibilty of such policies.   Especially important, environmentalists say, is that the companyis proof that private enterprise can take extraordinary steps toprotect the environment and remain economically viable, and evenprofitable.   Applied Energy's stock has climbed from $2 to $135 during itseight years in operation. The plant here is its fourth. Revenuesduring the past year were about $100 million; when this plant andanother under construction are running, the company expectsrevenues of about $400 million.   ``It's their whole corporate ethos. They want to make money inthe best way, environmentally speaking. They want, as much as istechnologically feasible, to build an environmentally benign powerplant,'' Faeth said.   ``In making electricity, you've got a process that pollutes. Ourobjective was to see what we could do to minimize all types ofpollution coming from the plant,'' said Dan Rothaupt, the plantengineer.   To keep sulfur dioxide, part of acid rain, out of the emissions,limestone will be burned with the coal. A reaction between thecalcium carbonate and the sulfur in the coal forms calcium sulfate,a harmless solid. To accomplish this, the plant uses a newtechnology, the circulating fluidized bed boiler.   The boiler, a steel-encased tower 110 feet high, lets operatorsmaintain a temperature high enough to maximize the chemicalreaction between the coal and limestone but low enough not tocreate many nitrogen oxides, another pollutant.   The calcium sulfate and ash will be shipped back to WestVirginia's coal fields where it will be used to reclaim landscarred by strip mining.   The process will remove 90 percent of the sulfur that goes intothe boiler and produce about half the nitrogen oxides allowed byfederal law. The plant will generate 180 megawatts of electricityand sell steam to a paper mill.   ``Profits aren't really the ultimate goal for us. It's being agood neighbor, being a good citizen,'' said company PresidentDennis Bakke, who founded Applied Energy with Roger Sant, nowchairman, his former boss in the Federal Energy Administration'senvironmental and conservation efforts.   ``We try to weigh that responsibility with trying to deliver aproduct to our customers which meets their needs.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
