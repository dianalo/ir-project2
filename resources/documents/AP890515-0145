Opposition parties called Monday for a parliamentary inquiry todispel doubts about the death of Lee Chol-kyu, whose body was foundWednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju.   Students and dissidents allege that Lee, 24, was tortured andkilled by police.   Witnesses said 10,000 demonstrators marched through Kwangjuafter a campus rally against President Roh Tae-woo that was joinedby professors at Chosun University.   Scuffles erupted when the protesters, yelling ``Down with RohTae-woo!'' tried to force their way past police lines to reach theprovincial government headquarters, witnesses said.   But riot police wielded shields and truncheons to disperse theprotesters. No injuries or arrests were reported.   In Seoul, about 300 radical student leaders began a four-dayhunger strike Monday, demanding a full and independentinvestigation.   Students threatened to stage nationwide protests, beginningThursday, unless they get a full explanation of Lee's death.   They accused authorities of distorting pathology tests.   Doctors reported Sunday finding ``a lot of plankton'' in Lee'sintestines. ``The findings indisputably indicate that the studentdied by drowning,'' said Yoon Joong-jin, director of the NationalInstitute of Scientific Investigation.   Yoon said independent medical college professors and oppositionlawmakers witnessed the tests. Doctors also have said an autopsyshowed no sign of torture.   Hundreds of posters rejecting the findings were plastered onnotice boards of buildings in Kwangju, which Thursday marks theanniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in which 200 civilians werekilled.   Thousands of students and citizens in Kwangju have staged dailyprotests against Roh's government since Lee's body was found. Thestudent had been sought by police for anti-government activities.   Lee's death comes as authorities step up a crackdown ondissidents. About 230 radical students and dissidents have beenarrested since early April.   Government officials accused dissidents of trying to use Lee'sdeath as a rallying point for their anti-government campaign, whichhas failed to gain public support because of their extreme viewsand violence.</TEXT></DOC>
