Riot squads with whips, tear gas and shotguns dispersed blacksprotesting their exclusion from the balloting, and police said morethan 50 people were arrested. Anti-apartheid leaders, who called ageneral strike, said 3 million people stayed away from jobs andclasses.   It appeared, with just four of 166 districts undecided, that theNational Party would retain 93 or 94 of its previous 123 seats. Thefar-right Conservative Party improved from 22 to 39 seats and theliberal Democratic Party moved from 20 to 33 seats, the most everfor an anti-apartheid faction.   With his party narrowly retaining its majority in Parliament,National Party leader and acting President F.W. de Klerk is expectedto be chosen by an electoral college next week to serve a five-yearterm as president.   He described the results as ``a clear mandate'' for his party'splans for gradual political reform and contended that bothopposition parties had little chance for further growth.   Independent commentators said it was the first time since 1953that the National Party failed to get a majority of the popularvote. The Nationalists won about 48 percent of the vote, to 31percent for the Conservatives and 21 percent for the Democrats.   About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters turnedout for the election.   The Conservatives, who favor stricter racial segregation, lost byjust five votes in Vereeniging, former district of de Klerk, who wasnot a parliamentary candidate.   Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan werere-elected by margins sharply lower than in the white election of1987. The Conservatives won their first-ever seats in Pretoria, thecapital, and in Cape Province and the Orange Free State.   The election was widely viewed as among the most important inhistory for the whites who control South Africa. It gave whitevoters the choice of stating that they want to strengthen apartheid,eliminate it or take a middle course.   The amount of support for the other parties was expected toinfluence the National Party in deciding whether to speed up or slowdown its program of limited political reform.   Voting stations around the country were heavily guarded. Armoredvehicles patrolled some mixed-race townships, which were envelopedin smoke from burning street barricades.   Also at stake were seats in mixed-race and Indian chambers, whichwere established in 1984 and have little power. Blacks, whooutnumber whites more than 5-1, have no voice in national affairs.   Anti-apartheid activists called for a boycott of the non-whiteelections.   Of the nation's 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million ofIndian descent.   The campaign platform of de Klerk called for limited blackparticipation at the national level within five years.   He is depicted as more flexible than his predecessor, PresidentP.W. Botha, but supports segregation of schools and neighborhoodsand rejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majorityrule.   The Conservative Party opposes political concessions to blacksand favors comprehensive racial segregation. The Democratic Partywants an immediate end to segregation and a vote of equal weight forevery South African.   In the five weeks before the election, anti-apartheid groupsmounted an unprecedented defiance campaign, in many cases provokingviolent response by police.   Riot squads have used shotguns, water cannons, tear gas, clubsand dogs against anti-election marches, campus rallies and churchmeetings. More than 2,000 people have been arrested for disobeyinglaws that segregate hospitals, beaches and buses, and for defyingrestrictions on speech and political activity.   Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop and anti-apartheidleader, said of the election: ``I'm not paying a great deal ofattention. I'm more interested in how many people stay away.   ``I would hope that white South Africans would be aware that thebulk of the people in this country are not voting, and they shouldjoin us in getting rid of the system.''   Black worker absenteeism ranged from about 70 percent in theindustrial heartland around Pretoria and Johannesburg to virtually100 percent in the eastern Cape province cities of Port Elizabethand Uitenhage, labor experts at Johannesburg's University of theWitwatersrand reported. Most mines operated normally, but all motorvehicle plants were shut down.   Officials said registered voters included 665,870 Indians and1.77 million people of mixed race.</TEXT></DOC>
