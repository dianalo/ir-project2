In last week's tally, the rig count dropped by five to total940. A year ago this week, the count was 1,012, the company saidMonday.   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plungedto less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and therig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughesbegan compiling figures.   Among major oil producing states Oklahoma posted the biggestgain for the week with 10 additional working rigs, followed byTexas with a gain of three and California, Kansas and North Dakotawith one each.   New Mexico led declines for the second straight week with 11,followed by Louisiana, nine; Wyoming, six; Michigan, five; Ohio,two; and Colorado, one. Pennsylvania's total was unchanged for theweek.</TEXT></DOC>
