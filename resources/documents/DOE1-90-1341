Experimental data are obtained by wide-angle(14x32 deg) electrostatic analyser oriented by space probe velocity vectorrelatively the comet. Ion energy spectra were measured every second in120 logarithmically arranged energy intervals in the 15-3500 eV/Q (Q-chargenumber) energy range with energy resolution {Delta}E/E=0.055. Possiblecauses of quasiperiodic modulation of heavy ion concentration with theperiod of 10 c observed in comet plasma are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
