The study, by the Resolution Trust Corp.'s investigationsbranch, could be bad news for government-securities dealerstrying to fend off members of Congress looking to bring newlayers of oversight to the industry.</LP><TEXT>   The report focuses on the role of government securities in37 of the 576 Sandamp;Ls that have been taken over by thegovernment. Many of the failures are being examined by thriftofficials for possible fraud by Sandamp;L management or violationsby brokerage firms that sold the securities.   The RTC didn't identify either the thrifts or thebrokerage houses in question. But the agency offered aglimpse into some startling displays of incompetence bythrift managers of government-securities portfolios, as wellas some cases that appear to raise legal questions.   The study's findings give new ammunition to congressionalleaders pushing to impose a new set of rules ongovernment-securities brokers. Later this year, Congress isexpected to reapprove the five-year-old Government SecuritiesAct, which sets standards for the industry. But the actspecifically omits brokerage-house sales practices, and somein Congress want to change that this year. One contemplatedchange would require brokers to be certain that investmentsare matched to a customer's sophistication.   The Public Securities Association, which hadn't backed anysteps to clamp down on brokers, recently relaxed its stanceand now is willing to support limited restraints. But thetrade group cautions that investment decisions byinstitutional investors such as thrifts or municipalitiesshould remain the responsibility of the buyer, not theseller. &quot;We're happy to support reasonable rules,&quot; saidFrances Bermanzohn, the PSA's general counsel. &quot;But to makebroker-dealers into insurers against institutional clients'losses would be unreasonable.&quot;   But others think the report points to the need for moreoversight. &quot;The time is clearly ripe for Congress to closelyexamine the goverment-securities market,&quot; said Rep. EdwardMarkey (D., Mass.), who heads the House Telecommunicationsand Finance Subcommittee, which is holding a hearing on thetopic this morning. &quot;The RTC report throws a mass of smokeonto this market and it stretches credibility to suggest thatwhere there is this much smoke there is no fire.&quot;   Some thrifts failed after posting government-securitiestrading losses of up to $200 million. Others lost far smalleramounts, but were forced into insolvency as hedges on bets onrising government-securities prices went sour at the wrongtime.   But the examples that may cause the most squirming amongsecurities dealers are those that show apparently heinousactivities by brokers. For example, one thrift with assets of$129 million used a &quot;mid-South&quot; brokerage firm to place muchof its assets in long-term government bonds. During the timewhen the institution's net worth totaled $3 million, the Sandamp;Lhad losses of $3.6 million on the $33 million of bonds itowned.   Not only did the trading have &quot;a material impact on theinstitution's demise,&quot; according to the RTC, but it also hastriggered an agency and Federal Bureau of Investigationinquiry into the relationship between the thrift's president,who oversaw the trading, and the broker.   Possibly the most intriguing example is that of a $167.9million asset thrift with an estimated government-securitiesloss of $16.6 million. The RTC says the thrift had losses of$7.8 million on financial-futures options and $8.8 million onmortgage-backed securities, bought through seven majorbrokerage firms.   The RTC says it hasn't made a determination aboutimpropriety, but said it &quot;appears that at least a portion ofthe losses might be attributed to placement of unsuitableinvestments.&quot; The agency noted that the spouse of the Sandamp;L'schairman and major shareholder was a broker for three of thebrokerage firms that dealt with the institution between 1985and 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
