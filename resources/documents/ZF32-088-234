 Born in 1967 as the American Standard Code for InformationInterchange, ASCII was supposed to save the world from being locked intoIBM's then-proprietary Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code(EBCDIC).andM;At the ripe old age of 24, ASCII is positively ancient compared with mostcomputer technologies.andP;  It has survived for so long because it is both simpleand predictable: an unaambiguous, 256 character, 8-bit fixed-length code witha well-organized and apparently numerous character set.andM;In recent years, however, ASCII has been showing its age and its limitations.andO;Global computing becomes a whole lot more difficult when limited to a mere256 characters.andP;  And that old 8-bit standard is holding back several hardwareand software vendors that are looking for ways to enter majaor markets inAsia, where text comprises thousands of characters--not just the ABCs.andM;In fact, ASCII's biggest drawback is embodies in its name: American, ASCIIcan't begin to provide all the characters needed for information processingin Western Europe, not to mention Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the SovietUnion.andM;This month, a Mountain View, Calif.-based consortium of major computercompanies, formally known as Unicode Inc., are mounting a challenge to ASCII.andO;They plan to announce Unicode, a new and much more powerful multilingual textand character encoding standard, which will provide an international computercode for storage and transmission of text.andM;Think of Unicode as double-width global ASCII.andM;Unicode will establish an unambiguous, fixed 16-bit  codeset.andP;  Since Unicodeknows no country, no 7-to-8 bit shifting or code-type communicationannouncement mechanism will be required when transmitting or receiving codedtext.andM;Major contributors to Unicode's development include Apple Computer Inc., GoCorp., IBM, Metaphor Computer Systems Inc., Next Inc., The Research LibrariesGroup Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Xerox Corp.andP;  Recently, Aldus Corp.,andO;Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc. have taken active roles in thedevelopment of Unicode.andM;The Multilingual CodesetandM;Unicode will simplify application development at international MIS shops byproviding a single, uniform character standard for 99% of the languagesknown.andP;  Plans are in place to include historical languages, as well.andP;  &quot;TheUnicode standard evolved from the industry's need for a 16-bit version ofASCII,&quot; explains Joe Becker, a principal sccientist for Stamford, Conn.-basedXerox Corp. and a technical vice president for Unicode Inc.andP;  &quot;Informationprofessionals gathered together to take the best from existing standards andapply their multilingual software experience to designing a simple, completecharacter encoding.andM;&quot;In other words,&quot; continues Becker, &quot;Unicode encompasses all major languagesand offers a strong foundation for international MIS shops.andP;  This standardwill make multilingual software easier to write, MIS shops easier to manageand international information exchange more practical.&quot;andM;The Unicode project was initiated in early 1989 by an informal working groupof linguists, engineers, managers and information professionals fromorganizations that were using or developing international informationssystems.andP;  The group determined the most effective way to achieve aninternational standard with the same level of simplicity and efficiency asASCII would be to establish an inter-company, international characterstandard.andM;Under the guidance of research librarians, Unicode staff reviewedbibliographic standards and requirements for modern and ancient texts andincorporated these whenever possible.andM;A Catchy Code?andM;Is Unicode part of a computer architecture or is it just a communicationsstandard?andP;  That's up to the users to decide.andP;  Some MIS shops may end up usingUnicode only as an exchange medium to facilitate communication betweendifferent national systems with incompatible codesets.andP;  Other MIS shops mayimplement entirely new computer hardware architectures to support 16-bitUnicode text directly (examples would be to create extended keyboard memoryor to make actual hardware changes on the keyboard itself).andM;The review draft of Unicode contains about 25,000 characters alone, coveringall the world's major scripts, including some 18,000 Han--ideographiccharacters--incorporation national and de facto industry standards in China,Japan, Korea and Taiwan.andP;  Unicode has room for a total of 65,000 characterswithin its 16 bit-wide memory space (see table, &quot;Local 16 Bits And What DoYou Get?&quot;).andP;  Obsolete scripts such as cuneiform, hieroglyphs and ancient Hancharacters (used in specialized research) will be added to future releases asrequired.andM;Of course, Unicode will only become a useful standard if widely adopted.andO;Microsoft Corp. says it will incorporate Unicode in the TrueType fonttechnology of its upcoming Windows 3.1 environment, as well as in itsWindows-32 version.andP;  Apple Computer plans to include it in its newestcharacter set technology.andP;  Even IBM is looking at Unicode as the standard forfuture hardware.andM;Although Unicode may never replace ASCII altogether, a large number of MIShardware and software vendors have shown support for Unicode.andM;The final review draft of Unicode version 1.0 came out in December of 1990.andO;The review period closed in mid-February.andP;  Since then, the Unicode consortiumhas been working to incorporate members' comments into the soon-to-bereleased Unicode version 1.0.andM;John R.
