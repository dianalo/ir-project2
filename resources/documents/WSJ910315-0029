Mr. Bush again asserted that a formal cease-fire with Iraqwon't be possible as long as the Iraqi army is usinghelicopter gunships to suppress civilian uprisings againstSaddam Hussein. But the president also said that he isn't&quot;trying to impose a solution inside Iraq,&quot; and he declaredthat he won't let American troops get bogged down inlong-term deployment there.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mitterrand, who had sent troops to participate in thewar to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, was more blunt. Afterholding talks here with Mr. Bush, the French leader said heconsidered his troops' job &quot;done&quot; with the liberation ofKuwait. He suggested that French forces won't get involved inthe current violence inside Iraq unless the United NationsSecurity Council passes new resolutions authorizing them todo so.   &quot;As far as France is concerned, that particular period ofour intervention in the Middle East is now terminated,&quot; Mr.Mitterrand said, referring to the just-ended war.   Both presidents appeared to be trying to warn Iraq thatits pariah status is likely to continue as long as itviolently crushes internal dissent. But they also seemed tosignal that, as much as they would like to see Saddam Husseinoverthrown, they don't intend to get directly involved intrying to help the Iraqi dissidents. Mr. Bush specificallysaid he didn't want to &quot;play into the hands&quot; of Iran, whichis accusing the U.S. of angling to keep its troops in thePersian Gulf region to control events there.   Mr. Bush and Mr. Mitterrand apparently spent most of theirtwo-hour meeting on this French Caribbean island discussinghow to get talks moving to settle the dispute between Israeland the Palestinians. Mr. Bush ruled out talks with thePalestine Liberation Organization for now, saying that theU.S. intends to pursue discussions with independentPalestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Secretaryof State James Baker opened those talks this week.   Mr. Bush didn't flatly rule out talks with the PLO at somefuture point, but he made clear that he has little interestnow, in the immediate aftermath of the PLO's strong supportfor Iraq during the war over Kuwait.   But the remarks by the French and American leaders onlyserved to illustrate how difficult it will be to getinternational agreement on how to pursue the Palestinianissue. Mr. Mitterrand appeared more open to talking directlyto PLO leader Yasser Arafat, saying that Mr. Arafat remainsatop the PLO and that the PLO &quot;still appears as therepresentative organization.&quot;   Mr. Mitterrand also recalled that France has called for aPalestinian state in the past, and implied that it stillfavors one. Mr. Bush repeated the U.S. opposition to creationof such a state. And Mr. Mitterrand repeated his belief thatan international conference on the Middle East would helpsolve the Palestinian problem, while Mr. Bush suggested thatsuch a high-profile conference isn't a good idea right now.Mr. Bush added that &quot;at the right time, it could be useful.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
