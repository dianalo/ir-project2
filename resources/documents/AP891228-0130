One policeman was killed and four were wounded, they reported.   At about 6:45 a.m., about 100 Shining Path rebels withsubmachine guns and bazookas attacked the police post in NuevoProgreso, a jungle area 260 miles northeast of Lima, according toInterior Minister Agustin Mantilla.   Mantilla said the guerrillas fled after three Peruvian policehelicopters attacked them.   A government anti-narcotics official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the three helicopters were dispatched from theU.S.-built antidrug base at Santa Lucia, about six miles from NuevoProgreso.   Eight helicopters on loan to Peruvian police from the U.S. StateDepartment are stationed at the base for use in antidrugoperations. The helicopters are flown by American contract pilotsbut are officially under police command _ the only policehelicopters that operate in the area.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene Bigler said no U.S. helicopters orpersonnel were involved in the battle.   He told The Associated Press two helicopters piloted byAmericans flew a reconnaissance mission Thursday morning from thebase. He said base personnel received a request for assistance fromthe police post at Nuevo Progreso, but said he did not know if thereconnaissance flight was related to the attack.   Bigler said three Peruvian army helicopters stationed in nearbyUchiza picked up the police casualties and took them to Santa Luciaso they could be flown to Lima.   A military spokesman in Lima had no comment.   The Peruvian drug official said three helicopters from the baseflown by Peruvians took part in the Thursday fray and pursuedretreating rebels.   Bigler said no Peruvian pilots or co-pilots currently are at thebase.   Santa Lucia is the operations center for U.S. drug agentsworking with Peruvian police to attack clandestine airstrips andcoca-processing laboratories used by cocaine smugglers.   Twenty to 40 Americans, including agents, contract pilots andmechanics, work out of the base, where eight UH-1 (Huey)helicopters are stationed. The helicopters have door-mounted M-60machine guns.   Huallaga Valley is the world's single largest source of the cocaleaf. Most of the leaf is made into coca paste and sent to Colombiato be refined into cocaine.   Joint operations began in September. Peru suspended them Dec. 21to protest the U.S. invasion of Panama. The government lifted thesuspension and operations resumed Tuesday.   Valley drug traffickers operate in league with Shining Pathrebels, who protect them from police for a share of drug profits.   Bigler said U.S. law bars U.S. personnel and helicopters frombeing used to fight the guerrillas. U.S. officials haveacknowledged, however, that antidrug operations could result inconfrontations with the rebels.   The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 near Ayacucho, 235miles southeast of Lima in the Andes Mountains. The rebels nowoperate throughout the highlands and in the coca-producing junglesof the northeast.   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in theviolence.</TEXT></DOC>
