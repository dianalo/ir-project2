(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vermont Supreme Court Justice Louis Peckcan remain on the bench even though he is past the state'smandatory retirement age for judges, a federal appeals court ruledMonday.   The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes almosta year after Peck was scheduled to be retired by the state becausehe had turned 70.   The state Constitution calls on all judges to retire at age 70,but Peck had fought the provision, saying it conflicted with afederal age discrimination law.   ``I feel like a condemned man who has had a reprieve,'' saidPeck Monday night after learning of the decision. ``Personally itis very satisfying.''   Peck, now 71, said he will now give some thought to steppingdown. ``I may retire anyway,'' he said.   The ruling by the New York-based federal appeals court settlesthe Peck case, but it does not settle the issue. Two other federalappeals courts, the 8th Circuit and 1st Circuit, have ruled theother way on the question, which means judges in thosejurisdictions must adhere to their states' mandatory retirementprovisions.   ``Obviously Congress has not made its intention clear if thecourt disagree,'' said William Gray, the lawyer who represented thestate of Vermont in the suit against Peck.   Gray said it would be several weeks before the state decidedwhether it would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.   ``Taking away from states the power to decide when they retiretheir judges is a major shift of power from the states,'' said Gray.   Thomas Lehner, the state court administrator, said he had notseen the decision and would not comment until he had.   At issue was whether a federal law _ the federal AgeDiscrimination and Employment Act _ applied to appointed statejudges. The law prohibits age discrimination against most employees.   The state of Vermont argued first that judges fit one of theexceptions _ ``appointees on the policymaking level'' _ and secondthat Congress should not tell states how to set up their courts.   On the first argument, the appeals court said appointed statejudges do not fall under the exception. ``Congress meant to denyADEA protection only to such appointees as would normally workclosely with and be accountable to the official who appointedthem,'' the judges said.   On the second argument, the judges said Vermont had failed toshow the federal law improperly trampled on the rights of thestates. ``There is no suggestion that Congress surreptitiouslyenacted any legislation without notice to the state of Vermont,''the court said.   The decision by the New York-based 2nd Circuit counters rulingsby the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the St.Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Those federalappeals courts upheld state mandatory retirement provisions.   Peck was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court in 1981. Hiscurrent term expires in 1993. He turned 70 on Dec. 24, 1988,prompting Lehner to place him on retirement status, effective June30, 1989, and prompting Peck to file an age discriminationcomplaint with the EEOC, which filed suit on his behalf. Last July,U.S. District Judge Lee Gagliardi sided with Peck, prompting theappeal by the state to the 2nd Circuit.   The Vermont Supreme Court has five members. It is the onlyappeals court in the state.</TEXT></DOC>
