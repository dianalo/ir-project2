Conventional digital transient stability programs includeboth an integration step and a load flow calculation by, for example,Newton method to estimate generator accelerating power. To reduce a computationburden, in this paper, a linearized load flow model (LLFM) is proposedfor the generator accelerating power calculation. The LLFM method givesa fast but an approximate solution and in this sense this approach inthe transient stability analysis is somewhat similar to that of an approximatereal power flow method (DC method) in the load flow problem. The effectivenessof the LLFM based transient stability assessment method is ascertainedin terms of calculating speed and accuracy through various numericalexamples for 6,44 and 90-bus system.</TEXT></DOC>
