The statement is misleading and inaccurate in at least three respects.    First, there is no special &quot;arrangement&quot; between the FDIC and Credit Suisse First Boston or MCorp or any of its banks regarding these certificates. Deposits in FDIC-insured banks are insured within the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act without regard to the nationality of the depositor. FDIC insurance of deposits cannot be &quot;arranged&quot; by banks, but is a matter of existing law. No FDIC approval is needed.    Second, the certificates in question will not be issued by MCorp, which is a bank-holding company, not a bank. They will be issued by the separate, insured banks within the MCorp system.    Finally, the reference to Eurodollar markets is inaccurate in that the deposits will consist of funds placed with the various MBank members in the U.S. and will not be held in offshore branches or affiliates. The certificates will represent funds placed with FDIC-insured banks in the U.S. by depositors who happen to be nonresidents and who are entitled by law to the same deposit protection as is afforded any other depositors dealing with FDIC-insured banks.
