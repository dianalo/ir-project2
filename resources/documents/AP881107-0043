(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A student suspected of unleashing a ``virus''into an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide tried frantically towarn operators after discovering his experiment had gone awry,associates said.   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a first-year student in CornellUniversity's doctorate computer science program, is suspected ofcreating the computer virus that last week clogged the computerstied to a military network.   He has been unavailable since discovery of the virus Thursday.His father, Robert T. Morris Sr., a government computer-securityexpert, said his son left the university Thursday to avoid reporters.   The senior Morris has refused to say whether his son created thevirus.   The electronic virus, so named because it multiplies afterinvading a computer, jammed computers across the country linked tothe Pentagon-supported Arpanet network, slowing computers byreproducing itself over and over. But affected centers reported thevirus only took up memory space and did not destroy any files.   ``It could have been a whole lot worse,'' said Dexter Kozen, oneof Morris' instructors. ``He could have wreaked a lot more havoc. Ican't believe it was malicious. Mischievous, yes.''   Friends of Morris quoted today in The Washington Post said Morriscreated the virus as an intellectual challenge and that the viruswas supposed to lie dormant in computer systems.   Morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program looseWednesday night and checked it before going to bed. Discovering hismistake, Morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus'spread.   ``His machines at Cornell were so badly clogged he couldn't getthe message out,'' said Mark Friedell, an assistant professor ofcomputer science at Harvard University, where Morris did hisundergraduate studies.   Panicked, Morris called Andrew Sudduth, systems manager atHarvard's Aiken Laboratory. He asked Sudduth to send urgent messagesto a computer billboard, explaining how to defeat the virus, Sudduthtold the Post.   ``The nets (computer networks) were like molasses,'' Sudduthsaid. ``It took me more than an hour to get anything out at all.''   Cornell officials said Sunday they have no absolute proof thatMorris caused the virus. But the evidence in the university'scomputer system so far points to Morris, they said.   One Cornell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidSunday that it appeared there was an early version of the virus inMorris' computer files.   The elder Morris, chief scientist at the National ComputerSecurity Center in Bethesda, Md., said the episode will ``clearlyraise the awareness of the existing vulnerabilities, particularly ofnetwork systems.''   The father has written widely on the security of the Unixoperating system, the target of his son's virus program, and iswidely known for writing a program to decipher passwords, which giveusers access to computers.   Morris said Sunday his son planned to meet with a lawyer todayand would not be available for comment until Tuesday or Wednesday.``He's concerned, obviously,'' said the father, reached at his homein Arnold, Md.   The FBI, which is investigating whether any computer crime lawswere broken, have not yet spoken with his son, he said.   The programmer who designed the network's electronic mail programthat the virus invaded said he had forgotten to close a secret``back door'' to the program, The New York Times reported today.   Eric Allman said he created the opening to make adjustments tothe program, but forgot to remove the entry point before the programwas widely distributed in 1985. He was working for a programmingorganization at the University of California, Berkeley at the time.   Paul Graham, a computer science graduate student at Harvard and afriend of Morris, compared Morris' exploit to that of Mathias Rust,the young West German who flew a light plane through Soviet airdefenses in May 1987 and landed in Moscow.   ``It's as if Mathias Rust had not just flown into Red Square, butbuilt himself a stealth bomber by hand and then flown into RedSquare,'' Graham told the Times.</TEXT></DOC>
