Theseplanning functions include geology, surveying, mining engineering andcoal quality. Boundary Hill Mine was the first truck and shovel operationin Central Queensland. It was the first to have an inpit coal crusher,where the coal is conveyed out of the pit via a secondary crusher intoa live reinforced earth bunker. Since the coal mined is crushed in thepit and loaded directly into trains, the aspects and importance of coalquality have been discussed in detail. The effects of a programme tode-water the overburden and coal, thus improving overburden operatingconditions, and to attempt to decrease the total moisture content ofthe coal have also been discussed. The following environmental aspectshave been outlined: (1) Pre-mining environment - which includes climate,rainfall, temperature, topography, natural vegetation, fauna, land useand capability; (ii) post-mining environment - rehabilitation, watermanagement, dust, noise and ground vibration. 2 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
