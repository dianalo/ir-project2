 The code was slow, bulky, and nearly useless.andO;Not any more.andP;  Now, both the Accell/SQL application generator by Unify Corp.andO;and the Nova appliation generator by Four Seasons Software can be quiteuseful to software developers, either for prototyping or for developing alarge variety of applications.andM;Unify asserts that Accell/SQL can be used in generating applications asvaried as document publishing, computer-aided design, accounting,telemarketing, presentation graphics, and telephone-network management.andP;  Itclaims that Accell/SQL can create up to 80 percent of the code for theseapplications.andP;  Actually, Accell/SQL can produce all of the code needed toimplement some database projects.andM;Accell/SQL is part of a family of software components including, amongothers, Unify 2000 for SQL, Accell/CP, Accell/IQ Advanced Visual ReportWriter, Accell/SQL, and the Accell Integrated Development System.andP;  Unify 2000is one of several RDBMSs produced by Unify.andP;  Accell/CP is a system thatallows screen-processing tasks to be off-loaded from a UNIX host to DOS-basedPCs.andP;  Accell/CP also allows applications to be run on DOS-based PCs andallows a migration path from DOS applications to UNIX.andP;  Accell/IQ works as areport-writer, an English-language query system, a business-graphicspresentation module, and a file-transfer utility.andP;  When accompanied byAccell/CP, Accell/IQ can run on DOS PCs.andP;  Accell/SQL, the applicationgenerator, produces ANSI-standard SQL that supports a variety of RDBMSs andinterfaces, including Unify 2000 for SQL.andP;  The Accell Integrated developmentSystem is a UNIX-based application-development system consisting of anapplication generator, a 4GL, and an RDBMS.andM;Unify's software is based on development work started more than 10 years ago.andO;Four Seasons Software's Nova Application genator, on the other hand, is amore recent development.andP;  It is an interactive development system, producingapplications that can access a number of different commercial database files.andO;Since Nova application software consists of pseudo-instructions that areinterpreted by a runtime engine, applications can run on many differentmachines and under several different operating systems, without change.andO;Although the code is interpreted, the high performance of today's microsensures that Nova applications execute fast enough for most purposes.andM;InstallationandM;Installation of Accell/SQL is a fairly lengthy process, but reasonablysimple.andP;  It is described in a 27-page guide.andP;  Installation requires a minimumof 4 MB of RAM initially, but Unify recommends 8 MB; 35 MB of hard disk spaceare needed, too.andM;A general description of the installation procedure for Nova is given in twopages of its user manual, but the installation for a specific platform isdescribed elsewhere in a short document customized for that platform.andP;  FourSeason Software's printed documentation lacks information about hardwarerequirements for installation.andM;DocumentationandM;Unify has put a prodigious effort into documenting its products: 28 volumes,weighing 20 pounds.andP;  There are about 4200 pages in all, including i400 forAccell/SQL itself.andP;  The documentation is well-organized and very readable.andP;  Aparticularly thoughtful and welcome feature is that the many manuals forAccell/SQL have a master index--140 pages long--bound in one volume.andP;  This isin addition to the separate index that each manaul has.andM;Four Seasons Software's documentation for Nova is briefer than Unifydocumentation.andP;  Aside from an &quot;executive introduction&quot;, it consists of twothick manuals in separate three-ring binders: a tutorial and a user manual.andO;The index for the user manual seems a bit short, with only about 800 separateentries.andP;  However, the manual has labeled thumb tabs that make it fairly easyto find general topics.andP;  Like the user manual, the index for Nova's tutorialmanual is, if anything, too short.andP;  The manual is nicely organized, though.andO;It describes the building of an order-entry system to illustrate the chieffeatures of the application generator.andP;  It takes about an hour to workthrough each of the 11 chapters that describe how to build the demoapplication, something that is well worth doing.andP;  It gives a good generalpicture of Nova.andM;ImplementationandM;Unify's accell systems has been implemented on more than 150 differentUNIX-based computers, from micros to mainframes.andP;  The system is best thoughtof as having three layers: a presentation layer, an application-generationlayer, and a database layer.andP;  The presentation layer can be Accell's owncharacter-based user interface, Microsoft Windows, or OSF Motif.andP;  Unify sayssupport is under way for ATandamp;T's Open Look.andP;  The application layer, or middlelayer, is Accell/SQL, a generator of ANSI-standard SQL that is used by thethird layer, the database layer.andP;  The database layer can be one of severaldifferent RDBMSs: Unify RDBMS version 4.0, Unify 2000, SCO Integra, Sybase,or Oracle.andM;Four Seasons Software's Nova package has been implemented on a large numberof platforms, too, and for several flavors of UNIX, including Xenix, AIX, andUltrix.andP;  It also runs under DEC VMS, DOS, and OS/2.andP;  Nova applicationsgenerated for exeuction on one operating system and on one platform run onother platforms and under other operating systems without modification--theapplications are interpreted by Nova's runtime engine.andM;It is useful to think of Nova as involving three separate layers, too.andP;  Forits presentation layer, Nova can use the X Windows interface on any platformwhere the X Windows library is available.andP;  Nova can create window-orientedsystems, even on character-based terminals.andP;  Scroll bars, color, and mice areavailable on Sun workstations, on X Windows, and on PCs.andP;  The complete userinterface adapts to the target environment automatically.andP;  Nova comprises theapplication-generation layer, or middle layer, of the system.andP;  Unlike Unify,Four Seasons Software does not supply an RDBMS, or third layer, for itsproduct.andP;  Instead, Nova can use RDBMSs created by other companies, includinga Unify RDBMS.andP;  In addition, Nova applications can use Informix or Oracle, orflat ASCII Files, or in-core tables; any Nova application can access morethan one of these simultaneously.andP;  Four Seasons Software says that interfacesfor Ingres and Sybase databases will soon be ready.andM;Feature SetandM;Accell/SQL has several components that provide an integrated developmentsystem when combined: Accell/Environment, Accell/Generator, Accell/4GL,Accell/Manager, Accell/Report Writer, Accell/Menu handler, Accell/CP, andAccell/DBMS.andP;  The Accell/Environment consists of the forms and menus that areused to access Accell/SQL components.andP;  The Environment supports the editingof Accell/4GL Scripts and Accell/Generator forms, and compiling and runningapplications.andP;  The Environment also includes a source-management database toaid in maintaining applications.andM;Accell/Generator allows you to define application forms by filling in theblanks on some Accell/SQL forms.andP;  The Generator lets you design forms on thescreenn, as well as change a window's size, shape, and location, and specifyits borders.andP;  The Gennerator lets you define fields in forms, set theposition of fields, and set the attributes of forms--all by filling inblanks.andM;Accell/4GL is an English-like language with a core of event-drivenstatements, and embedded procedural statements.andP;  Applications are produced byadding Accell/4GL commands to forms that are created by Accell/Generator.andM;Accell/Manager is the Accell/SQL runtime module.andP;  The Manager uses bothtable-driven and compiled techniques for running applications.andP;  It linkstogether the user, data, and forms that comprise the application and thecompiled Accell/SQL 4GL code.andM;RPT, the Accell/Report Writer, generates reports for accell/SQL applications.andO;It uses a non-procedural, English-like language for selecting the format andplacement of columns, column titles, footers, headers, page boundaries, anduser-defined functions.andP;  The input for reports can come from both Accell/SQLand SQL/A queries, from standard ASCII files, and from RHLI user programs.andO;RHLI (Relational Host Language Interface) provides a comprehensive library ofC language functions that allow development of C language databaseapplications--RHLI user programs--that use the full functionality of theUnify 2000 RDBMS.andM;Accell/Menu Handler, an interactive, menu-driven environment, generates menusystems for software-development projects or for running finishedapplications.andP;  The Menu Handler can create help documentation for menus andoptions.andP;  It also has options for keeping track of menus, programs, securityspecifications, and users.andM;Accell/CP provides a shared, cooperative processing environment that permitsthe user-interface part of Accell/SQL to execute on personal computersrunning DOS, but linked to a UNIX host.andP;  With Accell/CP, database columnediting, data input, and window management can be done on the PC.andO;Application processing and database management remain on the host.andP;  Accell'sDOS &quot;hot key&quot; lets users move between Accell applications and DOS programs.andM;Accell/DBMS creates the database and adds or modifies tables by usingANSI-standard SQL statements.andP;  After this is done, Accell/SQL or SQL caninsert, query, update, delete, or manipulate data.andP;  Accell/DBMS has severalaccess methods, and it also has facilities for controlling access.andP;  Thefull-use version of database software must be used in developingapplications, but when applications are being run, only the runtime versionof database software is needed, as one might expect.andM;The most important feature that sets Four Seasons Software's Nova apart fromother application generators is that it is object-oriented.andP;  Examples of theobjects that Nova deals with are menus, forms, tables, fields, reports,function-key handlers, and windows.andP;  Various functions are performed on theseobjects.andP;  The sequence of function and object combinations created by Novadefines the high-level logic of a Nova application.andM;There are three main tasks in developing a Nova application: data-dictionarycreation, window editing, and application-logic definition.andP;  Unlike someother application generators, Nova allows these three tasks to be done in anyorder.andM;Nova screen-painting functions give the application builder considerablefreedom to define the user interface.andP;  Windows can easily be created andre-sized or moved.andP;  Nova supports context-sensitive, on-line help functions.andO;It also allows context-dependent function keys to be defined by the user.andO;This may be a dubious feature because it allows inconsistent definition ofkey functions, potentially resulting in user interfaces that are hard tolearn.andM;Nova has good arrangements for security.andP;  Access can be controlled by thedatabase, field, or table.andP;  A rare feature, made practical by anobject-oriented design, is that access can also be controlled at the level ofan individual function in the application logic.andM;Nova can ensure the integrity of database transactions, depending on themethod that is used by the underlying DBMS.andP;  The underlying DBMS executes itsown start, abort, or commit instruction when Nova issues a correspondingstart, abort, or commit instruction.andP;  If a commit instruction executed by theunderlying DBMS fails because of some problem--because of a lack of diskspace or because of record-locking problems, for example--the databasetransaction is rolled back as if a Nova abort instruction had been executed.andM;SupportandM;Unify requires customers to purchase a one-year support contract with thepurchase of Accell/SQL.andP;  It offers three levels of support: premium,standard, and on-site.andP;  Premium support consists of support for thedevelopment system and support for runtime systems, telephone support from asenior engineer assigned to your account, software updates and new releasesat no additional charge, a two-hour initial-call response, monthly callreports, on-line access to Unify's bulletin board, and a budgeted number ofdays of consulting services.andM;Standard support consists of support for the development system, telephonesupport by Unify's software-support group, software updates and new releasesat no additional charge, and on-line access to Unify's bulletin board.andO;On-site support provides experienced support personnel dedicated tosupporting your development project at your site.andP;  Unify's consultingservices include assistance in application development, benchmarking,database design, and project management.andM;The support program for Nova is less elaborate than the support program forUnify products.andP;  Annual support for Nova costs 15 percent of the suggestedlist price of Nova.andP;  These support costs range from $149 for Nova runningunder DOS or OS/2 on an IBM PC, to $6450 for Nova running under UNIX on aFujitsu A-600 or on a Pyramid 9830.andM;Future DevelopmentandM;Accell/SQL is a robust, older product.andP;  Recent improvements consisted offixing some bugs and adding an interface to Informix.andP;  Nova, on the otherhand, is a more recently developed product that is now having a major newfeature added to it: distributed processing.andP;  When Four Seasons Softwarecompletes development, sometime this summer, the product will be released asSuperNova 2.0.andM;The functions and objects of Nova applications run on a local machine, butwith SuperNova 2.0 many of these can be distributed to other machines.andO;User-interface objects, such as forms and menus, cannot be distributed, butit wouldn't make much sense to distribute the user interface, anyhow.andM;The most important thing about SuperNova's implementation of distributedprocessing is that it is transparent to the user.andP;  No special instructionsneed to be put into an application to move an object or function from onemachine to another.andP;  The application builder only needs to use the SuperNovaeditor to create distribution schemes--data tables--that give the names offunctions and objects in an application and the names of the servers thatthey run on.andP;  SuperNova takes care of the rest.andP;  SuperNova is designed to bedistributed to machines running DOS, as well as to those running UNIX or VMS.andO;This allows user interaction and input validation to be off-loaded toinexpensive personal computers, while database operations are handled by morepowerful machines.andM;Dr.andP;  Baird Peterson, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, this month's reviewer, has aPhD in psychology.andP;  He consults about software quality assurance anduser-interface design.andP;  Dr. Peterson is writing several books about UNIX, tobe published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1991.andM;Richard Morin, column editor, operates Canta Forda Computer Laboratory, aconsulting firm in San Bruno, CA, specializing in the application of UNIX toengineering and science.andP;  A former director of the Independent ComputerConsultants Association, Morin is currently on the board of the SunMicrosystems User Group.andP;  His electronic-mail address is{hoptoad,pacbell}lcfcllrdm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
