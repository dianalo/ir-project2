Cecil Andrus banned thetemporary storage in Idaho of any new shipments.   The boxcar full of low-level nuclear waste had been in limbo ata rail yard in the eastern Idaho city of Blackfoot, the last stopbefore a temporary waste storage facility at the U.S. Department ofEnergy's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory about 35 milesnorthwest of here.   It originated at the DOE's Rocky Flats facility, 16 milesnorthwest of Denver, but was stopped after Andrus issued an orderWednesday banning the storage of additional waste at the lab.   ``The boxcar will return to Rocky Flats and we'll probably justleave it on our siding until we get permission to ship it someplaceelse,'' said Charles Bogard, shift superintendent at Rocky Flats.   The boxcar left Blackfoot mid-afternoon Saturday. An Idaho StatePolice officer and a Union Pacific railroad agent had kept an eyeon the boxcar while it was in Blackfoot. It had been inspected forsafety by an environmental engineer from the Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory.   Lab spokeswoman Penny Phelps said the decision was made lateFriday by Energy Department officials in Idaho, Colorado andWashington.   ``Primarily, the decision was made to kind of clear the air andremove what we considered a contentious item,'' Mrs. Phelps said.   The move was delayed by the need to examine the potential impactof returning the waste to Rocky Flats, she said. ``It's not as easyas turning your car around and driving back.''   Andrus issued the order in an effort to force the EnergyDepartment to open the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad,N.M., the nation's first permanent repository fordefense-generated, low-level nuclear waste.   More than 2 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive wastealready is stored above ground at the Idaho lab, awaiting transferto a permanent dump like the one in New Mexico, which was supposedto open this month, but has been postponed until at least January.   ``They have broken their word too many times,'' said Andrus, whotraveled to the New Mexico site last week. ``They cannot give us adate.''   ``Hopefully the opening of the WIPP facility will be the finalsolution,'' Rocky Flats' Bogard said Saturday. ``We have about 90days capacity and space on the plant site that's available where wecould safely store it.''   The opening of the New Mexico site was pushed back after DOEengineers raised questions about the safety of the proposedrepository. There have also been delays in certifying the casksthat will carry the waste to the site.   New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers said New Mexico communitieswill object to opening the site until Congress provides money forroad bypasses and improvements on the route to the site.   The Idaho governor won an assurance from Don Ofte, manager ofthe Idaho laboratory, on Friday that the DOE will voluntarily abideby his ban on all further shipment of waste into Idaho.   The bulk of the waste at the lab, built up over two decades, hascome from the Rocky Flats plant. Other facilities also have beenordered to stop shipping waste to the lab.   Andrus said a westbound truckload of waste from the ArgonneNational Laboratory in Illinois was turned back at Little America,Wyo., after federal officials were notified it would be interceptedby state police at the Idaho border.   Meanwhile, an Oct. 19 letter from Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., toEnergy Secretary John Herrington indicated the DOE began assessingthe storage situation only after Andrus blockaded Idaho.   Wirth, in his letter to Herrington, again pressed for a list ofcontingency plans to cope with the Andrus ban, declaring that inhis state ``the situation has changed from urgent to critical.''   Wirth said Deputy Energy Secretary Joseph Salgado had notifiedhim Wednesday afternoon, shortly after Andrus imposed the ban, that``he was pulling together an internal DOE working group to assess''the governor's action.</TEXT></DOC>
