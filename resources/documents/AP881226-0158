I'm going tolearn how to drive,'' says Bruce Quinn, 32 years old and legallyblind.   Quinn, who expects by summer to run two radio stations 50 milesapart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the firsttime, using glasses equipped with small telescopes to spot detailslike signs and lights.   ``I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I'vehad a lot of fun with it and never any trouble, so I should be allright,'' said Quinn, of Delphi. ``It offers me a lot ofopportunities. Something called freedom. Goodbye to Greyhound. A lotof handicapped people are stuck on Greyhound.''   California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for morethan 10 years and about 25 states have such programs for as many as2,000 nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of MotorVehicles director of licensing.   Brown developed Indiana's bioptic registration program at theurging of a vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help fromlow-vision optometrists.   ``I thought it was the greatest idea in the world when I heardit. It's nice to do a little good for someone,'' he said. ``Youwouldn't believe how sad it is to tell a man he cannot drive again.I've had men cry. Driving is probably the single most importantthing in any man's life.''   Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensingguidelines, says not everyone is suited for the program. Getting alicense is ``a major step toward independence,'' but ``it's notsomething that I push,'' he said. ``Driving is a great privilege,but it's also a great responsibility.''   In Indiana, bioptic drivers must have vision correctable to20-200 in glasses, 20-40 through the telescopes with up to 4Xmagnification, a horizontal visual field of 130 degrees and no majorblind spots, color defects or other visual problems. They must beevaluated and fit for the telescope, get a six-month learner'spermit and training _ available only in South Bend, Indianapolis andEvansville _ and pass a road test.   The telescopes cost $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in sizeand weight, but the most common are about an inch in diameter andabout 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angleupward from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, orin some cases both. When the user needs to see some detail, he tiltshis head forward to look through the scope.   ``Most bioptic drivers, especially the older ones, tend to driveonly in familiar areas,'' said optometrist Dr. Debra McConnaha ofIndiana University. ``It's possible they might be able to drive tothe grocery and back without using the telescope. It's there if theyneed it.''   Supporters of the program say bioptic drivers must be able toglance through the telescopes and spot something in less than asecond, about the time drivers with normal vision might spendlooking in a rear-view mirror.   Opponents say that's impossible.   Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N.J., ophthalmologist who's beenprescribing bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need atleast three seconds to adjust to looking through the telescope, spotthe detail, and then readjust to looking through normal glasses. Hesaid the telescope creates a blind spot that is twice as wide as thefield of vision through the scope.   ``The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test.There's no evidence this device is safe, and there is overwhelmingevidence it is a hazard,'' Fonda said.   Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at theUniversity of Louisville Medical School, says the telescopes createan illusion of nearness to objects and that an ``awning effect''obscures overhead signs. He and Fonda support letting low-visionsufferers drive under restricted privileges, such as under 35 mphonly and not on freeways.   ``There are lots of ways to help people without encumbering withan optical device that imposes limitations,'' Keeney said.   A 1983 study of bioptic drivers in California showed they werenearly twice as likely as the general driving population to have anaccident, said Bill Gengler, spokesman for that state's Departmentof Motor Vehicles.   ``The accident rate was higher, but not significantly. In fact,it was lower than rates for a variety of other types of Californialicensed drivers with different medical conditions,'' Gengler said.   Despite the accident rate, advocates claim bioptic drivers areamong the most careful on the road. Bioptics say they know theirlimitations and won't exceed them or else risk losing part of theirindependence.   ``We stress the safe-driving aspect as part of the privileges weget as drivers,'' said Marc Sessions, president of the 1,000-memberAmerican Bioptic Certified Drivers based in Laguna Niguel, Calif. Hesaid the group's initials, ABCD, also stand for ``Always Be CarefulDriving.''   Teresa Canada, 34, of Jasonville, started driving at 16 but losther license eight years ago because of her vision. ``I have to bemore careful than others. If I feel I am not capable, I am not goingto be on the roads,'' said Canada, driving through downtownIndianapolis after her road test in October.   Until she got a bioptic license, Canada had to call her husbandat work if an emergency came up at home with any of their fourchildren. ``It's been eight years since I've been able to drive, soI've been in a kind of a prison.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 29</NOTE></DOC>
