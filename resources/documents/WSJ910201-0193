U.S. Judge John Keenan in Manhattan ruled that federalprosecutors opposing the book's publication had tried tointimidate the author and the publisher into dropping plansfor the book. He also ruled that the government hadoverreached in the way it was trying to apply non-disclosureagreements signed by the author, a former prosecutor in thecase.</LP><TEXT>   Taking advantage of the ruling and possibly some freepublicity, Penguin said it will rush the book, &quot;OpeningArguments: a Young Lawyer's First Case, U.S. v. OliverNorth,&quot; to publication and could have it in stores as earlyas mid-February. The author, 30-year-old Jeffrey Toobin,worked as an assistant counsel to Lawrence Walsh, theindependent prosecutor handling the Iran-Contrainvestigation.   In an unusual pre-emptive move, Mr. Toobin and Penguinsued the office of the independent prosecutor last November,rather than wait for the government to take action againstthe book.   &quot;This establishes a new strategy for publishers&quot; facingpossible legal action by the government, said Martin Garbus,an attorney for Penguin, a unit of Britain's Pearson PLC.Although other attorneys urged him to wait until thegovernment actually took steps to stop publication, Mr.Garbus said, &quot;We went right to court and said, `This book issafe. Now give us a ruling.'&quot;   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for Mr. Walsh and the Officeof Independent Counsel, said the government will appeal JudgeKeenan's decision. Citing the continuing investigation andconcerns about disclosures of grand-jury proceedings, Ms.Belcher said, &quot;We shall appeal and ask for expeditedconsideration.&quot;   The government's main argument is that Mr. Toobin's bookallegedly disclosed confidential information from theinvestigation. But Judge Keenan ruled that much of thematerial flagged by the government has previously beendisclosed -- in congressional testimony, other books and evenspeeches by Mr. Walsh. The judge also found that the bookdiscloses nothing about the workings of the grand juryinvolved in the case.   &quot;The court has found that {Mr. Toobin and Penguin} haveshown through ample support that the information contained inthe manuscript of `Opening Arguments' has been placed intothe public domain by the government,&quot; Judge Keenan said.   Mr. Toobin, now a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's officein Brooklyn, concedes he wasn't a major player in the Northcase: He argued one motion before the court and traveled toCentral America to do some research.   &quot;It's not really an Iran-Contra book,&quot; he said. &quot;It's morea book about how one of these investigations works.&quot;   ---   PAN AM IS SUED for alleged discrimination over ban onIraqi passengers.   The suit, which seeks to be made a class action on behalfof other Iraqis, was filed by an Iraqi national who says hefled his country because he opposed the government of SaddamHussein. The plaintiff, H. Salman of New York City, said inthe suit that he came to the U.S. in 1984 and is now a lawfulpermanent resident.   The suit said that Pan Am Corp. began its policy on Jan.17 when the company told its ground crews and reservationagents to prohibit all Iraqi nationals from boarding Pan Amflights. Mr. Salman said he tried to make a reservation on aPan Am flight out of New York on Wednesday, but was told bythe reservation agent that Iraqis weren't allowed.   Filed in federal court in Manhattan, the suit accuses PanAm of violating state and federal anti-discrimination laws bybanning people on the basis of their national origin. The banis being applied &quot;irrespective of whether such individualspresent any security threat,&quot; the suit claimed. &quot;There areless restrictive procedures available to ensure the securityof air travel.&quot;   Terry Gross, an attorney for Mr. Salman with the New Yorklaw firm Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky andamp; Lieberman,said the suit &quot;highlights the absurdity of Pan Am's policy.Here we have somebody who fled Iraq because of politicalpersecution. . . . The U.S. State Department recognized {Mr.Salman} as a political refugee. His father had been executedby the regime that brought Saddam Hussein to power.&quot;   The suit seeks a court order halting Pan Am from enforcingthe policy and unspecified damages.   A Pan Am spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit.The company has refused to confirm that it is banning Iraqipassengers, though Pan Am reservation agents have said theywere instructed to bar anyone with an Iraqi passport frominternational flights.   ---   GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES can sue under whistleblower act,judge rules.   The decision, by a federal judge in Macon, Ga., is one ofa handful to address the issue of whether governmentemployees can bring suits under the False Claims Act. The lawallows private citizens to file fraud claims on behalf of theU.S. -- and to share in any money recovered from individualsor companies that have cheated the government.   But until recently, government employees were consideredto be barred from bringing such suits if they learned of thefraud through their jobs. The idea is to prevent governmentworkers who learn of fraud through their work, perhaps duringan audit or in the course of an investigation, from racing tothe courthouse to use the information for private gain.   In the Macon case, an Air Force contract analyst revieweda cost proposal submitted by McDonnell Douglas Corp. in 1980covering spare parts for F-15 fighters. The analyst, CarolynMcDowell, investigated the cost calculations and took herconcerns to the auditor general's office at the Air Force. Itisn't clear from court papers whether she conducted herinvestigation on her own, or on Air Force time. The auditorgeneral's office declined to initiate criminal or civilproceedings.   Last April, Ms. McDowell filed her own suit under theFalse Claims Act. The U.S. Justice Department, which has theoption of intervening in such cases, did not. Instead, itasked U.S. District Judge Wilber D. Owens Jr. to dismiss thesuit on the ground that Ms. McDowell learned of the allegedfraud while working for the U.S.   But Judge Owens declined to dismiss the case, ruling thatgovernment workers are entitled to bring such suits undercertain circumstances. The judge did not elaborate, but saidthat lawyers for Ms. McDowell will have to establish whethershe detected the alleged fraud in the course of her work orwhether it was &quot;the product of independent efforts.&quot;   Spokesmen for the Justice Department and McDonnell Douglasdid not return phone calls. Ms. McDowell's attorney, J.Hatcher Graham of Macon, said the only two prior courtopinions addressing the issue reached conflictingconclusions.   ---   PHILADELPHIA LAW FIRM SUFFERS partner defections.   The chairman of the litigation section of Wolf, Block,Schorr andamp; Solis-Cohen, Alan J. Davis, and two other partners,Robert McLaurin Boote and Andrew J. Rudolph, are leaving tojoin Ballard, Spahr, Andrews andamp; Ingersol, also inPhiladelphia. A fourth partner, Mark L. Alderman, will jointhe Philadelphia banking law firm Klehr, Harrison, Harvey,Branzburg andamp; Ellers.   The departures fueled speculation that Wolf Block, aprestigious and politically well-connected law firm, is inturmoil. About a year ago, the firm's environmentaldepartment quit to form an independent law and consultingfirm. Three months ago, a U.S. judge ruled Wolf Blockdiscriminated against a former female associate who wasdenied partnership.   &quot;In a tough legal environment, there is tremendousmobility that did not exist in prior years, and lawyers aremoving more and more between law firms,&quot; according to CharlesKopp, Wolf Block's co-chairman.   &quot;Wolf, Block has been one of Philadelphia's strongest lawfirms for decades and will remain so,&quot; he added.</TEXT></DOC>
