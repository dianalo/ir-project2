Investors took the report as an indication the Federal ReserveBoard has room to lower interest rates, and the stock marketrallied. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 39.55points to 2,683.20.   Inflation, which had been rising at a 6.7 percent annual ratefrom January through May, has abated to a 4.4 percent rate for thefirst nine months of the year.   The inflation rate so far this year is the same as in both 1988and 1987 and well under the Bush administration's 1989 inflationprojection of 5 percent.   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser at the White House,called the report ``good economic news.''   ``We're delighted to be able to say that, while we're always onguard to make sure that inflation remains under control, theconcern earlier in the year that inflation was getting out ofcontrol appears to have been unfounded,'' he said.   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department'sConsumer Price Index follows no gain at all in August and similarlymodest 0.2 percent rises in July and June.   Although private economists said inflation was likely to pick upin the fourth quarter, jittery stock and bond markets rallied onThursday's news, interpreting it as a sign the Federal Reservelikely will nudge interest rates lower.   Because of the stock market turmoil set off by the Friday the13th nosedive, the Fed has eased a key interest rate from about 9percent to 8.75 percent. Analysts predicted another quarter-pointdecline soon in the federal funds rate, which banks charge eachother for overnight loans.   ``Under these circumstances, there is no question that interestrates will fall,'' said economist William K. MacReynolds of theU.S. Chamber of Commerce.   In an effort to contain inflation, the Fed has been using highinterest rates to slow the economy. Although wholesale-priceinflation shot up 0.9 percent in September, other statistics forthe month portray a sluggish economy with weakening manufacturingemployment, industrial production and housing construction.   In other reports:   _The Labor Department said new state unemployment claims for theweek ending Oct. 7 grew 62,000 in a week's time to 396,000. Thatreport amounted to a further indication of the economy's softness.   _The department said Americans' average real weekly earnings of$338.67 in September were up 3.5 percent from a year earlier _ notenough to keep up with inflation. Adjusted for inflation, earningsrose 0.3 percent last month following a 0.7 percent decline inAugust.   The nation's 38.9 million Social Security recipients watchedThursday's consumer-price report with particular interest becauseit affected the benefit increase they're due to receive in January.   Benefits will climb 4.7 percent, the biggest boost in 7{ years,to offset the effects of inflation over the last year. The averagemonthly payment will climb $25 to $566.   At the same time, the cap on Social Security payroll taxes willrise. Workers will have to pay the tax on their first $50,400 inwages, up from $48,000.   Analysts were suprised by the September inflation data. They hadbeen expecting higher crude oil costs to ripple through to gasolinepumps, pushing up prices overall by about 0.4 percent.   But energy prices declined for the fourth consecutive month.Gasoline, down 2.2 percent in September, has fallen 9.3 percent inthe last four months after increasing 21.2 percent in the firstfive months of the year.   Fuel oil prices dropped 0.2 percent last month after declining0.9 percent in August.   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicagosaid higher energy prices likely will show up when October's reportis released.   ``There has been an abatement of inflation, but it hasn't beento the degree that this (0.2 percent) number would suggest,'' hesaid. ``We're likely to have some less attractive numbers in thefourth quarter.'   Food prices, which had shot up at a 9.3 percent annual ratethrough May, climbed at a rate of just 1.7 percent from Junethrough September. They rose a moderate 0.2 percent last month, inpart because of a 1.1 percent decline for fruits and vegetables.   Coffee prices fell 2.7 percent last month. However, the indexfor dairy products jumped 1.4 percent, the largest monthly increasesince May 1980.   Clothing prices, after falling in the three preceding months,rose 1.7 percent in September, with another increase expected forOctober. Prices for apparel for women and girls, reflecting theintroduction of new fall and winter fashions, were up 3.6 percent.   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. said theSeptember report was favorably influenced by several price dropsunlikely to be repeated.   The cost of new cars fell 0.4 percent, the fifth drop in a rowand the longest such string since the Labor Department begantracking those prices in 1953, he said.   Auto dealers ``are giving the ... things away,'' he said.``There's a point where you just can't do more and I think they'vereached that point.''   Tuition and school fees fell 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted,while hotel and motel costs dropped 4.5 percent.   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at125.0 in September, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goodsand services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period would havecost $125 last month.</TEXT></DOC>
