This article focuses on recent progress made in understandingthe microorganisms involved in converting organic matter to methane andthe future contributions microbiology will be able to make to improvethe process. There are three preliminary points about microbial bioconversionto CH{sub 4}, that the author makes. First, there is generally a greaterdegree of metabolic specialization in anaerobes than in aerobes. Forexample, many pure cultures of aerobes can completely mineralize celluloseto CO{sub 2}. However, the conversion of cellulose, or even simpler compounds,to CH{sub 4} and CO{sub 2} requires the cooperative interaction of severalmicrobial species. Second, most of the free energy present in the substratecan be found in the methane that is produced. This makes the processattractive, since the methane produced can be burned for energy generation,but it also means that there is less energy available to the organismsinvolved in breaking down the substrate. The final point is that manyof the most important bacteria involved in anaerobic bioconversion areslow-growing, strict anaerobes. These organisms are difficult to cultureand isolate, which discouraged many microbiologists from studying them.The recent development of simpler techniques for culturing strict anaerobeshas contributed greatly to the recent increase in the isolation rateof new anaerobes.</TEXT></DOC>
