Terrific.;   This Andalehas beer, sangria, margaritas and fresh, homemade fruit drinks. I tried aglass of honeydew juice ($1), which turned out to be a lot more palatable thanMidori. I also had a remarkably creamy coconut flan ($2.25).;   The spaces forordering and waiting are more clearly defined than in the Los Gatos store, butit's still pandemonium back there when Andale is busy, which ought to be mostof the time. You can hear your order called even from the outdoor street-sidetables.; Andale Taqueria; (star)(star)(star)(star) The best?; Where: 209University Ave., Palo Alto.; Hours: 11-10 daily (until 9 Sunday).; Orders:(415) 323-2939.; Et cetera: Beer, sangria, margaritas.
