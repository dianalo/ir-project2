While crude-oil prices fell as expected and unleaded gasoline rose slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating-oil contracts for December delivery on the Merc surged 1.18 cents a gallon, to 57.03 cents. Trading volume doubled.    The focus of the market's activity confirmed that a potentially market-moving speech by the Saudi Arabian oil minister Tuesday was a price dud, analysts said.    With winter approaching, heating-oil stockpiles should be building. Instead, the American Petroleum Institute's closely monitored weekly statistics, released after the market closed Tuesday, showed a large drop-off in U.S. stockpiles of heating oil and gasoline products. Stocks of heating oil were down 2.8 million barrels, to 122.1 million, for the week ended Nov. 6.    &quot;The API statistics are the main impetus behind today's increase, and of course the much colder-than-normal weather throughout the Northeast,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.    The heating-oil move was unusual because crude oil usually leads heating oil and gasoline, not vice versa. A few traders said New York City's biting cold yesterday emphasized to them that there could be a strong heating-oil demand.    Meanwhile, crude oil's world-wide price movement yesterday -- or rather, the lack of it -- confirmed analysts' lukewarm reaction Tuesday to what could have been a big event: the first public oil-policy speech in the U.S. of Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister.    Mr. Nazer spoke at the petroleum institute's annual meeting in Chicago Tuesday. But he merely restated that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should maintain a $18-a-barrel benchmark price, although the Saudis won't bend over backward to stabilize prices.    &quot;Basically the market yawned at his statements,&quot; said one of the analysts who heard the speech, Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. &quot;One, it was expected that's what he'd say, and two, he can't say much more than that because the king has already laid out his public statements.&quot;    The Saudis also don't want to show their hand before the OPEC meeting in Vienna next month, analysts said.    Indeed, Mr. Nazer isn't expected to go much beyond what he said in Chicago even at a highly private talk, scheduled for tonight, before oil-industry executives and others at the Council on Foreign Relations, a private-research group in New York. As previously reported, Mr. Nazer's outspoken predecessor, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, spoke at the council last week. He reportedly was bearish on prices for the near future.    Most analysts agree with Mr. Yamani's view. However, Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., a New York broker, notes that foreign-exchange factors might keep oil prices from plunging too much.    &quot;The lower dollar in my opinion is obviously somewhat bullish . . . in the sense that . . . (it) means less revenue and therefore it means OPEC must get its act together,&quot; keeping its prices up around $18 to $20, he said. &quot;It forces OPEC to stay within the (production) quota that they set last year.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: The surge in futures was interrupted for the most part, as selling trimmed early gains. December-delivery copper settled at $1.041 a pound, for a net gain of 1.70 cents, after advancing as much as 6.80 cents. March, on the other hand, after rising to a gain of 3.60 cents, fell to end at 91 cents with a net loss of 1.40 cents. As a result, December increased its premium over March by 3.10 cents to 13.10 cents a pound, which, analysts said, continued to emphasize the tightness of copper supplies. The cash price on the London Metal Exchange and the December contract in New York's Commodity Exchange, influenced each other in volatile trading throughout the day, one trade source observed. The increase in margins on the Comex, which was scheduled to take effect as of the close of trading yesterday was a price-depressant, analysts said. Robert Wylde, president of R. J. Wylde, Inc., metal brokers and traders, noted that at one point early in the day the London cash price was 18.5 cents above its counterpart in New York, the December contract. &quot;Selling later in London, depressed the price there and this was reflected in New York,&quot; said Mr. Wylde. &quot;Finally, as further late selling influenced by New York depressed the London price, it closed only about 6 3/4 cents above New York December,&quot; he said. Analysts agreed that the increase in margins, or the good-faith deposit, particularly in the December contract, which was raised by $5,200 a contract to $8,000, prompted some liquidation of contracts. Also, one analyst said, &quot;No one questions that the price was going to rise above $1 a pound, but with the recent leaps and bounds, it was getting up there a little too fast and too soon,&quot; prompting selling by dealers.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices rose in early trading and held onto modest gains for the rest of the day as traders nervously awaited this morning's release of merchandise-trade figures for September. The stock-index and stock markets also continued to receive support from President Reagan's comments Tuesday that he didn't want the dollar to go lower, analysts said. Bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures gained 2.80 to 242.20 index points. Treasury-bond futures prices fell 0.375 to 88.969 points in relatively light trading. The cash-bond market was closed in observance of Veterans Day. The amount of attention focused on the trade figure &quot;is getting ridiculous. We've got a pool in the office where everybody's betting on where it will come in,&quot; said Gerald Walsh, a futures analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in New York. The stakes riding on the trade figures, beyond office-pool kitties, are high. On Oct. 14, financial markets went into a tailspin in reaction to the Commerce Department's report that the nation's trade imbalance narrowed only slightly in August to $15.68 billion from $16.47 billion in July. Analysts are expecting a further narrowing of the imbalance to about $14.5 billion for September, Mr. Walsh said. </TEXT></DOC>
