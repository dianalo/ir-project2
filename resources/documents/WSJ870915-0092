But it was actually made to the Senate in 1965 by Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), who unsuccessfully tried to defeat the nomination of Abe Fortas to the high court.    Today, as the Senate Judiciary Committee takes up the nomination of Judge Bork, GOP senators who support the nomination, including Sen. Thurmond, are likely to vehemently decry any significant role for the Senate in Supreme Court nominations. But Democrats trying to block Judge Bork's confirmation are certain to boldly proclaim the intent of the framers that the Senate play an active role.    There have been contested Supreme Court nominations throughout the nation's history. And the battles that have ensued are inextricably linked to debate over the proper role of the Senate. In this, the Constitution's Bicentennial year, President Reagan's nomination of Judge Bork has once again raised fundamental questions about the division of powers between the Senate and the White House.    Republicans contend that the Senate shouldn't consider Judge Bork's conservative ideology. &quot;Our inquiry should focus on the nominee's ability and integrity,&quot; argues Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas. &quot;If we . . . require that judicial candidates pledge allegiance to the political and ideological views of particular senators . . . we will do grave and irreparable violence to basic separation of powers principles . . . .&quot;    But Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, counters: &quot;Until recent times, few have questioned the Senate's right to consider the judicial philosophy, as well as the judicial competence, of nominees. The founders intended it and the Senate has exercised it.&quot;    The debate is over Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution, which says the president &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court . . . .&quot; The question is the meaning of the words advice and consent.    Many constitutional experts say that the framers envisioned an active role for the Senate. &quot;The Senate should consider anything the president considered, including ideology,&quot; says Philip Kurland, a University of Chicago Law School professor. Harvard Law School Prof. Laurence Tribe agrees that, &quot;An agency entrusted to advise is entitled to take into account fully all of the considerations that the advisee may take into account.&quot;    Some experts disagree, however. Michael McConnell, another University of Chicago law professor, argues that, &quot;The Senate can only serve as a check on abuse by the president.&quot;    There can be little dispute, however, that throughout history the Senate has looked at politics and ideology in Supreme Court nominations.    In 1795 the Senate rejected George Washington's nomination of John Rutledge of South Carolina, who had been a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. The reason for the rejection was purely political; the nominee had criticized the treaty with Great Britain negotiated by John Jay the previous year.    In 1835, the Whig-dominated Senate rejected Roger Taney because as a cabinet official he had carried out President Andrew Jackson's order to remove government deposits from the Bank of the United States. When Democrats gained strength in the next election, President Jackson nominated Mr. Taney to be chief justice and he was confirmed.    Statistics demonstrate the Senate's active role. There have been 103 Supreme Court justices, but the Senate has rejected another 26 nominations, or about 20% of the total.    In more recent times, the role of politics has often been obvious. Conservatives tried to block the appointments of Abe Fortas and Thurgood Marshall. In 1967, Sen. Thurmond warned that the choice of Mr. Marshall &quot;would make the court more decidedly liberal . . . since it would give the liberals, in all probability a bigger margin of power.&quot; The criticism mirrors the warning sounded by Democrats that the nomination of Judge Bork may tip the court's balance in a conservative direction.    In 1968, Sen. Thurmond and others successfully filibustered and killed the elevation of Justice Fortas to be chief justice, largely because they thought his rulings were too liberal.    The precise intent of the framers is difficult to discern because James Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention's debate on Supreme Court nominations are sketchy. For most of the four-month convention, the delegates favored giving the power to appoint justices, as well as ambassadors, not to the president but either to the entire Congress or to the Senate alone.    On June 13, 1787, the delegates rejected appointment by both houses of Congress and in a voice vote tentatively agreed to give the Senate the power to choose. Five days later, Alexander Hamilton proposed executive nominations that would be subject to the &quot;approbation or rejection&quot; of the Senate.    When the matter was again brought up on July 18, delegate Nathaniel Ghorum of Massachusetts pushed presidential appointment and Senate review. But Luther Martin, a Maryland delegate, argued that the Senate was &quot;most capable of making a fit choice.&quot; On July 21, the delegates once again voted six states to three to leave the appointment power in the Senate, rather than the White House.    With little explanation, the matter was referred on Aug. 31 to a committee to handle postponed matters, and when that 11-man group reported on Sept. 4, a compromise was proposed to give the president the power to nominate and the Senate &quot;advice and consent.&quot; With no explanation of the compromise and virtually no additional debate on Supreme Court nominations, the proposal was written into the Constitution. </TEXT></DOC>
