Some embodiments utilizerails made entirely from superconducting ceramics, while other embodimentsutilize rails with metallic cores covered by layers of superconductingceramics. Cooling of the superconducting ceramic to a temperature belowits critical temperature is accomplished by liquid nitrogen cryorefrigeratoror a compressed gas cryorefrigerator.</TEXT></DOC>
