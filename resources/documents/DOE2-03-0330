For this purpose,we used phantom of thorax and myocardium. Thoracic phantom consists ofmediastinum filled with low concentrated Tl solution and lung filledwith wooden tip. Myocardial phantom consists of eight parts (upper andlower parts of anterior wall, septum, posteroinferior wall and lateralwall). In one phantom we changed the thickness of wall (10 mm, 7.5 mm,5 mm, 2.5 mm, 0 mm) and in another phantom we changed the Tl concentration(100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 %, 0 %). In our results, the thickness and theconcentration correlated well with the count and five grades (100 %,75 %, 50 %, 25 %, 0 %) were well separated though it was said that SPECTis inaccurate in quantification. But in 180 deg half scan, the countof upper part was 10 - 15 % lower than that of lower part and the countof posteroinferior wall was about 10 % lower than that of anterior wall.We have to take it into account in quantification. In conclusion, usingTl-201 myocardial SPECT residual myocardium in infarct area can be evaluatedfrom the severity of defect, and from that the severity of ischemia canbe evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
