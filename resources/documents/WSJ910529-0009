Mr. Boussena, who became OPEC president last year, hadhinted in March that he didn't wish to be renamed president.At the time, many OPEC watchers said that Saudi Arabia, thegroup's heavyweight, would likely block any such bid becauseof Algeria's pro-Iraq stance during the Persian Gulf War.</LP><TEXT>   At the March meeting, the first following the war, therewas obvious friction between Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oilminister, and Mr. Boussena, who had been openly critical ofnew Saudi ties to Western nations after the war.   A rift in Algerian-Saudi relations is significant becausethe Saudis, who are pricing moderates, are no longerprotective of Algeria, an advocate of higher prices. &quot;We areworrying less about Algeria,&quot; one Saudi official said at theMarch meeting. Mr. Boussena said yesterday that he willcontinue to support an OPEC reference price of $21 a barrel.   Possible successors to Mr. Boussena include CelestinoArmas, oil minister of Venezuela, and Jean Ping, the Gaboneseoil minister.</TEXT></DOC>
