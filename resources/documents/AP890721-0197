From Brooklyn to Idaho to Fayetteville, N.C., people say theyare feeling squeezed.   On Capitol Hill, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspanpredicted Thursday that consumer prices would rise 5 percent to 5.5percent this year, less than previously predicted.   The inflation rate remains too high, but the Fed has preventedprices from spiraling by keeping interest rates high, Greenspansaid.   Twelve blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue at another Capitol Hillestablishment, Donald Turley said things did not seem so good tohim.   ``I don't know who's writing the statistics up, but from my ownpoint of view, I can remember in the early '70s, middle '70s,things seemed a lot easier,'' said Turley, an employee of CapitolHill Great Day Pet Parlor.   ``It takes everything you have to go from payday to payday. Youdon't have enough money to do the things you need to do, let alonethe things you want to do,'' Turley said.   ``Things can't get any worse, but they always do.''   Not everyone is feeling pinched, of course. The U.S. economy isin the longest peacetime expansion on record. The June monthlyinflation of 0.2 percent was the lowest in 16 months, the CommerceDepartment said Wednesday.   ``I'm very happy with this Republican administration,'' saidanother Capitol Hill figure, Sam Rowland, owner of Capitol HillFlorist in Washington. ``When the Democrats are in there you starveto death.''   ``My general opinion I don't really feel inflation's all thathigh,'' said Brad Rice, city manager of Rent All Minnesota in St.Paul, Minn. His company _ which rents items ranging fromconstruction equipment to party supplies _ raised rental prices 5percent in April.   ``What has affected me the most is the cost of children'sclothing and shoes. They seem to go up every year,'' said CherreWall, a secretary at Fleishman's Tiny Town childrens clothing storein Fayetteville, N.C., who is married and has two boys, aged 12 and15.   ``The overall rate is more than we can keep up with sometimes,''she said.   Even the true bargains, like falling rates for long-distancephone service, don't seem to impress consumers.   Lori Mael, a clerk at the Diworshak hydroelectric dam inAhsahka, Idaho, said she doesn't make many long-distance callsanyway. And Mrs. Wall, the North Carolina secretary, said she hasher doubts about the phone rate claims.   ``They want you to think they're going down. I don't know ifthey are or not.''   Behavioral scientists say people's perceptions of inflation arebased almost entirely on personal experiences, not statistics.   At Animal Hair Manufacturing Co. in Brooklyn, N.Y., theperception of inflation is bad.   The company _ on Beard Street _ cleans and processes rawhorsehair for use in brooms and brushes. It used to deal in whitehorsehair for violin bows, but the price per pound has gone from $5in the 1940s to $400 now.   The company can't afford to compete with Europeans for suppliesof horsehair from South America because of the drop in the value ofthe dollar, said the president, Walter Deligdish.   ``For us to get it from Europe, it's just outrageous,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
