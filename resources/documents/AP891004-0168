Manuel Antonio Noreiga shows his position isweakening and vowed the battle will continue.   All agreed that in the short run at least, the victoriousNoriega will crack down even more on those who defy his authority.   ``From this point on, there is going to be a lot of oppressionagainst unallied military officers and against opposition people,''said Luis Endara, cousin of opposition presidential candidateGuillermo Endara. ``This is going to be an excuse for Noriega toretaliate.''   He said his cousin, now reportedly in hiding somewhere in PanamaCity, will continue his highly publicized hunger strike and pushfor an economic boycott of the Noriega regime by the people ofPanama.   Exile groups here say they are receiving desperate messages fromPanama that other civilian political figures, including Raul Ossa,a vice president of the Christian Democratic Party, are beingrounded up by security police.   Endara was careful to draw a line between the authors of thecoup attempt and the opposition. He noted the insurgents nevermentioned recognizing the opposition slate as the legitimategovernment of Panama, despite unanimity among internationalobservers that Guillermo Endara won the last presidential election.   The coup does show that Noriega is losing control of themilitary, Endara said.   ``Over 300 military people are in prison in Panama now,'' Endarasaid. ``Obviously, the man is terrified because right now hedoesn't know who is really with him.''   The coup attempt was the second in 18 months, noted AurelioBarria, former head of Panama's Civic Crusade, which organized lastyear's domestic opposition to Noriega. He now leads an exile aidgroup here.   ``He hasn't gained support in this period. He has been losingsupport,'' Barria said. ``The military institution isself-destructing.''   He cautioned, however, that the officers who staged the latestcoup attempt seemed more interested in internal military disputesthan democracy.   ``It proves that isolated actions are not the solution,'' Barriasaid.   Barria said he did not think the United States should haveintervened directly. But he said his contacts in Panama wereangered that broadcasts from U.S. bases in Panama failed to providethe populace with information on what was happening, which couldhave sparked more public support.   Endara went further, saying a show of force by U.S. troops couldhave tipped the balance in favor of the coup. He said officers onthe fence would have sided against Noriega if they had seenevidence of military support by the United States.   They agreed, however, that Noriega's days are numbered.   ``The fight for democracy is not over yet,'' Barria said. ``AndNoriega has two strikes agaisnt him.''   To the average Panamanian political exile, the coup failure wasdevastating.   ``My heart fell to my feet,'' said Rita Conte, who said herexcited family had been planning to return home when they thoughtthe coup was successful.   While most Panamanians here strongly oppose Noriega, one of hisMiami attorneys, Raymond Takiff, said no one should count thegeneral out.   Takiff, who represents the general in his fight against a Miamidrug indictment, said he spoke early Wednesday to the militaryruler's aide Maj. Edgardo Lopez, who had Noriega at his side.   Takiff said Noriega dismissed talk about dissension in themilitary, and he also said the general, contrary to reportsTuesday, was never hurt or in the custody of the dissidents.</TEXT></DOC>
