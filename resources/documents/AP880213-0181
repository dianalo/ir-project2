In a related development, The New York Times reported thatMoscow wants limits on sea-launched, non-nuclear cruise missiles, amove that appeared to toughen the Soviet position at the arms talks.   Igor Palenykh, Moscow's chief delegate, said the test blastswill help the two sides reach agreement ``preferably in the firsthalf of 1988'' on anti-cheating measures intended to lead to theratification of two 1970s superpower treaties limiting the power oftest blasts.   Palenykh said that after ratification on the 1970s test bantreaties, both sides should proceed to limit and ultimately bannuclear tests.   He spoke to reporters at Geneva airport after arriving for asecond round of nuclear talks to begin Monday.   In the first round of talks in November, U.S. and Sovietnegotiations reached basic agreement to demonstrate technology fordetecting blast yields during experiments at the main U.S. andSoviet test ranges.   The second round is expected to set the dates and settle allquestions of ``the preparation and conduct'' of the joint tests,Palenykh said.   In January, teams of U.S. and Soviet scientists made five-dayinspection tours of the Soviet test range at Semipalatinsk and theU.S. site in the Nevada desert.   The Times, in its Sunday editions, said the Reaganadministration officials thought the two sides agreed during theDecember summit meeting in Washington that cruise missiles carryingconventional warheads will not be covered by a new strategic armstreaty.   The Soviets are asking that the number of the long-rangesea-launched weapons armed with conventional warheads be limited to600, the newspaper reported.   It said the Soviet proposal calls for a limit of 400nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles, for a total limit of1,000 of the guided long-range, subsonic weapons.   The United States, which is planning to have 2,643conventionally armed cruise missiles for use at sea, opposes theinclusion of such missiles in a new treaty, arguing they are neededto improve the United States' capability to fight without nuclearweapons, the Times said.   The Times said some experts speculate that the Soviet Unionwants a cap on the total number of sea-launched cruise missilesbecause it is difficult to distinguish between cruise missilesarmed with nuclear and non-nuclear warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
