It is found that a hydrated electron is added to sulfonyland dithiocarbamate groups with formation of anion-radicals A and B,absorption of which is maximum at {lambda}/sub max/=600 and 315 nm respectively.Rate constants of anion-radical recombination of kinetic first-orderequal K/sub A/=7.0x10/sup 5/ and K/sub B/=3.2x10/sup 4/ c/sup -1/. Electrontransfer from anion-radical A to dithiocarbamate electron-acceptor centerof another anion-radical A with formation of trianion-diradical is detected.The rate constant of this process equals or exceeds 8.5x10/sup 10/ dm/sup3/xmol/sup -1/xc/sup -1/.</TEXT></DOC>
