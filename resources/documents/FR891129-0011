The first amendment wouldadd the agency's bumper and theft prevention standards to those Federalstandards for which conformity is necessary for permanent importation ofa motor vehicle into the United States. Although conformity of importedcars with these standards is required by statute, current importation regulationshave never been amended to include them. The second amendment would extendcoverage of the bond required by NHTSA for a demonstration of conformitywith the safety standards, to vehicles imported between January 31, 1990,and October 31, 1992, by importers who owned the vehicle as of October31, 1988, and whose assigned place of employment was outside the U.S. attimes from that date until the time of importation. This bond would supersedethe current equivalent Customs bond. The third amendment would specifythe terms and conditions of the two NHTSA bonds.

A notice of proposed rulemaking to establish part591 was published on April 25, 1989 (54 FR 17772), and a final rule onSeptember 29, 1989 (54 FR 40069). As the notices stated, the 1988 Act amendsthose provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of1966 (``the Vehicle Safety Act'') that relate to the importation of motorvehicles subject to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (section108(b), 15 U.S.C. 1397(b)). The importation of motor vehicles subject tothe Federal motor vehicle bumper standard (15 U.S.C. 1916), and the Federalmotor vehicle theft prevention standard (15 U.S.C. 601) was not includedin these changes. Importation of passenger motor vehicles subject to thebumper standard is to be governed by joint regulations of both NHTSA andthe Secretary of the Treasury (15 U.S.C. 1916(b)(3)), under terms and conditions(including the furnishing of a bond) sufficient to ensure conformance,or exported or abandoned to the United States. Importation of vehiclesand equipment subject to the theft prevention standard is flatly prohibitedunless vehicles and equipment conform at time of entry. In reviewing agencyprograms. NHTSA and Customs have agreed that regulatory simplicity requiresthat all vehicles subject to NHTSA's standards should be imported pursuantto a NHTSA regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Federal Bumper Standard</ITAG>Title I of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C.1901 <T3>et seq.</T3>) was enacted in 1972, and required NHTSA to promulgatebumper standards applicable to all passenger motor vehicles imported intothe United States. In implementation of this requirement, NHTSA issued49 CFR Part 581, <T3>Bumper Standard</T3>, effective September 1, 1978. The importationprovisions in the Cost Savings Act for vehicles subject to the bumper standardswere substantially similar to those for vehicles subject to the safetystandards. No standard was to apply to a vehicle intended solely for exportand so labeled or tagged. No person was to import a passenger motor vehiclemanufactured on or after the effective date of a bumper standard unlessit was in conformity with such a standard. However, it could be admittedunder the joint regulations of the Secretaries of Treasury and Transportationunder such terms and conditions (including the furnishing of a bond) asappeared appropriate to ensure conformity, or exportation or abandonmentto the United States. The joint regulations could also provide for the``importation'' (as contrasted with the ``temporary importation'' allowedby the Vehicle Safety Act) of any passenger motor vehicle after its firstpurchase for purposes other than resale.However, the joint regulation that applied to the importation of vehiclessubject to the Federal safety standards, 19 CFR 12.80, was never amendedto incorporate the bumper standard, although NHTSA enforced it as partof its importation compliance procedures. With the advent of NHTSA's ownvehicle importation regulation, 49 CFR part 591, this notice proposes toadd bumper standard importation requirements to the declarations requiredfor entry, and to amend the bond provisions to include compliance withthe bumper standard. To fulfill the statutory requirement for joint issuance,NHTSA has consulted with the Customs Service on this proposed amendment,and the final rule will be jointly issued under the authority of both regulatoryagencies.The bumper declarations and requirements are virtually identical with thoserequired for the safety standards. There is one exception, however, NHTSAhas interpreted the 1988 Act as requiring a showing of total compliancewith the safety standards, or exportation or abandonment of the motor vehicleto the United States. NHTSA does not read the Cost Savings Act as imposingthe same punishment in the absence of such a showing regarding the bumperstandard. Therefore, in the event that a passenger motor vehicle demonstratescompliance with the safety standards, but not the bumper standard, theagency may choose to levy a penalty upon the bond instead of demandingexport or abandonment of the vehicle, if the facts appear to justify it.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Theft Prevention Standard</ITAG>Title VI of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires NHTSA to issue a vehicle theft prevention standardthat applies to ``covered major parts which are installed by manufacturersinto passenger motor vehicles in lines designated * * * as high theft lines'',and the major replacement parts for those major parts. In implementationof this requirement, NHTSA issued 49 CFR Part 541, <T3>Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard,</T3> effective April24, 1986. Conformance with this standard requires the marking of certainoriginal and replacement parts in the manner specified in the standard.Unlike the statutory importation requirements for safety and bumper standards,title VI contains a flat prohibition against the importation of vehiclesand parts which are subject to the theft prevention standard, but are notmarked in accordance with it. Therefore, vehicles and parts covered bythe theft prevention standard must comply before their importation intothe United States, whether the marking is affixed by the importer, or originalmanufacturer. In terms of part 591, this means that an importer must declarethat his vehicle meets the theft prevention standard, even if it is accompaniedby a declaration of nonconformance with the safety and bumper standards.If, in the first instance, the vehicle does not meet the theft preventionstandard, it will not be allowed entry under bond or otherwise for theeventual production of a conformity statement. Admission under a falsedeclaration may constitute a violation of the regulations of the CustomsService, and result in seizure of the vehicle.This notice proposes appropriate changes in the language of the declarations,and also proposes a new andSection; 591.5(k) that would apply to replacementparts. It would require a declaration of conformity with the theft preventionstandard by the importer of any major part covered by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Bonds for Those Eligible To Import Under Present Regulation</ITAG>Under certain circumstances, and for a limited time, section 108(g) ofthe Vehicle Safety Act permits a nonresident (including any member of theArmed Forces) to continue to import a vehicle under the present regulation,that is, the Administrator need not have made a determination that it iscapable of conformance, and conformance work need not be performed by aregistered importer. This exception applies to a single vehicle imported,for personal use and not for resale, between January 31, 1990, and October31, 1992, by an individual whose assigned place of employment was outsidethe United States for the total period between October 31, 1988, and thedate of importation, provided that the vehicle was acquired (or was subjectto a binding contract to acquire) before October 31, 1988, and that theindividual has not previously imported a nonconforming motor vehicle. Importationunder this amendment is reflected in andSection; 591.5(g).NHTSA had initially assumed that importation of vehicles under this categorywould continue to be covered by the present Customs bond under 19 CFR 12.80,in that the 1988 Act specifically allows importation under the presentrequirements from January 31, 1990, to October 31, 1992. However, NHTSAand Customs have agreed that as of January 31, 1990, all bonds given forconformance with the safety standards should be those of NHTSA. Therefore,appropriate inclusory language is proposed in this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions of the Conformance Bond</ITAG>In its response to the proposal of part 591, General Motors commented thatpart 591 did not state the conditions of the bond. With the determinationby Customs and NHTSA that the bond will be that of NHTSA, it is now possiblefor this agency to propose those conditions. In general, they would includethe acts that the statue requires importers or registered importers toperform after entry of a vehicle and before its release. The bond is givento secure compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and,if the vehicle has been imported under section 108(c) of the Vehicle SafetyAct, no mitigation of the bond is contemplated for vehicles that appearto conform only partially with the safety standards. If full conformancewith the safey standards is not achieved, the vehicle must be exported,or abandoned to the United States. If none of these actions occur, thebond is forfeited. If a vehicle has been brought into full conformancewith the safety standards, but not the bumper standard, NHTSA may not demandexport or abandonment, but only a partial forfeiture of the bond. Thisdiffers from the practice under the present bond (in effect until January31, 1990), which will continue until October 31, 1992, for vehicles importedpursuant to section 108(g). Under this condition, the principal submitsa statement identifying the conforming party, and discussing the natureand extent of the work performed in the conformance process, within 120days after entry (or longer, if the Administrator allows it). It has beenthe practice of Customs to release vehicles under a partial forfeitureof the bond when complete compliance has not been documented, and the vehiclehas not been returned for export. A further condition of the bond for vehiclesimported pursuant to section 108(c) is that the principal would make thevehicle available for inspection upon demand by NHTSA, and would not releaseit from custody before 30 days had passed after its submission of conformancecertification to NHTSA. A further condition of the bond for vehicles importedpursuant to section 108(g) is that the principal would not sell the vehicle,or offer it for sale, until a statement had been issued by NHTSA that itwas acceptable to do so. These conditions are now set forth in proposed andSection; 591.8 (f) and(g). The bond that would apply to importers of vehicles pursuant to section108(c) of the Act is depicted at Appendix A. The bond that would applyto importers of vehicles pursuant to section 108(g) is depicted at AppendixB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Petitions for Remission or Mitigation</ITAG>In the event a bond is forfeited, a principal and/or surety may petitionthe Administrator for remission of the forfeiture. If the Administratorfinds that all conditions of the bond have been, in fact, fulfilled, theforfeiture is remitted.A petition may also be submitted for mitigation of the forfeiture. However,given the intent of the 1988 Act that the Federal motor vehicle safetystandards be enforced more strictly than before, the agency has concludedthat mitigation of forfeiture is inappropriate if a vehicle has been importedpursuant to new section 108(c) of the Vehicle Safety Act, and is not broughtinto compliance with all safety standards. Arguably, failure to conformshould occur infrequently in the future. This is because a vehicle willnot be admitted unless the agency has determined that it is capable ofconformance, and the conformance work will be performed by those who haveregistered with NHTSA as undertaking to provide certifications that vehicleshave been brought into conformity.This restriction would not apply to importers of vehicles under sectionsection 108(g). Vehicles imported pursuant to this provision are exemptfrom eligibility determinations and need not be conformed by registeredimporters. If these vehicles fail to comply fully with the standards, andare not exported or abandoned, the bond would be forfeit, but the Administratorwould entertain petitions for mitigation, just as the Customs Service doesunder the existing regulations.Nor would the restriction apply to either category of importer if the conditionof the bond that is not met relates to compliance with part 581, the Federalbumper standard. The primary purpose of this standard is the preservationof property, rather than the prevention of deaths and injuries. The factthat Congress draws a distinction is found in the permissive authorityof the two Secretaries that allows importation of used passenger motorvehicles whether or not they comply with the bumper standard (15 U.S.C.1916(b)(4)), but forbids the importation of vehicles that do not complywith safety standards unless the vehicles are brought into compliance withthem.These provisions are proposed as andSection; 591.9.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impacts</ITAG>NHTSA has considered the impacts of this proposed rule, and has determinedthat it is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 ``FederalRegulation''. It is intended to formalize existing statutory obligationsof importers of motor vehicles not originally manufactured to comply withthe Federal bumper standard, and to ensure that motor vehicles comply withthe Federal theft prevention standard before their entry into the UnitedStates. It is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatorypolicies and procedures. Less than 3,000 motor vehicles a year are currentlyimported, and it is anticipated that this number will not increase. Thereis no substantial impact upon a major transportation safety program, andthe action does not involve any substantial public interest or controversy.There is no substantial effect on state and local governments. The impactupon the Federal government is that the bonding obligation of the U.S.Customs Service with respect to motor vehicle compliance with Federal standardsis transferred to the Department of Transportation.The agency has also considered the effects of this proposed rule in relationto the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this proposal would nothave a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.Because importers of vehicles that do not conform to the Federal motorvehicle safety standards currently must post conformance bonds of up to300% of the entered value of the vehicle, the proposal that they pay abond of only 150% of such value should result in a lesser economic impactupon vehicle importers. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictionswould not be significantly affected as they are not generally importersand purchasers of nonconforming motor vehicles.NHTSA has analyzed this proposal for purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The proposal would not have a significant effect upon the environmentbecause it is anticipated that the annual volume of motor vehicles importedunder the rule would not vary significantly from that existing before promulgationof the rule.The declaration and bond requirements in this rule are considered to beinformation collection requirements, as that term is defined by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. Although they are modificationsof declarations presently existing in agency form HS-7, the declarationshave been submitted to OMB for its approval, pursuant to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). They will become effective upon approval by OMB.The agency has analyzed the proposal in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 ``Federalism'', and hasdetermined that the proposal does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 591</ITAG>Imports, motor vehicle safety, motor vehicles.In consideration of the foregoing, title 49 Code of Federal Regulationspart 591 would be revised as follows:1.
