In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Craig, a consumer electronics concern based in Compton, Calif., said it holds the equivalent of 204,700 Citadel common shares. Included in the holding are 500 options representing 50,000 common shares that were acquired May 26 from Hecco Ventures, a Los Angeles investment partnership, in exchange for 38,880 Craig common shares valued at $15.625 a share.    The Citadel options that Craig purchased are exercisable at $43.50 a share until they expire on July 7.    According to the filing, Craig holds its Citadel Holding stock for investment purposes.    In a separate filing, Hecco Ventures and an affiliated investor said they had reduced their stake in Citadel Holding to 11.2%, or the equivalent of 391,925 of the Citadel common shares outstanding.    Citadel Holding is based in Glendale, Calif.    According to proxy materials that Citadel sent to its shareholders last month, one of its directors, James J. Cotter, is a general partner of Hecco Ventures and a Craig director. As of Sept. 26, Mr. Cotter held a 24.6% stake in Craig in addition to the 6% stake held by Hecco. Mr. Cotter couldn't be reached for comment.    James A. Taylor, chairman of Citadel, a thrift holding company, said Mr. Cotter and his related companies have received regulatory approval to increase their stake in Citadel to 24.9%. Mr. Taylor said he isn't concerned about the nature of Mr. Cotter's investment.    A spokesman for Craig said the company views its Citadel stake as &quot;a very solid investment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
