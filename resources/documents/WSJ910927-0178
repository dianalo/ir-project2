This judgment would surelydisappoint three interested parties: The Church ofScientology, Ralph Nader's Health Research Group and thelawyers who've been trying to make money from anti-Prozaclawsuits. Only in America can a perfectly useful product comeunder sustained assault from a posse like this. How do theyget away with it?   The Church of Scientology has succeeded financially bytraveling the well-worn path of collecting various troubledminds and souls under the umbrella of a &quot;church.&quot; One of thethings members of a &quot;church&quot; do is contribute money. Part ofthe Scientologist faith is that people suffering fromclinical depression will be poorly treated by medicaldoctors, and a Scientology subsidiary has been spendingheavily on a campaign linking Prozac to suicides.</LP><TEXT>   The plaintiffs' lawyers have succeeded by swimmingopen-mouthed behind this country's personal pain and tragedy.Some of them have filed at least 100 lawsuits linking Prozacwith the suicides of depressed patients.   The anti-Prozac trial lawyers are assertive about theuniqueness of their interest. Carrying many of theanti-Prozac lawsuits is Leonard Finz, a New York City tortlawyer. After the FDA advisory panel issued its clearance ofProzac, Mr. Finz said he'd simply keep bringing lawsuits.   The legislative affairs director of theScientology-affiliated Citizens Commission for Human Rights,Peter Dock, was quoted in the Aug. 14 Washington Post assaying that it refers prospective plaintiffs to Mr. Finz andother lawyers. But Jerrod S. Parker of the Finz firm writesus that &quot;our firm has absolutely no connection or affiliationwith the Church of Scientology or the Citizens Commission onHuman Rights, nor have we ever had any.&quot;   The Finz firm is indeed sensitive on the subject ofProzac, Ralph Nader and the Church of Scientology. In hisletter to us, Mr. Parker wrote:   &quot;It is our firm's position that neither you, nor The WallStreet Journal, have any basis whatsoever for making anyaccusation or suggestion that this firm or any of itsemployees is in any way associated or connected to the Churchof Scientology or the Citizens Commission on Human Rights.Any such suggestion, implication or inference by you or TheWall Street Journal may be libelous, and will be treated assuch. We will take whatever action the law permits in thatregard.&quot;   Finally, there's the Health Research Group, founded byRalph Nader and led for years by Sidney Wolfe. It hassucceeded by not revealing its funding sources. The grouppetitioned the FDA to order a relabeling of Prozac to warnpatients that some Prozac users have &quot;experienced intense,violent, suicidal thoughts, agitation and impulsivity.&quot;   Now, despite all this simultaneous activity, Sidney Wolfeand the trial lawyers argue strongly that it's just acoincidence.   There's actually one more party to all this: Americans whomust endure the illness known as depression. Major depressionis a malady often characterized by an alteration in thechemistry of the central nervous system. Anti-depressantdrugs are themselves chemicals that help restore the balance.For most of the 3.5 million patients who have used it, Prozacis a liberation from the horror that the novelist WilliamStyron calls &quot;Darkness Visible.&quot;   The FDA convened a committee to rule on Prozac's safetybecause of the Scientology publicity, the lawsuits (none hasbeen successful) and the formal petition filed to the agencyby Dr. Wolfe's group. The FDA's advisory panel votedunanimously that there is &quot;no credible evidence&quot; of thealleged link between suicide and Prozac and otheranti-depressants.   Sidney Wolfe in fact maintains Prozac is an &quot;excellentdrug,&quot; which he would prescribe himself. He just wants thesuicide warning on the label. But surely Dr. Wolfe knows thatwere the FDA to do this, the tort lawyers would take itstraight to their jurors, some of whom would surely concludethat even &quot;the government&quot; had worries about the drug. Andthus the lawyers would destroy a drug that Dr. Wolfe says hehimself would prescribe.   We'd find the Wolfe-Nader operation a lot more credible ifit would just come clean on the funding question. Back inNovember, our legal columnist Gordon Crovitz was invited toAtlanta to address the trial lawyers at a $1,000-a-tabledinner. The invitation called it &quot;a fund-raising event for aprogram Mr. Nader is creating to help preserve the Americanjury system.&quot;   Meanwhile, Mr. Nader says that Vice President Quayle'sproposal of 50 reforms for the civil justice system is &quot;usinghis vice presidential office as a platform for winningbrownie points from the big business groups that will fundthe next Bush-Quayle campaign.&quot; We'll find out, becausepolitical contributions are publicly disclosed. But we'llnever know who funds Ralph Nader and Sidney Wolfe. What's tohide? Meanwhile, reporters routinely sneer at ElizabethWhelan's American Council on Science and Health as acorporate front, though it publicly identifies all of itscontributors. This is a bad double standard, and will remainso until it's fully disclosed who other than the tooth fairyis funding the Nader enterprise.   Mr. Nader may well think that Vice President Quayle'seffort to do something about this country's litigationproblem is a subject for ridicule. He may indeed prefer aworld designed by tort lawyers and regulatory bureaucrats.And it may well be that the hyperbolic attack on Prozac by aNader affiliate, a cult and a bunch of contingency-feelawyers was the merest happenstance. The fact remains that welive in the only country in the world where this sort ofeconomic marauding happens routinely, and if someone like DanQuayle chooses to push back against it, he's going to haveour support.</TEXT></DOC>
