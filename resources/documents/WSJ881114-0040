Green (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   Some acquisition-minded banks could get a major new worry if the government wins a little-noticed federal court battle it's waging with a tiny bank in South Texas.    They could be held responsible for criminal acts they didn't commit and may not have known about.    In bank mergers, an acquiring institution often assumes the civil liabilities of a bank it absorbs -- everything from debts to lawsuits to creditor claims. But in a Justice Department case involving a bank's alleged failure to report drug-related currency deposits, the government is arguing that liability for criminal violations also must be assumed by an acquiring bank, in this instance Alamo Bank of Texas.    &quot;This is a case of first impression,&quot; says Charles Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney in Houston who is prosecuting the case. &quot;It's an important legal issue for the banking industry and for financial law enforcement.&quot;    Indeed, attorneys say that if the department's position is upheld, it would seriously complicate the bank merger process. Ferreting out contingent criminal liabilities isn't always easy, some note, because criminal investigations are usually private. And unless the contingent liability is somehow provided for in a merger agreement, it could leave a bank open to expensive litigation and potentially large fines.    &quot;It could be mind boggling,&quot; asserts Thomas G. Sharpe Jr., a Brownsville, Texas, attorney and general counsel of Alamo Bank of Texas.    At the core of the government's case is the alleged failure of Central National Bank of Pharr, Texas, to report sizable currency transactions in 1983 and 1984, as required by federal law. The Justice Department says those transactions included deposits totaling $2.6 million that were made by several drug dealers it was investigating and later prosecuted.    The Pharr bank was acquired in April 1987 by Alamo Bank in Alamo, Texas, a town of about 4,300 people in the Rio Grande Valley near the Texas-Mexico border, only a few miles from Pharr. Alamo says it knew about the reporting failures, but didn't have anything to do with them and was under the impression that the government wasn't going to press charges against Central National.    But last December, a federal grand jury indicted not only Central National on charges of failing to report the transactions, but also Alamo. It said Alamo, with assets of about $75 million, is responsible as a &quot;successor in interest&quot; to the Pharr bank. Alamo eventually pleaded no contest to charges that the currency transactions weren't reported. In Brownsville last week, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela fined Alamo $750,000, which the bank says is more than its annual profit. It suspended $500,000 of the fine and put the bank on three years probation.    The case turns largely on how the language of Texas and federal statutes governing bank mergers should be interpreted. Both provide that where a national and state bank are merged, the consolidated entity assumes &quot;all&quot; liabilities of the merged banks. Such laws generally have been viewed as a way to prevent banks from using sham mergers to evade creditor claims.    As Alamo sees it, these are civil statutes that say nothing about criminal liability and weren't intended to cover it. And banking attorneys say they're unaware of cases in which such laws have been extended to reach criminal violations.    &quot;I just don't think it's been done before,&quot; says Bruce LaBoon, a banking lawyer in the Houston firm of Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill andamp; LaBoon. He notes that criminal laws generally require a showing that a defendant has disregarded or intentionally violated the law. And that's difficult to demonstrate if you're trying to hold a bank responsibile for violations it didn't commit, he says.    But the Justice Department says that when banking laws require banks to assume &quot;all&quot; liabilities they mean just that -- all liabilities, including criminal. &quot;The language of these statutes is direct and unequivocal,&quot; the government argues in papers filed with the Brownsville court. And Mr. Lewis says the issue is crucial because Texas is &quot;awash in drug money&quot; and bank mergers are increasing.    Alamo says it will ask the federal appeals court in New Orleans to resolve the question. &quot;I think the implications reach way beyond our little bank here,&quot; says Allen Shields, president of Alamo Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
