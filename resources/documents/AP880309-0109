The Academy Awards ceremony, scheduled for worldwide broadcastby ABC-TV on April 11, will air without the aid of the strikingWGA, spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said Tuesday night.   The union's western unit board voted unanimously Tuesday nightto reject a request for a waiver from the producers of the Academyof Motion Picture Arts and Sciences show. A waiver would haveallowed union work despite the strike.   Ms. Rhoden said the guild's eastern unit didn't vote because theshow is produced in Los Angeles and would only involve members ofthe western unit.   Scriptwriter Mel Shavelson, former WGA president, and Jack Rosewere hired by the academy to write the program.   ``If there is no waiver, I won't do the show,'' Shavelson saidbefore the vote. He added that the writing is far from complete.``Most of the work is done when the cast shows up at rehearsal.It's rewriting, really.''   CBS-TV announced Tuesday that two new shows scheduled to debutlater this month have been shelved indefinitely.   ``The Dictator,'' a comedy starring Christopher Lloyd, was inits third week of production in New York but didn't have enoughscripts completed to warrant going ahead with next week's premiere,the network said.   No scripts had been completed for the other show, ``The SmothersBrothers Comedy Hour,'' which was to debut March 23.   CBS said ``My Sister Sam,'' which had been removed from thenetwork's schedule earlier this year, would return in place of``The Dictator.'' The network said it would fill ``The SmothersBrothers Comedy Hour'' slot with special programming.   On Tuesday, Leonard Farrell of the Federal Mediation andConciliation Service brought together negotiators for thescriptwriters and producers to review differences.   Both sides outlined differences and issues, but no bargainingwas conducted, said Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance ofMotion Picture and Television Producers. Sticking points werewriters' demands for increased fees and creative rights.   In the early evening, the meeting was recessed until 11 a.m.Thursday.   ``This strike is going to be over someday,'' Farrell toldreporters. ``And it might just as well be over now. That's what weusually tell (the opposing sides).''   The strike began Monday with a massive picket line in front of20th Century Fox studios. It followed the writers' rejection Sundayof the producers' final contract offer.   Talk shows and soap operas would be the first to feel theeffects of the strike, probably turning to reruns, the union said.Producers said other shows had stockpiled scripts.   The WGA strike is the fourth since a 17-week walkout in 1973.The longest, in 1981, lasted three months.</TEXT></DOC>
