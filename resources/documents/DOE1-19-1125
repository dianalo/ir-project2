The general purpose of the project has been outlinedelsewhere. The samples are derived from the U.S. National Petroleum Reserve,Alaska (NPRA). This study, as the authors understood it, is qualitativeoil-to-rock correlation work; i.e., they infer that all rocks which havebeen submitted for correlation are potential source rocks. This is supportedby the fact that, with few exceptions, all rocks are high in their organiccarbon content. Therefore, they restricted their investigations to generalorganic geochemical as well as biomarker and stable isotope correlationtechniques.</TEXT></DOC>
