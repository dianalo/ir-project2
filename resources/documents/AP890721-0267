Federal regulators pledged $250 million to National BancsharesCorp. of Texas in San Antonio less than 24 hours after bailing outTexas American Bancshares Inc. in Fort Worth with $900 million.   Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh will take over the SanAntonio-based holding company, which owns 12 banks with assets of$2.3 billion and deposits of $2.2 billion.   Late Thursday, the FDIC announced Deposit Guaranty Bank ofDallas would take over 24 subsidiary banks owned by Texas American.The subsidiaries will be part of Texas American Bridge Bank, anFDIC-created entity, until Deposit Guaranty's acquisition iscomplete.   The Texas American transaction involved the closure of 24 banks,raising the total number of Texas bank closings this year to 95.Since 1984, 290 Texas banks have failed. Nationwide, 131 banks havefailed this year.   But Texas American objected to the planned arrangements, sayingit intended to file lawsuits against the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency and the FDIC.   Frank Anderson, a banking analyst for Stephens Inc. in LittleRock, Ark., said the deals end the problems for Texas' large banks.   ``A vital and important step in the recovery of Texas is gettingthese banks recapitalized,'' Anderson said. ``There must be avehicle for raising capital, for business to expand and newcompanies to come in.   ``We're already seeing visible signs of recovery, especially inHouston. I'm highly encouraged,'' Anderson said.   Bob Walters, executive vice president of Sheshunoff InformationServices Inc. in Austin was less optimistic, but he agreed thesigns are positive.   ``I don't think it necessarily means anything is going to getback going again. The FDIC and FSLIC (Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp.) still have a bunch of problems out there,''Walters said.   And, he said, it will take a change in perception _ that peoplestart thinking Texas is a good place to do business.   ``But, is this a step in the right direction? Yes,'' he said.   With the resolution of the Texas American and NationalBancshares deals, each of Texas' nine largest holding companieshave found new owners in the past three years. Deposit Guaranty wasthe only Texas company to become owner of one of the problem banks.   ``Obviously we're excited,'' Deposit Guaranty Chairman RobertSteinhart said of the Texas American acquisition. ``We have aunique opportunity here ... We see an opportunity for a Texas-basedbank and Texas-managed bank.''   James H. McLaughlin, president of Equibank, which has $3.7billion in assets, will become National Bancshares' chief executive.   Equimark is contributing $31 million to the National Bancsharestransaction and, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, EquiManagementInc., will own about 44 percent of National Bancshares' stock.Another $86 million is being raised from other investors throughprivate placements of preferred and common stock.   National Bancshares' existing stockholders will retain a 2percent stake in the rescued bank.   National Bancshares recorded a net loss for 1988 of $189.1million compared with a net loss of $64.0 million for 1987 and$32.1 million for 1986, according to the company's 1988 annualreport.   Before the Texas American transaction, Deposit Guaranty hadpurchased 14 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisteddeals with protection from regulators on losses.   Deposit Guaranty's previous largest acquisition had been the$186 million Bank of Dallas in February 1988, financed with $70million in investor capital raised by Steinhart.   Several of the other large banks have been acquired byinstitutions in Illinois, Michigan, California and Minnesota.   Anderson said he believes out-of-state ownership will strengthenthe Texas banking system and make it more competitive, to thebenefit of consumers.</TEXT></DOC>
