The failed bank's only office will reopen today as a branch of First Interstate. Heritage Bank, with total assets of $17.6 million, was closed yesterday by state authorities and the FDIC was named receiver.    At the time the bank was closed, it had deposits of about $16 million in 4,000 accounts. The FDIC believes that all deposits are within the federal insurance limit of $100,000 per depositor.    First Interstate is paying the FDIC a premium of $51,000 for the right to receive the transferred deposits and will purchase other assets of the failed bank for $8.9 million.    Heritage was the 67th bank to fail nationwide this year and there have been two assisted transactions. It was the second Utah bank to fail in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
