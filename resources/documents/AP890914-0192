Researchers who analyzed data on 7,954 people found that 40percent of those with insomnia and 46.5 percent of those who sleepexcessively, a condition called hypersomnia, also had psychiatricproblmes.   Psychiatric problems included major depression, anxiety disorderssuch as phobias and panic attacks and alcohol abuse, the researchersreported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.   About 6 percent of the general adult population suffers fromserious sleep disturbances, the lead researcher, Dr. Daniel E. Fordof Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said in a telephoneinterview Thursday. Ford was with the National Institute of MentalHealth, which did the study.   Ford said it was not always clear whether the psychiatricdisorders caused the sleep disturbances or vice versa.   However, follow-up interviews a year after the initial screedingindicated that subjects with sleep disorders were much more likelyto develop new mental disorders, especially depression, thannon-sleep disturbed subjects, the researchers said.   For example, people who had insomnia at both the first and secondinterviews were almost 40 times more likely to develop majordepression than those who didn't, the study found.   Insomniacs also were more than six times as likely to developanxiety disorders and more than twice as likely to start abusingalcohol as peaceful sleepers.   ``Ultimately, answering the question of which comes first willrequire an intervention trial, in which you try to see if treatingthe sleep disorder reduces the number of people with anxiety ordepression,'' Ford said.   The 7,954 subjects were adults over 18 chosen from representativehouseholds in Baltimore, Los Angeles and Durham, N.C. Of thatnumber, 10.2 percent were insomniacs and 3.2 percent had hypersomnia.   The researchers used a ``fairly severe'' definition of sleepdisturbance, Ford said.   The disturbance must have been present for two or more weeks; itmust have prompted the subject to seek professional help or to takemedication; and it must have interfered with the subject's life ``alot,'' he said.   Ford said the connection between sleep disorders and psychiatricdisturbances isn't appreciated.   ``Only about 30 percent of the people that had sleep disturbancesthat saw a general physician said they discussed their mental healthcondition,'' he said.   An editorial accompanying the study in the Journal agreed, sayingthe high prevalence of psychiatric problems among people with sleepdisorders was a ``surprising result.''   The editorial, written by Dr. Charles F. Reynolds III of theUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, commended the study asbeing ``probably one of the most scientifically rigorous'' of itstype.   It is important because it may give doctors a new way to try tohead off some psychiatric problems before they develop, Reynoldssaid.   He encouraged health-care professionals to teach principles of``sleep hygiene'' to people with sleep problems, including keeping adaily log and adhering to a regular sleep schedule, teachingpatients how some medications can disrupt sleep, and even trainingsome insomniacs to limit their sleep hours to create a ``sleepdeficit'' that will promote continuous sleep after they do doze off.</TEXT></DOC>
