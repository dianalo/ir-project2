Approximately $500 million more in flood losses will be covered by the National Flood Insurance Program and &quot;Write Your Own&quot; insurance programs.    The industry trade group said the worst damage, an estimated $2.55 billion, occurred in South Carolina, where the coastal counties of Charleston, Horry, Georgetown and Berkeley were battered by the storm a week ago. Losses in North Carolina were estimated at $275 million, while insured losses in Georgia and Virginia were estimated at $1 million and $5 million respectively. More than 360,000 hurricane-related claims are expected.    In Puerto Rico, insured property losses were estimated at $700 million, and Virgin Islands losses were estimated at $450 million. </TEXT></DOC>
