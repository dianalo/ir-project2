Guards killed two prisoners during Tuesday night's jail raid atthe Welikade Prison, which prompted authorities to impose curfews inparts of Colombo and to appoint an army officer to oversee thecountry's prisons, the government said.   The attack on the medium-security prison housing about 1,500inmates was the second in as many weeks in Sri Lanka. On Dec. 4,suspected Sinhalese extremists dressed in army uniforms overpoweredguards at a prison in central Sri Lanka and freed six inmates.   A military spokesman who requested anonymity said Tuesday'sescape apparently was organized by the People's Liberation Front, anextremist Sinhalese group trying to topple the government anddisrupt the Dec. 19 presidential elections.   The military official said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threwsmall bombs at the south wall of the prison. The explosionsdistracted guards in other sections of the facility and allowedinmates to scale the walls and escape, they said. Guards openedfire, killing at least two inmates, the official said.   ``It was a well-organized operation, pre-planned and possiblydone with inside connivance,'' he added.   The 221 prisoners escaped in six vehicles, raided a laundry abouta half mile from the prison and changed their prison uniforms forcivilian clothes, the official said.   At least 15 escapees were caught early Wednesday about sevenmiles from the prison, he said.   The official said authorities believe other convicts reached thetown of Kelaniya, about five miles north of Colombo, and escaped byboat down the Kelani River.   The justice ministry said army Lt. Col. Vipul Boteju wasappointed to oversee all prisons in Sri Lanka.   On Wednesday, troops searched passenger buses and vehiclesentering the capital. Police imposed an indefinite curfew in thenorthern neighborhoods and searched homes for escapees.   The People's Liberation Front, which staged a coup attempt in1971, opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year-oldinsurgency by Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland inthe north and east provinces.   The Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, make up 75 percentof the island's 16 million people and control the government and themilitary. The Tamils, who are Hindu and make up 18 percent of thepopulation, claim they are denied jobs and education by theSinhalese.   The front contends the government has offered too manyconcessions to the Tamils in a peace accord signed in July 1987.Since then, the Sinhalese militants have been blamed for the murdersof more than 900 people, most of them government supporters.</TEXT></DOC>
