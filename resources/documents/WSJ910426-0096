The unexpected flap reveals the division in the Bushadministration over any action that could be seen asfurthering industrial policy. &quot;There's still ambiguity in theWhite House about how far they want to go in endorsing aneffort to direct the industrial sector,&quot; said House ScienceCommittee Chairman George Brown (D., Calif.).</LP><TEXT>   The controversy surfaced yesterday after a single sentencewas inserted in printed versions of the report, which cited22 technologies as critical to economic prosperity andnational security. The sentence, which read: &quot;The viewsexpressed in this report are solely those of the NationalCritical Technologies Panel,&quot; was missing from photocopiedversions of the report that the White House circulated onCapitol Hill and around Washington last week.   Rep. Brown called the sentence a &quot;disclaimer,&quot; and Sen.Jeff Bingaman (D. N.M.), who pushed for the panel inCongress, said he feared it indicated &quot;a lack of commitmentby the administration.&quot;   The technology panel was appointed by the White House'soffice of science and technology policy in response to arequirement from Congress. The panel was headed by anassociate director of the White House science office andincluded senior officials from the Defense Department,Commerce Department, other agencies and industry.Nevertheless, a White House science office spokeswomanyesterday said, &quot;they're not White House staff, so this isnot a White House report.&quot;   Technology analysts say they believe the report will beused as a way to direct federal dollars into research effortsrecommended by the panel. And at a hearing yesterday beforethe Science Committee, Robert White, the Commerceundersecretary for technology, indicated the administrationwould do just that. He said an interagency group is preparinga substantial research initiative for materials processing,one of the main technologies listed in the report, for thefiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
