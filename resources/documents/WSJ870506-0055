Last January, Mr. McKean decided not to seek reelection as the postal board's chairman; he has been severely criticized since last fall for a 1984 incident in which he recommended that the Postal Service hire a San Francisco law firm that was a client of his accounting business there.    Although the Justice Department decided that the matter didn't merit prosecution, a report by the Office of Government Ethics said Mr. McKean had demonstrated a misunderstanding or complete disregard for the standards. Mr. McKean's term on the board was to have expired in December 1991.    Rep. William Ford (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, and Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) have called for his resignation since the report. Mr. Levin is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Oversight of Government Management, part of the Governmental Affairs Committee.    Yesterday, Rep. Ford received a letter from Arthur Culvahouse, counsel to the president, informing Rep. Ford of Mr. McKean's resignation. Mr. McKean couldn't be reached for comment.    In February, Mr. KcKean was criticized in a General Accounting Office report for improperly using Postal Service funds to pay his lawyer when he testified at the 1984 confirmation hearings for Attorney General Edwin Meese. The GAO concluded that Mr. McKean's testimony didn't serve any official purpose for the agency and recommended that he repay the agency.    His testimony at that hearing involved a $40,000 loan he arranged for Mr. Meese, who later supported Mr. McKean's appointment to the postal board. Several investigations of the loan and the Meese-McKean relationship concluded that there wasn't any criminal activity involved.    The entire board of governors, on which there are 11 positions, is scheduled to appear before Rep. Ford today for an oversight hearing. Mr. McKean's role and continued service on the board had been expected to be a focus of the hearing.    Postal board governors are paid $10,000 annually for their services. </TEXT></DOC>
