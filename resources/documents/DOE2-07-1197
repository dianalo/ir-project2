In 18 (90%) of the 20 AVMsthere was a significant size reduction on angiography or MR imaging.Smaller AVMs (andless;8 cm/sup 3/) were more likely to resolve completely thanmedium-sized (8-32 cm/sup 3/) or larger AVMs (andgt;32 cm/sup 3/). Some postirradiationchanges were seen in the surrounding white matter in 80% of patientsstudied with MR imaging (11 cases). MR imaging revealed reduction andresolution of the vascular nidus as well as CT did, and delineated theextent of abnormal white matter and hemorrhage more precisely than didCT.</TEXT></DOC>
