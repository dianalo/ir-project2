Reduced radiation exposure to the patientand staff has been recently reported by implementing a new pulsed progressivescanning video system. We have shown that this system, which enablesthe pulsing of the X-ray generator at 30 pulses per second, results ina 50% reduction in radiation exposure. The technical parameters and implementationof a progressive scanning video system are discussed. Image quality,temporal and spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) wereassessed using conventional interlaced and progressive video scanning.These comparisons documented improved resolution, no degradation of ejectionfraction measurements, improved clinical images, and a 1.0-dB improvementin the SNR with the progressive scanning. Progressive scanning videosystems reduce radiation exposure and provide an objective improvementin image quality over conventional scanning video systems.</TEXT></DOC>
