Workers by the thousands joined the students, giving thempopsicles and bread in their strongest act of support in 11 days ofprotests.   Beijing residents escorted the students on bicycles and foot andtried to shield them from soldiers and police, who had issued harshwarnings against marches.   But the security forces were unarmed, and although they pushedfiercely against advancing students in a vain effort to halt theirmarch, they did not use other force against them.   There was no immediate information on any injuries in the crush.   The march turned instead into a jubilant procession. For morethan 15 hours, the students marched through streets and underoverpasses jammed with thousands of applauding people. High-risedwellers leaned from their windows to watch, store clerks stood intheir doorways and the patients of one hospital emerged inblue-and-white-striped pajamas.   The march was the biggest and most dramatic action yet byBeijing students in their campaign for sweeping democratic reforms,including a free press and an end to corruption.   In Washington, the State Department called for restraint on thepart of Chinese authorities and hoped the demonstrations wouldremain peaceful.   ``The United States believes in and supports the right ofpeaceful assembly, including peaceful protest and the freedom ofexpression,'' department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweler said.   Even before the march ended, the government announced it waswilling to hold talks with the students ``at any time'' if thestudents return to their campuses and ``adopt a calm and reasonableattitude.''   However, a government spokesman quoted by the official XinhuaNews Agency said the talks should be conducted through officialstudent groups already rejected by the protesters asnon-democratic. The government calls the protesters' newly formedunions illegal.   Xinhua later quoted a city spokesman as saying many of thestudents' demands, such as wiping out corruption, were ``in accordwith the wishes of the party and the government.'' The spokesman,who was not identified, urged the students to return to class,disband their illegal organizations and stop agitating.   Protest leaders did not immediately respond.   Other government statements read on the evening TV newsemphasized the need for stability for China to develop and accusedsome protesters of trying to overthrow the party and government.   The students have called for Premier Li Peng to resign and saysenior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, is too old to rule.   Most students say their campaign is not anti-government and theyonly want the leaders to do their job better and respect humanrights.   The march was the biggest since the communists took power in1949.   Student protests in 1986-87 resulted in the ouster of reformerHu Yaobang as Communist Party chief. Hu's death on April 15 touchedoff the new protests.   ``The government has lost face,'' said one student as marcherssurged onto Tiananmen Square, the symbolic seat of power in China.   It was not clear what the next step in the protest would be.   The students say they plan another march Thursday, the 70thanniversary of China's first student movement for democracy.   At least 75,000 students from 20 schools took part in the morethan 20-mile march.   The government warned Wednesday that the march would be illegal,and Chinese sources had reported soldiers were brought into thecity from outlying counties.   ``We fear nothing,'' read one of hundreds of banners waved bythe students.   The marchers met the first police barricade a half-mile from itsstart at Quinghua University, but the students managed in 15minutes of violent shoving to press through three rows of police.   ``It was like watching an iron bar bend,'' one viewer said.   Five more police lines were breached in the same way. Police atone barricades sent the students through with pats on the back, andseveral officers told the youths, ``We understand you. We won't hityou.''   At one point bystanders rushed to surround police trucks thatpulled up beside the marchers. ``Don't hit the students!'' thecrowd chanted.   A similar scene occurred at Tiananmen Square, when a dozentrucks filled with soldiers pulled up in the marchers' path. Dozensof people climbed onto the sides of the trucks.   ``Welcome 38th Army!'' they shouted, handing the soldiersstudent protest leaflets.   Students also gave out copies of a letter written in English tothe U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, asking``in this moment of top emergency ... for sympathetic understandingand moral support.''</TEXT></DOC>
