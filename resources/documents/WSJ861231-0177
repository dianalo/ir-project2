Terms weren't disclosed.    With the purchase, PepsiCo's bottling division will sell about a third of the company's U.S. soft-drink volume, up from about 31%. A few years ago, bottlers owned by PepsiCo accounted for only about a fifth of its volume.    New Century, which has been run by the Campodonico family for more than 75 years, owns six bottling plants and nine warehouses, and employs about 1,000 people. It owns Pepsi bottling operations in Reno, Nev., and Eureka, Calif., and owns half of the Oroville, Calif., Pepsi-Cola bottling operation.    A spokesman said Pepsi decided to buy New Century when the Campodonicos said they wanted to get out of the bottling business. &quot;It's a very important market for us,&quot; the spokesman said. Neither company would disclose New Century's earnings or sales.    Craig Weatherup, president of PepsiCo's bottling group, said Pepsi is getting &quot;a well-managed bottling company in sound financial shape,&quot; as well as the benefit of years of community involvement by the Campodonicos. </TEXT></DOC>
