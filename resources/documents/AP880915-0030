KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Democrats are calling on Republicanpresidential candidate George Bush to reverse course and supportstrong economic sanctions legislation against white-dominated SouthAfrica.   Just barely overcoming solid opposition from Republican members,the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the sanctions bill tothe full Senate on Wednesday on a 10-9 party line vote.   The bill would impose a trade embargo against South Africa andrequire the withdrawal of most U.S. business investment until thatnation ends its apartheid system of forced racial separation.   A much milder sanctions bill was passed over President Reagan'sveto two years ago. But the Republicans who supported that stepapparently will refuse to embrace the present legislation.   Republicans have insisted Democrats are pushing sanctionslegislation in an election year to gain political advantage forDemocratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., quickly moved to cast the issuein political terms and called for Bush to support the bill.   ``We're not trying to embarrass the Republicans; they areembarrassing themselves and embarrassing the United States aswell,'' Kennedy told reporters.   Kennedy said Bush has undergone a number of ``election-yearconversions'' during the campaign, citing the candidate'sapparently changed positions on day care and increasing the minimumwage.   ``We have welcomed these election-year conversions on the partof Mr. Bush,'' Kennedy said. ``We would certainly welcome hissupport on this measure. He has indicated he wanted to broaden hismandate. He now has an excellent opportunity to speak to thatmeasure. We're asking for his help and support on this issue.''   Bush has opposed sanctions as unlikely to bring change in SouthAfrica and as a step that would remove all U.S. influence on theSouth African government. The 1988 Democratic platform labels SouthAfrica a ``terrorist state'' and Dukakis has supported a sanctionspolicy.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a principal author of thesanctions bill, told reporters that if Republicans maintain a solidfront against the measure it will be difficult to cut off athreatened filibuster against it or to override a near-certain vetoby Reagan should it clear the Senate.   So far, only one Republican, Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut,has announced support for the sanctions measure.   Cranston said the Senate's Democratic leadership might considerattaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some otherlegislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded Senate voteon sanctions before Congress adjourns next month.   Asked about the prospects for the bill, Cranston replied: ``I'mhopeful, but I make no predictions until I ascertain that we have asolid Republican Party against this action. ... If discipline isenforced on Republican senators, we have a problem.''   The bill would force American companies to withdraw from SouthAfrica six months to a year after its enactment. It imposes a banon exports to and imports from South Africa, with the exception ofa list of strategic minerals.</TEXT></DOC>
