The supplier of communications transmission capacity said it will purchase the senior convertible Series B shares for investment only; it said it isn't interested in taking over ALC. But once the transaction is completed, it will be entitled to elect two members of ALC's five-member board. If Communications Transmission exercises its option to buy senior convertible Class C shares at $15 each, it will be able to elect another member to ALC's board. Communications Transmission also can assign its option to someone else.    Communications Transmission said Allnet Communications Services Inc., ALC's operating unit, is a &quot;significant customer,&quot; representing about 25% of its revenue. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Communications Transmission's stock closed unchanged at $7; ALC's stock closed at $2.375, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
