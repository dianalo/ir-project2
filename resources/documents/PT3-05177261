No. 4,396,598.      5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalami     de having the following structure:      ##STR1##      is an intermediate compound in the production of Ioversol. The compound of      Formula I and its use in the production of ioversol is likewise disclosed      in U.S. Pat. No. 4,396,598 incorporated herein by reference.      5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalami     de, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,396,598, may be produced by adding      acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) to a N,N-dimethylacetamide solution of a      compound of the following structure:      ##STR2##      and stirring until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is then      diluted with 1,1,2-trichloroethane and extracted with aqueous sodium      bicarbonate solutions and aqueous sodium chloride solutions. </PAR><PAR>  The dilution procedure using 1,1,2-trichloroethane may alternatively be      carried out using an organic solvent such as, but not limited to, carbon      tetrachloride, dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-di-chloroethane,      1,1,2-trichloroethylene, 1,1,2-trichloro-ethane, 1,1,1trichloroethane and      tetrachloroethylene, but most preferably 1,1,2-trichloroethane. </PAR><PAR>  The procedure for producing      5-acetoxyacetamidoN,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamid     e has become well known in the art and heretofore required the use of      acetoxyacetyl chloride (AAC) for the intermediate synthetic step just      described. </PAR><PAR>  An improved procedure that eliminates the need for acetoxyacetyl chloride      (AAC) in the intermediate synthetic step used to produce      5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalami     de is desired as an alternate and/or a more cost efficient method of      producing Ioversol. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention      to meet these needs. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  One method of producing ioversol without the use of acetoxyacetylchloride      (AAC) begins with a solvent solution of      5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthal-amide(1).      Compound 1 may be prepared for use in this reaction by distilling off some      of the solvent to remove and/or reduce impurities, or alternatively, the      solvent solution may be used directly without distillation.      N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and chloroacetyl-chloride (CAC), which is an      impurity found in AAC, are then added to the      5-amino-N,N,-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(1) and      the solution is stirred at 37.degree. C. until the reaction is complete.      Hydrochloric acid is produced as a waste product of this reaction. The      DMAC present in the solution is mildly basic and thereby reacts with the      hydrochloric acid generated to form a DMAC complex. After dilution with an      organic solvent, the reaction solution is extracted with aqueous sodium      bicarbonate solutions and aqueous sodium chloride solutions. The resulting      5-(chloroacetamido)-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalam     ide(2)may be used without further purification as an intermediate in the      production of      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-trii     odoisophthalamide (Ioversol)(4) according to the reactions illustrated in      Scheme 1 below. The final product, ioversol (4), produced through the use      of CAC has an equivalent purity, approximately 95%, as that produced      through the use of the more costly solvent AAC.      ##STR3## </PAR><PAR>  Another method of producing ioversol using chloroacetylchloride (CAC)      instead of acetoxyacetylchloride (AAC) uses dried      5-amino-N,N,bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(5) which      normally serves as a precursor to      5-amino-N,N,bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(1) in the      ioversol process. Therefore, this particular method eliminates one step,      the production of      5-amino-N,N,-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(1), in      the production of ioversol(4). This step-saving method begins by adding      N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and chloroacetylchloride (CAC) to      5-aminoN,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide (5) and      stirring until the reaction is complete. (4-dimethyl-aminopyridine (DMAP)      may also be used as a catalyst and added to compound (5) along with the      DMAC and CAC although it is not necessary.) Hydrochloric acid is produced      as a waste product of this reaction. After dilution with an organic      solvent, the reaction solution is extracted with aqueous sodium      bicarbonate solutions and aqueous sodium chloride solutions. The resulting      pentachloro-derivative of      5-acetoxyacetamido-N,N,-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalami     de(6) may be used without further purification in the production of      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-tri     iodo-isophthalamide(Ioversol)(4)according to the reactions illustrated in      Scheme 2 below.      ##STR4## </PAR><PAR>  Both of the above-described processes have the advantage of eliminating the      need for acetoxyacetyl chloride in the intermediate synthetic steps used      in the production of      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-trii     odoisophthalamide (Ioversol). Elimination of acetoxyacetyl chloride and      substitution with chloroacetylchloride (CAC) is important to reduce the      costs of production, to decrease impurities and to provide alternative      routes of production for      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-trii     odoisophthalamide(4). Additionally, the need for acetic anahydride is      likewise eliminated through the process illustrated in Scheme 2 which      reduces the cost of production even further. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  5-chloroacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide     (2) may be prepared according to the present invention by first distilling      off some of the solvents from      5-amino-N,N,-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(1) to      reduce and/or remove any solvent impurities therefrom. This distillation      of solvent(s) from compound 1 is optional. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC)      and chloroacetylchloride (CAC), an impurity found in AAC, are then added      to the previously distilled solution and stirred until the acylation      reaction is complete. The solution which is highy viscous is then diluted      to improve fluidity, and thereby ease workability, with an organic solvent      such as for example toluene, a halocarbon solvent or a chlorocarbon      solvent. Examples of such solvents include but are not limited to carbon      tetrachloride, dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane,      1,1,2-trichloroethylene, 1,1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and      tetrachloroethylene, but preferably 1,1,2-trichloroethane. </PAR><PAR>  After dilution, the solvent is extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate      solutions (preferably containing approximately 10-15% sodium bicarbonate)      and/or aqueous sodium chloride solutions (preferably containing      approximately 10-15% sodium chloride). This usually results in a mixture      of 5-chloroacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthala     mide(2) in 1,1,2-trichloroethane at approximately 25 to 30 percent solids.      The resulting      5-chloroacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamid     e(2) may be used as an intermediate to produce      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-trii     odoisophthalamide (Ioversol)(4) as illustrated in Scheme 1 above. The same      is true for the production of      N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-trii     odoisophthalamide (Ioversol)(4) from      5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide(5)      stirred with chloroacetylchloride (CAC), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and      optionally 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This reaction is likewise      illustrated in Scheme 2 above. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention as described above is further illustrated by the      following examples, but is not intended to be limited thereby. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  The Preparation of      5-chloroacetamido-N,N'-bis-(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalami     de </PAC><PAR>  A solution of      5-amino-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide (69.8 g)      in 1,1,2-trichloroethane was prepared (total volume 177 ml).      N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) (17.4 ml) and chloroacetyl chloride (CAC)      (18.1 g) were added to the reaction flask and the reaction was stirred      until the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was then diluted by      approximately a factor of 3 with 1,1,2-trichloroethane (82 ml) and      extracted with aqueous approximately 10% sodium bicarbonate solutions (313      ml:31 g NaHCO.sub.3) and aqueous approximately 10% sodium chloride      solutions (145 ml:14.5 g NaCl). The resulting solution of      5-chloroacetamido-N,N'-bis(2,3-diacetoxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamid     e(2) is used as an intermediate in the production of ioversol without      further purification. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  The Preparation of      5-chloroacetamido-N,N-bisandlsqb;2,3di(chloroacetoxypropyl)andrsqb;-2,4,6-triiodoisophth     alamide </PAR><PAR>  N,N-dimethylacetamide (75.2 ml), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.005 g moles,      0.61 g) and granular      5-amino-N,Nbis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide (0.1 g      mole, 70.5 g) are placed into a 500 ml, 3-necked round bottomed flask. The      mixture is stirred and heated to approximately 55.degree. C. to dissolve      the solids. Chloroacetylchloride (0.55 g mole, 62.1 g) is added slowly      with stirring and the reaction temperature is controlled at      50.degree.-70.degree. C. After completing the addition, the reaction      solution is allowed to stir at approximately 60.degree. C. to complete the      reaction, approximately 3 hr. </PAR><PAR>  After the reaction is completed, 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TCE) is added      (approximately 152 ml) diluting the solution by approximately a factor of      3 and the solution is stirred and cooled to approximately 20.degree. C.      Stirring and cooling are continued and aqueous sodium carbonate solution      (approximately 0.6 moles, 52 g in a 13% w/v solution is slowly added to      the stirred TCE solution at a rate which will maintain the temperature at      less than 27.degree. C. After stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction      mixture containing TCE, DMAC, CAC,      5-amino-N,N-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide is      transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated from      the aqueous layer. The organic layer is washed with a 10% w/v sodium      chloride solution in a similar manner. The resulting TCE solution of the      product is suitable for conversion to      N,N-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-andlsqb;N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycolamidoandrsqb;-2,4,6-triio     doisophthalamide (Ioversol) as shown above. </PAR><PAR>  The process of the present invention is less expensive, easier to perform      and results in fewer impurities. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  Accordingly, having described our invention, we claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
