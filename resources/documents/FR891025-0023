On June 30, 1989, we presented a supplemental/deficiencyquestionnaire to the Government of Venezuela. On July 14, 1989, we receiveda response from Suflatos del Orinoco, C.A. (SULFORCA). On July 17, 1989,we received a partial response from the Government of Venezuela. On July21, 1989, we received a response from the Government of Venezuela concerningSULFORCA's raw material suppliers.On July 20, 1989, petitioner filed a request for alignment of the countervailingduty and antidumping duty final determinations. Pursuant to section 705(a)(1)of the Act, we extended the final determination date in this investigationto no later than October 18, 1989 (54 FR 33254, August 14, 1989).On August 7, 1989, we presented an additional supplemental/deficiency questionnaireto the Government of Venezuela. On August 21, 1989, we received responsesfrom the Government of Venezuela and SULFORCA. This August 21, 1989 submissionincluded cost of production information for aluminum hydrate requestedin our June 30, 1989 supplemental/deficiency questionnaire. On August 31,1989, we returned as untimely this cost of production information pursuantto andSection;andSection; 355.2(g), 355.31 (a)(3) and (b)(2) of the new countervailingduty regulations (published on December 27, 1988 as 53 FR 52306 to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.2(g), 355.31 (a)(3) and (b)(2). We conducted verificationof the questionnaire responses of the Government of Venezuela and SULFORCAin Venezuela from August 28 to Setpember 12, 1989.Petitioner and SULFORCA requested a public hearing in this case on July7, 1989 and July 21, 1989, respectively, which was held on October 6, 1989.On September 29, October 2, and October 4, 1989, we received case briefsand rebuttal briefs filed on behalf of petitioner and SULFORCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is aluminum sulfate from Venezeuela,which is used in water purification, in waste waster treatment, and forother industrial applications. Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandisewas classifiable under item 417.1600 of the ``Tariff Schedules of the UnitedStates Annonated.'' This merchandise is currently classifiable under HTSitem 2833.22.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of this investigation, the period for which we are measuringsubsidies (``the review period'') is calendar year 1988. When completedata for the calendar year were not available, we used company fiscal yeardata as indicated. We have based our determination on our analysis of thepetition, the responses to our questionnairies, verification, and writtencomments filed by petitioner and SULFORCA.At verification, we found that another producer of aluminum sulfate inVenezuela exported to the United States during the review period. Thisproducer, identified as Ferroaluminio, C.A. (FERRALCA) by the Governmentof Venezuela in its July 17, 1989 response, failed to respond to our requestsfor information. As FERRALCA did not respond to any of our questionnaires,we were unable to determine whether it used any of the programs includedin this investigation. Therefore, we have determined, in accordance withsection 776(c) of the Act, that the use of the best information availableis appropriate. Section 776(c) requires the Department to use the bestinformation available ``whenever a party or any other person refuses oris unable to produce information requested in a timely manner, or in theform required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation.'' Forthe purposes of this investigation, we have assigned FERRALCA the country-widerate calculated in the ``Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination:Certain Electrical Conductor Redraw Rod from Venezuela'' (53 FR 24763,June 30, 1988) (Redraw Rod) as the best information available. We havedetermined that the country-wide rate calculated for the purposes of RedrawRod is the best information available as it is the most recently completedVenezuelan countervailing duty investigation.I. Program Determined to Confer a SubsidyWe determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers, producers,or exporters in Venezuela of aluminum sulfate under the following program:<ITAG tagnum="81">Preferential Pricing of Aluminum Hydrate</ITAG>Petitioner alleged that a government-owned firm, Interamerican de Alumina,C.A. (INTERALUMINA), is providing aluminum hydrate to SULFORCA at a preferentialrate. We have learned the following, based on the responses and verification.INTERALUMINA is an integrated aluminum reserve owned by the Governmentof Venezuela through the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and theVenezuelan Investment Fund (FIV). INTERALUMINA's principal product is alumina.Aluminum hydrate is extracted at the filtration stage in the productionof alumina. Past the filtration stage, further processing in the form ofcalcination takes place to produce alumina.The extracted aluminum hydrate is sold to two customers in Venezuela, SULFORCAand FERRALCA. These two purchasers are the only producers of aluminum sulfatein Venezuela. The price charged these two customers differ. FERRALCA paysthe same price INTERALUMINA charges to customers purchasing small quantitiesof alumina. The price INTERALUMINA charges for alumina generally is setby reference to INTERALUMINA's cost of producing alumina plus related costsidentified in its financial statements. FERRALCA purchases aluminum hydratepursuant to purchase orders which set the price and total quantity.The price paid by SULFORCA for aluminum hydrate was established in a long-termcontract entered into between INTERALUMINA and SULFORCA in August 1988,and is lower than the price paid by FERRALCA. INTERALUMINA officials' explanationfor SULFORCA's lower price was that the price reflects (1) the expectationthat SULFORCA will purchase larger quantities of aluminum hydrate thanFERRALCA, and (2) SULFORCA's status as a new company in a developing industry.In analyzing whether the government's provision of aluminum hydrate constitutesa countervailable benefit, we must first determine whether it is providedto a ``specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,''as required by section 771(5)(ii) of the Act. Because the government, throughINTERALUMINA, provides aluminum hydrate at a particular price only to onecompany, SULFORCA, we determine that this government action is directedas a ``specific enterprise'' within the meaning of the Act.Having determined that the provision of the price for aluminum hydrateis specific to SULFORCA, the next issue we must address is whether thatprice is preferential. Pursuant to section 771(5)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act,the Department determines whether the government provision of a good orservice confers a countervailable benefit by comparing the government priceunder scrutiny to a benchmark price. That benchmark price will normallybe a non-specific price that the government charges to other users of thegood in the same political jurisdiction. For the purposes of this investigation,we have determined that the price INTERALUMINA charged FERRALCA for itspurchase of aluminum hydrate is the appropriate benchmark price.In determining the appropriate benchmark price, we considered our applicationof this provision of the Act in past determinations. for example, in ``CarbonBlack from Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty AdministrativeReview'' (51 FR 13269, April 18, 1986), (Carbon Black), the two purchasersof the government provided input paid the same price for the input. Therefore,it was necessary for the Department to go beyond its traditional measureof preference, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether the government charges different prices to differentusers within the jurisdiction, and to examine the alternative measuresof preference in the ``Preferentiality Appendix,'' which was attached toCarbon Black.In this case, however, the two purchasers of aluminum hydrate are payingdiferent prices. After comparing the quantities and terms of SULFORCA'scontract to the quantities and terms of FERRALCA's purchase orders, wedetermined that these did not provide a basis for justifying the pricedifference involved. Also, according the INTERALUMINA officials, SULFORCA'sstatus as a new firm in a developing industry was taken into account insetting its price.Consistent with our traditional measure of preferentiality, we have determinedthat the price paid by FERRALCA for aluminum hydrate is the proper benchmarkfor determining whether SULFORCA is receiving this input at preferentialrates. Regardless of whether the price INTERALUMINA charged FERRALCA isspecific, we have carefully examined the price and believe that it providesthe best measure of preference in this situation.First, as noted above, FERRALCA is charged the same price that small quantitypurchasers pay for alumina purchased from INTERALUMINA. This is despitethe fact that further processing occurs in the production of alumina. secondly,the alumina price and, hence, the price paid by FERRALCA for aluminum hydrate,is set on the basis of INTERALUMINA's production and financial costs. Therefore,we have no reason to believe that the price aluminum hydrate charged toFERRALCA is preferential.We recognize the potential difficulties in using the price charged to onepurchase as the measure of preference implicit in the price charged toanother purchaser. For example, one purchaser might be charged only a veryslight premium so that the lower price would not appear to confer a benefiton the company paying that lower price. However, for the reasons describedabove we are satisfied in this case that the price charged to FERRALCAis not preferential and, therefore, can serve as a benchmark for determiningwhether aluminum hydrate has been provided to SULFORCA on preferentialterms.Absent complete data for the review period, calendar year 1988, we basedour calcuation on SULFORCA's fiscal year data. To calculate a benefit toSULFORCA, we multiplied the resultant price differential by the total amountof aluminum hydrate purchased during the fiscal year. We then divided theresultant figure by SULFORCA's total domestic and export sales figure asreported in its financial statements. On this basis, we calculated an estimatednet subsidy of 19.03 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for SULFORCA.II. Programs Determined Not to Confer SubsidiesWe determinme that subsidies are not being provided to manufacturers, producers,or exporters in Venezuela of aluminum sulfate under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Preferential Pricing of Sulfuric Acid</ITAG>Sulfric acid is one of the primary inputs in the aluminum sulfate productionprocess. Petroquimica de Venezuela, S.A. (PEQUIVEN), a state-owned company,is the only producer of sulfuric acid in Venezuela. PEQUIVEN supplies sulfuricacid to companies in a large number and broad range of industries, includingthe aluminum sulfate industry.At verification, we established that all customers paid the same pricefor sulfuric acid purchased from PEQUIVEN, including companies producingaluminum sulfate. Because the slufuric acid PEQUIVEN produces, and theprice it changes, is provided to a wide range of industries, we deteminethat this program is not countervailable.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Preferential Pricing of Electricty</ITAG>C.V.G. Electrification del Caroni, C.A. (EDELCA) is a state-owned hydroelectricpower company. We verified that EDELCA uses a primary rate schedule todetermine that rate it charges to all small and medium size companies withtheir own transformers, such as SULFORCA.At verification, we established that the rates charged to SULFORCA duringthe review period were consistent with the rates charged to other smalland medium size companies. Because the electricity EDELCA supplies, andthe rate it charges, is provided to a large number and broad range of industries,we determine that this program is not countervailable.III. Programs Determined Not to Be UsedBased or verified information, we determine that manufacturers, producers,or exporters in Venezuela of aluminum suflate did not apply for, claim,or receive benefits during the review period for exports of aluminum sulfateto the United States under the program listed below. These programs weredescribed in the preliminary determination in this investigation unlessotherwise noted.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Multiple Exchange Rate System</ITAG>From January through October 1988, there was a unified rate of 14.50 bolivares[(Bs.), the Venezuelan currency] to the dollar for purchasing imports,exchanging export earnings, and the repayment of foreign debt obligations.On October 19, 1988, Decree 2484 allowed exporters who waived their rightto use the export bond program, to purchase imports at the rate of 14.50Bs. to the dollar and exchange export earnings at the free market rate.Decree 2484 also permitted the repayment of foreign debt obligations toremain at the fixed rate for any company incorporated before 1983. In March1989, Decree 76 eliminated the multiple exchange rate system establishedby Decree 2484 and the fixed exchange rate for purchasing imports and exchangingexport earnings. Pursuant to this decree, all subsequent foreign exchangetransactions would be at the free market rate.At verification, we established that SULFORCA did not apply for the exportbond program and, therefore, did not waive the right to the export bondprogram in order to exchange export earnings at the free market rate. Weverified that SULFORCA did not purchase imports, exchange export earnings,or repay foreign debt obligations at the fixed rate from October 1988 throughDecember 1988. We also established that SULFORCA did not exchange any exportearnings until May 1989, when the free market rate was the only availablerate in Venezuela. Based on the above, we determine that SULFORCA did notuse the multiple exchange rate system during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Export Bond Program</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">C.

Program Determined Not to ExistBased on verified information, we determine that a sales tax exemptionfor manufacturers, producers, or exporters of aluminum sulfate from Venezueladoes not exist.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG>All written comments submitted by the interested parties in this investigation,which have not previously been addressed in this notice, are addressedbelow.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner claims that SULFORCA's ability to convertits exhange rate earnings at the free markets rate during a period in whichmajor elements of its costs were determined by the official rate constitutesan export subsidy equal to the differential between the two exchange rates.Petitioner aruges that the Government of Venezuela gave SULFORCA accessto the free market exchange rate to convert export earnings even thoughits cost structure, including purchases of basic raw materials and productionequipment, was built on the official 14.50 Bs. to the dollar exchange rate.Petitioner further contends that SULFORCA was able to lower its costs becausea large portion of its depreciation costs during the review period wasbased upon the official exchange rate. Additionally, petitioner contendsthat the sharp increase in prices for goods and services in Venezuela asa result of the March 1989 reforms in the Venezuelan economy rebuts anycontention that SULFORCA was operating in Venezuela on the basis of thefree market exchange rate during the review period.Respondent states that SULFORCA used the free market rate for all purposesduring the review period and only recently exchanged export earnings. Theseexport earning were exchanged at a time when the free market rate was requiredfor both export conversion and import purchases. Further, the officialrate has not been available for the purchase of imports since the fallof 1988, and was subsequently abolished for all purposes in March 1989.Therefore, respondent argues, there is no basis for the Department to concludethat the change from the fixed to the floating exchange rate system constituteda countervailable benefit.<T3>DOC Position: See </T3>section III.A. of this notice for a discussionof the exchange rates used by SULFORCA during the review period.With respect to the treatment of depreciation costs and the exchange rateused for basic raw materials, petitioner raises these issues for the firsttime in its September 29, 1989 case brief. Pursuant to andSection; 355.31(c)of the new regulations [to be codified 19 CFR 355.31(c)], the Departmentwill not consider any subsidy allegation submitted less than 40 days priorto the preliminary determination. Thus, we consider these allegations tobe untimely and not subject to comment by the Department in this finaldetermination.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner contends that the price SULFORCA paid INTERALUMINAfor aluminum hydrate in 1988 was preferential when compared to any of thebenchmarks in the ``Preferentiality Appendix.'' However, petitioner arguesthat the price at which INTERALUMINA sold aluminum hydrate to FERRALCAis the appropriate benchmark for determining the degree of preferentiality.Respondent contends that SULFORCA does not purchase aluminum hydrate fromINTERALUMINA at subsidized rates and, therefore, there is no preferentialpricing. However, if the Department were to determine that there is a countervailablesubsidy relating to the provision of aluminum hydrate, the only benchmarkavailable for calculating such an alleged subsidy would be INTERALUMINA'sverified cost of production figures. Respondent does not specifically commenton the use of FERRALCA's price as a benchmark, rather, respondent contendsthat the Department could not use a ``world price'' to calculate a subsidybecause aluminum hydrate is not a commodity but a specialized intermediateproduct for which there is no ``world price.'' Moreover, because of plentifulraw materials and labor, the price of aluminum hydrate in Venezuela bearslittle relation to a world price.<T3>DOC Position: See </T3>section I. of this notice. With respect to INTERALUMINA'scost of production information, we returned this portion of the Government'sresponse as untimely. Therefore, we did not verify INTERALUMINA's costof production for aluminum hydrate. Pursuant to section 776(b)(1) of theAct, the Department will only consider verified information for the purposesof a final determination. (<T3>See </T3>Case History section of this notice for further discussion.)<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Petitioner alleges that if the Department assumes thatPEQUIVEN operated on an official rate of exchange, the price charged toSULFORCA for sulfuric acid should not be considered preferential. But,according to petitioner, the price at which SULFORCA purchased sulfuricacid from PEQUIVEN is preferential if PEQUIVEN's price is converted todollars at the free market rate. Petitioner further argues that if theGovernment of Venezuela had responded to the Department's requests forinformation on the prices at which other companies sold sulfuric acid withinVenezuela, there would have been a more reliable basis by which to determinepreferentiality. Petitioner suggests that the Department use the priceat which PEQUIVEN imports sulfuric acid as a benchmark to determine whetheror not PEQUIVEN's price is preferential. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>At verification, we found that PEQUIVEN, the onlysupplier of sulfuric acid in Venezuela, did not import sulfuric acid during1988. Furthermore, the Department does not consider the exchange rate usedby input supplies when investigating preferential pricing of inputs. Forfurther discussion regarding preferential pricing of inputs, <T3>see </T3>DOC Position to <T3>Comment 1 </T3> above and section I., II.A, and II.B. of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determination. As mentioned previously, we usedthe best information available for FERRALCA, who did not participate inour investigation. During the verification, we followed standard verificationprocedures, including meeting with government and company officials; inspectinginternal documents and ledgers; tracing information in the responses tosource documents, accounting ledgers and financial statements; and collectingadditional information that we deemed necessary for making our final determination.Our verification results are outlined in the public versions of the verificationreports which are on file in the Central Records Unit (B-099) of the MainCommerce Building.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with Section 705(c) of the Act [19 U.S.C. 1671d(c)], we aredirecting the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entriesof aluminum sulfate from Venezuela which are entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of thisnotice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>and to require a cash deposit or bond in theamounts indicated below. As explained in the Analysis of Programs sectionof this notice, the estimated net subsidy rate for FERRALCA is based onthe best information available. Becasue we do not have the export statisticsfor FERRALCA to calculate a weighted-average country-wide rate, we areproviding a separate rate for FERRALCA. Therefore, the rate for all othermanufacturers, producers, or exporters in this investigation is the ratecalculated for SULFORCA .<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,9</C> <H1>Manufacturers/Producers/Exporters</H1><H1>Estimated net subsidy</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">FERRALCA <D>38.40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All Other Companies <D>19.03</D></ITAG></ITAG>This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination.
