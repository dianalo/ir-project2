The SDEIS (Tier-1) was necessitatedby the cancellation of the Centaur G (Shuttle version) and the subsequentreconfiguration of the missions to use the IUS and of Galileo to use aVenus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist (VEEGA) trajectory. Substantive publiccomments on the proposed action described in the SDEIS have been receivedand are being considered in the preparation of the Final EIS (Tier-1).Concurrent with the preparation of the Final EIS (Tier-1), NASA is preparinga DEIS (Tier-2), which will address the proposed action of completion ofpreparations and operation of the Galileo mission, including its plannedlaunch in October 1989.The Galileo Mission will study Jupiter, probe the Jovian planetary atmosphere,study the four major moons and the planet's extended electromagnetic environment.To gain sufficient velocity to reach Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft willfirst execute a Venus gravity-assist flyby and then two Earth gravity assistflybys. This trajectory is known as the VEEGA trajectory, and the analysisof the probability of an inadvertent reentry to Earth's atmosphere duringan Earth flyby will be in the Final EIS (Tier-1). The safety and environmentalimplications of the VEEGA trajectory will be treated in detail in the DEIS(Tier-2) for the Galileo Mission.The DEIS (Tier-2) for the Galileo Mission will address the proposed actionof completion of preparations and operation of the Galileo mission, includingits planned launch in October 1989, and the alternatives: (1) Delayingcompletion of preparations in favor of a launch in the 1991 opportunity,and (2) cancelling further work on the mission (i.e., the ``No Action''alternative). As part of the consideration of alternatives, the EIS willalso consider an alternative launch configuration, the Titan-IV/IUS expendablelaunch system.The environmental effects of these actions are those associated with thelaunch vehicle and those associated with the Galileo spacecraft. Environmentaleffects associated with the launch vehicle have been considered in thepreviously published EIS's on the Space Shuttle Program (1978), the KennedySpace Center (Revision 1979), and the SDEIS for the Galileo and UlyssesMissions (Tier-1) (1987).Potential environmental effects associated with the Galileo spacecraftare principally adverse health and environmental effects related to thepossible release of plutonium-238 from the spacecraft Radioisotope ThermoelectricGenerators (RTG's) and the Radioisotope Heater Units (RHU's) stemming from(1) an accident or mission abort during launch, or (2) reentry of the spacecraftfrom Earth orbit or during an Earth flyby. The potential effects associatedwith the Galileo spacecraft which will be considered in preparing the DEIS(Tier-2) for the Galileo Mission include impacts on air and water quality;local land area contamination by plutonium-238; adverse health and safetyimpacts; the disturbance of biotic resources; the occurrence of adverseimpacts in wetland areas or in areas containing historical sites; and socioeconomicimpacts. The analysis will use the latest information from a detailed FinalSafety Analysis Report currently being prepared by the Department of Energy(DOE). The DOE is participating as a cooperating agency in the preparationof this EIS because of the DOE's role in providing RTG's and RHU's andtheir responsibility for the safe operation of this power-source equipment.The DEIS is expected to be released for review in January 1989. Writtencomments or suggestions concerning the scope of this EIS are solicitedat this time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments in response to this notice must be received inwriting on or before October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Office of Space Science and Applications, Code E, NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. Dudley G.
