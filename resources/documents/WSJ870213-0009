Breaking with his longstanding practice of never disagreeing with President Reagan's decisions or describing his own advice in the White House, Mr. Bush said he is &quot;deeply troubled&quot; by evidence that the U.S. may have traded arms for hostages in violation of its own policy. The vice president stressed that he believes President Reagan didn't mean &quot;in his heart&quot; to trade arms for hostages.    Mr. Bush's comments, made yesterday to reporters during a Midwest swing to boost his 1988 presidential prospects, were a departure from his earlier remarks. In a Dec. 3 speech, for instance, he said he backed the president. While admitting that &quot;mistakes were made,&quot; he said that &quot;I was aware of our Iran initiative and I support the president's decision.&quot;    Asked at a news conference here yesterday if he had advised against the Iran deals as they went forward, Mr. Bush first brushed aside the question but added: &quot;Key players around there know that I express certain reservations on certain aspects.&quot; Craig Fuller, his chief of staff, later confirmed that he was referring to the Iran policy, but neither he nor Mr. Bush would elaborate.    Mr. Bush said that if investigators conclude that the U.S. swapped arms for hostages, &quot;I would be the first to say that is wrong.&quot; While minimizing his own decision-making role, he said the controversy has eroded his support for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination.    He said he couldn't &quot;pinpoint the date&quot; when he first learned about the policy and noted that a Senate Intelligence Committee report concluded he didn't attend the first meeting where it was discussed. &quot;I don't know that I had a specific role in making any determinations&quot; about the policy, he said.    He defended the Reagan administration's claim that it was dealing with Iranian moderates even though, according to a memo written by his own chief of staff, he was warned last July by an Israeli official that the deals were being made with Iranian radicals. He called it merely a difference of &quot;semantics.&quot; But Mr. Bush said, &quot;In looking back at it, it does raise a flag for me, but it didn't at the time, frankly.&quot;    In Washington, the Tower Commission, appointed by President Reagan to look into the Iran-Contra scandal, began to pore through transcripts of computer tapes of recorded conversations between members of the National Security Council.    The discovery of these tapes -- many of which remained in a central computer memory bank inside the White House without their authors' knowledge -- are the reason the commission needed a week's extension for its probe, Reagan administration officials said. On Wednesday, the panel was given until Feb. 26 to conclude its review -- a delay ascribed to the need to examine unspecified &quot;new material.&quot;    Reagan administration officials said the tapes included messages sent back and forth in recent months between Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was fired for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, and former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, who resigned as a result of the controversy surrounding the affair.    Many of the recorded messages were believed by their authors to have been deleted, but instead were automatically stored without their knowledge. Reagan administration officials suggested that the tapes further established links between the NSC and the private groups that funneled aid to the Nicaraguan rebels during the period when Congress had banned U.S. assistance.    In a related development, ABC News reported last night that one such group, directed by Carl Channell, designated a special account identified as the &quot;Toys Project&quot; that is believed to have funded arms for the Contras. Mr. Channell, a conservative activist, enjoyed high-level White House contacts, and on at least one occasion, according to ABC, brought in a group of big donors to meet with President Reagan, his chief of staff, Donald Regan, and Col. North.    On another occasion last August, Mr. Channell was one of about 15 guests called into the White House to give political advice to Mr. Regan in a strategy session on the 1986 midterm elections, a participant in the meeting recalled yesterday.    The ABC report cited no specific evidence that the $2.2 million reportedly raised during 1986 for the Toys Project actually bought weapons. But separately, intelligence sources said that among the multitude of companies and bank accounts linked to the Iran-Contra affair is one identified as Toyco S.A.    Those familiar with the records of Southern Air Transport said Toyco's name appears on payments made to the Miami-based air carrier, which was used in the Contra supply network. Previous checks in Switzerland and Panama, which are the bases of several companies used in the supply network, found no record of such a company being registered.    Last night, the White House had no comment on the ABC report other than to say &quot;the whole thing is under investigation.&quot; Earlier in the day, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to comment on any aspect of the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;I'm not qualified or willing to discuss the Iran situation,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said. </TEXT></DOC>
