As Christo tells Mr. Yashiro, he would like to erect a river of 1,500 huge blue umbrellas -- some, perhaps, in Mr. Yashiro's rice paddy, others in his neighbors' -- along this winding valley, while doing the same with yellow umbrellas in a valley outside Los Angeles. The project, which has already taken him two years of planning and will be executed in 1990, will contrast the life and landscapes of the two countries, he says. Three weeks after the umbrellas are erected, they will be dismantled.    In his most recent work, Christo -- whose endeavors are usually as cloaked in debate as in fabric -- wrapped the oldest bridge in Paris, the Pont Neuf, in golden material in 1985 after a 10-year fight with the city for permission.    Following spirited debates and court battles, he also won the right to envelop Florida islands in pink four years ago and fence off part of California with a rippling white curtain in 1976, although for 15 years he has failed to win approval to wrap the old Berlin parliament, the Reichstag.    Despite the fact that Christo pays for each of his multimillion dollar works with the sale of his prints and drawings, people have difficulty accepting his projects, he admits. Unlike most public art, which is built with &quot;tax money, corporate contributions and all the propaganda along with it,&quot; his projects are purely his individual expression.    &quot;Nobody needs 'Surrounded Islands,' nobody needs 'Running Fence.' The world can live perfectly well without umbrellas,&quot; he says. &quot;My work perhaps is folly, but it is totally my own.&quot;    To find a site in Japan for his umbrellas, Christo and his crew drove more than 8,000 miles across the mountainous land before discovering this quiet valley in Ibaraki prefecture, or province, just north of Tokyo but worlds away. Here, the roofs are thatched and rice fields and traditions have been passed from father to son for hundreds of years. As in California, Christo sought a valley in which the simple life had not changed.    During a warm October week, when ripe orange persimmons hung on the trees and sheaves of golden rice stood in the fields, he began to talk to Ibaraki farmers of his ideas.    Already the governor of Ibaraki and the mayors of the three towns affected have expressed support for the $8 million project, saying it will give the northern, more rural part of the prefecture publicity. &quot;Southern Ibarakiites practically believe they live in Tokyo,&quot; said Yosho Kurosawa of the prefectural government. &quot;But northern Ibaraki has no image.&quot;    In the north of Ibaraki, as in many rural parts of Japan, the young have been moving to the cities, leaving only grandparents to tend the farms, he said. People here hope Christo could help bring back their children.    Seeking official support was Christo's first move after locating a site and completing initial drawings. Unlike in the West, where grass-roots support could sway authorities, no umbrellas would sprout in Ibaraki without official blessing.    Still, the farmers' support is crucial too. &quot;We know that the government is more centralized than in the U.S.,&quot; says Henry Scott Stokes, a British author who is the project's director in Japan. &quot;But we also know that central government officials cannot bulldoze their way through something regardless of people's feelings.&quot;    At a meeting one night in Satomi, the smallest of the three towns involved, Mr. Kurosawa sits with Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude, and the mayor asks the audience of 55 to welcome the project. But the official show of support doesn't inhibit some skepticism from the mostly male congregation, some in jackets and ties, others in sweatsuits.    Christo, nervously at first then warming to his subject, talks of the project -- from the weight of the 18-foot-high umbrellas and his plans to test their wind resistance, to the reasons he chose them as the medium for this artwork.    &quot;Why umbrellas? I was thinking to find an object very familiar, architectural and strong to express the temporal nature of my work,&quot; says the Bulgarian-born artist who is now an American citizen. &quot;It's an old human object, an ancient object.&quot;    By placing the umbrellas in rivers and fields, beside houses and roads in the two valleys, he will show how differently the space is used in each country, he elaborates later.    &quot;The space of Japan is so complexly controlled -- every little square meter is preserved, used, kept,&quot; he says. &quot;In California, where space is abundant, the strong outdoor life reflects the whimsical, capricious nature of life.    &quot;I like to work in outdoor space {because} it's a space with a lot of contradiction . . . The moment you step outdoors, your life is funneled by somebody; your life is decided by someone else -- an urban planner, architect, politician.    &quot;All my projects have a frontier, a border, a territory which makes you rethink how you use that space . . . What I'm doing is creating gentle disturbances for a short time. I create a disturbance which will make you think.&quot;    Hashiro Fujita, a stout Satomi farmer, worries about a different sort of space, however. Does Christo know that last year at an international expo in southern Ibaraki, visitors parked on the rice paddies? he asks. And how will the new roads affect his work?    &quot;I will not change anything,&quot; answers Christo, gesturing constantly as he talks. &quot;But if the land is altered, I will change how I work.&quot;    Others in the fields occasionally express doubts, too, and one woman says she's &quot;uneasy&quot; about the idea. But as in the meeting, most are curious, not suspicious, and welcoming, not afraid.    &quot;I've never seen anything like this,&quot; an aproned Mrs. Yashiro confides to a visitor as Christo departs and her husband returns to work. &quot;But it seems interesting, and umbrellas are so very Japanese.&quot;    Christo and his crew know much remains to be done. Questions of insurance, traffic, environment, zoning and compensation remain on both sides of the ocean. In California, officials have expressed support, but a company that owns a major portion of the site has been cautious. And even in Japan, apparent support could fizzle.    &quot;In the meeting {in Satomi}, it felt like we had their permission,&quot; says Christo. &quot;But we will never have it on paper.&quot;    ---   Ms. Jackson is a reporter for the Associated Press in Tokyo. </TEXT></DOC>
