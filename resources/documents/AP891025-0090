Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said several military officerswere among those arrested in the past month. Lt. Gen. HamiltonWanasinghe, the army commander, said if the arrested are foundguilty ``they will be dealt with most severely.''   Wijeratne said among those arrested were five policemen in aColombo suburb on charges of raping a young Sinhalese woman theydetained for questioning after claiming she belonged to thePeople's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group.   Police arrested four army lieutenants who allegedly posed asfront members and tried to extort money from a wealthy businessmanin the town of Wellawatte just south of Colombo, said Wijeratne,who is also deputy defense minister.   The officials commented after The Sun, an independent newspaper,voiced concern about an increase in the number of serious crimesblamed on police.   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the Sinhaleseheartland of central and southern Sri Lanka since July 1987, whenthe government signed an Indian-brokered accord designed to end aninsurgency by Tamil militants in northeastern Sri Lanka.   The government has blamed most of the deaths on the front, whichhas assassinated fellow Sinhalese who serve or back the government.However, human rights activists, opposition politicians andreligious leaders say government forces and pro-governmentvigilante groups are responsible for many killings.   The People's Liberation Front accuses the government of sellingout the rights of the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese majority by makingtoo many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils, who are mostlyHindus, account for 18 percent and say they are discriminatedagainst.   Tamil guerrillas launched a series of massacres of Sinhalesecivilians. Those attacks, plus the ensuing war pitting theguerrillas against Sri Lankan soldiers and later Indianpeacekeepers, have claimed 11,000 lives since the Tamil separatistinsurrection began in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
