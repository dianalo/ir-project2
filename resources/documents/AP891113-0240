(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Boeing Co. pleaded guilty today totwo felony charges of ``unauthorized conveyance'' of secretPentagon budget documents and agreed to pay more than $5.2 millionin fines and restitution.   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III accepted the plea, entered byattorney Robert S. Bennett, after questioning company andgovernment lawyers for nearly an hour. He said he was concernedthat the plea and penalties agreed to might not sufficiently coverwhat he called ``a very serious breach of security.''   Ellis said he wanted a ``clear indication that the dispositionbears a rational relationship to the injury to the United Statesand reflects an awareness on the part of the Being Co. of thegravity of it.''   ``I want to be sure that the penalty is appropriate to what Iconsider to be a serious violation of the law,'' Ellis said.   The judge criticized Boeing for not sending a corporate officerfrom the Seattle-based aerospace firm to be present for the guiltyplea and sentence. ``I think you would have done well to havesomeone here to accept responsibility as officer of the company,''Ellis told Bennett.   The judge said he would require the corporation's board chairmanto write a letter to him expressing ``the typical contrition thatany defendant would express.''   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company didconsider sending a corporate officer to the hearing, but ``werelied on advice from counsel and followed court rules on how acompany enters a plea'' in deciding not to send an executiverepresentative. ``We did have representation from (Seattle-based)company senior counsel who has dealt closely with theinvestigation.''   ``Obviously we take this very seriously,'' Binder said. ``Ithink to put it in context, these are events that occurred from1978 until 1985 and I think from the time that it was discovered,we strengthened our procedures and internal controls and enhancedtraining to assure that similar incidents do not occur.''   Binder said ``there are no longer any employees with the companywho have been implicated'' in the case.   ``We have taken every step possible to assure that similarincidents do not occur,'' he said. ``The government said in theplea agreement that Boeing cooperated fully with the investigationand that the government has no evidence of any unlawful conveyanceof classified documents by Boeing after 1985.''   Binder said Boeing would send the letter ordered by Ellis. Thecompany's chairman and chief executive officer is Frank Shrontz.   Boeing had government contract sales in 1988 totaling $4.792billion, and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of this year,Binder said.   Ellis fined Boeing $20,000 and ordered it to pay $5.2 million inrestitution, which covers the cost of the government investigationand the value of the two documents that had been illegallyobtained. The figure also includes $200,000 worth of expensesBoeing incurred to keep former marketing analysis Richard Fowler onits payroll.   Fowler is awaiting trial on 39 counts of conspiracy and unlawfulconveyance of 107 classified documents to Boeing between 1979 and1985, including studies of President Reagan's Strategic DefenseInitiative.   Boeing admitted that it accepted two 1984 planning and budgetdocuments classified secret from Fuller, who is scheduled to go ontrial next month.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows said the JusticeDepartment is continuing its investigation to determine who in thePentagon gave the documents to Fowler, who had worked as a civilianAir Force employee before joining Boeing.   Ellis repeatedly pressed the prosecutor about whetherinvestigators were satisfied that no other Boeing officials couldbe prosecuted.   ``For a group of people in a company to know they have thesedocuments and take no action is fairly arresting,'' Ellis said.   Bellows said investigators were unable to prove that otherBoeing officials, including Fowler's immediate superior, knowinglyaccepted the classified documents in violation of the law.   The prosecutor said Boeing did not use the documents to obtain acontract, such as in the ``Ill Wind'' Pentagon procurement scandal.Instead the company used the information for general budget andplanning purposes.   Nevertheless, Bennett conceded, ``There is no question Boeingshould not have had these documents.''   ``Today, as far as the company is concerned, is a very sad dayin its history,'' Bennett said.   Bellows said a half-dozen current and former Boeing employeeshad been given immunity from prosecution in return for theircooperation in the case against Fowler. The prosecutor said thegovernment would seek a court order to revoke the securityclearances of those witnesses still working for Boeing.   Bellows noted that Boeing or some of its subsidiaries could besuspended or barred from receiving Pengaton contracts as a resultof the guilty plea. Air Force officials are reviewing the case, hesaid.   In addition, Bellows said prosecutors are investigating othercompanies whose employees also received Pentagon documents fromFowler. But is likely that the government will not be able toprosecute several of these companies because the statute oflimitations on the alleged offenses is about to expire, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
