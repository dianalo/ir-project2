 As both drive makers and independentexperts agree, good drives are pushing bad drives out of the market.andM;Nevertheless, even the best brands suffer occasional failures, and there havebeen a few recent instances of highly publicized problems with entire batchesor models of drives.andM;There are also quality differences in the cases, cabling and power suppliesas well as the software that drive-system makers add to the basic drivemechanism to turn raw drives into drive systems.andP;  Especially when it comes toexternal drive packages, there can be significant differences among models ofthe same capacity and class.andM;Natural selection.andP;  The basic drive mechanisms have shown the mostconvergence.andP;  &quot;It's evolution,&quot; explained Jim Porter, president of Disk/TrendInc. of Mountain View, Calif., and the industry's best-known analyst.andP;  Thecosts of defects to the distribution channel are so high -- particularly tosystem vendors and dealers -- that there is extreme pressure on the makers ofraw drives to keep up their quality.andM;&quot;At the beginning of the '80s, there were close to 30 firms in the U.S.andO;alone making drives for small computers,&quot; Porter said.andP;  &quot;Now, we have aboutsix left.andP;  The ones that survived are the ones that know what they're doing.&quot;andM;Still, default rates do differ.andP;  Unfortunately, initial failure rates of rawdrives are closely guarded numbers.andP;  Drive-subsystem makers who do completetesting of incoming drives report failure rates ranging from 1 percent fromthe best manufacturers to occasional, worst-case rates of 12 percent on somemodels from low-cost producers.andP;  Users must rely on published tests byneutral third parties (see story, this page) or seek information from usergroups and on-line services.andM;How good a raw drive a system maker gets also depends on what kind ofinfluence the company has with its suppliers, according to Eric Herzog,marketing manager for Storage Dimensions Inc. of San Jose, Calif.andP;  Companiesthat buy large numbers of drives, those with good testing procedures, or eventhose with historical and personal ties to executives of the major drivemakers get the top of the quality curve, while those with less influence getproducts closer to the cutoff.andM;The biggest companies in effect become partners with their suppliers.andP;  AtApple, according to Steve Wise, product line manager for storage and inputdevices, &quot;we actually get into the vendor's process.andP;  We have vendor qualityengineers in the field who go around and drop in on our vendors.andP;  At start-up[of a new model or new supplier relationship], we'll have engineers living atthe vendor's factory.&quot; Apple, he said, may even inspect the vendor's vendorto check on the quality of parts and components.andM;Testing, testing, testing.andP;  Qualifying suppliers for the mechanism iscertainly important, but even companies with the best supplier relationsagree that testing is the key to keeping bad drives from getting to endusers.andM;Just about everybody tests.andP;  And retests.andP;  Even companies that market on thebasis of low price have found it pays to do more testing rather than takemore returns.andM;&quot;We do 24-hour, high-temperature burn-ins,&quot; said Mike Ehman, president ofEhman Engineering Inc. of Evanston, Wyo.andP;  &quot;We have circuits that turn thedrive on and off 100 times; we also exercise the heads.&quot;andM;Ehman readily admits that when the company started, it concentrated mostly onlow price.andP;  By now, he said, it has learned that to keep prices low over thelong term, it makes sense to spend more money on testing.andM;However, even the best testing can't guarantee 100 percent operational rateson delivery.andP;  Between the drops and bumps that occur in shipping and thesmall number of random failures in electronic components, most drive-systemvendors say that the best companies may continue to have 1 percent to 2percent DOA rates.andM;Compatibility.andP;  While gross failures may be the most obvious sign of trouble,makers of many hard drive systems say they also spend a lot of time workingon their driver software and guarding against compatibility problems.andO;(Drivers are the invisible programs that connect the general Macintosh diskroutines to the specific characteristics of each drive).andP;  &quot;Everybody can makethe drives work,&quot; said Karl Seppala, director of Apple products for CMSEnhancements Inc. of Tustin, Calif.andP;  &quot;But the better the driver, the more thethroughput.andP;  You may see a 5 percent to 10 percent difference, which can bean important difference to a power user.&quot;andM;Furthermore, adherence to the SCSI standard Apple uses for connection betweenMacs and hard drives isn't enough to guarantee that two SCSI devices willwork together.andM;&quot;We keep a guy on staff full time who does nothing but compatibilitytesting,&quot; reported Tom Burke, vice president of sales and marketing at MirrorTechnologies Inc. of Roseville, Minn.andP;  System makers have to keep up not onlywith new machines from Apple but with other new peripherals and even changesin the firmware and drivers of other brands of disks.andM;Even cabling can play a part in compatibility.andP;  &quot;It used to be when everyoneowned one hard drive [and no other SCSI devices], if you had a weakness inthe cable, the signal was still good enough to get through,&quot; Ehman said.andO;Now, he explained, that's not good enough any more.andP;  His companies and mostof the better competitors have steadily upgraded their cabling during thepast few years.andM;Distribution.andP;  If hard drives always worked and compatibility were never anissue, there might not be any quarrels about which distribution channel isbest.andP;  But hard drives aren't toasters or even blank floppy disks.andM;Companies that prefer dealers say it's important to have local help and afinal local test after shipping.andP;  &quot;There are a lot of problems a goodretailer can handle,&quot; Storage Dimensions' Herzog said.andP;  For example, &quot;powersupplies and fans are real simple to replace,&quot; he said.andM;On the other hand, direct distributors say that normal installation can bedone by the user, few hard disk problems are actually fixed locally, and mostdealers don't have the specialized expertise to deal with the more obscureproblems.andM;&quot;We get so much good information talking [directly] with our end users,&quot; saidCharlie Kamerman, marketing director of La Cie Ltd. of Tigard, Ore.andP;  Betweenthe user reports and the diagnostics in his company's Silverlining software,he said, &quot;we can usually do a better diagnosis over the phone.&quot; And, headded, with overnight delivery services, turnaround with a direct-marketcompany can be just as fast as with a dealer.andM;If all hard disks aren't exactly alike, then how reliable are the publishedtests of the differences?andP;  Drive-system makers advise users to lookcarefully.andM;Given the automated nature of drive production, short of an obvious failure,a single drive should be a good sample, most experts say.andP;  But relying on asingle drive rather than on samples taken over an extended period fromvarious points in the distribution chain has its problems.andM;Some vendors, competitors say, will &quot;cherry pick&quot; a drive to send in forevaluation, while others will take a normal drive from production.andP;  Thatmight make a difference of as much as 5 percent to 10 percent in performance.andM;System makers who use a variety of suppliers may send in for testing a modelbuilt with the most-expensive components, but they may ship the lower-cost,high-volume products to most customers.andP;  Differences in performance can reachup to 30 percent, and differences in reliability by an order of magnitude.andM;Lastly, while there are differences among drives, different brands made bythe same company using identical components should be very close.andP;  Makers ofsuch dual-channel brands advise you to question carefully any test that showsvery different performance for what should be identical units.andP;  -- By SteveRosenthal</TEXT></DOC>
