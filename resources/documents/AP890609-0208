He usually chose large apartment complexeswhere he could easily remain anonymous.   ``Bob didn't talk much about his past,'' Wetmore said. ``Once,when I asked him, he said he was from Michigan.''   That was not a lie. John Emil List was born 63 years ago in BayCity, Mich., the son of a wealthy German immigrant grocer who hadmarried, for the second time, late in life.   Laura Werner, who rented an apartment from the family, remembersList as a sweet, little mama's boy.   ``He and his mother were very close,'' Werner said. ``She hadmarried in her 30s and John was her only child. He was the apple ofher eye.''   She said List, who spoke fluent German, attended a Lutheranelementary school and later went to public high school. He joinedthe Army in World War II and attended the University of Michiganupon being discharged.   List worked in Detroit and Kalamazoo, Mich., before rejoining theArmy in the Korean War. He was stationed at Fort Eustace, Va., whenhe met his wife, who had been previously married and had a daughter.   List later worked in Rochester, N.Y., and Jersey City, N.J.,before taking his family to Westfield in 1955.   Little of this past did List, as Clark, ever reveal.   Once, when Wetmore asked his friend if he had a family anywhere,it touched a nerve. ``He snapped at me, `No family!''' Wetmorerecalled. ``That was the only time I ever saw Bob show any anger.''   Gary Morrison, a former chef at the motel, remembered Clarksaying he had once been married but his wife had died of cancer.   In 1975, Clark joined St. Paul's Lutheran Church in downtownDenver.   The pastor, Rev. Bob West, said Clark became a pillar of thechurch during the 11 years he attended, even serving on the board.   ``I once asked Bob how he happened to choose us, and he said itwas because we were on the bus line,'' recalled West.   At a church singles party in 1977, Clark met Delores Miller, a40-year-old divorcee. By then, he owned a 1974 Volkswagen and hadgotten back into accounting, working for a company that madecardboard boxes.   Clark moved in with Miller in November 1985. They were married amonth later.   ``Delores never told me about Bob,'' said Wanda Flanery, Miller'sneighbor in Denver. ``I didn't meet him until he moved in.''   She said the newlyweds were a lot alike, both being quiet,reserved people who were devoted to their Lutheran faith.   In April 1986, Clark was laid off. His wife's salary as a clerkat the Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center was not enough to support thenewlyweds, and they began to slip in their monthly payments.   For 18 months, Clark kept house and always had dinner waiting forhis wife, Flanery recalled. In late 1987, Clark answered an ad froma Virginia employment agency that set up interviews with a Richmondaccounting firm.   Clark left Denver in February 1988 to take the new job, just asthe company was getting busy with tax season. Four months later, hiswife joined him in Midlothian, a suburb southwest of Richmond.   ``Delores had mixed emotions about leaving,'' recalled Flanery,who said they had been neighbors and friends for five years. ``Shesaid she really didn't want to leave Denver but Bob had been out ofwork since shortly after they were married and he had finally foundthis job in Virginia.''   Flanery received two letters from Delores Clark after she movedaway. Her friend referred to recurring financial problems and saidshe might have made a mistake leaving Denver.   To make ends meet, Clark had begun moonlighting for Handamp;R Block,and his wife started working one day a week in a hairdressing salon.   ``Delores called me on this past Mother's Day,'' Flanery said.``That was the last I heard from her before Bob was arrested.''   Clark was picked up 11 days after the ``Most Wanted'' broadcastdramatized the ballroom murders. The program, one that Clark watchedregularly and often recommended to neighbors, featured a plasterbust portraying List as he might look now.   ``I said, `That's Bob,''' Flanery recalled. ``I told myson-in-law to call the FBI and give them Bob and Delores' address inVirginia.''   After her husband's arrest, Delores Clark told the FBI shecouldn't believe he was a murderer. At a news conference Thursday,she described Clark as a good husband who had a deep and abidingfaith in God.   Clark had told her he had been married previously but that hiswife had died of cancer prior to his coming to Denver, she said. Hetold her he had no children.   Wanda Flanery says Clark's arrest shouldn't come as a completeshock to her friend.   ``A couple of years ago I bought a supermarket tabloid thatcontained an article on the List murder case,'' she said. ``Thearticle had a sketch of how List might look now and it was adeadringer for Bob.   ``I took the paper next door and showed it to Delores. She turnedpale and kept looking at it, saying, `Oh, my! Oh, my!'''   Flanery recalls asking Delores Clark if she thought her husbandactually was John List.   ``Finally, Delores shook her head and said, `That's not myhusband.' I then dared her to show it to Bob and ask him, but Idon't think she ever did. She's not a strong person and I don'tthink she felt she could have faced the truth so she just let itlie.''   Delores Clark acknowledged at her news conference that she haddismissed the magazine article from her mind and had never shown itto her husband.   Does Flanery have any regrets about her role in Clark's arrest?   ``I did what I thought was best,'' she said. ``For all I knewDelores was in danger. If he did it once, he could have done itagain, especially since they were having financial problems.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Strat Douthat is the AP Southeast regionalreporter, based in Atlanta.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
