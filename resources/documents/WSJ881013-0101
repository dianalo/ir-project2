Shell Petroleum, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said it bid $500 million for Tenneco's operations in Colombia and expects the transaction to be completed before year's end.    British Gas PLC said it bid $194.5 million for Tenneco's interests outside North America, excluding those in Norway and Colombia. British Gas said the interests contain estimated proven reserves equivalent to 47 million barrels of oil.    Star Gas Corp., jointly owned by Brooklyn Union Gas Co. and First Reserve Corp., said it agreed to buy Tenneco's propane gas operations. Terms weren't disclosed, but Brooklyn Union said the two propane companies annually sell about 60 million gallons of propane.    Also, the Conoco Inc. unit of Du Pont Co., which earlier disclosed its agreement to buy Tenneco's Norwegian oil and gas reserves in the North Sea for about $113 million, said it expects to complete the transaction by year's end.    Tenneco auctioned off its oil and gas assets for a total of about $7.3 billion. The net proceeds, which the company said will be about $6.4 billion, will be used primarily to reduce its huge debt. Tenneco, based in Houston, continues its operations in natural gas pipelines, shipbuilding, automotive parts, packaging, chemicals and farm equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
