Provocative research published today in the journalPediatrics suggests that they do.</LP><TEXT>   Though the finding brings to mind very small people inpinstripes and power diapers, the research may help parentsunderstand more about differences in temperament amongnewborns and how to provide for their own baby's needs.   In the study, believed to be the first of its kind,pregnant women who were rated Type A based on their highlevels of job involvement had babies who cried more onaverage and were more intense and less predictable, accordingto research by Dr. Steven Parker, director of the newbornnursery at Boston City Hospital, and David Barrett, a ClemsonUniversity psychologist.   The reasons, the researchers speculate, range from geneticto hormonal influences on the fetus in the intrauterineenvironment and, to a lesser extent, the different waysmothers handle their babies in the early days of life.   But Dr. Parker cautions that the differences intemperament can't be labeled good or bad. He says the babiesof Type A mothers weren't any more cranky or difficult thanother babies. He also says the conclusions are tentative andneed to be studied more.   &quot;I have this vision of a woman reading this study andshe's very Type A having her first baby, and she has afantasy of a cranky, irritable, Lee Iacocca coming out,&quot; hesays. &quot;But we're saying that they have a greater chance ofhaving a baby who's more intense, more full of beans, whoresponds to the environment more vigorously than a morelaid-back, mellow baby.&quot;   The study's findings are controversial and are raisingquestions from other researchers. Karen Matthews, a professorof psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who has studiedType A behavior in children, says her research hasn't found astrong link between &quot;familial contributions&quot; and suchbehavior. &quot;If you've got a Type A parent, it's notnecessarily the case that you've got a Type A child,&quot; shesays.   But some Type A women say the study's findings are arelief. &quot;This takes some of the weight off me,&quot; sighs L. KimSmith, who runs Metropolitan Mothers at Work Inc., aWashington, D.C.-area parent resource center. &quot;I'm up foranything that says it's not environmental,&quot; says the Type Amother of two Type A children.   She's sure she has passed on her highachieving,mega-active personality. &quot;We just spent nine million hourswriting a report on Jesse Jackson,&quot; she says, &quot;and mydaughter tearfully says to me, `Would you be real mad at meif I got an A-minus?' and you realize, `Oh, God, what have Idone?'&quot;   People with aggressive, impatient, hard-chargingpersonality traits were first identified by researchers inthe late 1950s as exhibiting a kind of behavior -- labeledType A -- that was linked to higher rates of heart disease.Some later studies have challenged the link to heart disease.Meanwhile, Type A people are often society's achievers,winning school and sports honors and going on to successfulcareers.   The research for the Pediatrics study focused on 73 middleand upper income women attending a health maintenanceorganization prenatal clinic in Cambridge, Mass., prior tothe birth of their first children. Virtually all of themworked during the pregnancy, and two-thirds were working onemonth before delivery.   They filled out the Jenkins Activity Survey, aquestionnaire that is widely used to measure Type-A behavior,along with questionnaires measuring their levels of anxietyand use of alcohol, tobacco and other substances.   More than half of the women who completed the study wereclassified Type A on the job-involvement scale, whichmeasures not just workplace commitment but involvement inmastering whatever task is before them. Fewer of the womenscored high on other scales, which measured traits of speedand impatience and hard-driving/competitiveness. That led theresearchers to speculate that Type A behavior in womenchanges as they adapt to pregnancy and motherhood.   A total of 60 babies were examined. Of these, 32 hadmothers who were classified as Type A. About 48 hours afterthe women delivered their babies, researchers who didn't knowthe mothers' type examined the babies' reflexes andresponses. The length of time the infants spent crying duringthe exam was recorded to measure how intensely theyresponded, along with the length of time it took them tosettle down when consoled.   Finally, when the babies were three months old, theirmothers filled out a questionnaire rating their infants'behavior and temperament.   The results, according to Dr. Parker: Women who were TypeA on the job-involvement scale had babies who on averagecried 40% more during the initial exam, though they were justas easy to soothe as other babies.   The babies were also rated by their mothers as reactingmore intensely to their environment and being moreunpredictable in their responses. But they didn't describethe babies as being any less adaptable than other babies.There was no correlation between the mothers' anxiety and theinfants' crying or other aspects of infant temperament.   The study also found that Type A mothers were more likelyto be breastfeeding their infants at three months. Theresearchers speculate that this is because they were moreinvolved with the &quot;job&quot; of breastfeeding. (Mothers who ratedType A on the speed and impatience scale, however, were lesslikely to be breastfeeding at three months.)   Dr. Parker cautions that the study only looks at a smallpart of the complex area of differences in newborntemperament. &quot;The same mother could have a completelydifferent child the next time,&quot; he says.   That's true of Mary C. Hickey, the author of thesoon-to-be-published &quot;Working Mother's Guilt Guide: WhateverYou're Doing It Isn't Enough&quot; and a self-described taker oftwo steps at a time. She says she has one Type A child andone Type B child. Her two-year-old daughter is &quot;the toddlerfrom hell,&quot; the type who &quot;sits on the potty unraveling thetoilet paper, and if you close your eyes for two secondsshe's in my makeup case drawing with the lipstick, and shecan open the baby-proof Tylenol caps and I've had toadminister Ipecac to make her throw up as a result.&quot; But herfive-year-old son &quot;is mellow and laid back.&quot;   On the other hand, Carin Pratt, the senior producer ofCBS's &quot;Face the Nation,&quot; who's currently on maternity leave,says she's &quot;about as Type A as you can get&quot; yet her two sonsare &quot;unbelievably laid back.&quot; She finds herself saying to heralmost three-year-old son &quot;Hurry up and do that&quot; when there'sno reason to hurry up. &quot;That's my failing,&quot; she says. &quot;Ishould learn to slow down.&quot;   Indeed, Dr. Parker says the study has practicalapplications for child-rearing. &quot;In the temperament field,people talk about the goodness of fit,&quot; he says. &quot;If you wanta baby who's full of beans and responds very intensely, thenit's real positive to have a baby like that.&quot; A more mellowbaby might not be such a good fit, but &quot;people need torespect that temperament and nurture that child and not tryto create a Type A child from a Type B child or vice versa.&quot;   &quot;I would think that it's the parents' job to see that itdidn't turn into negative patterns or patterns of failure oranxiety,&quot; says T. Berry Brazelton, a professor of childdevelopment at Harvard University.   ---           Testing for Type-A Personality Traits                                                                                                          To score yourself, circle your response to each questionand add up the numbers in brackets next to the response toget your total score.                                                                                                          -- 1.
