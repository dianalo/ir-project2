The company said it plans to press its appeal through a filing today with the Federal Communications Commission. &quot;It's time to let the market manage ATandamp;T,&quot; said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief operating officer. He said the FCC should &quot;redirect its resources to regulate the true monopolies in this industry -- the local telephone companies.&quot;    In the past two years, MCI and other long-distance companies have seen their earnings crushed by industry-wide price cuts prompted by the FCC's regulation of ATandamp;T. Until now, MCI had insisted that giving ATandamp;T more freedom to set its prices would be premature. As previously reported, the change of heart at MCI reflects a growing realization among its executives that more steep price cuts would be difficult to withstand.    At a news conference here, MCI's Mr. Roberts said he believes the deregulation of ATandamp;T &quot;will help MCI in terms of profitability and other things.&quot;    Wall Street's reaction to the new stance was muted but generally positive. MCI's stock price, which has been depressed for many months by a gloomy earnings outlook, rose 37.5 cents in national over-the-counter trading to close at $6.25 a share.    ATandamp;T called MCI's proposals &quot;right on target.&quot; For months, ATandamp;T executives have tried to persuade MCI officials to come around to ATandamp;T's point of view that MCI would be better off with a deregulated ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T today plans to file comments with the FCC outlining how it would like to be deregulated.    ATandamp;T officials wouldn't discuss the specific contents of the filing, but past interviews with executives indicate ATandamp;T will call for scrapping rate-of-return regulation in favor of some sort of price control. About 11 states have mostly scrapped rate-of-return regulation of ATandamp;T's intrastate operations and replaced it with regulation that allows it to adjust prices within a certain percentage without filing.    MCI's Mr. Roberts acknowledged that there is &quot;some risk&quot; in giving ATandamp;T wide latitude to set its own prices. But he said an even greater risk would be &quot;continuing the artificial market environment&quot; created by the FCC's current practices.    Mr. Roberts indicated MCI probably will support an approach being advocated by Dennis Patrick, an FCC commissioner who is expected to succeed Mark Fowler as chairman of the agency this spring. Mr. Patrick wants the FCC to consider a plan that will give ATandamp;T flexibility by setting a ceiling on the prices it can charge customers rather than dictating its profit margin on long-distance service.

Mr. Patrick wants the FCC to consider a plan that will give ATandamp;T flexibility by setting a ceiling on the prices it can charge customers rather than dictating its profit margin on long-distance service. A plan that includes such a ceiling would provide &quot;the necessary assurance&quot; that consumers wouldn't be harmed, MCI contended.    Lap Lee, an analyst for Wertheim, Schroder andamp; Co., called MCI's new posture &quot;the only viable option for this industry to move forward.&quot; But James McCabe, at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., cautioned that deregulation could take as long as two years to accomplish, even with FCC backing. He predicted that Congress would be reluctant to make such a change because of the likely impact on consumers. </TEXT></DOC>
