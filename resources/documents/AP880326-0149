The newspaper said the department _ five years and $12 billionafter President Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative(SDI) program _ has abandoned plans to try to protect U.S. citiesas well as its military centers from a Soviet attack.   The Post quoted senior U.S. officials as saying that thedecision to concentrate on a limited defensive system reflectsbroad agreement within the administration that the president'sdream cannot be attained.   The threat of a ballistic missile attack will not be diminishedin the foreseeable future, the officials told the Post, which didnot identify them.   The reorientation of Reagan's SDI program, also known as StarWars, was revealed in part by a 1987 Joint Chiefs of Staffclassified document calling for developments and deployment of adefensive system to stop only 30 percent of the nuclear warheads ina massive Soviet first strike, the Post said.   The four-page secret document accepted the view of SDI officialsthat even this limited defense would help deter a Soviet attack,the paper said. However, if this American view turns out to bewrong and the Soviets initiate a massive first strike, the systemthe Pentagon now envisions may stop only 1,500 nuclear warheads,allowing as many as 3,500 others to penetrate and wreak devestationon U.S. and allied territory, the Post said.   The newspaper said SDI officials believe this limited defensivesystem could be deployed beginning in 1996 at a cost of up to $150billion in current dollars, double the expense they predicted lastyear.   Many scientists and military experts, however, question whetherthe defensive weapons being pursued in the SDI program will be ableto achieve even the scaled-back goals, the paper said.   The Post cited U.S. officials as saying the Soviets may havesensed the course of internal American decision-making over SDI andpredicted that Reagan's dream would be abandoned, causing them totone down their public criticism of SDI in recent months andtolerate more aggressive SDI research under a potential new armspact.</TEXT></DOC>
