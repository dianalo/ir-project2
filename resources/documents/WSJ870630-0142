In it, Mr. Koranda decided a quote from the economist John Kenneth Galbraith was appropriate: &quot;In banking, tailoring substitutes for intelligence.&quot;    The executive thought that was a bit much for his audience of bankers, so he changed it to: &quot;In banking, conformity is often valued over initiative.&quot; Less colorful, perhaps, but certainly safer, it was another compromise in the often tortuous process of getting a corporate speech from draft to delivery.    Typically, that process involves battling layers of cautious bureaucrats intent on &quot;dulling up&quot; a speech. It means learning to cope with conflicting suggestions from various departments, and fending off subordinates who want to influence corporate policy. It means reasoning with engineers, scientists and technical specialists who love streams of numbers and jargon. And it requires getting through to busy -- and sometimes uncooperative -- executives.    Corporations have lately been snapping up speech writers, even while firing other public-relations employees. Many executives, concerned about fickle stockholders and customers, want to present their case with &quot;grace and style, wit and elegance,&quot; says Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, the chief executive officer of H.J. Heinz Co.    There's also a measure of ego involved. Executives realize the public has become more interested in corporate leaders like Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, whose success has convinced many others to try to raise their own visibility -- in part through more and better speeches.    Although no one has exact figures, most of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. employ people who either write speeches full-time or combine that duty with other types of public-relations writing, such as preparing financial reports. Some executives have their own writers; others are served by a stable of them. With salaries for top corporate speech writers ranging from $70,000 to more than $120,000, a growing number of companies are relying on free-lance help to cut costs, paying from $1,000 to $10,000 for a 30-minute speech.    However glamorous the job may sound, speech writers spend a lot of time drafting remarks for such occasions as plant openings, award ceremonies and charity functions -- often recycling the same themes. &quot;I can't tell you how many speeches I wrote about the importance of adopting a global outlook,&quot; says Rodger Morrow, a Pittsburgh writer who has worked for USX Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Corp.    But drafts of even minor speeches are routinely channeled through numerous bureaucratic levels, with unsurprising results. &quot;Everyone, to be seen as doing their job, had to do something to the speech,&quot; recalls Thomas S. Healey, who has written speeches for Exxon Corp. and Texaco Corp. &quot;'We can't say that; we don't want to imply this. Let's not get anyone angry at us.' You end up with vanilla pudding.&quot;    Mr. Koranda, now chief speech writer for the New York Power Authority, remembers stepping on sensitive toes last year in a speech for RCA Corp. about technology and values. In his draft, he wrote: &quot;Society, for example, countenances the automobile -- at a cost of 55,000 lives a year -- because it does the job better than the horse and buggy.&quot; He says an RCA executive ordered the car reference dropped because it might offend executives at Hertz Corp., which RCA then owned.    Don R. Alloway, a Bethesda, Md., speech writer who has worked for several corporations, says it was bureaucratic meddling that finally drove him to quit full-time writing one day in 1983.    Six days before the chief executive of a financial company was to deliver a speech, Mr. Alloway says he received copies of his draft from 24 executives -- &quot;with 24 sets of comments.&quot; And the chief executive hadn't yet even seen the draft. &quot;Twenty-four people rewrote it from their point of view,&quot; he recalls. A marketing manager, for instance, wanted the speech to tell the audience how certain financial products could be adapted to fit its specific needs. A lawyer wanted to talk about the legislative battle the company was prepared to wage. An economist wanted to focus on trends.    The final version was &quot;minestrone,&quot; Mr. Alloway says. But in such situations, he explains, &quot;you try to give every barking dog a little bone.&quot;    Sometimes speech writers get caught in the cross fire when managers try to influence policy. Robert Steck, a Washington, D.C., writer, recalls speeches he composed for James Lee, then chairman of Gulf Oil Corp., that supported deregulation of oil and natural-gas prices even though regulation probably benefited the company. The head of policy and analysis at Gulf would send memos suggesting he &quot;soften&quot; that support in the speeches, Mr. Steck says. &quot;The point is,&quot; he adds, &quot;he wouldn't dare go to the chairman and say, 'Hey, Jimmy Lee, you're all wet on natural gas.'&quot;    For nearly every corporate speech, writers say, editing battles are fought over managers' tendency to inject lots of numbers and technical jargon. Mr. Morrow, the Pittsburgh writer, says such conflicts often stem from what he calls a &quot;certain cognitive dissonance&quot; between the writers and many business people. &quot;They're more engineers, scientists, number crunchers, and we tend to be sort of liberal-arts, humanities types,&quot; says Mr. Morrow, who has an English degree from Yale.    In a speech a few years ago for a top Westinghouse executive, Mr. Morrow used a quote from Machiavelli, the Florentine writer on government. After reviewing the draft, he says, the executive &quot;wanted to know who this guy was.&quot; The executive was told, and decided to keep the quote, but he had trouble pronouncing the name. &quot;I thought he had it down,&quot; Mr. Morrow says, &quot;but when he got to the speech he hesitated and stumbled over it.&quot;    Of course, some executives are skilled at displaying their erudition in speeches, and it suits them. But many writers complain that they seldom get to tailor their work to an executive's personality or speaking style because they are denied access to him. That helps to explain why so many corporate speeches sound depressingly alike and tell the audience little about the speaker, the writers assert.    Mr. Morrow recalls working for one company chairman in the early 1980s. &quot;We used to have a rather curious little session that lasted no more than 10 minutes, no matter what the speech was,&quot; he says. &quot;You would walk into his office, and he might not acknowledge your presence for three to four minutes. It was like coming to visit the Wizard of Oz.&quot;    Accessibility and willingness to reveal a personal side are partly why speakers like Mr. Iacocca are so successful, writers say. Michael K. Morrison, Mr. Iaccoca's personal speech writer since 1984, says that in preparing a speech he first outlines suggested ideas and then meets with Mr. Iaccoca for feedback. &quot;I tape those conversations and I come back and, basically, type up what he said,&quot; Mr. Morrison notes, &quot;putting in the periods, commas and question marks, and it sounds just like him. Well, it's not quite that easy.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Iacocca has a reputation as a demanding editor. But at least he knows what he wants to convey. Some executives, claims Ervin S. Duggan, a Washington, D.C., free-lance writer, &quot;don't have a clue about what they should say. They may be great corporate strategists, but they don't live comfortably in the world of ideas.&quot;    At times, speech writers have to do some fancy footwork to support their bosses' shifting strategies. Mr. Koranda says that in his last speech at RCA, for former Chairman Thornton Bradshaw, he had to justify the pending merger with General Electric Co. as the most efficient way to fight foreign competition. Mr. Koranda says that was a &quot;complete departure&quot; from several previous speeches he had written for Mr. Bradshaw that stressed protectionism as the best answer.    There was a further irony in the speech, which warned of widespread layoffs if the merger failed to go through. After GE took over, it cut Mr. Koranda's position. &quot;The speech,&quot; he says, &quot;put me out of a job.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
