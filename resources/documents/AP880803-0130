The action abruptly stalled recent agreements on the divisiveissues and a period of general improvement in Vietnamese-U.S.relations.   The Voice of Vietnam radio said Vietnam's foreign minister anddeputy prime minister, Nguyen Co Thach, wrote a letter Sunday toretired Gen. John W. Vessey, President Reagan's special envoy onhumanitarian issues in Vietnam.   A text of the letter was carried by the official Vietnam NewsAgency, which was monitored in Bangkok.   Thach noted the recent agreements and said, ``regrettably, theU.S. side has not responded to the Vietnamese side's proposals forthe materialization of these.''   ``More regrettable still,'' Thach said, was Assistant Secretaryof State Gaston Sigur's July 28 testimony before a congressionalcommittee.   Sigur argued against establishing ``interest sections'' in Hanoiand Washington, saying that would not improve cooperation onhumanitarian issues, and instead urged continued U.S. isolation ofVietnam until it ends it decade-old military occupation of Cambodia.   ``Obviously, that statement shows that the U.S. State Departmentis continuing its hostile policy toward Vietnam,'' Thach wrote.``We have shown our seriousness and good will in solving the U.S.humanitarian issues, but in response ... the U.S. has made hostilestatements.   ``In face of that situation, I regret to inform you that theVietnamese side is forced to temporarily suspend the U.S.'sparticipation in the joint search for and excavation of Americansmissing in action as well as the resettlement in the United Statesof the released re-education camp people.''   Sigur, who is in charge of Asian affairs, testified before aHouse foreign affairs subcommittee in response to a pendingcongressional resolution that urges establishment of interestsections, or low-level diplomatic missions. Diplomats say Vietnamis desperate to break out of its international isolation and bringin much-needed economic aid.   Under the Thach-Vessey agreement of a year ago, Vietnam pledgedto accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans listing asmissing in action in the Vietnam War. The United States pledged tohelp Vietnam with its humanitarian problems.   In letters to Vessey last month, Thach pledged to try to resolveby the end of the year 70 MIA cases considered top priority by theUnited States and welcomed joint excavations for remains fromAugust to October. There have been no such excavations since thefirst one in late 1985.   Technical experts of the two sides met in Hanoi last week towork out arrangements. David Lambertson, assistant secretary ofstate for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said later: ``Weanticipate that joint activities ... could begin quite soon. Weanticipate a substantially higher level of activity over the nextthree months.''   Wednesday's broadcast did not say if Vietnam had also haltedunilateral efforts. It has returned large numbers of suspected MIAremains since the Vessey agreement.   In July, the two countries held talks in Hanoi on America'soffer to resettle former U.S. government employees and officials ofthe U.S.-backed South Vietnam government who were put into``re-education camps'' after the 1975 North Vietnamese victory.   A joint communique said Vietnam was allowing them to emigrate asthe United States gave assurances it would not encourage them toconduct anti-Vietnamese activities. It said they hoped thatprocessing could begin in a few months.   That was a minor breakthrough since there was virtually nomovement after the United States offered in 1984 to resettle theformer internees.   The Vietnam News Agency on Monday blamed the U.S. for lack ofprogress, saying the biggest obstacle was ``the U.S. side's refusalto set up a working group to organize the emigration to the UnitedStates of about 500,000 people, including relatives of the releasedinmates, and to oversee execution of this commitment.''</TEXT></DOC>
