The General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency, examined the impact of Trans World Airlines' acquisition of its major St. Louis competitor, Ozark Airlines, in 1986. The purchase increased TWA's share of passenger boardings at Lambert to 82% from 56%.    The GAO compared fares on 67 routes on which TWA, Ozark or both offered nonstop service in 1986 with the consolidated airline's fares in 1987. The agency found that fares were 13% to 18% higher in the first three quarters of 1987 from the year-earlier period. By contrast, air fares rose nationally, on average, 5% to 6%, according to the Consumer Price Index, GAO said.    The agency also found that while TWA increased the number of direct flights using Lambert after the merger, other carriers reduced direct flights. As a result, the number of cities receiving direct service from St. Louis fell to 121 in June 1987 from 124 in June 1986.    The report comes as many members of Congress are expressing unhappiness about the domination of some large hub airports, including those in Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, by single airlines. And it sets the stage for a Senate Commerce Committee hearing tomorrow, where panel members plan to question Transportation Secretary James Burnley and industry officials about the consolidation of the airline industry and its impact on the consumer.    TWA told the GAO that fares in St. Louis in 1986 were artificially low partly because of a fare-war with Ozark. In addition, TWA officials said, the airline was prompted to issue more discount fares at the time because a strike by flight attendants hurt service and publicity about a terrorist attack on a TWA jet reduced passenger traffic.    The airline told the agency that average fares rose in 1987 as business travel on the airline increased with the improvement of on-board service. TWA also said that it began offering first-class service on Ozark flights that previously had offered only coach service.    But the airline's explanation isn't likely to allay the concerns of Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) who requested the GAO report. He said the pace of fare increases at Lambert suggests that Congress should consider regulating fares at airports dominated by a single airline.    &quot;At a minimum,&quot; he said, &quot;Congress should consider steps to foster competition at concentrated airports, by removing obstacles to new carriers and boosting airport expansion to make room for new carriers.&quot;    Among other things, Sen. Danforth said Congress should consider prohibiting airport lease terms that allow dominant carriers to block the entry of competitors.    The GAO reported that under current market and regulatory conditions, it is unlikely that other airlines will be able to enter Lambert on a large enough scale to provide real competition to TWA.    Congress is unlikely to tackle the issue this year, but next year the consolidation of the airline industry may become a hot issue. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.), often has expressed frustration with airline deregulation. </TEXT></DOC>
