The very idea tends to challenge conventional thinking, becauseyou seldom hear about the little fellas but you can't escape hearingabout the big boys who make up the popular stock market averages.   The big brokerage houses research and promote big stocks. Mutualfunds and pension funds buy them. Business magazines interviewbig-company managers. Big- company products are advertised whereverpeople can see or hear.   But the records show one area in which the little guys beat thebig guys: The little guys, as a category, often can produce biggerreturns for investors than the big fellows. And they've been doingit for many years.   Several research projects demonstrate this, but probably thefirst of them was by Rolf Banz, a doctoral student at the Universityof Chicago in 1978, who examined all New York Stock Exchange stocksby size for every year in the period 1931-74.   He determined size by multiplying shares of each stock by shareprice. He ``invested'' equal dollars in each company in the bottom20 percent, ranked by market value. Each year he revised the list toinclude only the smallest.   Banz found that in that period his hypothetical portfolioproduced about a 5 percent better annual rate of return than themarket as a whole. Others later found a similiar effect, althoughnot always by the same percentages.   Five percent might not seem like much, especially at a time whensome folks aren't happy if they realize that kind of gain in amonth. But time is the forgotten factor of investing, and 5 percentover the years adds up beautifully.   Gerald Perritt, investment adviser, mathematician and author of abook on the small-firm effect, calculates that in the 60 years1926-85 the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index had a compound annualreturn rate of 9.8 percent, versus a 12.6 percent compound annualrate for the so-called small stocks.   He finds, therefore, that if an investor had been able to invest$1,000 in the Sandamp;P index at the end of 1926, that initial investmentwould have grown to $279,100 by the end of 1985.   But the smaller-stock portfolio would have grown to $1,241,200.   Now a mystery, albeit one with many clues: In the past five yearsor so the small-stock effect seems to have disappeared. Perritt, aformer professor who liked the effect so much he founded anewsletter to trace it, concedes it.   He doesn't concede much more, however. He is convinced it stillexists. He re-examines it from time to time in the newsletter,Investment Horizons, and recently he offered some reasons why smallhasn't outperformed big.   First, he says, individual investors have been liquidating theirdirect common stock holdings in recent years, while institutionalinvestors have been net accumulators. That helped push the bigshigher, relative to small.   Institutional investors generally concentrate their selections onthe large stocks _ they almost have to because of their appetite forbig blocks of shares _ while individuals traditionally have beenbuyers of small-company stocks.   Additionally, the stock market of the late 1980s was one oftakeovers and mergers, most of which were concentrated in largecompanies. And as most investors know, those takeovers pushed upprices spectacularly.   Perritt, based in Chicago, is biding his time, still convincedthat smaller stocks are the best bargains in the marketplace today.The long-term effect will again show up. He doesn't say when thatmight be.   ``Just because a store puts merchandise on sale is no guaranteethere will be a stampede of customers,'' he says. ``The samebehavior exists in the stock market.''   But, he concludes, ``when word of such bargains eventuallyspreads, demand begins to heighten as do the prices of themerchandise.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Monday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
