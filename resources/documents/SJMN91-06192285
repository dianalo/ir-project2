It can add elegance to aden and charm to a kitchen or dining room.;    Wainscoting kits usuallyinclude solid pine or cedar tongue-and-groove boards 32 inches long, about 31/2 inches wide and 1/516 inch thick.;    The boards interlock side by sideand are meant to be attached vertically. Where the boards meet, their edgesare either rounded and grooved to form a narrow bead or tapered to form a V.;   Both styles come with horizontal baseboard and chair-rail molding that isnotched on the back to cover the ends of the vertical boards. When assembledfrom some kits, the height of the wainscoting is 35 1/2 inches.;    Thecontents of a single kit will cover about five linear feet. Depending on thedealer, pine wainscoting costs about $18 to $25 and cedar about $25 to $40.;   Wainscoting can be attached directly to wallboard or plaster walls if thesurface is reasonably flat. Over masonry walls or bare studs, nail horizontalstrips of 1-by-3 lumber (called furring strips) at 16-inch intervals andaround the perimeter of the area to provide support and a suitable fasteningsurface.;    Before installing wainscoting, unpack it and let it adjust forabout 48 hours to temperature and humidity.;    On a finished wall, begininstallation by prying away the baseboard molding and discarding it.;    Next,cut the new baseboard molding to length. If wainscoting is to be installed onadjacent walls, cut all of the baseboard molding first, mitering or coping theends where they meet.;    For mitering -- cutting the ends of the molding at a45-degree angle -- use a miter box and back saw, or rent a power miter saw,also called a chop saw.;    Coping involves cutting the end of one piece so itfits over the front of another piece at a right angle.;    Miter the end ofthe piece to reveal the molding's profile, then saw the mitered part offsquarely, using a coping saw to follow the profile's contours. When finished,the coped piece should fit precisely against the other piece, whose end isleft square.;    Mark the height of the chair-rail molding on the wall, thencut these pieces to length and miter or cope them if necessary. Identify allpieces on the back so they can be reassembled exactly.;    Apply finish towainscoting before installing it; otherwise, unfinished portions may show ifthe vertical boards later shrink.;    If paint is to be used, sand with150-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit, and coat the wood with primer and onecoat of paint.;    After installation, apply a second coat. If a naturalfinish is planned, sand as described and coat the wood with penetratingsealer.;    Then apply stain if desired, followed by either a penetratingfinish (some of these contain stain) or a single coat of surface finish likepolyurethane. Coat the edges of boards as well as the side that will bevisible.;    When the finish is dry, nail the baseboard lightly into placewith annular-ring paneling nails about 1 1/2 inches long. Supplement thesewith construction adhesive if desired.;    Start applying the wainscoting atthe more difficult corner so that the last board will fit in easily. If theadjacent wall will receive wainscoting also, simply place the first board'stongued edge against the inside of the corner so that the grooved edge canreceive the next board, and so on.;    Hold a carpenter's level against thegrooved edge and adjust the board until it is vertical.;    If the walls arenot straight, causing the tongued edge of the board to slant more than aquarter of an inch away from the inside of the corner, set the arms of adrawing compass to the widest space between board and the corner.;    Then, byholding the pointed arm against the corner and sliding the compass up or down,scribe the surface of the board with the arm containing the pencil.;    Trimthe board with a saw or plane to the scribed line; the board should then fitperfectly against the corner.;    This process should also be performed if theadjacent wall is not to receive wainscoting; if the walls are straight, youneed merely remove the tongue of the board with a plane.;    Fasten the boardto the wall at 16-inch intervals with the same nails used for the molding andwith construction adhesive if desired.;    Install the remaining boards thesame way. Drive the nails at an angle to the wall for maximum holding power.When nailing into a V-groove, drive the nail into one side of the groove, notinto the center. Scribe and cut the grooved edge of the final board to fit byfollowing the instructions for the first board.;    After the vertical boardsare in place, fit the chair-rail molding over their tops and nail it to thewall, using adhesive also if desired.;    Then drive all nails below thesurface with a nail set, fill the depressions above the nail heads with putty,and either touch these up with penetrating finish or apply the final coat ofpaint or surface finish to the wainscoting as directed earlier.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN WARDE, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910710  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  997  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 10, 199100192285,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
