On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,fell 19 cents to close at $19.63 a barrel.   Contracts between February and June finished between 18 centsand 25 cents lower.   Analysts said the market's weakness did not reflect events inVienna, Austria, where the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries is holding its semi-annual conference.   OPEC ministers completed their third day of negotiations Mondaywithout reaching any conclusions on production limits, the issuedominating the talks.   ``We haven't heard any specific OPEC-related news and themarket's selloff didn't seem to be coordinated with news of theadjournment,'' said Larry Lawrence, manager of options andtechnical analysis for Elders Futures Inc.   Refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined.   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery lost 0.74 centto 50.89 cents a barrel, while contracts for delivery betweenJanuary and June ended 0.81 cent to 1.10 cents a gallon lower.   No. 2 heating oil for December delivery slipped 0.49 cent to60.92 cents a gallon, January lost 0.44 cent to 60.43 cents andFebruary declined 0.43 cent to 58.75 cents a gallon.   Analysts said the sparse volume was due partly to the OPECmeeting.   ``People are waiting to hear,'' said Greg Dreis, energy brokerwith Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Once we see a decision out ofOPEC we'll see more activity.''   OPEC ministers are trying to decide whether to devise a new planfor allotting production shares according to each nation's abilityto pump oil or simply to continue the current quota system.</TEXT></DOC>
