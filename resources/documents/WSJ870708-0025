The rally came despite a large volume of new corporate debt issues as well as several big new municipal offerings. But trading volume was light, and several traders said they were surprised that the dollar's surge and a slight drop in U.S. crude oil prices didn't provide the credit markets with an even bigger lift.    The Treasury's latest 30-year bonds wound up the day with gains of about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, the same as on Monday. Corporate bonds also rose slightly, while actively traded municipal bonds rose about half a point to three-quarters of a point.    Early in the day, activity was especially slow, partly reflecting nervousness about what Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North would say at the Iran-Contra hearing.    &quot;We had the TV sets going here, and I instructed my traders to be a little careful, to trade a bit defensively until we got the drift of North's testimony,&quot; said Alfred G. Roth, a managing director at Chemical Bank and head of U.S. government securities trading. &quot;You never know what the man is going to say. So that kept a lot of people on the sidelines.&quot;    Although the hearings didn't produce any significant disclosures and the dollar held its gains, bond trading activity remained lackluster. Several traders said Col. North provided part of the explanation for the bond rally. But others weren't so sure.    &quot;If there was any impact from North, it wasn't detectable to me,&quot; said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. Mr. Roth said traders were &quot;very relieved&quot; that Col. North didn't blurt out any shocking disclosures, but he said trading activity all day was &quot;very light and very sporadic.&quot; He added: &quot;I am surprised they (long-term Treasury bonds) didn't do even better, given the performance of the dollar.&quot;    Moreover, the federal funds rate edged lower yesterday, adding to speculation that the Federal Reserve System may be easing its credit hold ever so slightly. But many economists insist that the Fed hasn't changed its credit grip at all. They argue that the funds rate decline probably is caused merely by temporary technical factors in the banking system.    According to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc., the funds rate yesterday averaged 6.67%, down slightly from 6.73% Monday. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, is watched closely as a barometer of Fed policy.    Traders are especially focusing on the Federal Reserve this week because the central bank's policy-making committee met yesterday and will meet again today to review credit strategy. The Fed committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, also will review the central bank's money supply targets. A Fed spokesman, as usual, declined to divulge what was discussed.    The Fed will disclose its money targets and economic estimates to Congress later this month. A date hasn't been set, the Fed spokesman said. Nor has it been decided who will testify. In the past, Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has represented the Fed. But President Reagan early last month nominated Alan Greenspan to succeed Mr. Volcker, whose term as chairman expires next month.    Since Mr. Volcker is a lame duck, some analysts predict that the Federal Open Market Committee won't make any significant changes in credit policy. Furthermore, they say, the Fed doesn't have any reason to change policy just yet.    &quot;There has been some speculation the Fed is easing or about to ease&quot; credit conditions, said Mr. Stone of Merrill Lynch. &quot;The fed funds rate is softer, and that's reinforcing that speculation. But I suspect they won't pull the trigger right now.&quot;    The Fed committee meets about eight times a year. It consists of the seven members of the Reserve Board plus five of the 12 presidents of Fed district banks. Since there is one vacancy on the Reserve Board, caused by Henry Wallich's resignation last December, the FOMC currently has only 11 members.    The Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to a price of 103 31/32 from 103 20/32 Monday. The yield declined to 8.38% from 8.42%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rose to 101 21/32 from 101 12/32 as the yield declined to 8.25% from 8.29%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 4.14 points to 1311.41. The high for the day was 1312.41, while the low was 1303.70.    During the past seven weeks, Treasury bond prices have advanced more than seven points, or over $70 for each $1,000 face amount. The latest 30-year issue's yield has fallen two-thirds of a percentage point from 9.09% in mid-May.    The decline in bond yields to their lowest levels since April helped prompt more than $1 billion of new debt offerings yesterday by corporations. Some of these issues, including $250 million of 33-year bonds by Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., are to refinance more expensive debt. Yesterday's corporate and mortgage-backed offerings included:    --A $300 million package of 10-year and 30-year bonds by Texas Utilities Electric Co. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. priced the 9 1/2% bonds, due July 1997, at 99.375 to yield 9.598%, or about 1.33 percentage points more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The 10 1/2% bonds, due July 2017, were priced at 99.125 to yield 10.596%, or 2.2 percentage points more than the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017. The first mortgage and collateral trust bonds are rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-B-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $300 million issue of Remic collaterized mortgage obligations through a trust formed by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.

The bonds were priced to yield between 1.15 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points more than similar-maturing U.S. Treasurys. The bonds are rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P.    --A $250 million issue of Pacific Gas andamp; Electric first and refunding mortgage bonds due August 2020. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the 10% bonds at par, a yield of 1.58 percentage points more than the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017.

Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the 8 1/8% notes at 99.725 to yield 8.23%, or 0.6 percentage point more than the Treasury's three-year note.

Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the 8 3/4% notes at 99.70 to yield 8.808%, or 0.69 percentage point more than the Treasury's seven-year note.

The notes are rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal bond market, activity was brisk in the new-issue arena. Here are some of yesterday's largest new offerings:    --$120 million of bonds by the Fulton County, Ga., School District. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the issue after an auction to yield from 5.25% on bonds due 1990 to about 7.69% on bonds due 2017. The securities are rated double-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P.    --$90.8 million of general obligation school bonds by the Washoe County, Nev., School District. The bonds were priced after auction to yield from 4.5% in 1988 to 7.85% in 2007, according to underwriters led by First Boston Corp. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    --$60 million of general obligation improvement bonds by Montgomery County, Md. The underwriters were led by Citicorp Investment Bank. The securities, rated triple-A by both Moody's and Sandamp;P, were priced after auction to yield from 4.10% in 1988 to 7.375% in 2006 and 2007.
