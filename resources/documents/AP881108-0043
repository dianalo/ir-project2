Bruce Phillips, representing a company hired by the city to getrid of the waste, said Monday he received a document last weeksaying the ash has been disposed of, but not where or when.   Phillips, who represents Joseph Paolino andamp; Sons Inc., said thedocument was sent as a fax from Romo Shipping Corp., which hebelieves is the ship's owner, to Amalgamated Shipping Co., thevessel's former owner.   The ship underwent repairs in Yugoslavia in August. It isbelieved the ownership of the Khian Sea changed hands and that theship was renamed the Felicia, said Jim Vallette, a spokesman for theenvironmental group Greenpeace.   Vallette said the international organization believes the ash,estimated at 10,000 to nearly 15,000 tons, was dumped in thevicinity of the Indian Ocean.   Vallette said the ship unsuccessfully attempted to dispose of theash in Sri Lanka in mid-October.   ``Over the past three weeks, we've sent notices to every countrybordering the Indian Ocean warning them of the cargo'' the ship iscarrying, he said.   Vallette said Phillips received the copy of the documentThursday, indicating the ash was dumped before then.   Phillips would not say when or how he received the copy.   He said he is preparing a motion arguing that Romo, Amalgamatedand others are in civil contempt for defying an injunction filedJune 2. Phillips said the injunction prohibits dumping or disposingthe ash without notifying his client of a plan in advance.   ``It's aggravating because it is already a fait accompli,'' thelawyer said of the disposal.   Joseph Paolino andamp; Sons cannot receive payment from the city unlessit can show the ash has been disposed of in ``an environmentallysound manner,'' Phillips said.   The ship began its journey Sept. 5, 1986, with 15,000 tons ofincinerated Philadelphia trash, and has traveled to Central America,South America and the Mideast in search of a place to dispose of it.   The ship unloaded about 3,000 tons of the cargo in Haiti beforeleaving under government orders last February. Haiti ordered thecargo returned to the ship before it left, but an undeterminedamount was left behind.   Efforts to dispose of the ash in the Bahamas, the DominicanRepublic, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape VerdeIslands also proved unsuccessful.   Vallette said Greenpeace could not determine where Romo islocated, although he said it is believed to be a Middle Easterncompany, possibly Egyptian.   Although Greenpeace has labeled the ship's cargo toxic, the statefound no problems with the ash when it was originally loaded. Testsby the state Department of Environmental Resources and the federalEnvironmental Protection Agency while the ship waited fruitlessly inthe Delaware Bay to return to Philadelphia also found it to be safe.   The ship's journey recalls the five-month odyssey last year of agarbage barge carrying 3,100 tons of trash from Islip, N.Y. Thebarge was spurned by Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Mexico,Belize and the Bahamas before returning to New York and dumping thetrash in Brooklyn.</TEXT></DOC>
