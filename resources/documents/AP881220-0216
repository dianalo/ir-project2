Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph also said Monday theinvestment firm couldn't accept the terms presented to it, sourcesfamiliar with the remarks said. The sources, who spoke on conditionthey not be identified, said the tone of the statement suggested anindictment had become more likely.   Joseph made his remarks over a public-address system, and theywere broadcast to Drexel branches nationwide.   The sources paraphrased Joseph as saying, ``Not at this pointdoes a settlement make sense.''   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has been the subjectof an intense investigation for more than two years stemming fromits involvement with Ivan F. Boesky, the one-time speculator nowserving a 3-year prison term for the biggest insider trading fraudin U.S. history.   Drexel repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing but has beennegotiating with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office over the pasttwo months in an effort to avoid an indictment for racketeering andsecurities fraud.   The government reportedly has demanded that Drexel plead guiltyto multiple felony counts and pay a fine as high as $750 million. Inaddition, the government has requested Drexel's assistance inimplicating other possible wrongdoers, both within and outside thefirm.   Steven Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, declined comment onJoseph's reported remarks to employees. Deborah Corley, spokeswomanfor Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, also declinedcomment.   There has been heightened speculation in the past few weeks thatDrexel would reach a plea-bargain settlement with the governmentbefore Christmas. Federal prosecutors have intensified the pressureby exacting cooperation from at least three traders in Drexel's WestCoast high-yield bond department.   Drexel's problems began after Boesky paid a $100 million fine tothe Securities and Exchange Commission in November 1986 and agreedto plead guilty to a felony charge as part of his plea-bargain.Three months ago, the SEC filed a wide-ranging civil lawsuit againstDrexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and three otherkey employees, accusing them of conspiring with Boesky to violate arange of securities laws.   Drexel was a pioneer in the $175 billion high-yield bond market.It is one of the most profitable Wall Street firms and has around10,000 employees worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
