<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0684 </DOCNO><TEXT>An apparatus is described which is well suited for angle-resolved electronspectrometry of free atoms and molecules using monochromatised synchrotronradiation. Two variations are presented, one for room temperature gaseousspecies, the other for metallic vapours. The analyser is of the cylindricalmirror type, designed, however, so as to accept with one sector the entiresource volume independently of the photon beam diameter. It can be equippedwith a positon-sensitive detector instead of a channeltron, which extendsits potentiality. The system consists of up to three cylindrical mirrorsector analysers (CMAs) where a double-sector CMA can be rotated aroundthe photon beam direction, allowing angular distribution measurements,and another sector CMA is mounted in a fixed position providing a signalfor reference purposes. A detailed description and experimental testsare given for the performance of the CMA, i.e. its imaging properties,resolution and transmissions, as well as for possible instrumental asymmetriesaffecting angle-resolved experiments.</TEXT></DOC>
