The sale Tuesday was a sullen, but not necessarily sober,occasion for some 200 former patrons, many of whom brought theirown beer to have a few final drinks at the Texas-style eatery andwatering hole.   Much of the bidding was subdued. A set of steer horns fetched$30 and 22 parquet tables sold for just $9 each.   Not surprisingly, a 41-foot, 3,000-pound iguana that adorned theGreenwich Village restaurant's roof brought the highest price.Stewart and Lynne Anne Fisher of Glen Cove, on Long Island, bid$17,500 for the polyurethane lizard.   ``I bought it for my wife. It's one of a kind. It's a piece ofNew York history and I'm a little crazy,'' explained an elatedFisher.   Minutes later, Mrs. Fisher was up on the roof hugging theiguana. She insisted she had bought it for her husband, areal-estate developer. Both agreed it would adorn their horse farmnear Charlottesville, Va.   The iguana's sculptor, Bob Wade of Dallas and Santa Fe, hadhoped his friends would bid on it. But they had stepped out to buysome beer and when they returned the iguana was sold.   Everything was sold except for four cans of nacho cheese sauce.The kitchen sink sold for $50.</TEXT><DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md.
