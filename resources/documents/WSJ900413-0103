The Diablo Canyon facility, nearly 20 years in the making,became a fixation at PGandamp;E, preoccupying the company'smanagement and its board. &quot;We were totally absorbed,&quot;confesses Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief executive.&quot;We were worn out.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In a striking about face, the nation's largestinvestor-owned utility has shed its woes lately, turnedpotential financial disaster into a profit, and is tryinghard to rework its tarnished image.   Thanks to an unconventional pact with state regulators-inwhich the company's revenue from Diablo Canyon depends on theplant's performance rather than a fixed return on investment-- PGandamp;E last year coaxed $225 million in after-tax profitfrom its one-time white elephant and may make more this yearif the plant continues its current output.   Moreover, the San Francisco-based utility is enjoyingconsiderable public good will from its quick restoration ofservices after the city's Oct. 17 earthquake. The companyexpects to recoup nearly all of its estimated $100 million inearthquake-related outlays from insurance and from rates.   With regulatory treatment of Diablo Canyon settled, &quot;wefeel liberated,&quot; says Mr. Clarke. Now PGandamp;E is wooing the sameenvironmentalists who once hectored it. It's also striving tooperate Diablo Canyon efficiently and safely, and broadeninvestments in non-regulated businesses with which it says itfeels familiar.   A number of utilities have enjoyed a similar burst of cashflow, as heavy borrowing for nuclear construction suddenlyhas reversed and become a stream of revenue when a plantcomes on line. The sudden wealth has been badly spent in somecases. Pinnacle West Capital Corp., for instance, squanderedanticipated profits from its Palo Verde nuclear station byinvesting in the thrift business, nearly bankrupting itselfin the process.   PGandamp;E is determined to avoid such pitfalls, says Mr.Clarke. &quot;We're not diversifying; we're taking advantage ofthe business that we know,&quot; he asserts.   Mr. Clarke says the company expects first-quarter netincome to be lower than the year-earlier 53 cents a share. Ascheduled refueling outage of the Unit 2 reactor at thecompany's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant makes it &quot;reasonable toassume that our earnings will be lower than they were lastyear,&quot; he said.   But the executive said 1990 net income likely will exceedthe $1.90 a share reported for 1989. However, he said anaverage of analysts' estimates of $2.07 a share is &quot;a littlehigh.&quot;   PGandamp;E had net income of $244.4 million, or 53 cents ashare, in the 1989 first quarter on revenue of $2.11 billion.Net income last year totaled $900.6 million, or $1.90 ashare, on $8.59 billion in revenue.   To expand its non-regulated business, Mr. Clarke said PGandamp;Emay substantially boost its investment in natural-gasexploration and production. The company's PGandamp;E Resources Co.subsidiary presently holds interests in exploration leasescovering about 600,000 gross acres in Texas, Louisiana,Arkansas, California, and the Rocky Mountain region. Theholdings amount to about 220,000 acres, net of otherinvestors' interests.   &quot;It's not infeasible that in resources you might see ahuge acquisition of reserves,&quot; Mr. Clarke added.   PGandamp;E, late in 1988, acquired Wessely Energy Co.'s U.S. oiland gas assets for about $100 million. At the time, it saidfurther acquisitions were planned. However, purchases haven'tmaterialized yet. Mr. Clarke said the company is constantlyreviewing possibilities.   In another gas-related venture, PGandamp;E is opening refillingstations for vehicles powered by compressed natural gas. Thecompany expects to have nine such stations open to the publicby the end of the year.   PGandamp;E also plans to about double the capacity of a pipelinethat carries natural gas from western Canada to the Pacificnorthwest and California, adding 900 million cubic feet dailyof new transmission capacity. Operation of the $1.5 billionproject is scheduled for 1993. Its capacity is alreadycontracted for, Mr. Clarke says.   Jointly, the three natural gas projects are part of anoverall strategy. &quot;Our whole premise is that . . . gas is agood business to be in,&quot; Mr. Clarke says.   PGandamp;E's environmental thrust is focused on future powerdevelopments, where the company is working at least as hardon the generating capacity it won't build as that which itwill. Of about 3,300 megawatts of forecast potential newdemand over the next decade, PGandamp;E thinks it can forestall atleast 2,500 megawatts -- roughly equal to the output of twonuclear generating units -- through energy conservation.   The utility plans to spend about $170 million this yearand about $200 million annually after that on financialinducements to reduce demand among a wide range ofelectricity consumers. Plans include educational efforts forenergy-efficient lighting, inducements for industry to usemore efficient motors, and better residential insulationprograms.   The California Public Utility Commission currently isconsidering proposals under which PGandamp;E would receive a returnon these investments.   Mr. Clarke said about 800 megawatts of capacity notachieved through customer efficiencies may be provided inpart by wind and solar power. A substantial portion, however,likely will be come from updating existing gas and oil-firedgenerating stations, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
