A few hands goup. &quot;I'm not surprised. I was rationed then. Is there acombatant who saw me in the '60s?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Not a hand rises this time.   &quot;Ah, the most frightened generation. Won't admit toanything. Believe me, you are free to laugh.&quot; A hand finallywaves in an upper tier. &quot;There's one] Thanks to you, you whocame to see me, I survived until today -- without subsidies,without a telephone] You'll never get rid of me now]&quot;   The audience breaks into applause.   It has been 16 years since Jan Pietrzak's troupe lastplayed Chelm, during a brief lapse of Communist vigilance. Inthose days, he was lucky to get the show out of a privateapartment and into a basement coffeehouse. No wonder he needsmoral support from his fans today. Poland gave communism theboot a year ago, but the spectacle of a political revue inthe Chelm amphitheater on a hot Saturday afternoon still istoo bizarre for Mr. Pietrzak to believe.   Poland's famously censored satirist looks out at a crowdof small-town Poles -- 2,500 of them -- who have come intheir finery, with bags of strawberries and scads of kids,for two hours of songs, skits and stand-up comedy. Behindhim, across the backdrop, the Communists have left a mementoof their deadpan reign. &quot;Motherland is Our Cause,&quot; reads aslogan in giant red letters. As Mr. Pietrzak's joke goes, itdoesn't specify which motherland.   &quot;After so many years -- in Chelm again,&quot; he exults,striding on stage, past the piano and drums, for his openingmonologue. &quot;The last time I came to Chelm it was in thePolish Peoples' Republic. This time it's in the Republic ofPoland. The people have been in power for so long, they'vedisappeared]&quot;   In blazer and tie, with gray hair and trimmed moustache,Mr. Pietrzak, at 53, looks a lot less somber than his oldfall guy, the general in dark glasses, but not nearly sochipper as his hero, the union leader from Gdansk. Ifpoliticians have it tough in Poland's new republic, politicalcomedians have it tougher. With the Communists out, Mr.Pietrzak has lost his shtick.   Just getting to see his act used to be an achievement.Today, a state entertainment agency produces it. And thepeople of Chelm may be hicks, but they're no fools. Theyexpect new material.   The Poles had an analogy for communism's phony freedom:Democracy is to socialist democracy as a chair is to anelectric chair. Now, Mr. Pietrzak has an update for lastyear's dissidents: It's easy to sit down, but a lot harder toget up.   The old system was a comic's playground, a gag that hadalready been running a decade when Mr. Pietrzak began workingthe student clubs in 1957. He didn't exactly opt forpolitical satire. In the ubiquitous state he couldn't avoidit. As he likes to say, &quot;You'd sing a song about parsley, andthey'd think it was about them.&quot;   Unamused, the Communists kicked him out of the clubs inthe mid-1960s and confined him to a coffee shop that seatedonly 50. In the mid-1970s, they banned him altogether. Hepassed the hat on the apartment circuit until Solidaritybloomed in 1980 and he became its jester. He got ontelevision, entertained the strikers with classic one-liners:&quot;In the Sahara, socialism would run out of sand.&quot; And hewrote Solidarity's anthem, &quot;Let Poland Be Poland.&quot; AnAmerican TV special picked it up; Ronald Reagan wrote a niceletter.   Martial law landed him back underground, then into thecoffee shops again, with a table booked for the censors atevery show.   But now what? The revolution has taken away the fun oftelling anti-Communist jokes that Communists don't get.   Somehow, as he lays into old enemies at the amphitheaterin Chelm, Mr. Pietrzak's lines seem shaded by rancor andpity. When he sings &quot;Let Poland Be Poland,&quot; it sounds moresentimental than defiant. Beside the stage, his undergroundtapes and videos are on sale, repackaged as his &quot;archives.&quot;Is Jan Pietrzak's cabaret in danger of becoming a nostalgiaact?   Not if his first post-Communist troupe can help it. &quot;Iwelcome all generations,&quot; Mr. Pietrzak announces, bringing onstage a young comic, Marek Majewski, who lets the audience inon the cabaret's troubles with a song that goes: &quot;You have tohit them] Ridicule them] Flog them]&quot;   &quot;Right,&quot; Mr. Pietrzak interrupts. &quot;It's easy to say. Butwho do you hit?&quot;   &quot;It used to be simple,&quot; sings Mr. Majewski. &quot;It wasobvious who made it hard on us. But now it's not them whohave the power. It's -- &quot;   &quot;Us]&quot; Mr. Pietrzak shouts.   That calls for an adjustment. In a democracy, politicalsatire can't just flog the losers. Accustomed to siding withthe good guys, Mr. Pietrzak has to force himself to pick upthe whip.   Solidarity does have its easy marks. Even Lech Walesahimself commands an uncommon talent for triple-talk. As Mr.Pietrzak cracks, &quot;One day Lech thinks the government is good.The next day he thinks the government is bad. And on thethird day, he denounces what he said on the previous twodays.&quot;   The audience breaks up, but this approaches hallowedground. A few things are still sacred in Poland. MikhailGorbachev, for one, is too dangerously lame to be an objectof fun. The Poles have another raw nerve right now, but isthere a comedian in the world who can swear off jokes aboutthe cost of living?   Every comic on Mr. Pietrzak's card takes a potshot atPoland's crash into capitalism.   Marek Majewski: &quot;Soon Poland will be a country of richpeople, because the poor will die of hunger.&quot;   Krzysztof Jaroszynski: &quot;I saw some people walk out of agrocery with their mouths wide open, like fish in anaquarium. This is what I call price shock.&quot;   Pawel Dluzewski: &quot;They say everybody should set up abusiness. A lot of people believe it -- so they open shops,they open post offices. They do it at night. They aren'tafraid of risk]&quot;   &quot;So many funny things,&quot; Mr. Pietrzak tells the audience.&quot;The price of tickets -- isn't that funny?&quot; At $1.50 apiece,the people of Chelm aren't laughing. &quot;I'm very amused. Twotickets for half a liter of vodka. That's what I'm reducedto. Such an artist]&quot;   His circumstances, kidding aside, are even slimmer. Mr.Pietrzak has never dwelled on money; he's been pleased toperform. A master at talking his way out of police stations,he is less able at negotiating a contract. For this day'swork, he and his cast will share a fee of $300. The state,producer of the show, still gets the last laugh.   After the finale -- a rousing song that boosts cabaret asthe one true guide to Polish politics -- Mr. Pietrzak canhardly bear to let his paying customers go.   &quot;Was it worth it?&quot; he calls after them as they depart.&quot;Will you come next time? It's important]&quot; They applaud inthe affirmative, and he tosses out his closing line, yetunchanged for the new Poland: &quot;See you in better times]&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
