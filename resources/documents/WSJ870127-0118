And if they do, why do they keep changing their minds?    Not so long ago, as you may well remember, the dollar was a pretty valuable thing to have anywhere in the world. If you were abroad it was welcomed everywhere. Innkeepers and shopkeepers were eager for it, and in many places natives would sidle up to you offering to give you lots of francs or whatever for your little green pieces of paper.    If you were a stay-at-home, you found your dollars so useful you could buy foreign goods cheaply. Not just those big-ticket items like home computers or autos from Germany and Japan but also French wines or English biscuits.    Then those powers-that-be, like our secretary of the treasury, decided that the dollar price was too &quot;high.&quot; They said the high price for the dollar in the world's eyes was the root cause of our large balance-of-trade deficit, which they thought was a bad thing and needed to be corrected.    So they got together with their foreign counterparts in one of those international confabs and decided to correct that &quot;wrong&quot; price for the dollar. A cheaper dollar, they said, would enable exporters to sell more abroad because it would take fewer deutsche marks, for example, to pay the dollar price for American goods. It would also discourage foreigners from selling so much here, because we would need to spend more of our cheaper dollars to buy that Toyota, BMW or even a Yugo.    That would put an end to our trade deficit. It would also ease the debt burden on foreigners; the less they had to pay for dollars the easier they could pay their dollar debts.    I must say those powers-that-be succeeded in knocking down that &quot;high&quot; price for dollars. Go abroad today and you'll often find the natives scoff at your greenbacks. It takes more of them now to pay for your lodging, your food or any souvenirs to bring home.    If you aren't a traveler it also takes more of the cheaper dollars to buy a Honda, a Volkswagen, Taiwanese textiles or other foreign goods. It all adds to your cost of living.    Thus the efforts to cheapen the dollar were successful. But -- surprise! -- cheapening the dollar hasn't ended our balance-of-trade deficit or done much to help American exporters export more. Turns out there were some other reasons why American cars, for instance, don't sell too well in Europe. Maybe our manufacturers have just lost their once-competitive edge.    But not to worry. I see by the papers there's talk in Washington that the trouble is the experts haven't yet got the dollar down to the &quot;right&quot; price and they're talking of knocking it down a little more until they hit it. Then all will be well.    If I have a little skepticism it's because I've lived too long. I even go back to the time when the dollar was based on gold until President Roosevelt made owning gold illegal. I remember too when, even earlier, FDR and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. would sit down every morning and decide the relative price of dollars and gold (still the standard elsewhere in the world) by flipping a coin.    I also remember the days under the Bretton Woods system after World War II when gold was at least the medium of exchange among central banks. That worked fine until the system began to chafe too much under this discipline. Then President Nixon had to &quot;close our gold window.&quot;    With that, a dollar became just a piece of paper. So did pounds sterling, francs and the other currencies. That was supposed to mean that the value of one currency against another would be settled in the open marketplace where world currencies traded. It was in that open marketplace that the dollar rose until it was thought &quot;too high&quot; by those who professed to know what was the &quot;right&quot; price.    It was at that point that the powers-that-be decided to intervene in the currency marketplace. Central banks stepped in to sell dollars and buy other currencies, and since central banks have billions of those pieces of paper to play around with they could affect relative prices more than the ordinary people -- you and I and commercial traders. They could move the dollar down and other currencies upward in price, according to their whims, or judgments of what the relationship &quot;ought&quot; to be.    Which leaves us where we are, which for me is pretty much confused. If you're planning a trip abroad or contemplating buying a Toyota next year, you can't know even approximately what it will cost you in those once good old American dollars.    Of course, we could again peg the dollar and other currencies to gold, which would make them relatively stable, but only a few old reactionary curmudgeons propose such a thing. That would be too confining. Each country would be forced to manage its economic affairs by the straitjacket imposed by a metal whose supply doesn't vary very much.    That would be good for you and me, since we could have a pretty good idea today what our dollar would be worth tomorrow in world markets. A dollar saved today would likely be worth as much next year.    And that's where the problem lies. Governments then wouldn't be able to play around with the balance of trade or balance of payments to suit their own purposes. How could our government help our exporters or stop us from buying abroad what that steady dollar permitted us to buy?    So my guess is that those powers-that-be, no matter what they say, are going to keep tinkering with our dollar on the foreign-exchange markets while they search for the dollar's &quot;right&quot; price. Your dollar tomorrow won't be the same as the dollar in your pocket today.    But what I don't understand is how they're going to know when they've found that &quot;right&quot; price for the dollar. To me, it's a puzzlement.    ---   Mr. Royster is editor emeritus of the Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
