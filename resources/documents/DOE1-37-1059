According to surveyresults, one out of every four North Carolina households (27%) currentlyuses a wood stove to supply at least some of the heat for their homes.This represents 16%, or approximately 330,000 households, using woodas their main heating fuel. Survey results show that in households wherethe wood stove was the main source of heat, 72% were freestanding stovesand 28% were fireplace inserts. Most wood stoves were installed by thehomeowner or a friend on a do-it-yourself basis (72%), and 28% were professionallyinstalled. An information booklet is needed to address this growing marketsegment. This project is designed to achieve the following: (1) producea document that provides an information source for the residential woodfuel user that will help inform them of the systems available, who makesthem, how to operate and install them efficiently and safely, and howto maintain them; and (2) conduct a systematic survey regarding the facilitiesand experience of existing users and to systematically collect, automate,and publish information regarding wood fuel users. This information willbe extremely valuable to potential users of wood fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
