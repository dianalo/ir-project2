<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1223 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theoretical model expressing the gas-matrix heat transfer is developed.It takes into account the exchanges by conduction, convection and radiation,the solar radiation penetration into the matrix cells and the variationswith temperature of the gas and solid physical properties. Also, thismodel considers the possible presence of a quartz window. Experimentalresults related to silicon carbide and mullite honeycomb receivers aredescribed. Then, theoretical and experimental results (temperature profiles,solar radiation penetration into the matrix) are compared. Also, heatbalances over the receiver are presented and its thermal efficiency iscalculated.</TEXT></DOC>
