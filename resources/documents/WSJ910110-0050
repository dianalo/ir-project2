There is Charles Keating, the Sandamp;L kingpin, showering fivesenators with campaign dollars. There are the senators,ham-handedly pressuring regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating.Capitol Hill staffers run amok in the background. The captionreads piously: &quot;Constituent Service.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Each stroke is drawn with excess to caricature whatCongress has become. Yet lawmakers are haunted by seeing bitsof themselves in the picture.   &quot;If that is improper, I think all of us at one time oranother have done that,&quot; says Sen. Daniel Inouye, a HawaiiDemocrat. Sen. Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat and achief target in the case, says more than 20 colleagues tellhim privately, &quot;There but for the grace of God go I.&quot;   As televised to the nation, the Keating Five affair is astory of senators going to unusual and possibly unethicallengths in behalf of a money man. But cast in another light,the case is a primer of something much broader. It capturesthe essence of today's Congress -- a lawmaking institutionthat often resembles a service institution built on politicalmoney.   Congress has succumbed to what Charles Heatherly, ascholar at Washington's Heritage Foundation, dubs&quot;clientitis.&quot; Republican Sen. Bob Packwood, for example, iswell known as an accomplished legislator. But the Oregonsenator also spends time working on behalf of a permitrequest for a television station at home, or helping Pacificfishing interests fight a bid by the North Carolinadelegation to have the Food and Drug Administration permitmarketing of the steelhead trout as the &quot;salmon trout.&quot;   Oklahoma lawmakers, on behalf of rural hospitals, devotehours to modifying new clinical-laboratory rules drafted bythe Health Care Financing Administration. Real-estatedevelopers line up tax writers to change an Internal RevenueService provision related to drainage and curb improvements.   &quot;It's not just the Keating Five; it's the Keating 535,&quot;says Ellen Miller, director of the Center for ResponsivePolitics in Washington.   Logrolling and special-interest money aren't new here. Thelegendary Daniel Webster was on retainer to banker NicholasBiddle, for instance. What has changed is the growth infederal regulatory agencies, especially since the New Deal ofthe 1930s. A second wave, under the Great Society programsand continuing into the Carter years, was matched by growthin an &quot;influence industry&quot; in which hired guns, mostlylawyers, guide well-heeled constituents through theregulatory maze.   The Constitution provides fertile ground. The ExecutiveBranch writes the all-important rules that make specific thelaws that Congress passes -- but Congress holds the pursethat keeps executive agencies funded. Thus, when a lawmakertalks, a regulator listens.   &quot;As federal programs have grown, particularly on theregulatory side, there are opportunities to intervene,&quot; saysThomas Mann of the Brookings Institution.   Meanwhile, the decline of political parties and politicalmachines spurs lawmakers to look for chances to prove theirworth as individual power brokers. The large post-Watergateclass of 1974 in the House is the most striking example.Though swept into office on the wings of reform, theseDemocrats have often proved the most adept at tapping vestedinterests to ensure their own survival in what had beenRepublican districts.   As domestic appropriations declined under Ronald Reagan,it became harder to bring home the bacon. The new currencybecame constituent services -- everything from helping widowsget government benefits to arranging tax breaks and specialwaivers for big business.   &quot;Congressmen have been seeking ways of ingratiatingthemselves with constituents,&quot; says Prof. John Johannes ofMarquette University. &quot;They have literally hustledconstituents and have tried to get more and more requests forhelp.&quot;   But when does helping become fixing? How big a role shouldmoney play? &quot;There's a line,&quot; says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, aKansas Republican. &quot;It's sometimes a fine line. But I reallydo think we know not to cross it.&quot;   In the Keating case, each senator offers a morality talewarning where Congress risks losing its way: Sen. AlanCranston, the California Democrat, is a train off the trackin relentless pursuit of campaign contributions. Sen.DeConcini is a cautionary tale for those whose requests forfair treatment turn into a demand for a special deal. BankingChairman Don Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, symbolizes a largercommittee system in which members vie for position andspoils.   Sens. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and John Glenn,the Ohio Democrat, emerge as lesser characters butnonetheless as lessons-in-life for their colleagues. Sen.McCain's vacations and trips in the fast lane with Mr.Keating illustrate lawmakers' penchant for accepting favorsfrom people with a stake in legislation; Sen. Glenn's formerstaff members, the glaring conflicts of interests that suchassistants can create.   Robert Bennett, the special counsel to the Senate EthicsCommittee, has called the case a &quot;booming warning&quot; of theneed to reform. The emphasis on constituent services and thepressure of rising campaign costs are on a collision course,he warns. &quot;The reputation of this body and its members willbe in ruins.&quot;                                                                                                          Alan Cranston: The Magnetism of Money                                                                                                          It was a scene from a B movie. In the final days of the1986 campaign, a Keating aide flew to Los Angeles with thedocuments for a $300,000 line of credit hastily arranged forSen. Cranston. On the tarmac at LAX, Mr. Keating's emissarymet the senator, rode downtown in a limousine, got thedocuments signed and then returned to the airport.   In addition to the campaign loan, which was held inreserve but never used, Sen. Cranston received $850,000 fromMr. Keating and his associates, a sum accounting for morethan half the $1.3 million funneled to the five senators. Atone point, minutes after receiving $250,000 from Mr.Keating's American Continental Corp., Sen. Cranston spoke tothe thrift executive to thank him and then did his bidding bycalling the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board toarrange a meeting on behalf of Mr. Keating.   Rarely is the link between money and deed so blatant onCapitol Hill. Yet in a Congress where some office Rolodexesand index cards are color-coded to show who gave and whodidn't, contributions make some constituents more equal thanothers. Sen. Cranston, one of the Keating Five, put itbluntly to the Senate Ethics Committee: &quot;A person who makes acontribution has a better chance to get access than someonewho does not.&quot;   Long dubbed the mother's milk of politics, money now seemsmore like cocaine. While the average American family earns$35,000 a year, the average senator must raise $35,000 every20 days throughout his or her term to meet the $4 millionminimum cost of a competitive campaign. Outside the Capitolone evening, Sen. Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican whoserves on the very ethics panel hearing the Keating case,doesn't miss a beat as he jokes with Larry Speakes, apublic-relations consultant and former White House spokesman.&quot;Come by and see me,&quot; the senator yells good-naturedly. &quot;Andsend me a contribution.&quot;   &quot;The issue is: Does money follow votes or do votes followmoney?&quot; says a Democratic lobbyist for business interests.&quot;It is a dance of death the way it is going. Someone takes asnapshot, and you're either enticing them or being seduced.&quot;   Members hunt for what they politely call &quot;financialsynergy&quot; between beliefs and constituencies -- and money.Timothy Wirth, who arrived here in the post-Watergate era ofreform, found his with the cable industry as a member of theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee. Now in the Senate, theColorado Democrat delayed consideration of a cable-regulationbill a few months after the industry held a major fund-raiseron his behalf last year. A spokesman for Sen. Wirth says theindustry's fund raising had no effect on his objections tothe bill, which the industry opposed and which died in thelast Congress.   Though the dollars are fewer, the same lesson is evidentin the case of Rep. Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who hasestablished himself in the House leadership andAppropriations Committee. In 1989, Mr. Fazio attachedlanguage to a spending bill at the behest of Western growersand canners seeking to block a ban on a widely usedfood-color additive shown to cause cancer in animals.Meanwhile, four political action committees funded by thesame canning or fruit-growing interests tripled theirdonations, from $1,750 in the 1988 election cycle to $6,250in 1990. A Fazio spokeswoman says the congressman goes to batfor these groups because they are constituents, not becauseof contributions.   Seeking to improve his own image with business back home,Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, moved to build ties withthe insurance industry by going to bat for home-statecompanies on tax provisions last fall. In 1984, when he wonhis Senate seat, Sen. Harkin received only $5,500 from 10insurance-industry PACs, according to Federal ElectionCommission records. In 1990, he received $27,754 from thesame 10 committees and more than matched his rival, Rep. TomTauke, who had strong support from such heavyweights as AetnaLife andamp; Casualty and the National Organization of LifeUnderwriters.                                                                                                          Dennis DeConcini: The Urge to Intercede                                                                                                          Few on Capitol Hill take &quot;constituent service&quot; moreseriously than Arizona's Sen. DeConcini. When Sen. McCainbecame a senator, he dispatched staffers to Sen. DeConcini'soffice to study how he handled constituent requests. RobertMaynes, a DeConcini aide, describes his boss's attitudetoward anyone impeding his constituent services as &quot;kick buttand take no prisoners.&quot;   That was the case in April 1987, when Sen. DeConcinisummoned Edwin Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, to his office for an after-hours meeting with foursenators to discuss Mr. Keating's problems with Mr. Gray'sagency. To heighten the pressure, Mr. Gray was told to comealone -- a request, he now says, that made him uneasy. Thesenators also came without staff.   &quot;In my experience, I've never been contacted by four orfive senators on behalf of a single institution,&quot; saysWilliam Seidman, now the nation's top thrift regulator, in adeposition in the Keating case. &quot;Staff were always present.&quot;   It is an extreme case of the highhandedness currentlycharacterizing some of the dealings between Congress and theExecutive Branch. But it is far from the only case. Sen.Packwood lambasted Carol Hallett, who heads the CustomsService, in his office to protest a ruling raising importduties on athletic shoes made by Oregon-based Nike. (Sen.Packwood did not, however, bar staff members or receive largecontributions from Nike.)   Sen. Paul Simon's office asked a student-loan-guaranteeofficial to stretch out the repayment schedule of a culinaryschool whose owner had raised $7,300 for the IllinoisDemocrat's 1990 campaign. Sen. Simon also drew criticism forcalling a bank official on behalf of a campaign contributorwho had had a loan dispute with a failed thrift institution.In the first case, Sen. Simon turned over the $7,300 incontributions to the Treasury; in the latter, he says, heproperly helped settle a dispute concerning a constituent.   At least one senator, though, judged Mr. Keating soarrogant that he refused for years to even see him. &quot;He wasjust so pushy and aggressive,&quot; says Jake Garn, a UtahRepublican on the Banking Committee, recalling meetings withMr. Keating in the early 1980s. &quot;The first thing he did wastell my appointment secretary how many houses he was buildingin Utah.&quot;   House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell-- like Sen. Riegle, from Michigan -- also said no. &quot;Keatingwas in to see me,&quot; says the chairman, recalling a late-1986meeting. &quot;We told him we were not going to help.&quot;                                                                                                          Donald Riegle: The Chairman's Power                                                                                                          Sen. Riegle, however, had a different view of Mr. Keating.Mr. Keating wasn't a &quot;constituent,&quot; strictly speaking;although he had investments in Michigan, he lived in Arizonaand did most of his business in California. But today'sCongress has an expanded view of constituency that includescompanies or industries governed by committees on whichmembers serve. And no one is better able to serve suchconstituents than committee chairmen.   According to letters and testimony in the Senate ethicshearings, Mr. Keating courted Sen. Riegle because he was nextin line to become chairman of the banking panel. (He assumedthe post in January 1989.) The Sandamp;L executive mentioned Sen.Riegle's impending chairmanship prominently in a 1987fund-raising letter he distributed on the Michigan Democrat'sbehalf. Sen. Riegle also had clout with Mr. Gray by virtue ofhis seniority on the Banking Committee.   Sen. Riegle concedes that taking contributions fromfinancial-services PACs creates &quot;the appearance&quot; of aconflict of interest because of his leadership of thecommittee regulating the industry. Last summer, he said thathe was returning $120,000 in PAC contributions he hadreceived from the thrift industry and that he would no longeraccept such gifts. In 1988, he had earlier returned the$78,000 that Mr. Keating raised for him.   But other lawmakers continue to use the clout of achairmanship or other senior positions in Congress as amagnet for contributions. As chairman of the Senate CommerceCommittee, Sen. Ernest Hollings, for example, has been in aposition to stall legislation that would revamp tort damageawards -- a bill opposed by the mammoth trial lawyers' lobby.The South Carolina Democrat reaps hefty contributions fromtrial lawyers around the country. A spokesman for the senatordenies any connection between his boss's stand and the money.   At the time of his 1984 Senate campaign, Montana DemocratMax Baucus ranked fifth in what was then the minority on theSenate Finance Committee. Today, he heads the internationaltrade subcommittee and ranks third in the pecking order. HisPAC contributions have grown as well, from $666,796 in1983-84 to more than $1.37 million in the 1989-90 electioncycle.   The emphasis on PACs is even heavier in the House, wheresubcommittee chairmen and ranking Republicans can find enoughspecial-interest money without ever asking real voters athome to chip in.   Until pushed out by the GOP leadership late last year,Rep. James Quillen was the ranking GOP member on the HouseRules Committee, which is a final clearinghouse forlegislation and for what amendments are permitted. Going intothe last weeks of the 1990 elections, his campaign treasuryheld more than $1 million in unspent cash, swollen by$414,703 in contributions over 21 months. This included$326,800 from PACs representing such groups as the triallawyers, National Rifle Association and federal retirees, allwith a major stake in legislation in the last Congress.   Rep. Quillen says his &quot;outstanding contributions&quot; comebecause of his outstanding record, not because of any of hisleadership positions.                                                                                                          John Glenn: The Unchecked Clout of Staff                                                                                                          Mr. Keating thoroughly understood the tremendous influencewielded by congressional staffers. His entire lobbyingstrategy hinged on massaging his ties with senators' staffersto gain entree to their bosses.   Today's increasingly specialized Congress has anever-expanding roster of committees and subcommittees. Theyoung lawyers and political workers staffing the panels havebecome powerful players in Washington, able to insertlanguage into bills and handle constituent cases on theirown.   James Grogan, a lobbyist in his early 30s who hadpreviously worked on Sen. Glenn's staff, was the conduit formany of Mr. Keating's contacts and contributions on CapitolHill. Two other Glenn aides -- Leonard Bickwit and WilliamWhite -- followed Mr. Grogan through the revolving door, andtheir law firms were retained by Mr. Keating for lobbying andlegal help in Washington.   Working in tandem with Mr. Grogan, Mr. White helpedarrange the $200,000 &quot;soft-money&quot; contribution from Mr.Keating to a political action committee affiliated with theOhio Democrat. In a fawning letter to Mr. Grogan, Mr. White-- a Washington lawyer who lobbied for the Keating-controlledLincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association while also heading Sen.Glenn's PAC -- proudly noted that Mr. Keating's contribution&quot;will be the largest individual amount ever provided in thehistory of John Glenn's public service.&quot;   Two of Sen. DeConcini's top political aides, Ron Ober andEarl Katz, were also privately beholden to Mr. Keating. TheirArizona home-building business had received millions ofdollars in mostly unsecured loans from Lincoln. In adeposition, Mr. Ober, who headed the senator's 1988 campaign,says he didn't inform Sen. DeConcini about his borrowingrelationship with Lincoln until the end of 1988.   Mr. Katz, meanwhile, not only was Sen. DeConcini's chieffund-raiser but also helped collect $11,000 inKeating-related contributions for Sen. Riegle.   Carolyn Jordan, Sen. Cranston's top banking aide,testified at the Keating hearings that she often calledfederal regulators on Lincoln's behalf and insertedstatements by her boss into the Congressional Record withouteven checking with him.   And no staffer wielded more power than Sen. Riegle's topBanking Committee aide, Kevin Gottlieb. Mr. Gottlieb wastreated almost like a senator, raking in thousands of dollarsin honoraria, the special-interest speaking fees that helpraise lawmakers' income. He not only handled banking mattersfor Sen. Riegle but also immersed himself in the MichiganDemocrat's campaign fund raising. It was through Mr. Gottliebthat Mr. Keating and his underlings arranged fund-raisers onbehalf of the banking chairman.   And after staff members leave Capitol Hill, their prestigeis usually enhanced by their access to old colleagues.Washington law and lobbying firms vie for their services andpay many of them well into six figures. When Arnold andamp; Porterhired the former chief counsel of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee in 1988, for example, the Washington law firm threwa lavish reception in his honor in a Senate caucus room. Notonly did some powerful senators, including Chairman Sam Nunnand senior Republican Strom Thurmond, drop by, but so did allthe major defense contractors in town -- just the clientsthat the firm hoped to attract with its new catch.   Similarly, Ralph Everett, a former top staffer at theCommerce Committee, was courted eagerly when he left his jobin late 1989. Shortly after he began his new job, theWashington law firm that Mr. Everett joined won a lucrativelobbying retainer to represent a coalition of telephonecompanies. The companies fall under the jurisdiction of Mr.Everett's old stomping ground, the Commerce Committee.                                                                                                          John McCain: The Power of Perks                                                                                                          Until their relationship ended abruptly in 1987, Sen.McCain's family, including an &quot;au pair&quot;, vacationed eachAugust at Mr. Keating's palatial home in Cat Cay in theBahamas. The senator and his wife also occasionally used Mr.Keating's corporate plane as a personal taxi service. TheArizona Republican only belatedly repaid Mr. Keating for some$13,000 worth of travel.   Though accepting annual vacations from a singlecontributor may be unusual, lawmakers routinely take suchgratuities from special interests.   The House voted to ban honoraria in return for a raiselast Congress, but senators can still augment their salariesby more than $23,000 annually with outside speaking fees.Over the past five years, Sen. Riegle has taken in more than$90,000 by making the same basic speech over and over againto the Washington Campus, an organization that teachesbusinessmen about the ways of Washington.   And although House members denied themselves honoraria,they are still permitted to accept transportation and lodgingfor trips lasting less than six days. In 1987, Lynn Martin,who was then a House member and recently was nominated to beLabor Secretary, financed most of her honeymoon with trips toFlorida and Jamaica that were paid by outside groups.   Because such trips must be disclosed only annually, mostescape public attention. However, sometimes senators do go tothe wrong place at the wrong time. Sen. Wyche Fowler, aGeorgia Democrat, traveled to Iraq last spring on a tripsponsored by the National Association of Arab Americans andpaid for by the Union of Arab Historians. He was caught inthe country at the same time an Iranian-born Britishjournalist accused of spying was executed. Sen. Fowler gotsome unwanted publicity because of the unfortunate timing.</TEXT></DOC>
