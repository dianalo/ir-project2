The restructuring is intended to reduce debt and boost the company's capital. Like many Southwestern banks, Banks of Mid-America has been hurt by the energy and real estate slump and has been posting losses.    The company said it is offering about 60.5 million new common shares at $1.24 a share to current shareholders and other investors. Some directors and other insiders have agreed to buy up to $26.7 million of the offering.    In addition, Banks of Mid-America is offering to exchange each $40 face amount of its 10 3/4% notes for $28 in cash, 26 common shares or a combination of cash and stock. The offer is contingent on 90% of the notes outstanding being exchanged.    Both the stock offering and the exchange offer expire Oct. 11.    The company said a special shareholders meeting will be held Oct. 4 to vote on several aspects of the restructuring, including a plan to convert its preferred shares to common.    After the restructuring, Banks of Mid-America will have primary capital of about 11.3% of assets, compared with about 7.7% of assets currently.    Banks of Mid-America's stock closed at 87.5 cents, down 12.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
