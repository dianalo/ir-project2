A theoretical investigation of the effect of this system ona rail gun has shown that two benefits occur. Projectile velocities andlaunch efficiencies increase significantly depending on the magneticcoupling between the rail and augmentation circuits. Previous work evaluatedan idealized system by neglecting energy dissipation effects. In thispaper, the authors extend the analysis to include the neglected termsand show improved actual launch efficiencies for the SARG configuration.In this paper, the authors discuss details of projectile design in depthand present preliminary results of rail gun performance.</TEXT></DOC>
