Meanwhile over in the Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body voted 92 to 5 to ban sales in the U.S. by Toshiba and Norway's state-owned Kongsberg-Vaapenfabrikk for at least two years.    The two companies undoubtedly are guilty of a gross security breach, deceitfully selling crucial propeller technology to the Soviet Union in violation of agreed rules. But we somehow doubt that jumping around on the grass with sledgehammers is the most constructive response. For that matter, trade sanctions aggravate allies and hurt U.S. consumers. What we need is some kind of response that bolsters Western security, not weakens it further.    Last July a Soviet submarine unexpectedly popped up around the continental shelf in the Atlantic. It had evaded the U.S. underwater listening devices that previously had picked up Soviet submarines from as far as 200 miles away, allowing us to track them leaving port on the Kola Pennisula and through the sea lanes between Norway, Iceland and Greenland and into the Atlantic.    Pentagon planners realized that something important had happened, and soon learned that in 1983 and 1984, the two companies had shipped to the Leningrad shipyards computerized milling machinery capable of producing super-contoured propellers. With these new props, Soviet submarines can move almost noiselessly underwater, and the new class of Soviet attack aircraft carriers now being built can achieve faster speeds and better maneuverability. The new propellers cut the acoustic-detection distance from 200 miles to about 10 miles. This leads to calculations that recouping the anti-submarine capability may cost as much as $40 billion, while the sale gained the companies only $23 million.    The enormity of this has become widely recognized. Yesterday Toshiba's chairman and president resigned in disgrace, and Japan has indicted the executives directly responsible, though they'll be tried for violating currency laws. Norway has been less forthcoming, blaming everything on one British expatriate working for Kongsberg. Both Japan and Norway have pledged to assist the U.S. in the effort to rebuild its anti-submarine capabilities. Rather than using this as an excuse for further trade-bashing, the U.S. ought to be using it to pressure the two countries into further efforts toward the common defense.    The Japanese Constitution renounces the right to use military force. This has come to mean that Japan spends only 1% of its gross national product on &quot;self-defense.&quot; Certainly the Japanese could do much more to assist the U.S. in the defense of the Pacific without frightening its neighbors. Japan also could approve a long-stalled espionage law to reduce Soviet access to Western secrets via Japan.    Norway, a NATO member, has thrown up a host of impediments to its own defense. It doesn't allow any foreign troops or nuclear weapons to be stationed on its soil in peacetime. For that matter it keeps allied military exercises 500 miles by road away from its Arctic border with the Soviet Union and recently refused the U.S. permission to use F-111s in a joint exercise for fear of provoking the Kremlin. Ending these restrictions would do a lot more for the common defense than banning Norwegian products.    In Congress's current mood, just about anything becomes an excuse for choking trade in one way or another. But what the Toshiba-Kongsberg case proves is not the need for less trade, but the need for more seriousness about defense. </TEXT></DOC>
