 The LHX's existence anywhere but on thedrawing board is unconfirmed, but if Electronic Arts' simulation is evenremotely accurate, this is one super flying machine.andM;LHX Attack Chopper's excellent pilot's manual gives you a thorough primer inthe fine--and often fatal--art of helicopter warfare.andP;  It explains basiccharacteristics of helodynamics--torque, rotational compensation,nap-of-the-earth flying, and other stuff you'll be too busy to worry about ifyou want to avoid a variety of bad guys without slamming your machine intothe ground.andM;That said, it's comforting that the LHX does some of the flying for you; youneedn't worry about real-world concerns like controlling the speed of thetail-fan.andP;  But staying airborne is far from a cakewalk.andP;  Because you flyclose to the ground to avoid detection, you're constantly at the whim offriendly little air currents that cause abrupt changes in altitude, sometimeswith unfortunate results.andM;You may use a mouse, your keyboard, ora joystickto steer your helicopterthrough three simulated battle areas: Libya, East Germany, or Southeast Asia.andO;In any of these areas you can choose from about ten different mission types,in which you'll fire laser-guided machine cannons, Hellfire anti-tankmissiles, and AIM-9L Sidewinder or Stinger air-to-air missiles at Soviet-madearmaments.andP;  These range from relatively benign BTR-70 troop carriers todeadly Kamov Ka-34 Hokum attack helicopters and MiG-27 Flogger jet attackaircraft.andM;LHX gives you five levels of difficulty from which to choose.andP;  Level One iseasiest, and Level Five is about as close to unsurvivable as it gets: enemiessee you long before you see them and unless you're an expert pilot you'll beclimbing out of your own personal smoking crater every time.andP;  This isn't toimply that LHX is impossible to play; on the contrary, after about 15 hoursin the cockpit I found Level Three relatively easy, and Level Four ajust-winnable challenge.andM;The LHX's cockpit is user-configurable to give you as much or as littleinformation on its three CRT screens as you want.andP;  Should one screen crackwhen you're hit, you can reconfigure the other two.andP;  If you lose all yourscreens you your heads-up-display (HUD), you can use satellite views toattempt to make it home in one piece.andM;If you manage to land your crippled chopper in enemy territory, you may belucky enough to garotte your guard, escape from your POW camp, and fly again.andO;And if you're hit in the cockpit you may struggle to return your aircraft tobase, but die of complications from your wounds.andP;  In any case, LHX informsyou at the end of each mission how much damage your craft incurred, and howmuch of the taxpayers' money it will take to repair it.andM;Should you not wish to fly the world's most advanced rotor-driven aircraft,Electronic Arts has tossed in three other flying machines, including thevenerable McDonnell Douglas AH-64A Apache attack helicopter (excellent whenfacing ground-based armor) and--for rescue missions, transport missions, andsupply drops--the Sikorsky UH-60A Black Hawk.andM;Or, if you're truly adventurous, you might try the Bell/Boeing V-22 Osprey, ahighly experimental, vertical takeoff and landing, tilt-rotor plane.andP;  Butfrankly, after flying the LHX, these other aircraft seemed downrightclunky--like driving station wagons after airing out an Indy Car.andM;LHX supports the ADLIB card for realistic high-volume helicoptersound--though you'll be perfectly satisfied with what comes out of your PC'slittle speaker.andP;  Explosions sound like explosions, and machine-gunfire soundslike machine-gunfire.andP;  When your ship takes an incoming shot from a rifle orsomething larger, each shot produces a slightly sickening thud that lets youknow you're that much closer to walking home.andM;The orthogonal graphics are a little simple even in 256-color MCGA mode, butthat's forgivable considering the pace and complexity of the animated action.andO;Electronic Arts doesn't skimp on LHX's user-controlled views--nearly a dozenperspectives in all.andP;  You can watch from behind your 'copter, from anairborne spotter craft or one on the ground, from the warhead you've justfired, from behind your target, or from the target itself.andP;  A satellite viewgives you a rough approximation of your location should total instrumentfailure occur.andM;One vast improvement over Electronic Arts' previous military simulations isthe amount of diversity LHX offers.andP;  In Abrams Battle Tank, for example, youknow where the enemies are once you play through all of the missions, sosuccess becomes more an element of memorization than of skill.andP;  In LHX, eachmission is different--to a degree.andP;  Not only does the terrain vary somewhatfrom location to location, but there are three or four different scenariosfor each mission.andP;  One Medevac mission may be entirely different from thenext, and positions and types of enemies change from mission to mission.andM;To the diversity of missions add five playing levels, four aircraft fromwhich to choose, and more than two-dozen enemies--several of them airborne(and therefore highly unpredictable), and most of them quite deadly.andP;  Givenall that, it will take you some time to become bored with LHX Attack Chopper.andO;In fact, it may take you several tries just to survive an entire mission.andM;LHX Attack Chopper exemplifies the current generation of highly detailed,extremely challenging military simulations.andP;  It should appeal to militaryhardware fans and hardcore gamers alike.andM;List Price: LHX Attack Chopper, $59.95.andP;  Requires: 512K RAM; CGA, EGA, MCGA256-color; DOS 2.10 or later.andP;  Copy protected through documentation.andO;Electronic Arts, P.O.
