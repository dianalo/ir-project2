As it coaxed the genie of labor unrest back into the bottle over the weekend, the government produced a draft law intended to keep the stopper on tight. The bill, which the Parliament will take up Wednesday, would arm the central authorities with special powers to enforce their market-oriented program of decentralization.    These would include the power to suspend the right to strike, hard won by the independent trade union, Solidarity, in the early 1980s. They would also allow a wage-price freeze to fight inflation and an acceleration of bankruptcy proceedings against state companies judged to be money-losers beyond hope.    One of those companies happens to be the Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk, a stronghold of the now-illegal Solidarity union, where about 1,000 strikers were still holding out last night for a negotiated settlement. To some Polish officials, bankrupting the shipyards would be a sterling example of economic reform in action.    &quot;If it weren't such a big enterprise and called after such a big name it would have collapsed long ago,&quot; said Jerzy Malkowski, the government spokesman on reform.    Having used force to break a strike at the Nowa Huta steel mill last Thursday, the government has put on kid gloves in Gdansk, where another big name, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, remained among the strikers. Management at the shipyards discussed wages Saturday and yesterday with the unofficial strike committee. It was a concession the strikers happily called a sign of their legitimacy.    The strikers made no progress on their basic demand for the legalization of a Solidarity local, and by late evening the authorities were demanding that the strikers leave the shipyards or face prosecution. Whatever the outcome of this confrontation, the government is now turning to the task of keeping more strikes from breaking out again soon.    The government banks on the belief that most Poles won't strike if they know it is against the law. Because the strikes of the past two weeks weren't called by a legal union, they were illegal. But some workers may not have realized that, the government figures. &quot;It would be different,&quot; Mr. Malkowski said, &quot;if an announcement were made that strikes would be illegal for the next few months.&quot;    The trouble is that many government loyalists, let alone opponents, find the idea of a strike ban a giant step backward.    A former member of the Communist Party's central committee, Jozef Pajestka, said he would be &quot;astonished by a suspension of the right to strike. The government would lose everything.&quot; The official trade unions, which have never called a strike, denounced the proposal as a &quot;severe blow.&quot; The unions' head, Alfred Miodowicz, belongs to the party's politburo.    While the draft law may yet be watered down, however, it clearly has the backing of the dominant interests in this system that favor public order over economic reform: the bureaucrats, the party apparatus, the security forces, and the military.    &quot;The rulers of Poland are theoretically in favor of reform and against repression,&quot; said Jerzy Holzer, who has published a history of Solidarity in the underground press. &quot;When times are quiet, they can be fairly liberal. But confronted with strong opposition, they abandon the policy immediately, paralyzed by their own power base.&quot;    Still, the state insists that public order and tough controls are the only tools it has left to save Poland's reform. Strikes, as Mr. Malkowski put it, don't mean much in a country without a free market for labor; it will mean much more if the government can hold down inflation.    Inflation got Poland into its current mess. The government imposed price increases early this year in the hope of enacting a socialist law of supply and demand. Then it succumbed to wage claims that more than matched the price increases. Inflation hit 45% in the first quarter, scuttling reform. Workers who weren't satisfied walked off the job. In two cases, Solidarity got involved and the crisis turned political.    Even if calm returns, economists in and out of the opposition doubt Poland can simply conquer inflation through a strike ban and a wage-price freeze without addressing the issue underlying Poland's years of malaise: the people's mood.    &quot;Already, they are tired of this reform,&quot; said Janusz Beksiak, an economist and Solidarity adviser. &quot;Now, even the small hope that reform will accomplish something could disappear. If we are lucky, they will pass this law and then never use it. We have many terrible laws in Poland that are never used.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
