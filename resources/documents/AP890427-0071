Jordan was shaken last weekby riots over price increases.   The new Cabinet will act as a caretaker until the country canorganize its first general parliamentary elections in 22 years,King Hussein said in an interview published today with the Kuwaitinewspaper Al-Seyassah.   ``The next government will be a temporary one with a specificassignment, namely speeding up solutions to our problems ... andoverseeing the general elections which will take place very soon,''the king was quoted as saying.   Bin Shaker, 55, was commander in chief of the armed forces untillast year, when the king brought him to the palace as chief of theroyal court and adviser on security affairs.   He is best known outside Jordan as the architect of the army's1970-1971 war to crush Palestinian guerrillas who had threatenedthe stability of the state. The bloodiness of that conflict earnedhim lasting hostility on the part of many Palestinians, but respectfrom native Jordanians who resented the guerrillas' actions intheir country.   The rioting over price rises last week was Jordan's worstdomestic violence since 1971. At least nine people died andgovernment property was smashed in dozens of southern Jordaniantowns and villages.   The unrest occurred almost wholly among disgruntled nativeJordanians in the south, the wellspring of Hussein's support.   The rioters shouted backing for Hussein, but chanted for theouster of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, who was blamed for economicdifficulties that cut per capita income to about $1,200 a year from$2,000 in the mid-1980s.   Rifai resigned with his cabinet on Monday after four years inoffice _ the longest single term by any premier since Jordan gainedindependence in 1946.   Bin Shaker is very distantly related to the king because bothare members of the Hashemite family descended from Islam's ProphetMohammed.   His father, Shaker bin Zeid, came north from the ArabianPeninsula with Hussein's grandfather, Emir Abdullah, the founder ofJordan and served as Abdullah's closest adviser for many years.   Bin Shaker, like Hussein, was educated at Victoria College inEgypt and at Britain's Sandhurst military academy.   He joined the army in 1953, the year Hussein came to power, andwas by the young king's side when Hussein drove out to meet histroops and rally them against a coup d'etat attempt in 1957.   Bin Shaker commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war withIsrael and his reported hostility to Palestinian guerrillas led thePLO to demand his dismissal as assistant chief of army operationsin early 1970.   Hussein complied in a brief attempt to placate the fedayeenguerrillas, but restored Bin Shaker's position on the eve of thearmy's Black September war against the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   The official army history describes him as ``the principlearchitect of the operational plan for neutralization of thefedayeen'' in 1970 and 1971.   Hussein said in a televised address Wednesday night thatelections would be held soon.   Jordan last held general elections for parliament in 1967, justbefore Israel captured the West Bank, which contributed half of thedeputies to the old 60-member parliament.   The king suspended that body last year when he severed linkswith the West Bank. The government recently announced plans for anew parliament with 72 members elected wholly from Jordan itself.</TEXT></DOC>
