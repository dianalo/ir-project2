The price of Walbro common fell nearly 20% after the announcement.    Walbro, a maker of engine and automobile parts, also said a group of employees and directors that controls about 30% of Walbro stock has agreed not to sell any shares until Dec. 31, 1988. In addition, the company said it will use the proceeds from the preferred stock sale to complete a &quot;strategic acquisition.&quot;    Trading in Walbro stock was halted yesterday morning. When it resumed after the company's announcement, the stock immediately dropped to $29 from $31.625 in national over-the-counter trading. The stock, which had traded as high as $32.625 two weeks ago, closed at $25.75.    Whether Walbro's defense will derail a $27.25-a-share tender offer by UIS, a closely held New York auto-parts maker, is unclear. The UIS tender offer expires Oct. 7.    &quot;We find it reprehensible, the action they've taken,&quot; said Jeffrey Lehman of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. Inc., advisers to UIS. The sale of a new issue of voting preferred stock to General Electric Credit Corp., intended to put more of the company's shares in friendly hands, would make an acquisition more difficult, Mr. Lehman said. But he added, &quot;There are a lot of disgruntled shareholders out there.&quot;    As previously reported, UIS three weeks ago began its tender offer for 2.1 million Walbro shares, or about 61% of the company. Walbro opposed the offer, and UIS countered with a proposal to negotiate acquisition of the entire company. In its announcement yesterday, Walbro reaffirmed its opposition to a takeover.    The preferred shares to be purchased by General Electric may be converted beginning in October 1988 into about 1,075,000 shares of common stock, equivalent to about 30% of the common stock currently outstanding. If it converts its shares, General Electric will in effect have paid $32.50 a share for the common. Walbro said General Electric agreed not to sell its stake in Walbro.    UIS is now considering its options, and exploring the legalities of the Walbro move, Mr. Lehman said. </TEXT></DOC>
