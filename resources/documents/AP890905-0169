A little more than two months sincepro-democracy demonstrations shook China, they go about making aliving, haggling in the markets, sitting around talking and playingcards on the sidewalk.   The people of China's most cosmopolitan city seem relaxed andcheerful as they sit under the chestnut trees squeezed between tallgray walls and bustling, narrow streets.   ``Things are about the same as before here,'' said one man,sitting outside the electronics factory where he works. ``We all getthe same salary no matter how hard we work, so we're taking iteasy.''   Like Beijing, Shanghai was hit by protests in May and June whenworkers and students demanding democracy blocked streets with buses,sat on railroad tracks, set a train ablaze, and gathered by the tensof thousands in the city's People's Square.   But unlike Beijing, which has been under martial law since May20, Shanghai's officials did not have to call in the army. Whathappened in Beijing _ the army attacks and the killings _ was enoughto subdue Shanghai.   Historically, Shanghai has been a seat of rebellion in China. TheCommunist Party was formed here in 1921. The seeds of rebellionagainst foreign imperialists germinated here after World War I. FromShanghai, Mao Tse-tung launched his turbulent, ultra-leftist 1966-76Cultural Revolution.   Political repression is much less obvious here than in Beijing,the national capital where police surveillance cameras are trainedon many streets and soldiers with automatic rifles stand watch atmajor intersections and government buildings.   In Shanghai, the cameras are far fewer and police at governmentbuildings carry only small revolvers. A truckload of green-cladsoldiers is a rare enough sight downtown that it draws stares.   Shanghai is China's top manufacturing center and its people dressand eat well. It's also one of the world's most densely populatedcities, with 65,000 people jammed in per square mile, in contrast toabout 23,500 per square mile in New York City.   Markets are filled with shoppers taking time out from the workdayto haggle over fresh and salted fish, red peppers, huge scallionsand fresh noodle dough.   At night, families sitting outside to escape the heat of theirdark, crowded apartments seem relaxed, friendly and willing to chat.   ``Shanghai's all right,'' said a sales clerk in a dry goodsstore. ``We never did get too nervous. There aren't any troopshere.''   A young government official said, ``I'd say things are prettyrelaxed here. Shanghai people are known for business. They don'tcare much for politics.''   Still, the turmoil of May and June, which shook more than 80Chinese cities, has had a deep impact on some aspects of life inShanghai.   For example, the city has seen a sharp decline in foreign tourismand business travelers since the unrest.   ``Before June, I could make about 300 yuan ($81) a month,'' ataxi driver said. ``Now I'm lucky to make 100 yuan ($27).   ``The students don't understand that common people like me needto improve our living standards. Life just isn't comfortable here.''   A second-year science student at Fudan University, whose studentshelped lead the protests, agreed the protests were less popular inShanghai than in Beijing, where hundreds of thousands of peoplerisked their lives to support the students.   ``Most people were somewhere in the middle,'' he said. ``Theydidn't fully support the students, but then they thought what thegovernment did in Beijing was too cruel.   ``Many people, especially older people, still believe insocialism and in the Communist Party. They don't support studentuprisings.''   But officials in Shanghai have taken measures against some of theprotesters and their sympathizers.   The weekly newspaper World Economic Herald, which challengedofficial policies and expressed support for democracy, has beenclosed while its employees, accused of anti-government activities,undergo ``thought reform.''   ``They're correcting their thinking,'' said a guard at thepublication's gate.   Students in Shanghai also face political re-education that couldseriously disrupt their studies. An official report says the citygovernment will set up 500 ``production centers'' to give the city's120,000 college students practical experience and ``enhance theirpolitical consciousness.''   Police arrested more than 150 people in midnight raids followingthe protests, officials say. Ninety-nine others have been arrestedor investigated for allegedly participating in underground politicalgroups. Several dissident writers are reportedly under house arrest.   The student at Fudan University looks cautiously over hisshoulder as he talks to a foreigner.   ``Many students will get black marks in their files that will doa lot of damage later on,'' he said.   ``People certainly haven't forgotten about it, but it's just likea bad dream we don't want to talk about. There's a long road aheadof us.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
