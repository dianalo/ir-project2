(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 3-year-old girl was revived after shewandered out into the snow and froze to the point of clinicaldeath, her body temperature 24 degrees below normal.   Brittany Eichelberger was in critical but stable conditionWednesday at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, nursing supervisorPatty Wentroble said.   Her fingers and toes were frostbitten, but she was sitting up inbed and talking, Wentroble said.   ``The remarkable thing was that the child's body temperature was74 degrees and she was successfully resuscitated,'' said Dr. JohnVeach of Davis Memorial Hospital, where Brittany was revived.   ``She was in complete cardiac arrest with no heart activitiy andno breathing,'' Veach said. ``Because she was so cold, she had adeathlike appearance, and in fact she was dead.''   Brittany was found lying in snow Monday morning clad only in anightgown. It was 27 degrees at the time. Her mother had lastchecked on her five hours earlier.   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and a tube put downBrittany's throat to get her breathing again while she was rushedto the hospital, where she became responsive about three hourslater, Veach said.   Brittany likely will remain hospitalized another three weeks,Wentroble said.</TEXT></DOC>
