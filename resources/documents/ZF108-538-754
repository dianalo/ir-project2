Hallett approved the records review, along withother data quality improvement projects, in response to a barrage ofcriticism from the GAO that questioned the integrity of TECS II data.andM;Riley said GAO's unpublished report mainly targeted the look-out databasethat federal law enforcement agencies use to track the activities ofsuspected criminals.andP;  GAO also faulted the agency for insufficient riskanalyses and data standards, he said.andM;&quot;A lot of the recommendations were to re-emphasize things we have now or tomake things a lot stronger,&quot; Riley said.andM;At Customs' request, GAO officials have not released the report of theiraudit, said Steve Schwartz, assistant director for general governmentinformation systems in GAO's Information Management and Technology Division.andM;Treasury does not &quot;want the bad guys to know how we're strengthening thesystem&quot; nor to pinpoint vulnerabilities in TECS II, said Steve W. Broadbent,deputy assistant secretary for information systems.andM;Until Customs approves a release of the report, GAO officials will discussneither the audit nor Customs proposed corrective actions, Schwartz said.andM;Treasury and other federal agencies use TECS II to collect, store and analyzelaw enforcement data.andM;Linchpin SystemandM;Customs and Treasury officials tout TECS II as one of the most advancedintelligence systems in any civilian agency.andP;  It is considered a linchpin ofthe government's drug control strategy.andM;Although it is ised departmentwide and outside Treasury, Customs manages TECSII.andP;  The database resides on an IBM System 370-type National Advanced SystemsInc. mainframe at a Customs office in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.andM;Customs' response to GAO was two-tiered.andP;  Some projects are under way now,and others are long-term efforts, Riley said.andM;The record review project will encompass the entire TECS II database, eventhough GAO cited only records in the look-out database, Riley said.andP;  &quot;We havedata standards now, but they are being reissued,&quot; he said.andM;Program analysts in the Intelligence Office will examine literally millionsof records in this multiyear project, Riley said.andP;  Because the IntelligenceOffice will handle the project, the review will not affect the day-to-dayoperations of Customs programming staff nor the use of TECS II, he said.andM;The review will emphasize the data gathered about people, rather thanbusinesses and vehicles.andP;  Customs wants the public, GAO and Congress to feelconfident that TECS II does not breach individuals' privacy, Riley said.andM;The service will not start with the first record ever created and simplyadvance chronologically through TECS II, he said.andM;&quot;We're trying to do some things with software first,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We want toapply some kind of analysis to the database.&quot;andP;  Customs officials hope toborrow an expert system in use at the Internal Revenue Service, its sisteragency, that targets specific records for review, he said.andM;The IRS uses this software program to sift through taxpayer data and selectlikely audit targets or suspect filings.andP;  This type of software, whichassigns numeric values to specific types of data, works like a matchingprogram.andM;By assigning numbers to the high-risk categories, &quot;we might be able to weedout those records that we should look at first,&quot; Riley said.andM;A program similar to IRS' program might eliminate an exhaustive slowprogressive search of records, he said.andP;  The analysts could hone in onrecords with information about individuals and leave other data for reviewlater, he said.andM;Meanwhile, Customs has begun work on new data standards, Riley said.andM;Many items reflect common good security practices, such as regular passwordchanges and physical security controls, he added.andP;  Customs plans to addressissues involving the use of the records and the information they contain aswell.andM;Officials are studying plans to perform a new TECS II risk assessmentanalysis.andP;  The service had the system's risks assessed fairly recently, Rileysaid.andP;  &quot;But GAO didn't believe that the existing risk assessment was completeenough&quot; and suggested something more comprehensive, he said.andM;The risk assessment report is at least a year in the offing.andP;  A thoroughanalysis requires several months of research, usually a year, Riley said.andM;Customs would like to use an existing contract but might have to run aseparate procurement, he said.andP;  Treasury and Customs officials are reviewingtheir options now.andM;The Customs plan met with mixed reviews on Capitol Hill.andM;&quot;We are pleased with the steps Customs has taken,&quot; said one House staffmember.andP;  &quot;But we don't know yet whether they will solve the problem.andP;  TECS isa long-term question that we must review again and again.&quot;andM;Rep.andP;  Don Edwards (D-Calif.) long has questioned the appropriate use oflook-out or investigative databases.andP;  As chairman of the House JudiciarySubcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, Edwards has lambasted theuse of similar tracking data by the FBI's National Crime Information Center.andM;&quot;Investigative database are a necessary tool,&quot; a staff member said, but theycan be dangerous without adequate precautions.andP;  Customs needs to havedetailed requirements about what data will be used in such files, who canaccess it, how to maintain its integrity, how it can be corrected and when itshould be removed, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
