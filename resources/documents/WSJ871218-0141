But on a more substantive level, Mr. Hart's re-entry is a sign of increasing voter dissatisfaction with the level and quality of presidential politics.    Modern electoral politics has become a big, expensive, sophisticated business. Maybe too sophisticated. Most of the candidates' policy positions are thoroughly polled, consulted over and ultimately hedged. It's hardly surprising that such a smooth insider's game would eventually start creating interesting outsiders.    Gary Hart, in his current incarnation, is only one of them. Alexander Haig's candidacy drew Hartlike snickers at first, but somehow Mr. Haig continues to draw attention. He tossed political caution aside this week by launching a sharp attack on Vice President Bush and the just-signed INF treaty. &quot;When you have to make decisions rather than avoid making decisions, then you generate a level of animosity as well as a level of support.&quot;    The former general seems to revel in his prickly personality. At the end of the PBS debate recently, he set a torch to the whole, cozy Capitol Hill political system. Indeed Mr. Haig is the only candidate to engage in a frontal attack on Congress for its unconstitutional usurpation of the presidency's foreign-policy and budget powers. He has said &quot;the government becomes a Tower of Babel when Congress tries to be its own State Department.&quot;    The self-resurrected Mr. Hart is also running against the grain. He has mounted a minimalist campaign on the theme that the news media, political power brokers and campaign consultants have too powerful a voice in the presidential race. &quot;I should not decide, the press should not decide, the politicians in Washington should not decide; you ought to decide. Let the people decide,&quot; he said in announcing his candidacy.    Now, it is no secret that Mr. Hart to a great extent was originally the creature of a consultant's elaborate blueprint for winning the White House. And we don't believe Mr. Hart has even begun to properly explain the lapses in judgment that caused his departure from the race in May. He says he re-entered the race because &quot;new ideas&quot; weren't being offered by the other candidates.    There is more fat than lean meat on many of his proposals. But Mr. Hart's anti-establishment rhetoric has echoes of the 1960s when both Eugene McCarthy on the left and George Wallace on the right argued that the Democratic Party was closed to insurgent forces and ignoring important issues.    Two other candidates considered out of the mainstream of their parties, Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson, also have shown surprising political strength. Both take controversial stands and tweak their more cautious rivals; that has earned them a large core of committed supporters. Similarly, Pete du Pont's advocacy of nonmainstream reforms in education, Social Security and farm policy has lifted him into third place in the polls in New Hampshire.    Harry Truman whistle-stopped the country in 1948 campaigning against a parochial, &quot;do-nothing&quot; Congress that would not enact his legislative program. He struck a chord in the American people, not only winning a stunning upset but also defeating scores of Republican congressmen in the process. Truman recognized that a presidential contest is not just a race among candidates but also an opportunity to debate great issues such as the proper separation of powers.    Though he is almost certain to join Messrs. McCarthy and Wallace in political retirement, Mr. Hart may serve a useful function in prying ajar an encrusted political process in which candidates endlessly debate only the crossing of t's and the dotting of i's in public policy. These candidates tend to think the spotlight shines only on them, but much of the public fully understands by now that most of these men don't say &quot;boo&quot; without clearing it through their consultants or an opinion poll. At bottom, the process has come to be seen as overrefined political white sugar.    If Gary Hart draws a sizable protest vote in the early primaries it will be a signal to the other candidates that voters are tired of the trivialization of politics and are ripe for a discussion of broader, bolder themes. </TEXT></DOC>
