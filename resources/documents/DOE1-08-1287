<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-1287 </DOCNO><TEXT>A calorimeter module of 17 radiation lengths depth has been built. Wavelengthshifter (WLS) bars coupled to rectangular silicon photodiodes (PDs) areused as readout. Considerations in the design of the WLS bars, with particularemphasis on optimising the efficiency for PD readout, are discussed.The energy resolution for electrons has been determined to be about 9%/{radical}Ebetween 2 and 50 GeV. The response to hadrons is presented and the prospectsfor the construction of a full-sized hadron calorimeter are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
