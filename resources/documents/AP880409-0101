The ministers, at the end of a full day of closed-door meetings,made no recommendations for immediate OPEC action to combat theslipping prices, said Nigeria's Rilwanu Lukman, who was chairman ofthe session.   He said he and the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Algeria,Venezuela and Indonesia would invite at least seven non-OPEC oilproducing nations to meet with them in Vienna on April 23 todiscuss ways of cooperating to stabilize oil prices.   Lukman declined to identify the non-OPEC countries, but industrysources said they would be Mexico, Egypt, Oman, Angola, Brunei,Malaysia and Colombia.   When asked, Lukman said he would not rule out invitingrepresentatives also from the Soviet Union and Norway. The Sovietsare the world's largest oil producers.   Oil ministers of all 13 members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries will then meet in Vienna on April 25, Lukmansaid. He suggested that the non-OPEC representatives might be askedto attend that session as official observers.   OPEC had not previously planned to hold any meetings until itsregularly scheduled summer conference June 8.   Lukman said the five ministers had decided that special meetingswere needed to ``look into the situation generally in the market''and to consider ways of cooperating with non-OPEC countries.   OPEC oil ministers held two meetings with representatives ofMexico, Angola, Egypt, Malaysia, Oman and Brunei in the spring of1986, but the cartel was unsuccessful in persuading those countriesto reduce their production.   This time the situation is different, according to Lukman.   ``Non-OPEC (countries) have, on their own, realized the need tocooperate'' among themselves and with OPEC, Lukman told reportersafter the meeting.   OPEC often has declared in recent years that it alone cannot beexpected to bear the burden of cutting production in order tostablize oil prices.   OPEC controls only about 35 percent of the total world oilsupply, down from more than 60 percent in the late 1970s.   Lukman said the separate April 25 meeting of all 13 OPEC memberswas called because of the severity of the recent price decline.   ``The price is not what we expected it to be'' after havingdecided last December to maintain strict oil production limits, hesaid.   Oil prices in the open market are at least $3 below OPEC'sofficial target level of $18 a barrel.   Lukman said Saturday's meeting had made no recommendation aboutwhether OPEC should reduce its production, either unilaterally orjointly with non-OPEC producers, as a way of boosting prices.   He said increased production by non-OPEC producers this year waspartly responsible for the oil price slump.   Although Iran was not invited to Saturday's meeting, its deputyoil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, flew to Vienna and met separatelywith members of the group.   He said later in an interview in his hotel room that Iran hadproposed that OPEC cut its production by at least 5 percentimmediately. He said this should be done with or without parallelaction by non-OPEC oil-producing countries.   Ardebili accused some OPEC members, which he did not name, ofsabotaging Iranian initiatives to boost prices by cutting output.His comments appeared to be directed at Saudi Arabia, an opponentof further cuts in OPEC's share of the world oil market.   Persian Iran has been at war with Arab Iraq since September1980, and Iran often accuses other Arab countries of supportingIraq directly or indirectly in the conflict. Both Iran and Iraqcount on revenues from oil exports to help finance their warefforts.</TEXT></DOC>
