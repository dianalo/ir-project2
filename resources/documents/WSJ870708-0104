After years of steady growth, attendance had flattened out at around 400,000 a year and didn't look to be improving soon. Today, the Texas museum is thriving, with attendance expected to reach 1.1 million this year.    The big draw: an $8.5 million movie theater, opened in 1983, with a domedshaped screen 80-feet across featuring images up to 10-times the size of those in ordinary movies.    Science museums are increasingly turning down their lights and pulling in the crowds with such giant-screen theaters. They are part of the museums' new emphasis on marketing to broaden their appeal and to hedge against rising costs and government funding cuts.    About 15 U.S. museums now have giant-screen theaters, and at least five more are planning to install them in the next few years. While some criticize the theaters as more entertaining than educational, the museums say they need such attractions to set themselves apart from other activities that siphon off potential museum-goers.    &quot;We're living in a crowded electronic village,&quot; says John W. Jacobson, associate director of the Boston Museum of Science, which opened a $10 million giant-screen theater in March. &quot;We've had to fight with the local movie houses and other diversions to get people to come.&quot;    The theaters cost $5 million to $12 million to build, but museums typically pay for them through private donations and fund-raising drives. And although the theaters are expensive to maintain and promote, the museums say the operating cost is more than offset by increases in attendance and, in most cases, by revenue from theater-ticket sales. While the museums also are trying to attract crowds with other special exhibits -- from laser shows to animated dinosaurs -- few have the drawing power of the big-screen theaters.    &quot;This is one way to really turn people on to science education,&quot; says Elizabeth Wideman, vice president of the Louisville Museum of Natural History. Next summer, the Louisville museum plans to open its own mega-theater, which it hopes will double its 165,000 annual attendance.    The movies on the museum circuit feature such topics as the space shuttle and the Grand Canyon. What makes these short films appealing are the huge images -- from overwhelming closeups to dizzying action shots -- of everything from shuttle launches to flying insects, projected on screens about 80-feet tall and 60-feet wide.    Not everyone is convinced, however, that such movies, also popular at theme parks and World's Fairs, belong in science museums. &quot;I don't know if the films deliver a whole lot of science content,&quot; says Alan J. Friedman, director of the Hall of Science in Queens, New York. &quot;Most of them so far have been travelogues.&quot;    Nonetheless, the films bring in the crowds, largely by appealing beyond the museums' traditional audiences of school groups and families with kids. At most giant-screen showings, adults account for 80% of the audience, and many of the musems keep their theaters open weekday evenings so people who work can attend.    &quot;The theater is definitely attracting an older crowd,&quot; says Mr. Jacobson of the Boston museum.    Tom Martini, a 24-year-old bookkeeper from Hyde Park, Mass., for example, hadn't visited the Boston science museum in years, but went one recent night after friends had told him about the new theater. &quot;I'm psyched for the movie,&quot; he said on his way to the show. &quot;I heard it's like 3-D but you don't need the glasses.&quot;    The Boston museum initially predicted its theater would draw 500,000 visitors in its first year; in the first 13 weeks the theater's attendance already had reached 200,000. At the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry's theater, which opened last July, first-year attendance was nearly 900,000, 50% more than expected.    Aside from any museum admission fee, most theaters usually charge $3 to $5 for tickets to hourly shows. Although the theaters tend to cost about $1 million a year to operate, they generally return a profit of $100,000 to $500,000, helping to pay for exhibits and other museum expenses. The movies also generate increased traffic through gift shops and cafeterias.    The theaters have helped some museums out of financial crises. The Denver Museum of Natural History, for instance, was in danger of closing after its public funding was cut sharply in 1982. The museum responded by increasing advertising, adding exhibits -- and opening a giant-screen theater. In 1983, the museum's attendance rose to 743,000, from 550,000 in 1982, and has topped 1.1 million in recent years. The movie theater &quot;has been a big help,&quot; says Tom Garrity, the Denver museum's director of marketing.    The theaters haven't been as successful for some museums. At the Detroit Science Center, the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the California Museum of Science in Los Angeles, theater attendance averages less than 300,000 a year. All three say their theaters are selfsupporting, but not moneymakers. The Detroit theater has been hindered by the museum's location downtown, and high advertising costs have kept the New York and Los Angeles museums from widely promoting their theaters.    Even for museums that have benefited from the giant-screen theaters, there are drawbacks. The movies require special equipment to film and produce, and the theaters have only about 50 movies to choose from so far. The shortage has prompted several science museums to start producing and distributing their own films. The Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, for instance, has spent $3.25 million on five movies over the past eight years, and a network of six museums is pouring $3.5 million into a 37-minute feature on human endurance, to be released in time for next summer's Olympics.    &quot;This is not a medium for Rambos or traditional Hollywood love stories,&quot; says Mr. Jacobson of Boston.    Still, show biz apparently is here to stay for science museums. &quot;Museums have got to sell better to gain a larger share of the leisure dollar,&quot; says Joel Bloom, president of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, which is raising $40 million for an expansion that will include a giant-screen theater. &quot;We've changed our advertising strategy, and we've got a new jingle, too.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
