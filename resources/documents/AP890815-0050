The 200-year-old former home of the Supreme Court was the settingMonday for the Senate Judiciary Committee's second hearing on whataction, if any, should be taken in response to the Supreme Court'sJune decision that flag burning represents protected politicalspeech.   The Bush administration and leading Republicans in Congresssupport a constitutional amendment that would permit states tooutlaw destruction of the flag.   But a Philadelphia-based federal judge and two constitutionalhistorians asked the committee Monday to show restraint.   Flag burning, while carrying powerful emotional weight, is not aserious enough offense to merit the curtailment of free-speechprotections, said federal Judge Louis Pollak, the former dean of theUniversity of Pennsylvania law school.   ``I urge you not to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Billof Rights, not to celebrate that anniversary by submitting aproposed amendment which would dilute protections of the FirstAmendment,'' Pollak said.   The session was considered an official judiciary panel hearing,even though Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Chairman Joseph Biden,D-Del., were the only members present. The hearing was held at the200-year-old former city hall, which housed the U.S. Supreme Courtfrom 1791 until 1800.   Fifty-three senators have agreed to sponsor a constitutionalamendment, Specter said, noting that ``there is a considerablepolitical downside'' to not going along, since so many Americanswere outraged by the high court ruling.   ``I confess to being one of those who was indignant (at the courtdecision),'' Specter said. Still, Specter said he would prefer thatCongress simply pass a bill outlawing flag desecration; Biden agreed   Proponents of the amendment argue that such a sweeping statementis needed because a bill might not pass constitutional muster withthe high court. An amendment would require a two-thirds majorityvote in the House and Senate, and ratification by three-quarters ofthe states.   ``I would like to see the Congress of the United States take thethird option of doing nothing,'' Pollak said. ``Doing nothing may bethe hardest of the options,'' the judge said.   Specter replied: ``I disagree with you, Judge Pollak, that doingnothing may be the hardest thing to do. We are experts at that.''   Law professor Stanley Kutler of the University of Wisconsin andhistory professor Michael Parrish of the University ofCalifornia-San Diego urged Congress not to overreact.   Kutler compared the flag issue to prohibition, which came aboutwith the 18th Amendment and was later repealed. In both cases, hesaid, ``emotion ruled.''</TEXT></DOC>
