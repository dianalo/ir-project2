Forsteel 22K, high tensile properties were achieved at normal and elevatedtemperatures by optimizing the chemical composition, increasing the rateof cooling from normalizing temperature, and by rolling thick sheets(75 to 80 mm). The basic technology is described of heat treatment whichis dependent on the thickness of the sheet being worked. For steel 10GN2MFA,quality heat treatment improved fineness of grain, thus improving themechanical properties. The effects of annealing temperature and austenitizingtemperature were studied on the mechanical properties of the steel aswas the dependence of the mechanical properties on the sheet thickness.For steel 38KhN2MFA, the optimal regime of quality heat treatment wasdetermined and the optimal tempering temperature as well as the optimaldwell time at the tempering temperature were tested. Satisfactory tensileproperties were achieved and a high value of the yield point was obtained.(E.S.). 8 figs., 2 tabs., 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
