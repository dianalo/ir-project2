The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, inreleasing the findings, issued its strongest warning yetabout the quickening deterioration of the ozone layer overlarge, populated areas in northern latitudes. That warningmay increase political pressure to speed up the eliminationof such chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons, which are used asrefrigerants and destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere.Experts warn that thinning ozone will let in more harmfulultraviolet rays from the sun and lead to more skin cancerand cancer deaths.</LP><TEXT>   An ozone-layer hole could appear as early as this month ifcertain meteorological and chemical conditions occur, saidthe project scientists, who discussed their findings at anews conference. Even if a hole doesn't develop right away,the chances are &quot;very high&quot; that it will occur over the nextdecade, said James Anderson, a Harvard University chemistryprofessor who is involved in the project.   The results, agreed Michael Kurylo, manager of NASA'sUpper Atmosphere Research Program, indicate &quot;an everincreasing danger for ozone depletion.&quot;   The record reading occurred Jan. 20 during tests in whichplanes carrying scientific instruments make observations ofchemical levels in the atmosphere. The program, which beganin October with flights from Fairbanks, Alaska, continued inDecember and January with flights from Bangor, Maine.   During a flight from Bangor, scientists found the highestlevels of chlorine monoxide ever recorded: 1.5 parts perbillion by volume. Chlorine monoxide, which can destroyozone, results primarily from CFCs and other industrialproducts released at the earth's surface.   Data gathered by the aircraft also showed that nitrogenoxides, which help prevent ozone loss, are themselvesdepleted in the lower polar stratosphere. &quot;The immune systemof the atmosphere . . . is weaker than we thought before,&quot;said Mr. Anderson.   The findings were supported by separate data gathered by aNASA satellite, officials said. On Jan. 11, for example, thesatellite found high levels of chlorine monoxide over London,Moscow and Amsterdam.   Satellite data also suggested that the eruption of MountPinatubo in the Philippines may have had an effect on theozone layer above the tropics. The scientists said that thevolcanic debris apparently triggers a chemical reaction thatleads to a loss of ozone.   Under an international agreement, industrial countries arerequired to halt production of CFCs and some other chemicalsby the year 2000. But Du Pont Co. and other producers havesaid they support a faster phaseout for some of thechemicals.</TEXT></DOC>
