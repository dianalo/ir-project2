In addition,certain ceramic materials can play a unique structural role in fusionpower reactors by virtue of their very low induced radioactivity fromfusion neutron capture. The aspects of safety, long-term radioactivewaste management, and personnel access for maintenance and repair canall be significantly improved by applying the low-activation ceramicsto the structural materials of the first-wall and blanket regions ofa fusion reactor. Achievement of long service life at high structuralloads and thermal stresses on the materials exposed to high-radiationdoses presents a critical challenge for fusion. In this paper, we discussradiation effects on structural ceramics for fusion application.</TEXT></DOC>
