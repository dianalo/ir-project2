Hodel saidWednesday he won't force the National Park Service to change itsfire-fighting policy, but he repeated his belief that the ``let itburn'' policy had been a failure and predicted modifications willbe made before the next fire season.   ``I think we'll just have to see what they come up with as arecommendation,'' Hodel said in an interview, referring to thepolicy review just getting under way by the service in cooperationwith the Forest Service and other agencies. ``I'm not planning toimpose a policy.''   Comments by environmentalists and others that the ``let itburn'' policy had succeeded were ``a backfire'' by people who fearchanges, he said.   ``Let it burn'' is how the Park Service unofficially describedits practice since 1972 of letting most naturally caused fires burnthemselves out for the benefits they bring to forest regeneration.   The policy called for fighting fires that threatened humansettlement and property, significant park structures and resources,and all fires started by humans.   On July 21, pressed by the worst fire season in 300 or 400 yearsin Yellowstone National Park and the rest of the West, the ParkService decided to fight all fires because it could not be surethan any one would not get out of control. It extended that``suppression'' policy to all its parks in August.   The service has argued that the buildup of dead trees and otherfuel from the 100 years of suppressing all fires before 1972 couldnot be burned off in the 16 years since then, and that buildup madethis year's fires far worse than they should have been, resultingin fire over nearly half of the park in blazes that could not havebeen put out no matter when they were attacked.   Some environmental groups have argued that the policy worked andshould be supported, and that no one could have predicted theseverity of the drought or the fires. Leaders of these supportinggroups usually add that people living around Yellowstone _ the mostvigorous critics of the policy _ deserve some help for the damagedone to their businesses by the decline in tourism.   ``I don't think the majority of the American people would saythis policy has worked and I would say the American people areright,'' Hodel said.   Asked to define a successful policy, the secretary replied:``I'd rather define what is not successful. A policy is notsuccessful if the result'' subjects communities in and near thepark ``to extreme jeopardy and evacuations because you didn't knowif you were going to be able to control the fires,'' as happenedthis year.   He said he believed the Park Service policy change July 21 hadhappened ``fairly quickly'' in the light of available information.Asked whether that change was made quickly enough, he responded,``I'm not going to engage in that kind of thing because the Mondaymorning quarterback never gets sacked.''   Noting that William Penn Mott, director of the Park Service, andDale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, had admitted that inhindsight they would have fought every fire from the beginning,Hodel said he thought Park Service officials were not satisfiedwith the results of the ``let it burn'' policy either.   Asked if he were trying to satisfy both critics of the serviceas well as the service and its supporters, he replied: ``No. I'mtrying to be responsive to the best professional and technicaladvice.''</TEXT></DOC>
