The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Case History</ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 23300, June 21, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On July 11, 1988, the ITC found that there is a reasonableindication that imports of headwear from the PRC are materially injuring,or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry (U.S. ITC Pub. No. 2096,July 1988).On August 10, 1988, we presented a questionnaire to counsel for China NationalArts andamp; Crafts Import andamp; Export Corporation and China National LightIndustrial Products Import andamp; Export Corporation, major PRC exportersof the subject merchandise to the United States. On September 26, 27, 29,and October 4, 7, and 13, we received replies to this questionnaire fromeight respondents who now claim to be operating as independent export tradingcompanies rather than as branches of these firms. Universal Hats and Caps Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and Universal TradingCompany (Universal) have asked to participate in this proceeding as a respondent.Universal is a Hong Kong company which supplies materials to the PRC factoriesfor conversion into headwear under processing fee arrangements with thePRC trading companies. Universal argues that it should be treated as theproducer and exporter of the headwear sold under processing fee arrangements.In other proceedings involving processing fee-like arrangements, we havetreated the processor as the producer/manufacturer/exporter and have basedUnited States price on the price paid for processing. (See, <T3>e.g.</T3>, <T3>Small Diameter Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines,Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value</T3>, (51 Fr 33099,September 18, 1986), (<T3>Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines</T3>); <T3>Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada, Final Determination of Sales atLess Than Fair Value</T3>, (51 FR 44319, December 9, 1986), (<T3>Canadian Brass Sheet and Strip</T3>).)Moreover, under Department practice, where a producer knows that the merchandiseis destined for the United States, we base United States price on the pricecharged by the producer. In this case, the PRC companies are aware thatthe processing fee sales are destined for the United States because theymust supply the export visas required under the U.S.-PRC bilateral textileagreement.For these reasons, we notified Universal and Golden Crown, another HongKong company which supplies materials to the PRC factories for conversioninto headwear under processing fee arrangements, on September 7, 1988,that we would not be sending them a questionnaire nor considering a questionnaireresponse from them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>The Department and the ITC have received letters from RCC; Weisman NoveltyCompany, Inc.; Manhattan Miami Sales Company; Betty Ann American SalesCorporation; Arlington Hat Company, Inc.; Triangle Sport Headwear Company,Inc.; Jacobson Hat Company, Inc.; Diversified Graphics, Inc.; HeadwearU.S.A., Ltd.; Midway Chinese Products Inc. and Universal Headwear Industriesindicating that the petitioner did not speak on behalf of, or represent,their organization. On July 25, 1988, we received a letter from the respondentschallenging Headwear Institute of America's (HIA) standing to file thepetition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the grounds that thepetition was not filed ``on behalf of'' the United States industry, asrequired by section 732(b)(1) of the Act.The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry'' (section732(b)(1)of the Act). As we have stated in prior cases (<T3>see e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February26, 1987); <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia</T3> (50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985)),the Department relies upon the petitioner's representation that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is affirmativelyshown that a majority of the domestic industry opposes the petition. TheDepartment bases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor itslegislative history restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiringthat parties petitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmativelythat a majority of the members of the relevant domestic industry supportthe petition. The only requirement is that the party filing the petitionact as the representative of the domestic industry. As we have noted inother cases, to require a petitioner to establish affirmatively that ithas the support of a majority of the industry on whose behalf it has filedthe petition would, in many cases, ``be so onerous as to preclude accessto import relief under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws.''<T3>Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice from Brazil; Final Determination ofSales at Less than Fair Value </T3>(52 FR 8324, 8325, March 17, 1987).When a member (or members) of the domestic industry challenges the assertionof the petitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry,the Department will examine the challenge. When evaluating the challenge,the Department does not consider a statement by a member of the domesticindustry that it does not take any position with respect to the petitionas evidence of opposition to a petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorityof the domestic industry. Commerce tailors its examination of oppositionto the particular facts of the case. Typically, the Department does notcanvass the entire domestic industry. Instead, it generally requests theopponent to supply information on the nature and extent of its involvementin the domestic industry. By accumulating the proportion of the domesticindustry that is represented by each of the parties in opposition, theDepartment is able to determine the degree of opposition overall. Thiswas the course followed by the Department in this case.On August 12, 1988 and August 29, 1988, we sent letters and questionnairesto the aforementioned companies requesting information as to the natureand extent of the companies' activities, including their production ofheadwear in the United States and their percentage share of the UnitedStates market. We received three replies, which together represented lessthan five percent of the United States market.Absent evidence of opposition to the petition by other members of the domesticindustry, the Department has no basis to conclude that a majority of theindustry opposed the petition. Therefore, the Department preliminarilydetermines in this case that the petition was filed on behalf of the domesticindustry, and that the petitioner has standing to bring this petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to this HarmonizedTariff Schedule (``HTS''). Until that time, the Department will be providingboth the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (``TSUSA'')item numbers and the appropriate HTS item numbers with our product descriptionson a test basis. As with the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided forconvenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item numbersas well as the TSUSA item numbers in all new petitions filed with the Department.A reference copy of the proposed Harmonized System schedule is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Wasington, DC 20230.Additionally, all Customs offices have reference copies, and petitionersmay contact the Import Specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.Imports covered by this investigation are caps, hats, and visors made fromknitted or woven cloth of vegetable fibers including cotton, flax, andramie, of man-made fibers, and/or of blends thereof, and which is cut andsewn. The subject headwear may be adorned with braid, embroidery, or otherapplied, printed or sewn decoration of may be plain. This investigationdoes not include headwear of straw, felt or wool. The products are classifiedunder the TSUSA item numbers 702.0600, 702.0800, 702.1200, 702.1400, 702.2000,702.3200, 703.0510, 703,0520, 703.0530, 703.0540, 703.0550, 703.0560, 703.1000,703.1610, 703.1620, 703.1630, 703.1640, 703.1650, 384.0438, 384.0954, 384.2211,384.2608, 384.2707, 384.2723, 384.2741, 384.2752, 384.2784, 384.2796, 384.3436,384.5216, 384.5365, 384.5427, 384.5485, 384.5533, 384.5685, 384.5698, 384.8676,384.9443 and currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 6505.90.15,6505.90.20, 6505.90.25, 6505.90.90, 6502.00.20, 6502.00.90, 6504,00.90,6505.90.50, 6505.90.70, 6505.90.60, 6505.90.80, 6114.20.00, 6211.42.00,6114.30.30, 6211.43.00, 6114.30.20, 6104.49.00, 6204.51.00, 6204.23.00,6204.29.40, 6211.32.00, 6110.90.00, 6204.12.00, 6211.49.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparison</ITAG>To determine whether sales of the subject merchandise in the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States pricewith the foreign market value.For this merchandise, there are two types of sales: processing fee andnon-processing fee. Consistent with past practice, we have based UnitedStates price for the processing fee sales on the price received for convertingthe purchasers' materials into headwear. (<T3>See, e.g., Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines, Canadian Brass Sheetand Strip</T3>). Foreign market value for processing fee sales has beencalculated by valuing the factors of production employed by the PRC manufacturersin performning the conversion in a non-state-controlled economy country,as described in the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice.For non-processing fee sales, the United States price is based on the pricescharged by the PRC trading companies for finished headwear. The foreignmarket value for these sales has been calculated using home market salesin a non-state-controlled economy or PRC factors of production valued ina non-state-controlled economy, as described in the ``Foreign Market Value''section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>We used the purchase price of the subject merchandise to represent UnitedStates price because the merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers priorto its importation into the United States. We calculated the purchase priceof the subject merchandise as provided in section 772 of the Act, on thebasis of the Candamp;F or CIF prices with deductions, where applicable, forocean freight, marine insurance, and for non-processing fee sales, an adjustmentfor related value-added tax.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>The petitioner has alleged that the PRC is a state-controlled economy and,therefore, that sales of headwear in the PRC do not permit a determinationof foreign market value under section 773(a) of the Act. The PRC tradingcompanies, however, argue that as a result of economic reforms in the PRC,particularly with respect to the headwear industry, state control is notso great as to preclude the determination of foreign market value undersection 773(a).As a result of the trading companies' argument, we sent a questionnaireto the trading companies on August 29, 1988, seeking information on: (1)The degree of government ownership of the means of production; (2) thedegree of centralized government control over input ``markets;'' (3) thedegree of centralized government control over output ``markets;'' and (4)the relative convertibility of the country's currency and the degree ofgovernment control over trade. We had identified these criteria as thebases for determining whether a country is state-controlled within themeaning of section 773(c) in <T3>Petroleum Wax Candles From the People's Republic of China: Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value</T3> (51 FR 25085, July 10, 1986), (<T3>Candles</T3>).We received responses to our questionnaire on September 26 and October7. The responses provide the following information:<T3>The Degree of Government Ownership of the Means of Production:</T3>The trading company respondents in this investigation are local branchesof the state-owned trading companies, China National Arts and Crafts Importand Export Corporation and China National Light Industrial Products Importand Export Corporation. According to information submitted by the tradingcompanies, the local branches have operated as autonomous entities sinceJanuary 1, 1988 and are now responsible for their own profits and losses.The trading companies are also subject to the bankruptcy law. After-taxprofits for these firms go toward employee welfare and benefits, businessexpansion, and retained earnings. While none of the trading companies sustaineda loss during the period of investigation, these companies claim that losseswould be financed through retained earnings or through borrowing.With respect to the factories producing headwear for the United Statesmarket, four of them are state-owned, 16 are collective-owned and six areforeign-owned enterprises. (The foreign-owned factories are owned in conjunctionwith collectives.) According to the responses, the factories' after-taxprofits are used for worker welfare and bonuses, and for business promotionand expansion. Like the trading companies, the responses claim that anylosses incurred by the factories would have to be financed out of retainedearnings or through borrowing. The factories' business or production plansare not reported to the government. Finally, management in the state-ownedfactories is usually selected by the workers, sometimes with formal approvalby the local government. Management in the collective-owned firms is selectedby the collective. Foreign owners appoint the management of the foreign-ownedfactories.<T3>The Degree of Government Control Over the Input Markets: </T3>The majorphysical inputs used in producing the headwear under investigation arecotton and polyester. The decision of which inputs to use is based on customerspecifications. The materials for processing fee sales are received fromthe Hong Kong customers. With respect to other sales, the polyester isimported and all such importations are through the trading companies, accordingto the responses.Cotton is purchased domestically from state-owned enterprises and collectives.The choice of suppliers is based on the prices charged and the availabilityof supply. According to the responses, prices between the factories andtheir suppliers are set through arm's length negotiations and the quantitiessupplied are determined by the parties. There are no government policydirectives applying to these decisions.Non-physical inputs include capital, labor and energy. Electricity andwater are supplied by state-owned enterprises at prices established bythose enterprises. Capital equipment is frequently imported, accordingto the responses.With respect to labor, the responses state that wages are established bythe factory owners and that there are no general restrictions on seekingnew employment. Additionally, there are no government restrictions on thehiring of workers and workers may be fired for cause. Compensation forworkers includes wages, welfare benefits and bonuses, which are usuallybased on performance.According to the responses, the overall level of credit is controlled bythe central authorities, but loans to individual enterprises are decidedupon by individual banks based on the applicant's creditworthiness. Theinterest rate charged is determined by the individual bank.<T3>The Degree of Government Control Over Output Markets:</T3> There arethree types of prices in the PRC: State-controlled (set by the government),guidance prices (prices which are permitted to fluctuate within a bandaround a state-controlled price), and market prices (set without governmentintervention). Respondents' submissions state that all headwear producedfor domestic sale in the PRC falls into the third category. Moreover, theyclaim that decisions by the factories on what merchandise to produce arenot subject to government direction.Sales of headwear to be exported to the United States are negotiated betweenthe factories and the trading companies. The trading company will placean order with the factory and prices are negotiated at arm's length. Thedecision of which factory to approach is based on the type of headwearinvolved and the available capacity at the factory.Export sales by the trading companies depend on foreign demand. After receivingan order, the trading company will seek a price quote from a factory. Thetrading company then adds an amount to cover its profit and overhead. Accordingto the responses, the trading companies' decisions are not subject to governmentreview and no policy directives apply to these decisions.<T3>Currency Convertibility and the Degree of Government Control Over Trade:</T3>According to the responses, the PRC has an official exchange rate and amarket exchange rate. The official rate applies to foreign exchange remittedto the central government. The market rate refers to the foreign currencyadjustment price negotiated by buyers and sellers in the recently openedforeign exchange adjustment centers. All state-owned, collective-ownedand foreign-owned enterprises have access to these centers, regardlessof whether they export.Respondent's submissions state that the trading companies can keep up to70 percent of their foreign exchange earnings, while those involved inprocessing arrangements can retain up to 90 percent of their foreign exchangeincome. A portion of these retained earnings are then returned to the factoriesbased on terms arrived at through negotiation between the parties. According to the responses, there are no restrictions on imports of headwearinto the PRC, and the only controls on headwear exports to the United Statesare the visas required under the U.S.-PRC bilateral textile agreement.Headwear exports to countries other than the United States with which thePRC does not have a textile agreement are not subject to any restrictions.Petitioner has also filed submissions on the issue of state control inthis proceeding. According to the petitioner, the respondents are state-ownedandd the factories are owned and/or controlled by the PRC central and localgovernments. Indeed, they assert, factories may not be constructed or expanded,nor can they improve production processes by purchasing imported machineryor equipment, without government approval. The supply of cloth, the major raw material in headwear, is controlledby the Ministry of Textile Industry, which sets output quotas and pricesfor textile mills. Headwear factories are allocated a certain amount offabric by the state, and must receive approval and an allocation of foreignexchange to order imported cloth. Wage scales are centrally determined,managers are not free to hire and fire workers, and the workers themselvesare not free to move to different employment opportunities. The petitioner further contends that foreign purchasers cannot negotiatedirectly with the factories; instead, they can only deal with the tradingcompanies, which determine the product orientation, scale of production,and sales prices and quantities for headwear manufacturers. The PRC governmentlimits the right to export products under the relevant product category(category 359-0) of the Multifiber Arrangement. The allocation under thatcategory for headwear is small due to its low value in relation to higher-valuednon-headwear products also covered by that category. In addition, petitioner maintains that the currency of the PRC, the renminbi,is fundamentally inconvertible. The government tightly controls the supplyof foreign currency and allocation of foreign exchange. The official ratehas been essentially pegged to the U.S. dollar at a constant rate sincethe fourth quarter of 1986. The use of foreign exchange swap centers isstill commercially insignificant, and all transactions in these centersmust be approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control, whichhas imposed a yuan (the unit of currency)/U.S. dollar ceiling rate. Finally, petitioner also states that section 773(c) requires the Departmentto examine whether the PRC economy in general is state-controlled, ratherthan analyzing the headwear sector in particular. For the reasons explainedbelow, we do not need to address this issue for the preliminary determination.Based upon our review of the record in this investigation, we have concludedthat information pertaining to certain key issues is unpersuasive. Forexample, the trading companies involved in exporting headwear to the UnitedStates may be subject to export earning targets. Furthermore, the responsesindicate that headwear manufacturers choose their suppliers ``based onprice and availability of supply,'' and that ``to the best of the tradingcompany's knowledge, prices and quantities are set in a similar mannerwhen these suppliers sell to other customers in the domestic market.''However, like most agricultural products, raw cotton appears to be purchasedunder contract between the growers and the government. Therefore, the pricesand quantities supplied for a major input into headwear may be heavilyinfluenced by direct government involvement in its distribution.We note that a similar claim of no state control was made in <T3>Candles. </T3>In that case, respondents made in their written submissionsa plausible case for finding an absence of state control with respect tothe candle industry in the PRC. However, upon verification, the Departmentfound that the actual situation concerning the production and sale of candlesin the PRC was much more complicated than the situation described in respondents'written submissions. At vertification, the Department found that, indeed,economic reform in the PRC had resulted in a lessening of state control.The candle factories investigated were managed by, or operated under theauspices of, collectives, and their output was not subject to quotas orprice controls.On the other hand, the Department found that the principal input, petroleumwax, remained subject to state control. The Department concluded in thatcase that the extent of state control in the PRC at that time continuedto be too great to permit the use of section 773(a).In every prior antidumping investigation involving the PRC, the Departmenthas found the PRC to be state-controlled. In addition, our experience in<T3>Candles </T3>taught us that verification is extremely important indetermining whether an industry is substantially unaffected by state control.Therefore, given the conflicting, and as yet unverified, evidence on therecord, the continued importance of state economic planning in the PRCgenerally, and the importance and complexity of the issue, we are not persuadedat this time that the headwear sector is substantially free of state control.Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that the PRC is state-controlledto such an extent as to preclude the use of section 773(a). In making thispreliminary determination, we are particularly influenced by the factsthat the trading companies may be subject to foreign exchange targets andthat the principal input obtained domestically, cotton cloth, may stillbe subject to state control, as well as by the conflicting evidence concerningforeign exchange controls, especially the convertibility of the renminbi.However, we intend to conduct a thorough verification of this issue. If,as a result of our verification, we conclude that economic reforms in thePRC have resulted in a sufficient lessening of state control with respectto the headwear industry, in our final determination we will determinewhether to calculate foreign market value pursuant to section 773(a). Inthis regard, we are issuing our standard antidumping questionnaire to respondentsso that we will be able to use section 773(a), if warranted, in our finaldetermination.As a result of our preliminary determination to treat the PRC as a state-controlledeconomy, section 773(c) of the Act requires us to use either the pricesof or the constructed value of such or similar merchandise in a ``non-state-controlled-economy''country. Our regulations establish a preference for foreign market valuebased upon sales prices. They further stipulate that, to the extent possible,we should determine sales prices on the basis of prices in a ``non-state-controlled-economy''country at a stage of economic development comparable to the state-controlled-economycountry. We determined that Indonesia, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic,Jamaica, Paraguay, Zambia and the Philippines were at a level of economicdevelopment comparable to the PRC and it would, therefore, be appropriateto base foreign market value on their prices. We sent questionnaires toknown manufacturers of headwear in the Philippines, Morocco and Jamaica.One manufacturer from the Philippines replied to our questionnaire. Where possible, we used information on domestic sales provided by this``surrogate'' producer as the foreign market value for PRC sales of polyesterbaseball hats. For processing fee sales, we constructed foreign marketvalue by valuing the factors of production employed by the PRC manufacturersin performing the conversion using factor cost information provided bythe surrogate. For sales of cotton hats, we constructed foreign marketvalue by valuing the factors of production employed by the PRC manufacturersbased on factor cost information provided by the surrogate for all elementsexcept the cotton input. For the value of the cotton input, we based thefactor information on the prices of imports into the U.S. from Egypt. FMVbased on valuing factors of production includes the statutory minimum forSGandamp;A and profit. On October 28 the surrogate provided additional information through theU.S. Embassy in the Philippines. We did not receive that information intime to adjust our calculations for the preliminary determination. However,we will consider that information in our final determination should wecontinue to use the ``factors'' methodology. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversions</ITAG>When evaluating U.S. sales made in Hong Kong dollars, we made currencyconversions in accordance with andSection; 353.56(a)(1) of our regulations,using certified exchange rates as furnished by the Federal Reserve Bankof New York. Because we did not have certified exchange rates from theFederal Reserve Bank of New York for surrogate country data, as best informationwe used currency conversions based on monthly averages as provided by theInternational Monetary Fund. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>The petition alleged that imports of headwear from the PRC present ``criticalcircumstances.'' Under section 773(e)(1) of the Act, ``critical circumstances''exist if we determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspectthat:(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was importedknew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and (B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.Pursuant to section 773(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports. For purposes of this finding, we analyzed recent trade statistics on importlevels for headwear from the PRC for equal periods immediately precedingand following the filing of the petition. We also took into considerationseasonal factors. Based on this analysis, we find that there is a reasonablebasis to believe or suspect that imports of the subject merchandise fromthe PRC have been massive over a relatively short period of time subsequentto receipt of the petition. We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings in the United States or elsewhere of dumping of the subjectmerchandise by the PRC manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 733(e)(1)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient(See, <T3>e.g., Final Antidumping Duty Determination of Tapered Roller Bearingsand Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, From Italy </T3>(52 FR 24198,June 29, 1987)). Since the estimated margins for three of the eight tradingcompanies exceed 25 percent, as shown below, we find that the requirementsof section (e)(1)(A) are met for these companies. Therefore, the followingchart sets forth our company-specified preliminary determinations withrespect to the existence of critical circumstances for the investigatedmerchandise. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs48</C> <H1>Manufacturerer/producer/exporter</H1><H1>Critical circumstances</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">China National Light Industrial Products Import Export Corp., GuangdongBranch, Travelling Goods Co<D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">China National Light Industrial Products Import Export Corp., GuangdongStationery andamp; Sporting Goods Branch<D>No.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">China National Light Industrial Products Import/Export Corp., GuangzhouBranch Footwear and Headgear Co<D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Guangdong Arts andamp; Crafts Imports andamp; Exports Corp<D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Jiangsu Arts andamp; Crafts Imports andamp; Exports Corp<D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shanghai Arts andamp; Crafts Imports andamp; Exports Corp<D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shanghai Stationery and Sporting Goods Import/Export Corp<D>Yes.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zhejiang Arts andamp; Crafts Import andamp; Export Corp<D>  Do.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(a) of the Act, we will verify all informationused in reaching our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the UnitedStates Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of certainheadwear from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>We have preliminarily determined that criticalcircumstances exist with respect to entries of the subject merchandisefrom the following three companies: China National Light Industrial ProductsImport/Export Corporation, Guangdong Branch, Travelling Goods Company;Shanghai Stationery and Sporting Goods Import/Export Corporation; and ZhejiangArts andamp; Crafts Import andamp; Export Company; (see ``Critical Circumstances''section of this notice).
