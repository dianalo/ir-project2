Sarah Brady said in a telephone interview Tuesday that herefforts on behalf of the bill include a pitch to campaigncontributors of Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.   ``We are trying everything, everything reasonable we can thinkof'' to get the measure approved by the House Judiciary crimesubcommittee, said Sarah Brady, whose husband was shot by JohnHinckley in the 1981 attempt on President Reagan's life.   The bill would establish a national seven-day waiting period topermit local law enforcement officials to conduct background checkson handgun buyers, if they thought them necessary.   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the subcommittee's chairman and asupporter of the bill, said the measure's prospects weren't goodthis year.   ``I've been working the last month and a half trying to getvotes, and there is no bipartisan consensus,'' Hughes said.   ``Clay needs to hear from people back home that a vote for theBrady bill is the right thing to do,'' said a letter from Mrs.Brady to one of Shaw's contributors in Jacksonville.   The ``gun lobby is spending millions of dollars'' to defeat themeasure, and Shaw was under ``intense pressure'' to oppose it, shewrote.   Shaw said in an interview that he never had been lobbied thatway before. ``I thought that was kind of clever,'' he said.   Hughes said the bill has the support of five Democrats on thepanel, but is opposed by the four Republicans and Rep. HarleyStaggers, D-W.Va.   National Rifle Association lobbyist Dave Conover said the NRAopposes the bill in part because most states have considered thewaiting period question on their own, and many have rejected it.However, about one-third of the states have adopted their ownwaiting periods.   Mrs. Brady said that if a seven-day waiting period had existedin 1981, Hinckley would have been unable to buy the handgun used inthe assassination attempt from a Dallas pawn shop because it wouldhave been discovered that he lied about his address.   But Shaw said he believed a study was needed to ``see whetherthe waiting period is really going to achieve its purpose ofkeeping guns out of the hands of felons.'' Among the questions, hesaid, are whether information and record-keeping systems aresufficient to meet the demands of the bill.   James Brady officially has retained the title of Reagan's presssecretary despite his injury. His wife has also lobbied for aHouse-approved bill that would ban plastic guns and any otherfirearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors and X-raymachines.</TEXT></DOC>
