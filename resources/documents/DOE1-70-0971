Using this model, the role of the hydrodynamicinstability, which arises due to the imbalance between the flow and thelocal burning velocities, on the evolution of the flame front and thepressure history during the combustion of premixed gases in confinedchambers is investigated. It is shown that the hydrodynamic instabilityplays an important role and that accurate modeling can only be achievedif the stabilizing effect due to flame curvature is included, in theformulation. The problem is relevant to the modeling of combustion inengines, pressure rise due to confined explosion, and the analysis ofprocesses governed by flame-flow interactions. Results provide an interpretationfor phenomena associated with large scale distortion of flames and shedlight on their underlying mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
