Gold prices slipped after soaring as much as $7 a troy ounce onThursday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bidprice of $441.25 for an ounce of gold, down from $442.50 lateThursday.   Currency dealers said the dollar opened lower in New York,reaching trading levels set in overseas activity, but moved littlethe rest of the day.   Volume was light in advance of the weekend. There was moreinterest in trading in the other major currencies, which dominatedthe markets for much of the week.   Earl I. Johnson, assistant vice president with Harris Trust andSavings Bank in Chicago, said the market was waiting for twoannouncements expected next week: the British budget, to beunveiled on Tuesday, and U.S. trade figures for January, to bereleased Thursday.   The trade figures have set off wide swings in the dollar inrecent months, and Johnson said that trend may continue next week.   Traders are focusing on the British budget because the poundsurged earlier this week in response to higher interest rates andcontinued economic strength in that country.
