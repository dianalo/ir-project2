The effect ofthe so-called channeling phenomenon on the process of electron radiationin a crystal is studied. Results of the measurements of 4.5. GeV electronsradiation spectra at incident angles approximately O are given. For comparison,we have also presented the spectrum of the radiation on an amorphoustarget {sup 12}C of similar thickness. Results indicate that the low-energypart of spectra greatly surpass the amorphous spectrum with a pronouncedpeak structure, with peak widths being noticeably wider in the case ofaxial channeling than in the planar case. Spectra are measured by a No.I(Tl)total absorption detector. The experiment is performed on the Yerevanelectron synchrotron beam with small angular divergence.</TEXT></DOC>
