Robertson, a former television evangelist and current GOPhopeful, also said over the weekend that if Bush is elected, hemost likely would not challenge him in 1992 if Bush opted for asecond term.   ``It will all depend on what George Bush does as president,''Robertson said in a news conference following a rally of hissupporters. ``Basically I would support the Republican president.That would not be a wise thing _ to go against the president ofyour own party.''   But until the national convention, Robertson said he isconcentrating on his own campaign, a campaign he admits no longeris aimed at the White House but at the future.   And if he is to survive, Robertson told his supporters he mustwin his home state's upcoming caucuses.   Robertson placed third earlier this month behind Bush and KansasSen.
