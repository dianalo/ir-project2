Inc., even though its target hasagreed to a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout in an attempt to thwartDart.   Dart extended through March 9 its hostile $37 a share offer forStop andamp; Shop's 28 million outstanding shares, totaling about $1.03billion, and indicated it planned to proceed with a proxy fight toreplace Stop andamp; Shop directors later this month, spokesman JeffreyGast said Monday.   The tender offer had been scheduled to expire Monday night.   Stop andamp; Shop, a major Northeastern retailing chain, earlierMonday had announced its tentative agreement to be taken private ina leveraged buyout led by the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.,which will pay its stockholders $44 a share.   The firm will purchase at least 66 percent of Stop andamp; Shop'soutstanding Stop andamp; Shop shares. If all the outstanding stock werepurchased, the leveraged buyout would total $1.23 billion.   The company's shareholders still must approve the deal.   In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flowor the sale of its assets.   Stop andamp; Shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 Bradlees departmentstores in 12 states in the Northeast.   Under the buyout plan , which may include participation by thecompany's top executives, Stop andamp; Shop will retain its presentmanagement and remain based in Braintree, Mass.   The company's stock has risen by more than $25 a share sinceDart first announced its takeover intent in January. In New YorkStock Exchange trading on Monday, it rose another 87{ cents to$43.50 a share.   Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams, Harkness andamp; Hill in Boston,guessed that Dart was unlikely to match the $44 a share offer.   ``You've got to be able to support the debt with some level ofsafety ... and ($44) is about as much as one can reasonably affordto pay (for Stop andamp; Shop),'' Wells said.   Dart, which owns 738,200 Stop andamp; Shop shares, is best known for aseries of unsuccessful but profitable takeover attempts of majorretailers.   In its most recent bid, Dart dropped a $6 billion hostile offerfor Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. following the Octoberstock market crash.   Other Dart takeover attempts included a 1986 bid for Safeway Co.and a 1987 bid for Supermarkets General.   KKR, which took Safeway private in a leveraged buyout followingthe failed Dart bid, is one of the nation's biggest investmentpartnerships specializing i leveraged buyouts.   Last week, the firm acquired New York-based Seaman Furniture Co.for $350 million.</TEXT></DOC>
