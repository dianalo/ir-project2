Thepurpose of the program was to encourage participating universities toutilize design projects for the senior and graduate level design coursesthat would focus on topics relevant to the nation's space program. Theactivities and projects being carried out under the NASA UniversitiesAdvanced Space Design Program are excellent experiences for the participants.This program is a well-conceived, well-planned effort to achieve themaximum benefit out of not only the university design experience butalso of the subsequent summer programs. The students in the universitydesign classes have the opportunity to investigate dramatic and new concepts,which at the same time have a place in a program of national importance.This program could serve as a very useful model for the development ofuniversity interaction with other federal agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
