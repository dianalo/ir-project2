NEC Information Technologies Ltd. was accused ofconspiring with 11 other Japanese concerns to fix bids on 27contracts from 1981 through 1988, the Justice Departmentsaid. The total value of the contracts was more than $103million. U.S. prosecutors alleged that at least $30 millionof that amount resulted from bid-rigging.</LP><TEXT>   The government said the Japanese companies worked throughan organization called the Kabuto Kai to ensure that NECInformation Technologies would win most of the contracts,which the U.S. intended to be awarded competitively. Underthe arrangement, other potential contractors submitted higherbids, many of which were actually prepared by NEC InformationTechnologies, prosecutors said.   The Justice Department previously has attacked theJapanese &quot;dango&quot; system, in which companies informally agreeamong themselves which one will submit the winning bid for acontract. Dango is one of several Japanese practices thatU.S. officials says create obstacles to U.S. companies tryingto compete in Japan.   NEC Information Technologies said in a statement: &quot;It nowappears that improper communications among bidders may haveoccurred as a result of misguided efforts to satisfy U.S.procurement regulations requiring that a minimum number offirms bid for each contract. NEC Information Technologiesdoes not believe that any substantial excess costs resultedfrom these actions.&quot;   The parent, NEC Corp., said it had no knowledge of thealleged bid-rigging and didn't approve any such activities.</TEXT></DOC>
