The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it hasOK'd direct injection of genetically engineered alpha interferoninto the warts.   The FDA said a study of 192 patients showed they exhibited markedimprovement after receiving interferon injections three times a weekfor up to three weeks.   Of the 192, 42 percent experienced complete clearing of all theirtreated warts, 24 percent had a 75 percent to 99 percent reductionin the size of their treated warts and 18 percent had a 50 percentto 74 percent reduction in the size of their treated warts, the FDAsaid.   Previously, the most effective treatments were painful andpotentially scarring removal by freezing or burning.   Some types of genital warts can be treated with directapplication of conventional anti-infective drugs, but this treatmentoften is not effective.   Alpha interferon was first approved in June 1986 as a treatmentfor hairy cell leukemia _ a rare form of leukemia.   Although the presence of genital warts is more distressing thanhealth-threatening, some studies have suggested there could be arelationship in women between the warts and later development ofcervical cancer.   Adverse reactions experienced during clinical trials were mildflu-like symptoms. The drug is not recommended for use in pregnantwomen since animal studies have shown the treatment may causeabortions.   Schering Corp. of Kenilworth, N.J., will market the alphainterferon treatment under the Intron-A brand name.</TEXT></DOC>
