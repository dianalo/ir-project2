There are only two commercial reprocessingcompanies, Cogema of France and British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) of England.Up to 1987 they had not sold their reprocessing technology. However,a Cogema subsidiary signed a contract to transfer technology to Japanfor a reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from 800 tonnes of spentfuels a year. BNFL have followed this by launching their own export drive,although both countries are bound by an agreement of the Nuclear SuppliesGroup. West Germany is seen as a potential market for reprocessing technology.The United States, in particular, was anxious to stop the spread of reprocessingand plutonium. Now, however, nuclear trade is encouraged and this changein policy and the Cogema deal, threaten to undermine the principle restrainingthe export of reprocessing technology.</TEXT></DOC>
