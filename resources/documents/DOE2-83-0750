Conventional interpretation of recent dataon strange particle production in 4 GeV/c antiproton annihilations onTa has not been able to account for the high observed production of strangeness,and in particular the lambda particles. However, assuming quark gluonplasma formation at rather modest temperature Tandless;60 MeV along with a simplereaction model in which antiprotons deposit energy in the forward coneof nuclear matter within the target nucleus, the observed spectra andtotal abundances of lambdas and kaons are found to agree with theory.</TEXT></DOC>
