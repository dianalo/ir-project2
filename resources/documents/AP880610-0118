Botha todayextended the two-year nationwide state of emergency for anotheryear and tightened curbs on press coverage of opposition activity.   Anti-apartheid leaders assailed the proclamation, which willleave hundreds of prominent activists in jail without charge.   The emergency regulations allow sweeping powers of detention,outlaw many forms of peaceful anti-government protest and restrictfreedom of speech, press and assembly.   White women from the Black Sash civil rights group stood alonghighways in Johannesburg during the morning rush hour with posterssaying: ``Apartheid is the emergency.'' A multiracial crowd of 100attended a vigil for the estimated 2,500 emergency detainees atJohannesburg's Central Methodist Church.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said extension of the emergency``is a pointless and bankrupt exercise'' which ``aggravates SouthAfrica's crisis.''   The Reagan administration had only a brief comment on the latestdevelopment.   ``This action underscores the need for a dialogue between thegovernment and the black opposition to bring about a fullyfunctioning non-racial democracy,'' said White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater.   In Tokyo, the Japanese government today criticized the extentionand urged South Africa to release political prisoners, permitanti-apartheid activities and talk with the opposition.   The outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, in astatement from its headquarters in Zambia, said the governmentsought ``to ensure its survival by continuing to resort to the mostbrutal repression.''   The ANC called for comprehensive, mandatory sanctions againstSouth Africa and said its guerrillas must escalate their attacks.   Botha's announcement came two days after blacks ended theirbiggest and longest general strike against the white-controlledgovernment. Black labor federations said today that about 2,000workers who joined the protest have been fired and 1,000 moresubjected to various disciplinary actions.   The new emergency decree took effect immediately upon governmentpublication. New press restrictions will bar all media from quotingany member of an outlawed or restricted organization and requirelocal news agencies to register with the government.   These domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in theircoverage of anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to submit alltheir dispatches to a government censor before publication, theregulations say.   Journalists are already restricted in coverage of unrest,security force action, treatment of emergency detainees and a widerange of political statements the government considers subversive.   Another section gives the government power to extend thesuspenions of two anti-apartheid newspapers, New Nation and South,which were closed down in recent months. New Nation's editor,Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been detained without charge since December1986.   ``It is indeed the aspiration of the government that conditionswill change to such an extent that the declared state of emergencycan be lifted,'' Botha said in a statement.   ``We might just as well prepare ourselves for a permanent stateof emergency,'' independent member of Parliament Jan van Eck told agathering in Johannesburg on Thursday. ``A minority regime will notbe able to govern this country without the very wide and veryarbitrary powers afforded by the state of emergency.''   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no votein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Despite banning of apartheid groups and restrictions on theirleaders, more than 2 million blacks stayed away from work, schooland shops from Monday to Wednesday. The strike was called toprotest these restrictions and oppose labor legislation that couldweaken black unions.   Botha declared the nationwide emergency on June 12, 1986, aftertwo years of violence that claimed 1,700 lives.   In February, 17 anti-apartheid organizations, including thenationwide United Democratic Front coalition, were banned from allpolitical activity. The two front presidents and treasurer, thelast executive members not in hiding or in detention, were bannedfrom giving speeches or news interviews.   About 40,000 people, including 10,000 children, have beendetained during the past two years, according to the now-bannedDetainees Parents Support Committee. They estimate 2,500 people arestill in prison.   The government has refused to give definitive numbers of peoplein detention.</TEXT></DOC>
