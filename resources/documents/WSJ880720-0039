Posts a Decline of 14% For the Second Quarter </HL><AUTHOR> Julie Amparano (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AIT BLS SBC </CO><IN> TEL ERN </IN><TEXT>   Two regional Bell telecommunications concerns posted higher second-quarter earnings, bolstered primarily by strong growth of telephone access lines, while a third Bell company reported a decrease.    Earnings increased 27% for Ameritech and 3.6% for BellSouth Corp. Southwestern Bell Corp.'s profit slumped 14% despite some access-line growth, reflecting a depressed regional economy.    Ameritech   Earnings for Chicago-based Ameritech soared, aided primarily by strong growth in telephone and cellular lines and a one-time gain from the sale of Canadian cellular operations.    The company posted a $42.1 million gain from the sale of its 17% interest in Cantel, a Canadian cellular company. Business and residential telephone lines increased 2.4% to 15.2 million, up 354,000 from a year ago. Cellular-mobile lines grew 58% to more than 100,000.    Revenue rose 4.6% to $2.48 billion from $2.37 billion. In the six months, revenue increased 4.7% to $4.89 billion from $4.67 billion.    Expenses were up 4.6% in the quarter and 6.5% in the six months, primarily because of accounting changes required by the Federal Communications Commission and increases in business activity. In the quarter, Ameritech had expenses of $1.92 billion, compared with $1.83 billion a year ago. In the six-month period, expenses climbed to $3.81 billion from $3.56 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ameritech shares closed at $89.625, off 37.5 cents.    Southwestern Bell   St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell's profit fell in the quarter, as well as in the six months, reflecting earnings dilution associated with its cellular and paging operations, tough economic conditions in Texas and Oklahoma and generally higher expenses.    Revenue increased 7.8% to $2.03 billion from $1.89 billion in the quarter. For the six months, revenue rose 7.2% to $4.03 billion from $3.76 billion a year ago.    Total operating expenses increased 15% in the quarter, primarily because of costs relating to the elimination of Silver Pages operations and increased telephone company expenditures.    The company said more than 83,000 telephone access lines were added in the 1988 second quarter, compared with only 5,000 for the like period last year.    Wall Street reacted unfavorably to the company's results. Southwestern Bell closed down 50 cents at $37.625 a share in composite trading on the Big Board.    BellSouth   BellSouth, based in Atlanta, said earnings rose because of increases in new customer lines and toll usage. Revenue climbed 6.3% to $3.21 billion from $3.02 billion.    The company said it added more than 133,500 access lines in its nine-state territory, boosting the total to about 16 million. Toll usage, which is local long-distance telephone service, surged 17% to $593.1 million from $507 million.    For the six months, BellSouth's profit fell, reflecting increases in operating expenses and revenue reductions stemming from regulatory decisions. For instance, Florida regulators ordered BellSouth's Southern Bell telephone unit to defer $11 million of revenue earlier this year to reflect its lower corporate tax rates.    Revenue rose 5.8% to $6.32 billion from $5.97 billion in the six months. Meanwhile, expenses climbed 11% to $4.66 billion, up $489.5 million from a year ago. Most of the higher costs were related to acquisitions and new business consolidations.    On the Big Board, BellSouth fell 37.5 cents to close at $41 a share.    ---                  SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME                        1988               1987                     in       per       in      per     %                  millions   share   millions   share   chg.
