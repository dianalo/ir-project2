Closure of the operations, representing about 20% of theSan Franciso-based oil giant's petroleum refining capacity,wouldn't be surprising in view of weak gasoline demand andenvironmental pressures on oil companies to modify old plantsto produce cleaner burning fuels, analysts said.</LP><TEXT>   Chevron is looking at various alternatives, includingcutting the refinery's output in half, or turning it into astrictly chemicals operation producing ethylene, KeithGuidry, an Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union official,told Dow Jones international petroleum report.   Employment reductions under the more radical proposalcould amount to as many as 1,500 to 1,600 jobs, Mr. Guidrysaid. He and other union officials couldn't be reached forfurther comment.   Chevron said it met with union leaders Tuesday butdeclined to comment on options being considered for theplant. A final decision hasn't been reached, a companyspokeswoman said.   In a statement, however, Chevron said it is lookingclosely at ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency inits U.S. refining operations. &quot;It's natural that we wouldfocus on Port Arthur because it is recognized as being amongthe least efficient of our refineries.&quot;   Chevron said it faces costs of more than $2 billion overthe next five years to comply with new environmentalregulations. About half those costs are related to passage in1990 of the federal Clean Air Act, which requires cleanerburning gasolines.   For the third quarter, Chevron posted U.S. refining andmarketing losses of $10 million, as overall domestic profitfrom oil and gas production and marketing fell 87% to $19million from $148 million a year earlier. For the ninemonths, Chevron had net income of $1.25 billion, or $3.58 ashare, on revenue of $30.55 billion.   William H. Brown, III an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.,said the Port Arthur refinery has been &quot;under scrutiny&quot; sinceChevron acquired it along with Gulf Oil Corp. in 1984.Passage of the Clean Air Act was &quot;potentially the straw thatbroke the camel's back.&quot;   Any shutdown of the refinery probably would be part of along-anticipated restructuring of Chevron's refining andmarketing operations, the analyst said. Many other oilcompanies are also taking a closer look at their operationsas they trim estimates of future gasoline demand, he said.   Last year, in a move to bolster flagging refining andmarketing operations, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co.sold its Los Angeles-area refinery to Unocal Corp. And AmocoOil Corp. recently shut down a small refinery in Wyoming.   Chevron's Port Arthur refinery has a daily capacity ofabout 315,000 barrels a day, making it one of the largest inthe country. The plant's beginning dates back to 1901, acompany spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
