The Bank Board said it placed the thrift in receivership and chartered a new federal mutual savings and loan, Financial Security Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, to assume its assets and liabilities.    The Bank Board attributed the thrift's failure to rapid growth in major loan investments coupled with &quot;deficient underwriting and appraisal policies.&quot; The Bank Board said the thrift had about $156.2 million in assets. For the year ended June 30, the thrift reported a net loss of $13.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
