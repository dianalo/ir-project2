The process, which is still in the early development stage, has the potential to almost eliminate nitrogen oxides -- a major part of smog -- from sources such as diesel vehicles and coal-burning generating plants, the researchers said.    If the process should become commercially applicable, it could greatly benefit the fight against acid rain and air pollution. Sandia stressed that the concept has been investigated only in the laboratory, and requires a great deal of additional research, which it expects will be carried out by the private sector.    Sandia scientists Robert A. Perry and Dennis L. Siebers disclosed their findings in an article in the British journal Nature. Sandia, a research contractor, operates the Livermore Combustion Research Facility for the Department of Energy. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s ATandamp;T Technologies Inc. unit manages Sandia for the department on a not-for-profit basis.    The new process uses an inexpensive, nontoxic chemical to convert the nitrogen oxides into water, nitrogen, and other gases. The chemical, cyanuric acid, is commonly used currently as a stabilizer for chlorine in swimming pools.    In experiments conducted on a small diesel engine, Messrs. Perry and Siebers found that by passing the engine's exhaust over the solid cyanuric acid, they could reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 99%.    The Energy Department automatically owns the patent to any technology developed at laboratories funded by the department.
