Stolar was traveling from Israel, where he emigrated earlier thisyear after a long fight to leave the Soviet Union.   He said he had longed to return to the city he and his familyleft for the Soviet Union when he was a teen-ager, but feared itmight never happen.   ``I was an alien there for all the 58 years I was there,'' saidthe native Chicagoan. ``It was a crime they didn't let me out.''   He plans to get reacquainted with the city of his birth and totour the nation, taking in some baseball, junk food and otherall-American fare.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who helped secure Stolar's release fromthe Soviet Union, was on hand for the welcome home. He presentedStolar and his Soviet-born wife, Gita Rozovskaya, a bouquet of redroses, an American flag and a T-shirt reading, ``Chicago.''   The senator called Stolar ``a real hero, a guy who has stood upfor freedom.''   ``It is fitting Abe should return home to Chicago on the Fourthof July,'' Simon said.   Stolar, overwhelmed with emotion, searched for words to expresshis feelings.   ``What can I say, really,'' he said. ``I can't say anything butthank you, thank you, thank you!''   Stolar, whose parents immigrated from Russia in 1910, was raisedon the Northwest Side. But when he was 19, in 1931, the familyreturned to their homeland, believing the Bolshevik Revolution hadcreated a workers' paradise.   It didn't turn out that way.   Stolar's father died in the Stalinist purges, and his mother andsister were sent to camps in Siberia. Stolar was wounded by a Germanhand grenade and lost the sight in one eye.   He served in the Red Army during World War II, then worked as atranslator and announcer for Radio Moscow. But after nearly fivedecades in the Soviet Union, Stolar wanted out.   His exit proved more difficult than his entry.   Promises that he could leave were repeatedly broken by Sovietofficials, who refused to let the whole family leave the country.   After a 14-year fight, Stolar finally won freedom. In March, he,his wife, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren headed forIsrael, where they now live.   ``We feel pampered by fate after all those disgusting, wasted,stupid years,'' Stolar wrote in a recent letter to Simon. ``As somany people have said before me, what a pity it comes so late inlife.''   On visiting Chicago, he wrote, ``It will be a look at the oldtown, which will really be all new to me, that few visitors, thoughnative born, can enjoy.''   His agenda includes a baseball game at Wrigley Field, which lookspretty much the same except for the new lights that will allow himto catch Wednesday's night game between the Cubs and the San DiegoPadres.   Stolar dreamed of one day staying in the fancy, 3,000-roomStevens Hotel, a dream that will come true.   The hotel, now the Chicago Hilton and Towers, has offered theStolars its 23rd-floor Chicago Suite. Despite recent refurbishing,the grand ballroom and grand salon, glittering with mirrors and goldleaf, are virtually unchanged, said assistant manager Peter Borup.   No special menu is planned during Stolar's weeklong stay; he's``a junk-food junkie'' who likes hamburgers and hot dogs, Borup said.   Other stops on the Stolars' 12-city U.S. tour include Anchorage,Alaska, and Miami. They'll end the trip with an Aug. 13 visit to LosAngeles.   Their visit was arranged and financed by Chicago Action forSoviet Jewry.</TEXT></DOC>
