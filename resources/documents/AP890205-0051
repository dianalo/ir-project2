Bendjedid's office issued the draft constitution late Saturday,and said it will be submitted to a referendum on Feb. 23.   This North African Arab nation of 25 million people has astruggling economy dependent on oil and gas exports in an era ofsinking prices.   Bendjedid, 59, has been taking quiet steps for years to moveAlgeria away from orthodox socialism toward a free-market economy,but has faced determined resistence within the ruling party and thegovernment bureaucracy.   The process was accelerated after widespread rioting in October.Officials said 176 people died in several days of fighting.   The proposed document would supersede the 1976 constitution drawnup under Houari Boumedienne, president from 1965-78. Boumedienneestablished a Marxist system on the Soviet model, with a Politburocontrolling a ruling party that has a monopoly on political andeconomic power.   Under the new constitution, the army no longer would be given arole in ``the development of the country and the building ofsocialism.'' Its role would be restricted to defending the``national independence, the unity and territorial integrity of thecountry.''   Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic the officiallanguage of Algeria.   The new text recognizes the right to strike, within some limits,and says ``the right to create associations of a political characteris recognized,'' but does not explicitly authorize competingparties. Until now, the ruling National Liberation Front has beenthe only legal political organization.   Also dropped would be a declaration in the Article I of thecurrent constitution that ``the Algerian state is socialist.'' Thepresident's oath of office no longer would declare respect for ``theirreversible character of the choice for socialism.'' The newdocument does not even once use the word ``socialism.''   A first round of constitutional reform, eliminating the party'sdirect control over the government, was approved by 92 percent ofthe voters in a Nov. 3 referendum.   Bendjedid, running unopposed as the National Liberation Frontcandidate, was then re-elected to a third five-year term on Dec. 22.   The new constitution would guarantee the right to privateproperty and to inheritance, as well as freedoms of conscience,opinion, expression, association, assembly and intellectual creation.   A statement issued by the president's office when the text wasmade public said the new document would provide ``complete,unbreakable guarantees of the exercise of individual and collectiveliberties.''   In recent months, groups and associations have been holdingrallies, making declarations and otherwise pushing the boundaries ofwhat previously had been forbidden.   There was no public input into the new draft constitution,though. It was prepared in secret by Bendjedid's legal experts andissued Saturday night with no advance warning. At the same time, avoting date was set less than three weeks away.   One of those involved in the drafting, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said it was ``impossible to adopt reforms which rejectsocialism as a political system and simultaneously endorse socialismas a state philosophy.''   Bendjedid himself recently criticized the current constitution asa ``mixture of ideology, philosophy and law ... which must bereplaced by a state of law concerned exclusively with the relationsbetween the state and society.''</TEXT></DOC>
