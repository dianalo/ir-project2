 I've done NetworldDallas and Boston, Comdex Fall and Spring, PC Expo, Localnet, Interface, andDexpo.andP;  I've been to regional shows like Landex.andP;  I've been to federal showslike FOSE.andP;  I've been to shows that don't exist anymore.andP;  But I've never beento anything like CeBIT.andM;CeBIT, held yearly in West Germany, had more than a half million attendees.andO;To be precise, this year 560,000 people traveled to the city of Hannover tosee 4,000 exhibits of office technology from 40 countries.andP;  I wandered theimmense show grounds feeling as amazed as I did at my first trade show,Localnet East, which I attended on my first day at this magazine.andP;  I thoughtlong and hard to come up with an office technology product lacking in this10-day exhibition, but CeBIT had everything, from reprographic machines torobotic tape carousels to walk-in safes to cellular phones to satellites.andO;And it had networks.andP;  CeBIT gives a new meaning to the saying often appliedto Comdex: &quot;You don't need it if you can't find it here.&quot;andM;To put CeBIT in perspective, Comdex Fall, the biggest American computer show,had 120,000 attendees and 1,470 exhibitors in 1989.andP;  So CeBIT is over twicethe size of Comdex.andP;  Fortunately, CeBIT isn't nearly the exhausting affairthat Comdex is.andP;  This doesn't mean that the 1,900-page, five-pound show guidedidn't cause my hands as much pain as the 4,000 booths in 18 differentbuildings caused my feet.andP;  And I did spend three hours a day commuting frommy hotel located about 60 miles outside of Hannover (but the beautiful trainride through the German countryside more than compensated for the timespent).andM;CeBIT is a testament to the German people's ability to organize.andP;  Mostimportantly, the exhibitors are arranged by product type.andP;  If you areinterested in security, you don't have to launch an expedition; you headstraight to the building housing those products.andP;  CeBIT is organized into 14technology areas, among them office and information systems, banking,security, software and databases, peripherals, telecommunications, CAD/CAM,microcomputers, and research and development.andP;  Networks and training andpersonnel development were the two additions this year.andM;Also, unlike Comdex, the exhibit halls weren't scattered all over the city.andO;The Hannover Fair grounds are set up to handle huge expositions of all types.andO;Vans shuttled attendees drooping with product literature from building tobuilding.andP;  There was even a press van.andP;  I never waited an hour for a taxi or30 minutes for a soda, both common occurrences at Comdex.andM;The booths themselves were something to see.andP;  Exhibit spaces stretched on forwhat seemed like city blocks.andP;  Two-story booths were almost commonplace, butvisitors to IBM's booth reached the second floor in an elevator.andP;  GeneralElectric's booth had a waterfall.andP;  But of all the booths, Sony's was the mostimpressive.andP;  At the center was a glass-and-steel, triangular building,surrounded by a marble walkway, grass, flowers, and trees.andM;The atmosphere was more relaxed than an American trade show.andP;  Many vendorsserved food and alcohol in their booths, in hopes of keeping the attendees onthe floor as long as possible.andP;  Each exhibit hall had a snack bar, servingice cream, beer, coffee, and hot dogs.andP;  While there was a definite absence of&quot;tech tarts&quot; or the scantily clad, beautiful women who are hired to draw malebuyers into the booths, exhibitors thought nothing of using the image of anude woman to demonstrate the resolution of their monitors.andM;CeBIT was significant for more than recordbreaking crowds and huge booths(and showing networks).andP;  The 1990 show marked the first time EasternEuropeans could freely and easily see the high technology available to theWestern world.andP;  Last year, only 1.2 percent of the attendees were fromPoland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Hungary.andP;  This year, withperestroika, 5.8 percent or 4,700 people were from these countries.andP;  Of the560,000 total attendees, 4.5 percent or 25,000 people came from East Germany.andO;This is truly remarkable in light of the fact that until last December,Rumanians had to register their typewriters with the government.andP;  While thevarious Soviet bloc countries do manufacture some computers, they are lightyears behind the Western countries.andM;While exhibitors hailed from 40 foreign countries from Chile to Ireland toSingapore, the United States provided the largest foreign contingent.andO;Concentrated in the Business USA pavilion, an exhibition hall dedicated toAmerican computer makers, the United States had 312 exhibiting companies.andO;Business USA was more than just a showcase of American computer products.andO;The commerce departments of many states, including New Jersey, Kansas, andCalifornia, wooed attendees, bragging about their services and commitment tothe high-tech industries.andP;  Time was the official publication of CeBIT.andP;  TheU.S.andP;  Secretary of Commerce, Robert Mosbacher, came to Hannover to give aspeech praising the exhibition.andM;LANs at CeBITandM;While the influx of Eastern Europeans was not a planned event, the additionof networks was.andP;  A brochure called &quot;Trends In Connectivity&quot; put out byNetworld Europe likened connectivity to the common European market coming in1992.andP;  People want their different computers and software to communicateseamlessly, just as Europeans are looking toward a unified marketplace, thebrochure said.andP;  It cited a report from Logica Telematics Service that&quot;predicts a 19 percent per year increase in LAN demand for the next fiveyears and [the report] says the demand for network nodes will grow by 34percent in the same time frame.&quot;andM;According to Dataquest, the United Kingdom will lead the European LAN marketat 20.3 percent.andP;  At 18 percent and 15.3 percent, West Germany and Francewill hold the second and third spots, respectively.andP;  Italy is projected tohold 11.2 percent of the LAN market.andP;  The Netherlands will hold 6.6 percent,Spain will follow closely behind at 5.6 percent, and Sweden will hold 4.6percent.andM;So the increased interest in networks at CeBIT is no surprise.andP;  In fact, thiswas the first year that the volume of network products shown warranted itsown building.andP;  Network products were localized in the Networld Europe andMultinet halls.andP;  The Business USA and Telecommunications pavilions and theoffice automation halls had a few LAN products as well.andM;CeBIT bore witness to the fact that the Americans are more advanced when itcomes to networking.andP;  The United States accounted for about half of thenetwork exhibits.andP;  But regardless of the manufacturer's nationality, vendorsattending CeBIT were looking to win international customers.andP;  The commonEuropean market of 1992 presents American companies with a huge opportunity.andO;Companies that previously were hindered by the 12 sets of rules in 12different countries will find it much easier to do business in Europe.andM;Networld EuropeandM;Hall 23 was home to Networld Europe as well as other networking exhibits.andP;  Inits second year, the Novell-sponsored Networld Europe had 65 exhibitingcompanies showing NetWare and NetWare-compatible products.andP;  Networld Europelooked like a smaller version of the Dallas and Boston editions of Networld.andO;In Networld, as in all the other halls, it helped to speak German but Imanaged very well speaking English.andP;  The companies were housed in a redframework of booths, much the way Canadian companies are isolated at Comdex.andO;Nearly 40 of the Networld exhibitors were from the United States, and 15 werefrom West Germany.andP;  Other exhibitors hailed from Switzerland, theNetherlands, Taiwan, England, and Canada.andM;While I expected to see American companies with European offices such asNovell, Proteon, and SynOptics, I was surprised to see some smallercompanies, such as Fresh Technology and Aquila Communications.andP;  Some U.S.andO;companies that did not produce competing products shared an exhibit space,thereby reducing exhibit costs by a half or a third.andP;  Many Americanmanufacturers were represented by their distributors, usually either Americanor German.andM;Hardware dominated the product selection, mostly interface cards, disklessPCs, and file servers.andP;  Backup units, hard drives, and other platformproducts abounded.andP;  A few vendors of utility software, such as printersharing software, appeared.andP;  Even electronic mail had only a few vendors.andO;ABM's Platinum accounting software was the lone application software product.andM;As the sponsor, Novell quite naturally occupied the largest space at NetworldEurope.andP;  The main attraction was its demonstration of 250 PCs, PS/2s, andMacintoshes running NetWare 386.andP;  While Novell has brought this demonstrationfrom show to show, hearing the presentation in German as well as English wasa new twist.andP;  Of particular interest to the international crowd would beNovell's X.400/MHS gateway.andP;  Novell demonstrated a prototype MHS/X.400gateway, which it is developing with British Telecom.andP;  It had a hands-on demothat allowed attendees to send a message to other PCs in the Novell boothusing X.400.andM;Much of the news revolved around hardware.andP;  IMC announced a NetWare 386driver for its 16-bit Ethernet cards, called PCnic and PCnic II.andP;  Both AquilaCommunications and Tiara announced Ethernet cards for use with 10Base-T whenit becomes a standard.andP;  Proteon showed a 4/16Mbps Token Ring card for theEISA bus.andP;  Standard Microsystems recruited for Arcnetplus, the up-and-coming20Mbps quasi-Arcnet, now that Datapoint is delivering the development kits.andO;Morton Management was showing its new 486, 25MHz file server and its 1GB diskdrive.andP;  Pure Data was the only vendor of fax servers.andM;Some American manufacturers were represented by their distributors.andP;  TheGerman office of Softsel, DNS Softsel, was also showing its product lines.andO;Connectica, a distributor with offices in the United States, Germany, andEngland, was showing off the products it distributes.andP;  It was throughConnectica that cc:Mail got the word out on its German language version ofits e-mail.andP;  cc:Mail will ship the German version in the second quarter, andit's working on French and Italian versions, the company says.andM;While IBM, 3Com, and Novell were present themselves, Banyan was the onlymajor American network operating system company that chose to be representedexclusively through European resellers, specifically Asonic ComputerEquipment and Telemation GmBH.andP;  Banyan demonstrated the first multilingualversion of Vines, which is slated to ship in the third quarter.andP;  This versionof Vines is designed to support German-, French-, and English-speaking userson the same server.andP;  Banyan says this version of its software cansimultaneously support up to 100 different languages.andP;  Support for severallanguages allows a network administrator to use commands in his own languagewhile supporting international users, for example.andM;More in Hall 23andM;Not all exhibitors in Hall 23 were part of Networld Europe.andP;  A fewcompanies--notably, SynOptics and Vitalink--had booths apart from theNetworld framework.andP;  (SynOptics covered all grounds by having a booth inNetworld Europe.)andP;  3Com, a rare sight at trade shows, had a sizable booth anddebuted internetwork bridges.andP;  SynOptics showed the new Token Ring capabilityof its Lattisnet wiring system.andP;  And several German hardware manufacturershad exhibits.andM;Of the German companies, Schneider andamp; Koch (Sandamp;K) had the widest variety ofproducts.andP;  On the hardware level, Sandamp;K offers customers Ethernet and wasshowing prototype FDDI cards.andP;  As for connectivity, it has bridges, X.25, andSNA hardware.andP;  It also resells both NetWare and LAN Manager (Sandamp;K was one ofthe few places I saw Microsoft's network operating system in the show).andM;Sandamp;K set up an elaborate network to demonstrate the products it sells andresells.andP;  The network had an FDDI backbone with Ethernet subnetworks.andO;Various workstations and servers were running TCP/IP, UNIX, NetWare, and LANManager.andP;  PCs ran Sandamp;K's Reflection terminal emulation software.andM;Richard Hirshmann, a German company with a U.S.andP;  office, showed its Ethernetline, with products for shielded and unshielded twisted pair, coax, thincoax, broadband, and fiber, as well as its network management system.andM;Fisher Electronic showed its Arcnet and Ethernet hardware.andP;  Fishernet is thecompany's NetBIOS-compatible network operating system.andP;  Included in Fishernetare electronic mail and a number of smaller utilities for chatting,broadcasting, and monitoring users.andM;OSI DemonstrationandM;Also in Hall 23 and adjacent to the Networld Europe exhibit was CeBIT'slargest demonstration of OSI to date.andP;  And 1990 marked the first publicdemonstration of X.500 interoperability, a future OSI standard for directoryservices that is still in a state of flux.andM;The network market in general and the European Community share a common goal,one of unity and transparent operation.andP;  The OSI protocols will play a majorrole in the creation of large internetworks of heterogeneous computers sinceall European network products will have to conform to the EC directive 87/95.andO;This directive mandates that all companies intending to spend more than100,000 European Currency Units on a network should conform to a Europeanstandard, or failing that, an international standard.andP;  So as support for OSIis driven by GOSIP in the United States, support for OSI is driven by the ECin Europe.andM;Like a single European currency and a single set of trade rules, a singlecommunications protocol is essential.andP;  The cacophony of network protocols canbe quieted down by OSI, as CeBIT showed.andP;  The transparent interoperation ofdifferent systems in different locations is a lofty goal, and one that won'tbe achieved easily.andP;  While the OSI protocol stack alone won't achieve thesegoals, it is a means to the end.andP;  Interoperability won't be achieved by usingthese protocols interactively, as one can use TCP/IP's FTP to transfer files.andO;These protocols must be integrated into large applications.andM;The CeBIT OSI demonstration gave one a concrete feeling of how theupper-layer OSI protocols can be incorporated into useful applications, evenif the reality is some years away.andM;Twenty-nine vendors, nine users, and several industry associations assembledfour examples of OSI at work.andP;  The demonstration was put together by OSITOP,a user group association, and OSIone, an association of several countries'OSI groups, including EurOSInet in Europe, Intapnet in Japan, OSIcom inAustralia, OSInet in the United States, and OSnet in Singapore.andM;Specifically, four model applications were shown: consortium, banking,manufacturing, and office productivity.andP;  The participants built modelapplications to demonstrate how OSI could be instrumental in globalapplications involving numerous companies and sites.andP;  Computer vendors playedthe roles of real-world suppliers, vendors, and financial institutions.andM;The office productivity model was the simplest of the four because itinvolved only X.400, the OSI's standard for electronic messaging.andP;  In thismodel, Electricite de France, a French power generating company, andIberduero, a Spanish power generating company, wanted to obtain andconsolidate documents from their respective power stations.andP;  The head officesrequested information from the power stations using an X.400 messagingsystem.andP;  The requested performance reports were sent to the head office inOffice Document Architecture (ODA, another OSI application-layer standard)format.andP;  At the head office, these documents were consolidated and madeavailable in a report form for viewing, printing, or distribution.andM;Ford Europe served as the example for the manufacturing model.andP;  This modeldescribed the daily interchange of information between a manufacturing headoffice and its production plants and suppliers.andP;  The head office of Ford usedFile Transfer, Access, and Maintenance (FTAM) to deliver a car productionschedule to its factory.andP;  The head office also used FTAM to retrieveinformation about the factory's stock levels.andP;  Based on the amount of stock,the head office could request supplies from its suppliers of paint andplastics, Azo and Hoechst, using an EDIFACT purchase order sent using X.400.andO;(EDIFACT is a lengthy acronym for Electronic Document Interchange ForAdministration, Commerce, and Transport.andP;  It provides a standard syntax thatallows international trade partners to define the format and structure oftheir documents, such as purchase orders and invoices.)andP;  The suppliers usedEDIFACT to send invoices to the head office.andP;  Ford's headquarters usedEDIFACT to send the payment order to the bank.andP;  The suppliers use X.400 tosend delivery information to the factory.andM;Like the manufacturing model, the banking model showed FTAM and X.400 inaction.andP;  The banking model showed how EDIFACT can be used to transfer fundsto and from clients and between banks.andP;  Banque Nationale de Paris andDresdner Bank were the imaginary financial institutions.andP;  The bank received apayment order from a client via X.400.andP;  If the client and the supplier usedthe same bank, the debit advice was sent in an EDIFACT message.andP;  If they useddifferent banks, the credit advice was sent using FTAM.andM;The consortium model was the most complex of the four because it involved thelargest number of companies.andP;  A group of chemical companies responded to apower generation company with a joint offer to supply chemicals.andP;  Thechemical companies, in this case Akzo, Exxon, Hoechst, and Solvay, respondedto the Spanish power company, Iberduero, put their joint proposal in an ODAformat and sent it via X.400.andP;  Then the chemical companies used FTAM tosupply price lists for chemicals.andP;  Iberduero used EDIFACT and X.400 to raisepurchase orders and receive return invoices.andP;  Payment was made through anEDIFACT order to the bank.andM;The OSI demonstration was the most futuristic of the network demonstrationsat CeBIT.andP;  But it was quite impressive.andP;  The vendors of competitive productsput aside their goals to sell host computers to solve their (albeitimaginary) customers' problems.andP;  For example, in the consortium model, theparticipants were Digital, IBM, ICL, and Siemens.andP;  Bull and Unisys gottogether to do the banking model.andP;  Data General, NCR, Retix, and Wang actedas the head offices in the manufacturing model, while Nixdorf and Olivettimasqueraded as the factories and HP, OSIware, Prime, and Scion served as thesuppliers for this model.andP;  The cooperation of competitors is essential to thesuccess of OSI.andM;MultinetandM;Now in its third year, Multinet was contained in a small rotunda, andcompared to the rest of the bustling show, was quiet.andP;  There were no printersscreeching; there were no loud demos.andP;  A big cafe in the center of the hallprovided plenty of chairs for attendees while they discussed their networkingneeds with the vendors.andM;The main objective of Multinet is the joint presentation of internationalcommunications standards with products currently available.andP;  It iscoordinated by an association of vendors that has no products to sell.andO;Multinet has the unusual requirement that vendors exhibit only products theyare already shipping.andP;  (Where would American trade shows be without&quot;technology demonstrations&quot; and other forms of vaporware and slideware?)andM;This year, the status of current technology focused on the coexistence andmigration from TCP/IP to OSI, network management, network applications, andnew network technologies.andP;  The 25 participating vendors, about half Americanand half German, stressed the current state of technology in an elaboratedemonstration network.andP;  The network consisted of an FDDI backbone with TokenRing and Ethernet subnetworks.andP;  A number of vendors connected to both theFDDI backbone and the Ethernet subnetwork, including Emulex, AMD, NetworkSystems, Telemation, Prime, HP, Ascom Hasler, Synelec, and MDS.andP;  TheFDDI-only demonstrators included Fibronics and Schneider andamp; Koch.andP;  A fewconnected only to the Ethernet, including Telekom Deutsche Bundespost,Cabletron, IBM, SEL, Apple, and Mannesmann Kienzle.andP;  Token Ring participantsincluded IBM, Synelec, Spider, and Ascom Hasler.andM;The computers on the Multinet demo network ranged from GEI Tracesupercomputers to IBM 9370 mainframes to a slew of minicomputers from DEC,HP, and others to Apple Macs.andP;  Whether they used X.25, TCP/IP or some othermethod, the emphasis was on the communication and management of thesedifferent systems.andM;In the EndandM;Although the single market of Europe is three years away and the role of theEastern bloc countries is up in the air, the promise of internationalcustomers was very much on the minds of the Americans at CeBIT.andP;  Giventechnologies such as local and wide area networks, geographical barriersbecome less important.andP;  And once the communication blocks have been removed,products can be made and services can be rendered.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
