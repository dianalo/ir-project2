Diagnostic possibilities are especially defined for intervertebraldisk prolapses. In compliance with the data in the literature, the significanceis emphasized of CT which should become a prevalent radiodiagnostic methodfor the vertebrogenic lumboischiadic syndrome, especially in view ofits high sensitivity. Wherever available, CT scanning should be a satisfactoryindication for surgical or conservative therapy. However, CT scanningis not commonly available and thus, perimyelography (PMG) remains themethod of choice. Nevertheless, CT scanning is necessary should surgerybe considered, in all cases where PMG is disadvantageous or contraindicated,or where its results are not unambiguous.
