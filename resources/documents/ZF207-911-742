(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Low-Speed Page Printers Target Office and Desk Top User MarketsandM;Low-speed page printers have become staples of the workaday world.andP;  Foryears, these devices--which we define as printers that compose one page at atime in memory and print as many as 8 pages per minute (ppm)--have beenshared by small and large groups of business users who need to generatehigh-resolution hardcopy efficiently and at an affordable price.andM;Now low-speed page printers are on the threshold of moving out of hallways,closets and utility rooms and onto individual desk tops.andP;  In September,Hewlett-Packard and Canon both introduced low-cost, four-ppm laser printers(HP beat Canon to the punch by one day).andP;  HP's LaserJet IIP, priced at$1,495, and Canon's $1,545 LBP-4 may usher in the era of the personal laserprinter.andP;  The devices will certainly bring laser quality only serialtechnologies such as dot matrix printers.andM;There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of low-speed pageprinters that support either PostScript, the page description language fromAdobe Systems of Mountain View, Calif., or PostScript-compatible pagedescription languages.andP;  After just three years on the market, the number ofPostScript-compatible low-speed offerings now equal the number ofnon-PostScript devices, and many page printers are available in bothPostScript and non-PostScript versions.andM;According to Naomi Luft Cameron, associate director of research for Bis CapInternational, a market research company in Waltham, Mass., anothersignificant trend is that many low-speed page printer vendors are adopting amodular approach.andP;  Buyers can begin with a basic printer and then later, asneeds change, add features such as a PostScript cartridge, extra paper traysand additional printer memory.andM;Market analysts say the low-speed page printer market has become veryprice-conscious, as evidenced by the new Canon and HP offerings.andP;  But pricesfor DEC-compatible page printers that were available last year have remainedfairly stable.andP;  In some cases--including DEC's LN03 and LN03 Plus--priceshave even risen slightly.andM;Still, for buyers who've been waiting to take the page printer plunge, nowmay be the time.andP;  Low-speed page printers aren't exactly commodity itemsyet--it pays to compare carefully--but in terms of both price and features,low-speed page printers offer more than ever.andM;ENTER PERSONAL PRINTERSandM;Low-speed page printers are usually purchased for word processing andbusiness software applications.andP;  Such applications can be found in a varietyof business, industrial, educational and administrative environments.andP;  &quot;The[low-speed printer] makret includes very large companies that have hugeinstallations, as well as a lot of small businesses,&quot; Bis Cap's Cameron said.andO;&quot;It really falls across the board.&quot;andM;Until HP's and Canon's recent product introductions, page printers were tooexpensive to be purchased for individual users.andP;  But analyst consider the newfour-ppm page printers to be trendsetters, and expect other vendors to offersimilar printers soon.andP;  Okidata and QMS have alread indicated they mightoffer low-cost four-ppm printers.andM;The LaserJet IIP is HP's cheapest page printer, a distinction formerly heldby the HP LaserJet Series II, an eight-ppm printer priced at $2,695.andO;According to Jeri Peterson, HP's public relations coordinator for businessoffice printers, the LaserJet IIP is targeted at buyers reluctant to investin a page printer, as well as users who now share a printer and would like anoutput device of their own.andM;Why would anyone want his own printer?andP;  Simple: Sharing a printer often meansqueuing up for printer time, an inconvenient situation at best.andP;  (Seeing theJOB PENDING message grows old very quickly.)andP;  Printers shared by a largedepartment or an entire company are also more prone to breakdowns because ofheavy usage than printers used by an individual or a small work group.andM;Canon and HP perceived a significant gap between the price of dot matrixprinters--which range approximately from $500 to $1,545--and low-end pageprinters, which rarely sell for less than $2,500.andP;  As HP's Petersoneexplained, &quot;We felt there was an opportunity to come in at about $1,500 at aslower speed [than other page printers].&quot;andM;Canon's LBP-4 and HP's LaserJet IIP use the same Canon engine, the P-110.andO;Because paper travels only through the front of the P-110, the engine is lesscomplex and thus less expensive to manufacture.andP;  That translates into lowerlist prices.andM;FOUR PPM: CANON AND HPandM;In addition to their engine types, the Canon LBP-4 and HP LaserJet IIP aresimilar in one other important regard.andP;  Both printers are small enough to fiton a typical desktop corner, vendors said.andP;  The LaserJet IIP weighs 25 poundsand measures 8 by 16 by 13.5 inches, and the LBP-4 weighs in at 23 pounds andhas 7.7-by-13.4-by-15.9-inch dimensions.andP;  The LaserJet IIP's foldout papertray adds nine inches to its depth.andM;The LaserJet IIP is compatible with HP's MasterType font library and can useany LaserJet font cartridge.andP;  According to Mike Lough, an HP spokesman, theIIP's standard version includes 14 internal fonts.andP;  For $99, LaserJet IIPbuyers can get a Great Start cartridge, which contains a variety of &quot;fixedpitch and proportional fonts for spreadsheet and general word processingprinting,&quot; Lough said.andM;Canon's LBP-4, by contrast, includes four internal fonts as well as twointernal card slots that can accommodate optional credit-card-sized fontcards.andP;  Each card can support from eight to 22 additional fonts and rangesfrom $245 to $295.andP;  Joanne Tartaglia, a Canon technical supportrepresentative, said the fond cards are available from Canon dealers.andM;According to Tartaglia, the LBP-4 fonts are scalable, allowing users tochange the point size of words or letters.andP;  &quot;Usually, bit-mapped fonts arefixed in size and you can't scale them in points.&quot;andP;  HP's Lough said scalablefonts are available as an option with the LaserJet IIP.andM;At present, neither HP's LaserJet IIP nor Canon's LBP-4 support PostScript.andO;However, both vendors plan to offer PostScript options for their four-ppmprinters in the near future.andM;According to Kari Shirlaw, a Canon product support representative, CanonLBP-4 users will be able to purchase an optional PostScript card during thefirst quarter of next year.andP;  The manufacturer has yet to determine thePostScript card's price, Shirlaw said.andM;Similarly, Hewlett-Packard expects to deliver a PostScript cartridge for theLaserJet IIP early next year.andP;  According to Lough, HP recently introduced anoptional $995 PostScript cartridge for the LaserJet IID, an eight-ppm devicewith duplex printing capabilities.andP;  In conjunction with QMS, HP also offersthe QMS JetScript accessory kit, a PostScript board for the LaserJet SeriesII, for $2,795.andM;Athough the LaserJet IIP and LBP-4 have fairly close list prices, marketanalysts said it will be tough for Canon and other vendors to beat HP'sability to discount printers due to large sales volumes and its practice ofselling directly to dealers.andP;  HP's Peterson said buyers can obtain a LaserJetIIP for much less than its $1,495 list price.andM;&quot;HP's products tend to get discounted very heavily,&quot; said Angele Boyd,manager of the printer research group at International Data Corp. (IDC), amarket research company based in Framingham, Mass.andP;  Noting that the eight-ppmLaserJet Series II, list-priced at $2,695, actually sells for about $1,500,Boyd predicted that the LaserJet IIP's &quot;street price&quot; may be less than$1,000.andM;Even if competing vendors drop printer list prices below the LaserJet IIP's,she said, it will be hard to beat HP's actual selling price.andP;  &quot;Unless you'rea vendor filling incredible volume, it will be very difficult to get thatstreet price down,&quot; Boyd said.andM;Steve Tyson, Canon's marketing manager, acknowledged that &quot;traditionally, ourprinters are not as widely distributed as [Hewlett-Packard's], so our[profit] margins tend to be a little bit higher.&quot;andM;Unable to challenge HP's low prices, competitors like Canon and QMS mayinstead beef up their low-end products with additional features, marketanalysts predicted.andM;For instance, QMS' executive vice president of products and technology, DonParker, indicated that QMS might incorporate Canon's four-ppm P-110 engine ina future product.andP;  To distinguish that product from HP's LaserJet IIP, Parkersaid, QMS will produce &quot;something more fully featured with multiplelanguages.&quot;andM;Market analysts expect other third-party vendors to develop inexpensivelow-speed printers.andP;  Well before the Canon and HP four-ppm printerintroductions, several vendors had already announced relatively low-costfive- and six-ppm printers.andM;In August, Epson introduced the EPL-6000, a six-ppm printer with a price of$1,899 and, according to Bis Cap International's Cameron, &quot;a pretty good[Tokyo Electric laser] engine.&quot;andP;  During the same month, Cameron said, Toshibadebuted a $1,899 six-ppm printer, the PageLaser6/TN-7100.andM;Fujitsu and Rosetta offer the only DEC-compatible five-ppm printers.andO;Fujitsu's RX7100 uses an LED array engine and sells for $2,150, and theRX7100PS supports HP-PCL and PostScript, but for a price: $4,495.andP;  Rosetta's$2,550 RT3105D offers PostScript for less, and its $4,995 RT3105/PS offersboth PostScript and HP-PCL support.andM;DEC PRINTERS STILL POPULARandM;Despite the increasing presence of low-cost, low-speed page printers, manybuyers prefer to purchase printers straight from DEC, according to marketanalysts.andP;  Some analysts report that DEC's eight-ppm LN03 and LN03 Pluscontinue to be popular printer choices, with third-party printers thatemulate an LN03 placing a close second.andM;IDC's Boyd recommends purchasing printers that emulate either DEC's LN03 orTektronix devices if users are running &quot;very DEC-specific applications.&quot;andO;Because many applications support HP's LaserJet printers, she added, she alsoconsiders printers with HP emulations to be safe alternatives.andM;Some third-party printer vendors maintained that LN03 emulation isn't at allnecessary.andP;  According to Patsy Campbell, director of marketing services forTalaris, many software applications include drivers for non-DEC printers thatdon't offer LN03 emulation.andM;&quot;Lots of our customers use Mass-11, Word-11, or WordPerfect,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;They all run on DEC VAXes and have drivers for our [non-LN03] eight-ppmprinters.&quot;andM;Althought Talaris' low-speed page printers don't emulate DEC's LN03, Talarisconsiders the printers DEC-compatible, Campbell said.andP;  &quot;We say we'reDEC-compatible because there are more than 20 applications packages that arewell-used in the DEC market that have drivers for our printers,&quot; sheexplained.andP;  Campbell added that Talaris' mid- to high-speed printers includeLN03 emulation.andM;QMS' Parker predicted that more vendors will include LN03 emulation in theirnew low-speed products.andP;  But he added that LN03 emulation will be lessimportant to buyers--and to third-party vendors--than support for PostScriptas the Adobe page description language becomes a standard in the DEC market.andO;At present, only one QMS printer, the SmartWriter 150, offers LN03 emulation.andO;At 16 ppm, the SmartWriter 150 falls into the mid-speed category.andM;For LN03- and non-LN03-emulating printers alike, market analysts expect buyerdemand to continue increasing for the foreseeable future and anticipate theintroduction of many more low-speed offerings, especially in thepersonal-printer category.andM;Whether buyers will be wooed by slower, individual desktop page printersremains to be seen.andP;  But Charles LeCompte, editor of Bis Cap International'sPrintout newsletter, pointed out that &quot;at some point it becomes cheaper tobuy one faster printer instead of three smaller ones.&quot;andM;For many low-speed printer buyers, the choice may boil down to conveniencevs.andP;  the economy of providing oen printer for a large work group.andM;But what matters most, for the present, is that office users who once said&quot;matrix&quot; when requesting personal printers may now be able to say &quot;laser.&quot;andO;The age of the low-cost desktop page printer may finally be here.andM;BUYER'S TIPSandM;1 Make sure the printer can accept and print files generated by theapplications you use.andM;2 Decide whether you need printers that small groups of users will share, ordesktop printers for the convenience of individual users.andM;3 If price is your only motivation for selecting a four-ppm printer, rememberthat buying 50 of them will cost more than buying four higher-cost eight-ppmprinters for the same group of users.andM;4 If you plan on printing labels, transparencies or envelopes, select aprinter that includes either a manual feed option or adjustable paper guidesthat feed irregular paper automatically.andM;5 To keep paper expenses down, consider printers that offer a duplex(two-sided) printing option.andP;  The money saved on paper may more than offsetthe extra cost of the duplex feature.andM;6 If your word processing software supports a dual-paper option, you may wantto select a printer that provides two paper trays, allowing users to includetwo paper stocks in one document.andM;Postscript and Color:andM;More for More MoneyandM;Buyers looking for low-speed printers that support PostScript or color outputcan expect to pay--and get--more than other printer buyers.andM;Prices for PostScrip printers range from $1,000 to $3,000 more than pricesfor non-PostScript printers, according to Charles LeCompte, editor ofPrintout, a newsletter published by Waltham, Mass.-based market researchcompany Bis Cap International.andM;Fujitsu's five-page-per-minute (ppm) RX7100, for example, is priced at$2,150, whereas the company's PostScrip-compatible RX7100PS retails for$4,495, a difference of $2,345.andM;PostScript printers' high prices don't stop most buyers, according tovendors.andP;  &quot;Users want PostScript printers because the language supports arich, complete set of graphics and high-quality fonts,&quot; said Don Parker,executive vice president of products and technology at QMS.andP;  &quot;When you wantto do full desktop publishing, PostScript is the language of choice.&quot;andM;As more software vendors have invested in applications for the PostScriptdriver, the popularity of PostScript printers has grown.andP;  &quot;Applicationvendors have made a strong commercial statement on the value of PostScript,&quot;Parker said.andP;  &quot;They put more emphasis on PostScript drivers than on any other[drivers].&quot;andM;Slightly lower-cost alternatives are available.andP;  Some printers supportPostScript &quot;clones&quot; rather than the official PostScript from Adobe Systems ofMountain View, Calif.andP;  That difference, Parker said, &quot;forces [the vendors] tosell for a little less.&quot;andM;Although many vendors and analysts argue that the clone-compatible devicesare as good as true PostScript printers, others warn that users may encountercompatibility or quality problems.andP;  (See &quot;PostScript Compatibles Bring Speed,Sophistication to PostScript File Output,&quot; Digital Review, Aug. 28, page 37.)andM;Like PostScript, color capabilities hike printer prices significantly.andO;Market analysts maintain that color printer prices will have to drop beforethe devices will catch on in the DEC-compatible market.andP;  According to BisCap's LeCompte, &quot;most people don't need color that badly and won't pay$10,000 to get it.&quot;andM;Price relief may be in sight, however.andP;  Market analysts said QMS' ColorScript 100 Model 10, priced at $9,995, is breaking color price barriers andcould help color printers gain greater market share.andP;  &quot;Maybe that will push[color] over the edge,&quot; said LeCompte.andM;According to QMS' Parker, the company's color printers have sold primarily tographic arts and design professionals.andP;  The Color Script 100's lower price,however, has attracted corporate users who want to prepare presentationgraphics and overheads or generate color graphical summaries for internalreports.andP;  &quot;A lot of corporate use is turning up as we bring down the price,&quot;he said.andM;Howtek's Pixelmaster is breaking price barriers as well.andP;  According to EdMarino, Howtek's vice president of sales and marketing, the $6,995Pixelmaster employs a drop-on-demand inkjet technology that prints a page intwo minutes.andP;  The printer has 32 jets that simultaneously pulse ink, drawnfrom a stroage reservoir, onto paper.andM;Also unlike other inkjet printers--most of which aren't page printers--thePixelmaster doesn't require clay-coated paper.andP;  The device usespolymer-plastic-based ink that allows it to print on any type of paper.andM;LeCompte and other market analyst said the growing presence of color copiersin the business world may also spur color printer sales.andP;  Without colorcopiers, LeCompte said, users can't quickly duplicate their coloroutput--photocopiers churn out copies much faster than notoriously slow colorprinters.andP;  &quot;There is a big growth in color copiers,&quot; LeCompte explained, &quot;andperhaps the color printer market will follow in its footsteps.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
