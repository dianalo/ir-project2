Reports conflicted, however, on how much food, fuel and buildingsupplies were reaching the Armenian republic.   ``Our drivers are striking and demanding guarantees of theirsafety'' in response to gunfire and stoning attacks on severaltrains Saturday night in Armenia, said Azerbaijani activist ShahinGadzhiev.   Gadzhiev identified himself as a spokesman for the AzerbaijaniPeople's Front. Other members of the People's Front denied thattrain traffic had been halted.   ``The trains are running, but the attacks on them are alsocontinuing,'' Adel Mamedov said in a telephone interview from theAzerbaijani capital of Baku.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported late Sunday that37 trains had been dispatched from Azerbaijan to Armenia over thepast day and a half, but it said ``extremist forces are stillhindering the normal functioning of the route.''   About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reportedidled on main lines in the southwestern region of the Soviet Union.   The Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on strikes insuch key sectors as transport and energy Tuesday after PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev warned that stoppages could ruin the economyand lead to anarchy.   It also ordered the ministries of defense and interior torestore rail traffic between the two feuding Caucasus republics.Troops moved in to protect the trains, and Soviet media said Fridaythe two-month blockade that crippled Armenia was over.   But the measures failed to quell the prolonged ethnic feudingover Nagorno-Karabakh, the fertile region claimed by both Armeniaand Azerbaijan.   The Christian Armenian enclave has been part of Moslem-dominatedAzerbaijan since 1923.   Nineteen months of unrest over Nagorno-Karabakh has left 117dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes and apartmentsdestroyed, Tass said.   In the disputed region, five people were wounded in clashesSaturday and an epidemic of viral hepatitis threatened thepopulation, Tass reported Sunday.   ``Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict withdark malice and suppresses their reason,'' the official news agencysaid, noting that reports from the region increasingly resembledispatches from war zones.   Airlifts ``are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' inNagorno-Karabakh, which has a predominantly Armenian population ofabout 160,000, Tass said.   It said a highway bridge on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh'scapital, Stepanakert, was blown up early Saturday, cutting offadditional areas.   Ungathered grape crops are rotting in the field, armed attacksagainst villages continue and ambulances cannot respond to callsbecause they have no gas, Tass said.   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said Sunday that Armenia wasstill hit by food and fuel shortages, although they were not assevere as in Nagorno-Karabakh.   He said the few shipments that made it through Azerbaijan toArmenia were sabotaged. They either contained damaged materials orcisterns filled with water instead of fuel.   ``Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in a telephoneinterview from the Armenian capital of Yerevan. ``That the blockadewas stopped at all is a myth.''   Interior Ministry officials and reporters for state-run media inArmenia and Azerbaijan were unavailable Sunday for comment on theblockade.   About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs throughAzerbaijan. The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually haltedreconstruction work on Armenian areas destroyed by the massiveearthquake last December that left 25,000 dead.   Gadzhiev, whose People's Front is demanding Azerbaijani controlof Nagorno-Karabakh, accused Armenians of attempting to imposetheir own blockades on Azerbaijan.   He said Saturday's bridge explosion in Nagorno-Karabakh wasaimed at the Azerbaijani village nearby. The power supply to partof Azerbaijan also has been interrupted by Nagorno-Karabakh'sunrest, Gadzhiev said from Baku.</TEXT></DOC>
