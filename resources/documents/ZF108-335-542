 As aresults, executives have little or no idea how much IS contributes to thecompany's earnings and to overall business objectives.andM;To resolve this issue, leading companies are establishing a comprehensive IScosting system.andP;  At a basic level, costing lets management know exactly whatexpenses are incurred to produce each &quot;widget&quot; or final product.andM;In more advanced implementations, such systems provide information based onKey Business Indicators (KBIs), which are closely aligned with theenterpris's business, such as number of oil leases, insurance claimsprocessed, etc.andP;  The measurement is not the natural unit of IS production,such as payroll checks or reports produced.andM;Through the use of costing models based on KBIs, an organization can becomemore clearly aligned with corporate business objectives.andP;  By deliveringinformation on the cost of each IS service, costing enables management tomake better decisions.andP;  Executives can align the data storage or computerusage needs according to the expenses associated with producing the product.andM;As part of this approach, companies are also employing chargeback proceduresto charge corporate clients based on a predetermined price for servicesperformed.andP;  While the prices set by this process sometimes do not reflect thetrue cost for services, they do determine a defined standard.andM;Obviously, this costing approach sometimes uncovers unexpected discrepanciesregarding how expenses have been assigned and allocated.andP;  These issues are sosensitive and complex that the highest level of management has to be involvedin structuring costing methods.andM;Credibility GapandM;The reason for establishing complicated costing arrangements is to improvecommunications and delivery of IS services.andP;  Often, from an executive'sviewpoint, IS has promised the moon regarding productivity improvements, butmisses deadlines and constantly requests more money.andM;When IS projects are delivered months, and sometimes years, behind schedule,either IS overstated its capabilities or users did not clearly define theirneeds.andP;  As a result, final costs have been known to be as much as 800% overbudget.andM;Automating Just To Automate?andM;This poor performance is the reason many executives are questioning the realvalue they receive for their substantial IS investment.andP;  Although theybelieve in IS, they are not sure if they are investing wisely or automatingjust to be in the automation game.andM;Something is clearly wrong with this picture.andP;  To clear the air, a solutionmust be developed by both corporate and IS management to improvecommunications and understanding.andM;Correctly aligning IS expenses can sometimes be a painful process, but itdoes deliver clear results.andP;  In one case, a company first projected a $16million investment in a major systems application.andP;  When the chargebacksystem revealed that the implementation would really cost $74 million, thecompany was able to reorient its entire applications priorities.andM;Because costing can uncover hidden expense factors, it can deliver data onthe true and total price of information services and assist in measuring thetotal cost effectiveness of IS applications.andP;  What is more, costing caninstall strong controls over the use of systems and identify marginal systemsapplications.andM;Executive InvolvementandM;To obtain these advantages through costing, decision makers need to bestrongly committed to obtaining dependependable financial information aboutIS expenses.andP;  Without this executive involvement, costing and chargebackcannot work.andP;  Top corporate leaders must provide the support needed to ensurean effective systems implementation and to initiate proactive change in theenterprise.andM;A good example of how management participation makes a difference is evidentat Carolina Power andamp; Light, based in Raleigh, N.C.andP;  There, the costing processshowed that fossil fuel power plants were actually subsidizing the price ofIS for the nuclear plants.andP;  Instead of laying blame, management used thisvital information to establish a chargeback system ensuring properallocations.andM;Management's role is vital in other areas.andP;  Decision makers should ensurethat other levels of the enterprise are committed to the effort.andP;  They shouldsolicit a costing implementation team to include representatives fromaccounting, the corporate staff and the user community.andM;The process of costing and chargeback is a closed loop managementcommunication process and not just another reporting method.andP;  Data should bedelivered continually to management.andM;Not a PanaceaandM;It is wrong to expect a costing mechanism to cure all of IS' problems.andP;  Keyfactors in a successful system's use include:andM;* Obtaining support for the entire process at all organizational levels,andM;* Informing users as to how to use and apply information,andM;* Ensuring that executives understand the methodology and its value.andM;If a costing/chargeback system is implemented with this appropriate strategy,only periodic changes should be needed to keep up with changing technology.andO;The ability to grow and change within the enterprise is a sign of aneffective costing approach.andM;Starting over indicates a lack of proper definition and management backing.andO;If companies reimplement costing, there is a problem with the system'sdefinition and not with the IS department.andM;In fact, reimplementing costing is usually as expensive as--and sometimeseven more expensive than--the original costing effort.andP;  Actualreimplementation expenses can range from $250,000 to $7 million.andP;  Theseexpenses can be incurred as a result of lack of user confidence in the oldsystem; poor standards, procedures and naming conventions for millions ofpieces of data; technology updates; and the time and energy involved inrestarting the entire project.andM;Impact on DecisionsandM;Good costing methods can also be measured by how much impact they have ondecisions.andP;  If users have confidence in the costing/chargeback process, theywill use it to make decisions to improve the enterprise.andM;As an example, when a major communications company added a costing/chargebackapproach, it made several changes because of the new data available.andP;  Thecompany did not have to buy 40 new IBM 3380 disk drives because it conducteda realistic cost/benefit analysis.andP;  It also removed two CPUs and slashedrelated hardware and software investments.andM;Once the users knew about the price of specific services, they made informeddecisions and decreased the costs associated with their data storage andprocessor backup capabilities.andP;  And users' satisfaction escalated becausethey were an integral part of the decision-making process.andP;  Management'sviews also changed because it could more effectively determine whethertechnology investments were being appropriately applied.andM;Predatory PricingandM;Many companies have not adopted costing because of problems with traditionalchargeback approaches.andP;  Many IS organizations have used costing andchargeback as a way to gain control of users.andP;  Sometimes IS organizationsattempt certain predatory pricing schemes in an attempt to make IS appearmore efficient at the expense of the user community.andM;These predatory pricing schemes normally take the form of &quot;shift differentialpricing,&quot; which reduces IS charges to users during off periods when the ISresources are not heavily in demand.andP;  Utility companies frequently offercustomers shift differential rates in order to encourage off-peak powerconsumption.andM;But when IS takes this approach, it does not take into account the additionalcosts to the enterprise in facilities maintenance, payroll expense and lossof productivity.andP;  Nor does it consider the impact on users who are unable totake advantage of the discounts due to customer demands for prompt turnaroundand online services.andM;Why Business Indicators Are KeyandM;Effective costing and chargeback systems must provide information that ismeaningful to both the users and management.andP;  A system should be capable ofproviding information based on KBIs used in the enterprise's business plan.andM;KBIs can vary according to the type of industry.andP;  Each company has todetermine these factors by looking at the enterprise's business plan and bytying the indicators back to its IS expenses.andP;  When a total chargebackmethodology is in place, companies can learn what IS costs are incurred ingenerating a product.andM;Although KBIs are not used by many companies, some advanced groups have begunimplementing them.andP;  Hence, their IS organizations are more clearly alignedwith the corporate business objectives.andM;Costing/chargeback methods have different levels of maturity to address userneeds.andP;  They are:andM;* Phase One.andP;  Costing reports are based on resource units such as CPU hours,direct access storage device tracks or reels of tape to ensure accuracy.andP;  ISmust work closely with users and executives to enhance understanding.andM;* Phase Two.andP;  All appropriate reporting is moved into a business or naturalunit reporting, such as checks produced or reports processed.andP;  The systemrequires less direct IS involvement.andP;  Later, usage is defined according tothe KBIs.andM;*hase Three.andP;  Contracts are developed between the user and IS management forthe costing process.andM;This last phase--developing contracts--is a sophisticated approach todetermining expectations for both users and IS.andP;  After analyzing the users'work load, IS and user management agree on fixed monthly expenses andpredetermined levels of service based on user predictions.andM;These contracts are not that predominant today because few organizations havea good enough basic understanding of costing and usage to support theprocess.andP;  But, within the next 10 years, contracts will be more evident.andM;Contracts encourage consistent use of IS resources by setting service levelagreements that ensure the availability of systems and the delivery ofservices at predetermined response times.andP;  If IS does not deliver theseforecasted services, the user may receive a discount.andP;  In this way, ISbecomes a true corporate utility by providing a certain level of service andresponsiveness, suffering financial consequences if promised services are notdelivered.andM;The Two-way ContractandM;The contract works both ways.andP;  If users end up drawing on significantly moreor fewer IS resources than they agreed to, financial penalties can be imposedon them, as well.andP;  Thus, the contracts recognize the fact that costs areincurred even if users don't fully utilize requested services because IS hadto install a certain level of capacity to meet user forecasts.andP;  And, ofcourse, the contracts recognize that, if usage significantly exceeds theforecast, additional capacity must be acquired.andM;Contracts alone, however, are not the final measure of the success of a goodcosting system.andP;  When it comes to the bottom line, the true measure of aneffective costing/chargeback approach is how well management--and all levelsof the organization--accept and use the information provided by the costingsystem.andP;  Although users may not always like the answers provided, theirinvolvement in and understanding of how costs are derived are the truemeasures of success.andM;Bill Henry is a managing associate in the Information Technology Group ofCoopers andamp; Lybrand in Dallas.andP;  He specializes in the areas of costing andchargeback.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
