And the resigning head of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration confirmed in Washington on Wednesday that he willhead up the project.   University of Utah President Chase Peterson said the $5 millionwill sustain the research while the university and state officialsnegotiate with 200 private corporations that have indicated aninterest.   The chairman of the university's chemistry department and aBritish professor announced last week that they had done what hasstumped scientists for more than 30 years _ creating energy byfusing atoms in glass flasks at room temperature. Scientists aroundthe world greeted the announcement with enthusiasm and skepticism,including one who warned that if the so-called cold fusion hadoccurred it could pose a serious radiation threat.   The implications of such a discovery are enormous _ cheap, safe,simple electrical power in an era dominated by petroleum-fueledpolitical tensions.   Potential applications range from ``100 horsepower power plantssmall enough for a car'' to 50-megawatt generating plants, saidJames Brophy, university vice president for research.   ``We know the science is true. We don't know about theengineering and economics,'' he said.   Gov. Norm Bangerter announced Tuesday that the Legislature willconvene April 7 to appropriate the funds. House and Senate leaders,who had balked on the appropriation until the experiments wereconfirmed, were sold on the idea after Peterson outlined theprocess during a closed meeting earlier Tuesday and promised thatthe agenda for the special session would be limited to fusion.   Because the university has applied for patents on the fusionprocess, lawmakers are hoping that the state will realize afinancial windfall by licensing private corporations to use thetechnology.   ``The numbers are staggering in terms of what this thing willbring in if the patents hold,'' said House Speaker Nolan Karras.   House Majority Leader H. Craig Moody said Wednesday he had nodoubt the Legislature would approve the funding. ``It's not amatter of if it will happen, but when,'' he said.   The cash will help the university lure ``five to 15 worldexperts'' in fusion and engineering, Peterson said.   James Fletcher, 69, the NASA chief who has already beenrecruited, is a physicist who was the university's president from1964-71.   ``If they do'' verify the experiment, Fletcher said, ``it isreally something gangbusters. That would be the best thing that'shappened since I guess the atomic bomb _ and that was bad, but interms of breakthroughs it would certainly be a bigger factor thanthe transistor when that was built.'' ``But the jury is still out.We still have to verify it,'' he added.   University officials said Edward Teller, recognized as thefather of the hydrogen bomb, may visit the campus sometime nextweek.   Fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs.   ``The real question is, how do we stay out in front of the worldon this. This identifies Utah as a center now'' for cold-fusionresearch, Peterson said at the news conference.   Electrochemists Stanley Pons of Utah and Martin Fleischmann ofthe University of Southampton in England announced last Thursdaythat they had sustained fusion for more than 100 hours in a flask.   They said they generated four watts of electricity for every onewatt they used to power their device.   Pons and Fleischmann's research will be published in May by theJournal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, and an article has beensubmitted to the British science journal Nature, said universityspokeswoman Barbara Shelley.   Peterson acknowledged the process could prove invalid or withoutpractical application. But he said he believed the research wassolid. He said several scientists, whom he did not identify, hadreviewed the Pons and Fleischmann article and were optimistic theexperiment did in fact produce fusion.   John Soures, a University of Rochester fusion researcher, saidthat if the Utah experiment actually produced energy, it alsoemitted dangerous levels of neutron particles.</TEXT></DOC>
