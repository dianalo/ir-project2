CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Signs of dawn for a new openness toward religionappeared in the Soviet Union in 1988, while in the United States,twilight descended on the career of a scandal-tainted TV evangelist.   These were among major news stories of religion in a year alsomarked by indignation about a movie, blunted hopes about an ancientburial shroud and arrests for anti-abortion demonstrations.   Roman Catholicism had its first modern schism, while theEpiscopal Church seemed on the way to ordaining the first womanbishop in world Anglicanism, and fundamentalists solidified theirSouthern Baptist control.   Also making headlines was an ex-administration official's booksaying Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer to help plan PresidentReagan's schedule, and the launching by mainline religious bodies ofan interfaith cable-TV network.   There were numerous other religious notes in the news, includingthe failed presidential bids by two Baptists _ the Rev. JesseJackson, Democrat, and Pat Robertson, who resigned the ministry toseek the Republican nomination.   Samplings indicated white Protestants, including evangelicals andthe religious right, gave the margin to the winner, George Bush.   The year's development that seemed to promise the most long-rangeand historically significant shift in the religious climate beganunfolding in the Soviet Union with its new policy of ``glasnost,''or openness.   In contrast to more than a half century of severe religioussuppression, Soviet doors opened to the importation of Bibles, togradually eased religious restrictions, to promised legal revisionsto assure religious rights.   Church dignitaries from around the world took part in Sovietcelebrations marking the millenium of Christianity there.   American TV evangelism got a jolt when a prominent practicioner,Jimmy Swaggart, confessed on the air to moral transgressions, laterdisclosed as involvement with a New Orleans prostitute.   When he defied disciplinary procedures ordered by the Assembliesof God and resumed his broadcasts, it defrocked him. His audiencedwindled _ down from 1.7 million a year ago to 836,000.   It was the second recent downfall of a prominent TV evangelist.Jim Bakker had been scuttled by a sex scandal the year before.   Hollywood sparked a bombshell in religious ranks when it releasedthe controversial film ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' drawingwidespread protests and picketing by Christians.   The film, based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was criticizedfor depicting Christ as weak, afraid, vacillating and lusting forwomen.   Fascination with the Shoud of Turin got a setback when carbon-14tests performed at three separate institutions found that it datedfrom medieval times and could not have been the burial clothwrapping Christ's body.   However, some advocates _ including some scientists _ questionedthe procedures used, and insisted the issue still was unresolved.   More than 1,000 people were arrested and jailed, usually briefly,in a wave of demonstrations of civil disobedience around the countryto block entrances to abortion clinics.   A minor schism occurred in Roman Catholicism when traditionalistArchbishop Marcel Lefebvre ordained four bishops in defiance of theVatican and was ex-communicated, along with those persisting in hismovement.   Lefebvre rejects reforms of the Second Vatican Council of1962-65, charging it with ``democratizing'' and ``Protestantizing''the church.   The Episcopal diocese of Massachusetts elected a woman as bishop,the Rev. Barbara C. Harris, and if the choice is affirmed by otherdioceses, she would become the first woman bishop in the worldwideAnglican Communion.   The Anglican church, like Roman Catholicism and EasternOrthodoxy, maintains bishops in succession from apostolic times, sofar confined to men. The prospect of a woman in it has stirredorganized opposition.   Fundamentalists continued their decade-long streak of victoriesin the Southern Baptist convention, electing another of theiradherents, the Rev. Jerry Vines, as president.   His appointive powers largely deterimines institutional trustees,and the victory this time completed gradual ascendancy offundamentalist majorities on boards throughout the denomination'sinstitutions and agencies.   Other major religion stories of the year included:   _American Catholic bishops decided to produce another paper onAIDS, after some bishops objected to a previous document's referenceto condoms as a possible protection.   _Catholic bishops also shot back to the Vatican their strongobjections to a Vatican analysis questioning the basis of nationalcouncils of bishops.   _The Rev. James Andrews won re-election as chief executiveofficer of the the Presbyterian Church (USA), overcoming a closechallenge by a woman candidate.   _The National Council of Churches, caught in a financial bind,began steps to reorganize, indicating efforts to form a broaderecumenical structure including Roman Catholics and evangelicals.   _``New Age'' spirituality, a mix of various religious and othertraditions, attracted widening attention.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs Dec. 30</NOTE></DOC>
