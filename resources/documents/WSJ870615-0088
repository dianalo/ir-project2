The unusual session was arranged in an effort to pressure farm ministers into accepting spending cuts. It comes at the start of a meeting of agriculture ministers that could last into next week. Despite several attempts at agreement during the past three months, the ministers remain divided on farm prices.    The economics and finance ministers, meanwhile, have been resisting calls by the EC Commission for extra funds to bridge a budget deficit expected to reach five billion European currency units ($5.73 billion) this year.    &quot;We think it's essential that the agriculture ministers be informed of the grave budgetary situation,&quot; a commission spokesman said. In some countries, he added, finance and farm ministers appear to disagree on EC spending.    EC officials said formal decisions aren't expected from the joint meeting, which is scheduled to last only two hours. After the session, economics and finance ministers will hold their own discussions, which are expected to include strengthening the European Monetary System.    Agriculture ministers will go on to tackle the most controversial elements of the price package, including a proposed tax on EC-produced and imported oils and fats. </TEXT></DOC>
