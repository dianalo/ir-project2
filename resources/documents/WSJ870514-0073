The measure came in response to three military rebellions last month by officers demanding an end to human rights trials. In a country wracked by coups over the past half-century, it constituted a controversial attempt to bury differences between the army and civilian society. President Alfonsin said he agreed to the law because Argentina was close to &quot;civil war.&quot;    The law, which seemed certain to be approved in both the lower house and Senate, met criticism from both opposition politicians and human rights groups. Peronist Congressman Diego Guelar said the government had &quot;compromised itself with the armed forces and left itself open to permanent tutelage by the military.&quot; Human rights lawyer Emilio Mignone described it as &quot;an error and a capitulation.&quot;    But although the president has clearly opened himself to the risk of new arm-twisting by the military, he appeared to have no choice. The rebellions last month were backed by the whole of the armed forces, and revealed that the president could not control the army of which he is commander in chief. In the view of most analysts, a further consolidation of democracy -- restored in 1983 after seven years of military rule -- had thus become impossible without broaching a process of reconciliation and integration with the armed forces.    &quot;Without this law, there could be no progress on anything. There would have been new rebellions and a gradual erosion of civil power,&quot; said military expert Rosendo Fraga.    The so-called &quot;due obedience&quot; bill, hastily prepared in a week of frantic negotiation, will exclude from prosecution all officers who were obeying orders. The only crimes that will remain punishable are rape, theft and child abduction. Most analysts believe its effect will be to virtually end military trials. Between 250 and 400 officers, most of them retired, had been indicted and were awaiting trial.    Although both the president and human rights groups claimed the exceptions to the law would allow some further trials, lawyers and other observers believe the measure would virtually end the human rights prosecutions. The bulk of the charges don't fall in the categories for which the law would make exceptions.    In the first prosecutions of a South American junta, five military leaders have been jailed for their role in the &quot;dirty war.&quot; Five other military officers also have been imprisoned. Human rights groups claim as many as 30,000 people may have died in what the military says was a successful war to thwart a Marxist takeover of the country. The official number of desparecidos, or people who disappeared, is just over 9,000.    President Alfonsin's popularity appeared unlikely to suffer markedly if the measure succeeds in calming the armed forces. Many Argentines are now keen to close the issue of the &quot;dirty war,&quot; which they see as divisive and unconstructive. However, the opposition Peronists are certain to dwell on the issue in the run-up to crucial congressional and gubernatorial elections Sept. 6, and the president may lose some of the left-wing support his Radical Civic Union party has attracted.    Meanwhile, the process of reaching an understanding with the army is certain to be long and difficult. Resentment has run high not only over the trials, but also over cuts in the military budget, falling wages, aging equipment and a general sense that the army has no role in the country. President Alfonsin has promised to set up a committee to examine these problems, but their resolution will not be easy.    While such grudges persist, the temptation may continue in some sectors of the military to test again the rebellious methods which precipitated the &quot;due obedience&quot; law. President Alfonsin's gamble is that such officers would no longer find the support of the rest of the armed forces. </TEXT></DOC>
