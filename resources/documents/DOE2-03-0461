Hydrogenhas major advantages as a motor and aviation fuel due to its high energycontent per unit mass. The disadvantages of hydrogen as fuel mainly concernsuch factors as low volumetric energy content of liquid hydrocarbons,its extremely low normal boiling point and the large mass of hydridesused in storing hydrogen as a solid. Hydrogen can be produced by waterelectrolysis at a cost of about 40% to 50% of the present selling priceof petrol depending on the size of the plant. The production cost ofhydrogen via coal gasification is only 23% of the present selling priceof petrol (84 RSA Cents/l). Hydrogen as road transportation fuel fora limited range of 100 km is in many respects superior to present andfuture battery systems. Hydrogen energy systems will in all probabilitydominate the energy carrier scene during the next century.</TEXT></DOC>
