The talks in Mexico will pit representatives of a battle-temperedguerrilla army against members of a right-wing government thatconsiders them little more than murderous brigands.   ``The two ways of looking at these talks are very different,''said Guillermo Ungo, leader of a leftist political coalition alliedwith the rebels.   ``The government views them as dialogue-concertation,demobilization of the guerrillas and administration of democratizingaspirins. The guerrillas see them as dialogue-negotiation, truedemocratization, then demobilization.   ``And democratization here is not a matter of aspirins. Itrequires major surgery.''   The rebel delegation includes two of the five members of the highcommand of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.One of the two is Joaquin Villalobos, considered the most seniormember of the organization.   President Alfredo Cristiani's delegation includes twoCabinet-level officials, one of whom is a retired army colonel andthe president's chief of staff. It also includes lawyers andacademics representative of the right-wing private sector.   The rebels said Monday their suspension of sabotage _ one oftheir most effective weapons _ and declaration of an 11-dayunilateral cease-fire are clear indications of determination toreach accords.   But they expressed doubts about the government's good faith.   ``We note with concern that Mr. Cristiani and his government areplacing obstacles in the way of the upcoming meeting by opposing thelogical and necessary presence of international witnesses, amoderator and national and international observers, and in so doing,are trying to establish a closed dialogue,'' said their communique.   Cristiani considers this week's sessions preparatory. He saysthey will deal with the mechanism for proceeding with talks ratherthan substantive issues. The question of whether a moderator willtake part remains to be resolved, he says.   The rebels have insisted that Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, thearchbishop of San Salvador, participate as moderator. Thearchibishop is on a tour of Europe and the United States and willnot take part in Wednesday's meeting.   Auxiliary archbishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez is to attend thesessions as a ``witness.''   The rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982, ElSalvador exhibits only a democratic veneer. They say individualliberties are systematically violated and that public avowal ofsocialism still entails the risk of one's life.   The insurgents also contend that civilian authority remainssubordinate to the veto and tutelage of the virulently anti-leftistarmed forces.   Cristiani, in a press conference last week dealing with theupcoming dialogue, said, ``Here there is no state of war. The FMLNsimply operates outside the law.''   The rebels, on their clandestine radio, ridiculed the president'sperception of the state of the situation.   ``Only President Cristiani in his marble tower thinks there is nowar in our country. If there's no war, then what are we going toMexico to talk about?'' they said.</TEXT></DOC>
