The hydrogen atoms werefound to be situated at the 8 c sites, (0,0,0), which correspond to aset of octahedral (O/sub z/) sites, and the distribution functions weresmoothly extended over the four surrounding tetrahedral sites. To comparewith these results, crystallographic parameters and distribution functionsof deuterium in {beta}-V/sub 2/D, monoclinic Cm, have been determinedby re-analyzing neutron diffraction data previously obtained. Isotopicdifferences between the {beta}/sub 1/-V/sub 2/H and {beta}-V/sub 2/Dstructures were visualized. The distribution functions of hydrogen anddeuterium were compared with the ground-state wave-functions calculatedby Fukai and Sugimoto.</TEXT></DOC>
