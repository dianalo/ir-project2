In documents filed with a federal appeals court, theMassachusetts Academy of Trial Attorneys said the conduct ofattorneys representing Beatrice Foods Co. and the owner of a Woburntannery threatened to undermine the judicial system by encouraginglawyers to flout court rules.   ``The court must support those who abide by the rules and exposethose who bend them to their own advantage,'' the academy said in abrief filed to support the request by eight Woburn families for anew trial in their suit against Beatrice and the John J. Riley Co.tannery.   ``A wrongdoer should be unable to take comfort or benefit in ajudgment obtained by cheating,'' the academy said in the brieffiled Tuesday with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   The lawyers' group singled out Beatrice attorney Jerome Facherof the law firm of Hale andamp; Dorr for its harshest criticism.   ``The concealment of information through misrepresentation andmisconduct was accomplished by the lead attorney for thedefendant,'' the academy said. ``As a senior member of the bar, hecommands respect and attention. How the court determines theappropriateness of his conduct will not go unnoticed.''   Without naming her, the academy also lambasted Mary Ryan of thelaw firm Nutter, McClennen andamp; Fish, the attorney for Riley, whichbought the tannery from Beatrice. The families blame the tanneryfor polluting the town's water supply.   Neither Facher nor Ryan returned telephone calls Wednesday fromThe Associated Press.   The academy frequently files briefs in cases involving complexand controversial legal issues. It did not specify requestedsanctions against the lawyers.   The filing with the appeals court followed U.S. District JudgeWalter Jay Skinner's decision in January denying the families a newtrial.   Their original suit contended four parties were responsible forthe pollution, Beatrice and Riley, W.R. Grace Co., and Unifirst, auniform supply company. Unifirst settled prior to trial and W.R.Grace settled for a reported $8 million halfway through the trial.Skinner dismissed the portion of the suit against Beatrice and thetannery.   The families asked for a new trial after their attorney learnedof a 1983 report that was not disclosed by Facher or Ryan. Thereport said it was possible that dumping on the tannery propertycontributed to groundwater pollution near two town wells.   Skinner ruled that Facher and Ryan were aware of the report butfailed to disclose it to the families. But the judge refused toorder a new trial, saying he did not think the report would haveaffected the outcome of the case and that the families failed toprove the concealment was deliberate.   The families' attorney, Jan Schlichtmann, and the academy saidSkinner applied the wrong standard in deciding the issue, sayingthat he was wrong to speculate that the report would not have ledto evidence favorable to the claim that pollution on the tanneryproperty seeped into the town's water supply.</TEXT></DOC>
