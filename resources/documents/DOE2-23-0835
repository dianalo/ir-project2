Weobserved that spontaneous recA(Srf) mutants accumulated in cultures ofrecB recC sbcB sulA::Mu dX(Ap lac) lexA51 recF cells because they grewfaster than the parental strain. We show that in a uvrA recB+ recC+ geneticbackground there are two prerequisites for the suppression by recA(Srf)of the UV-sensitive phenotype of recF mutants. (i) The recA(Srf) proteinmust be provided in increased amounts either by SOS derepression or bya recA operator-constitutive mutation in a lexA(Ind) (no induction ofSOS functions) genetic background. (ii) The gene recJ, which has beenshown previously to be involved in the recF pathway of recombinationand repair, must be functional. The level of expression of recJ in alexA(Ind) strain suffices for full suppression. Suppression by recA441at 30 degrees C also depends on recJ+. The hampered induction by UV ofthe SOS gene uvrA seen in a recF mutant was improved by a recA(Srf) mutation.This improvement did not require recJ+. We suggest that recA(Srf) andrecA(Tif) mutant proteins can operate in postreplication repair independentof recF by using the recJ+ function.</TEXT></DOC>
