The announcement to halt engine and stamping production atEngine Plant 2 in Windsor was expected since no product had beenallocated for the 67-year-old plant past the end of next year.   The Canadian Auto Workers recently urged Ford to make a decisionon the plant's future to allow workers to look for other jobs.   The plant also was shut down in 1981 during a slump in theautomotive industry, but it was temporarily reactived in 1983 tomeet increased demand for the five-liter V-8 engine.   Ford has been telling workers for the last few years that thereis no production planned for the plant at the end of 1990, said LeoBrown, manager of Ford's Windsor engine plants.   The city has two other Ford engine plants, a casting plant andan aluminum plant.   The number of Ford cars using the five-liter engine has declinedand some have been replaced by the 3.8-litre engine, Brown said.</TEXT></DOC>
