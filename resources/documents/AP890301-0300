(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Xerox Corp. hopes a copier introducedWednesday will save the encyclopedias, dictionaries and other booksin libraries around the country from broken-binding syndrome.   The Xerox 5042 has a slanted edge and a hinged cover that allow abook or other bound material to be laid flat without squashing orstretching the binding.   ``We've responded very directly to a market need,'' said PaulCahn, vice president of reprographics product support for Xerox'sU.S. Marketing Group.   Xerox officials said their studies found that libraries spentabout $40 million in 1985 to repair broken book bindings.   ``This is very much of a niche kind of product, but it's the kindof thing that will give Xerox a presence in places it wants to be,like universities and libraries, where a lot of people will seetheir name,'' said Bob Sostilio, a copier-industry analyst withDataquest Inc., of San Jose, Calif.   The 5042 makes 35 copies a minute and can make reductions andenlargements. It sells for $9,470.   The machine also features a vending attachment that acceptscoins, bills and magnetic cards.   ``We have offered vending before, but it was just coins,'' saidJim Miller, Xerox's manager of decentralized product marketing.``And librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole daymaking change for people.''   The American Library Association asked copier companies to comeup with a copier that wouldn't damage books and would make bettercopies of bound materials.   Xerox is one of two companies to offer a machine built withlibraries in mind.   The other manufacturer, Oce Business Systems of Venlo,Netherlands, introduced two library copiers in January, said companyspokesman John James.   Also on Wednesday, Xerox introduced two new low-volume copiersthat are designed to keep the company ahead in that highlycompetitive segment of the market, which includes copiers that makeup to 30 copies a minute.   All three machines were displayed at a news conference at thecompany's major manufacturing center in the Rochester suburb ofWebster. Xerox is based in Stamford, Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
