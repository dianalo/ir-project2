The increase, effective immediately, pushes the base lending rateto its highest level since May 1985, when it was lowered a halfpercentage point to 10 percent.   Chase Manhattan was the first institution to announce the hike,with several other major banks joining the move, including Citibank,Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Bankers Trust andMorgan Guaranty Trust Co.   Reaction in the financial markets was restrained. At noon on WallStreet, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.33 points to2,069.35, while bond prices were mixed. The dollar initially rose inforeign exchange trading, but quickly retreated.   Analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steadyincrease of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks.   ``It comes as no surpise given the rise in short-term rates,''said William V. Sullivan, economist for the investment firm DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.   Sullivan said there also was ``building perception in themarketplace'' that the Federal Reserve might push rates even furtherby raising its discount rate, or the interest charged to memberbanks for loans, to support the dollar.   Concerns about the growing federal budget and trade deficits havepushed the dollar sharply lower against most major currencies inrecent weeks.   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money andtrails more subtle increases in other interest rates.   But the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basisfor calculating loans to businesses and for determining many typesof fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popularhome-equity loans.   ``It's clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowingcosts in December or early next year,'' said Sullivan.</TEXT></DOC>
