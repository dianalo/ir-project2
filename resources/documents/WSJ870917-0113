Several senators said they agreed with Judge Bork's opposition to discrimination by race, but thought it was scandalous that the amendment leaves Congress free to pass some laws that differentiate between the sexes. Judge Bork reminded them that they have prohibited female soldiers from fighting in combat. He also noted that while all public facilities must be integrated by race, he doubted that anyone thinks the Constitution requires unisex toilets. </TEXT></DOC>
