On other markets, livestock and meat traders were startled by agovernment report of big grain stocks; energy futures fell;precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.   The National Weather Service's latest 30-day outlook, issuedlate Wednesday, gave a big boost to grain and soybean futures,analysts said.   ``They're calling for almost no rainfall from Illinois east toOhio and higher-than-normal temperatures in Iowa, Illinois andMissouri, the three biggest soybean states,'' said Joel Karlin,research analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``That'sone area that really needs rain.''   Wheat futures turned in the strongest performance, with mostcontracts advancing the expanded 30 cents-a-bushel daily limit.   The rally was driven by concern about further drought damage tothe spring wheat crop in the northern Great Plains and worries thatWednesday's heavy rains in the central and southern Plains wouldhamper progress on the winter wheat harvest, Karlin said.   Rich Feltes, director of commodity research with Refco Inc. inChicago, said the recent sharp rise in corn and soybean meal priceshas made wheat more attractive as a livestock feed and sparkedfears of a physical shortage of wheat.   ``There is not enough wheat in 1988-89 for both animals andhumans,'' Feltes said. ``We've got to do something quickly toprovide an economic disincentive for wheat feeding.'' In otherwords, wheat prices must rise, he said.   Some oat and soybean contracts also posted limit gains, andprices for July deliveries of all grains and soybeans soaredfreely. The exchange removed limits on the July contracts Wednesdayin a routine action linked to their upcoming expiration.   After the close, the Agriculture Department issued its monthlygrain stocks report, which showed larger-than-expected U.S. stocksof corn, wheat and soybeans as of June 1.   Analysts pronounced the report bearish but said weather factorslikely would continue to dominate the grain trade.   Wheat settled 27{ cents to 33{ cents higher with July at $3.87 abushel; corn was 8\ cents to 18 cents higher with July at $3.27 abushel; oats were 7} cents to 18 cents higher with July at $3.53 abushel; soybeans were 24{ cents to 55 cents higher with July at$9.86 a bushel.   The USDA also issued its monthly hogs and pigs report, whichsurprised observers with its larger-than-expected estimate of thenation's hog herd as of June 1. The report also showed a sharplyhigher tally of pigs born from March through May than most analystshad expected, and it indicated hog producers intended to breed arelatively large number of sows through November.   The report was called bearish for futures prices, but analystsnoted that it reflected breeding intentions prior to this month'ssharp rise in feed-grain prices. Producers likely will reduce theirbreeding plans in light of the higher hog-production costs,analysts said.   ``It's kind of hard to look at the corn and soybean prices we'vegot right now and believe producers are going to breed at theselevels over the next six months,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst withSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. ``That would be likethe stock market rallying to new highs with the prime rate justhaving increased 10 points.''   In trading ahead of the report, live cattle settled .30 centlower to .43 cent higher with August at 64.60 cents a pound; feedercattle were .20 cent to 1.05 cents lower with August at 73.97 centsa pound; hogs were .25 cent to 1.18 cents higher with July at 46.32cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .53 cent lower to .63 centhigher with July at 37.25 cents a pound.   Oil prices dropped in fairly active trading on the New YorkMercantile Exchange after Egypt announced it was lowering its crudeexport prices for the first half of July.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 27 cents to 33 cents lowerwith August at $15.16 a barrel; heating oil was .64 cent to 1.04cents lower with July at 40.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .68 cent to 1.23 cents lower with July at 51.94 cents a gallon.   Gold retreated slightly while silver advanced a bit in lighttrading on the Commodity Exchange in New York.   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.10 lower with August at $437.70 atroy ounce; silver was 5.3 cents to 7.4 cents higher with July at$6.678 a troy ounce.
