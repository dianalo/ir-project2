The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, however,ordered the health-care products company to post a $1 millionbond pending further arguments on whether the painkiller andsleeping pill unfairly copies the packaging of Excedrin PM, asimilar product made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</LP><TEXT>   Both products have dark-blue and light-blue packaging.Excedrin PM has been on the market about 20 years, whileTylenol PM was introduced about a year ago. Johnson andamp;Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., has placed TylenolPM's annual sales at $60 million. Bristol-Myers, New York,declined to disclose Excedrin PM sales.   Johnson andamp; Johnson sought the stay after a federal judge inUniondale, N.Y., last week issued a temporary injunctionagainst the sale of the product. The judge, Arthur D. Spatt,said Johnson andamp; Johnson &quot;acted in bad faith&quot; in packagingTylenol PM in a similar way to Bristol-Myer's Excedrin PMwith the intention of confusing consumers. The appeals courtwill hear additional arguments in April, a spokeswoman forBristol-Myers said.</TEXT></DOC>
