The intent ofthe test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumptionthat will assist consumers in making purchase decisions. These test proceduresappear in the Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">DOE amended the test procedure regulations on September 26, 1980 [45FR 64108] and November 26, 1986 [51 FR 42823]. These provisions allow theAssistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarilytest procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows thatthe basic model contains one or more design characteristics which preventtesting of the basic model according to the prescribed test proceduresor when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model ina manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption characteristicsas to provide materially inadequate comparative data. The 1986 amendmentsprovide that an interim waiver from test procedures requirements will begranted by the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energyif it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardshipif the application for interim waiver is denied, if it appears likely thatthe petition for waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy determines that it would be desirablefor public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determinationon the petition for waiver. andSection; 430.27.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Department finds that it would be desirable for public policyreasons to grant Trane's Application for Interim Waiver. Specifically,in those instances where DOE has granted a waiver for a similar productdesign, it is in the public's interest to have similar products testedand rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control havebeen granted to the Coleman Company, Magic Chef Company, and Rheem ManufacturingCompany. 50 FR 2710, January 18, 1985, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985, and53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, respectively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, Trane's Application for an Interim Waiver requesting relieffrom the DOE test procedures for its TUC(^) series and TDC(^) series ofcondensing furnaces is granted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Trane shall be permitted to test its TUC(^) series and TDC(^) seriesof condensing furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in10 CFR Part 430, with the modification set forth below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-1982 is deleted andreplaced with the following paragraph:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditionsare achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurementsperformed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, usingthe thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after themain burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-upby 1.5 minutes (t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor todrive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in whichcase the burner and blower shall be started together; (2) the furnace isdesigned to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start theblower, or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperaturesafety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan controlshall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fancontrol is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature.If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay,(t^), using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During theheat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipewith andplusmin;0.01 inch of water gauge of the manufacturer's recommendedon-period draft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This interim waiver shall remain in effect for 180 days from the dateof issuance or until the Department of Energy issues a determination onTrane's Petition for Waiver, whichever occurs first.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This interim waiver is based upon the prescribed validity of statementsand allegations submitted by the applicant.

Waiver is requested from the condensingfurnace test procedure found at Appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430. TheHeat-Up Test procedure requires a 1.5 minute time delay between burnerand blower-startup. Significant energy is lost during the delay period.Starting in April 1989, Trane will manufacture condensing furnaces havingfixed timing controls which will activate the blower 0.5 minutes afterburner start-up. These furnaces will include the TUC(^) upflow and TDC(^)downflow model families. These controls reduce losses by 1.6% to 2.0%,or approximately 20% of the total energy losses. The current proceduresdo not recognize such controls causing energy losses to be overstated.The petition requests that the true delay be used for more accurate representationof efficiency. Confidential supporting test data is available upon request.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An interim waiver is requested because it seems likely that our waiverwill be granted. Similar waivers have been granted to Coleman, Magic Chef,and Rheem. All central furnace manufacturers known to Trane have been notifiedby letter of our application. A copy of the letter and a list of the manufacturersis attached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sincerely, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">L.E.
