As a result of problems with electronic-componentsuppliers and other factors, Baxter International Inc.'sNovacor unit said it stopped developing a version of itsheart-assist pump that had been the main focus of the federalprogram. Consequently, the National Heart, Lung and BloodInstitute, the federal agency involved, said it has stoppeddevelopment with Novacor of the device. Novacor, however, isindependently continuing to develop a similar pump at anearlier stage of research than the discontinued one.</LP><TEXT>   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Baxterfell 12.5 cents to $36.375.   The pumps are &quot;ventricular assist devices,&quot; or VADs, whichdon't replace the heart but take over its main chamber'sfunction of sending blood through the body. Simpler and lessinvasive than artificial hearts, VADs are expected to be putinto widespread permanent use before mechanical hearts are.Prototypes powered externally through wires or tubes thatpenetrate the chest already are used experimentally to keepheart-failure patients alive while waiting for hearttransplants.   Novacor, based in Oakland, Calif., and ThermoCardiosystems Inc., Woburn, Mass., are the main competitorsin a race to develop &quot;permanently&quot; implantable VADs in whichpower is transmitted magnetically through the skin,dispensing with external consoles and protruding wires.Physicians hope the devices will replace the need for hearttransplants in many cases.   Novacor said it is continuing to develop its N100 pump,which has been used in clinical trials with an external powerconsole as a &quot;bridge to transplant.&quot; The N100, however,hasn't yet been put through extensive reliability tests.Novacor's discontinued device, the N120, was the only VAD sofar to have passed a two-year reliability test of continuousrunning that the federal heart institute considered aprerequisite for clinical tests of a permanently implantableVAD, said Claude Lenfant, director of the institute. Clinicaltests of the permanently implantable N120 had been expectedto begin last fall, he added, but had been delayed by variousproblems.   Linda Strauss, a Novacor spokeswoman, said that &quot;when wehad problems getting electronic components for the N120, itgave us a chance to step back and reassess our overall goals.We decided it didn't make sense to move forward with twodevices.&quot; Moreover, &quot;the N120 was never intended to be awidely available commercial product,&quot; she said.   She added that two-year reliability tests of the N100won't necessarily be required to launch clinical trials ofthe permanently implantable version of the pump.   Novacor said the temporary version of the N100, powered byan external console, already has been used for some 370 daysin an individual awaiting a transplant.</TEXT></DOC>
