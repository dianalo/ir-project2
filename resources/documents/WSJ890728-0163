Lately, though, the nipping by the Times (daily circulation: 103,652) has managed to keep the Post (circulation: 812,419) jumping.    &quot;We feel like an expansion baseball team on a 10-game winning streak,&quot; says Wesley Pruden, managing editor of the conservative Times.    &quot;We're a little like a supertanker,&quot; says the liberal Post's Mr. Downie. &quot;Our sheer size makes it difficult sometimes to turn around. We got off to a slow start.&quot;    This isn't exactly the Pentagon Papers or Watergate; the battle between these two newspapers has been fought the past month over a little scandal involving homosexual &quot;call boys,&quot; credit-card fraud, a midnight tour of the White House and social climbing and influence peddling by a classic Washington hustler who seems to have vanished.    The opening salvo was fired June 29 when the Times, owned by members of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, charged, in a banner front-page headline, that &quot;Homosexual prostitution inquiry ensnares VIPs with Reagan, Bush.&quot;    The paper said the prostitution ring's clients included &quot;key officials&quot; of the two administrations, plus military officers, congressional aides &quot;and U.S. and foreign businessmen with close social ties to Washington's political elite.&quot;    Many of the clients, the paper said, paid for the services of their &quot;call boys&quot; with American Express, Visa and MasterCard credit cards. Most of these services were fraudulently billed through a funeral home. A typical billing was &quot;cremation urn, $150.&quot; The Times reported, ominously, that it had carefully examined hundreds of these credit-card vouchers but would disclose only the names &quot;of those found to be in sensitive government posts or positions of influence.&quot;    All of official Washington, agog at the possibilities, waited for the names. But the &quot;key officials&quot; turned out to be the ones named in the original story: a one-time personnel officer in the Reagan administration and a political liaison employee in President Bush's Labor Department.    The only other client named by the Times was its own assistant managing editor, a former minor official in the Reagan White House. &quot;When {Times reporter} Paul Rodriguez turned up with that suitcase full of vouchers, just about the first one that tumbled out was our own man,&quot; says Mr. Pruden. &quot;We accepted his resignation.&quot;    The Times surged back into action the next day, a Friday, with a page-one story that introduced Craig J. Spence, TV reporter, lobbyist, and self-promoter. The Times said its cache of credit-card vouchers indicated Mr. Spence paid as much as $20,000 a month for male prostitutes. That is more than the $12,000 a month he received from one of his lobbying clients, the Policy Study Group, a Tokyo-based non-profit organization seeking to promote Japanese business interests in the U.S. Some of the more sensational Japanese papers have given the Spence story big play.    More than most great world capitals, Washington is a rootless city, with no established social order. Mr. Spence, unheralded, set up shop here, and in no time at all, it seems, established himself as a host to such celebrity media figures as Ted Koppel, Eric Sevareid, and William Safire. And, yes, one of the guests at his $345,000 house in the tony Kalorama part of town was Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor of the Washington Times. Mr. Spence asked these well-known, successful people to dinner, and when they came, he showed them off to his business clients.    When Mr. Spence popped up in the Times that Friday, the editors at the Post, for the first time, were intrigued. &quot;We'd never heard of him,&quot; says Mr. Downie. Benjamin Bradlee, the Post's executive editor, stepped in, demanding full coverage. Mr. Downie instructed Mary Hadar, editor of the Style section, to work up a major profile of Mr. Spence, who is nowhere to be seen these days. She assigned a Style reporter to the story.    But the reporter, like almost everyone else in town, disappeared for a long Fourth of July weekend. &quot;I'd have asked someone else to be assigned to the story if I'd known that,&quot; says Mr. Downie. The profile finally appeared July 18.    Meanwhile, back at the Times, there was gloating all around. Mr. Pruden, in his regular column, speculated that the reason the Post was showing &quot;scant appetite for such a blockbuster story is that {Post Chairman} Katharine Graham doesn't want to embarrass her dinner-party A-list, which was, of course, Craig Spencer's dinner-party A-list.&quot;    Worst of all, the Post's in-house critic, ombudsman Richard Harwood, in his regular July 9 editorial-page column, lambasted the Post for &quot;complacency and arrogance&quot; in allowing a week to pass before making &quot;any serious effort to even check out the yarn.&quot;    The column infuriated Mr. Downie, the managing editor. &quot;For the first time since I've been in the job,&quot; says Mr. Harwood, &quot;he blew up at me.&quot;    Mr. Downie argues that the Post wrote about the prostitution ring in May and that a story, in answer to the Times' disclosures starting June 29, appeared in the Post's metro section July 1. That story indicated the scandal was basically about credit-card fraud.    Slowly, the editors at the Post began to turn the big supertanker around. On July 12, they ran a front-page story disclosing that Mr. Spence had given an $8,000 Rolex wristwatch to a uniformed Secret Service officer at the White House, whom they identified as Ronald A. deGueldre. The story also reported that Mr. deGueldre admitted to the Secret Service that he stole several pieces of the Truman china collection from a White House pantry and gave one plate to Mr. Spence. But, the Post said, Mr. deGueldre denied to its reporters he had stolen any china.    Apparently unchallenged is the Times' disclosure that Mr. deGueldre led Mr. Spence and a group of his friends, including two male prostitutes, on a midnight tour of the White House.    The Secret Service is continuing its investigation of the activities of Mr. deGueldre and at least one other uniformed officer. Other investigators are focusing on Henry Vinson, a West Virginia mortician who came to Washington two years ago and established control of the homosexual &quot;escort service.&quot;    The editors at the Times admit the Post was first with the report on the Truman china, but they won't concede the Rolex. &quot;We had the watch first&quot; in a July 6 story, says Mr. Pruden. Besides, he adds, &quot;they {the Post} got deGueldre's name wrong.&quot; His first name is Reginald, not Ronald. That was cause for some more public gloating. In its &quot;Inside the Beltway&quot; column on July 18, the Times said, &quot;Ronald was the old guy {President Reagan}, asleep upstairs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
