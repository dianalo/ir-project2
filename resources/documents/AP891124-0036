Scientists are using the laser to measure atmospheric windpatterns. They hope to use the measurements to design a satelliteequipped with a similar laser that will be able to measure windflows throughout the world, said John Theon of the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration.   ``We believe that if we can measure winds all over the globe, wecan double the accuracy of weather forecasts,'' he said. ``Thiswill be a breakthrough in our ability to understand weather and howit works.''   The NASA plane uses lasers to shoot out pulses of light that arereflected back by dust, pollen and water particles carried by theatmospheric winds. The delay and frequency change of thereflections are used to calculate the wind flows in a 9-milecross-section of the atmosphere.   Information from the plane's measurements will be combined withdata from nine Japanese land-based stations also using lasers tomeasure atmosphere winds, Toshikazu Itabe of the Japanese Ministryof Posts and Telecommunications told reporters here at the U.S.Yokota Air Base.   Improved knowledge of air flows also is expected to givescientists a better understanding of how heat and moisture aretransmitted through the atmosphere, Theon said. That should improvethe accuracy of predictions of rising global temperatures linked topollutants in the atmosphere that trap the earth's heat, called the``greenhouse effect.''   Scientists have predicted that the earth's average temperaturemay rise from 3 degrees to 6 degrees F) over the next 40 years ifthe amount of such pollutants in the atmosphere continue to rise atcurrent rates.   Such changes could cause major climatic changes, including apartial melting of the polar ice caps that might flood coastalareas and entire island nations.   ``The big remaining question regarding climate is the effect ofclouds,'' said James Spinhirne, a NASA scientist on board theplane. ``In current climatic models temperatures could fluctuate asmuch as (3.5-5.5 degrees) depending on the effect of clouds ontemperature flows.''   The laser technique, he said, allows much more accurate mappingof cloud patterns and movements than previous measurement methods.   Itabe said negotiations are underway between Japan's Science andTechnology Agency and NASA on cooperation in building the satellitesystem.   NASA hopes to launch the satellite by the late 1990s, Theon said.</TEXT></DOC>
