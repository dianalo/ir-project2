In other words, this invention separates big dust from thefuel gas by the centrifugal force through making the fuel gas pipingfor the back wash of the dust removing apparatus spiral. Also this inventionimproves the flow dividing capability of the divided flow connector bymaking the sections of the piping around the divided flow connector inputor the piping in the whole region elliptic, and thus dividing the outerportion with large big dust content and the inner portion with smallbig dust content respectively. Furthermore, a particle monitor is installedin the divided flow piping, which has a high dust contamination rate,after the divided flow connector in order to check the particle contentand when the result shows that the rate is within the safety level, thegas is returned again to the existing dust removing apparatus, but whenit is on the danger side, the gas is released with a selector to a gastreatment apparatus for incineration.
