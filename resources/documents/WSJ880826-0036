Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN INS </IN><TEXT>   The state that began a national revolt against high property taxes has a new cause: Kill all the lawyers -- or at least their high fees.    California voters will soon get a chance to do just that. Thanks to the insurance industry, the November ballot will include Proposition 106, which would impose the nation's stiffest restrictions by far on lawyers' contingency fees in injury suits.    In the state most laden with lawyers, you can imagine the reaction from the bar. But despite the attorneys' howls, early returns indicate that Proposition 106 has strong support -- and insurers have mounted a bitterly anti-lawyer advertising campaign to whip up additional votes.    &quot;If Las Vegas were taking odds,&quot; says Will Glennon, legal analyst for the California Trial Lawyers Association, &quot;they would heavily favor it. People don't like attorneys, and that is what this proposition is about.&quot;    Proposition 106 would slash lawyers' income in personal-injury and other civil liability cases. And the bigger the award, the lower the cap. The proposal would limit a lawyer's contingency fee at 25% of the first $50,000 of an award, 15% of the next $50,000 and 10% of anything exceeding $100,000. In a $1 million case, that works out to a fee of $110,000, or 11%, a drop of more than $200,000 from the standard 33% cut that most lawyers now pocket.    Proponents of the fee caps say attorneys are taking more than their fair share of what is awarded to victims. They also say high fees encourage attorneys to spurn settlement offers and to go after big judgments -- even when it's in the client's interests to settle.    &quot;We do not think there is a God -- given right that a lawyer make 'X' amount of money,&quot; says Allen Katz, an attorney for the Lawyers Fair Fee Committee, which was established by the insurance industry to promote the fee caps.    Other states have adopted contingency-fee restrictions, but none has been as severe as Proposition 106. Some lawyers say the proposal cuts fees so much that it will deter attorneys from taking on risky -- but legitimate -- cases. If the fee caps prevent clients from finding attorneys to handle their cases, they could be found unconstitutional, the lawyers say, since the victims would be deprived of due process of law.    The California ballot includes two other initiatives that would impose new contingency-fee limits. Championed by other insurance interests, those caps would apply only to auto-accident cases, however, and one of the proposals would be much less restrictive than Proposition 106.    Trial lawyers, meanwhile, are counting on a competing ballot initiative -- part of an insurance-reform package backed by the state attorney general -- that would prohibit fee regulation beyond the loosely worded ethical rules of the state bar. Those rules ban the charging of fees that are &quot;illegal or unconscionable.&quot;    If the fee-cap proposals and the insurance-reform package pass, whichever gets the most votes will determine how contingency fees are regulated.    The fee fight stems from a long battle between insurers and lawyers over the causes of the insurance-rate explosion of the 1980s. Insurers have argued that much of the increase reflects the costs of fighting burgeoning -- and, they say, frequently spurious -- personal-injury lawsuits. Between 1981 and 1984, the number of personal-injury suits filed in California rose 6% annually, compared with 4% in state courts nationally, according to a 1986 Rand Corp. study. The study found that contingency fees have been stable nationwide at roughly 30% of awards.    Trial lawyers, however, contend that the insurers' explanation ignores underwriting mistakes and sharply lower investment income that insurers experienced in the early 1980s.    Nonetheless, the public seems to find the fee-cap idea irresistible. Proposition 106 garnered an 80% approval rating in a recent California Poll, a widely followed survey in the state. And it took proponents just a month to collect the more than 500,000 signatures needed to get Proposition 106 on the ballot.    In case voters need further convincing, insurers have lined up a series of blistering TV and radio ads portraying lawyers as rapacious. One radio spot features a John Houseman sound-alike drilling law students on standard fee practices. A student who suggests that a 20% rate might be adequate draws a reprimand. Another student then points out that fees topping 40% are possible under current regulations. &quot;Mr. Whitman, it appears you are going to be a great lawyer after all,&quot; the professor says approvingly.    Lawyers say such advertising is misleading. For one thing, in contingency-fee cases, attorneys receive nothing if they lose. More important, they say reduced fees would cut access to the courts for many people who can't afford to hire a lawyer upfront. They say some lawsuits will be deterred because, without the prospect of large payoffs, attorneys will be unwilling to advance huge pre-trial costs on their clients' behalf.    &quot;There is no lawyer who can handle a complicated case when the fee is just 10%. There has to be some kind of incentive,&quot; says LeRoy Hersh, a San Francisco plaintiffs' attorney. Mr. Hersh, for example, has 70 cases pending on behalf of women who charge they have suffered health problems because their mothers took the anti-miscarriage drug DES. His firm has incurred about $600,000 in costs related to the suits. &quot;I just wouldn't handle those cases any more&quot; if the fee limits were imposed, he says.    But many cases aren't so complicated, insurers say, and lawyers end up getting a windfall just because clients have suffered major injuries. Mr. Katz says the only suits that fee caps would discourage are &quot;nuisance suits,&quot; which insurers say are brought mainly to force a settlement.    &quot;We aren't precluding people from retaining lawyers on a contingency-fee basis,&quot; says Sam Sorich, assistant vice president and western regional manager of the National Association of Independent Insurers, a trade group backing the caps. &quot;We are merely putting a fair schedule of fees before the people and letting them decide what they want to pay.&quot;    Whether such caps are constitutional is another matter. In 1985, the California Supreme Court sustained a law limiting what lawyers in the state could charge in medical malpractice cases. At the time, many doctors were having trouble obtaining malpractice insurance, resulting in a shortage of some medical services. As a result, the court found an overriding public interest in contingency-fee restrictions; the court also found no evidence that limits on fees would disenfranchise potential litigants.    But trial lawyers say the malpractice restrictions, which among other things limit fees to 10% of anything above $200,000, have had a daunting impact. &quot;We are gradually going out of the business,&quot; says Richard Aldrich, a Sherman Oaks, Calif., attorney. Mr. Aldrich says about a third of his cases currently involve medical malpractice claims, compared with 90% before the restrictions.    Stephen Barnett, a professor at the University of California Law School in Berkeley, says the constitutionality of broader fee restrictions partly depends on whether the limits prevent deserving plaintiffs from going to court because they can't find attorneys willing to undertake their cases on a contingency basis.    A few other states have broad limits, but the caps were instituted by judges and aren't as severe as the California proposal. The New Jersey Supreme Court, for instance, has imposed fee restrictions for years, and the limits have been upheld in court challenges. Though New Jersey's limits are considered among the toughest in the U.S., they allow fees about twice as high as California's proposed cap would permit in $1 million cases.    Some New Jersey attorneys have complained that a sliding scale of fees hurts clients because there is less financial incentive for attorneys to push for higher awards. In addition, lawyers say fee restrictions can discourage the filing of suits that use new legal theories. If the California limitations were imposed, &quot;I suspect you would get fewer lawyers to take cases that might make new law,&quot; says Brian Kelly, legislative counsel for the New Jersey State Bar Association. &quot;It could have a chilling effect.&quot;    The California attorneys do have one other hope for defeating the proposed fee caps: Support for the initiatives drops markedly when voters are told that it has the backing of the insurance industry.    The only problem, says California Poll Managing Editor Mark DiCamillo, is that negative attitudes toward insurance companies and trial lawyers seem to be running in a dead heat. &quot;There is no love for either of them,&quot; he says.    ---                 Where the Money Goes   The average expenditures for a tort lawsuit that ended in 1985 totaled about $33,100. The following shows what that money went for.         Plaintiff's Compensation   56%         Plaintiff's Legal Costs    24%         Defendant's Legal Costs    18%         Court Costs                 2%   NOTE: Reflects an average of estimates; excludes value of litigants' time and insurance claims processing.
