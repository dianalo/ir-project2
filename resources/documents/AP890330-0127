After days of unrest and bloodshed in Kosovo province, theofficers were relaxing with their automatic weapons, sniper riflesand tear gas canisters at their sides.   One officer, brought in from outside Kosovo to help quell theriots, recalled how a small police truck was set afire by ethnicAlbanian demonstrators in the village of Suva Reka, 30 miles southof Pristina.   Two policemen managed to jump out of the truck, which wascarrying live ammunition, he said.   The truck eventually exploded, ``killing a few'' demonstratorsand injuring several others ``who had gathered around itcelebrating the victory,'' he said.   All the officers spoke to The Associated Press on condition ofanonymity.   Witnesses, who also demanded anonymity, said in Zur, a villagenear the Albanian border, an unspecified number of demonstratorswere killed or injured Tuesday when a hand grenade they tried totoss at the local police post exploded.   In the provincial capital of Pristina, a bulldozer ran wildTuesday after police shot to death the driver when he tried tocharge a police squadron, said an officer. The bulldozer continuedweaving through the street, smashing parked cars before it hit ahouse and stopped, said the officer.   Protesters used firearms, knives, rocks and bricks in assaultson helmeted riot police, apparently catching them off guard.   A photographer taking shots of riots in Pristina overheard afrantic radio appeal from a police officer to his commander: ``Theyare shooting at us. What shall we do?''   ``If you can't stop them, shoot at their legs,'' the commanderreplied.   Officially, 21 demonstrators and two police officers were killedin the clashes between ethnic Albanians and riot police. At least92 were injured in the unrest, sparked by constitutional changesthe ethnic Albanians fear will curb the province's autonomy.   Ethnic Albanian witnesses said they thought many more peopledied. Yugoslav journalists from other ethnic groups said they alsothought the death toll could be higher.   Witnesses in Pristina described the street battles as ``akin totelevision footage of fighting in Beirut.''</TEXT></DOC>
