Thomas Pickering testified in July 1987 before the Senate SelectCommittee that investigated the Reagan administration's secret armssales to Iran and the subsequent diversion of profits to the Contras.   Pickering told the panel he carried a document provided by aprivate group that planned to provide weapons to the Contras, givingit to then-National Security aide Oliver North.   He said he believed the document discussed a donation or sale ofweapons and equipment with a ``dollar value which was in themillions.''   Pickering was ambassador to El Salvador when he delivered thedocument to North. In his testimony, he said he did not consider hisaction to have violated the Boland Amendment, which at the timeprohibited U.S. aid to the Contras.   He said he did not report his actions through normal StateDepartment channels because of the sensitivity of the privateoperation and he wouldn't have known whom in the department tonotify.   Pickering said he had been contacted by someone representing thegroup and asked if he would help deliver the document. Pickering didnot identify the group in his testimony other than to say it was``engaged either in soliciting or receiving assistance for theContras.''   Pickering told the panel ``the group had information about adonation'' and wanted the document to go to Contra leader AdolfoCalero. Pickering said he delivered the document to North, whosubsequently confirmed receiving it.   Pickering, currently the U.S. ambassador to Israel, was namedTuesday by President-elect George Bush as his U.N. ambassador.   The Washington Post recounted Pickering's Iran-Contra testimonyin an article in its editions today.   Pickering testified that the document contained ``a list ofmilitary equipment ... purported to be available for support of theContras, I think either from a private source or a foreigngovernment source.'' He said he delivered the document to North atthe White House either in December 1984 or early in 1985.   Pickering said during his testimony that he could not recallexactly when Congress had enacted the Boland Amendment, which inOctober 1984 prohibited the U.S. government from aiding the Contrarebels. But he said he believed U.S. officials ``were in completeobservation'' of the amendment because of conversations he had withan official whose name is blacked out in the testimony.</TEXT></DOC>
