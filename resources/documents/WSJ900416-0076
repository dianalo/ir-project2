Friedberg (letters, March 29) accusesBritish historian Paul Johnson of being blind to history whenhe (Mr. Johnson) asserts that we need not fear a unitedGermany. Mr. Friedberg then informs us, &quot;Germans have beenaggressive since they first appeared in history.&quot; Also, heappears to single out West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl'srefusal to guarantee the Oder-Neisse Line as the Polishborder in advance of a peace conference as evidence of Germanaggressive intentions. Perhaps it is Mr. Friedberg who isblind to history.   He gives us no evidence of the aggressive nature ofGermans. Maybe he has in mind World Wars I and II. If so,does he believe history began with the advent of the 20thcentury? Is he not aware that the Soviet Union, as we know ittoday, came about through military conquests? Has he neverheard of Napoleon Bonaparte and his wars of aggression?(Perhaps he was actually a German in disguise.) Who puttogether the largest overseas empire the world has seen ifnot Britain? Or does Mr. Friedberg imagine that the colonialswelcomed British rule? Many more specific examples ofnon-German aggression could be cited. What history tells us,even if it fails to inform Mr. Friedberg, is that everynation in Europe, at one time or another, has warred upon itsneighbors.</LP><TEXT>   Also, Mr. Friedberg, with his knowledge of history, shouldbe aware of why Germans might reasonably object to theOder-Neisse Line as the Polish border. After all, beyond thatline lie territories that have been populated by Germans,governed by Germans, and infused with German customs andculture for 800 years. In contrast, consider that the firstEnglish settlement in what is now the United States wasestablished about 400 years ago. Imagine, for a moment, howwe Americans would feel if all of our lands east of theAppalachian Mountains were confiscated and placed under aforeign government.   But Mr. Friedberg no doubt would say that Germany shouldpay for the destruction and loss of life it caused in WorldWar II, and that is true and that is the purpose ofreparations. The German government has accepted this burdenand paid hundreds of millions of deutsche marks incompensation to both individuals and other governments and iscommitted to paying many millions more in the future. What isgenerally not known is that West Germany has given far morehumanitarian assistance in direct financial grants andin-kind assistance to Poland than any other Western country.And, no doubt, it will pay reparations to Poland and othercountries long after the conclusion of a peace treaty. Buthave a part of its territory confiscated? That is reparationsforever]   It is often said that Adolf Hitler was not born inBraunau, Austria, his natural birthplace, but at Versailles.The Treaty of Versailles humiliated and impoverished theGerman people and laid the groundwork for World War II. Whatis now needed to conclude a just World War II treaty andestablish lasting peace is statesmanship; what we are likelyto get is a political settlement that repeats the errors ofthe past.   Whatever the outcome of peace negotiations, I believe ithighly unlikely that a future conflict will be instigated bythe Germans. Anti-war sentiment in Germany is very strong.But if that unfortunate event should come to pass, a futurehistorian of Mr. Friedberg's insight can again place theblame on German aggression rather than seeking out the rootcauses of the conflict.   Charles A. Auer   Oxford, Ohio   ---   As a West German citizen I am proud of the recentdevelopments in our Eastern brother country and feel veryoffended by Mr. Friedberg's letter. &quot;Vae victis&quot; still seemsto be the motto of this outdated hard-liner.   Anyone seriously versed in European current events iscognizant of the naivete of statements justifying a militarythreat by a reunified Germany toward Europe. Any militarystrategist with only limited insight and experience willinform Mr. Friedberg about the improbability -- theimpossibility -- of conquering Europe with an army of 600,000troops. West Germany, in opposition to suggestions andencouragements from NATO and in particular from the U.S. toincrease the size of its army, is in fact about to reduce thenumber of its troops. It is interesting to note that in thepostwar era the relationship between West Germany and itsNATO partners has strengthened to such an extent that thetrust and confidence implied in a suggestion for militaryincreases supersede any apprehension of a military threat.   With regard to Mr. Friedberg's concern about Germany'smilitary aggressiveness, a quick review of West Germany'smilitary behavior demonstrates nonaggression toward any groupor nation.   It is time for people like Mr. Friedberg to rid themselvesof their archaic/slanted view of the German people and admitto the friendship and political bond that have developedbetween our two nations. The foundation of both ourcountries' constitutions is rooted in democracy, aninalienable freedom that recent history has demonstratedcannot be suppressed.
