REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Industrial nations are pledgingbillions to save this nation's ``fragile'' democracy. But Philippinedemocracy is under siege not only by armed opponents but by forcesof mismanagement and corruption.   Delegates from 25 countries and international organizations,meeting in Tokyo, pledged $3.5 billion for 1989 to be channeled intothe Philippines Multilateral Aid Initiative, a U.S.-initiated planto revive an economy devastated by 20 years of misrule under oustedPresident Ferdinand Marcos.   The figure could reach about $14 billion by 1992. President Bushhas asked Congress for an additional $200 million in annual aid overthe next five years as the American contribution.   But Western diplomats believe President Corazon Aquino'sgovernment must tackle formidable problems if the money is to beeffective.   These include an ill-disciplined military, a cumbersome,inefficient bureaucracy, ineffective courts, and a burgeoningpopulation that threatens economic gains.   Western and Filipino experts give the administration high marksfor restoring business confidence, liberalizing imports, disbandingstate monopolies and removing the tax-exempt status from governmententerprises.   But critics fault Mrs. Aquino for failing to display the vigorousleadership necessary to exploit the opportunities that Filipinosenjoyed after toppling the Marcos administration in February 1986.   Western diplomats say the government has been unable to spendbetween $2 and $4 billion in foreign aid because of inefficiency andbottlenecks in the bureaucracy.   ``There are a number of favorable trends,'' said one Westerndiplomat, on condition of anonymity. ``But they've got a long way togo. The system is fragile.''   Abroad, much attention has focused on the communist New People'sArmy, the rural-based, 23,000-strong force that has waged a 20-yearinsurgency to establish a Marxist state.   Rebels operate in 65 of the 73 provinces and have killed up to 65policemen and soldiers in the Manila area this year.   But the most serious armed threats have come not from theinsurgents but from disaffected members of the military, who havelaunched six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino's government.   Analysts believe the insurgency persists in part because mostFilipinos have not benefited from the promise of economic and socialjustice.   About half the country's 58 million people live below thegovernment's definition of poverty _ on less than the equivalent of$150 a month for a family of six.   Unemployment declined from 9 percent in 1987 to 8.5 percent lastyear, but government figures show that one-third of the labor forceworked less than 40 hours a week.   While most Filipinos struggle economically, there are widespreadrumors of official corruption. True or not, they create theperception that a privileged few benefit from the new administration.   Last year, Mrs. Aquino promised that at least one well-knownpublic figure would be charged with corruption. The promise remainsunfulfilled.   Experts say a major factor holding down living standards is thelack of an effective population control program, a sensitive issuein a Roman Catholic country.   The Asian Development Bank has warned that economic gains in thePhilippines ae threatened by ``a continuing rapid growth in thelabor force.''   The population is growing at about 2.5 percent annually. Thatmeans 750,000 new jobs must be created each year.   In a study, the bank also faulted the administration for the slowpace of land reform, aimed at redistributing property to 3 millionlandless peasants.   The year-old program has virtually ground to a halt because ofscandals in the Department of Agrarian Reform. After delaying forweeks, Mrs. Aquino recently replaced her land reform secretarybecause he authorized purchase of property at grossly inflatedprices.   Public disaffection is also growing over a feared breakdown inlaw and order in Manila after a spate of almost daily policekillings and spectacular bank robberies.   Coupled with this is a growing feeling that with a backlog of300,000 cases in the court system, Filipinos cannot rely on thejustice system to protect their rights.   The government blames communist rebels for most of the policekillings. But last month, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos acknowledgedwidespread criminality in military ranks.   Manila newspapers, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, saidmany of the bank robberies in Manila are carried out by 10 gangs ofsoldiers and former soldiers, who are shielded from arrest by theirofficers.   Few blame Mrs. Aquino personally. But even supporters believethat she must shake off her relaxed, detached style in the face ofintractable problems.   ``The president must now scratch off her slow, gradualist,evolutionary style,'' wrote her former spokesman, Teodoro Benigno.``What is needed for her is to...dare the fates and movedecisively.''</TEXT></DOC>
