On a voice vote, the House Public Works Committee on Thursdaysent a measure to the full House that would force President Bush toname an emergency board to recommend a way to end the 7-day-old workstoppage. Passage by the Democratic-controlled chamber is expectednext week.   Bush opposes such a step, arguing that direct talks between theailing carrier and the striking International Association ofMachinists are the only way to end the 17-month-old impasse. Easternsought protection from its creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in NewYork on Thursday.   Even though the union-sought bill faces an uncertain fate in theSenate _ and the likelihood of a Bush veto _ Democrats say themeasure focuses public attention on the walkout, puts pressure onthe two sides to reach an agreement and might even produce a formulathat would end the dispute.   Some of them also say it could embarrass the president intotaking action.   ``It focuses a very bright light on inexcusable presidentialinaction,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., who is active on laborissues for the House Dmocratic leadership.   The board's suggested solution would be only a recommendation,but lawmakers say it could ultimately be imposed on the airline andits workers in later, separate legislation.   ``If they don't accept it, Congress can act on it and I wouldhave no hesitation on bringing an offer to the committee,'' Rep.James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the Public Works aviationsubcommittee, told the committee before the vote.   Republicans, however, said they believe the bill has littlechance of becoming law. Even if it does, they said, the board woulddo little to bridge the animosity that has been festering betweenthe two sides for years.   ``This is mainly political window-dressing to make it look likeCongress is doing something,'' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.,ranking Republican on the panel, told reporters after the vote. ``Itaccomplishes absolutely nothing.''   The bill also would provide for a cooling-off period of up to 26days while the special board studies the dispute. During that time,rehired workers would receive their pre-strike salaries, whileemployees who are laid off would be entitled to unemploymentbenefits.   An earlier version of the bill would have allowed a cooling-offperiod of up to 60 days. But the panel shortened the time frame,heeding Eastern's arguments that it lacks enough cash to survive atwo-month delay.   The basic dispute, which is over wages and benefits, is betweenEastern and the 8,500-member International Association ofMachinists, but most of the carrier's pilots and flight attendantshave refused to cross picket lines.   The measure would require the emergency board to recommendsolutions to contract disputes between Eastern and its pilots' andflight attendants' unions, which both have expired contracts.   The measure's fate is uncertain in the Senate, where a solitaryopponent can often use procedural delays to kill legislation. Sen.Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Wednesday he would ``oppose any effort''to pass the bill.</TEXT></DOC>
