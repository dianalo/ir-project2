Lehner (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN WNEWS </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> TOKYO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield announced his resignation, putting up for grabs one of the more important and difficult ambassadorial posts President-elect George Bush will have to fill.    Mr. Mansfield, 85 years old, said he would leave Japan before the first of the year, and said in response to a question that no one asked him to resign. He served in Tokyo for more than 11 years, longer than any previous U.S. ambassador here.    Mr. Bush hasn't given any public indication of a possible successor. When Mr. Mansfield underwent surgery earlier this year, speculation about possible successors centered on former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, State Department official Michael Armacost and presidential adviser Gaston Sigur.    Highly regarded by Japanese officials, Mr. Mansfield, a former Senate majority leader, was a strong advocate of close U.S.-Japan ties, often referring to the two countries as having &quot;the most important bilateral relationship bar none.&quot; In a news conference, he said the relationship was &quot;in excellent shape.&quot;    As if anticipating that some mightn't agree, he issued a feisty rejoinder to unnamed Washington critics of Japan's failure to carry more of the military burden in the U.S.-Japan alliance. By North Atlantic Treaty Organization calculations, he said, Japan's defense budget comes to about $41 billion this year, which Mr. Mansfield said is greater than that of Britain, West Germany or France. Japan picks up about 40% of the $6.2 billion annual tab for keeping U.S. forces in Japan, he said.    Mr. Mansfield also defended the two countries' trade relationship, saying Japan will buy $7.6 billion of U.S. agricultural products this year, up from $5.7 billion last year, while the overall U.S. trade deficit with Japan will decline to about $52 billion from $60 billion. He said Japanese investment in the U.S. &quot;is good for our country,&quot; and asked rhetorically why no one complained about British investment in the U.S., which he said is higher in absolute terms and growing faster.    Mr. Mansfield conceded there are Americans who distrust Japan and Japanese who regard America with arrogance, but he insisted that their numbers are few and that they would have little effect on future relations.    Despite Mr. Mansfield's optimism, bilateral tensions over trade, investment and military burden-sharing seem likely to continue or even increase as Japan steps up its challenge to the U.S.'s economic and technological leadership. </TEXT></DOC>
