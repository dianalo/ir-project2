 Both feature advancedgray-scale capabilities and variable resolutions of 100 to 400 dpi, incontrast with the 300-dpi resolution of first-generation models.andM;To make straight scanning easier, the head of the ScanMan Model 32 provides astraight edge, while Thunderware's unit ships with its SnapGuidestraight-scanning accessory.andM;andgt;The LightningScan 400, available now for $495, creates files with 37 levelsof gray and simulates 256 levels of gray through its new ThunderWorkssoftware.andP;  Addressing a major gripe of hand-held scanner users, the softwareincludes a Join feature for merging scanned images into one file.andM;In addition to standard image-editing options, ThunderWorks includes 13preset filters to blur, sharpen, diffuse and despeckle images.andP;  Documents canbe saved in Paint, PICT, four- and eight-bit TIFF, and ThunderScan formats.andM;Registered LightningScan users can upgrade to the new model for $189, whichincludes the new scanning unit, an updated controller and ThunderWorks.andP;  Thesoftware is available separately for $129.andM;andgt;Logitech's ScanMan Model 32, also available now, includes a larger scanningwindow, additional rollers to improve tracking and a light that indicates ifscanning is being done too quickly.andM;Although the $499 ScanMan is a one-bit scanner, it can simulate 32 levels ofgray through its software.andP;  According to Bruce Pocock, marketing manager forMacintosh products at Logitech, gray-scale conversion produces no degradationin image quality.andP;  Because ScanMan offers 400-dpi resolution, it generateshigher-quality screen images and output to 300-dpi laser printers than domany flatbed scanners, he said.andM;ScanMan 2.0 software offers three halftone dithering patterns and a line-artmode.andP;  Images can be saved in Paint, PICT, and one- and eight-bit TIFFformats.andP;  The software includes a desk accessory that offers a quick scanningoption but no printing options.andM;Registered ScanMan users will receive the software upgrade free.andP;  The user'smanual is not included; it can be ordered for $10 plus shipping charges.andM;andgt;Marstek Inc. introduced a 4-inch-wide, 400-dpi hand-held scanner thatemulates 800-dpi resolution.andP;  Scheduled to ship this month for less than$600, the Mars 800 is a monochrome scanner that can simulate 32 levels ofgray with 12 halftone patterns.andM;andgt;Asuka Technologies Inc., formerly Accel Computer Corp., showed the GS 256, a400-dpi, eight-bit gray-scale scanner that captures 256 levels of gray.andP;  Duein June, it will be priced at $599 with a SCSI interface and at $499 with aNuBus-based parallel interface.andP;  Both versions will ship with PhotoPressimage-editing software from Blue Solutions Inc.andM;Asuka also premiered a 400-dpi sheet-fed monochrome scanner.andP;
