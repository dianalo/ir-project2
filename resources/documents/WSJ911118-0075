Xytronyx'sstock lost more than half its value on the news.   Xytronyx said it received a letter from the FDA sayingthat the deficiencies must be resolved before the agency canapprove the test kit for sale in the U.S. It was a stunningblow to the San Diego biotechnology concern, which has saidfor a year or more that it hoped for government approval ofthe PerioGard kit.</LP><TEXT>   Many investors dumped their shares, sending the stockprice plunging to $13.25, down $14.375, in American StockExchange trading. About 673,600 shares changed hands, ornearly 20% of the total 3.4 million shares outstanding. Inrecent months, Xytronyx shares had climbed sharply along withother biotechnology concerns.   Xytronyx said in a statement that it &quot;couldn't predict thenature or extent of data that may be required by the FDA.&quot;The statement said &quot;the process of resubmission andregulatory consideration will require a substantial amount oftime. There can be no assurance that the FDA ultimately willapprove the kit for sale in the U.S. market.&quot;   Larry O. Bymaster, president and chief operating officer,declined to discuss the seriousness of the delay. &quot;We're notentirely clear on what they want. They have raised someobjections; before we indicate what we think they are, weneed to find out exactly what they are.&quot;   An FDA spokeswoman said the letter wasn't a denial of theapplication. She said the contents of the letter to Xytronyxare confidential and that she couldn't discuss theapplication, which was filed in August 1989.   In past statements, Xytronyx has indicated that the FDAhad only minor questions about the PerioGard productapplication. In May 1990, an FDA advisory panel recommendedapproval of the kit for marketing. The following October, theFDA sent a letter seeking additional data which Xytronyx saidconcerned only &quot;recordkeeping&quot; and &quot;modifications of certainlabeling for the kit.&quot;   Mr. Bymaster said the kit includes paper strips that adentist presses against a patient's gums to detect thepresence of decaying or dead cells associated with gumdisease. Bymaster has shipped about 47,500 kits toColgate-Palmolive Co. for sales totaling $281,371, accordingto a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission datedAug. 13, 1991.   A spokeswoman for Colgate-Palmolive, the New York consumerproducts giant, said Friday that &quot;we're continuing todistribute the kits in Europe.&quot; Under terms of a 1987marketing agreement with Xytronyx, Colgate-Palmolive hasinvested about $2 million in Xytronyx in exchange forworld-wide distribution rights to the PerioGard kit.   Xytronyx is a development stage company that wasincorporated in 1983. For the fiscal year ended March 31,Xytronyx reported a net loss of $2.1 million, or 69 cents ashare, on revenue of $263,759.</TEXT></DOC>
