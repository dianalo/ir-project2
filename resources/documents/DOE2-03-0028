The fast reactor, liquid-lithium coolantloops, and lithium-filled heat pipes of the preliminary General ElectricSP-100 design were modeled with ATHENA. Two demonstration transient calculationswere performed simulating accident conditions. Calculated results areavailable for display using the Nuclear Plant Analyzer color graphicsanalysis tool in addition to traditional plots. ATHENA-calculated resultsappear reasonable for both steady state full power conditions, and thetwo transients. This analysis represents the first known transient thermal-hydraulicsimulation using an integral space reactor system model incorporatingheat pipes.</TEXT></DOC>
