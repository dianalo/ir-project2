In this recently initiated study,the author examines both current commercial and possible new sourcesof CO{sub 2} and evaluates their potential to supply the quantities ofCO{sub 2} required for large scale microalgae production. Current commercialsources of CO{sub 2} include concentrated waste streams such as fromfermentation plants and natural gas processing plants and natural reservoirsof nearly pure CO{sub 2}. Possible new sources include flue gas, advancedpower plants and air separation in addition, the author evaluates CO{sub2} transportation costs, the energy requirements and costs of CO{sub2} separation processes, and the impact of potential regulations to controlCO{sub 2} emissions from fossil fuel power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
