One of the four soldiers released Sunday, Sgt. Frantz Beauchard,was accused of being the plot's instigator. The five other accusedsoldiers are believed to have been in hiding since October.   ``The President of the Republic, by this act of clemency towardsthese former members of the Haitian Armed Forces, again shows hisfirm will to safeguard peace, love, and harmony among all Haitianfamilies,'' said a release signed by Information Minister AntonySaint-Pierre and read by state televison on Christmas day.   On Wednesday the government released 12 other soldiers jailed fortheir part in the alleged coup attempt, saying they had beenhoodwinked by the nine leaders of the plot. The 12 releasedWednesday and the four released Sunday had been jailed sincemid-October.   The 21 soldiers have been discharged from the army.   Rank-and-file troops, fed up with state-sponsored violence,ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and replacedhim with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. The soldiers, who also oustednearly 60 unpopular officers, demanded a return to democracy andrespect for human rights.   Several leftist groups, as well as the 12 soldiers releasedWednesday, claimed the soldiers' arrest in October was aimed atpurging the army of its most progressive elements responsible forleading the Sept. 17 rebellion rather than foiling an attempted coup.   Namphy had come to power in 1986 when former dictator Jean-ClaudeDuvalier fled to exile in France.</TEXT></DOC>
