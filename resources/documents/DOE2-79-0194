Clinical disappearance rate accordingto tumor stages following radiotherapy was high in most cases : 100 %for T/sub 1/, 78.6 % for T/sub 2/ and 66.7 % for T/sub 3/, but it wasas low as 13 % for T/sub 4/. Cases in which tumor resolution was achievedby radiotherapy had an overall 5-year survival rate of 35.7 %. Of these,T/sub 1/ and T/sub 2/ cases had a less favorable prognosis than thosetreated by transurethral resection (TUR). T/sub 3/ cases had a relativelygood prognosis with a higher 5-year survival rate than that of casesundergoing total cystectomy. T/sub 4/ cases had a very poor prognosis.From these results it seems that radiotherapy is worth trying in poorrisk, inoperable cases of low stages. In cases of advanced stage, radiotherapyalone can hardly cure the disease. Thus, in these advanced cases, combinedtreatment with some other therapeutic modalities (e.g., surgery) is mandatory.</TEXT></DOC>
