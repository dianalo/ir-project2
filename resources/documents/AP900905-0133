Sherwin and Karen Watkins looked tired and pained as theyentered Manhattan Criminal Court shortly before noon to testifyabout how their son, Brian, was stabbed to death chasing youths whorobbed his father.   The couple, escorted by detectives from the district attorney'soffice, did not speak to reporters.   Mrs. Watkins left the courtroom about 90 minutes later andbought a newspaper to read while her husband testified. Reporterswho tried to speak with her were blocked by a burly man who said,``They don't want to talk to the press.''   The family plans to hold a news conference Thursday afternoonafter their return to Provo, Utah, according to David G. Hansen,the family's Mormon bishop.   Funeral services for Brian Watkins were scheduled for Saturdayin Provo.   On Sunday, the 22-year-old tennis buff, his parents, hisbrother, Todd, and Todd's wife, Michelle, had been at the U.S. Openin Queens and were waiting for a train in a midtown subway stationat around 10:20 p.m. when they were attacked.   The family was approached by a group of youths who sliced openSherwin Watkins' pants and took a money clip containing about $200and some credit cards. One punched Mrs. Watkins in the face.   The brothers interceded and Brian was stabbed, but started togive chase before collapsing. He died 40 minutes later.   The youths robbed the Watkinses because they wanted money to godancing at the nearby Roseland Ballroom, police said.   The grand jury was considering charges of second-degree murderand first-degree assault against eight youths, including Yull GarryMorales, 18, who police accuse of stabbing Watkins.   The eight, who pleaded not guilty at their arraignment, wereordered held without bail. A return court date was set for Friday,said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Manhattan districtattorney.   Besides Morales, the suspects were identified by police asAnthony Anderson, Pascal E. Carpenter, Emiliano Fernandez, RicardoLopez, Johnny Hincapie and Ricardo Nova, all 18, and Luis FernandoMontero, 22.   A double-edged ``butterfly'' knife, believed to have been themurder weapon, was recovered.   The Queens youths belonged to a gang known as FTS _ anabbreviation for an obscene phrase _ which required would-bemembers to mug someone as an initiation rite, the New York Timesreported.   Quoting former members of the gang, the Times said the gangliked to rob people ``for the hell of it'' and had two passions:graffiti and dancing.   A city police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, said howeverthat the group was not known to the department's Youth GangIntelligence Unit. ``We never knew of them as being an organizedgroup. They may have been involved in graffiti in Queens.''</TEXT></DOC>
