Orlando Mercado, majority floor leader, said the Senate isexpected to pass the bill next week on third reading, a formalitywhere the legislators register their votes.   The bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons inthe country, but was amended to allow nuclear-powered vessels tomake port calls after they are inspected by Philippine authorities.   The chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. Wigberto Tanada, is ananti-nuclear activisit and opposes U.S. bases in the Philippines.   Most senators hailed passage of the bill and said it would givePresident Corazon Aquino's administration a stronger hand innegotiating with U.S. officials on the future of Clark Air Base,Subic Naval Base and four smaller U.S. military facilities here.   Sen. Mamintal Tamano, who earlier expressed concern about thebill's implications, said, ``This is a backdoor way of repudiatingthe existing treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines and thetermination of the bases agreement.   ``The Americans will be very uncomfortable with such a law,which will render the bases ineffective.''   Anti-nuclear activists have accused the Americans of using thebases as storage or transit points for nuclear weapons. U.S.authorities have refused to say yes or no.   U.S. policy also is to remain silent on whether a Navy vessel iscarrying nuclear weapons.   On April 5, U.S. and Filipino negotiators started a three-monthreview of the 1947 agreement governing U.S. bases here. Theagreement expires in 1991.   Tanada said his bill ``will strengthen the position of our panelin their negotiations with the U.S.'' A colleague, Sen. ReneSaguisag, said it gives Mrs. Aquino ``a credible option'' on thebases issue.   The president has said she would ``keep her options open'' until1991.   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, an opponent of the bases, said the bill``will send a very strong signal to the world that the Philippinesis an independent nation.''</TEXT></DOC>
