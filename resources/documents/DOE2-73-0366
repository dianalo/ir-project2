The data,obtained at the e/sup +/e/sup -/ collider DCI, are a combination of theresults from the DM1 and DM2 experiments. Using the electron positronand muon plus muon minus production for normalization and cross-checks,we observe a pion pair yield at low invariant mass (Wandless;500 MeV/c/sup 2/)which is approximately twice the one expected from the Born terms.</TEXT></DOC>
