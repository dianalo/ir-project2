(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bomb-sniffing dogs and dozens ofpolice provided security today at the funeral of a federal judgekilled by a parcel bomb in a wave of attacks that may have beencarried out by white racists.   More than 700 mourners, including Attorney General DickThornburgh and FBI Director William S. Sessions, filled a suburbanchurch for the service in memory of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance.   Vance was a man ``who stood up for the underdog and theoppressed,'' his friend U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford ofBirmingham told mourners. ``No wonder his assassins could not standsuch a man in their presence.''   The 58-year-old Vance was killed by a package bomb Saturday. FBIagents say the bomb and three others, including the one that killedSavannah, Ga., lawyer Robert Robinson, 42, on Monday, all boreGeorgia return addresses or postmarks.   Links to NAACP school desegregation efforts have beenestablished in all four cases, leading investigators to speculatethat a white racist group may be responsible. After police defuseda bomb at an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla., Tuesday, theorganization placed all its offices on alert.   Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war onvarious federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to thebombings, FBI spokesman Greg Jones said today in Washington.   St. Luke's Episcopal Church, in a quiet area of this wooded,exclusive suburb of Birmingham, was surrounded by police barriersas part of security precautions that included bomb searches andguards.   Among those attending was Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy,who oversees Vance's appellate circuit. Vance's wife, Helen,remained hospitalized from wounds received in the bombing.   Family friends said Vance's body had been cremated and his asheswill be placed in the church.   In Baltimore today, NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks saidthe attacks will not prevent the NAACP from ``moving forward fullspeed ahead on the job of trying to make America a place of equaljustice for all.''   ``I think it's the work of white supremacists without anyquestion. I think it reveals the derangement, demented, criminallystupid minds,'' Hooks said.   Hooks said he had been assured by Sessions and Thornburgh thatthe bombings were being given the highest priority.   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, toldThe Birmingham News in an interview published today that the deadlypackage addressed to Vance was mailed Thursday from Newnan, a townof about 11,500 people 30 miles southwest of Atlanta.   The bomb that killed Robinson on Monday is believed to have beenmailed Friday from Macon, 82 miles southeast of Atlanta, Hinshawsaid, but the postmark was destroyed in the blast.   The Atlanta Constitution quoted unidentified sources as sayingit bore a return address in Warner Robins, a town near Macon.   The bomb found Tuesday in Jacksonville also was mailed Fridayfrom Macon, Hinshaw said. A Jacksonville NAACP official, Lloyd N.Pearson, told the Macon Telegraph and News the package bore thereturn address of a Warner Robins lawyer.   Another device was mailed Saturday from the Atlanta area to the11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals clerk's office in Atlanta,Hinshaw said, and the Constitution reported it bore the returnaddress of an Atlanta lawyer. The court, on which Vance served,handled appeals of federal cases from Georgia, Alabama and Florida.   That bomb was removed safely. All four bombs reportedly weredesigned to hurl nails or shrapnel.   Sessions told reporters that some organized group could beresponsible for the bombs. He said a pattern of racist attacks``has to be one of the factors in the back of all our minds.''   ``Common sense would tell you _ the number of incidents ... inthree different states, all part of the 11th Circuit. It's quitepossible there is more than one (person responsible),'' Sessionssaid.   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Associationfor the Advancement of Colored People, said he believed anorganized group was behind the attacks. He instructed the civilrights group's 1,800 offices to take precautions in handling mail.   Hooks also said he fears the bombings were the beginning of awave of attacks: ``The thing has come to the place where everyonemay be in jeopardy, from the president on down.''   One possible link between the cases was the NAACP's efforts todesegregate Southern schools, authorities said. Evidence included:   _Vance wrote the 11th Circuit's unanimous opinion three monthsago that ruled in favor of the NAACP in a desegregation suitagainst the Jacksonville, Fla., schools.   _Robinson, a black city alderman, represented the NAACP inanother desegregation case involving Savannah area schools. OnSept. 29, an 11th Circuit panel that didn't include Vance upheld adesegregation plan opposed by the NAACP.   _The Jacksonsville NAACP chapter talked with Robinson about itsdesegregation case, but Robinson did not represent them. ``He gaveus some advice,'' said the Rev. Fred Newbill, pastor of the FirstTimothy Baptist Church.   Vance and Robinson shared a moderate-to-progressive politicalstance and an interest in civil rights, but friends of the twobelieved they had never met.</TEXT></DOC>
