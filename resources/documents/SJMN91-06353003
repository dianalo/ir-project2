You may be wondering if you saw the one set up Saturday night onHamilton Avenue near Bascom Avenue by Campbell police and the CaliforniaHighway Patrol. Signs warned eastbound Hamilton traffic of the impendingsobriety inspection and lane closures well in advance of the Highway 17interchange, giving drivers a chance to turn off onto 17 or onto Creekside Wayinstead of going through the checkpoint. &quot;Yes, drivers could turn off,&quot; agreesCampbell Police Chief Jim Cost. &quot;We have to offer a reasonable way around thecheckpoints for motorists who don't want to be delayed, in accordance with thecourt guidelines permitting such checkpoints. But the main point anyway isjust to make people aware that we're out there and that drunken driving won'tbe tolerated.&quot; Maybe so, but you have to wonder about a checkpoint that mightencourage drinking drivers -- the ones still sober enough to notice signs --to turn onto a freeway. The people we don't have to worry about -- for awhile, at least -- are the nine drivers who were so drunk that night theydrove right into the checkpoint anyway and were arrested.;   DOWNTOWN, UPTOWN-- New on the downtown San Jose scene: Cat's Alley, a remake by the D.B.Cooper's Oliver clan of the old Dugout bar on Post Street, where karaokesinging is the theme (with jazz thrush Gail Dobson joining Eric Togami theretonight to show the amateur vocalists how). And Bill Carlson has leased 58 S.First St. for an S.J. version of his popular Saratoga restaurant, Bella Mia,expected to open next September. &quot;We're bursting at the seams in Saratoga,&quot;Carlson explains. &quot;This will give us space for major banquets and corporatecatering, as well as 'intimate dining for 600.' &quot; Also reportedly in theworks: downtown's first bed-and-breakfast inn. . . . The De Anza Hotel onTuesday named its five parlor suites in honor of local performing arts groups:Opera San Jose, Civic Light Opera, San Jose Cleveland Ballet, San JoseRepertory Theatre and San Jose Symphony. The hotel says it'll donate apercentage of the room revenue to the groups as part of an &quot;Encore at the DeAnza&quot; package. And downstairs in the hotel's lounge, David Dumont and his Li'lBig Band got an early Christmas present: an extension of their Friday nightperformance contract through April. . . . Hard to believe the S.J. Fairmontdoesn't have a barber and beauty salon, but that'll change Jan. 2 when MarkGomez and Carmen Goldston open up there as M.G. for Hair. Previously inbusiness with the John Marks salon on South Second Street, they come inbearing recommendations from a couple of regulars -- Rep. Norm Mineta andstate Sen. Al Alquist.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MAKING IT EASY TO STEER CLEAR OF SOBRIETY CHECKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     THE CLASSICS -- Can we do anything to encourage San Jose Rep to bring back&quot;The 1940's Radio Hour&quot; every Christmas? Its current production is every bitas good as the first time it was presented here in 1988 -- perfect casting(ingenue Dawn Marie Church and crooner James Clow are especially good),perfect direction, perfect execution -- and if the Rep can pull off thatclassy a repeat, it could become a perennial, another &quot;Nutcracker.&quot; It alsowould make it a lot easier for more people to get tickets; this year's arealmost gone as you read this. . . . You can expect to see El TeatroCampesino's television version of &quot;La Pastorela&quot; again and again. PBS willcontinue to broadcast it as part of the &quot;Great Performances&quot; series, of course-- but El Teatro's Luis Valdez also was smart enough to get the videocassetterights.;   SMILE -- KARA-FM's Kim Vestal had to grin over the Christmasmessage she spotted on the office window of Los Gatos dentists Mary Turoff andRandall Partin: &quot;Floss Navidad.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Leigh Weimers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911218  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  644  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 18, 199100353003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
