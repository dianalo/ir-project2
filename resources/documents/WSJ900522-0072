How about the Camel Supercross motorcycle race,aired on ESPN?   For legislators attempting to crack down on tobaccoadvertising, the answer is an unqualified yes. And now, atleast one legislator is taking on the televised car, bike andtruck races as part of a crusade to curb tobacco advertising.</LP><TEXT>   Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D., Ohio), an outspoken tobaccogadfly and a sponsor of a bill restricting tobaccoadvertising, plans to launch an investigation into thetelevised races today, an aide says. In letters being sent tothe three major networks and ESPN, among others, Mr. Lukenasks for details of their financial relationships withtobacco companies, in order &quot;to understand the extent towhich television sports events are in fact sponsored bytobacco companies.&quot;   Tobacco foes have long complained about tobacco companies'sports sponsorships, saying the sponsorships are in factback-door tactics to circumvent a 20-year-old television adban. Tobacco ads on scoreboards and billboards in stadiumsare frequent targets of legislators and other anti-tobaccoactivists.   But the critics' complaints so far have had only marginalresults, which may be why they are turning to motor sports.Televised motor races are far more obvious in flaunting theirsponsors, whose names tend to be plastered across racingcars, helmets, and everything else in camera view. Accordingto the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardousmaterials, of which Mr. Luken is chairman, a Camel logo wasvisible 30% of the time on the ESPN-aired Camel Supercross,an indoor motorcycle race. The Marlboro logo was shown 49% ofthe time during the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix, according toMr. Luken's letter.   &quot;This isn't just a baseball stadium where you occasionallysee something. This is serious business. It's a matter ofdegree,&quot; says Benjamin Cohen, the Luken aide. He notes thatcar races frequently include a camera stationed inside one ofthe race cars, and that a tobacco logo often appears on thedashboard. &quot;These things don't happen by chance,&quot; he says.&quot;They happen because people are signing contracts and payingmoney.&quot;   Mr. Luken's initiative comes at a time when publicsentiment has clearly turned against smoking. A powerfultobacco lobby was unable to prevent Congress last year fromoutlawing smoking on most domestic airline flights. More thana dozen bills limiting tobacco in some way are pending onCapitol Hill right now, including Mr. Luken's initiative,which would ban all sports sponsorships and allow onlyall-text print ads for tobacco products. Next month, Rep.Henry Waxman (D., Calif) is expected to introduce yet anotherbill, this time one incorporating parts of the various billsalready pending.   Tobacco companies, for their part, contend that sponsoringtelevised races and race cars isn't advertising at all. &quot;It'spromotion of our product, just like the Virginia Slims TennisTournament is,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, makerof Marlboro, among other brands. She adds that &quot;there is noagreement&quot; with the networks under which they are required toshow the company's logo during races -- although when thelogo is plastered all over the car and its driver, it wouldbe difficult not to show it.   In fact, the spokeswoman says, during the Indy 500, PhilipMorris didn't allow an ABC camera in a car with a Marlborologo on the dashboard. &quot;We didn't want the camera to befocused on the logo,&quot; she says. &quot;The law is that there is notelevision advertising, and we adhere to the law.&quot;   At NBC, Richard Gitter, vice president of standards andpractices, says that tobacco sponsorships of motor races&quot;isn't advertising that is the kind of advertisingcontemplated -- and barred -- by the Federal CigaretteLabeling and Advertising Act.&quot; Mr. Gitter declined comment onthe letter, as he hadn't received it.   Another recipient of the letter is to be Charles Mancuso,president of SRO/Pace Promotions, a Lombard, Ill., firm thatproduces motor sports events, including the Camel Supercross.Mr. Mancuso declined comment on the letter, which he alsohadn't received. He added that he didn't know of anyrelationship between the tobacco companies and the networksthat air their races.   ---   Chiat Shop Buy-Out                                                                                                          Chiat/Day/Mojo said it plans to sell a majority interestof its San Francisco office to a group of employees at theoffice, including its president and chief executive, FredGoldberg.
