But Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, who introduced the legislationFriday, said at a news conference that even if railroad unionsdecide not to support the bill, ``We'll continue to forge ahead.''   Congress has been focusing on drug and alcohol abuse bytransportation workers ever since the Jan. 4, 1987, collisionbetween an Amtrak passenger train and linked Conrail locomotives inChase, Md. Sixteen people were killed and 175 hurt in the accident,in which Conrail crewmen have admitted they were smoking marijuanashortly before the wreck.   But bills that would require random drug testing have beenbogged down, with labor and other opponents arguing that suchprocedures violate the right of privacy and leave employeesvulnerable to harassment and incorrect test results that couldthreaten their careers.   Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce transportationsubcommittee, has been among those arguing that laboratory testsare so unreliable that large numbers of workers should not besubjected to tests.   He pointed Friday, however, to evidence of accidents caused bydrug and alcohol abuse and said, ``We do have a great demand forthis kind of thing.''   On April 25, Dr. Roger Horn of Hunt Valley, Md., whose daughterCeres, 16, was killed in the Chase accident, visited television andradio stations and newspapers in Luken's Cincinnati district andargued that a random testing bill was needed. Horn is a member ofSafe Travel America, a group of relatives and friends of thecrash's victims who have lobbied for such legislation on CapitolHill.   Many railroad union officials have also dropped their outrightopposition to random testing and now say they are willing to try tohelp craft Luken's legislation.   Lawrence L. Mann, attorney for the Railway Labor Executives'Association, which represents rail unions, said labor officialslike the protections Luken put in his bill, but are still concernedthat the testing would be an invasion of privacy.   ``We're not going to push this bill,'' he said after Luken'snews conference. ``We're going to try to improve it.''   The legislation would give the Department of Transportation 90days to set up procedures for administering the tests.   Workers testing positive would be suspended and required toundergo rehabilitation programs. They would be given their jobsback after successfully completing the treatment.   The bill establishes a series of requirements designed toprotect workers against inaccurate test results and to protect themfrom harassment. It also sets penalties for falsifying results andavoiding testing by leaving accident scenes.   ``This strikes a fair balance between protecting the public fromthe lethal threat of drug use by railroad personnel and affordingthe drug abuser human treatment that allows him a real opportunityto put his life in order again,'' said the subcommittee's rankingRepublican, Rep. Bob Whittaker of Kansas, who appeared with Luken.   The measure would also require testing after accidents, beforehiring, for reasonable cause and as part of annual physicalexaminations.   On May 5, the Federal Railroad Administration proposed rulesthat would require railroads to randomly test many of theiremployees for drugs, but not alcohol. The government alreadyrequires drug and alcohol testing for employees involved inaccidents, but the constitutionality of those rules has beenchallenged in federal court.</TEXT></DOC>
