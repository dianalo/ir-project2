Three journalists were among those killed.   The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than50 percent of the vote _ enough to avoid a runoff election nextmonth against the incumbent Christian Democrats.   ``We are sure and we proclaim ourselves the victors,'' RobertoD'Aubuisson, founder of Arena, told a news conference.   Arena presidential candidate Alfredo Cristiani said the party hadresults from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured ofvictory.   The U.S. Embassy, which surveyed 21 polling places in SanSalvador that it considered would predict results for the entirecity, found Arena getting 60.5 percent, the Christian Democrats 31.7percent, and the leftist Democratic Convergence 5.7 percent.   ``Is it now quite possible that Arena is headed for a first-roundvictory,'' the embassy said in a cable addressed to Secretary ofState James A. Baker III that was obtained by The Associated Press.The document, which cited no raw vote figures, predicted turnoutwould be 58 percent.   Election authorities said preliminary official results wereexpected Monday.   A rebel boycott and scattered firefights between guerrillas andtroops trimmed the voter turnout.   Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as therebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. Emilio Ponce,chief of the joint chiefs of staff.   Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman alsowere killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the othersat military checkpoints.   Christian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena had said heexpected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, buthis party's headquarters was virtually deserted Sunday night and theparty provided no results.   ``We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assureyou there will be no second round,'' said D'Aubuisson. ``I am proudto have been able to carry such a good and capable man as FreddyCristiani to the presidency.''   Critics claim Arena is still controlled by D'Aubuisson, a formerarmy major who has been accused of having links with rightist deathsquads. D'Aubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations.   There was no official word on turnout, but a spot check ofseveral polling places in San Salvador showed about 60 percent ofregistered voters cast ballots.   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel spokeswoman in Mexico City, saidenough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that noelection could be held without participation by the rebel FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front.   She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as theguerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on governmentinstallations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls.   The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotagedtelephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80percent of the country.   Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipersand by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations inSan Salvador. Turnout was light in many smaller towns.   ``With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said JoseCarlos Ortiz, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital asguerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocksaway.   Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano,a guerrilla stronghold north of San Salvador, as troops foughtinsurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated70,000 lives.   There were seven presidential candidates and the three major oneswere Cristiani, Chavez Mena and Guillermo Ungo of the DemocraticConvergence.   Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte's five-yearterm ends June 1. Duarte, barred by law from running forre-election, is dying of liver cancer.   Cristiani has vowed to follow free-market policies and reducestate intervention in the economy. His party promised to step up thewar if the guerrillas do not agree to lay down their arms.   Chavez Mena, a lawyer, heads the Christian Democrats'conservative wing. He struggled against opposition charges ofcorruption in the U.S.-backed government and inability of his partyto deal with the economy and the civil war.   Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links withthe guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in whichsocialist candidates have competed.   About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million wereeligible to vote and polls were open in 243 of the country's 262municipalities. Nineteen towns in the north did not set up votingstations because election officials deemed those rebel-held zonestoo dangerous.   In San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light.   ``The people are frightened,'' said William Doherty of theAmerican AFL-CIO. ``There is no question that the intimidation bythe (guerrillas) is working.''   Doherty is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and privatecitizens named by the White House to be official election observers.He said turnout was ``far less'' than during three previouselections he attended this decade.   Cornel Lagrouw, a cameraman for Dutch national television, waskilled as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the easterntown of San Francisco Javier, said Bill Gentile, a U.S. photographerfor Newsweek.   Lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two driverswho were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in twocars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite pressmarkings and white flags on the vehicles, Gentile said.   Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriouslywounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armedforces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks.   In the March 1988 elections for the National Assembly, Arena won32 seats, the Christian Democrats 23 and the National ConciliationParty six. But a group called the Authentic Christian Movement splitfrom the Christian Democrats, taking 16 seats from Duarte's faction.The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
