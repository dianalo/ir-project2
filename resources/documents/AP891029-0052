Elsewhere Sunday, the 30 residents of the West Bank Jewishsettlement of Beit Haggi near Hebron moved into permanent homes,built with help from the Ministry of Housing, after living intrailers for five years.   Israel radio said the trailers would be used to house moresettlers.   Washington has repeatedly criticized Israel's policy ofexpanding Jewish settlements in occupied territory, saying it is anobstacle to the U.S. formula of trading land for peace.   One Beit Haggi settler, Nurit Hadad, told The Associated Pressby telephone that she believed settlements would grow despite thePalestinian ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, against Israeli occupation.   ``The intefadeh is part of our lives,'' she said. ``If we throwup our hands now, we will have to throw up our hands for the restof our lives.''   More than 70,000 Israelis live in 133 Jewish settlements amongthe 1.7 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which wereoccupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.   At least 606 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops orcivilians during the uprising that began in December 1987. FortyIsraelis have died in the violence, and 137 other Palestinians havebeen killed by fellow Arabs for allegedly collaborating with Israel.   Most of the shooting injuries Sunday occurred in the Gaza Strip,but two teen-agers were also wounded in the West Bank cities ofNablus and Tulkarem, Arab reports said. The army said it waschecking the reports.   Sunday's general strike was called by both the PLO-backedleadership of the uprising and the Islamic fundamantalist movementHamas.   The PLO-backed leaders ordered the action to protest Israel'splan for elections in the occupied territories. Hamas urged thestrike to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Israeli army's slayingof 46 Palestinians in the village of Kfar Qassem.   The mass slaying occurred when farmers, not realizing a curfewhad been declared, were gunned down by soldiers as they returnedhome from the fields. The curfew was in effect because of the startof the 1956 invasion of Egypt by Israeli, British and French troops.   Also Sunday, Jerusalem police arrested a 12-year-old Palestinianboy in the Arab neighborhood of Beit Safafa and accused him ofpossessing three firebombs, two bottles of gasoline, 13 masks andtwo outlawed Palestinian flags.   ``The kid was guarding the stuff. Apparently there were moreyouths, but they escaped,'' said Jerusalem police spokesman UziSandori. He said more arrests were expected in the case.   The boy, whose name was not released, was ordered by a judge tobe held 48 hours for questioning, Sandori said.   Beit Safafa, a village within Jerusalem that was once divided bythe Israeli-Jordanian border, has been the scene of stoning andfirebomb attacks on Israeli motorists.   The Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodorus I, wasallowed to enter Beit Sahour on Sunday to say prayers for peace twodays after he and two other church leaders were blocked by the armyfrom entering the Christian Arab town.   Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem, has been sealed off for more than amonth by the army because many of its 10,000 residents have refusedto pay Israeli taxes as part of the uprising.   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, soldiers arrested 12 suspectedmembers of an outlawed ``popular committee,'' an enforcing arm ofthe Palestinian uprising's underground leadership, militaryofficials said.   They said the arrests were made Saturday. They said theactivists belong to Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of thePLO.   ``The operation was carried out at the heart of Jabalya refugeecamp where people are very much exposed to the influence of maskedactivists. The group is large and organized, and the performance ofthe forces was very good, without fire,'' an officier identifiedonly as Col. G. said on Israel Television.</TEXT></DOC>
