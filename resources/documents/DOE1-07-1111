Allmetallic parts of the SED are made of 12Kh18N10T stainless steel. Theobtained data testify to the absence of the symmetry in volt-ampere characteristicof the SED with plane electrodes with respect to the value at zero potential.This is conditioned by the contribution of slow secondary electrons emittedby the inner surface of side body wall. Volt-ampere characteristics ofthe SED with spherical electrodes are practically symmetrical with respectto the value at zero potential. This is conditioned by the fact thatthe system of congruent electrodes is characterized by a closed form.Such a form causes the reduction of electric field in interelectrodegap: volt-ampere characteristic achieves saturation at higher potentialdifference between electrodes sensitivity of the SED with spherical electrodesdoesn't depend on the direction of {gamma}-radiation propagation. Itis concluded that decrease of fast secondary electron contribution tothe signal of SED with spherical electrodes enables to improve sufficientlythe accuracy of determining dose rate of {gamma}-radiation with incertainspatial and angular and energy distributions as compared to the SED withplane-parallel electrodes.</TEXT></DOC>
