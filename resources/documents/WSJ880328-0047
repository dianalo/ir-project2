Moog, which designs, makes and markets industrial and aerospace equipment, said it expects to sign a contract with Hercules in the near future with an estimated value of more than $40 million.    Moog said it received authorization from Hercules -- a subcontractor of Denver-based Martin Marietta Corp. -- to proceed with development and qualification of production systems for the program to upgrade the Titan IV's solid rocket engine.    Qualification of Moog hardware for the solid-propellant strap-on boosters of the Titan IV is expected in 1989. The Air Force currently plans to purchase over the next five years 50 Titan IV vehicles to launch satellites and spacecraft. </TEXT></DOC>
