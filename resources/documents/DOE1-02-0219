From 1978 to the presentthe growth rate has been about 17%. Most of the increase has been dueto power plant activity in three countries: the Philippines, the US,and Mexico. If that rate of growth were to continue, then there wouldbe about 10,000 MW of geothermal power on-line by the end of this decade.However, there are indications that a significantly lower growth ratewill take hold for at least the next five years. A summary is given ofthe present status (i.e., through 1985) and projected developments outto the year 1994 for those countries that now have operating plants andthose that might reasonably be expected to have plants during the next10 years. Based on information available at this time, the cumulativepotential geothermal power capacity is about 10,114 MW. It seems likelythat an annual growth rate of about 6% will apply for the rest of the1980s. The rate could increase in the 1990s should the Philippines resumetheir initial rapid development of their impressive geothermal resources.This paper focuses on geothermal power plant activities in the followingcountries: the US, Mexico, Japan, New Zealand, Nicaragua, and Indonesia.2 references, 6 figures, 14 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
