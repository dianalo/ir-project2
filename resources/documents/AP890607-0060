(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sixty-nine years after women won the right tovote, they are on their way to winning potty parity, thanks tolawmakers in the state's Senate.   The Republican-controlled Senate on Tuesday approved a bill thatrequires buildings constructed after June 1, 1990, to have the samenumber of toilets for women as men.   That's to correct an age-old inequity when it comes to bathrooms,according to the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Guy Velella.   Current New York state law allows men to have more toilets thanwomen, and that's a ``gender-based inconvenience'' and a potentialhealth hazard, Velella said.   Besides, women take longer than men, so they should have at leastas many stalls in public restrooms, Velella said.   The bill passed 40-1. Velella's bill probably won't make it intolaw this year. As of Tuesday, there was no similar bill in theAssembly.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTONVILLE, N.Y.

A shipment of about 35,000 cases of what is called the first winemade from New York grapes and the famed Oriental root was to be sentto Taiwan today, Brotherhood's master winemaker Cesar Baeza saidTuesday.   Baeza said Sonny Lee, a Korean businessman who moved to New York,asked him what could be done with ginseng, touted for itsrestorative and aphrodisiac powers.   Baeza, who began working at the 150-year-old winery two yearsago, already had experimented with ginseng during his 10 years as aresearcher for Pepsico Inc.'s wine and spirits division.   The wine Baeza developed is being marketed in the United Statesunder the name Genghis Khan and comes in two brands, Red Label, with12 percent alcohol content, and Black Label, with 18 percentalcohol. He and Lee are partners.   The wine is marketed in Taiwan under Brotherhood's brand name,Baeza said. It also was made available to American retailers earlyin May, he said.   ``It's a good combination of a very Oriental flavor and aromawith a very characteristic New York taste,'' Baeza said.</TEXT><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Representatives from 29 villages, towns and citiesaround the world named Newark will gather this week in New Jersey,including representatives from Newark, Mich., a town that no longerexists.
