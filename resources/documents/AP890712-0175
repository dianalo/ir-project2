The Western cooperation, however, was unlikely to amount to muchmore than a show of support for a nation undergoing enormouspolitical change.   Peter Pietsch, senior economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, WestGermany, said the question was whether the assistance would be ``bigenough to really help to overcome its problems.''   ``I think Poland will not be feeling satisfied about what iscoming out,'' said Pietsch.   Bush and the leaders of Canada, West Germany, France, Italy,Britain and Japan on Friday will hold their first round ofdiscussions at the economic summit in Paris. The annual gatheringgives its participants a chance to discuss not only the health oftheir economies but any pressing political issues as well.   With the enormous, unexpected changes under way in EasternEurope, the summit leaders were expected to devote some of theirtime to ways of encouraging democratic reforms there. Bush will givethe leaders his first-hand impressions after winding up a tripthrough Poland and Hungary.   In Warsaw, the president said he would ask Congress for a $100million ``enterprise fund'' to support private entrepreneurs inPoland. Bush said he would encourage his summit participants to setup similar programs.   In Budapest, Bush offered American help to Hungary as well,including a promise to seek most-favored-nation trading status,which would allow liberal terms for Hungarian exports, and a $25million grant to spur the fledgling free-enterprise system.   As part of the aid package for Poland, Bush promised to seeksupport for ``an early and generous'' rescheduling by Westerncreditor governments of some of Poland's foreign debt, a burdensome$39 billion. Bush said such a move could amount to deferral of about$5 billion in payments this year.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher earlier told Poland'sCommunist Party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, that she wouldplay a key role in trying to get some payments of the nation'sforeign debt delayed.   France agreed last month to restructure about $1.2 billion inPolish debt and provide new bank loans of nearly $100 million. WestGermany will stretch out payments on about $1.3 billion of loansowed by Poland.   The British government set up a $38.7 million ``know-how'' fundfor Poland during Jaruzelski's June visit to London. The five-yearprogram is designed to train Poles to run a more market-orientedeconomy.   Mrs. Thatcher opposes new loans to Poland unless they areaccompanied by a stringent economic program backed by theInternational Monetary Fund, the 151-nation lending agency thatprovides help to financially strapped nations.   In granting loans, the IMF usually wants the countries to takemeasures to slash high inflation rates, halt the outflow of badlyneeded capital, bolster weak currencies and, in general, take a moremarket-oriented approach in managing their economies.   British officials say the Poles have already gone through a heftyamount of foreign credit without making basic changes in thestructure of the economy.   ``There's a growing re-realization that for all these debtorcountries there's no substitute for getting them to tackle thecentral structural problem,'' said a senior British official,demanding anonymity.   ``The problems have to be solved there,'' added Pietsch.   Poland's economy is beset by high inflation, shortages of meatand other food products and a rush by workers to find jobs elsewhere.   Western European countries, acting through the EuropeanCommunity, have stepped up efforts to increase their economic andtrade links with Poland and other Eastern European countries. Fourof the summit nations _ Germany, Britain, France and Italy _ aremembers of the 12-nation trading bloc, also known as the CommonMarket.   In June 1988, the Common Market signed a declaration establishingofficial relations with the Soviet-led socialist economic bloc,called the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The landmarkdeclaration ended three decades of estrangement between Europe'seconomic halves.   Since then, the community has signed a trade and cooperationagreement with Hungary and is close to winding up an agreement withPoland.   Japan, too, has indicated a willingness to assist Poland.   ``Although Japan's relationship with the East bloc nations isweaker than that of the United States and European countries, we areready to play an appropriate role to help them,'' said a ForeignMinistry official in Tokyo.   Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters Japan wouldpledge to eliminate or reduce tariffs on goods it imports fromPoland.   According to Japanese press reports, the government also wasprepared to offer untied bank loans through its Export-Import Bankto back up Poland's economic and political reforms.   On Wednseday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said heexpected there would be support for a package of aid to rewardPoland and Hungary.   Asked if the United States expected wealthy nations such as Japanand West Germany to shoulder a larger part of the burden, Bakerreplied, ``Some countries are in a better position to contributethan other countries are.''   Meanwhile, the official Polish news agency, PAP, on Wednesdayreleased part of a letter from Jaruzelski to French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand proposing a six-point aid plan for Poland, whichincludes:   _$1 billion over two years in supplies and credit guarantees tobuild up food reserves to enable introduction of a market-orientedfood economy.   _$2 billion in credits from the International Monetary Fund undera negotiated adjustment program to last until 1992.   _Quick debt rescheduling by the Paris Club for government togovernment loans of Poland's $39 billion foreign debt.   _Rolling back some of Poland's non-government-guaranteed debt andtransforming a portion into other forms of obligations, such asequity in Polish enterprises.   _$300 million in World Bank credits to finance export-orientedinvestments and a $500 million structural adjustment loan to helpimprove Polish exports. The money would be coupled with improvementof access of Polish goods to Western markets.   _$500 million from the World Bank or European Investment Bankover three years to finance food processing and storage facilityimprovements, giving Poland the infrastructure it lacks to marketagricultural products abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
