Mining-related studies inthis area are, in general, limited. They are also mostly experimental.Some mathematical and computer analyses have been attempted. In thispaper, first, a review of the mathematical studies performed in the lastthree decades in this area is presented. Second, a mathematical modelfor analyzing dust flow in mines is proposed. The model takes into accounta number of factors affecting dust transport. It incorporates varyingdust generation source strengths and dispersion, deposition, and coagulationof dust in mine airways. Finally, application areas for the model arediscussed. A computer program based on the mathematical model has beendeveloped. The program will output the dust concentration in the mineatmosphere as a function of time and distance from the source. The amountof dust deposited on the sides, roof, and floor of the airway is alsodetermined.</TEXT></DOC>
