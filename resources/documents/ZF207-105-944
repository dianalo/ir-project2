 You would also have access to a commonpublic telecommunications network capable of handling all types ofinformation, such as voice, text, data, video, at whatever speed.andM;This is the information network of the future.andM;Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a major step towardestablishing a telecommunications network of this type.andP;  Information networksof the future will only slightly resemble the telecommunications facilitiesof today.andP;  They will be completely digital; all switching, transmission andnetwork control will be governed by computers, and the networks themselveswill have enough intelligence built into them to handle anything from themost complex routing and diagnostic problems to protocol conversion andsoftware emulation.andM;Many transmission systems will use fiber-optic cables, rather than copperwires, due to their capacity to transmit huge quantities of information,including television and video.andP;  However, the biggest breakthrough of futureinformation networks will be the ability to provide all of these facilitiesand more, not as enhanced services requiring special circuits and equipment,but as standard network services available to all users on demand.andM;To provide this level of service, existing telecommunications networks willhave to undergo fundamental and rapid change and make full use of techniquesonly now reaching their early stages of development (for example, opticaltransmission at speeds of hundreds of millions of bits per second).andP;  One ofthe biggest obstacles in the progress toward this information network of thefuture is not technology, but the creation and application of a framework ofeffective international standards that will promote development of thesenetworks on a truly global basis.andM;Some aspects of this information network, however, are already in place.andO;Many countries around the world are rapidly replacing much of their existinganalog switching and transmission systems to digital, computer-controlledsystems.andM;In the United States, Japan and much of Europe, this process has been underway for many years.andP;  Many networks that use digital switching and interofficetransmission still provide, essentially, an analog telecommunications serviceto most of their customers.andM;Corporations have been the first to benefit from conversion to digital.andP;  Viaeither satellites or more conventional terrestrial circuits, large corporateusers can make use of digital, point-to-point circuits for voice, data orvideo.andM;Over the past few years, a host of new networks and services has becomeavailable, some based on existing equipment and technologies, others on newtechnologies.andP;  It is only now, however, that we are beginning to seesubstantial progress in the area of a single, common network capable ofhandling all of our information needs.andM;An ISDN network has a number of basic operational characteristics.andP;  First, asshown in the accompanying figure, most users of the network will have a''telephone line'' capable of transmitting at a speed of 144K bits per second(bps).andM;The 144K-bps path is divided into three separate channels, two which operateat 64K bps and can be used to transmit information, and a separate 16K-bpschannel that carries all the necessary control and signaling information fromthe user to the network and back.andM;In ISDN parlance, the two information-carrying channels are referred to asthe Bearer, or B, channels.andP;  The signaling channel is referred to as the Datafor control, or D channel.andP;  The other main ISDN channel is the H channel, thehigh-speed channel.andM;ISDN uses a form of shorthand notation to refer to the various channels.andP;  Thebasic 144K-bps ISDN channel is referred to as 2B+D (two 64K-bps B channelsand one 16K-bps D signaling channel).andP;  Standards for the 2B+D channel wereunanimously accepted at the CCITT plenary session held in Melbourne,Australia, in December 1988.andM;Second, there will be a standard, multipurpose interface connecting ISDNusers to the network.andP;  This standard interface will remove the present needfor a variety of different interfaces, one for each network application.andM;Third, the present array of different networks supporting differentapplications (such as voice, telex and packet-switched networks) will beintegrated into a single common network with enough capacity to handleanything from the transmission of a simple telephone message to full-motionvideo.andM;From these acorns, the telephone companies hope mighty oaks will grow.andP;  Oaktrees, however, take many years to mature.andP;  The recently adopted CCITTstandards for the 2B+D channel concentrate mainly on a standard means ofproviding the 144K-bps transmission path and the common terminal-to-networkinterface.andM;The single common network that will handle all our information requirementsis some years away.andP;  It requires further developments in both opticalswitching and transmission and a new set of standards for the implementationof broadband networks.andM;Many of the technologies necessary for the implementation of broadbandnetworks are evolving rapidly.andP;  Standards for a broadband ISDN giving usersaccess to channels with a transmission speed of more than 100 million bitsper second are currently being formulated and will be presented at the 1992CCITT plenary session in Geneva for ratification.andP;  The first implementationof broadband ISDN networks is likely to occur during the first half of the1990s.andM;The keyword in present and future ISDN networks is flexibility: to attach avariety of terminals to the network; to choose whatever network service isrequired from a single terminal and interface; to send whatever type ofinformation is necessary over a single network and have the network availableon a worldwide basis.andM;Impact of ISDNandM;Every major development in communications has a direct impact on existingeconomic and social structures.andP;  ISDN will be no different.andM;Global ISDN information networks will be a major factor in stimulatinginternational trade, especially in the service sector.andM;ISDN, and the availability of switched digital networks in general, will havea great effect on the further development of computerized links betweenindividual corporations.andP;  Corporations can be ''on-line'' to their suppliers,customers, distributors, retailers, agents, banks and transport companies.andO;The major economic benefits from this include greatly reduced paperwork,just-in-time inventory control, better purchasing opportunities, betterservices to customers and, generally, tighter management and control.andM;Integrated information networks, of which ISDN represents a beginning, willhave a major impact on the way corporations are managed and operate.andP;  Globalinformation networks will allow corporations to manage their overseasoperations much more effectively.andM;Next week, we will look at the growing integration of computing andtelecommunication techniques.andP;  The convergence of these technologies willalter the whole foundation upon which networks are designed.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
