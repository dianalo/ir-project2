Thomas Everett Blasingame, 91, was found lying on his back, hishands folded on his chest, on Wednesday by employees of JA CattleCo. of Goodnight, where Blasingame worked. His saddled horse roamednearby.   ``He must have known he was in trouble, dismounted and just laiddown and died. There were no bruises or scratches so he wasn'tbucked off, but he was riding a young horse he was training,'' saidranch manager Johnny Farrar.   Blasingame said in an interview with the Wichita Falls Timeslast summer that that's the way he ought to die.   He was honored Aug. 19 during the Texas Ranch Roundup. Officialsthere said Blasingame was the oldest working cowboy in the state.   Born on Feb. 2, 1898, in Waxahachie, Texas, Blasingame was acowboy all his life. He was 35 when he married his wife, Eleanor.   ``His life was a better life than what you and I live,'' shesaid last summer. ``He doesn't worry about more than one thing at atime and that's what he's doing right then.''   Among other honors, he earned the Western Heritage WranglerAward presented by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.   Services are set for Saturday at the JA Cattle Co. Cemetery nearClarendon.</TEXT></DOC>
