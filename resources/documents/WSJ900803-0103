The invasion is bound to help Bush's efforts to stave offsome reductions. The Navy is more likely to get funds forfast military cargo ships. Some aircraft and non-nuclearmissile programs also should benefit from the Mideasttension. Bush can use the crisis to argue that lawmakersshould consider &quot;what could happen 10 years from now,&quot; saysformer defense chief Harold Brown.</LP><TEXT>   Backers of the B-2 use Iraqi dangers to renew their pushto save the bomber. But critics argue that such programs weremeant to deter Soviet nuclear threats, not deal with ThirdWorld blow-ups. House Democrats say their proposed cuts spareconventional weapons, such as fighter jets, that are mostuseful in regional crises.   Big cuts are still likely, but the crisis changes themood. Sen. Dole calls it a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for a strongdefense.                                                                                                          ISRAEL REAPS immediate political benefit from the Iraqiinvasion.   &quot;Saddam Hussein replaces the Ayatollah as the devilincarnate in the Mideast, and Israel's strategic importanceis again highlighted,&quot; says New York Rep. Downey. The Iraqidictator's aggression is sure to shore up political supportfor U.S. aid to Israel. The split among Arab nations also isseen as an opportunity for Israel to face up to long-termproblems in the Mideast.   &quot;Israel can't afford to have the Saudis under the gun andneither can the Arab world,&quot; says Wisconsin Rep. Obey,chairman of a House panel overseeing foreign aid. But chancesfor pressuring the Israeli government to accept Baker'sMideast peace plan evaporate as the the Iraqi attackstrengthens Israel's political standing in the U.S.                                                                                                          RECESSION WORRIES, fanned by Iraqi turmoil, hurt GOPcandidates the most.   Oil-price fears fueled by Iraq's invasion will add tovoter concerns about a sluggish economy, falling house pricesand a possible severe downturn by fall elections. The partyin power usually gets the blame. &quot;Combine a recession withtaxes and the Sandamp;L crisis, and you've got a pretty deadlysituation&quot; for the GOP, predicts Democratic politicalconsultant Paul Maslin.   Most at risk: incumbent governors in states with softeconomies, including GOP governors in Rhode Island, Maine,Florida, Nebraska and Iowa. A downturn would hurt GOP Sens.Coats in Indiana and McConnell in Kentucky, and challengerSchneider in Rhode Island. Democratic Sen. Baucus isvulnerable in Montana, where the economy already is bad.   Most economists think an actual recession will be avoided.One bright spot: increased U.S. exports to Europe.                                                                                                          HIGHER OIL PRICES from the Iraqi crisis &quot;could hurt&quot; themovement toward raising taxes on energy as part of a budgetaccord, says House Budget Committee Chairman Panetta. A HouseDemocratic leadership aide says energy taxes are still on thetable for now, but probably would be removed if oil pricesjump sharply.                                                                                                          TAX RESISTANCE is linked to the Sandamp;L scandal. &quot;There's justa sense of rage,&quot; says GOP Rep. Gingrich; voters ask ifCongress will &quot;raise taxes for the savings andamp; loan bailout.&quot;Democratic Rep. Williams says voters oppose taxes to pay for&quot;spending into infinity, and the biggest spending pit tonowhere is the Sandamp;L cleanup.&quot;                                                                                                          MONEY FLOWS into Senate races. Texas Sen. Gramm leads theway with $13.5 million. New Jersey Sen. Bradley is next at$11.5 million. Others above $5 million: Sens. Helms, Simon,Boschwitz, Kerry and Levin. GOP Senate hopefuls Rep. Martinin Illinois and Rep. Tauke in Iowa raise more than $3 millioneach, tops among challengers.                                                                                                          FAMILY LEAVE heats up in the states, after Bush vetoes afederal law. More than 12 states, including Illinois andPennsylvania, have bills pending to create or expandjob-protected leave. Democrats push leave &quot;as one of the maincampaign issues&quot; in the Illinois governor's race, saysShelley Gates of Chicago's Women Employed.                                                                                                          CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION is bogged down by delays anddisputes.   More than two months after the Senate and House passedbills, conferees have met just twice. Much of one session wasspent arguing over whether White House aide Roger Portercould sit in. Environmentalists accuse Rep. Dingell and otherfriends of industry of foot-dragging to increase theirleverage. Dingell denies delaying.   William Fay, head of an industry coalition, says thebiggest threat to the bill &quot;comes from the extremism of theSenate.&quot; He contends senators push to combine the toughestparts of both bills on such issues as industrial emissions oftoxic chemicals. The Sierra Club's Daniel Weiss grumblessarcastically that the process is &quot;moving faster than aspeeding glacier.&quot;   The White House raises its estimate of the annual cost toindustry of each bill to $25 billion by 2005, above the $21billion Bush said he would accept.
