On Sunday, theUnited Nations Security Council unanimously condemned Iraq'sraids against French, Canadian, Dutch and Belgian embassycompounds in Kuwait and several countries made moves to expelIraqi diplomats in retaliation. Talk of an air trafficembargo has intensified. President Bush's appearance on Iraqitelevision Sunday was met with strong anti-U.S. sentimentthat many analysts said left little room for a nonmilitaryresolution of the crisis spawned by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion ofKuwait.   When crude oil futures traders started factoring in theweekend's events yesterday, they annihilated the high of$32.35 for crude contracts in the seven-year history of theNew York Merc. The October crude contract settled $1.87 abarrel higher at $33.63, erasing the previous high set inAugust 1983.   The weekend's bullish headlines were aided considerably byword from President Bush yesterday that he wanted to increasethe size of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve but hadno immediate plans to tap into it to ease a tightness ofcrude supplies.   Also on the supply side, traders attributed part of thesharp gain to news that the Soviet port of Ventspils wouldundergo two to four weeks of long-delayed maintenancestarting Saturday. Some 290,000 barrels of crude oil isexported from there each day. It was unclear whether thatproduction will be totally curtailed or simply cut backduring the repairs.   The New York Merc trading patterns were echoed in Londonwhere the November contract for Brent, a widely tradedbenchmark crude, jumped to $33.00 a barrel. In Europe as wellas in the U.S., trading was light. Analysts say sellers arescarce in this market where so many indicators suggest pricescould go higher. &quot;Any dips in the market bring out a lot ofbuyers,&quot; Mr. Barakat said.   The strength in crude carried over into gasoline andheating oil. Gasoline, which has shown slower gains thancrude recently, added 1.31 cents to the October contract tosettle at 91.67 cents a gallon. The October contract forheating oil, boosted in part by a huge storage tank fire inTexas over the weekend, picked up 2.52 cents a gallon tofinish at 85.31 cents. Outer months of crude, gasoline andheating oil contracts all closed higher, as well.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Futures prices of hogs and cattlejumped amid signs that consumer demand for red meat continuesto be strong this month. In trading at the Chicago MercantileExchange, the price of the live cattle contract for Octoberdelivery set a life-of-contract high of 79.6 cents a poundbefore settling slightly lower at the close. The prices ofcontracts for pork bellies, which are used to make bacon,soared by their maximum daily limit of two cents a pound.According to Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp;Sons, St. Louis, supermarket chains are aggressively stockingtheir red meat sections at a time when the weekly productionof red meat is running between 1% and 2% below the 1989 pace.After the close of trading tomorrow the AgricultureDepartment is slated to release its monthly seven-statesurvey of cattle feedlots. Feedlots fatten cattle forslaughter. Traders expect the department to report that thenumber of young cattle placed on feedlots in August climbed3.2% from a year earlier.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on continued PersianGulf tensions and weakness of the dollar. December deliverygold gained $4.20 an ounce to $395.20, settling just underthe high of the day of $396. December silver advanced 1.6cents an ounce to $4.8530. October platinum was up $2 anounce at $458.90. Gold continued to take its cue from thestrong crude oil market, which was reflecting the Mideastcrisis, but a lack of demand for bullion kept the advancefrom being any stronger, an analyst said.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices rose. The December contract advanced$24 a metric ton to $1,326. There is concern over the size ofthe West African cocoa crops, an analyst said. The IvoryCoast, which is in West Africa, is the world's leading cocoaproducer. Heavy rains have come at a time when temperatureshave cooled, making the trees vulnerable to black poddisease, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson LehmanBrothers. There is strong demand for West African cocoa,especially that from the Ivory Coast, because it is of highquality and it isn't as readily available as lesser-qualitytypes, Ms. Kaul said.</TEXT></DOC>
