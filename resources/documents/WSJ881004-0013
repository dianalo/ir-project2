The suit, filed in state court in Orange County, Calif., alleges that MSI's board and certain officers took actions designed to prevent any takeover &quot;except on terms acceptable to the defendants.&quot; The suit, which seeks class-action status and was filed derivatively on behalf of the company, seeks to enjoin the defendants from continuing their alleged efforts to block Telxon's advances.    MSI last week spurned Telxon's sweetened $20-a-share bid and agreed to be acquired in a friendly transaction by Symbol Technologies Inc., a Bohemia, N.Y.-based maker of bar-code laser scanners, for $23 a share, or an indicated $115.7 million for the 95.5% of MSI's stock that Symbol doesn't already own. Telxon, of Akron, Ohio, is MSI's chief competitor in the hand-held computer business. A spokeswoman for MSI didn't have any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
