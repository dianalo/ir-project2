FRank said the Postal Service now has theprograms in place to ensure the service meets its 1995 goal of processing allmail automatically.andM;Two years ago, when Frank became postmaster general and announced the 1995target, the service's automation program had hit a plateau.andP;  &quot;Today it isgoing full speed, with almost 2,000 optical character readers and bar codesorters in service,&quot; Frank said at the National Postal Forum last month inWashington.andP;  &quot;By 1995, we will have more than 10,000 pieces of this equipmentin place.&quot;andM;Postal officials used the forum to unveil the service's new &quot;40-40-20&quot; schemefor bar coding all mail by 1995.andP;  Bar coding and OCR technologies are thebase for the service's automated mail processing efforts.andM;The Postal Service business strategy calls for customers to apply bar codesto 40 percent of the mail; the service to bar code 40 percent; and remote barcode technology, using video snapshots of problem mail and operators to keyin addresses properly, to bar code the remaining 20 percent.andM;The service also plans to use the new 11-digit ZIP codes, or Advanced BarCodes (ABC), instead of the nine-digit ZIP + 4 codes.andP;  The service shouldmodify all OCRs and bar code sorters for applying and reading the longercodes by 1992, Frank said.andM;The ABC, whose additional two numbers include street address information,should allow the service to sort mail more thoroughly, reducing the time mailcarriers spend preparing mail for delivery and increasing the amount of timethey have to deliver mail.andM;&quot;We anticipate carriers' daily delivery time will increase from 4.25 hours tomore than six hours,&quot; Frank said.andP;  &quot;That's a 41 percent increase in deliverytime, or more than one hour better than ZIP + 4 sector segmentation offers.&quot;andM;The service's ability to obtain its 40 percent of the bar code pie depends onthe machine readability of the mail.andP;  &quot;Thiry percent of addresses have a flawin some minor aspect,&quot; Frank said.andM;To avoid relying on remote bar coding for more than 20 percent of all mail,the service is undertaking a $7 million advertisig campaign next month aimedat improving customer addressing.andP;  The service placed to mail its newComplete Addressing Guide to 90 million homes and more than 8 millionbusiness.andM;In addition to improved addressing, the service plans to have its new widearea bar code machines in operation starting next June.andM;It awarded contracts totaling $27.2 million last month to Bell andamp; Howell Co.andO;and Westinghouse Electric Corp.andM;The two companies will supply the Postal Service with 2,626 new wide area barcode sorters and will modify an additional 2,626 existing sorters.andM;The wide area bar code sorters will be able to read a larger area of anenvelope's surface.andP;  Now, sorters read for bar codes only in the lower rightcorner of envelopes.andM;Half of the new or retrofitted equipment will be in place by June and therest by September, said Michael S. Coughlin, deputy postmaster general.andM;The new sorters should process more than half of the mail volume, however,because the service is installing the equipment in the busier mail processingcenters first, he said.andM;Meanwhile, the service also is working on efforts to automate the processingof bulk and flat mail.andP;  Earlier this summer the Postal Board of Governorsapproved $41.4 million for the service to develop computer-driven machines toprocess larger flat mail, such as big envelopes, magazines and newspapers.andM;By 1994, the flat sorters should be operational and ready for installation atprocessing centers, officials said.andM;Last month, the board approved another $52 million to automate packagesorting.andP;  The service is testing this equipment now and wants to installpackage bar coding systems in 21 bulk mail centers in 1992.andM;&quot;Two years ago, the goal of an automated mail stream seemed to many to bevisionary, laudatory but thoroughly unobtainable objective,&quot; Frank said.andO;&quot;Some people laughed....andP;  Well, here we are two years later.andP;  Nobody'slaughing now.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
