Quoting unidentified sources close to Eastern, NBC reported thatthe airline is considering whether to plead guilty or no contest.   A federal grand jury conducted a 10-month investigation intocharges that Eastern altered the records at New York's Kennedy andLa Guardia airports and at the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta,Eastern's major hub.   Eastern managers at Kennedy and LaGuardia allegedly orderedmechanics to disregard safety guidelines and then falsifiedlogbooks to show that proper checks had been made, the report said.   If criminal charges are filed, it will be the first time anairline has faced such charges over maintenance practices.   In the past, airlines have been fined by the Federal AviationAdministration for bad maintenance.   Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, Martin R. Shugrue, told NBC he haddiscussed the investigation with the prosecutor, U.S. AttorneyAndrew J. Maloney.   ``He sought my cooperation as trustee,'' Shugrue said. ``Ipledged it to him, and the investigation is ongoing.''   The network said Eastern's lawyers plan to meet with theprosecutor Monday to say whether they'll fight the charges.   Maloney would not comment on the case, and there was no answerat Eastern's offices in Miami Friday evening.   Shugrue was appointed trustee to run Eastern as Frank Lorenzo'sreplacement as the airline tries to pull itself out of bankruptcyproceedings.   Machinists at Eastern have been on strike since March 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
