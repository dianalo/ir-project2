The lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court challenges thesurrogacy law's constitutionality and seeks a hearing on a requestto prevent it from taking effect Sept. 1, said Howard Simon,executive director of the ACLU's Michigan chapter.   The law outlaws surrogacy whenever money changes hands and makessurrogacy brokers subject to five years in prison and $5,000 fines.   Three infertile couples, who are the surrogate parents tochildren conceived under contract, and two surrogate mothers haveagreed to be anonymous plaintiffs ``John and Jane Doe,'' Simon said.   ``If we lose there is a chance this will be the end ofsurrogacy,'' Simon said, predicting that bills like that enacted inMichigan would be introduced in other states.   State Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a former Michigan mother of the yearwho led the fight to enact Michigan's law, said her goal was to putNoel Keane of Dearborn, one of the nation's most prolific surrogacymatchmakers, out of business.   By Keane's count he has been responsible for 238 surrogatebirths since 1978. Forty more surrogate babies are on the way, hesaid Wednesday.   Keane is not a party in the suit.   ``I want to distance myself from the lawsuit,'' he said. ``Iwant the issue to be the right of procreation that's on trial ...not Noel Keane's entrepreneurship.''   Keane typically collects $10,000 from a couple he connects witha woman willing to be artificially inseminated, carry a child toterm and then give up custody. Keane handles the contract andarranges the inseminations.   Simon said the lawsuit would challenge the constitutionality ofthe law establishing felony penalties for people who enter intosurrogacy agreements.   ``This is sex discrimination,'' he said, noting theinconsistency of laws that permit an infertile man to arrange apregnancy via a sperm donor but deny the same right to an infertilewoman.   ``We are dealing with the most fundamental rights that peoplehave _ rights involving the decision to have children,'' Simonsaid. ``There is no justification for the state with its huge handto come in and criminalize those decisions.''</TEXT></DOC>
