Just two weeks after its creation, a dissident group called NeuesForum says its numbers have swelled from 30 founders to more than1,500 supporters nationwide.   Neues Forum says it has also received inquiries from a number oflow-level Communist Party members and on Tuesday asked thegovernment to legalize it.   ``For too long, people have only dared to express their hopes inplaces like bars, where it's safe. It's time we start talking aboutthese things out in the open,'' said 27-year-old Klaus, a groupmember who asked that his last name not be used because of possiblepolice reprisals.   Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist government staunchly rejectsthe kinds of reforms under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary andPoland, saying there is no need for them in East Germany.   Neues Forum, which means New Forum, is demanding that EastGermany's rulers heed the call for reforms and that the group belegalized by the government.   ``We want to keep whatever has been proven, but at the same timecreate room for renewal,'' says the group's founding charter.   At one founding member's East Berlin apartment, the telephonerang frequently as people called seeking information about NeuesForum. Several East Berliners knocked on the door with the samerequest.   ``The response has far exceeded our expectations,'' said RolfHenrich, another founding member of Neues Forum who was kicked outof the Communist Party earlier this year for criticizing thegovernment.   Other new pro-democracy groups are springing up as well, with ameeting of activists from across East Germany tentatively plannedfor sometime next month.   It's not clear how many people belong to such groups and how manyhave expressed interest.   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper Tuesday quotedEast Berlin Lutheran Rev. Rainer Eppelmann as saying in an interviewthat there are ``about 500 pro-democracy church groups withmemberships ranging from 10 to 100.''   The Citizens' Movement for Democracy Now was founded last week by12 people, including Lutheran Church pastors, scientists and humanrights activists. The group says it now has a few hundred members.Another pro-reform group, Liste 2, was recently founded in Dresden.   Neues Forum says the exodus of thousands of East Germans to theWest should be a signal to Communist authorities that something mustbe done soon about widespread discontent and despair among EastGerman citizens.   ``People who contact us say they have faced the question whetherto also leave, or stay and try to get something done,'' one of thegroup's founders, East German artist Baerbel Bohley, said on WestGerman ARD television Monday.   Among those making contact with Neues Forum are disillusionedCommunist Party members, the group's leaders say.   It is believed there is a growing desire among lower partyechelons for political and economic reforms but that people at thetop refuse to listen.   ``People contact us saying they have directed a (state-owned)business for 20 years and have ideas for economic changes. They saythat for a long time they have made suggestions to the CentralCommittee, but there was simply no reply,'' Ms. Bohley said.   Ms. Bohley was not interviewed by ARD. Instead, ARD filmed herwhile she was talking on the telephone with a reporter calling froma West German radio station. ARD said it was not permitted by stateauthorities to interview Ms. Bohley in East Berlin.   Neues Forum on Tuesday submitted official applications toCommunist authorities in districts across East Germany seeking to belegalized.   The group's chances for official approval do not look promising.   About 100 activists, including Neues Forum members, were arrestedafter a prayer service at Leipzig's Nikolai church on Monday night.   They included Michael Arnold, Leipzig coordinator for NeuesForum. Arnold and the others were released the next afternoon.   But activists say they will keep up their efforts for changewhether Neues Forum is legalized or not, saying the only alternativefor East Germans is continued frustration and despair.   Henrich, one of the Neues Forum founders, told a gathering ofactivists in East Berlin on Monday night that a congress of allpro-democracy groups is planned for sometime next month to``formulate common goals.''   ``Everyone agrees on one thing. Things cannot go on as they arein the German Democratic Republic (East Germany),'' he said.   Nearly 17,000 people have fled East Germany since Sept. 10, whenHungary defied its hard-line Warsaw Pact ally and orchestrated amass migration to the West by East Germans vacationing in Hungary.</TEXT></DOC>
