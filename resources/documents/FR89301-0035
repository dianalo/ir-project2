The Rulemaking</ITAG>At the present, Method 3 has two procedures_one for molecular weight andthe other for emission rate and excess air calculations. The two proceduresrequire different degrees of accuracy. This situation is awkward when makingreferences in subparts; therefore, the method is being divided.This rulemaking does not impose emission measurement requirements beyondthose specified in the current regulations, nor does it change any emissionstandard. Rather, this rulemaking amends test procedures to which the affectedfacilities are already subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Administrative Requirements </ITAG>A. Public HearingA public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rulemakingin accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishingto make oral presentations should contact EPA at the address given in the<T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble. Oral presentations will belimited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a writtenstatement with EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing.Written statements should be addressed to the Central Docket Section addressgiven in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble.A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be availablefor public inspection and copying during normal working hours at EPA'sCentral Docket Section in Washington, DC (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble).B. Docket.The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submittedto or otherwise considered by EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking.The principal purposes of the docket are to: (1) allow interested partiesto identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process, and (2) serve as the record in case of judicialreview except for interagency review materials (Section 307(d)(7)(A)).C. Office of Management and Budget Review Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a regulatory impact analysis.This rulemaking would not result in any of the adverse economic effectsset forth in Section 1 of the Order as grounds for finding a ``major rule.''It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,nor will it result in a major increase in costs or prices. There will beno significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Thisrulemaking was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act CompliancePursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisattached rule, if promulgated, will not have any economic impact on smallentities because no additional costs will be incurred.This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subjectto OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, Incinerators, Kraft pulp mills.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don R.
