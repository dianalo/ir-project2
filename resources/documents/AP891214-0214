Compensation experts say performance-based incentives arereplacing Christmas bonuses, which _ while technicallydiscretionary _ are frequently perceived by employees and employersalike as gifts.   ``The Christmas bonus is disappearing,'' said compensationconsultant Paul Muller, ``because it no longer is in concert withbusiness needs and practices.''   Bosses who substitute incentive programs for traditional holidaybonuses may risk being labled Scrooges.   But the trend actually reflects the Santa Claus principle ofrewarding good _ meaning productive _ behavior, said Muller,director of Midwest compensation consulting for Ernst andamp; Young, aNew York-based consulting firm.   ``In effect, management now is saying, `To the extent that youhelp us be successful, we'll help you be successful,''' Muller saidWednesday.   He had no statistics to support his contention that year-endbonuses are disappearing but other experts agreed that a trendtoward incentive-based compensation was apparent.   Bob Kurisu of Strategic Compensation Associates in Los Angelessaid Christmas bonuses are ``kind of an anachronism'' and arerarely found in large corporations.   But at companies where year-end bonuses have been traditional,workers often expect them and management may feel obliged to handthem out even if the company has not had a particularly good year,said Frank Belmonte, a compensation consultant with HewittAssociates in Lincolnshire, Ill.   ``When you consider eliminating it, it's not an easy thing todo,'' he said. ``It's a very emotional issue.''   Therefore, he said, employers planning to replace the annualgiveaway with an incentive-based program should give employeesplenty of advance notice and spell out clearly the performancegoals they will have to meet to qualify for incentive pay.   ``Don't eliminate it and say nothing,'' Belmonte said.``Eliminate it and do a lot of communication and explanation.''   Compensation experts said traditional year-end bonuses in theUnited States typically represent 5 percent to 6 percent of annualpay for hourly workers and 10 percent to 15 percent for middlemanagers and executives.   The move away from holiday bonuses coincides with a trend towardfewer employee and retiree benefits, especially in thehealth-insurance area, and lower corporate profits.   But Muller said the elimination of year-end bonuses is motivatednot by cost-cutting but by management's desire to increase workerproductivity.   While U.S. employers are becoming less generous with bonuses,their Japanese counterparts are growing more so. Japanese companiesordinarily pay bonuses twice a year, in summer and before the newyear.   Employees at 291 Japanese companies got winter bonuses thismonth averaging $4,870, up 7.3 percent from last year and thebiggest increase in nine years, the Japanese Federation ofEmployers Association said Wednesday.   An association official in Tokyo attributed the increase tobusiness prosperity in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
