AFTER FLOODING into the labor pool since the early 1970s, mothers appear to be nearing a high-water mark in work-force participation.    The labor-force participation rate of mothers with children under 18 years old edged up to 65% as of last March, compared with 64.7% a year earlier, a Census Bureau survey shows. The 0.3-percentage-point gain in the labor-force rate is less than half the average annual gain of 0.75 percentage point from 1970 to 1987.    Mothers of newborns actually are less likely to be back at work, with 50.8% of women with children under one year old in the labor force, compared with 51.9% a year earlier. The rate for mothers of preschoolers stands unchanged at 56%, while that of mothers with school-age children is up slightly at 73%, compared with 72% a year earlier.    It's hard to say if the slower gains indicate a trend or just a temporary lull. The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that the labor-force rate for all women will steadily grow to 62% by 2000, up from 55.9% in 1988 and 55.4% in 1987. If that projection holds true, the rate for mothers -- which generally follows the trend for all women -- likely will also keep rising.    Who's in Poverty?    Depends on Definition   THERE IS NO question that poverty is a problem in the U.S. It's the size of the problem that's debatable, and that depends on how you measure it. The official poverty definition includes money income only. According to this definition, 13.5% of Americans, or 32.5 million people, were below the poverty threshold in 1987. But if you include the value of non-cash benefits, such as food stamps, subsidized housing, and Medicare, things don't look as bad.    The Census Bureau measures non-cash benefits in two ways. One method measures the market value of a benefit, such as the dollar value of food stamps. The other method measures the recipient's perceived value of the benefit. In other words, if someone is willing to trade in $1,500 worth of food stamps for $1,440 in cash, $1,440 is the recipient value of the benefit.    Adding the market value of food, housing, and medical benefits reduces the general poverty rate to 8.5%, and lifts over 12 million people out of poverty. Based on recipients' perceived value, however, the rate is 11%, removing only six million people.    Westward Ho: Masses   Flock to Los Angeles   THE 10 LARGEST metropolitan areas of the U.S. are home to 71 million Americans, or almost one out of every three people in the country. These areas are concentrated on the East and West coasts, but the shift is increasingly westward.    The New York consolidated area still ranks No. 1. It contains 18 million people, or 7% of Americans, according to Census Bureau estimates. The second largest consolidated area, Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside, lags far behind with 13.5 million. But the New York consolidated area includes Long Island, much of northern New Jersey, and several counties in Connecticut and upstate New York. The New York primary metropolitan area alone -- which only includes the city's five boroughs and Putnam, Rockland and Westchester counties -- has 8.5 million people, less than half of the New York consolidated area population.    Comparing primary areas, the Los Angeles-Long Beach area has only 24,000 people less than New York, the Census Bureau's July 1987 estimate shows. Considering that Los Angeles is growing faster than New York, the government's 1988 estimates should put it over the top as the most populated primary metropolitan area. Some private surveys already rank Los Angeles No. 1.    Hispanic Groups Show   Wide Diversity   THERE ARE more than 19 million Hispanics in the U.S. today, 12.1 million of whom are of Mexican origin.    Because Mexican-Americans are the majority, they tend to overshadow other Hispanic groups. But the differences among these groups are striking, Census Bureau data show.    Compare Cubans and Mexicans, for example. Most Cubans in the U.S. came some time ago and have demographic characteristics similar to non-Hispanics. Mexican-Americans generally immigrated more recently, which means they tend to be younger and not as well off.    Hispanics of Cuban origin have a median age of 38.7 years, compared with 23.9 years for Mexican-Americans. Cubans are also better educated and hold more skilled jobs. Seventeen percent of Cubans in the U.S. have had four or more years of college, compared with only 7% of Mexican-Americans. Twenty-four percent of the Cuban work force hold managerial and professional jobs, while only 10% of Mexican workers have these kinds of jobs. As a result, Cubans are less likely to be in poverty; 14% of Cuban families have incomes below the poverty line, compared with 26% of Mexican families. </TEXT></DOC>
