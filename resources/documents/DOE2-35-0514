<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0514 </DOCNO><TEXT>The state of the art in general purpose simulation systems incorporatescombined continuous and discrete simulation, represented by commercialproducts and prototype processor packages such as the GGC (GPSS-GaspCombined) and 1-GGC (Lisp-GGC). The growing importance of symbolic (AI)elements in simulation and of symbolic simulation itself is seen in useof production systems in simulation environments and models. Exploitingthe full range of symbolic processing may be moving the art to a higherplane which includes symbolic methods. The 1-GGC couches general purposesimulation capability in a powerful symbolic computing language, Lisp,and contrasts with the FORTRAN-based GGC which joins with facilitiesof an augmented version of Stage 2, a symbol processor. This augmentedsystem offers extended user interaction, operating system communication,file access, table and graph processing and forms a basis for a multilevelportability mechanism: base (abstract machine) language, implementationlanguage, language-mimicking capabilities of system-provided definitions.Some of this is demonstrated in neural computing examples. A 30-processorSequent 21,000 computer promises new departures for this line of research.19 references.</TEXT></DOC>
