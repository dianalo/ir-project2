James Audu, spokesman for the cartel, read a joint communiquefollowing a short meeting between six OPEC and seven non-OPECcountries that was designed to consider collaborative action toshore up prices.   The statement said the six OPEC members would present to therest of the cartel on Thursday a proposal by the independentproducers to cut the countries' oil exports by 5 percent for twomonths. The statement said the meeting represented a ``new stage ofcooperation.''   There was no immediate indication that the PEC group eitherendorsed or rejected the proposal, which OPEC President RilwanuLukman of Nigeria earlier had called a ``good beginning'' forcooperation between oil producers.   Iran, which was not involved in today's talks, declared itssupport for the export-cutting plan, but most other countries gavelittle indication of their views.   Analysts said the proposal, if implemented, would push oilprices higher.   The proposal was put to an OPEC ministerial committee Tuesdaynight by a group of seven independent oil-producing nations,including Mexico and China.   The plan calls for members of both groups to reduce oil exportsby 5 percent for two months, beginning May 1. It would meanreducing exports by a total of about 800,000 barrels a day.   The idea is to take enough oil off the world market to forceprices up to at least OPEC's target level of $18 a barrel.   OPEC oil currently is selling for between $14 and $16 a barreland last month was slightly lower than that.   The six OPEC ministers meeting today were to hold anothersession later in the day with the seven outside producers. All 13OPEC members then were to convene Thursday to consider theexport-cut plan.   Paul Mlotok, an analyst for the investment firm Salomon BrothersInc. and an observer of the Vienna meetings, said the plan, ifimplemented, would have ``a very positive'' effect on the oilmarket, which has been weakened by excess supplies.   Most the OPEC members represented in today's talks withheldimmediate comment on the proposal, which the cartel had solicited.   The seven non-OPEC countries involved in the talks are Mexico,China, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia and Colombia.   Delegation sources said later that OPEC and the independentproducers already were squabbling over terms of the proposal.   Colombia, participating in the talks on the non-OPEC side,indicated it would not join in the export reductions, said thesources, speaking on condition of anonymity.   OPEC officials also had asserted privately that some of theindependent producers had inflated the figures for their currentexports in order to minimize the impact on their actual sales,these sources said.   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, declined to saywhether his country supported the proposed cut in exports. He toldreporters, however, that ``we'd like greater participation'' byindependent producers in export reductions. He did not mention anycountries by name.   Kazempour Ardebili, the deputy Iranian oil minister, said in aninterview that his government favored the plan.   ``We accept the extent of the cut'' in exports, he said, addingthat Iran hoped additional non-OPEC countries, including Norway andthe Soviet Union, could be brought into the plan.   Ardebili also criticized Saudi Arabia's decision to breakdiplomatic relations with Tehran.   He said the move was not likely to interfere with the OPECdeliberations in Vienna, ``although it may have been intended tohave that effect.''   He also asserted that the United States was behind the Saudidecision, announced Tuesday.   ``This is a justification for more (U.S.) military presence inthe (Persian) Gulf in the future,'' Ardebili said.   Members of the Saudi delegation to the OPEC talks were notimmediately available for comment.   The proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the OPECcommittee by Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart. He saidafterward that for the non-OPEC group a 5 percent reduction wouldamount to cutting exports by 200,000 barrels a day.   He declined to say what Mexico or the other independentproducers would do if OPEC did not agree to the export-reductionoffer.   OPEC is sharply divided about whether it should reduce its oilproduction, although it long has welcomed the prospect ofcollaborative efforts by independent oil-producers.   Any joint action would mark the first such accord with outsideoil producers in OPEC's 28-year history.   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission _ whichregulates that state's oil industry _ said Tuesday that he saw a50-50 chance the Vienna meeting would produce an agreement to cutoil output.   Hance was not involved in the group meetings but was holdingprivate talks with individual OPEC and non-OPEC officials tounderscore what he called his state's desire to see stable oilprices.</TEXT></DOC>
