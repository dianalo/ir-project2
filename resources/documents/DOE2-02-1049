The developmental activities covered are energy productionand combustion, industrial processes, and agricultural practices. Someattention is directed as well to emissions resulting from natural processes,as distinct from those governed by human activity. The impacts studiedon a regional basis are photochemical smog, precipitation acidity, andatmospheric corrosion. The global issue addressed is stratospheric ozonemodification. The regions included are northeastern US, Europe, and theGangetic Plain of India. In addition, some consideration is given tothe Amazonian Basin of Brazil. While the major part of the effort isdirected to historical trends, illustrative 50- and 100-year projectionsare also presented. These point up the prospects of severe degradationin atmospheric quality resulting from emissions from a number of thedevelopmental activities studied. These findings are presented more inqualitative than quantitative terms. Improvements in scientific understanding,data, and policy approaches are essential elements in conducting morerefined research on these questions. 137 refs., 26 figs., 18 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
