The two fields, known as Cohasset and Panuke, are about 30miles west of Nova Scotia's Sable Island.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a very important first step for offshore NovaScotia and probably for offshore Canada,&quot; said Carey Ryan,assistant deputy minister of the Nova Scotia Ministry ofMines and Resources. &quot;We're quite optimistic that it is goingto go ahead as planned.&quot;   Public hearings are to start next month on the proposedproject, a joint venture of London andamp; Scottish, which iscalled Lasmo, and Nova Scotia Resources Ltd., a provincialgovernment agency. Lasmo is a major independent oil and gasproducer.   A final decision on whether to approve the Lasmo proposalis expected to be made jointly by the federal and Nova Scotiaenergy ministers by August.   The fields are expected to produce about 35 millionbarrels of oil over six years starting in 1992. They containa high-value condensate that can be used to make jet fuel andcan be blended with heavier crudes.   Development of the two fields is expected to cost 156million Canadian dollars (US$132.5 million), less than 5% ofthe estimated development costs for the big Hibernia oilfield off Newfoundland. Hibernia isn't expected to be broughtinto production until 1996.   Lasmo, which has developed similar small fields in theNorth Sea and elsewhere, will use a leased jack-up rig todrill production wells in each field. The rig also will serveas a production platform. The condensate will be piped to therig, pumped into a moored storage tanker and brought ashoreby a shuttle tanker.   Lasmo said several companies in Canada, the U.S. andEurope already have expressed interest in buying thecondensate.   The proposed Lasmo development so far has encounteredlittle opposition. The fields aren't in prime fishinggrounds, and Lasmo said it won't operate its rig during therough winter months, to reduce the risk of an oil spill.   The company has met with fishermen to assure them of theproject's low risks. Condensate isn't &quot;that tarry, stickysubstance that will cling to shorelines,&quot; a Lasmo spokeswomansaid. In the event of a spill, condensate, unlike heavycrude, would evaporate quickly, she said. Nova Scotiafishermen have blocked exploratory drilling in Georges Bank,a fishing ground off the province.   Exploration has been conducted off the East Coast for 25years, but no oil from the region has ever been brought tomarket. The Lasmo development will be a &quot;kick start&quot; forother offshore exploration and development ventures,predicted Laurie Taylor, manager of the Canadian PetroleumAssociation's Eastern region.   Cohasset was discovered in 1973 by Mobil Oil Canada Ltd.,a unit of Mobil Corp. Shell Canada Ltd., a subsidiary ofRoyal Dutch/Shell Group, drilled the first well in the Panukefield in 1986.   The C$5.1 billion Hibernia project, which is severalhundred miles northeast of Cohasset and Panuke, has beenstalled because of low oil prices and protracted negotiationswith the federal and Newfoundland governments on governmentfinancial support and guarantees. The governments and aconsortium of companies led by Mobil Oil Canada are expectedto sign by the end of June an agreement that would allowconstruction of the project to begin. Hibernia is expected toproduce 110,000 barrels a day of crude oil.   Terra Nova, another big oil field off Newfoundland, alsois expected to begin production in the mid-1990s.Petro-Canada, a government agency and leader of theconsortium developing the field, recently revised its reserveestimate for Terra Nova to 300 million barrels from 132million. The project is expected to cost C$2 billion.   Aside from some seismic work under way in Cohasset andPanuke, one well is being drilled off the East Coast. Thewell, near the Terra Nova field, is the first to be drilledin the region in almost a year.</TEXT></DOC>
