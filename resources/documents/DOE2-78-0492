The thermal conductivity of soil was measured by the steady-statemethod, and the heat transfer characteristics in soil were examined inthis study. In measuring the thermal conductivity through experiments,firstly the thermal conductivity of a reference plate was measured bythe steady-state method, then on the basis of the above mentioned result,the thermal conuctivity of soil was obtained by the comparative method.Toyoura standard sands with particle size of 0.21-0.25mm were used asthe sample. As the experiment result, the relations between the thermalconductivity of the reference plate (glass) and temperature was madeclear, furthermore through the measurements using these relations, itwas clarified that the apparent thermal conductivity is influenced bysoil water content. It seems that the difference between the apparentthermal conductivity and the real one is caused mainly by a migrationof latent heat with a migration of steam. (10 figs, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
