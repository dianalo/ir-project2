 Windows 3.0 now looks like the hot ticket to the future.andM;According to one Microsoft source, the company's employees switch betweenWindows and OS/2 on their own machines.andP;  Windows has been the system ofchoice since its inception.andP;  More recently, as OS/2 has progressed, manybegan to switch to it.andP;  Just as critical mass was approaching, suddenly alongcomes Windows 3.0.andP;  Now I'm told Microsoft employees have gone back toWindows en masse.andP;  Of course, it's still up in the air whether or not thepublic buys into Windows.andM;What Windows Needs to Be a Success Dept.: Here are my recommendations: (1)Better appearance.andP;  Supposedly, Microsoft is consulting with San Francisco'sSusan Kare, the talented superstar artist who is credited with designing theentire Mac screen &quot;look&quot; and much of the look of the NeXT interface.andP;  Thisstep will help only if they take her advice.andP;  (2) Ability to runplain-vanilla DOS applications without noticeable degradation.andP;  As it nowstands, Windows slows the performance of regular DOS applications to such anextent that few users are willing to put up with it.andP;  One theory has it thatMicrosoft will just wait for the 586 and let hardware correct the performancegap.andP;  (3) High-performance multitasking including telecommunications as abackground task.andP;  (4) Improved ease of use.andP;  The MS-DOS Executive interfaceis not as intuitive as it should be.andM;Genuinely Interesting Newsletter Dept.: If you are in the hardware businessas a manufacturer or even an interested hobbyist, you must obtain asubscription to Microprocessor Report.andP;  This is the &quot;in&quot; newsletter forhardware hacks.andP;  In 1990 it will become a twice-monthly $395 hit.andP;  It's oneof the few $395 hits that's worth every penny.andP;  Microprocessor Report, 550California Ave., #320, Palo Alto, CA 94306; (415) 494-2677.andM;Microprocessor Report is where you can get the inside scoop on the Intel 486and the Motorola 68040, as well as the interesting rumor that the designersof the i860 are going to quit Intel to go out and do board-level design usingthe new chip.andP;  That might put a crimp in the design of the i960, but it willget the i860 more exposure.andP;  The i860, which was raved about in mid-1989, ishardly discussed anymore.andM;The Microprocessor Report also holds an annual forum (who doesn't?).andP;  Itdiffers from all the other me-too forums, however, in that the speakers donot include Bill Gates, Philippe Kahn, Rod Canion, and John Sculley allgiving their same old canned speeches.andP;  The crowd appears to be a slew ofnitpicking superstar techies from all the chip companies who love to argueabout everything.andP;  An engineer's version of a pro wrestling Battle Royale.andO;The last guy left in the ring wins.andM;While on the Subject Dept.: This brings up the sore subject of secondsourcing.andP;  It's always been traditional for a chip designer to license itsdesigns to other chip makers so that customers can be assured of a constantsupply of chips.andP;  This is a courtesy.andP;  Say, for example, that Intel had beendecimated by the last earthquake.andP;  Would the whole PC world come to astandstill if the company were destroyed and its entire inventory of 386chips melted?andM;Of course, Intel sees it differently.andP;  They've invented a cash cow, and theyfigure on being its only milkers.andP;  What bothers me about all this is thenewest gambit by Intel to sink the 286 business.andP;  Maybe I'm too moralistic,but it seems that Intel invented the 286 and licensed it to other vendors tohelp establish a market for the chip.andP;  When the 286 was released, the companyextolled its virtues, didn't it?andP;  Now, because other fabricators (namelyHarris and AMD) make the chip better and more efficiently than Intel, Intelwill do a negative publicity campaign to turn people away from the chip.andM;Hey, the 286 isn't my chip of choice.andP;  But it's a lot better than the 8088 orthe 8086, neither of which do I see Intel condemning.andP;  What galls me in allthis anti-286 publicity is that Intel invented the chip in the first placeand Intel told us how great it was way back when.andP;  Now it's telling us thatit's a dog.andP;  What kind of game is this, anyway?andP;  Will the 386 be a dog too?andO;The 486?andP;  It seems to me that the 286 was invented for a purpose by peoplewho worked for the company to create something better than the 8086.andP;  Istheir work for naught?andP;  I can't imagine being a design engineer for the 286.andO;I'd be praised one minute, then made the fool the next minute.andP;  This is not agood sign.andM;While Intel still, in my mind, makes the best microprocessors, the ideabehind microprocessors is no longer a dark secret.andP;  Motorola, NEC, Fujitsu,MIPS, Sun, and plenty of others are designing microprocessors.andP;  Once upon atime, a newcomer by the name of Zilog came along, and way back then the 8080was the king of microprocessors.andP;  In no time flat, Zilog with its Z-80 tookthe sandwich right out of Intel's mouth and began to chew.andP;  Luckily forIntel, Zilog was owned by an oil company, Exxon.andP;  These guys didn't know whatthey were doing in data processing and self-destructed.andM;Observers saw what happened, though.andP;  Intel was vulnerable then, and it'svulnerable today.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
