What is striking in a two-hour discussion with Mr. Brown, Mr. Williams and 10 of their neighbors is how little common ground the two camps have. That could spell trouble for the GOP as it struggles with the questions of how far it should go to accommodate Robertson supporters and whether they can be motivated in November to vote for a candidate other than Mr. Robertson himself.    Initially, some Republican strategists believed that Mr. Robertson's candidacy would enhance the party's chances in 1988 by broadening its base of support. But if voters here are any guide, the Robertson legacy may be a divisive one that imperils GOP unity for November.    Bush and Dole voters are resentful of Mr. Robertson and fearful of the forces the Virginian is seeking to unleash on their party. They use words like &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;frightening&quot; to describe his influence. The Robertson people, by contrast, view themselves as being more on a crusade than a campaign; their enemy isn't George Bush or Bob Dole, but what they see as the moral decline of America.    &quot;There are, in effect, two electorates,&quot; says Peter Hart, a political analyst who organized and conducted the discussion group on behalf of The Wall Street Journal earlier this week. &quot;With Ronald Reagan not there to paper it over, there is clearly the potential that these two groups may split apart down the road and go in very separate paths.&quot;    While these dozen voters don't represent a scientific sampling of public opinion, they amplify the results of a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The poll shows that nearly two-thirds of likely Republican voters view Mr. Robertson unfavorably and that there has been a significant increase in the number of Republicans -- now nearly one in three -- who couldn't support Mr. Robertson if he became the GOP nominee. By roughly 2-to-1 margins, Republicans believe he has made more unfounded statements than the other GOP candidates, and believe that his supporters aren't as interested in the future of the party as are those of other candidates.    Mr. Robertson is clearly a man who arouses strong opinions. Here in the Columbia discussion group, his supporters are rock-solid behind him. He is &quot;someone who's willing to stand up, take a stand, even when the cards are against&quot; him, says Ann Casiano, a 42-year-old teacher. In contrast, support for Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole is far softer, with voters currently supporting each man saying they could still switch from the one to the other.    What unites these more traditional GOP voters is their distaste for Mr. Robertson. His campaign &quot;is hurting the Republicans,&quot; says Van Edwards III, a 41-year-old attorney in the discussion group who is mulling his choice between Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole. &quot;It's going to pull the whole Republican Party to the right of center of this country, and it's going to make it harder to have someone elected.&quot;    Phyllis Gunter, a 58-year-old real-estate broker who supports Mr. Bush, adds: &quot;I'm scared to death of someone who thinks they have the one way.&quot;    The Robertson voters in the group, so far at least, don't reciprocate those hard feelings. With Mr. Robertson, they feel, they have a historic opportunity to save the nation. &quot;What Pat's got on his side is, he's got the Lord,&quot; says Debra Stone, a 30-year-old Baptist minister's daughter who works as a beautician. Mr. Robertson's voters are headed into this process with high hopes that their message and their man are going to be heeded. Ms. Stone, a Democrat who plans to cross over and vote in this state's GOP primary, says, &quot;I believe he can do what he says.&quot;    But pollster Hart warns, &quot;The potential trap for the Republicans with these voters is that at the end of the process they'll feel abandoned and ignored.&quot;    That is just what worries some of the traditional Republicans in the discussion group. &quot;I think Robertson's done to the Republicans exactly what {the Rev. Jesse} Jackson's done to the Democrats,&quot; says Mr. Edwards, the attorney. &quot;He's siphoned off a huge area that supported the party and is taking it out of the race. Nobody knows what effect this is going to have.&quot;    The nationwide Journal/NBC News poll, conducted Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, points up the suspicion with which much of the Republican Party views Mr. Robertson. His &quot;unfavorable&quot; rating is sharply higher than such ratings of Mr. Jackson among Democrats. Despite his emphasis on moral values, only 13% of likely Republican voters think he has the best moral character. Mr. Bush was favored by 29% of those voters on this question, and Mr. Dole by 21%.    Less than one in 10 likely GOP voters believes Mr. Robertson cares the most about people like themselves, compared with one in three for Mr. Bush and one in four for Mr. Dole.    Here in the discussion group, the front-runners' supporters express some concerns about their own candidates as well. The word &quot;abrasive&quot; is used to describe Mr. Dole even by some of his own supporters. Mr. Bush's backers sometimes sound a little defensive about their choice. &quot;I will be voting for Bush because he seems the lesser of other evils,&quot; Anna Ballard, a 53-year-old programmer, says with a sigh.    Pollster Hart, a Democrat who isn't working for any presidential candidate this year, observes: &quot;The irony is that Bush and Dole are fighting like mad with each other when the one thing that could get them more votes is standing up against Pat Robertson.&quot;    Mr. Robertson's recent controversial pronouncements -- about U.S. hostages in Lebanon, Soviet missiles in Cuba, the allegation that Mr. Bush might have leaked the Jimmy Swaggart scandal -- have solidified the mistrust of the more traditional Republican voters. &quot;I thought it was odd that he brought up the timing there, because I hadn't even associated him with Jimmy Swaggart,&quot; says Barbara Amason, 38, a teacher's aide.    Some GOP strategists have speculated that Mr. Robertson's statements were designed to stir up his supporters. If so, there isn't any evidence in the discussion group that the strategy succeeded; Mr. Robertson's backers seem a little embarrassed by the statements, though their faith in him remains unshaken.    &quot;He's got his foot in his mouth now, but at least we know where the man stands,&quot; says Gerald Nagy, a 33-year-old computer consultant and born-again Christian. He still plans to vote for Mr. Robertson because &quot;I'd rather have somebody in the White House that I felt had some guts to follow through on his beliefs.&quot;    Mrs. Casiano, the schoolteacher, is similarly unshaken in her vote for Mr. Robertson, although she is concerned that the Swaggart scandal will hurt his ability to reach beyond his Christian base. Mr. Williams, the sheriff's deputy, agrees: &quot;It just tends to lead some people to have distrust in all television evangelists,&quot; he says. &quot;Just like in my profession. You get one bad policeman, you got all bad policemen. It's hard to live that image down.&quot;    There doesn't appear to be any burning issue that stirs these voters. Even Mr. Dole's backing for stiffer import restrictions on textiles -- a major industry here in South Carolina -- hasn't made much impact on them. For these voters, at least, the issue is Pat Robertson.    &quot;I think the reason he's so frightening is that he does strike a real nerve that is in America . . . that thinks this is the one true way,&quot; says Mr. Edwards, the lawyer. &quot;I'm very afraid of that kind of thinking.&quot;    Ms. Stone, the beautician and Robertson backer, is puzzled by such talk. &quot;Whenever they say that he's dangerous and they're scared of him,&quot; she says, &quot;I think it's the fear of God.&quot;    ---   'IN GENERAL, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of him?'
