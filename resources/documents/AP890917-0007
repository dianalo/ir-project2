Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' and said itcould be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region sinceHurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 peoplein the Caribbean and Florida.   ``The eye of the hurricane is directly above Guadeloupe,'' IsraelMatos, director of the National Weather Service bureau in San Juan,said Sunday at 1:25 a.m. EDT. It was impossible to telephone toGuadeloupe early Sunday morning as telephone circuits were eitherjammed or busy.   At midnight EDT Saturday, Hugo's center was near 16.3 northlatitude and 61.1 west longitude, about 350 miles east-southeast ofSan Juan. After hitting the French island it was expected to movenorth toward Puerto Rico, said forecaster Martin Nelson at theNational Hurricane Center near Miami.   The hurricane was moving west-northwest at 12 mph, sendingshowers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean andthreatening islands over a 600-mile arc stretching from St. Lucia toPuerto Rico.   The storm's effects would start to be felt in the Virgin Islandsand Puerto Rico by Sunday morning, the National Weather Service inSan Juan said.   By midnight there was a blackout in most of Guadeloupe asauthorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure,government radio RFO said. The island experienced very strong winds,which blew the metal roofing off some homes on Guadeloupe's easternside late Saturday night.   In Dominica to the south there were power outages on the island'snorth side where strong winds uprooted trees, the radio said.   Radio France Internationale from Paris, monitored in San Juanshortly before midnight Saturday, said French authorities werepreparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to Guadeloupe.   ``It's a very dangerous storm, extremely dangerous in fact,''Nelson said.   Forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly courseit would pass over St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands about 6 p.m.Sunday and continue on to the northeastern coast of Puerto Ricoearly Monday. San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital with a populationof 1.1 million, is on the northeastern coast.   Earlier, forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for PuertoRico's southern coast.   The National Weather Service in Miami issued hurricane warningsat 3 p.m. EDT for the U.S. Virgin Islands and for Puerto Rico, whichpreviously had been on a hurricane watch. The warnings were postedfrom Martinique northward and westward through Puerto Rico,including the British Virgin Islands and St. Martin and surroundingislands.   Tropical storm watches for the islands of Barbados and St.Vincent were discontinued, and a warning for St. Lucia was changedto a tropical storm watch.   Forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expectednear the eye of Hugo, and warned of heavy rain and flooding.   In Guadeloupe and Dominica, the first two islands directly inHugo's path, civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people torescue shelters.   Franklin McDonald, head of the Pan-Caribbean DisasterPreparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said several reliefteams from the United States already were headed to the region.   State radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide earlySaturday on Dominica's isolated southeast side, which faces theAtlantic, partly blocking a road but causing no injuries. The PublicWorks Department deployed earth-moving equipment at strategic pointsacross the island.   Non-critically ill patients at Princess Margaret Hospital in thecapital of Roseau were sent home late Friday and early Saturday tomake room for possible hurricane victims.   The government of Dominica urged its citizens via radio to takeemergency precautions, and said police were put on alert ``to dealwith any security problem which might arise.'' There was widespreadlooting after Hurricane David battered the tiny island of 81,000people.   In Guadeloupe, which has a population of 340,000, heavy trafficbuilt up in Pointe-a-Pitre, the biggest city, late Friday as peoplerushed supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up on food,bottled water and supplies such as flashlights, batteries, timber,nails and tape.   The government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off thestreets by 6 p.m. in what amounted to a curfew. The directions werebroadcast on radio stations.   Residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many onthe Atlantic side fled inland.   At Le Meridien, a luxury, 271-room beachfront hotel in St.Francois, a woman who answered the telephone said guests were beingmoved from ground-floor rooms and those facing the ocean. But shesaid none of the 100 guests had checked out.   ``Many people are worried; nobody's hysterical,'' said the hotelemployee, who asked not to be identified by name.   In Paris, Air France canceled all three of its flights scheduledSaturday to Guadeloupe's sister island, Martinique, and BritishAirways canceled its flight from London to Antigua, where theairport was closed.   Officials in Puerto Rico said up to 6,000 people might have to beevacuated from flood-prone areas if Hugo passes near the denselypopulated island of 3.3 million.   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricaneseason, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
