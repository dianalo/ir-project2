EPA originallyestimated CTDM, which addresses airborne pollutants, to cost $5.7 millionbut so far it has expended $8.5 million through FY 1987. Additional improvementsand refinements to the models will be necessary before EPA can use themto make regulatory decisions to reduce pollution.</TEXT></DOC>
