Still, even under these conditions, it's hard to ignorethe unmistakable beating of voodoo drums throughout Haiti'scountryside, particularly this past Monday, the first day ofthe voodoo calendar.   Voodoo rhythms are also to be heard blaring out fromHaiti's unique, multicolored trucks and buses. These vehiclesare usually overflowing with passengers. But now they arefilled with plastic gallon bottles of gasoline, smuggledacross the border to get around an international tradeembargo imposed on Haiti. The embargo was imposed in order toinduce the return of deposed President Jean BertrandAristide, toppled in a Sept. 30 coup. Even the voodoocelebrations have been affected by the embargo. After all,what's a voodoo ceremony without a ritual goat sacrifice? andgoats have become a scarce commodity during the embargo.</LP><TEXT>   But perhaps the limited voodoo venerations worked afterall: A preliminary settlement that may lead to Mr. Aristide'sreturn was announced on Wednesday. Negotiating partiestentatively agreed on the choice of Communist leader ReneTheodore as the new prime minister in Haiti's quasi-French,mixed system of political &quot;cohabitation.&quot; Still, resentmentsrun deep. Interim Prime Minister Jean Jacques Honorat(awarded the American Bar Association's human-rights awardlast year) spoke bitterly of Mr. Aristide's return: &quot;{Thecoup} helped save 20,000 lives from the rampaging mobs thatserved Aristide. They could have pushed this country intoreal civil war. That's the point about the coup.&quot;   And even if Mr. Theodore and a coalition cabinet areconfirmed by Parliament, there are many complex issues tonegotiate before the charismatic &quot;Pere Titid&quot; sets foot onHaitian soil, and wild celebrations begin. These include howto divide power between his presidency and a Theodoregovernment; the establishment of civilian supremacy over themilitary, or at least a reduction of the latter's autonomy;removal of the constitutionally outlawed, paramilitary&quot;TonTon Macoutes&quot; and the army section chiefs from theirgovernment positions; and establishment of the futuremonitoring and technical assistance roles of the Organizationof American States (OAS) and the United Nations, which havesupported the embargo. It is not clear that the embargo willinduce the army, Mr. Aristide and the parliamentarians toagree on all these points.   The only real alternative to the current embargo of Haitiwould have been a military invasion. &quot;Invasion&quot; may be tooharsh a word, since it probably would have taken just oneU.S. F-16 &quot;persuasion flight&quot; to neutralize the Haitian army,with its two functioning tanks. Nevertheless, there wasconcern that the U.S. might be forced into another lengthyoccupation, similar to the one from 1915 to 1934, when theU.S. created the Haitian army.   Left on its own, however, the Haitian army has been evenmore brutal than is considered normal here. It is no longerreluctant -- as it was in a coup two years ago -- to shootcivilians. In the recent coup, it adopted the TiananmenSquare/Burmese army's responses to people power: Open fire ondissident crowds. One businessman who is no friend of Mr.Aristide notes: &quot;I definitely feared Aristide's `class-wartalk,' but my fear of the army is much more terrifying.&quot; Theinitial killing of from 200 to 2,000 mostly Aristidesupporters was so swift and decisive in the first days afterthe coup that there has been no need for many moreexecutions. There have been no marches or radio newsbroadcasts lately.   The embargo, therefore, has not prevented Haiti frommaintaining the worst human-rights record in the hemisphere,if not in its own history. While the final effects are stillunknown, the Haitian economy has been devastated, with somesectors like banking and manufacturing in virtual bankruptcy.   The U.S. Embassy estimates that more than 240,000 jobsassociated with the offshore manufacturing sector were lostas of December. Haiti's dynamic but harsh capitalist sectorno longer will include many of these departing or closedcompanies. It is hoped that others will perceive that newembargoes will not necessarily disrupt future sales. It isnot surprising that the exporters' association was the onlybusiness group that opposed the coup and called for Mr.Aristide's reinstatement.   According to OAS estimates, some 300,000 Haitians havefled the capital to the countryside, where eating does notdepend upon cash incomes. However, some reportedly havereturned to the city because the situation was just as bad.   &quot;In the poorest country in the hemisphere,&quot; said oneAristide voter, &quot;the embargo is turning Haiti into anEthiopia. Many of those in areas without gasoline arestarving. The rest who formerly used gas or electricity tocook are burning charcoal, accelerating deforestation,erosion and water depletion.&quot; Many reportedly have diedbecause they cannot get to hospitals or no oxygen wasavailable when they got there.   If the poor have been most harmed by the embargo, parts ofthe military mafia have profited from the scarcities created.Having the Haitian and Dominican militaries enforce theembargo along their frontiers is akin to having the fox guardthe chicken coop. Every night when the two official bordercrossings are closed to the public, as well as at theunofficial entry roads, residents interviewed say that truckscarrying contraband are heard driving across. A Dominicanarmy officer was unapologetic, noting, &quot;If we were to stopthe illegal trade, Haiti would have a social explosion. Thenwe would be flooded with Haitians, whom we cannot absorb.&quot;   But the embargo violations go far beyond small stashesignored by border guards. On New Year's Day, for example, atanker full of diesel fuel was delivered from Colombia -- acountry supposedly firmly committed to the embargo. Whilethis was a clear violation of the embargo, a similar deliveryof diesel in late November was apparently from anonparticipating country.   Not everyone violating the embargo is profiteering. Onebusinessman noted, &quot;Why should we give up everything that wehave built in the past decades, just because of 200 soldiers?Besides, our customers are suffering if we do not help them.&quot;   The embargo may sway the army to let Mr. Aristide returnbecause it is succeeding in one respect: Haiti's economy ison the ropes. Eventually, the &quot;golden egg&quot; of contraband willrun out if there is no one left to buy contraband. But evenif a final agreement is reached and somehow respected, theembargo will have been a Pyrrhic victory. For Haiti faces theequivalent of Latin America's &quot;lost decade&quot; of development.What the debt crisis did to Latin America in the 1980s, theembargo of Haiti has accomplished in just a few months.   ---   Mr. Carey is a free-lance writer.</TEXT></DOC>
