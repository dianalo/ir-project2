(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former PTL aides were convictedTuesday of evading $525,000 in income taxes on money they took fromthe television ministry to buy condominiums, furs, jewelry andnearly $100,000 worth of shoes.   A federal jury deliberated five hours before convicting thebrothers, James and David Taggart, on identical charges: conspiracyto defraud the government and impede the IRS by willfully evadingincome taxes, and filing false tax returns for the years 1984,1985, 1986 and 1987.   ``Greed doesn't pay, no matter how rich you are, you've got topay your taxes,'' said federal prosecutor David Brown after theverdict. ``The statement was not about PTL; it was about DavidTaggart and James Taggart's obligations to pay their taxes nomatter how much they own and what kind of lifestyle they live.''   Brown said he wasn't surprised the jury took just five hours.   ``They didn't need to spend a lot of time looking at thedocuments,'' he said. ``A person can omit $200 (in income) on theirtax return but it's hard to miss $1 million.''   ``They were innocent going in and they are innocent comingout,'' said defense lawyer Ben Cotten. He said he was to blame forthe guilty verdict, citing ``my ineptitude and two very capable andcompetent government counsel backed with unlimited resources.''   Brown said the case was decided by the defendants' owntestimony, but Cotten said they were forced to testify.   ``They had to take the stand,'' Cotten said. ``They had to telltheir story. If they hadn't, the jury wouldn't have been able tobelieve anything but a series of paper trails.''   Cotten said the Taggarts' reaction to the verdict was ``a calm,`where do we go from here?''' The brothers refused comment as theyleft the courthouse.   The Taggarts were charged with evasion after they allegedlyspent nearly $1.2 million in PTL money on personal luxuries such ascondominiums _ including a $640,000 apartment at Trump Tower in NewYork, jewlery and designer clothes. Cotten said the money wasapproved by the ministry's founder, Jim Bakker.   In earlier testimony, a representative from a New York City furshop said the Taggarts spent about $35,000 on mink coats and otherfurs for themselves at her store. And a salesman for a New Yorkshoe store said the Taggarts spent nearly $100,000 from 1982-86 onshoes for themselves.   Other testimony included the pair spent $320,000 in fourpurchases at Cartier's jewelry store in New York, including $96,000on one ring. They also took European vacations with friends andfamily, often crossing the Atlantic on a Concord jet.   Cotten said his clients weren't bitter at their former boss forrefusing to testify. Bakker invoked his right againstself-incrimination when he was called to the stand.   Bakker and former PTL executive vice president Richard Dortch goon trial Aug. 28 on charges of wire and mail fraud.   Both Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, would often pleadfor funds on television. Bakker and Dortch were indicted last Dec.5 on charges of conspiring to defraud their supporters by divertingmore than $4 million to support their lavish lifestyles. Ifconvicted, each faces more than 120 years in prison and more than$5 million in fines.   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal afterhe confessed to a sexual affair with former church secretaryJessica Hahn.   The Taggarts joined PTL in the late 1970s as piano players.Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, was Bakker's top personalaide. His brother, James, 35, was the interior designer at PTL'sHeritage USA Christian retreat, just south of Charlotte.   Brown said he would recommend a stiff sentence. Each brotherfaces a maximum of 25 years in prison and more than $1 million infines. Sentencing was set for Aug. 25.</TEXT></DOC>
