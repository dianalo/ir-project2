But many observers worry that the participants in this frenzyracked up short-term gains at the expense of potential long-termpain in the marketplace.   In early December, Jeffrey Applegate, an analyst at theinvestment firm of Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day Inc., calculated thattakeover activity directly accounted for nearly a third of theoverall increase recorded by one widely followed measure of stockprices.   At the time, Standard andamp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocksshowed a 12.91 percent rise since the beginning of the year. Ofthat, Applegate reckoned, 3.7 percentage points stemmed from``takeover stocks.''   Harder to quantify was the amount of the overall increase thatstemmed from buying in ``non-takeover'' stocks based on theexpectation, or hope, that the companies in question might somedaybe bought out at higher prices.   In fact, the takeover game has prompted a significant change inthe way many stock traders and analysts evaluate stocks for theirprofit potential.   Instead of looking at a company's business prospects or itschances for earnings and dividend growth, the new way of gaugingvalue is to try to calculate what a stock might fetch if it were tobecome a takeover target.   Takeover specialists and their advocates say they are acting infavor of all holders of the stocks that get ``put in play.''   After all, they say, when a stock gets caught up in a biddingwar, everybody who owns it gets the benefit of the increase in itsprice, along with the raiders and professional traders known asarbitrage who generate most of the activity.   If anybody has a complaint about this bidding, they argue, itshouldn't be people who have a stake in higher stock prices.   But the many skeptics and critics who have watched as the stakesof the game reached new heights say it almost inevitably will leadto trouble.   If something comes along to curtail or stop the action, such aslegislation to discourage it, an important prop under the stockmarket will be removed.   And if the mania keeps up, they contend, it can only increase thedangers of exessive debt and speculative risk.   With the burgeoning bundle of money and credit being amassed inbuyout funds, ``the result is bound to be too much money chasing toofew good deals,'' said George Putnam III in his Boston-basedinvestment advisory publication The Turnaround Letter.   ``In many ways a leveraged buyout is like buying stock onmargin'' _ in other words, with only a partial down payment, Putnamadded.   ``However, in an LBO you can borrow 90 percent of the purchaseprice, instead of 50 percent when you buy stock on margin.   ``The last time you could buy stock by borrowing 90 percent ofthe purchase price was 1929. Need we say more?''   Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc. say, ``restructuring activityshould extend into 1989, limiting downside risk in the market butalso continuing to alienate traditional investors.   ``At present, there is essentially only one buyer of stocks: Thecorporate insider.   ``Companies that acquire their own stock or the shares of othercompanies, nonmanagement groups that prepare leveraged buyouts andraiders all possess `inside information' of the legal variety. Theyhave more knowledge than does a seller by virtue of who they are.   ``By contrast, traditional investors, both domestic and foreign,are highly skeptical about the process of restructuring companiesand the increased commoditization of U.S. equities. These investorshave therefore retreated from the market.''   Detractors of the buyout wave tend not to mince words. Among theingredients in what he calls a ``recipe for disaster'' in themarket, Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser Charles LaLoggia cites``investment bankers who are leveraging corporate America to thehilt at monstrous interest rates at the height of the economic cyclefor no reason other than the fact these transactions generate hugefees.''   And buyouts by management have drawn some especially pointedobjections.   ``The public has always felt that the market was dominated by thebig players, and program trading reinforced that view,'' saidRaymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.   ``The public has always suspected that the market was manipulatedby insiders, and the Boesky, et al., scandals confirmed that view.   ``Now the public finds that you can't even trust the highly paidmanagement of your company to act in the stockholder's interests.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
