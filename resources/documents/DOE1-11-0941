A test facility with a scale of 10 tons per year wasdeveloped, and the work process was improved by performing a long timetest operation. The test program was divided into: (1) Study on productionof monosilane (2) Study on overall automatic control and efficiency improvement(3) Study to establish an evaluation technology for monosilane. The testresults were as follows: (1) Study on production of monosilane: To confirmthe result of the improvement and modification of the test productionfacility, a short time continuous run was performed electrolyzing atthe current of 3,000 - 5,000 A, and adjustment, capacity, and other testswere carried out, obtaining the following results: Efficiency of electrolyticcurrent (amount of H{sub 2} absorbed in Li/electrolytic current =about90%). efficiency of monosilane production (amount of SiH{sub 4} production/electrolyticcurrent = about 90%) (2) Study on automatic control and efficiency improvement:Automation of reproduction process for the absorption tower, improvementtests for the lithium trap, anti-corrosion tests on welding rods forNi, etc. were carried out. (3) Study on monosilane evaluation technology:Monosilane was evaluated, and a product with a resistance of 200 {Omega}cmwas obtained as compared with the commercialy available pure monosilanehaving the resistance of 1,000 {Omega} (1 fig)</TEXT></DOC>
