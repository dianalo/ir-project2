Up to four people were reported killed duringthe unrest.   The Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation, with about 2million members, ordered the return to work late Friday.   The federation had demanded revocation of price increases of upto 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-board sales tax imposedMonday. It also demanded that salary increases of 50 percent to 300percent, decreed last week for public- and private-sector employees,be retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1 as the government wanted.   In an emergency session Thursday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi'sCabinet met the demands, but the demonstrations and strike continuedand spilled into Friday.   Western military and diplomatic sources cited reports of up tofour dead and more than 26 wounded. The most serious incident was anunexplained shooting in which witnesses said four men firedsubmachine guns from a roof into a protesting crowd.   No arrests were reported.   The focus of the unrest turned to Mahdi's failure to endorse atentative peace accord that the Democratic Unionist Party, a juniorpartner in the coalition Cabinet, signed with southern rebels Nov.16.   The agreement called for a constitutional peace conference to beconvened Dec. 31, with an immediate cease-fire in the 5{-year-oldcivil war and suspension of Islamic law.   The prime minister refused to bring the accord before the Cabinetor the Parliament, fearing it would lead another coalition partner,the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, to quit the government.   The Front opposes any tampering with Islamic law, which isopposed by many of the rebels.   Electricity, water and air and land transportation services weredown during the general strike. Markets were empty, and bread andvegetables disappeared. Both state television and radio were off theair, and telephone and Telex communications were cut.   As the dusty streets of the capital slowly returned to normal,signs of the turmoil remained _ glass shards from smashed carwindshields, pieces of cement blocks and blackened remains of burnedtires.   Khartoum International Airport reopened Friday. Telex lines wererestored this morning, but international telephone operators inCairo, Egypt, said telephone lines were still down.   A Western military source said the army rejected a request byel-Mahdi that army troops join riot police in quelling thedisturbances.   ``There are many angry and frustrated generals in the army,because the constitutional peace conference has not been held asscheduled,'' the military source said. ``Even in the heat of thedemonstrations, they refused to intervene.''   Besides Khartoum, rioting and the general strike hit otherprovincial centers including Port Sudan, Gedaref, Kassala, WadMedani and Atbara.</TEXT></DOC>
