U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen on Wednesday grantedArgentina's request for the extradition of Carlos Suarez Mason. OnMonday, a federal judge here ordered Suarez Mason to pay $21million in damages to a lawyer who was tortured at Argentineprisons under the general's command during the 1970s ``dirty war''against leftists.   Suarez Mason faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.   Jensen rejected Suarez Mason's claim that the crimes for whichhe was wanted in Argentina were political and therefore exempt fromextradition. The exception for political offenses does not apply to``deaths that occurred to disarmed prisoners,'' he said.   ``Suarez Mason has submitted no evidence to implicate any of thehomicide victims in any sort of violent or revolutionaryactivity,'' Jensen said.   ``Thus, there is absolutely nothing in the record which wouldsupport a finding of a rational nexus between the homicides and anyuprising which may have been occurring,'' he said.   Suarez Mason, 64, is not charged with personally committing anyof the killings, but he issued a secret 1977 order making hisoffice responsible for choosing the targets of raids, whose victimswere often kidnapped and killed, Jensen said.   The former general also was responsible for the construction ofdetention centers used to hold civilians, the judge said.   Jensen refused to block extradition while the ruling isappealed, but defense lawyers said they expected to get animmediate stay from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Anappeal could take as long as a year.   ``This is merely a temporary setback,'' said J.T. Prada, one ofSuarez Mason's lawyers. He said Suarez Mason, who listened to aSpanish translation of Wednesday's hearing on a headphone, was ``alittle bit upset; you can't blame him.''   Jensen rejected four other murder charges sought by Argentina,ruling that the victims could not be identified.   Under extradition law, Suarez Mason can be tried only on chargesfor which extradition is approved. The final decision onextradition is up to Secretary of State George Shultz.   ``Justice has been done,'' said Horacio Martinez-Baca, a formerArgentine lawyer who won the $21 million award in his civil suit.Martinez-Baca had been held four years in Suarez Mason's prisonsand tortured.   Two other civil suits by former Argentinians are pending againstSuarez Mason, who contends he has no money.   Suarez Mason was Argentina's most wanted fugitive during histhree years of freedom before his arrest in January 1987 and is thehighest-ranking former military officer currently facing trial bythe civilian government. He was not covered by the amnesty grantedby the government to lower-ranking military officials.   Suarez Mason commanded the First Army Corps and oversaw militaryprisons in the Buenos Aires district from 1976 to 1979.   He was summoned to a military tribunal after a civiliangovernment came to power in late 1983, but fled. He was arrestedlast year in Foster City, south of San Francisco, where he wasliving under an assumed name.   Suarez Mason's lawyers offered two defenses against extradition:that he was not responsible for his soldiers' actions; and that theactions were ``political,'' and therefore exempt from extraditionunder the U.S.-Argentina treaty, because they were in response toalleged threats of a leftist takeover.   Defense lawyers offered evidence of numerous attacks againstgovernment and military installations and business leaders, beforeand after the 1976 military coup.</TEXT></DOC>
