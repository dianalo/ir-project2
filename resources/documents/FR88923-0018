Stuhldreher, GeneralCounsel, National Transportation Safety Board, 800 Independence Avenue,SW., Washington, DC 20594 (202-382-6540).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 311 of the Airport and AirwaySafety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-223 (December 30,1987) amended section 304 (a)(6) of the Independent Safety Board Act of1974 (49 U.S.C. 1903(a)(6)) to empower the Board to establish regulationsrequiring persons to report accidents and aviation incidents involvingpublic aircraft other than aircraft of the Armed Forces and the IntelligenceAgencies. Section 311 required the Board within 18 months of its enactmentto report to the Congress the Board's findings on public aircraft accidentsand incidents.Section 830.1 regarding the applicability of Part 830 is being amendedto reflect the expanded coverage of the rule to include the reporting ofaccidents and incidents involving public aircraft. Former paragraph (b)of andSection; 830.1 is redesignated as paragraph (c) and a new paragraph(b) is added for the reporting of public aircraft accidents and incidents.Civil aircraft and public aircraft are defined in the Federal AviationAct of 1958, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1301, and the statutory definitionsof these terms are being added to andSection; 830.2. It should be noted thatsection 207 of the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Actof 1987 amended the definition of public aircraft by adding a new sentenceexpressing the meaning of the phrase ``used exclusively in the serviceof''. The definition of public aircraft which is being added to andSection;830.2 includes the foregoing amendment.A new Subpart E (andSection; 830.20) is being added to Part 830, and it requiresoperators of public aircraft except the Armed Forces and Intelligence Agenciesto report accidents and covered incidents. Under andSection; 830.20, theoperator of the public aircraft must file a report of the accident or listedincident within 10 days which is the same filing period as the one foraccidents involving civil aircraft. The report is to be filed on a preprintedform which is available from any of the Board's field offices in Anchorage,AK; Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; Fort Worth, TX; Kansas City,MO; Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; New York, NY; and Seattle, WA, the NationalTransportation Safety Board, Washington, DC 20594; and the Federal AviationAdministration, Flight Standards District Offices. This reporting provisionwill enable the Board to obtain the requisite data to comply with the legislativedirective to report to Congress on public aircraft accidents and incidents.The Board's statutory mandate to investigate aircraft accidents is confinedto accidents involving civil aircraft, and this regulatory revision doesnot authorize the Board to investigate public aircrat accidents. Nor doesthis revision, as would be the case for civil aircraft, require the immediatenotification of public aircraft accidents or the preservation of wreckage,cargo, etc. Instead, the revision to Part 830 only requires the reportingof accidents and incidents concerning certain public aircraft.The changes made in this revision merely provide the mechanism for theBoard to obtain the information essential to comply with the legislativedirective that the Board submit a report to Congress on public aircraft.Since the revision embodies a straightforward implementation of the Board'snew authority to require the reporting of public aircraft accidents andincidents, public comment on this revision before its adoption is not likelyto be helpful. In addition, public comment would postpone the receipt ofinformation on public aircraft accidents and incidents which would reducethe data available for the Board's report to the Congress. Therefore, theBoard has decided to dispense with a notice of proposed rulemaking. TheBoard welcomes and will carefully consider comments that are received,and any required changes in the rule will be made.Under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board has determinedthat this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities particularly because the costs of reporting willbe minimal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 830</ITAG>Aviation safety, Postal service, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, 49 CFR Part 830 of the Board's rules is revised to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 830_NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING OF AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTSAND OVERDUE AIRCRAFT, AND PRESERVATION OF AIRCRAFT WRECKAGE, MAIL, CARGO,AND RECORDS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.1 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Initial Notification of Aircraft Accidents, Incidents, andOverdue Aircraft</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.5 Immediate notification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.6 Information to be given in notification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Preservation of Aircraft Wreckage, Mail, Cargo, and Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.10 Preservation of aircraft wreckage, mail, cargo, and records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Reporting of Aircraft Accidents, Incidents, and OverdueAircraft</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.15 Reports and statement to be filed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Reporting of Public Aircraft Accidents and Incidents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">830.20 Reports to be filed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 U.S.C. 1441 and 1901 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 830.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>This part contains rules pertaining to:(a) Notification and reporting aircraft accidents and incidents and certainother occurrences in the operation of aircraft when they involve civilaircraft of the United States wherever they occur, or foreign civil aircraftwhen such events occur in the United States, its territories or possessions.(b) Reporting aircraft accidents and listed incidents in the operationof aircraft when they involve certain public aircraft.(c) Preservation of aircraft wreckage, mail, cargo, and records involvingall civil aircraft in the United States, its territories or possessions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 830.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this part the following words or phrases are defined as follows:``Aircraft accident'' means an occurrence associated with the operationof an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards theaircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked,and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which theaircraft receives substantial damage.``Civil aircraft'' means any aircraft other than a public aircraft.``Fatal injury'' means any injury which results in death within 30 daysof the accident.``Incident'' means an occurrence other than an accident, associated withthe operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safetyof operations.``Operator'' means any person who causes or authorizes the operation ofan aircraft, such as the owner, lessee, or bailee of an aircraft.``Public aircraft'' means an aircraft used exclusively in the service ofany government or of any political subdivision thereof, including the governmentof any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or the Districtof Columbia, but not including any government-owned aircraft engaged incarrying persons or property for commercial purposes.
