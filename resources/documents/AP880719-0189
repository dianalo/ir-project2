DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The next president likely will face``accelerating deterioration'' of stability in Central Americaunless U.S. policy-makers find a consensus on helping theNicaraguan rebels, President Reagan's national security advisersaid Tuesday.   In a rare speaking appearance, Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell told aforeign affairs audience that the battle over Nicaraguan policy inthe United States is reminiscent of divisiveness in the Vietnam Warera. He called Central America ``an area of latent crisis.''   In a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Powellsaid that ``when we are united _ as we have been in support of theAfghan freedom fighters, or of a solid NATO, or of a new basis forU.S.-Soviet relations, or of a vital commitment in the (Persian)gulf, we can achieve a great deal.''   ``But recent history also teaches that when we are divided overtactics _ as in Central America _ our policy suffers grievously andour national interest does too,'' Powell said.   In answering questions after his speech, Powell said that he isencouraged by Iran's announcement Monday that it would accept aU.N. cease-fire resolution in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.   ``It is a breakthrough, in my judgment, but it is only a firststep,'' Powell said in answer to questions from the council. ``Thewar goes on. It goes on right now, today.''   Asked if the U.S. naval presence would be withdrawn from thePersian Gulf if the cease-fire does stick, Powell said it did not.   ``We have had vessels in the Persian Gulf since 1949,'' he said.``Because of the importance of that waterway and because of ourstrategic interest in the region, I do not see us ever removing ourforces from the Persian Gulf.''   He added that if there were no longer threats to neutralshipping in the gulf, ``we could review our force structure andadjust it accordingly.''   Powell's comments on Central America came in the wake of actionsby Col. Enrique Bermudez to consolidate leadership of the Contrarebel force, and renewed diplomatic tensions between the UnitedStates and Nicaragua, who have expelled several of each other'senvoys.   The administration has signaled that it supports a billintroduced by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., which, amongother things, would include $20 million in military assistance tobe held in escrow for the president's use against the Sandinistaregime in Managua.   In his speech, Powell said that ``unless Congress and thepresident ... come to agreement on a program of effective aid forthe Nicaraguan resistance as an adjunct to our diplomatic strategy,the next president will probably face a situation of acceleratingdeterioration, as all the local democracies will come under growingstrains as Nicaragua grows stronger, more assertive and moreaggressive.''   ``Last week, you all saw the reaction of the Sandinista regimeto legitimate political protest,'' Powell said, referring to theshutdowns of a newspaper and radio station and the expulsion ofAmerican Ambassador Richard Melton, who was accused of engaging inactivities undermining the state.   ``Can there be any further doubt about the totalitarian natureof the ruling junta in Managua?'' Powell asked.   On other subjects, the national security adviser said:   _The administration has recovered from the ``aberration ofIran-Contra.''   Powell said administration officials are working harder to keepmembers of Congress informed of sensitive national security matters.   _He plans to return to active duty in the Army when Reagan'sterm ends next January.   ``I expect to go back to a nice quiet foxhole where I can servemy country in a more comfortable and perhaps less exposedposition,'' he said.   _The American people ``clearly do not want to see a repetitionof the period of military weakness that we went through in the wakeof the Vietnam War.''</TEXT></DOC>
