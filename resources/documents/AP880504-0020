The Wistar Institute announced a proposal Tuesday to test thevaccine this fall on an island that will be selected off the coastof either Virginia or South Carolina. The experiment, said Wistarofficials, is part of an international plan to eradicate rabies, adisease that has plagued humans and animals since ancient times.   Charles Rupprecht, an assistant professor at Wistar, said thevaccine, in a liquid form, would be placed into baits designed toattract wild raccoons. The baits then would be distributed on theselected island.   Later, he said, captured raccoons would be examined to determineif they have eaten the bait and become immune to rabies.   William H. Wunner, a Wistar professor, said the baits wouldconsist of a sponge filled with the vaccine and then sealed with awax. The baits would be coated with a scent as an attractant.   He said laboratory tests have shown that when raccoons bite intothe baits they absorb the vaccine through the lining of theirmouths.   Rupprecht said the process has been shown to be effective intests on thousands of animals of 15 different species in thelaboratory.   The test would be the first U.S. use in the wild of a virus madewith recombinant DNA technology. But the same vaccine now is beingused in field tests on foxes in Belgium and will start soon inFrance. Other types of rabies vaccines have been used in fieldtests in West Germany and in Canada.   Warren Cheston, associated director of Wistar, said theengineered vaccine was made by removing one of five genes from therabies virus and splicing it into the genetic pattern of thevaccinia virus, which is the virus used to make smallpox vaccinesfor human innoculations.   Cheston said that because the technology uses a harmless genefrom the rabies virus, the resulting vaccine cannot cause rabies.But, when put into an animal's immune system, the vaccine willcause the animal to develop antibodies to the rabies virus, thusmaking the animal immune to the disease.   Wistar has applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture forapproval to conduct the tests. Wistar Institute, located inPhiladelphia, is an independent, non-profit biomedical researchlaboratory.   Repprecht said the islands under consideration for the test areParramore Island, Va., and North, Cedar or Murphy Islands on thecoast of South Carolina. These islands are uninhabited by humans,but do have a population of raccoons. The South Carolina islandsare part of a wildlife refuge. He said he hopes that the test canget under way this fall.   Rabies is a viral infection that can infect any warm-bloodedanimal. It attacks the central nervous system and always is fatalunless a vaccine is administered shortly after exposure.   A survey by the World Health Organization shows that more than20,000 humans die annually from rabies and that more than a halfmillion receive post-exposure injections. About 30,000 people inthe United States receive the rabies vaccine annually. The Centersfor Disease Control reported rabies in more than 4,000 animals inthe U.S. last year, but no human cases developed.   Current rabies vaccines must be administered by injection, butCheston said it is hoped that eventually a genetically-engineeredvaccine that can be taken orally will be made, tested and clearedfor human use. The oral rabies vaccine now being tested can be usedonly on animals, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
