(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The liftoff of space shuttleColumbia scheduled for Thursday will be delayed again because oflagging work at the launch pad, sources said Saturday.   The mission to launch and retrieve a satellite has already beenpostponed twice. No new date will be set until shuttle managersmeet Monday, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has notofficially changed the liftoff set for 6:04 p.m. Thursday.   The new date could be Friday or Saturday. But NASA has said thatif it can't launch by Saturday, it would delay the effort until atleast Dec. 27 to free workers for the Christmas holiday.   The sources said there is a possibility the flight could be putoff until New Year's Day to give workers a longer holiday and topermit an annual electrical inspection of space center facilitiesplanned during the last week of each year.   The launch had been scheduled for this Monday, but lastWednesday NASA postponed it by two days. On Friday, it delayed thelaunch another day.   The delays have been caused by unfinished work on launch pad39A, which hasn't been used for a shuttle launch in nearly fouryears. A two-year, $50 million refurbishment of the complex wasrecently completed, and technicians have not finished checkingseveral systems, such as ground lines that carry fuel to theshuttle.   Some tiny fuel leaks and other minor problems have turned up,slowing work.   A new mobile launch platform is being used for the first time,and checking some of its systems has taken longer than anticipated.   During 10 days in space, Columbia's five astronauts are torelease a communications satellite for the Navy, then track downand retrieve a large science satellite that has been orbiting Earthfor six years.</TEXT></DOC>
