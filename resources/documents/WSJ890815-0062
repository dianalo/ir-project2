Both in the seedy 1930s-style business district and in overcrowded back alleys, a visitor finds that, unlike Beijing's subdued populace, many Shanghainese openly express resentment against the government and wonder where their lingering spirit of rebellion will lead them.    Outside a twin-screen downtown theater, scalpers are doing a thriving business for a sold-out afternoon movie. Most posters for the day's offerings portray a young Deng Xiaoping on horseback in a striped jacket, leading his army into battle. &quot;Baise Uprising,&quot; named after a town in Guangxi province, has top billing, but it is hardly the main attraction. The young men buying the scalpers' tickets aren't interested in the film about the Chinese Communist revolution. They are here, a tout explains, to see an Italian thriller. &quot;Look, this is an action movie,&quot; one says. &quot;'Baise Uprising' is a political movie. No one wants to see it.&quot;    The disdain for propaganda and the willingness to state this openly are typical of this outspoken city of more than 12 million people. A visitor walking Shanghai's hot, crowded streets hears strong opinions on plenty of other subjects as well: democracy, corruption, sky-high inflation, unemployment, even honest praise for the city fathers.    Barely 10 weeks after the Shanghai government used tough talk and worker brigades -- not tanks and automatic weapons -- to clear tens of thousands of young demonstrators from downtown streets, the city carries on as before. Just about the only people here who don't want to talk these days are the foreign businessmen. The city's foreign community is back in force, but traders and joint-venture managers have little desire to talk with a reporter. Wary of angering the Chinese government, and concerned about attracting attention back home while China's crackdown remains in the news, most decline to be interviewed. Shanghai's openness contrasts sharply with Beijing under martial law, where troops still guard key intersections around the clock. A stranger wandering the capital's streets by day finds that nobody will speak his mind, and even at night the fears that spring from the early-June bloodshed choke most conversations.    &quot;There was confrontation in Beijing, so the government dealt the people a hard blow,&quot; a university professor in Shanghai says. &quot;Here the blow wasn't so hard, so our spirit is good.&quot;    The government certainly struck some blows in Shanghai. Demonstrators accused of violence in the streets have received long prison sentences, and there have been executions, including three young men shot to death for burning a train. Arrests of student activists are rumored, though none has been announced. Some well-known intellectuals have disappeared or been placed under house arrest. The city's most outspoken newspaper, the World Economic Herald, was shut down.    But some here wonder how long Shanghai will remain quiet. The college campuses are deserted, but students will begin returning next week for several days of political study. The anger felt by other young people hasn't subsided. The searing August heat brings this city out into the streets at night in search of relief.    In a neighborhood of narrow alleys near Shanghai's waterfront, hundreds of people relax in bamboo-slatted deck chairs by the curbside. It is impossible to walk more than a few blocks without being invited to share cigarettes, beer or even a meal. Discontented young men clad in shorts and sandals gather at every stop to air the same complaints over and over.    &quot;Shanghai is no good,&quot; one declares loudly. &quot;There's no freedom. There's no democracy. There are no jobs. Our work is what we can find in the streets, what we can split among ourselves.&quot;    After the young men move on, a 35-year-old man named Liu, who works as a government researcher, leans back in his chair and sighs. &quot;They are unhappy because they have no work,&quot; he says. &quot;There's a great distance here between the unemployed and the government.&quot;    A constant refrain to Shanghai life is that inflation -- currently in double digits -- has placed many goods out of reach. In a quiet tree-lined street that once housed this city's European elite before the revolution, the proprietor of a small bar ticks off the things that are no longer easily affordable for workers: fish, meat, chicken and eggs. &quot;You used to be able to buy everything cheap, even though you made less money,&quot; she says. &quot;Now you can't.&quot;    Shanghai witnessed several large pro-democracy demonstrations in May, though none came near the size of the million-strong rallies that filled Beijing's Tiananmen Square. After the killings in Beijing, young demonstrators in Shanghai hijacked buses and trucks and paralyzed the city for several days before dispersing. Unlike in Beijing, where people of all ages joined the movement, Shanghai's protesters were primarily young people. Workers with jobs and families largely stayed on the sidelines. &quot;It's like this,&quot; says a 26-year-old taxi driver, who owns his own dilapidated Eastern European-made cab. &quot;If you had money, you didn't participate. If you had no money, you were the movement. Those people with no place in society were there. Me? I was there, but I only watched. I have a wife.&quot;    The Shanghai government took advantage of this hesitancy to end the blockades after about five days. Mayor Zhu Rongji went on television on June 8 to announce that the city government had never considered sending in the army and declared it was time to go back to work. Late that night, the government dispatched tens of thousands of factory workers to clear the streets. Some analysts believe that Shanghai's party secretary, Jiang Zemin, was promoted later that month to general-secretary of the Chinese Communist Party because of the effective way the Shanghai rebellion was quelled.    But it is Mayor Zhu who has won respect in the streets. His approach &quot;was very pragmatic, and Shanghai people respond to pragmatism,&quot; a Western diplomat says. &quot;He came out looking great.&quot;    In effect, the mayor, who earlier this month also was appointed general-secretary of the party in Shanghai, bought the government time. Older Shanghainese recognize that many of China's problems can't be easily solved, yet everyone is demanding results soon. They most want results from the government in dealing with official corruption. Popular resentment can only grow if the government fails to tackle the problem.    Some Shanghai residents looked skeptically upon the student movement's demands for democracy, believing that the Communist Party was little inclined to loosen the reins. But the demands for an end to corruption struck a common chord because of the widespread resentment against officials at all levels who engage in profiteering and influence-peddling.    &quot;Party officials have power, so they can do the things they want,&quot; says a 43-year-old man, who sympathized with the students but didn't join them. &quot;We working people have no power, so there's nothing we can do. If the government doesn't deal with corruption, then we'll be upset.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
