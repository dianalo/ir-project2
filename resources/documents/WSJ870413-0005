YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT CSABANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two banks in Utah and Indiana were closed, bringing the number of bank failures this year to 59, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.    In arranging the disposition of one of the banks, Bank of Iron County, Parowan, Utah, the FDIC used a new technique in which the agency essentially paid the institution that purchased the failed bank to take all of the loans, including the bad ones.    This should be less costly for the FDIC than the agency's usual practice of purchasing the bad loans itself, according to FDIC officials who hope the transaction will serve as a model for future bank failures.    Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board acted on two insolvent savings and loan institutions it had controlled.    The Bank Board approved the purchase of Central Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Diego, by Coast Savings andamp; Loan Association, Los Angeles. Before the transaction, Central had assets of $1.7 billion and Coast, a state-chartered stock association, had assets of $9.2 billion and 93 offices throughout California.    The Bank Board had taken control of Central in May 1985. To facilitate the transaction, the Bank Board will make a capital contribution, which wasn't disclosed, to Coast and indemnify the thrift against liabilities, which also weren't disclosed, and litigation that might result from the transaction.    The Bank Board also closed Summit Savings andamp; Loan Association, Park City, Utah, and transferred its insured deposits totaling $115.9 million to United Savings andamp; Loan Association of Ogden, Utah. United is a $215 million-asset institution with nine offices in Utah and one in Idaho.    Summit had been under the Bank Board's control since last April. The Bank Board retained the failed thrift's assets of $120.8 million for liquidation. United will serve customers of the failed thrift at the Park City office for two weeks before closing that facility. All depositors of Summit automatically become depositors of United.    Bank of Iron County's three offices, closed by state regulators, are to reopen today as branches of Dixie State Bank, St. George, Utah. In addition to assuming the $19.9 million the failed bank held in 6,300 deposit accounts, Dixie agreed to purchase all of the failed bank's assets, valued at $20.1 million, for about $16.5 million.    In the past, the FDIC usually sold a failed bank to another institution along with the good loans, received a purchase premium from the acquiring bank and retained the bad loans to salvage if the agency could. But the bad loans were usually settled at a loss and the agency had to bear the cost of maintaining the assets until they were disposed of.    Under this new technique, the FDIC calculates how much it would expect to lose by retaining the bad loans and offers the purchasing bank a discount if it will take all of the assets and waives its purchase premium.    The borrowers of the failed bank should also benefit because their loans will remain in the banking system rather than being held by a federal agency that can't extend credit.    Bank of Iron County was the first bank to fail this year in Utah.    The FDIC arranged the transfer of the insured deposits of the other bank, Citizens State Bank, Brownstown, Ind., because agency officials were unable to determine the quality of the failed bank's loans.    The insured deposits of Citizens State were transferred to Monroe County Bank,, Bloomington, Ind. The funds are to be available at the failed bank's three offices, which are to reopen today as branches of Monroe County Bank.    Citizens State had assets of $30.8 million and held deposits of $28.1 million in 7,200 accounts. It was the third bank to fail this year in Indiana. </TEXT></DOC>
