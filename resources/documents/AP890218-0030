Baker III is new to diplomacy, but helearned fast on his first overseas trip as secretary of state not tochallenge friends or foes,   Baker hopped nimbly through the 15 countries that are joined withthe United States in the NATO alliance without touching a sensitivenerve.   Baker briefed President Bush on the trip by phone on Saturday andwill meet with him personally Sunday for a more detailed report,according to White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Bush is spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at CampDavid, Md.   ``The president reviewed at length with the secretary a varietyof issues that had been discussed with the allies, including thegenerally shared view that East-West relations are now clearlyproceeding on the basis of the West's agenda,'' Fitzwater said in astatement.   ``The president expressed his conviction that NATO unity isstrong and his confidence that the allies will move together inaddressing the major questions of international stability,''Fitzwater said.   Baker operated most effectively behind the scenes as White Housechief of staff and Treasury Secretary in the Reagan administrationand then as President Bush's 1988 election campaign chairman.   Critics of the Bush campaign's tactics, especially its roughattack on liberals and prisoner-release policies, rarely took aim atBaker.   Baker took the same subdued style with him to Canada and toWestern Europe. Just for a moment, on the flight home on Friday, heshowed a touch of emotion concerning his decision to sell his stockin a New York bank.   He owned the shares because of a merger involving a Texas bankfounded by his grandfather.   ``My grandfather would be turning over in his grave,'' he said.   And yet, characteristically, when ethical questions were raisedat the White House _ the bank holds $4.5 billion in Third World debtthat could be affected by State Department decisions _ Baker put outthe fire quickly.   He ordered trustees to sell all of his publicly traded stock aswell as that held by his wife, Susan, and their daughter, MaryBonner Baker, to avoid any appearance of an ethical conflict.   On policy issues and on terrorism Baker was as reserved in hissoft East Texas drawl as any of his Eastern predecessors.   He artfully avoided a showdown with touchy West German leaders onnuclear weapons and on the help German firms gave Libya in buildinga chemical weapons plant.   Baker did not try to talk Chancellor Helmut Kohl out of hisproposal, backed also by Denmark, to postpone the upgrading ofNATO's battlefield Lance missiles.   Instead, they agreed to try to work out a compromise at the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting being planned for lateMay in Brussels.   Baker let it be known he was aware of the political problemsconfronting Kohl, a conservative who faces elections in 1990 in acountry with growing disarmament tendencies.   Nor was there any public criticism from Baker of the help WestGerman firms gave Libya as it tried to develop chemical weapons.   The Germans, who first denied the charges as exaggerations by theAmerican media, have tightened export controls and promised toprosecute violators. Baker let it rest at that.   In The Hague, Baker was confronted with an appeal from DutchForeign Minister Hans van den Broek that he take the advice ofFrench, Greek and Spanish foreign ministers who toured the MiddleEast as a European Community ``troika'' and plunge into Arab-Israelidiplomacy.   Baker politely declined, saying the time was not right and thatpremature U.S. intervention could destroy whatever moves towardpeace talks may be developing.   He told the West Europeans he did not have ``any time line'' totake action,   And yet, Baker tactfully agreed to have American diplomats takesoundings among the Israelis, Arabs and the Palestine LiberationOrganization. He promised to report back to the West Europeanforeign ministers when they attend the opening of arms controlnegotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna next month.   Even on terrorism, where George P. Shultz, his predecessor assecretary of state, struck a high profile by vehemently denouncingthe latest outrages, Baker was careful and subdued.   He called it ``regrettable'' that a British author had beenthreatened with death by Islamic fundamentalists for publishing abook they considered blasphemous.   Reporters traveling with Baker were told by a self-styled seniorU.S. official that ``it does not do a lot of good if you areinterested in suppressing terrorism to fan the fires.''   Throughout his eight-day trip Baker projected a cool, confidentreserve.   And yet, Baker reads what is written about him. Reports fromWashington that Brent Scowcroft, the assistant to Bush for nationalsecurity affairs, was crowding him on foreign policy were dismissedas ``ludicrous.''   The procedure for holding White House discussions on issues thatspan the State Department, the Pentagon and other agencies has beenchanged to permit Scowcroft to preside.   But reporters were told Baker was not concerned, that he hasknown Bush and Scowcroft too long to worry about being eclipsed.   They were also admonished not to overplay the disagreement withthe West Germans as a ``schism.'' And he questioned reports that hehad not informed Senate committees of his bank holdings.   Obviously, Baker cares a lot about what the media say about him.   He has abandoned Shultz's policy of putting all his remarks onthe record. Baker held two news conferences aboard his plane, butmost of the time reporters were given so-called ``backgroundbriefings'' in which they were prevented from identifying thespeaker.   Baker also has expanded his public relations contingent. WhileSecretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in the 1970s took a singlespokesman along and Shultz added an assistant, Baker is the first tohave a staff of three looking after the press.   He reduced his security detail, at the same time, and found seatson his Air Force jet for 17 reporters _ a new high.</TEXT></DOC>
