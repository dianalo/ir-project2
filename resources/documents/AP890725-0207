Khashoggi, 53, once among the world's wealthiest men, has beenjailed since he was extradited from Switzerland last Wednesday.   ``The court recognizes that no precautions, including pretrialdetention, ever conclusively guarantee a defendant's presence attrial,'' wrote U.S. District Judge John Keenan in his ruling. But,the judge said, the court believed the ``substantial bail'' and therestrictions of his freedom would assure that Khashoggi wouldappear at trial.   Keenan also said Khashoggi was unlikely to flee because it wouldhave a ``ruinous impact upon his ability to conduct business.''   His lawyer, Robert Morvillo, said Tuesday enough money had beenraised to meet the bail but that paperwork prevented Khashoggi'simmediate release from the Metropolitan Correctional Center inManhattan.   The following conditions to Khashoggi's release were imposed bythe judge:   _ The posting of a $10 million bond, half of which will besecured by cash or bank books and the other half by property or abond. The bond is to have two ``financially secure'' co-signers,one of whom is to be his brother, Essam Khashoggi.   _ Khashoggi's movements will be monitored by federal marshalswith an unremovable electronic bracelet attached to his wrist orankle.   _ He is to report twice a week in person and daily by phone toofficials.   _ Khashoggi must surrender his passport and stay within thesouthern district of New York, which includes Manhattan and itsnorthern suburbs, pending the outcome of the case.   In setting the high bail, the judge said Khashoggi was an``enormously wealthy man'' who ``possesses the means to procurestaggering amounts of cash in fewer than 24 hours.''   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi, theMarcoses, five other people and the California Overseas Bank in LosAngeles last October. The ousted president and his wife werecharged with stealing more than $100 million from the Philippinetreasury to buy real estate and art in New York.   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of theassets as a cover, was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy, mailfraud and obstruction of justice.   He was extradited only for mail fraud and obstruction of justicebecause the Swiss government denied extradition on the othercharges, which are not recognized under Swiss law.   Khashoggi faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine oneach of the two charges.   He is said to have been the main financier and middleman of theIran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret U.S. arms sales toIran were channeled to rebels fighting the leftist Sandinistagovernment in Nicaragua.   Khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals, buthis arrest in Switzerland on April 18 marked the first time he hadbeen jailed.   Prosecutors say the earliest trial date for Khashoggi and hisco-defendants would be January or February.</TEXT></DOC>
