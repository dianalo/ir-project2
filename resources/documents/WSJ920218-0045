The commission voted unanimously last week to drop arequirement that sponsors of all televised political adsidentify themselves in the ads orally. The campaigncommittees of both political parties complained that theaudio requirement left little time for candidates' pitches.</LP><TEXT>   Political ads still must contain video identification ofsponsors. The agency specified that visual identificationmust air for at least four seconds and that the letters mustbe at least 4% of the height of the TV picture. The earlierdecision didn't spell out the size or duration. Thecommission also said that advertisers don't have to complywith the new standards until April 1, allowing them to aircommercials that have already been produced.   The agency's action drew immediate criticism from Peoplefor the American Way and Media Access Project, which havebeen fighting for more than a year for more disclosure ofgroups who pay for so-called attack ads. &quot;In their haste tosatisfy the political parties, the commission cut the publicout of the process altogether,&quot; said Andrew Jay Schwartzman,executive director of Media Access Project, aWashington-based public interest law firm.</TEXT></DOC>
