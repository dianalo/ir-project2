According to Edward Hennessy Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, the appointment signals an end to an acquisition and divestiture binge that analysts said has confused investors in recent years about the company's direction. Mr. Belzer said in an interview that the company has now completed its transition into three &quot;highly focused&quot; businesses -- aerospace, automotive and engineered materials -- and his task will be to &quot;get our profitability up.&quot;    &quot;We're already making good money and we think there's opportunity to make more,&quot; he said. Last year Allied-Signal earned $655 million, or $3.90 a share, up 20% from a year earlier, on sales of $11.12 billion.    The post of president had been vacant since November 1985, when Michael Dingman resigned to head Henley Group Inc., a collection of 35 companies Allied-Signal spun off after Allied acquired Signal Cos. that year. Mr. Hennessy, the company's architect who put together Allied-Signal through aggressive acquisitions, said his own timetable called for appointing someone to the No. 2 job this year or next. &quot;We have simply reached a stage of growth where we need to concentrate on the running of these operations,&quot; he said.    Mr. Belzer, 55 years old, who has been president of the company's engineered materials operations, was chosen over two other candidates who run larger divisions, both of which posted a lackluster performance last year. &quot;Mr. Belzer has demonstrated year after year his ability to improve profitability,&quot; said Mr. Hennessy, 60.    Mr. Hennessy said that with the day-to-day running of operations left to Mr. Belzer, he will concentrate his time &quot;on globalization&quot; of Allied-Signal's businesses. He said the company has done &quot;a very good job&quot; of branching into international markets in its automotive business and that the company will pursue the same strategies in the aerospace business.    Mr. Belzer, who also will become a director, declined to discuss his specific plans. But he gave the flavor of his intentions by citing his reputation at the company. &quot;I'm a grower of business and I'm a weeder-out of what's not good, and I'm a reducer of costs, and I'm a driver of productivity,&quot; he said. &quot;Productivity improvement and cost reductions will be an important part of my job,&quot; he said, &quot;but not the only focus.&quot;    Wall Street analysts greeted Mr. Belzer's appointment as a potential palliative for the poor performance of Allied-Signal's stock in recent years. Since the beginning of last year, it has lagged the Sandamp;P 400 average by 30%. Lawrence Lytton, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said Mr. Belzer's appointment indicates &quot;a major focus on improving earnings per share. Hennessy isn't the man for that job.&quot;    Allied-Signal's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $31 a share, down 50 cents.    Mr. Belzer said he will be addressing a major criticism of analysts: the company's heavy research and development spending. Last year, the company spent more than $1.25 billion on research and development, of which $500 million was reimbursed by the government. &quot;We have to have a better balance between short-term and long-term goals,&quot; said Mr. Hennessy. He said Mr. Belzer, to whom the company's technology group will report, &quot;will re-examine research and development spending across the board. &quot;Some projects may not pay off,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
