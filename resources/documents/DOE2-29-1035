<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-29-1035 </DOCNO><TEXT>A comprehensive literature review is presented of the effects of aciddeposition on the environment, with special reference to Alberta. Anintroduction to atmospheric chemistry and acid deposition processes beginsthis review. Separate sections are then given on the effects of aciddeposition on specific areas: forests, including direct and indirecteffects, canopy-pollutant interactions, interactive effects, timber harvesting,tree reproduction, and plant communities; agriculture, including foliarinjury and direct foliar effects, and direct and combined effects ofsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, and dry and wet acids; geologyand hydrogeology, including groundwater acidification and human impacts;surface water, including factors influencing surface water acidification,effects on aquatic biota, and acidification modelling; soils, includingsoil reactions, natural acidification, and nutrient availability; andsoil microorganisms and microbially mediated processes, including oxidationand reduction reactions, and sulfur microbiology. A review is also madeof numerical models of air pollutant exposure and vegetation response,and of acidic deposition in the Alberta context. 813 refs., 11 figs.,45 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
