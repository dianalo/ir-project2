The central-bank official offers a smile -- but little else. She can't give him the figures. The state oil company, she explains, is &quot;very cautious about giving us that information.&quot;    Mr. Levy sighs, but he isn't surprised. Economic forecasting is never easy, and his job is one of the toughest: He gets paid to decipher the economic health of Latin American countries. Based in New York for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Mr. Levy deals with Third World countries where government statistics are unavailable or incomplete and misleading. He analyzes political trends in nations where politics is played out largely in the shadows, affecting economic growth in ways that can only be surmised. He is, in short, part number cruncher and part political scientist, part detective and part diviner.    Some companies, especially commercial banks, have trimmed their economic staffs in recent years to cut costs. But many U.S. companies, from commercial banks and investment banks to manufacturers and marketers, consider economists crucial, basing countless business decisions on their opinions.    Within Merrill Lynch, for instance, the foreign-exchange department considers Mr. Levy's opinions in its trading of currencies. The division that oversees accounts of private Latin individuals uses Mr. Levy's analyses to keep clients abreast of the outlook for Latin America and investment opportunities. And about 35 multinational companies that invest in Latin America use Mr. Levy as a consultant, for advice on formulating investment strategy.    Economists' jobs are potentially most important in situations like the international debt crisis a few years ago. Some U.S. bankers and corporations say that if they had realized just how much some countries were in hock and just how fragile their economies were, they would have curtailed their lending and investing sooner. In 1982, for instance, when Mexico nearly defaulted on its foreign debt, neither Mexico nor its creditor banks knew how much the country had borrowed. And it wasn't until the Philippines was forced to reschedule its debt in 1983 that bankers discovered the country had for months overstated its foreign-currency reserves in order to appear healthier and attract bank loans and foreign investment.    Debtors and creditors are trying to keep better tabs these days, and the data have improved. But tough problems remain, says Gregory Fager, a senior economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C. &quot;There's a host of problems with numbers being prepared by most of the countries,&quot; he says. Furthermore, he adds, the disparate reporting systems of international banks make suspect the data gathered by creditor institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, the Switzerland-based central bankers' bank.    Private economists try to fill in the gaps. A recent three-day trip to Venezuela with Mr. Levy shows just how hard that can be. The trip is a collection of interviews, with some proving worthless and others giving only hints or vague confirmations of what has been happening in the country. But Mr. Levy hopes most interviews will provide pieces to his Venezuelan puzzle by the end of the three days.    Venezuela is indeed puzzling to Mr. Levy before his trip. He has only vague impressions of the economic climate here.    The 39-year-old Mr. Levy has a doctoral degree in economics from the University of Chicago, and he spent two years covering Latin America for New York's Citibank before he joined Merrill Lynch almost six years ago. This trip marks his 15th or so visit to Venezuela, but he hasn't been here in a year, and telephone communication, meanwhile, has been difficult at best. Much of his evidence is abstract and sketchy. Still, he says, he is &quot;edgy&quot; about the economy.    The statistics don't tell him much. Basic indicators either don't exist or are compiled too late to be of much use. There are no published monthly or quarterly trade figures, no disclosures of the total output of goods and services, and no comprehensive figures on government spending.    &quot;There's a lot of guesswork&quot; in interpreting the numbers, Mr. Levy says. &quot;That's when it becomes an intelligence game. You have to find out by other means.&quot;    Those other means are interviews with about 15 businessmen, foreign bankers in Caracas, foreign-exchange dealers, local economists, reporters and government officials. His agenda is clear: He wants to know whether Venezuela is veering away from the conservative economic and fiscal policies it has followed the past six years and toward expansionary policies that could drain the country's hard-currency reserves, produce a government budget deficit and fuel inflation.    He also wants to investigate how changes in the foreign-investment laws and a planned reform of the labor law will affect businesses. And he wants to learn of any signs that Venezuela, like Mexico, plans to allow creditors to swap debt for equity in Venezuelan entities to reduce the country's $35 billion debt burden.    &quot;I'll ask the same question 20 times over,&quot; Mr. Levy says. &quot;The most important thing on these visits is often to know where each person stands, what bias each person has.&quot;    At 11 a.m. on his first day in Caracas, Mr. Levy is sitting in the office of Carlton Prunhuber, who writes a newsletter on the Venezuelan economy. He has observed in advance that Mr. Prunhuber is &quot;always screaming bloody murder -- the world is coming to an end.&quot; So he isn't surprised when Mr. Prunhuber warns that the Venezuelan government's economic policies are &quot;going to lead to disaster.&quot; But Mr. Prunhuber does drop an interesting tidbit: Venezuela, he thinks, has exhausted its reserves of its currency, the bolivar. If that is true, Mr. Levy believes, the government will have to print more money to finance its budget, and that will stoke inflation. He makes notes on a pad. He will try to confirm whether the government has spent the bolivars.    First, though, Mr. Levy has a lunch at Member's, an elegant private club, with Jorge Redmond Schlageter, an outspoken, local agribusinessman.    &quot;Very tense,&quot; Mr. Redmond says of the relationship between the business community and the government. He says the business community has made concessions to the government and received nothing in return. And, he says, he is so worried about government policies that he has begun asking relatives and friends in other countries how to manage in an inflationary society.    &quot;He has a rounded view,&quot; Mr. Levy says of Mr. Redmond, adding that he &quot;seemed to be realistic, to have a judgment you can trust.&quot; The private sector, Mr. Levy concludes, falls into the pessimistic camp -- and that could be a serious impediment to economic growth.    As the unfavorable evidence builds, Mr. Levy says, &quot;The whole trip is an adjustment of my expectations.&quot;    Over dinner at a local steakhouse, Mr. Levy chats with Joseph Mann, an American reporter who writes for London's Financial Times. Mr. Levy often sees Mr. Mann. &quot;He plays a different role,&quot; Mr. Levy says. &quot;He gives me a feeling of what other people think in the market.&quot;    The two men chat about politics and the economy. &quot;I've never been worried about this country before,&quot; says Mr. Mann, who has been writing about Venezuela for 12 years.    Mr. Levy's second day begins at 8:30 a.m. at the central bank with a senior economist. It will be a chance to update what few statistics are available and to get a sense of how the economy is doing. In New York, Mr. Levy would have to wait three to four months for the data to arrive from the central bank. Telephones in Venezuela aren't reliable, and government officials are reluctant to give figures over the phone anyway.    One of his fears is confirmed; the economy slowed in the third quarter despite heavy government spending. The private business community is retrenching.    Mr. Levy knows Venezuela is rapidly losing reserves of dollars and other hard currency, but the economist tells him the drain is bigger than he expected. Moreover, the central banker tells him, some of those reserves are going to support the bolivar in foreign-exchange markets. Mr. Levy is startled. He had interpreted recent statements by a government official to mean that the central bank no longer could afford to intervene to shore up the currency. He concludes the situation is worse than he thought; the bolivar would be even weaker without the central-bank intervention.    Then the economist offhandedly says something that Mr. Levy interprets as being fraught with greater significance. Mr. Levy wants to know whether the government will pursue an austerity plan. The economist responds that &quot;a lot of political forces&quot; are at work on Venezuela's economic decision making. Mr. Levy knows what she means: The central bank thinks austerity should be the order of the day, but the politicians want to spend to fuel economic growth; severe austerity measures are unlikely.    &quot;Last time I was here,&quot; Mr. Levy says later, &quot;the political issue wasn't such an issue. It's a more important variable to take into consideration.&quot;    Still, many doubts remain in his mind. Although everybody seems pessimistic, there is disagreement on the specifics -- and the specifics are what Mr. Levy's clients want. Moreover, his confusion is furthered by a visit to MetroEconomica, a private consulting firm. MetroEconomica, he believes, has good sources in official circles and hasn't &quot;any ax to grind.&quot; He wants to compare notes.    Less than an hour before, the central banker had told Mr. Levy that non-oil exports were growing &quot;very, very slowly.&quot; MetroEconomica consultants tell him different: Their estimates show those exports will be up 24%. The conflict can't be resolved because official trade statistics are lacking. Mr. Levy won't include the situation in the next quarterly report unless he gets more information.    Such disparities in figures and interpretations make it difficult to draw conclusions, Mr. Levy says. &quot;I dread the minute I have to sit down -- and I'll have to -- to make up my mind on this.&quot;    He wonders whether things will get any clearer on his last day. It starts early. He arrives at 8 o'clock at the office of Robert Bottome, who publishes a newsletter on the Venezuelan economy. Mr. Bottome usually looks on the bright side, and Mr. Levy is looking for a countervailing opinion. &quot;Things are bad,&quot; Mr. Bottome says over a cup of coffee.    A barrage of new laws is hitting investors, Mr. Bottome says. Besides a new tax law that takes away benefits of the revised foreign-investment law, a planned labor law will prove costly to employers, and a banking law will divert credit from private business to the government.    Much of the rest of the day is spent discussing the status of the Venezuelan currency with various people. The exchange rate during his trip in November was around 25 bolivars to the dollar, and although it has since strengthened to about 21 to the dollar, there was a lot of speculation that it could fall to close to 50 to the dollar next year. Mr. Levy's forecast keeps shifting as he talks to different people -- each with his own idea on where the currency is heading.    So on his last day, at 5 p.m., Mr. Levy meets with another official of the central bank, and after a few minutes he gets around to his critical question: exchange-rate policy. The central banker begins to answer. Mr. Levy edges forward with his note pad. The telephone rings. &quot;This is like a Hitchcock movie,&quot; Mr. Levy says once the central banker is out of earshot. &quot;When the killer moves in for the kill, the phone rings.&quot;    His anticipation is, however, ill-founded. The central banker says he has no idea what the government will do. But, like Mr. Levy, he is looking for clues. A few days ago, the central banker relates, President Jaime Lusinchi said the government &quot;won't devalue the controlled market any more.&quot; The banker adds, &quot;That's a signal. It gives us an idea we'll stay a little longer with the exchange rate we have now.&quot;    It is Mr. Levy's turn to read between the lines. The central banker isn't denying or excluding a devaluation in the coming months. &quot;That leads me to believe the door is open&quot; for a devaluation, Mr. Levy says. (Venezuela has since created a third exchange rate for some transactions that amounts to a partial devaluation of the controlled rate.)    Mr. Levy walks down the steps of the central bank and out into the warm Caracas evening in search of a taxi. It was his last interview; he now heads home to digest all he has learned, and put it in a report.    He thinks he has accomplished most of what he set out to do. Venezuelans &quot;are living in a fool's paradise,&quot; he says, and the economy is heading for a fall.    Although he is comfortable with his basic conclusion, Mr. Levy knows that his report will contain much speculation and a lot of interpreting of vague signals. But he doesn't think he could have gotten a clearer picture, even if he had stayed another three days. &quot;Yet I have to make up my mind,&quot; he says. &quot;So when someone comes in 18 months later and says the bolivar is at 28 and you're off by a bolivar, I'm going to smack him in the face, the S.O.B., and say you go there and do it.&quot;    (Revised WSJ Jan. 8, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
