The incident illustrates the difficulties of monitoring armscontrol deals, an issue at the heart of debate over the treatysigned at the summit last December to eliminate medium-rangenuclear missiles.   The discussion will become even more heated as the two sidesdiscuss a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to slash longerrange arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.   Despite the unprecedented on-site inspection provisions of theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Force pact, to monitor it ``we are goingto rely about 95 percent on National Technical Means,'' orsatellites and listening stations, said former arms controlnegotiator John Rhinelander.   The task is complex, said the chairman of the SenateIntelligence Committee, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., because ``if youare going to hide a missile, you are very unlikely to hide it in asite where other side has the right of on-site inspection. You aregoing to put it somewhere else where it is concealed.''   On the question of test monitoring, a congressional scientificstudy said Thursday that seismic technology is sensitive enough toconfidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nucleartests.   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev areexpected to sign a pair of protocols designed to improve testmonitoring procedures.   The study by the Office of Technology Assessment, an arm ofCongress, said ``seismology now provides a means to monitorunderground nuclear explosions down to low yields, even whenstrenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems.''   But finding hidden missiles appears to be beyond thecapabilities of the two KH-11 photographic satellites the UnitedStates is thought to have in orbit now.   To fill the gap, Reagan on May 17 approved a compromise withBoren, who had been seeking billions of dollars in additional moneyover several years to boost the number and quality of U.S. spysatellites.   Soviet defectors, among them Alexei Myagov and Viktor Suvorov,have said the Soviets track U.S. intelligence satellites and try tofool them by covering up sensitive activities or by deploying dummyarmaments.   And the Kremlin has made similar allegations about the UnitedStates.   In the 1970s, the Soviets were irked to find that U.S.maintenance workers had covered Minutemen missile silos with tents,blocking them from satellite inspection in violation of armscontrol accords.   ``The U.S. side said it was raining. Probably it was flooding,because the tents stayed up for three months,'' said ValentinFalin, a non-voting member of the Soviet Communist Party CentralCommittee and frequent spokesman on U.S. relations.   Falin, interviewed recently in Washington, cited the tentincident as an example of the need for trust in verifying armscontrol accords.   Boren said the Soviets have ``little incentive to cheat'' on thepact eliminating their 707 medium-range missiles, which are kept atknown sites.   But, he said, ``when you get to START, where you are reducingdown by maybe 5,000 missiles, you have a much higher incentive tocheat'' because of the difficulty in many kinds of weapons spreadacross the Soviet Union.   ``Our means are not adequate to cope with that kind of demandwithout some substantial modernization and upgrading,'' Boren saidin an interview.   The amount of the spending increase and the exact hardwaresought by Boren is classified, but he says, ``I am not just talkingnumerically. I am talking qualitatively as well.''   One likely improvement would be radar-imaging satellites, ableto peer through clouds and darkness.   ``Remember our technical means are not just charged withverifying arms control agreements,'' Boren said. ``We also have tokeep up with what is going on in around the world. We have otherneeds,'' such as monitoring events in the Persian Gulf, keepingtrack of conventional forces in Europe and around the globe, andwatching weapons tests.   Former Intelligence Committee staff member Angelo Codevillaargues that America needs more and better satellites to providetargeting information on two new classes of Soviet mobile missiles,the SS-24 and SS-25.   ``What we have now is good for looking at places of knowninterest with means that are themselves known and that have verylimited areas coverage,'' said Codevilla, now at the HooverInstitute in California.   In the 20 minutes it would take an ICBM to fly from America toRussia, a mobile missile could be moved out of the intended blastarea.   The United States, said Codevilla, needs to monitor Sovietmissile sites around the clock to be able to change the course ofmissiles in flight.   William Arkin of the Institute for Policy Analysis inWashington, said that the overall product delivered by thesatellites ``is, in a nutshell, not very good.''   The exchange of information between U.S. and Soviet negotiatorshas produced far more information on Russian weapons systems thanintelligence collection, said Arkin.   For example, before the exchange of data in the INFnegotiations, said Arkin, the Pentagon estimated the number ofSS-20s at 441 and the number of SS-23s at 20. Soviet data providedlast December put the figures at 405 SS-20s and 102 SS-23s,including one battery never spotted by U.S. intelligence.</TEXT></DOC>
