The bank holding company said the Minnesota consolidation is the result of a new state law that permits banks in the Twin Cities area to consolidate existing offices. The law permits banks in other parts of the state to increase their branches to five from two, the company said. North Dakota's branch banking law allows bank holding companies to merge their existing facilities.    First Bank said the move was designed to increase convenience for its customers, giving them more branch locations from which to choose. </TEXT></DOC>
