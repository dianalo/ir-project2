The merger between Peoples, based here, and Manchester, N.H.-based United Savers is New Hampshire's first interstate transaction since it passed a law in April allowing banks to be acquired by out-of-state institutions.    The new holding company, United Heritage Financial Group Inc., will have assets of $2.5 billion and a market value of more than $300 million, based on current share prices.    Holders of United Savers, which owns both banks and thrifts, will receive 1.305 shares of the new holding company stock for each share. Peoples shareholders will swap shares on a one-for-one basis.    Preferred-share holders will receive preferred shares of the holding company that will be convertible to common stock on the same terms as issued by the original company.    Two months in the making, the transaction &quot;is part of a trend of mergers among equals,&quot; said Weston L. Bonney, Peoples president and chief executive officer. &quot;We operate under the same philosophies and both are in very strong economic areas.&quot; Mr. Bonney will be chairman of the new company until his retirement in September 1990. He will be succeeded by Daniel G. Edgar, chief executive of United Savers, who will be president of the new company until then.    Many investors have been buying New Hampshire bank stocks in the expectation that an out-of-state bank might acquire banks at a premium. Although there isn't any such premium in the proposed merger, Mr. Edgar said, &quot;We don't feel that the coming together of these two companies precludes a future sellout. In fact it makes the package more attractive.&quot;    After the announcement yesterday afternoon, United Savers shares dropped $2.25 to close at $22.50 and Peoples stock fell $1.375 to $17.75 in national over-the-counter trading.    John D. Rooney Jr., analyst with Moseley Securities Corp. in New York said, &quot;A lot of people were buying shares in New Hampshire banks in the hopes that a bigger bank would perhaps buy them out and their stocks value would go up. I'm not surprised when something like a merger of two equals occurs, some of those people want to unload their stocks.&quot;    Officials estimate it could take nine months before the transaction is cleared by regulators. The merger requires approval by stockholders, who are expected to vote on the proposal later this year.    The new company, which will have 56 offices throughout New Hampshire and Maine, expects to pay quarterly dividends at an initial rate of 14 cents a share.    Peoples has total assets of $1.5 billion; United Savers' assets total $1.03 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
