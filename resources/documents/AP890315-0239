Very strong thunderstorms, accompanied by some small hail, hitthe mountains of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina.Thunderstorms in Michigan triggered a fire in a church and pushedthe Rogue River to near flood stage at Rockford.   More than 16 inches of wet, heavy snow fell at the K.I. SawyerAir Force Base, shutting down routine operations at the LakeSuperior post in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.   However, the stormy weather was fairly short-lived.   ``This is a typical March storm,'' said meteorologist Fred Keyesof the National Weather Service bureau in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``Youhave all sorts of weather and then it moves out as quickly as itcame. It doesn't hang around like a real winter storm does.''   In the West, snow fell throughout much of the morning over partsof central Montana. Snow was occasionally heavy in the Great Fallsarea, with up to 2 inches of snow per hour at times.   Rain was scattered across the Pacific Northwest.
