The Labor Department said the steepest increase in food prices ina year combined with the largest rise in energy prices in two yearsto push up the Producer Price Index 1.0 percent last month.   Analysts said the rise in food prices partly was due toafter-effects of last summer's drought, while recent increases incrude oil prices have pushed up energy costs. But the report alsoshowed strong increases in a variety of other categories.   ``The report signals that the economy has launched into anothersignificant racheting upward of inflation,'' said economist AllenSinai of the Boston Co. ``There was no comfort in this inflationreport anywhere.''   It was the biggest increase since an identical surge in October1985. The index hasn't risen faster in a single month since April1981, when it shot up 1.1 percent.   The large gain surprised analysts, who were expecting a moderate0.3 percent to 0.4 percent increase.   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association ofWholesaler-Distributors, called the report ``very troublesome.''   With rising prices at the intermediate and crude levels likely totrickle down into further increases for finished goods, ``we've gotsome high numbers ahead of us,'' Van Dongen said.   Economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. InternationalInc. predicted in advance of the report that any increasesubstantially higher than 0.4 percent could roil financial markets.   In December, wholesale prices climbed at half the January rate _a still brisk 0.5 percent. That was revised up from an earlierestimate of 0.4 percent.   For all of 1988, the Producer Price Index rose 4.0 percent, thesteepest climb in seven years and nearly double the 2.2 percentincrease posted in 1987. Economists are looking for a slightlyfaster rate of increase this year.   Energy prices at the finished goods level, led by an 11.6 percentjump in home heating oil, climbed 4.9 percent last month. It was thelargest boost since energy cost rose 7.2 percent in January 1987.   Crude oil prices have climbed about $3 to more than $17 a barrelover the last several months, but many analysts had predicted thatunusually warm winter weather would hold any heating oil increasesin check.   Wholesale gasoline prices rose 4.1 percent last month afterfalling 3.1 percent in December. Natural gas increased 4.8 percentafter rising 3.3 percent a month earlier.   The price of food one stop short of the retail level climbed 1.1percent, the biggest jump since January 1988.   Egg prices alone soared 20.1 percent and pork prices jumped 11.4percent.   Goods other than food and energy collectively increased amoderate 0.4 percent. There were, however, some sharp increases inindividual catagories, including prescription and over-the-countermedicines, magazines, household electrical equipment, flatware, toysand games and automobiles.   The auto increase had been expected as car dealers phased outincentive programs.   The overall January increase left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 111.0, meaning a hypothetical selection of goodscosting $100 in 1982 would have cost $111 last month, $1 more thanin December.   Price indexes for goods at the intermediate level of productionand for crude goods show more inflation in the pipeline.   Intermediate goods rose 0.9 percent, the steepest monthlyincrease in nearly eight years, while crude goods shot up 3.9percent, the most since August 1980. Crude goods rose 3.4 percent inDecember, but those prices fell for three consecutive months priorto that.   The heated pace of inflation in the report was likely to raiseconcern at the Federal Reserve Board, which has been pushing upinterest rates in an effort to slow the economy and dampen inflation.   Last month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress that thecentral bank's policy would lean toward higher interest rates solong as labor markets remained tight and factory capacity wasstrained.   The unemployment rate of 5.4 percent last month is near a 14-yearlow, pushing wages up in some areas of the country. Use of factorycapacity is at a decade high.   January's higher wholesale numbers, the first inflation report ofPresident Bush's term, will likely be seen as disturbing news at theWhite House.   Administration policymakers are counting on lower inflation tohelp Bush hold the federal budget deficit down and keep his ``no newtaxes'' pledge.   The nation will get its first look at inflation on the consumerlevel, which includes imports and services, when the LaborDepartment releases it Consumer Price Index on Feb. 22.   David Wyss, an analyst with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,Mass., forecasting firm, warned that more food price increases maybe ahead, particularly for meat.   ``We had all that heavy slaughtering in the fall (after thedrought) and now, of course, we're running out of beef,'' he said.   Meanwhile, lack of rain east of the Rocky Mountains is shrivelingthe winter wheat crop.   ``It's no big deal yet ... but it's not an encouraging start tothe year,'' Wyss said.</TEXT></DOC>
