Completing work on the $291 billion defense authorizationbill for fiscal 1992, the committee included $4.6 billion forthe so-called Strategic Defense Initiative to guard againstaccidental Soviet or Third World missile launches. But in apreview of the bitter fight expected when the Senate takes upthe measure this month, committee members clashed openlyabout whether the SDI language calls for violating the 1972Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviets.</LP><TEXT>   The SDI funding is $600 million less than the White Houserequested, but nearly $2 billion more than the House approvedearlier this year for long-range missile defenses in thefiscal year starting Oct. 1.   More important, the committee for the first time shiftedits primary emphasis to creating a limited, ground-basedsystem that can protect parts of the U.S. as early as 1996.But the language, hammered out after days of partisanwrangling, left the door wide open to sharply differentinterpretations.   The package envisions establishing more than the singleanti-missile site allowed under the 1972 pact, but delays thedecision for at least several years and urges the presidentto try to renegotiate the pact in the meantime.   Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) said in an interview that thecommittee's action was &quot;truly misguided&quot; because it &quot;clearlyplaces in the SDI plan&quot; the goal of proceeding with multiplesites regardless of whether the treaty is amended. Sen. AlGore (D., Tenn.) another SDI critic, complained that thecommittee's vote will &quot;light a fuse leading to thedestruction of public confidence in the ABM treaty, if not tothe destruction of the treaty itself.&quot;   Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), on the other hand, said thecommittee adopted a two-pronged approach that calls fortreaty -- complying deployment in the short run and &quot;lays outa negotiating course for {making} modest changes&quot; to thetreaty after that.   President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney continueto push for a more ambitious and expensive system designed toprotect larger areas by using space-based interceptors dubbedBrilliant Pebbles.   Although it passed the committee by a 16-4 vote, portionsof the compromise SDI language appear designed to paper overrather than resolve fundamental questions about the future ofSDI. Republicans, for example, agreed to support the packagepartly because funding for Brilliant Pebbles was boosted tomore than $620 million. Nevertheless, the final bill is boundto reflect the fact that any space-based system is likely tobe too expensive, technically risky and politically unpopularto be deployed for the foreseeable future.</TEXT></DOC>
