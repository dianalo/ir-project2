The Cambodian resistance and most governments involved inefforts to end the war say it must be resolved with a singlepackage tackling all the major issues.   However, Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan,impatient with slow progress toward an agreement, has said thecombatants first could agree to a truce and internationalverification of a Vietnamese troop pullout.   He said they could then take on more vexing issues, such aspower-sharing.   Along with China, Thailand is the main backer of a guerrillacoalition fighting the government Vietnam installed in Cambodiawith an invasion 11 years ago.   ``The Cambodian issue must be solved, and in order to advancetoward a comprehensive solution ... we could and we should movestep by step to settle the problem,'' Radio Hanoi today quotedDeputy Premier Bhichai Rattakul as saying.   Bhichai spoke Thursday at a news conference at the end of athree-day official visit to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, with othersenior government officials and businessmen.

The new talks, co-chaired by France,represent an attempt to resume the dialogue after a month of failedinternational talks in Paris in August.
