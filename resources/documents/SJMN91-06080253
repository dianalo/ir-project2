Last week, in a story about a rumor sweeping the citythat King had died from his injuries, the Los Angeles Times quoted a60-year-old businessman as saying, &quot;I just thank dear God that it is not a hotAugust night.&quot;;    It's a dicey issue.;    On one hand, the fear &quot;sort of buysinto a lot of the myths that black folks are close to being animalisticanyway, and given the slightest provocation they'll pour out in the streetsthrowing rocks and bottles and things,&quot; said Joe Hicks, communicationsdirector for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.;   Hicks, who is black, grew up in Los Angeles' black community.;    At the sametime, Hicks said, such uprisings sometimes have been the only recourse theblack community has found available.;    &quot;People are angry,&quot; he said. &quot;But interms of speculating that this may be the spark for some kind of civil unrestor uprising on the part of minority communities, those are the kinds of thingsyou don't want to speculate on.&quot;;    Said Ralph Sutton, a spokesman for theBrotherhood Crusade, a black civic group: &quot;It's a very tense climate. I thinkthat if things are not handled in the proper way, the potential is a very realone.;    &quot;I don't think anyone thought that a traffic infraction would havecaused what it did in 1965,&quot; Sutton said, referring to the start of the Wattsriots -- on a hot August night.;    That night, police had been trying toarrest a Watts man on suspicion of drunken driving. There was a scuffle.Eventually, a watching crowd closed in on the fracas. By the time the violenceended days later, the government reported 34 people had died; 1,032 had beeninjured; 3,952 were arrested; and $200 million in property had been damaged ordestroyed.;    There was no angry crowd at King's beating by police after atraffic stop early the morning of March 3. But there was an amateurphotographer who captured its 56 blows and seven kicks by officers on tape.;   That tape since has been aired repeatedly on national television, stirring anational furor, federal investigations and growing calls for the resignationof controversial Police Chief Daryl Gates.;    &quot;People are more prone now thanin the '60s to wait and see whether justice will prevail in a case like this,&quot;Sutton said.;    If it does, he said, the case could lead to a greaterunderstanding of and respect for the minority community. &quot;We should be able togalvanize and pull together behind things other than a Persian Gulf war.&quot;;   City Hall is keeping a close watch on racial tensions in the wake of King'sbeating and of the shooting death last weekend of a 15-year-old black girl,allegedly shot by a Korean grocery owner.;    &quot;I don't believe there's aconcern that outright rioting will occur,&quot; said Vallee Bunting, a spokeswomanfor Mayor Tom Bradley. &quot;We are concerned there's increased tension, however.&quot;Bunting said the mayor's office is &quot;trying to alleviate divisiveness betweencommunities, and (to) stop the possibility that any racial conflict canoccur.&quot;;    But while people are tense and angry in the wake of the release ofpolice transmissions from the night of the beating, the ACLU's Hicks said, &quot;Wewould all rather see it take a positive political direction, have peoplechannel that to agitate for police reforms.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAMELA KRAMER, Mercury News Los Angeles Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  688  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080253,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
