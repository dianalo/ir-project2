The list, disclosed yesterday, represents the biggestone-time defection of companies from the Nasdaqover-the-counter market. But there's nary a household name,and not a lot of earnings either, among the companiesplanning to switch to the Amex's Emerging Company Marketplacestarting Wednesday.</LP><TEXT>   The defectors include such little-known names as TopSource Inc., Three Five Systems Inc., Printron Inc. andAmerican Pacific Mint Inc. Many of the companies, includingPrintron, are currently among the smallest and most fitfullytraded stocks; some are listed on Nasdaq's electronic &quot;OTCbulletin board.&quot; None is going public for the first time,though the Amex says it's talking with three such currentlyprivate companies.   The Amex promised the new arrivals what amounts to a freetrial offer. The Amex waived the $5,000-a-company fee to liston the emerging marketplace for companies that are part ofnext week's launch. Companies were also reminded that theycan keep a relationship with their Nasdaq dealers, so theycan theoretically return to Nasdaq later if they want.   None of Nasdaq's most prized OTC companies are on the newAmex roster. Indeed, Nasdaq officials asserted that theirmarketplace is unfazed by the defections. &quot;This emergingmarket appears to be a wheel that does not need to bereinvented,&quot; said a Nasdaq spokesman.   Still, the Amex has made good on its vow to swipe a numberof small companies for the new marketplace. Through a specialtask force, the Amex burned up the telephone lines to smallerNasdaq companies in recent months, and visited otherspersonally, trying to get them to switch.   &quot;We've talked to their analysts on the phone probably 100times,&quot; said Eleanor Schuler, chief executive officer ofPrintron, an Albuquerque, N.M., company, with no sales yet,that has developed a &quot;nonpolluting&quot; method of makingelectronic printed circuit boards. &quot;We liked their attitudeand their interest.&quot;   Printron, like some other companies, said it's the Amex'srecognition in Europe and Asia that convinced them to switch.In Asia, &quot;they can't even pronounce Nasdaq in some of thoseplaces,&quot; said Ms. Schuler.   In wooing the companies, the Amex argued they'd getgreater visibility and trading support in the new market thanon Nasdaq, which trades 4,100 stocks, compared with 1,055 onthe Amex. The argument centers on whether small stocks get abetter deal on a trading floor (at the Amex) or on acomputerized dealer system (Nasdaq).   Some of the Amex emerging companies don't even have salesyet. One that does is Three Five Systems of Phoenix, Ariz.,which makes light-emitting diodes for measuring and controlsystems; it had $18.7 million in sales last year and a stockprice of $2.25 bid. David R. Buchanan, chairman, said ThreeFive decided to join the Amex emerging market in order to beseen as a growth company. On Nasdaq, &quot;we were kind of slatedas an also-ran,&quot; Mr. Buchanan said. He also hopes hiscompany's stock price will &quot;stabilize&quot; now.   Also appealing to the companies is that some will belisted in newspapers for the first time. &quot;A great deal ofpublicity will be generated by it.&quot; On the new market, &quot;I'llbe a big fish in a little pond, so to speak,&quot; said StuartLandow, president of Top Source. The New York companylicenses technology such as overhead sound systems to carmakers; it had $1.5 million in sales last year. The stocktrades at $3.625.   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the newAmex marketplace last week. The market is meant to be anurturing ground for companies that otherwise wouldn'tqualify for an exchange listing (nor, in most cases, alisting on Nasdaq's National Market System for higher-qualityOTC companies). Even Amex officials concede that the kinds ofcompanies on its emerging marketplace represent some of theriskiest investments a small investor can make. But theofficials say the market will allow some good companies togrow and eventually qualify for full listing. The exchangesays the lower-standard companies will be clearly marked assuch, and their prices carried in separate tables in thenewspaper.
