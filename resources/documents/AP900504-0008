Everything going to the Lower 48 is domestic.   ``The amount of heroin seized here lately would indicate to meit's a transshipment point,'' he said.   Customs agents have intercepted several drug shipments atAnchorage International Airport in recent months, but believe theyhave staunched just a fraction of the incoming flow of narcotics.   The airport, which handles about 250,000 flights a year, is astrategic refueling stop for trans-polar flights between Europe andAsia.   Ninety-eight percent of all air cargo going eastward between thetwo continents stops at Anchorage, and 70 percent of cargo sentfrom the Lower 48 states to Asia passes through Alaska, says GinaMarie Lindsey, executive director of the Alaska InternationalAirport System.   Intelligence reports also indicate that marijuana from Thailand,opium from Pakistan and cocaine from South America are beingsmuggled in increasing quantities into the United States from Asian``mother ships'' that transfer their drug cargoes to smallervessels along Alaska's jagged, remote shoreline, state and federalagents say.   In October, two Nigerians were arrested at the airport forallegedly attempting to smuggle in one kilogram of nearly pureheroin. Max Kitchens, head of Customs' enforcement in Alaska, saidthat seizure is ``just one indication to us they're using Alaska asa transit point.''   Last month, Anchorage police found 45 balloons filled with 9ounces of heroin inside a toilet at a local jail and suspect it wasleft there by a Nigerian detained temporarily at the airport by theImmigration and Naturalization Service.   Apart from passengers who conceal drugs on their bodies or inluggage, cargo shipments are a prime method for smugglers,officials say. Most cargo aircraft passing through Anchorage areforeign carriers, and many are bound for Europe.   Last week, 12 pounds of opium from Thailand were found in aFederal Express shipment passing through the airport, Kitchenssaid. It was addressed to a church in Sacramento, Calif., anddiscovered during a routine cargo check, he says.   The last major offshore drug seizure was in 1984, whenauthorities found 12.5 tons of marijuana aboard the MV Allison, aseismological survey ship.   ``We keep getting intelligence that the same thing is goingon,'' Kitchens says. Reports indicate that freighters have beenbringing cocaine into the United States via Alaska, he said.   Federal and state officials say they cannot possibly keep guardon a coastline dotted with thousands of inlets and islands andstretching from the western Aleutians Islands to south ofKetchikan. That gives smugglers an advantage, Kitchens said.   ``They've got so much more resources,'' he said. ``They got moremoney than we do.''   Such routes are enticing to smugglers facing tightenedsurveillance along the Mexican border, said Lt. Tom Stearns,commander of the Alaska State Troopers' Bureau of Drug Enforcement.   His 23-member special drug squad was set up late last year tocoordinate drug enforcement efforts between state and federalagencies.   ``If you look on a map _ all the little coves and things _ it'sjust impossible to cover it,'' Kitchens said. ``There is so muchdistance and there are so few of us.''</TEXT></DOC>
