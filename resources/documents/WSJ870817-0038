But the carrier's decision to delay naming a supplier for about 10 long-range aircraft gives Airbus Industrie another chance at landing a contract that could be valued at $950 million.    In announcing its Boeing order Friday, British Airways also secured options on 15 additional 767-300s. The 767 twin-jets, which will seat 250 passengers each, will be delivered between November 1989 and February 1992.    They will be equipped with engines from Rolls-Royce Ltd. similar to those on 16 747-400s that British Airways ordered from Boeing last August for $2.3 billion. A Boeing spokeswoman said the engines could be interchanged. As previously reported, British Airways has options on 12 additional 747-400s.    While the airline's choice of the Boeing planes deprived Airbus of a contract for its A-300 jets, the delay in deciding on a replacement for its aging longer-range Lockheed Corp. Tristar jets gives the European consortium a renewed chance to sell its A340.    Earlier last week, British Airways had appeared ready to buy McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new MD-11 instead of the A-340. But Airbus Thursday made a &quot;very last-minute offer&quot; that brought the A-340 &quot;into the same ballpark as the MD-11,&quot; according to British Airways Chief Executive Sir Colin Marshall. Unlike McDonnell Douglas, however, Airbus wasn't able to provide detailed specifications about its new jet. &quot;The same information wasn't on the table from both companies,&quot; Sir Colin said.    By deferring a decision, British Airways gave Airbus, a government-supported consortium of French, West German, British and Spanish companies, time to muster details of its bid. British Airways Chairman Lord King said he expected &quot;fierce competition&quot; between McDonnell Douglas and Airbus over the order.    Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace industry analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York, attributed the 767 sale to Boeing's decision earlier this year to fit its 767 with engines made by Rolls-Royce, a state-owned British manufacturer. Previously, only American-made engines were available to power the twin-jet, he said.    &quot;This establishes the 767 as a premier wide-body and will help with other sales in Europe,&quot; Mr. Rubel added.    British Airways said it selected the 767 after &quot;a most careful study&quot; of the jetliner and the competing A-300. Officials of Airbus couldn't be reached for comment on the British Airways order.    Boeing, a commercial aircraft maker and defense contractor, said total orders for its 767 stand at 263. Orders for the 757 stand at 223. British Airways had ordered 31 of the 757s prior to its most recent order.    Separately, British Airways shareholders approved the board's plan to press the case for its proposed takeover of British Caledonian Group PLC &quot;as vigorously as possible.&quot; About 300 holders, voting by a show of hands, endorsed the plan. The proposed takeover is being delayed while Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission studies it for possible antitrust implications. The review is to be completed within three months.    Under its original bid, British Air offered #237 million ($377 million) for the other airline. But if the commission allows British Air to proceed, the carrier will have to resubmit its bid and could do so at a lower price.    A small London travel company, Travel Eye Ltd., said last Thursday that it made a #237 million offer for British Caledonian. But a spokesman for British Caledonian, who didn't want to be identified further, said: &quot;No offers have been received from anybody.&quot;    British Caledonian did receive a letter on Thursday from United Air Travel in which the company said it would like to put together a proposal to buy the airline, the spokesman said. He added that Investors in Industry, a group that holds 41% of British Caledonian, said it wouldn't consider any alternative offers until the monopolies commission completes its review of the British Air bid.
