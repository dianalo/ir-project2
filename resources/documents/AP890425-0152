The 1985 levels, the report said, were more than enough to pokea hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic, which appeared in thelate 1970s.   It is the chlorine in chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons thatbreaks down in the stratosphere, and destroys the earth's ozoneshield. Depletion of the ozone layer lets ultra-violet radiationfrom te sun get through, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eyedisease, while threatening plant life on land and in water.   The report was prepared by the U.S. Public Interest Researchgroup; the Institute for Energy and Environmental Studies; theNational Toxics Campaign, and the Clean Water Action Project. Thegroups said they would knock on doors in 40 states and mobilizelocal activist organizations to win support for an earlier phaseoutthan currently planned.   The U.S. government is part of the Montreal Protocol, the 1987treaty that requires industrial nations to cut production of CFC'sto 50 percent of 1986 levels by 1999.   The United States and the European Community have proposed goingfurther, calling for a ban on CFC production by the year 2000.   The report called for a 50 percent cutback of CFC's and relatedchemicals by 1991, and elimination of these chemicals _ plusanother ozone-depleter, carbon tetrachloride _ by 1995.   The groups also proposed 1995 elimination of methyl chloroform,which has similar destructive effects, with a five-year extensionif no safe alternative is available.   U.S. chemical companies are now testing CFC substitutes, butproduction is not expected for three-to-five years, according tothe industry.   U.S. delegates to an international meeting of Montreal Protocolsigners next week are expected to warn that unrestricted use ofnow-unregulated carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform couldoffset the phaseout of CFC's in the treaty.   Last week, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register thatthe upcoming meeting, in Helsinki, is likely to propose that thetwo chemicals be included in the protocol.   The new environmental report said, ``The Montreal Protocolagreement would allow stratospheric chlorine levels from humanemissions in the next 50 years to increase to a level four timeshigher than the level ... that existed'' before the Antarctic ozonehole was discovered.   ``Even under EPA's strongest set of measures, by (the year) 2100stratospheric chlorine levels from human emissions are projected toremain higher'' than the level that caused the ozone hole, thereport added.   ``In the long term, to allow atmospheric chlorine levelsanywhere near those which catalyzed the Antarctic hole is to courtdisaster,'' the report said.   CFC gases are used as computer solvents, refrigerants andfoam-blowing agents for insulation. Halons are used infire-fighting equipment. Carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroformare solvents used to clean machinery.</TEXT></DOC>
