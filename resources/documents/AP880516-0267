Going to sleep is a kind of ritual. For many people, adults aswell as babies, conditions must be just right. A grown-up's nightlyceremony might involve reading, watching the news or simply rollingonto one's stomach.   Babies have going-to-sleep routines, too.   ``Many children fall asleep on the floor in the living room withthe TV anand everybody milling around. They wake upin the crib in a dark room in another part of the house with itquiet,'' says Dr. Richard Ferber, who heads the Center forPediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital here.   Imagine whad the lights on t it would be like to wake up and discoveryourpillow gone. Would you just drift back to sleep?   Probably not, says Ferber. More likely, you would snap on thelight and look for it. And if you couldn't find it, you would be asangry, frustrated and confused as a squalling baby.   Eventually, everyone learns how to get back to sleep at nightwithout crying for help. However, Ferber says that for about aquarter of all parents, children's nighttime crying is a probly D.W.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson suspended hisRepublican presidential campaign today with a bow toward GeorgeBush's ``magnificent effort'' and said he would immediately returnto the helm of his financially-troubled religious broadcastingnetwork.   Two months after the Super Tuesday primaries ground to a haltRobertson's ``invisible army'' of fervent supporters, the formertelevision evangelist formally took himself out of the GOPpresidential race.   ``Today I suspend my candidacy for the Republican nomination in1988 but I do not now nor will I ever suspend my advocacy ofconservative and moral principles,'' Robertson said in front of hisGeorgian-style mansion here. ``George Bush has won the nomination.I applaud his magnificent effort and warmly endorse his candidacy.''   Robertson said he filed incorporation papers today for a newpolitical action committee called ``Americans for the Republic,'' agroup that he said would be ``a rallying point for future politicalaction.''   But when pressed about whether he would run again in 1992,Robertson said, ``That remains a moot question until the 1988election. I hope Mr. Bush is elected and then re-elected again in1992.''   Robertson was accompanied by his wife Dede, his son Tim and afew aides. There were no other supporters present as Robertson readhis statement for reporters, in stark comparison to the throngsthat greeted Robertson at campaign rallies early in the primaryseason.   Robertson also said he would return to the ChristianBroadcasting Network he founded two decades ago.   ``At the urging of the board of directors of CBN, I have agreedto resume the leadership of CBN tomorrow,'' he said.   He would not discuss further layoffs at the network.   At the outset of the 1988 presidential race, Robertson was awild card.   The Republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelicalfollowers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of ashowing he might make. Since many Robertson supporters were new tothe political process, his potential impact was difficult to gauge.   In the end, Robertson spent $22 million and gained only 46delegates to the Republican National Convention.   Robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsingBush, the Republican nominee-to-be, who already has a mathematicallock on the nomination.   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early on _ theFeb. 8 Iowa caucuses, where he beat out Bush for second place,behind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.   But in the next big battle _ the New Hampshire primary _Robertson finished behind not only Bush and Dole, but also behindNew York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.   Even then, Robertson gave every indication that he expected tomake a comeback in the South, with its March 8 mega-primary.   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he told his supporters after thedisappointing showing in New Hampshire, ``tomorrow I go into theSouth, and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard.''   His backyard proved an unfriendly place. In the Southernprimaries, he finished no better than second place _ in Texas _ andwas third in his home state of Virginia.   Robertson continued to do well in the caucus states, winning inHawaii, Nevada, Washington and Alaska, and doing well in Minnesotaand Alaska.   But by mid-March Robertson was no longer even competing instates with primaries. He concentrated his scaled-down campaign onthe caucuses, started talking about 1992, and about making his markat the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer.   ``I am the true conservative candidate and I will bring thatvoice to the convention,'' he said. Robertson said he hoped toshape the party's platform, bringing it in line with hisconservative views.   ``I want a platform like the 1984 platform _ for school prayer,against abortion, for family values,'' he said.   The Robertson campaign was not without its other-worldly moments.   On Easter Sunday, Robertson told a Denver congregation hispresidential bid was divinely inspired.   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _running for president,'' he said. And it wasn't over yet, he toldthe faithful.   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundationfor a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... butI am not going to quit ... that is his plan for me and for thisnation,'' Robertson said.   Other signposts on the Robertson campaign trail:   _He sued former Rep. Paul McCloskey for libel when McCloskeysaid Robertson used the influence of his father _ then a U.S.senator from Virginia _ to avoid combat in the Korean War. Aftersome messy preliminaries, Robertson dropped the suit because it wasto go to trial on Super Tuesday. He was ordered to pay court costs.   _He contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as aformer television evangelist, although that was how he becamefamous. He said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would bemore accurate.   _His claim, in a New Hampshire debate, that there were nuclearmissiles in Cuba aimed at this country. Robertson later said he hadno firsthand information, but insisted that ``nobody reallyknows.'' The contention was denied by the White House, the JointChiefs of Staff and others.   _His charges that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger``wanted to sterilize blacks, Jews, mental defectives, andfundamentalist Christians.'' Planned Parenthood officials dismissedthe allegation. Scholars who have studied Sanger's writings saidthere was no basis for the claim.   _Robertson's claim that the State Department chose to ignoreintelligence gathered by his Christian Broadcasting Network peoplein Beirut on the location of some American hostages. The former CBNbureau chief in Beirut later said he had no such information.   _And statements that one can get AIDS through casual contact,contradicting medical experts' findings on the subject. He alsoadvocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs intothe country.</TEXT></DOC>
