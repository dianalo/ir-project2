Last week, American Express Co. admitted that its representatives planted false stories about international banker Edmond J. Safra. The company publicly apologized and agreed to contribute $8 million to Mr. Safra's favorite charities.    Then, Wednesday, Home Shopping Network Inc. was hit with a $100 million defamation verdict for falsely claiming that GTE Corp. phone foul-ups had crippled Home Shopping's sales.    Corporate backbiting is nothing new, but paying for it is rare. What surprised lawyers about the past week's events was that the aggrieved went to the trouble of doing more than turning the other cheek. Not only that, the efforts paid off.    As much as they may want to, few companies are willing to sue for defamation. Criminal-fraud charges apparently have never been brought in such cases. Even in a civil case, the time and cost involved are only part of the problem; there's also the potential for embarrassing publicity.    But the American Express and Home Shopping situations are likely to stimulate new interest in fighting back against false claims and other assorted dirty tricks.    &quot;The result of the GTE verdict may energize more libel claims by corporations,&quot; says libel-law expert Floyd Abrams. &quot;My own view is that the $100 million verdict will not stand up. However, it exists for the moment at least and may lead to a change of attitude among companies about asserting libel claims.&quot;    Generally, defamation law applies to businesses just as it does to individuals. That means the company that sues must prove that its competitor made statements that were false and defamatory, that is, harmful to the company's reputation. In the case of well-known companies, which the law treats as public figures, there's the added burden of proving that the statements were made with knowledge that they were false or with subjective doubt about their truthfulness -- the so-called reckless-disregard standard.    The main difficulty in such suits, says Mr. Abrams, is in gathering the evidence and proving it in court. Identifying a rumor-monger and getting evidence of his exact words can be a difficult task. Few companies wish to spend the time, energy and resources to prove such a case if they can settle their dispute without going to court.    &quot;Unless you've got clear and documentary proof or substantiated oral comments, I would think it would be awfully hard to make a case stick,&quot; says Kirk O. Hanson, a professor of business ethics at Stanford University Graduate School of Business.    In addition, to prove that a rival company made a false claim, a plaintiff would probably be obligated to turn over company documents it would rather not disclose, particularly to a competitor. Few companies are willing to go that far.    &quot;When you sue somebody for libel, you give that person a soapbox,&quot; says Richard Asche, a New York City litigator. &quot;When a person is a defendant in a lawsuit, they can say anything they want with complete immunity. It's more negative publicity in the long run.&quot;    Libel litigation is complicated, as well, by questions of whether a damaging allegation will be classified as false, and thus potentially libelous. Much of what companies contend is defamation could pass as half-truths, statements that aren't legally actionable but damaging nontheless, Mr. Hanson says.    &quot;Someone might say that a particular company has shaky finances or its lead engineer is departing or that it lost an important contract,&quot; says Mr. Hanson. &quot;That is all too frequently a competitive weapon.&quot;    Moreover, fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image. The &quot;macho mentality&quot; of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look &quot;whiny,&quot; says Mr. Hanson. Most companies, he says, &quot;are afraid to look as if they can't take the competition.&quot;    Occasionally, however, some companies have no choice but to go to court -- or to threaten such action -- to put a stop to false rumor campaigns and advertising tactics initiated by a competitor.    One of the most egregious examples of malicious gossip in recent years involved rumors in 1987 that Corona Extra beer was contaminated with urine. Faced with declining sales because of the rumor, the beer's importer, Barton Beers Ltd. of Chicago, filed a defamation lawsuit against a Reno, Nev., wholesaler, Luce andamp; Son Inc. The rival company carried Heineken -- then the nation's No. 1 import -- but not Corona.    The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Reno, alleged that Luce andamp; Son's salesmen were telling customers that Corona was brewed from &quot;impure&quot; and &quot;contaminated&quot; water; it asked for $3 million in damages.    But the alleged damages weren't as important to Barton as putting a stop to the rumors. The suit was dropped a month and a half after it was filed, after Luce andamp; Son agreed to state publicly that Corona was free of contaminants.    &quot;What we learned from all that was that the longer it's in the public eye, the more people heard about it and began to take it as reality,&quot; says Michael J. Mazzoni, general manager and executive vice president of Barton Beers. &quot;We felt that if we pushed it, it would keep it in the public eye and make it reality.&quot;    In GTE's case, it was in a stronger position to use the court to fight statements against it -- in part because Home Shopping had brought GTE into the courtroom in the first place. Also, GTE had the advantage of not having to prove who was spreading the allegations against it; Home Shopping was making its statements publicly and in court.    Originally, Home Shopping had sued GTE for $1.5 billion in damages for allegedly providing a grossly inadequate phone system for the Home Shopping operation. GTE filed a counterclaim alleging that Home Shopping's suit was a sham designed to pass the buck for Home Shopping's own troubles. The jury sided with GTE and returned a $100 million verdict. Home Shopping has said it would appeal.    Then there was the case of Mr. Safra, the international banker who won last week's settlement with American Express. Mr. Safra, who lives in Geneva and controls New York's Republic National Bank, contended that representatives of American Express planted false stories in several European newspapers last year that linked him to drug money laundering.    Through his attorney, New York criminal lawyer Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Safra traced the source of the smear campaign to representatives of American Express, thus clearing one major evidentiary hurdle in such cases. He then complained to company officials. American Express listened to the complaints but rejected them as unfounded.    Even so, Mr. Safra didn't file a lawsuit. Instead, Mr. Arkin, in his regular column in the New York Law Journal, described a hypothetical case similar to Mr. Safra's and suggested that such conduct could lead to criminal fraud charges. American Express quickly reconsidered and opted to settle with Mr. Safra.    Yesterday, American Express made public a letter in which a top corporate executive accepted responsibility for the campaign against Mr. Safra. Harry L. Freeman, the concern's executive vice president of corporate affairs and communications, said he will retire from the company no later than the end of the year.    Fraud charges are commonly brought against companies that make false claims about their own products. When coupled with an intent to cheat or deceive, false bad claims about a competitor could constitute fraud, Mr. Arkin argued in his law journal article. The First Amendment provides no protection against such charges, he added, because the constitution doesn't protect untrue statements.    &quot;There is no doubt that there is some type of conduct involving the deliberate release of false information that may not just be libelous but may also be fraudulent,&quot; agrees Mr. Abrams, the libel attorney. But because so few suits are filed over competitive tactics -- and almost none ever decided in court -- the hazy line between what's fair and what's illegal can be hard to pin down.    &quot;The line is not easy to define,&quot; says Mr. Hanson. &quot;But it comes when an organization becomes more concerned with destroying a competing business than in demonstrating that its own goods and services are superior.&quot;    He adds, &quot;When the sole purpose of a marketing strategy is the defeat of a certain company, then the company has gone across a line that probably will lead into questionable behavior.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
