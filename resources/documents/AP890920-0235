In recent years, Japanese banks have made significant inroads inthe U.S. market by adding and expanding their own branch officeshere, or buying into established financial units, from banking tosecurities operations.   In California, for example, Japanese-owned banks reportedlyaccount for nearly 20 percent of the banking business. And in NewYork, eight of the 10 largest foreign bank branches are part ofJapanese banks.   Japanese institutions make about 5 percent of all U.S. loans andhold about 9 percent of U.S. banking assets, according to Kakutani'sestimates. He and some other experts predict those figures willclimb steadily in the next 18 months as Japanese banks try tomaintain a competitive edge with each other. But Dai-Ichi, theworld's largest bank with assets of $414 billion, made the biggestcommitment in U.S. banking thus far when it agreed to acquire a 4.9percent stake in Manufacturers Hanover and a 60 percent interest inCIT Group, the bank's financial services unit, for about $1.4billion.   The deal, announced by both banks Monday and subject toregulatory approval, was part of a sweeping recapitalization plan bycash-hungry Manufacturers Hanover, the seventh-largest U.S. bankwith $70 billion in assets. That plan includes a $950 millionaddition to loan-loss reserves to cover shaky Third World debt andthe issuance of as much as $500 million in new common stock byyear's end.   Because Manufacturers will retain a minority stake in CIT andcurrent management will remain intact under the deal, Dai-Ichi willbe receiving the American know-how it needs for expansion whilesaving money in the long run, some analysts said.   Leasing and lending to medium-sized U.S. companies, which isCIT's primary business, are areas Japanese companies have been eagerto enter because they are among the most profitable parts of theU.S. financial market.   Profits are larger in the middle market because such companieshave less access to the stock and bond markets than the largercorporations, and therefore, less say in negotiating loan terms,said Richard A. Mueller, an analyst with Duff andamp; Phelps Inc. inChicago.   At the same time, James J. McDermott Jr., of Keefe Bruyette andamp;Woods in New York, said startup efforts in those areas are costlyand time consuming.   And Yuko Oana, Dai-Ichi's senior managing director, conceded,``We lack the technology ... and local expertise.''   He said CIT ``will enable us to offer a considerably broaderproduct line to our customers around the world ... (and) at the sametime, we believe that CIT will benefit from the internationalexposure and prespective that DKB can provide.''   Other Japanese banks have made similar deals.   As the Dai-Ichi-Manufacturers Hanover announcement was being madeMonday, Daiwa Bank Ltd. said it agreed to acquire the U.S.commercial banking operations of Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC for about$200 million. Earlier this summer, Mitsui Bank Ltd. agreed to pay$100 million for a 5 percent stake in a Security Pacific Corp.finance unit that includes leasing, commercial and consumer finance.   In 1984, Fuji Bank paid $425 million for control of HellerInternational Corp., a commercial finance company like CIT.   Even Japanese companies outside of banking have gotten into theact. In August, Orix Corp., a major Japanese leasing company, agreedto pay $190 million for a capital equipment financing subsidiaryowned by First Interstate Bancorp.   In addition, a number of big Japanese banks control primarydealers in U.S. government securities.   U.S. financial institutions, on the other hand, have been slowerto expand in Japan, primarily because access to Japanese marketshasn't been as open as access for Japanese firms to U.S. markets.</TEXT></DOC>
