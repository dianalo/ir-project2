The group includes Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine,Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.   Diplomats said the agreement, which was signed inIstanbul, illustrated how much the region has changed afterdecades of Cold War standoff, when Turkey was valued for itsstrategic deterrence against the now-defunct Soviet Union andWarsaw Pact.   The signatories embraced the project as a path tointegration with the world economy and a way of regulatingregional dislocations and conflicts. The declaration makescommitments to European accords on security, the environment,human rights and free enterprise. The formal document withthe group's aims is to be signed in June or July.                                                                                                          POLAND'S PRIVATIZATION REVENUE                                                                                                          Sales of state-owned firms in Poland are to produce about10 trillion zlotys ($870 million) in government revenue thisyear, according to a draft budget for the privatizationagency. The figures exclude any sales from sectors thatrequire political approval, such as defense, auto andaircraft manufacturing, tobacco and pharmaceuticals. Warsaw'ssell-offs last year raised 3 trillion zlotys, far less thanthe 15 trillion zlotys that the government had forecast.                                                                                                          SUDAN FREES ITS CURRENCY                                                                                                          Sudan has floated its currency and will lift somesubsidies on food and gasoline as part of its falteringefforts to reform the economy, anemic because of civil-warcosts and $13 billion in foreign debt. Khartoum raisedminimum pay 60% to help offset rising living costs, thoughprices are expected to double. Banks fixed the Sudanesepound's market price at 90 to the dollar on the first day offree trading. The devaluation is the 19th since the 1970s andthe third since Lt. Gen. Umar Hasan al-Bashir seized power ina 1989 military coup.                                                                                                          IRAN SEEKS TO REVIVE INDUSTRY                                                                                                          Iran said completing 20 dams as planned by March 1993would significantly boost electric power needed to rebuildthe country's limping industrial sector. All of Iran's powerstations were bombed in the war with Iraq but only some havebeen repaired and blackouts continue. Tehran, which hassigned contracts with foreign firms to increase powerproduction and is expected to offer more, must at leastdouble its output by 1998 to meet industrial demand. Almostall the power plants to be built after 1994 are to serveindustry.                                                                                                          U.S. INVESTS IN SINGAPORE                                                                                                          The U.S. remained the largest investor in Singapore'smanufacturing industry last year, committing 969 millionSingapore dollars (US$591.6 million), or 33% of the $1.79billion total, up 18% from 1990. Much of the money wasinvested to set up, expand or diversify the electronic partsand systems and chemical industries. Japan was thesecond-largest manufacturing investor, with S$713.2 million,or 24%, followed by the European Community with S$644million.                                                                                                          STRESS TAKES TOLL ON JAPANESE                                                                                                          Amid criticism of U.S. workers by top Japanese officials,a survey by the prime minister's office found thatmaintaining the country's high economic growth rate isexacting a heavy toll on a majority of Japanese workers'mental and physical health. Of the 2,310 men and women atleast 20 years old polled last October, 53% often feltemotionally stressed or fatigued, and 63% complained theywere chronically tired. In the health and welfare survey,conducted every three years, 26% said they were very healthy,down sharply from 48% in 1979; 60% rated their health asrelatively good, and 14% as poor.                                                                                                          EUROPEAN COMPROMISES SOUGHT                                                                                                          The European Community promised to seek compromises withthe European Free Trade Association to avert the collapse ofa landmark 19-nation single-market accord, which takes effectnext Jan. 1.   The stakes are high: The accord would create a vast marketfrom the Arctic Sea to the Mediterranean where people, goodsand services would move freely among the 12 EC countries andthe EFTA states: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland,Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein.   Though the accord was announced last October, the EC Courtof Justice forced reopening of negotiations. The pact wouldcreate a mixed EC-EFTA court to interpret single-market law,but the EC's highest court argued it should have solejurisdiction; the EFTA states disagree.   Companies in the EFTA nations desperately want to be partof the EC market. But the EC doesn't want the EFTA countriesto follow Austria and Sweden in seeking EC membership, asthey have threatened to do if the accord falls apart.

The U.S. opened embassies in the capitals of the formerSoviet states of Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,bringing to six the total of Washington's outposts in the11-member Commonwealth of Independent States. America alreadyhad embassies in Russia and Ukraine. . . . The EuropeanCommunity has signed a trade and economic agreement withLithuania, the first between the trade bloc and the Balticrepublic since it became independent in August.</TEXT></DOC>
