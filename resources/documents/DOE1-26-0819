If not, can a better match be made betweenoriginating station and port to curtail costs and ease congestion? Whatcapital improvements are needed to the rail system to meet the projecteddemand? A 1984 report of the Economic Development Council of NortheasternPennsylvania entitled Rail Routes for Export Anthracite answers all threeof these questions with an intensive analysis of the anthracite reservelocations and rail facilities which connect them to the Atlantic, Gulf,and Great Lakes ports. This paper summarizes some of the findings ofthat report. The report inventories the anthracite reserves and culmand silt banks in Northeastern Pennsylvania and locates them on specificline segments of the rail system. The report forecasts the worldwidedemand for anthracite from 1985 to 2050 by U.S. custom district to determinegeneral areas of departure. Furthermore, it determines the cheapest routesto ports within custom districts, and assigns traffic based on demandforecast and rail routes.</TEXT></DOC>
