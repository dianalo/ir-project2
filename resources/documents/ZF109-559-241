The instructor for this mini-seminar was ChrisPickering, President of System Development, Inc. (a CASE consulting firm) andof International CASE Users Group.andM;&quot;CASE is staying a hot topic.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: That's true!andP;  When we covered a CASE conference (CAN 224) and aCASE seminar (CAN 234), we concluded that CASE has some terrific conceptsthat promised much, but the products delivered little.andP;  Because of thecontinued interest in CASE, and rumors of greatly improved products, wewelcomed this opportunity to learn of new developments/improvements.andM;&quot;CASE is targeted at the professional systems developer.&quot;andP;  The goal is tobuild systems that meet business needs.andM;&quot;CASE is not mature.&quot;andP;  But, CASE is over five years old and &quot;we do know howto achieve a CASE environment.&quot;andM;&quot;Ultimately, CASE will be &quot;complete, integrated, and will provide virtualreality and intelligent support.&quot;andP;  But...andP;  &quot;Nothing available now supportsall of that.&quot;andM;In the past, &quot;CASE was divided into front-end and back-end products.andP;  Now,vendors are trying to provide a more integrated environment.&quot;andP;  &quot;We are movinginto a more sophisticated environment.&quot;andP;  But...andP;  &quot;We aren't there yet.&quot;andM;&quot;Today, CASE is used as an enforcement tool for structured methods.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: To me, that is its greatest -- perhaps only -- current strength.andO;That alone may be sufficient to warrant further investigation.andM;&quot;Today's products are much more capable of providing diagram-to-code[support].&quot;andP;  New products are becoming available every day.andM;He claims other new products improve CASE's &quot;data re-engineering&quot;capabilities -- &quot;especially in the IBM world.andP;  There, they are a reality.&quot;andM;He made the following claims for today's CASE products:andM;* They define the process.andM;* They reduce the need for technical expertise.andM;* They support development teams.andM;* They allow &quot;users as developers.&quot;andM;* They provide templates, thus sharing knowledge.andM;-for specific industriesandM;- users can modify generalized templatesandM;- for some CASE products, templates are available from third party vendorsandM;The speaker asked the audience how many were using CASE.andP;  About 1/3 raisedtheir hands.andP;  He said Computer World had conducted a survey which showedthat: only 10% of all computer &quot;shops&quot; are using CASE.andP;  Of those, it is usedin only 20% of their projects.andP;  And...andP;  of those, 50% are successful.andP;  (Hepresented those statistics as if they were proof of success.andP;  To me, theywere proof of failure!)andM;He had some more Computer World statistics with which he tried to impress us.andO;Of those actually using CASE:andM;* 87% thought the benefits were worth the investment.andM;* 47% are using CASE for new development.andM;* 13.6% are using it for maintenance.andM;CAN COMMENT: The first figure is impressive -- but difficult to correlatewith the 50% failure rate.andP;  The next two figures make me wonder.andP;  What arethe rest using CASE for?andM;More Computer World statistics:andM;* 37.1% credited CASE with improving quality.andM;* 23.2% said there was &quot;better communication.&quot;andM;* 12.4% acknowledged improved productivity.andM;* 8.2% credited it with improved development.andM;CAN COMMENT: Again, these statistics were presented as accomplishment.andO;Consider the reciprocals: from 62.9% who did not credit CASE with improvedquality to 91.8% who did not credit it with improved development.andP;  Preciselywhat do these statistics show?andM;He acknowledged that there are still &quot;major weaknesses.&quot;andP;  &quot;Especially inintegration and group support.&quot;andM;&quot;CASE is not all it can be.&quot;andP;  (Now there is a monumental understatement!)andM;&quot;Few shops use advanced technology.&quot;andP;  (Define &quot;advanced technology.&quot;)andM;&quot;CASE is a repository product.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: Hold it!andP;  He already reminded us that CASE has been around forfive years.andP;  How old is the concept of &quot;repository?&quot;andP;  Then ...andM;&quot;CASE on a project basis is a cost item.andP;  You only get cost justification onintegrated systems.&quot;andM;He estimated that it costs $11,000,000 to implement CASE for a 100 personshop.andP;  &quot;You can get a $22,000,000 savings if it is completely integrated.&quot;andM;Members of the audience offered their opinions:andM;* &quot;The tools are too costly -- it's too hard to learn!&quot;andM;* &quot;We are getting four-times productivity gains!andP;  It is not costly!&quot;andM;The instructor continued: &quot;CASE will enable us to do systems in ways thatwere not possible before.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Pickering presented his vision of the future of CASE:andM;* ubiquitousandM;- &quot;I don't think it is going to go away.&quot;andM;- &quot;All the major vendors have announced CASE strategies.&quot;andM;* paradigm shiftandM;- &quot;We are using the same methods we used for 20 or 30 years.&quot;andM;- &quot;Coding is going to go away!andP;  It is coming -- we just can't do it yet.&quot;andM;He sees some future needs:andM;* focus on processandM;- improve the process, not just the productandM;* improve integration (!)andM;* reduce concentration on code generationandM;- He conceded that some human coding will still be requiredandM;* standards are a necessity (!)andM;He predicted there will be less reliance on professional developers and moreon &quot;a team of users.&quot;andP;  (But he already said &quot;CASE is for professionaldevelopers.&quot;andP;  So?andP;  If there is less reliance on them, why do we need CASE?andO;Poor argument!&quot;)andM;In summary, he said, &quot;CASE is in its adolescence.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: I will easily concede there are improved CASE products.andP;  Sincethe early ones were so bad, almost any change would be an improvement.andP;  Itwould be easy to dismiss the whole concept -- except -- some people, likethat one member of the audience, have experienced considerable benefit fromthese tools.andP;  Perhaps it is like going into a swimming pool in the earlySpring: if you put one toe in, it is unpleasantly cold and you stop.andP;  But, ifyou dive right in, it is invigorating and you enjoy it.andP;  Anybody out thereready to dive in?andP;  For $11,000,000?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
