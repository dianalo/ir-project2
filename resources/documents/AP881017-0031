The move, made public following a meeting of the council's oilministers Sunday, appeared to defer to neighboring Iraq in givingit the same quota as Iran.   Emerging from their 8-year-old conflict, both Iran and Iraq havesaid they will need to pump as much oil as they deem necessary tofinance post-war reconstruction projects.   The council set one basic condition for the higher ceiling:adherence by all OPEC members to any production levels agreed upon.They also called for cooperation by oil producers outside thecartel.   The ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman andthe United Arab Emirates called the meeting to try to forge a jointstrategy to help OPEC prop up oil prices, deteriorating due to amarket glut.   The press statement, carried by the official Saudi press agency,said the council members ``affirmed their quest to stabilize theworld oil market on condition that this be the position of theother oil producers inside and outside OPEC.''   It said the council states were ready to follow an overallproduction ceiling of 17.429 million barrels per day for the 13members ``or any higher ceiling upon which agreement is reachedwithin the organization.''   The 17.429 million barrel figure seemed to give Iraq parity withIran's quota of 2.36 million barrels per day. The current ceilingfor the 12 nations without Iraq is 15.06 million barrels per day.   Iraq's quota under the 1986 agreement was 1.54 million barrels.The statement did not clearly state that Iraq was getting a higherquota and no one could be reached for clarification.   The statement also said any quota increase would be distributedin the same ratios as the current quotas.   Members have been pumping at least 3 million barrels per dayover the agreed on production ceiling. The call to increase theceiling appeared aimed at gaining some control over the market,even if falling short of the $18-per- barrel price that the currentceiling was supposed to bring. Oil was trading at around $8 belowthat mark in recent weeks.   Baghdad has ignored its limit and is producing at the rate of2.7 million barrels per day. Iran tried to produce above its quotabut damage to its facilities during the war kept it pumping at itsassigned level.   Iraq has suggested it will cooperate with OPEC. Iran'sparliamentary speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that therewas ``no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coastof the gulf'' over the oil market.   The United Arab Emirates also publicly renounced its quota,producing 1.5 million barrels daily as opposed to the 948,000barrels sanctioned by OPEC.   Saudi Arabia announced it would no longer cut production andsacrifice its revenue to defend prices. It has overshot its quotaof 4.3 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure theoverproducers into respecting the quota system.   Four of the six council members _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatarand the United Arab Emirates _ are ranking members of the 13-nationOPEC. The two others, Oman and Bahrain, are not OPEC members buttheir economies depend on oil export revenues.</TEXT></DOC>
