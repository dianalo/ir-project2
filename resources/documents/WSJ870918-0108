ApcarStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FBTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><TEXT>   First City Bancorp. of Texas's troubled banks, which are the target of a federal rescue, have apparently had to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas because of an unexpected shortage of funds.    The Houston-based banking company didn't have any comment on its borrowings. However, an official familiar with the banking company's operations said it is experiencing &quot;an aberration with funding sources&quot; that provide large sums of money to the bank company. The official said the borrowings reflect &quot;extraneous&quot; problems and don't indicate any broad liquidity difficulties. The official predicted that the borrowings would soon end.    According to reports by the Federal Reserve Board, total borrowings at the discount window at the Dallas bank were $509 million on Sept. 9, the day the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced its nearly $1.5 billion plan to recapitalize the failing banking company. The Fed report doesn't identify what institutions are borrowing. However, officials close to First City confirmed that the majority of the borrowings were by some of First City's banks.    As of last Wednesday, First City's money needs had apparently eased. The Dallas Fed reported total loans were $202 million. Officials again confirmed that the bulk of that was First City borrowings.    Banks borrow from the Fed's discount window when there are large, unforeseen deposit withdrawals, periods of tight credit or when other, more conventional sources of funds aren't readily available to the bank. Usually, a bank tries to make the borrowing in private to avoid sending signals that it has liquidity problems.    It has been at least a year or longer since First City has had to turn to the discount window for funds. In the past, its officers, when asked, would proudly note that its banks had managed to successfully handle their funding and liquidity needs despite their mounting problems.    As previously reported, the FDIC agreed to inject a $970 million note as part of the nearly $1.5 billion plan to bail out the bank, which has sustained heavy losses from real estate and energy loans. A. Robert Abboud, the former Chicago banker, also agreed to raise at least $500 million to recapitalize First City, which he will serve as chairman and chief executive officer after the plan is completed by year end. </TEXT></DOC>
