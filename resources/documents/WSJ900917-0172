Nonetheless, in national over-the-counter tradingFriday, Adobe tumbled $1.25 to $26.875 on volume of more than1.3 million shares.   The results included a special $3 million royalty paymentfrom a major customer, without which Adobe earnings wouldhave been a nickel a share or so lower, analysts estimated.   Bruce Lupatkin, a technology analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quistin San Francisco, said some investors may be concerned thatAdobe is experiencing &quot;margin pressures.&quot; He added: &quot;I thinkthose fears are misplaced. But that is the nature of themarket&quot; for technology stocks, which have been hammeredroutinely in recent months at any hint of weakeningoperations.   For the fiscal nine months, Adobe said earnings rose 18%to $28 million, or $1.28 a share, from $23.7 million, or$1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 38% to$115.4 million from $83.7 million.   Adobe said Apple Computer Inc., its largest customer,accounted for 21% of total revenue in the latest thirdquarter.
