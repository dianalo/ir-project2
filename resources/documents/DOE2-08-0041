For the measurement of quantitative relations,the yields of dicentric chromosomes, acentric fragments, and centricring chromosomes were recorded. All three patients received large-body-sectionirradiation with an accumulated target dose of 44.6 Gy, delivered in22 fractions of 1.8 Gy each. During treatment, blood samples were takenbefore and after each dose to measure the level of lymphocyte culture.The ratio of dicentric chromosomes to acentric fragments was 37:14. Theamount and morphology of radiation-induced chromosomal abnormalitiesdepend on different parameters, such as the size of the radiation field,localization, the fractionation schedule, and the total dose.</TEXT></DOC>
