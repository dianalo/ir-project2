In July 1979, the NRC issued NUREG-0578, ``TMI-2 Lessons LearnedTask Force Status Report and Short-Term Recommendations,'' \1\<NOTE/> which contained specific recommendations for a shift technicaladvisor (STA) to provide engineering and accident assessment expertiseduring other than normal operating conditions. On October 30, 1979, theNRC notified all operating nuclear power plant licensees that STAs shouldbe on shift by January 1980, and that they should be fully trained by January1981. In November 1980, NUREG-0737, ``Clarification of TMI Action PlanRequirements,'' provided further details to licensees regarding implementationof the STA requirement. It identified the STA as a temporary measure pendinga Commission decision regarding long range upgrading of reactor operatorand senior operator capabilities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Copies of all NUREGs referenced may be purchased throughthe U.S. Government Printing Office by calling (202) 275-2060 or by writingto the U.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC20013-7082. Copies may also be purchased from the National Technical InformationService, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,VA 22161. A copy is available for inspection or copying for a fee in theNRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, Lower Level, NW., Washington,DC.The qualifications of operators were also addressed in 1979 by NUREG-0585,``Lessons Learned Task Force''; in the 1980 Rogovin Report, ``Three MIleIsland: A Report to the Commissioners and to the Public'', (NUREG/CR-1240);and in SECY-82-162, ``Report of the Peer Advisory Panel and the NuclearRegulatory Commission on Operator Qualifications'',\2\<NOTE/>. Although the 1982 Peer Advisory Panel report recommendedagainst imposition of a degree requirement, the consensus among these reportswas that technical and academic knowledge among shift operating personnelgreater than existed at that time would be beneficial to the safety ofnuclear power plants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The documents with SECY designators are available at theNRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, Lower Level, NW., Washington,DC. On October 28, 1985, the NRC published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 43621) a Final Policy Statement on EngineeringExpertise on Shift, which described two alternatives for providing thenecessary technical and academic knowledge to the shift crew. Option 1of the policy statement permits an individual to serve in the combinedsenior operator/shift technical advisor (SO/STA) role if that individualholds either a bachelor's degree in engineering technology, or physicalscience from an accredited institution, or a professional engineer's license.Option 2 permits continuation of the separate STA, on each shift, who holdsa bachelor's degree or equivalent, and meets the criteria as stated inNUREG-0737. The Commission also encouraged the shift supervisor to servein the dual-role position and the STA to take an active role in shift activities.On May 30, 1986, the NRC published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPR) (51 FR 19561). The purpose of the ANPR was to solicit public commentson a Commission proposal to extend the current level of engineering expertiseon shift and to ensure that senior operators have operating experienceon a commercial nuclear reactor operating at greater than twenty percentpower. Two hundred letters were received in response to the ANPR; mostof them were opposed to a degree requirement for Senior Operators. Although comments received on the ANPR were generally opposed to a degreerequirement, the Commission believed that it would be beneficial to obtainadditional public comment on two alternative proposals. On December 29,1988, (53 FR 52716) the Commission published a proposed rule for degreerequirements for shift personnel, with two alternate approaches_additionaleducation and experience requirements for either senior operators or shiftsupervisors.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The term ``shift supervisor'' is being used to refer tothat person holding a senior operator license for all fueled units at thesite who is assigned responsibility for overall plant operation at alltimes there is fuel in any unit. Where a single senior operator does nothold a senior operator license on all fueled units at the site, a licenseemust have at the site two or one more senior operators, who in combinationare licensed as senior operators on all fueled units. The Commission recognizesthat persons may have a different title than ``shift supervisor'' at differentutilities. Approximately 95% of the comment letters received are opposed to any rule.As described elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Commission has decided to terminate therulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Development of Final Policy Statement </ITAG>In deciding not to proceed with the rulemaking, the Commission carefullyconsidered the comments received on the proposed rule and the status ofindustry initiatives to enhance the education level of its operating personnel.In particular, the Commission noted that many utilies have provided opportunitiesfor members of their operating staff to further their education. Whereprograms are in place, they have included: 1. Financial assistance for taking college courses off-site; 2. Development of programs, in conjunction with universities and colleges,that provide college level courses and degrees_including arrangements thatprovide appropriate credit for nuclear power plant training courses andwork experience; and 3. On-site programs that provide college level courses and degrees formembers of the operating staff. The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), in cooperation with manynuclear utilities, has developed ``Principles for Enhancing Professionalismof Nuclear Personnel'', dated March 1, 1989. INPO encourages utilitiesto implement these principles. Among other important matters, these principlesdirectly address developing management personnel and managing operationsdepartment personnel. In particular, they encourage that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Management development and selection practices reflect the fact thatwork in plant operation provides the broad, integrated view of plant activitiesneeded by nuclear managers. Individuals with experience in day-to-day plantoperations are considered as an important source of management talent.The policies and practices that govern career development ensure that individualsare aware of the opportunity to develop into management positions and thatselected individuals are encouraged and provided with opportunities topursue this career path. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Promotion and management development practices seek a balance betweencareer operations individuals and others who obtain operations experienceas part of their career development. Operations personnel with the potentialto fill key management positions are provided an opportunity for acquiringexperience in other groups. Also, other personnel with the potential tofill key management positions are provided an opportunity for obtainingan SRO (Senior Reactor Operator) license or certification and operationsexperience. Engineers who hold bachelors degrees in technical fields areconsidered a key source of such personnel * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While a college degree in a technical field is not a necessary requirementfor operations positions, operators with bachelors degrees in technicalsubjects have a greater likelihood of promotion to and success in managementpositions. Management practices ensure that an appropriate number of personnelwith such degrees, or the potential and desire for acquiring such degrees,are selected for operations positions. In addition, management assistsand encourages selected operators who have the potential to acquire bachelorsdegrees; programs that lead to degrees in technical subjects are givenpreference. To assist in accomplishing this, college credits may be soughtfor successful completion of utility training programs.</ITAG>In addition, INPO has an effort underway to review the training and educationrequirements for shift supervisors, with the goal of ensuring that shiftsupervisors have the necessary knowledge, skills, understanding, and theeducation to supervise the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. The NRC monitors the level of technical knowledge of licensed operatingpersonnel with its licensing and requalification examinations and inspectionprograms to ensure that personnel holding these important positions arereceiving the training needed, and are otherwise qualified, to meet therequirements of the jobs. The Commission is convinced that the existinglevel of technical knowledge of licensed personnel is sufficient to safelyoperate nuclear power plants and ensure the protection of the health andsafety of the public. However, since the level of technical knowledge of the shift operatingstaff has a direct bearing on the safety of nuclear power plants, the Commissioncontinues to look for measures that can further improve the capabilityof the shift operating staff. The following policy statement presents ourviews concerning education for senior operators and shift supervisors.<ITAG tagnum="84">Policy Statement </ITAG>The Commission believes that the level of engineering and technical knowledgeof shift operating personnel has a direct bearing on the safety of nuclearpower plants. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the safety of commercialpower reactors is enhanced by having on each shift a team of NRC-licensedprofessionals \4\<NOTE/> that combine technical and academic knowledge with plant-specifictraining and substantial hands-on operating experience. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The term ``professionals'' is being used to refer to personswho have demonstrated competence to operate a nuclear power plant and whoadhere to the highest technical and ethical standards for reactor operations.These persons may or may not hold an academic degree.The Commission's position is predicated on the fact that, even though reactorlicensees try to anticipate and address in training programs and reactoroperating procedures all conceivable situations which could arise duringnormal and off-normal operation, there will always be the potential forsituations to arise which are not covered through training or operatingprocedures. The Commission is persuaded that there is a need for some individualson each nuclear power plant operating shift who have an innate understandingof the systems-level performance of a nuclear power plant. The types ofknowledge that are needed are scientific and engineering fundamentals andthe basic scientific principles that govern the behavior of electrical,mechanical, and other engineered systems. This is precisely the type ofknowledge that academic institutions develop and convey well and that formsthe basis of an academic degree program in a technical discipline. A programof scientific and engineering studies should provide plant operating personnelan enhanced capacity for reasoning and judgement, as well as enhanced confidence,to perform better during both normal and off-normal operation, but particularlyin the stressful and complex environment surrounding reactor transientsand accidents which may arise in the course of reactor operations. Individualswith such education can utilize their in-depth knowledge when called uponto assess the causes of a novel incident and determine the appropriateresponses.The Commission further believes that programs which encourage experiencednuclear professionals to obtain college degrees and personnel with degreesto obtain a senior operator license and hands-on operating experience createan important source of management talent for the industry. Such individualsare more likely to be selected for management positions and, because oftheir understanding of the unique operational problems associated withnuclear power plant operation, are in a better position to enhance nuclearsafety by fostering a strong safety culture within their organization.For there reasons, the Commission endorses the INPO ``Principles for EnhancingProfessionalism of Nuclear Personnel'' dated March 1, 1989, for implementationat each nuclear utility.Specifically, the Commission encourages nuclear plant licensees to continueto develop and implement programs that permit operating personnel to obtaincollege degrees from accredited institutions. Those persons with abilityand desire should be given every opportunity to further their educationin order to best serve the interest of nuclear safety.Additionally, the Commission encourages nuclear plant licensees to hirecollege graduates for positions on the operating staff. Licensees shouldactively work to make operating staff positions, including the plant specifictraining and development programs, attractive to college graduates withtechnical or science degrees in relevant disciplines from accredited institutions.The Commission particularly encourages the recruitment of graduates withphysical science, engineering, or engineering technology degrees from accreditedinstitutions which have accredited programs.Utilities should continue to develop reactor operators and senior operatorswho have a significant amount of hands-on operational experience. It isdesirable to have senior operators on shift who have progressed throughthe typical experience path, including the auxiliary operator and reactoroperator positions.The Commission recognizes the necessity for licensees to provide operatorson shift with a strong background of plant-specific, hands-on experience,regardless of whether those individuals have obtained college degrees.At the same time, the Commission believes that it is desirable for licenseesto ensure that they have in the control room individuals with academictraining as well. Ideally, licensees should strive to have in the controlroom individuals with a mix of education, training, and experience in plantoperations. This should be the goal during the coming years.The Commission encourages nuclear plant licensees to provide opportunitiesfor licensed operators and others with nuclear power plant operating experienceto assume positions of increased management responsibility. In the samevein, policies and programs which provide principal and cooperate nuclearmanagers with meaningful knowledge and experience in nuclear plant operations,including sufficient training and operational experience to qualify forand pass the NRC examination for a senior operator license, are valuableand should be encouraged.The shift supervisor occupies a unique position. Besides interacting directlywith the operating staff, the shift supervisor must also interact withupper management, and every effort should be made to ensure that the shiftsupervisor is an effective member of the facility management team. TheCommission believes that the highest priority should be given to assuringthat shift supervisors, and other individuals with similar decision-makingauthority on each shift, have appropriate levels of education in technicalfundamentals, training on the particular systems, and operating experience.The Commisison encourages INPO to complete the effort to review the adequacyof training and education requirements for the shift supervisor positionin a timely manner. The Commission understands that this effort is beingcoordinated with the industry accreditation program and the National Academyfor Nuclear Training and supports this concept. The Commission intendsto follow this effort closely and will participate as appropriate to ensuresuccessful closure of this issue.The Commission reaffirms its position, set forth in the Policy Statementon Engineering Expertise on Shift (50 FR 43621), that it is important tohave engineering and accident assessment expertise available to the operatingcrew at all nuclear power plants. The STA has proven to be a worthwhileaddition to the operating staff by providing an independent engineeringand accident assessment capability, and we support continuation of thisposition. However, the Commission wishes to reemphasize its preferencefor the STA to have a senior operator license, in order to enhance theSTA's operational knowledge and experience and to provide him or her greatercredibility with the other members of the operating staff. It remains theCommission's preference that all licensees continue to move toward thedual role (SO/STA) position. For those licensees who continue to use theSTA as a ``stand-alone'' position, the Commission reemphasizes its positionthat this individual should assume an active role in shift activities.The STA should maintain a continuing awareness of plant configuration andchanges in plant status and be an integral part of the operating shift.The licensed reactor operator, senior operator, and shift supervisor positionsare very important to the safe and reliable operation of nuclear powerplants. Therefore, utilities should continue their efforts to sustain andincrease, where appropriate, the professionalism of these positions. Thesepositions should be filled with individuals of the highest caliber andshould command respect and status both inside and outside the operationalorganization.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 9th day of August, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
