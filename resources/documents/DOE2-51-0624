An equation of state similar to the vander Waals has been suggested for these systems. Measurements in theseexperimental set-ups included pressure drops, particle velocities, andsolids mass flow rates in both the upper and lower halves of the pipe.These measurements were used to describe the phase behavior of the systemsstudied. It was found that the van der Waals analog is capable of describingthe phase behavior of these systems. A method has been proposed to estimatethe parameters of the van der Waals analog equation. The incorporationof dimensionless pressure drop into the analysis has been attempted bythe use of energy functions in thermodynamics. The effect of inclinationangle, pipe diameter, and particle characteristics on basic flow parameterswere studied. The ratio of solids flow in the top half to that of thebottom half of the pipe showed that the concentration gradient is influencedby particle characteristics, and by the pipe diameter and orientation.Glass test section was used in these systems for visual observationsof the flow patterns. 53 refs., 176 figs., 52 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
