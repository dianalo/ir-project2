Twelve Baladi and Bedouin goats were divided into two equalgroups and offered either river or salt water (1.8% Mediterranean seasalt). The animals were maintained in climatic chambers at 18 deg. Cand 70% RH for an initial four day period followed by another four daysat 38 deg. C and 50% RH for seven hours per day. On the second day ofeach period, each animal was injected intravenously with tritiated waterand total body water (TBW) determined. The percentage increase in TBWinduced by the high temperature treatment was subtracted from 100 andthe TBW heat tolerance index (HTI) was calculated. TBW-HTI correlatedsignificantly with the percentage increase in live body weight (LBW)in goats over a three month exposure to heat stress and with the percentagedecrease in daily milk yield over a seven day heat exposure period. TBW-HTIaverages of Baladi and Bedouin goats drinking river water were 81 and88 respectively while those drinking salt water were 86 and 92 respectively.The equations for the predicted percentage increase in liveweight (Y)in a hot environment for Baladi and Bedouin goats were Y = -38.56 + 0.728Xand Y = -45.27 + 0.622X respectively, where X is the TBW-HTI index; thepredicted percentage decrease in milk yield in a hot environment Y forall goats was Y = 142.28-1.339X.
