Banking and deposit-insurance reforms are much needed. Butsuch legislation could deform rather than reform the industrysimply because of many widely held misconceptions. Here are afew areas where facts should replace myths:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Myth 1: If the government could close problem banks whilethey still have capital -- say, 2% -- the FDIC couldliquidate the banks without loss.   Experience shows that when a bank is closed, the value ofits assets usually drops 10% to 15%. It loses its mainfranchise value, customers, employees and other values of agoing concern. In addition, there is no established marketfor the loans of banks whose assets must be liquidated.Purchasers need to research and evaluate the risk of evengood loans. The cost involved in making such purchasesfurther reduces values, particularly in today's recessionarymarkets. Take Bank of New England, which was closed when itscapital went to zero. The actual loss there will be close to12% of assets, or $2.5 billion.   Even if regulators were to close a bank when it has 2%capital instead of zero capital, the assets intended forlong-term investment simply could not be liquidated at thevalues of a going concern. The FDIC still would beliquidating (i.e., selling) the bank at a loss of at least 5%to 10%.                                                                                                          Myth 2: The &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; activities of the FDIC havebeen costly to the Bank Insurance Fund, and are a principalreason for its current low reserves.   The FDIC generally is required to handle bank failures ina manner that is no more costly than closing and liquidatingthe bank and then paying only the insured depositors.However, in cases where imposing losses on uninsureddepositors would result in unacceptable risk to the financialsystem, the FDIC can ignore its &quot;cost test.&quot; These exceptionshave become known as &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; cases.   Actually, this is not a deposit-insurance issue. Even ifthere were no FDIC, some government agency would have toconsider the possibility that a large bank failure couldresult in adverse macroeconomic consequences and instabilityin the financial system. Even countries without depositinsurance must face -- and do face -- this issue.   In the past five years, the FDIC has determined that onlyfour banks -- First National Bank andamp; Trust Co., Oklahoma City;MCorp of Dallas and First RepublicBank Corp., both in Texas;and Bank of New England Corp. -- were &quot;too big to fail&quot; inthe sense just described. The cost of protecting theinstitutions' deposits that exceeded the $100,000 insurancelimit was less than $1 billion, or about 3.5% of the FDIC'stotal insurance losses during this period.   In other cases where uninsured deposits above $100,000 areprotected, it is because a bid has been received that wouldbe less costly to the Bank Insurance Fund than a liquidation.                                                                                                          Myth 3: Small banks shoulder a greater burden of the costsof deposit insurance than do big banks.   This misconception is based in part on the thought thatthe FDIC's biggest cost must come from our biggest failures.Many also note that foreign deposits, held primarily by bigbanks, are protected by the FDIC in &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; caseseven though, under the law, banks pay no insurance assessmenton foreign deposits. However, FDIC data indicate that thelarge banks (those with assets of $1 billion or more) havebeen paying their fair share.   Our research shows that from 1985 through 1989, theselarge banks contributed about 70% of the insuranceassessments paid to the Bank Insurance Fund but wereresponsible for about half of the fund's resolution costs.Thus the smaller banks paid in about 30% of the insurancepremiums but accounted for about half the resolution costsduring this same five-year period. Even though there has beena recent trend toward increased costs from large-bankfailures, the premiums paid by big banks have beenproportional to their share of the resolution costs. In 1988and 1989, for example, large-bank resolution costsrepresented just under 70% of total resolution costs whiletheir share of total assessments was about 70%.   One reason big banks pay such a high proportion of theBank Insurance Fund assessments is that banks pay premiums onall domestic deposits, not just insured deposits. That wouldinclude, for example, deposits of more than $100,000, whichtypically are found in large banks. Based on these data, it'shard to say the premium burden is unfair to small banks.                                                                                                          Myth 4: Deposit insurance was enacted solely for theprotection of depositors.   Deposit insurance certainly is provided to protectdepositors. But it also has had the intended effect of givingsmall banks an opportunity to compete with big banks. Infact, when deposit insurance legislation was enacted in 1933,the primary political reason was that it had the support ofsmall banks that overrode the opposition of bigger banks.   Deposit insurance gives small banks the means to competewith large banks for deposits. Add up the number of banks,savings associations and credit unions in the U.S. that havedeposit insurance (about 30,000), and you have far more thanany other country. Any public-policy debate about limitingdeposit insurance coverage necessarily is about the kind ofbanking system we want in the U.S. and the role of smallbanks in the system.                                                                                                          Myth 5: In most small-bank failures, depositors withaccounts over $100,000 end up losing part of their deposits.   This is the flip-side of the &quot;too big to fail&quot; myth. Somepeople mistakenly believe that small-bank failures usuallyare resolved through a payout of insured deposits -- aliquidation, where uninsured depositors and creditors suffersome loss. The reality is that, currently, about nine out of10 small-bank failures are resolved through &quot;purchase andassumption&quot; transactions. In a Pandamp;A, all the deposits(including those over the $100,000 insurance limit) generallyare assumed by a healthy bank.   Of the 169 banks that failed in 1990, only 20 wereresolved through a payout of insured deposits. The rest wereresolved through Pandamp;As. We use the Pandamp;A route because it isless costly for the Bank Insurance Fund than a liquidation.                                                                                                          Myth 6: The Treasury Department's proposed legislation toreform the banking industry and the deposit insurance systemis a deregulation bill.   Although the Treasury proposal would permit bankinginstitutions to offer an expanded menu of financial services,the regulation of banks would be increased, not decreased.The bill would limit the types of activities that could bedone inside the bank, and it would force the riskieractivities into a separately capitalized entity not backed bydeposit insurance. The Treasury proposal would improveregulation by allowing supervisory &quot;early intervention&quot; inundercapitalized institutions before they become technicallyinsolvent. The bill also would require risk-based depositinsurance premiums and place additional emphasis on adequatecapital.   The Treasury approach is exactly the opposite of thederegulation of the Sandamp;L industry in the 1980s, when thriftswere allowed to engage in risky new activities inside thefederally insured Sandamp;L. The Treasury's suggestions are more ofa &quot;re-regulation&quot; plan than a deregulation plan for thebanks.   Let's hope Congress, with administration leadership, willsoon put to rest another myth -- the one that says a truemodernization of the banking and deposit insurance systems inthe U.S. will never happen.   ---   Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.</TEXT></DOC>
