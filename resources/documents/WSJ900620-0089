Some are more pushythan others; some are less willing to accommodate alternativeuses of public lands. But all are committed to the democraticprocess.   Today, however, an increasing number of environmentalactivists are unwilling to compromise, despite their pastsuccesses. Instead, they are taking the advice of DaveForeman, founder of Earth First], who recently urged thereaders of Mother Jones to commit civil disobedience: &quot;Youknow what you can do. Do it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Once that would have meant the sort of disruptive butnonviolent protests that Earth First] is scheduled to begintoday as part of a summer-long campaign to halt timbering innorthern California. However, despite their protestations tothe contrary, some may be moving toward violent activities.Late last month two Earth First] activists were arrested inOakland after a pipe bomb in their car exploded; both havebeen active in anti-logging activities and are beinginvestigated in connection with the bombing of a nearbylumber mill earlier in the month. (They deny knowledge of thebomb and claim someone was trying to assassinate them.) Mr.Foreman is facing trial, along with three others, forallegedly conspiring to down several electrical transmissiontowers.   Ecoterrorism first gained notoriety in the early 1970s,when a lone environmental activist, &quot;the Fox,&quot; engaged in asustained campaign of eco-sabotage, or ecotage, againstChicago-area firms. The late Edward Abbey romanticizedecoterrorism in his 1975 novel, &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang,&quot; inwhich four people roam the West wreaking unimaginable havoc.Mr. Abbey became a spiritual adviser to radicalenvironmentalists: &quot;If opposition is not enough, we mustresist. And if resistance is not enough, then subvert,&quot; hesaid.   Nevertheless, there was no formal structure for ecoteursuntil 1981, when Mr. Foreman, a former lobbyist for theWilderness Society, created Earth First]. Although theorganization does not formally engage in ecotage, Mr. Foremanconceded shortly after its formation that it was intended &quot;toinspire others to carry out activities straight from thepages of `The Monkey Wrench Gang.'&quot; Mr. Foreman has alsowritten two editions of &quot;Ecodefense: A Field Guide toMonkeywrenching,&quot; which offers detailed advice on how todrive spikes into trees to shatter chain saws and sawmillblades; scatter caltrops on roads to flatten tires; disableconstruction equipment; pull up mining markers and surveystakes; and fell powerlines, which, explains Mr. Foreman,&quot;are highly vulnerable to monkeywrenching from individuals orsmall groups.&quot;   Last year the Mountain States Legal Foundation establishedan ecotage hotline, which recorded sabotage in California,Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Tree spiking-- which almost killed a mill worker struck by a shatteredsaw blade in 1987 -- seems relatively common in theNorthwest. So is sabotage against construction and timberingequipment. A cross-country motor-cross race was halted whengarroting wire was strung at neck level. Ski lifts have beenvandalized, and other examples abound. Public officials playdown the importance of ecoterrorism, but Mr. Foreman arguesthat they are trying &quot;to keep it quiet&quot; because reportingsuch activities &quot;would only encourage similar acts by manymore of the millions of Americans who are strongly againstthe rape of what's left of our wilderness.&quot;   Of course, not everyone who is outraged over, say,government-subsidized timbering, which is bothenvironmentally destructive and financially wasteful, engagesin ecotage. Underlying the activities of many ecoteurs is thephilosophy of &quot;Deep Ecology,&quot; which places the preservationof nature above the promotion of humankind. In a sense it isa move back to pantheism, with the belief that nature issacred. Mr. Foreman, for one, has attacked the&quot;anthropocentric&quot; philosophy of the West, arguing that the&quot;wilderness has a right to exist for its own sake.&quot; He viewsmonkeywrenching as &quot;a form of worship toward the earth. It'sreally a very spiritual thing to go out and do.&quot;   Adequate legal penalties are a necessary part of anyeffort to combat ecoterrorism. Yet Western forest and rangelands are too sparsely populated to be well defended againstdetermined ecoterrorists. The best response is more subtle --environmentalist, community, business and political leadersneed to reinforce the basic belief, held by mostenvironmentalists, that violence is not justified as a meansof overturning defeats in the political arena, and that theprotection of human life remains people's paramountresponsibility.   Particularly important is the role of environmentalgroups. Since they are committed to many of the same goals asEarth First], they have a special duty to discourage violencein the name of the environment (as has Natural ResourcesDefense Council attorney Robert Kennedy, for example).   Moreover, pork-minded legislators need to abandon the sortof spendthrift and ruinous management policies that haverightly angered many environmentalists. Land should beprivatized and subsidies ended. That abuses exist is noexcuse for violence, but reforming current policy wouldreduce people's incentive to violate the law.   With groups apparently prepared to bomb sawmills, downelectrical towers, and decapitate cyclists -- and ads beingplaced for terminally ill volunteers to launch kamikazeattacks on dams -- ecoterrorism can no longer be dismissed asminor. We risk the development of an ecological guerrillamovement, one ready even to kill, unless all participants inthe political process reaffirm the importance of bothnonviolence and human life.   ---   Mr. Bandow, a Cato Institute fellow, is the author of &quot;ThePolitics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington&quot;(Transaction, 1990).
