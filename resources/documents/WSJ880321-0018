Bacon </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   No matter how he fares in his race for the presidency, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is off to a good start. Following strong showings in recent primaries, he has nearly as many delegates as Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the front-runner. His performance so far suggests some ability to reach a liberal constituency beyond the black vote that provides the bulk of his support. This success springs from a combination of personality and populism. He preaches basic values and economic justice: &quot;Workers, it's time for a change. Stop drugs from flowing in and stop jobs from flowing out.&quot;    He doesn't get bogged down in theory or detail; Mr. Jackson's pitch is simple. He calls for fairness: &quot;The American worker isn't asking for welfare, he's asking for a fair share -- not for charity but for parity.&quot; He rants against corporations, particularly those that use low-wage labor abroad: &quot;There's something wrong when corporate owners make exorbitant profits while workers lose their jobs.&quot; And he appeals to the dispossessed: &quot;On Oct. 19, the stock market crashed. But before the stock market crashed, 600,000 family farmers crashed. Auto workers crashed. . . . It's not right to invest in paper and wealth and not in people and industry.&quot;    Mr. Jackson gives the impression that the economy is flat on its back, when, in fact, general conditions aren't bad. The longest peacetime expansion continues. Inflation looks manageable. Some 14 million new jobs have been created since 1980; the 5.7% unemployment rate is the lowest since 1979. Mr. Jackson aims his appeal at the 5.7% of the work force that isn't employed and at those who fear they're about to lose their jobs to foreign competition. Also, he appears to be tapping a broader concern about the strength and fairness of the U.S. economy.    In this respect he's not alone. There appears to be a spreading sense of angst about whether the U.S. economy, burdened by debt, can hold its own. Yale historian Paul Kennedy has made it to the top of the best seller list with a book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,&quot; that questions whether the U.S. can afford to sustain its military commitments and &quot;preserve the technological and economic bases of its power from relative erosion.&quot; According to the National Journal, &quot;a clear plurality&quot; in a recent survey by the World Policy Institute &quot;cited economic problems as the greatest threat to America's future -- far more than chose terrorism or Soviet military power.&quot;    Statistical evidence already suggests that the American dream is fading. Economic growth has slowed to an average of 2.4% a year between 1973 and 1986 from an average annual rate of 3.7% between 1948 and 1973. The deceleration in the rise of family income is more dramatic. Since 1973, real median family income has edged up at an average of 0.5% a year; in the 20 years up to 1973, real median family income grew at an annual average of 3.1%.    With sluggish growth in income and slower improvement in the standard of living, the gap between rich and poor has widened. The share of money income received by the top 20% of the population, ranked by income, has risen since 1969. The share of income going to the lowest quintile of the population fell to 4.6% in 1986 from 5.6% in 1969. Joseph Minarik of the Urban Institute calculates that the one percentage point decline means that the bottom quintile has lost about $22.5 billion in income, or roughly $1,750 per family.    Politicians like to blame such discouraging trends on specific villains: President Reagan's policies, unfair foreign competition, a lack of worker rights. &quot;We're caught between cheap labor at home and slave labor abroad,&quot; Mr. Jackson charges.    But Mr. Minarik warns against easy explanations. &quot;The changes in incomes and inequality over the 1970s and 1980s have no clear cause,&quot; he contends in a new Urban Institute study entitled &quot;Challenge to Leadership: Economic and Social Issues for the Next Decade.&quot; Analysts suggest a number of causes and most were made in America: a surge in inexperienced workers as babyboomers entered the work force, our response to the energy crisis, a slowdown in the rate of capital investment per worker, distortions caused by inflation, the cost of increased government regulation. These also are some of the explanations for the disappointing growth in productivity -- or output per hour worked -- since the early 1970s.    Good politicians can make solutions to complex problems sound simple and quick, although they seldom are. The Urban Institute points out that long-term policies offer the best hope of reversing long-term trends in family income growth and distribution. Faster, more stable growth of output and productivity is one key. Another is better education -- from preschool to adulthood -- to improve work force skills. Even if there's a consensus on how to proceed, these solutions will be difficult or expensive to achieve.    ---                   Growing Income Inequality    Percentage of money income received by each quintile. -    Year    Lowest     2nd     Middle     4th     Highest    1969     5.6      12.4      17.7     23.7      40.6    1974     5.5      12.0      17.5     24.0      41.0    1979     5.2      11.6      17.5     24.1      41.7    1980     5.1      11.6      17.5     24.3      41.6    1981     5.0      11.3      17.4     24.4      41.9    1982     4.7      11.2      17.1     24.3      42.7    1983     4.7      11.1      17.1     24.3      42.8    1984     4.7      11.0      17.0     24.4      42.9    1985     4.6      10.9      16.9     24.2      43.5    1986     4.6      10.8      16.8     24.0      43.7    Source: U.S. Census Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
