The forces exerted on the filling mass aremainly determined by the forces in the haulage chain strands, the widthof the rock attachments and the incidence of the front plates relativeto the coal face. Up to 150 kN, increasing the forces in the haulagechain causes a sharp rise in the forces exerted onto the filling rock,above this level there is only a small increase. Demonstrates with formulaeand a nomogram that to increase the forces exerted on the filling massand hence improve the density of the bearing strip, the width of therock attachment and the incidence of its front plate should be reducedand its length increased, this may be done at the design stage and correctedduring operation. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
