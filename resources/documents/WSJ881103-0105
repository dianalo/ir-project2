The U.S. has enjoyed 71 consecutive months of economic growth, with precipitous declines in unemployment, inflation and interest rates, as well as record job creation and record high levels of income. Yet there remains a group of vociferous dissenters unwilling to concede that America has prospered in the 1980s.    Indeed, a recent spate of articles has appeared in several respected publications suggesting that, on balance, the economic situation of most Americans may actually have worsened rather than improved since 1980. The pertinent question, they maintain, is not whether the average American is better off today, but whether the rewards of economic growth over the past eight years have been distributed equitably among the most and least well-off. In other words: How fair are we as a nation?    Writing for The Atlantic Monthly last June, Washington Post reporter Thomas Byrne Edsall asserted that &quot;{n}ot just the chasm between the rich . . . and the poor . . . but the gap between the rich and the great American middle class has grown wider over the past decade.&quot; This theme was picked up by Time in an article last month by George A. Church, which concluded that &quot;{t}he Reagan boom, for all its success, has not distributed its benefits evenly,&quot; and that &quot;while the gains of the rich have been spectacular, those of the middle class have been barely sufficient, and those of the poor not quite sufficient, to get them back where they were 12 to 15 years ago.&quot; Joining in along the same lines was The New Republic in an editorial published in October, which lamented that &quot;{t}he distribution of income is now the most uneven it's been since the government started keeping reliable numbers on the subject in the 1940s.&quot;    There is a kernel of truth to each of these assertions. In the 1980s, those who were affluent became even more affluent. The &quot;great American middle class&quot; shrank somewhat in size. The poor remained pretty much in place. And the distribution of income became slightly more uneven between those on the higher and lower ends of the scale. On the face, these developments seem &quot;unfair,&quot; but upon examination, they are not.    The complaint that the income gap between rich and poor has grown wider suggests that the rich have prospered at the expense of the poor. This is simply untrue. In fact, income trend lines for the past eight years show an upward movement for all income brackets, from bottom to top. As our accompanying chart illustrates, the percentage of American families earning less than $12,500 annually (in constant 1987 dollars) has actually declined slightly since 1980. (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ November 3, 1988) The movement out of this income group has been up the scale, not down. We note a similar decline with the next income group ($12,500 to $24,999). If these families had lost ground, then it should be reflected in a larger percentage of families in the lowest income bracket, but that is not the case. They, too, have moved up the scale.    The percentages of families in the next two income groups ($25,000 to $34,999 and $35,000 to $50,000) have also declined. This is especially significant because it explains a phenomenon of the past eight years that has been greatly misinterpreted by liberal economists. On the face, it appears that the middle class has shrunk, or that it has been &quot;squeezed,&quot; as Michael Dukakis has frequently lamented in his campaign appearances. But when we look down the income scale, we find that the other brackets have also gotten smaller. Since these middle-class families have not fallen back into the lower-income classes, and they have not simply &quot;disappeared,&quot; they could only have moved in one direction -- upward. In fact, the data show a 30% increase in the percentage of families in the highest income bracket (as defined by the Census Bureau).    These across-the-board family-income gains are all the more impressive, in light of demographic changes on the American landscape. The most significant may be the continued burgeoning of the ranks of families headed by unmarried women. Such families constitute half of the U.S. poverty population. And the reason is that fewer than half of women heading families are full-time, year-round workers. The reason that the incidence of poverty has not declined measurably over the course of the decade, even with the longest postwar economic expansion, and even with the creation of more than 20 million new jobs, is that a certain, unfortunate segment of the population has become prosperity-proof.    We needn't worry as much about the two-parent families falling below the poverty line. So long as one or both parents work steadily, full-time, year-round, the family is almost guaranteed to lift itself out of poverty. To put this another way, if a two-parent family were poor in 1980, it is better than 90% certain that it will not be poor in 1988. It may seem anachronistic, but the best way to improve the economic prospects of poor families is to encourage family cohesion.    As for the income-distribution curve, it has indeed become slightly more uneven since 1980. The lowest fifth of families received 4.6% of income in 1987 compared with 5.1% in 1980; the highest fifth received 43.7% of income in 1987 compared with 41.6% in 1980. But this is not a trend that suddenly began in this decade. It has been developing since the late 1960s, ironically coinciding with the advent of the Great Society transfer programs (which were supposed to mitigate income inequality).    Moreover, income distribution is extremely misleading as a measure of &quot;fairness.&quot; A more reliable measure is income mobility. To wit, the table below is derived from a longitudinal study of income dynamics, conducted over an eight-year span, 1971 through 1978, by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. It illustrates that during those years only about half of those who were the most well-off in the first year were still among the most well-off by the eighth year, and only about half of those who were the least well-off were still in that category.    If we assume that this mobility curve has held up in the 1980s (and the available evidence suggests that it has), then this means that of those families mired in the lowest-earning quintile in 1980 (earning no more than $10,286 at the time), 22% now earn up to $24,020 (based on Census Bureau calculations of income distribution); 9.5% earn up to $35,015; 7% earn up to $50,370; and 6% earn more than $50,370. Thus, the fact that the lowest-income quintile received only 4.6% of total income last year, or any year, is unimportant. What is important is that those who are on the low end of income distribution in a given year are unlikely to remain there over time.    There is perhaps more mobility between income classes in the U.S. than in any other nation in the world. And that is why we can say with conviction that, by and large, income fairness reigns in America. Our intuition tells us that lower-earning Americans are more optimistic about their prospects for upward mobility than those who purport to speak on their behalf. They do not ask that the existing income pie be re-sliced, only that the pie continue to expand.    ---   Mr. Perkins is a Journal editorial-page writer.
