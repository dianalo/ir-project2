The increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index wasmarkedly smaller than the 0.9 percent jump in September but wasstill surprisingly high to many economists.   The September and October advances followed rare monthlydeclines in July and August.   Prices have been on a roller coaster this year, first surgingahead and then easing during the summer after food and energy costsmoderated.   For the first 10 months of the year, wholesale prices have beenrising at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, compared with an increaseof 4 percent for all of 1988.   Food costs rose a steep 1.4 percent in October, followingdeclines in three of the four previous months. Analysts said thejump in food costs reflected in part bad weather that affectedCalifornia and Florida vegetable crops.   Vegetable prices shot up 18.9 percent. Other big advances in thefood category were a 9.5 percent increase in pork costs, a 5.6percent rise in fish prices and a 4.9 percent increase for fruit.   The overall 1.4 percent advance in food costs was the biggestadvance since a 1.5 percent rise in January 1988. But analysts saidthe one-month increase in the volatile food category was notalarming given the fact that food costs had been falling.   Economists said they continued to believe that slower economicgrowth would translate into lower inflationary pressures in themonths ahead.   ``Assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable,we expect further moderation in prices in 1990,'' said StacyKottman, assistant director of economic forecasting at GeorgiaState University.   Energy costs, which had been the driving force behind theSeptember spurt in the overall index, moderated in October to aslight 0.2 percent increase, far below the 6.5 percent surge in theprevious month.   Gasoline prices were up 2.3 percent after a 10.6 percent jump inSeptember. The cost of natural gas dropped by 2.5 percent whilehome heating prices fell by 0.5 percent last month.   Wholesale prices, excluding energy and food costs, were up atiny 0.1 percent in October. Many analysts consider this figure abetter gauge of underlying inflationary pressures.   New-car prices, which had also been a major factor in theSeptember inflation report, fell by 1.4 percent in October at thestart of the new model year.   Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesaleprice index stood at 114.8 in October. This meant that ahypothetical marketbasket of goods that cost $100 in the base yearof 1982 would have cost $114.80 last month, up from a cost of$109.40 a year ago.   Many economists are looking for price increases to be moderatefor the rest of this year and into 1990 as inflation is held incheck by a slowing economy. This forecast is based on a belief thatthere will be no special factors pushing up costs, such as the 1988drought that caused food prices to soar.   As 1989 began, policymakers at the Federal Reserve were pushinginterest rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures.   However, they switched tactics in May and started lowering ratesin an effort to keep the economy from tumbling into a recession.   The latest round of interest rate declines came this week whenthe Fed boosted the amount of cash reserves available to thebanking system. This allowed the federal funds rate to fall from8.75 percent to 8.5 percent. This rate, which is the interest bankscharge each other to make overnight loans, is a key short-termlending rate which is closely watched for clues to Fed policyintentions.   The Fed action came after weeks of complaints from the Bushadministration that the central bank was moving too slowly to lowerinterest rates and would have to shoulder the blame if the economytoppled into a recession.   Economists predicted the Fed's move would translate into lowerconsumer and business loan rates, including an expected cut in thebenchmark prime lending rate from 10.5 percent down to 10 percent.The prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than one-thirdof all business and consumer loans.</TEXT></DOC>
