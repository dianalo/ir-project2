Williams, an independentanalyst with a specialty in forecasting interest rates forinstitutional clients.   Querying 113 of his brethren at a meeting of the NationalAssociation of Business Economists recently, he found 72 percent ofthem weren't happy with the quality of data. Many said it wasdeteriorating.   It's worth noting, ``and perhaps a little frightening,'' heobserves, that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers thatgenerally are given the most weight by financial decision-makers.   He says that because he found his colleagues especiallyskeptical about the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues thegross national product figures, and the Bureau of the Census, whosenumbers include retail sales.   He did not offer the example that follows, but it probablyserves as well as any to illustrate what he is talking about.   The illustration relates to economic conditions during mid-year1986, when much of the country was experiencing economic problems.   On July 22 of that year the government reported thatsecond-quarter GNP had grown at a 1.1 percent rate, down sharplyfrom a first-quarter rate of just under 4 percent. The economy wasstill expanding, it said, but sluggishly.   One year later, on July 24, 1987, the report was revised to showa gain of only 0.6 percent. After still another revision, on July27, 1988, the tiny 0.6 percent growth was turned into an 0.8percent decline.   The revisions continued. On July 27, 1989, a full percentagepoint was added to the 0.8 percent decline, making for asubstantial, 1.8 percent shrinkage of gross national product forthe second quarter of 1986.   It wasn't the only revision. GNP for the third quarter of 1986,initially reported as growth of 1.4 percent, also was reviseddownward. It became 1 percent in 1988, and only 0.8 percent in the1989 revision.   Should the pattern of downward revisions continue next year, inthe summer of 1990, it will mean that way back in 1986, the UnitedStates economy was in recession. Two back-to-back quarters of GNPshrinkage defines recession.   One critic of the government's GNP numbers doubts that it willtake place. Albert Sindlinger, a pioneer in economic measurements,says ``It would be very embarrassing in 1990 to tell America it hada recession four years earlier.''   He has a special interest in the changing numbers because, basedon data he had assembled and distributed to clients at the time, 31states making up 49.5 percent of the U.S. population were inrecession in the second quarter of 1986.   The recession states _ associated with minerals, heavy industry,farming, oil and lumber _ knew they were in recession, he said. Butmuch of the country had no idea. In the national numbers, coastalbooms offset the negatives.   More than embarrassing in all this is the fact that importantpersonal, business and governmental business was affected by theincorrect government numbers.   Decisions are made within seconds of the initial announcements.Once made, those decisions forever skew the economy's path. Theycannot be revised.   There may be no easy way to correct the problem. Perhaps most ofthe revisions made in economic data result from additionalinformation unavailable earlier. Economic information must betimely; it is perishable.   Economists interviewed by Williams, who operates under the nameAmerican Business Econometrics, seemed to suggest that personnelimprovements might help. Eighty-two percent of them agreed thatinsufficient funding and staffing were causes of poor quality. Morethan half cited data-gathering techniques.   A Washington environment that often leads to political-economicclashes was all but absolved of blame. Relatively few economists,said Williams, believe the quality of federal numbers is damaged bypolitical manipulation.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, Oct 10</NOTE></DOC>
