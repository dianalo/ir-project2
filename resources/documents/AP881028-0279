His rubberducky drowned in the bathtub.'' He invoked a spy novel to advocateanti-satellite missiles. He referred to the Holocaust as ``anobscene period in our nation's history'' and sought to recover bysaying ``I didn't live in this century.'' He mangled a basketballcoach's sentiments about offense and defense. Then, seeking to clearthe air, he brought forth a pasta which, should they stumble on itin stone, promises to confound future archaeologists to the end oftime:   ``Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, abetter prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the firstplace to have a reduction in offensive systems and an introductionto defensive capability. I believe that is the route this countryeventually will go.''   Marilyn Quayle did what she could. She protested that her husbandis intelligent, really is the ``studious sort'' who ``tries to readPlato's Republic every year.''   George Bush came perilously close to violating Section 4, Article(d) of Public Law 829, which specifically stipulates that ``the flagshould never be used as drapery of any sort whatsoever.'' He wrappedhimself in Old Glory and never let go.   He said he favored requiring public school teachers to leadstudents in the pledge of allegiance to the flag while his rival wasopposed. In subsequent speeches, he wondered aloud why this pathtoward eternal truth was so clear to him and not to Dukakis, who, heimplied, was denying children their birthright. He didn't sayDukakis opposed a mandatory pledge on constitutional grounds.   Dukakis went to Ellis Island and there, with the Statue ofLiberty behind him and 76 huge American flags waving in the breeze,he placed his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegianceand two days later Dan Quayle went to the Statue of Liberty andplaced his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegiance andthen the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pledge itsallegiance before every session and Bush made a speech before thebiggest flag imaginable at a flag factory and soon, everywhere thecandidates went, flags of all sizes multiplied like crab grass andthe multitudes were waving small flags given to them to wave, smallplastic flags made in Taiwan.   It remained only for Ronald Reagan to hone the issue. He said hedid not ``see any reason why they should not learn the variouscustoms and so forth that have to do with things of that kind.''   For candidates and public alike, Campaign 1988 proved anendurance contest. It began more than two years and 876,432 speechesago. It involved 75 primaries and , at the peak, 14 candidates untiltwo of the Democrats were benched for philandering and plagiarism.Finally Dukakis beat Jesse Jackson and four other Democrats. Bushlicked five Republicans and Dan Rather.   By convention time, the two survivors seemed transformed. GeorgeBush, ex-wimp, broke from the barrier in full gallop, shooting fromboth hips. Dukakis, ex-drone, seemed almost lyrical in hisacceptance speech. Campaigning, Bush grew more aggressive; Dukakis,less poetic.   Lloyd Bentsen confirmed that Dan Quayle was no John Kennedy, butotherwise history will have difficulty remembering the debates of1988. They provided some canned heat, less light. Most of the time,the debaters did not answer questions. They fudged the beginning ofan answer and then _ one, two, three _ turned soulful eyes towardthe camera and, with great solemnity, rolled through their packagedirrelevancies.   On the stump, Bush fired off zingers like: Dukakis thinks a navalmaneuver is something in Jane Fonda's workout book. Dukakis came outfour-square for good jobs at good wages. In full stride, Bush fellover Pearl Harbor Day and missed the event by four months. Dukakisbitterly decried the dangers of foreign ownership at a Missourifactory he didn't know was owned by Italians.   Bush found some cops to endorse him. Dukakis found some cops onhis side. Bush said that Massachusetts ``is approaching a fiscalfiasco...a budgetary Three Mile Island.'' Dukakis said anyone whowould say that about his state's economy ``must be suffering frommeltdown.''   Bush blamed Dukakis for Boston's dirty harbor. Dukakis said Bushwas part of the administration's environmental ``wrecking crew.''Bush said Dukakis was soft on crime. Dukakis said the Bush campaignwas ``racist.''   On a Wednesday, the Dukakis camp issued a five-page documenttitled ``George Bush Distorts Mike Dukakis' Record.'' On Thursday,Bush headquarters issued 127 pages in rebuttal of the rebuttal.Behind the infantry, the artillery of each man's computers could befired immediately.   Boom, boom. Zap, zap. Ho, hum. The polls showed Bush was winningbut more people were turned off by both candidates.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 6</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
