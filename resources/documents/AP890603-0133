Oh my God!'' cried Choi Soon, 32, breaking intosobs as she listened to radio reports in a park across from SanFrancisco City Hall. ``How can the government kill? Those are mybrothers and sisters in the square and they are being murdered.''   About 300 protesters gathered at the Chinese consulate in SanFrancisco.   Chinese and Chinese-Americans also took their fear and anger tothe streets in Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans, Houston, St.Paul, Minn.; and Buffalo, N.Y. In Connecticut, the state House helda silent tribute.   ``It's so horrible,'' Lea Liang said during a rally at theChinese consulate in New York by more than 300 chanting, screamingand weeping protesters.   ``I can't believe they used the army _ the People's Army _ onthe people,'' said Ms. Liang, a Chinese-American. ``This hurts verymuch.''   A smaller demonstration, attended by Mayor Edward I. Koch andU.S. Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., was held in lower Manhattan withinsight of the Statue of Liberty.   ``All of us here must say no to the government of China and tothe military suppression in China,'' organizer Alfred Lui told thecrowd.   ``Down with a government that kills students,'' said a signcarried by accountant Ivy Ng.   In Los Angeles, about 50 people staged a sit-in on the steps ofChinese consulate, weeping as the protesters played a recording ofwhat they said were telephone conversations with relatives andfriends in Beijing as they witnessed the Army sweep of TiananmenSquare.   ``We are very disappointed and angry with the Chinesegovernment,'' said Richard Leung, a protest organizer and studentat the University of California-Los Angeles. ``We urge the U.S.authorities to make every effort to support human rights and stopthe bloodshed.''   President Bush said in a statement from Kennebunkport, Maine,Saturday, ``I deeply deplore the decision to use force againstpeaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.'' He calledfor ``nonviolence, restraint and dialogue.''   It was early Sunday in Beijing, 13 hours ahead of the easternUnited States, when Chinese troops stormed through masses ofpro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, shooting and beatinghundreds of people. At least 500 were reported killed.   In St. Paul, about 250 Chinese students marched around theMinnesota Capitol. Wearing black armbands and green and whiteribbons, a Chinese symbol of mourning, they bowed their heads inmemory of the slain.   At a rally at Louisiana State University Medical Center, Gan XiaGe, a 31-year-old graduate student, said, ``I'm worried about mybrother. The army is just shooting people. He may be dead.''   ``I'd like to be there with them, but I think we can also dosomething here in America,'' said Philip Lam, a Los Angelesdemonstration organizer. ``I hope we get people outside of China tosupport this movement, which is not for or against any politicalparty, but just for democracy.''   About a dozen organizers, most of them students andprofessionals from Hong Kong, distributed blue ribbons topassers-by at the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Statue in Los Angeles'Chinatown.   ``The ribbons stand for freedom, dignity and hope for thestudents in China,'' said Leung.   An Iowa state senator who returned Friday from a three-weekexchange program in China said that when his group of U.S.politicians met with the protesters they seemed to be bracing forconfrontation.   ``You could sense that there was an uneasiness,'' Sen. Paul Patesaid. ``They said they knew that there was a crackdown coming.''   Judith Shapiro, a scholar who met husband Liang Heng in Chinaduring the 1970s and wrote two books about that country with him,said the violence created a serious potential for civil war.   ``I think that until today many students and intellectualsbelieved that the Communist Party was genuinely trying to reformitself from within,'' Ms. Shapiro said.   ``But with the results of today's actions, the Chinese party haslost any semblance of legitimacy for these people. These peoplefeel deeply betrayed; they're deeply angry,'' said Ms. Shapiro, whoworks for the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think tank inElkins Park, Pa.   The crackdown could badly damage China's ability to attractneeded dollars through tourism, exports and investments, aprofessor said.   ``It's not hard to imagine that a lot of people are going to bereluctant to put money into China now for obvious reasons,'' TuftsUniversity political science professor Don Klein said in Boston. Henoted that the United States is second only to Japan in providingtourists to China, which he said netted $2 billion from thatindustry last year.   The Connecticut House of Representatives interrupted a debate ona prison overcrowding bill to stand in silence as a salute to theChinese students. Rep. Richard Tulisano told the hushed chamber inHartford, ``What is going on in China is what happened in thiscountry 200 years ago.''</TEXT></DOC>
