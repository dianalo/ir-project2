Gorbachev told the otherSoviet bloc leaders Friday they are free to pursue their own viewsof communism, but suggested his own program of economic and socialreform as a guide.   ``Each country and each party has its own specifics and cancontinue its own individual road to socialist democracy andprogress,'' he said in a dinner toast after the first day of aWarsaw Pact summit.   His host at the banquet was President Nicolae Ceausescu ofRomania, the most vocal critic of Gorbachev's reforms.   The alliance's seven members are divided over the new policies,with the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland on the liberal side andBulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania sticking to theorthodox course.   Their purposes at this summit are to discuss Westernarms-reduction proposals and the Warsaw Pact's role in a new worldwhere Gorbachev speaks of a ``common European home'' with no threator fear of war.   In his dinner toast, the Soviet president said: ``We took newsteps today toward European security, rapprochement and East-Westdialogue.'' He also condemned unspecified ``forces'' that wantmilitary confrontation.   Ceausescu renewed what he described as the Soviet bloc's ``appealto NATO to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence.''   Neither he nor Gorbachev mentioned what was decided Friday.   Reporters were barred from the conference itself, but wereadmitted to the banquet hall in the former royal palace long enoughto hear the brief dinner toasts.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told anearlier news briefing Gorbachev and his colleagues discussed NATOproposals for reducing conventional forces, and how the Soviet bloc``should change, adapt ... become contemporary.''   ``Everybody would agree there are vast changes, in our country,in the world,'' Gerasimov said. ``They are talking about the role ofthe Warsaw Pact in these changing conditions.''   Gerasimov was evasive about whether the topics at the two-daysummit would include political divisions within the bloc.   Ion Diaconu of the Romanian Foreign Ministry refused comment on areport by the Soviet news agency Novosti that the leaders werediscussing creation of a Warsaw Pact ``political commission'' toarbitrate disputes between members.   Diaconu denied reports that Romania had requested a discussion atthe summit of its feud with Hungary over Romania's allegedmistreatment of its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians.   Gerasimov said disputes within the bloc were not on the agenda,but ``each delegation can say a few words about its own problems.''   He said Gorbachev and other leaders addressed the meeting Friday,but gave no details of the deliberations.   Reporters were admitted to the palace for a few minutes whileCeausescu greeted his guests.   Gorbachev said in West Germany last month that the Bucharestsummit would respond to President Bush's proposal May 29 for a jointreduction in U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in Europe to 275,000for each side by 1993, accompanied by cuts in combat aircraft andother conventional weapons.   The Soviet leader said the Bush proposal, which will not be onthe table until September, had increased chances for quick agreementat Vienna negotiations on conventional forces.   He also is pushing for talks with NATO on reducing tactical, orshort-range, nuclear weapons in Europe, but the United States wantsthe issue tied to cuts in conventional forces.   West Germany, where most of NATO's battlefield nuclear weaponsare stationed, favors talks. The disagreement between the two alliessubsided after Bush made his conventional disarmament offer and saidit could be agreed within a year.   On Thursday, during a visit to France, Gorbachev again tried topush the Western alliance into talks on the short-range weapons,offering the possibility of more unilateral cuts in the Kremlin'snuclear arsenal if NATO agreed.   His last offer to scrap nuclear weapons _ about 500 warheads _came in May during a visit to Moscow by Secretary of State James A.Baker III, while NATO was arguing about short-range missiles.   There was unconfirmed speculation in Bucharest that documentsreleased after the summit ends Saturday might include numbers forthe Strasbourg offer.   Presidents, Communist Party chiefs, premiers, defense and foreignministers and other ranking offiials from the seven Warsaw Pactnations are attending the summit.   Romanian television broadcast scenes of delegations arriving onThursday. Rezsoe Nyers, the Hungarian party chairman, appeared to bethe only delegation head Ceausescu did not greet with a comradelykiss on the cheek.   After Gorbachev arrived, reporters asked him what he expected ofthe summit.   ``I'll tell you when we've finished,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
