Proceeds will be used to reduce bank debt.    The natural-gas utility's current cash flow, seasonally weak, has been further eroded by lawsuit settlements totaling $112.6 million. Additionally, an Oklahoma jury recently ordered the Tulsa, Okla.-based company to pay Denver-based Forest Oil Corp. about $50 million to settle a dispute over natural-gas supplies. Oneok said it will appeal that ruling.    In anticipation of that judgment, however, the company shrank its labor force, cut capital-spending plans in half and omitted two consecutive dividends.    A spokeswoman said Oneok &quot;has a poor cash flow position and needs to raise funds to meet its operating expenses.&quot; The company didn't disclose the estimated value or size of the reserves on the block.    Separately, Oneok said it entered into a $100 million short-term financing agreement with Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles. </TEXT></DOC>
