I often did drawings and my grandmother would tell me that they werebeautiful. It was terrific encouragement for a young artist.&quot;;    She marriedartist Tony May, and moved to San Jose in 1971. Raising two children, shebegan making quilts for the family. Her designs, which combined traditionalquilt techniques with photo imagery and painted surfaces, caught the attentionof friends and gallery owners.;    &quot;I love working with quilts because so muchof the color and texture is already there in the fabric. I figure out thedesign on grid paper first, then piece the colors together. It's slow, likemeditation.&quot;;    The artist says she has grown more confident of her craftover the years, and their colors are getting lighter and brighter. &quot;Livingwith my quilts, I can see my own evolution as an artist. The patterns todaylook very optimistic,&quot; says May with a smile.;    Therese May's quilts areavailable through Viewpoint Gallery, Carmel, and Allegra Gallery, San Jose.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Diane Dorrans Saeks  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910407  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  24  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  441  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 7, 199100098254,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
