Thegas is intended to fuel a new power plant to be built by Ocean State inRhode Island, scheduled to begin operation in late 1989. The new facilitiesrequired to supply the power plant with gas include pipeline looping adjacentto Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's (Tennessee) existing gas transmissionpipeline in New York and Massachusetts, and a new pipeline in Massachusettsand Rhode Island.  A copy of that order is available for inspection and copying in the NaturalGas Division Docket Room, 3F-056, Forrestal Building, 1000 IndependenceAvenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9478. The Docket Room is openbetween the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, exceptFederal holidays.In conjunction with the order, the ERA is issuing this Record of Decision,pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Part1505) implementing the procedural provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the DOE's guidelines for compliance withNEPA (52 FR 47662, December 15, 1987). The ERA has two alternative coursesof action it may take in processing an application to import natural gas.It may grant the application (with or without conditions) or deny the application.In deciding to approve the authorization requested by Ocean State, theERA considered the competitiveness of the import in the markets served,need for the supply, security of supply, and the environmental impact ofthe proposal. The ERA relied on the <T3>Ocean State Power Project Final Environmental Impact Statement</T3>(FEIS) issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on July11, 1988 (FERC/EIS-0050), in assessing the environmental effects of grantingthe import. The FEIS which was adopted by the DOE (DOE/EIS-0140) examinesthe impacts of constructing both the power plant and the additional transmissionfacilities.ERA concluded that the proposed import, which will be made under a market-responsivegas purchase contract containing flexible price adjustment terms and notake-or-pay requirement, meets the DOE guidelines concerning competitiveness,need for the supply, and security of supply, and is consistent with thepublic interest. In addition, the ERA determined that the import authorizationwould have limited environmental impacts and would be environmentally acceptable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Allyson C.

Decision</ITAG>In DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 243 issued on June 13, 1988, in ERA DocketNo. 86-62-NG, the ERA conditionally authorized Ocean State Power to importup to 100,000 Mcf per day of Canadian natural gas over a 20-year term,beginning on the date of the first delivery, to fuel a new power plantit plans to build in Burrillville, Rhode Island. The power plant is scheduledto begin operation in late 1989. The authorization was conditioned on theDOE's review of the FEIS being prepared for the Ocean State project bythe FERC. Subsequently, the review was completed, the FEIS was adoptedby the DOE, and a final authorization approving the import was issued toOcean State on September 14, 1988, in DOE/ERA Opinion and Order No. 243-A.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Project Description</ITAG>The project involves phased construction and operation by Ocean State,a general partnership, of two natural gas-fired, 250-megawatt combinedcycle electric generating units, a 10-mile pipeline to transport processand cooling water to the plant from the Blackstone River, and a 7.5-milepipeline to deliver No. 2 fuel oil to the site for emergency use when naturalgas may not be available. Interrelated with the Ocean State project, TennesseeGas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), a division of Tenneco, Inc., proposesto construct additional new pipeline facilities to supply the the importedgas for the power plant. The new facilities required by Tennessee includea total of 25.5 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline looping in five separatesegments located adjacent to existing gas transmission pipelines in NewYork and Massachusetts and a new delivery lateral, consisting of 11 milesof 20-inch diameter pipeline from Sutton, Massachusetts to Burrillville,Rhode Island (the Rhode Island Extension). The Rhode Island Extension wouldbe used to serve the Ocean State project as well as provide service toProvidence, Rhode Island. Increases in compression on Tennessee's pipelineat three existing compressor stations in New York and Massachusetts anda new compressor station in New York are also needed to enable Tennesseeto deliver the gas.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Governmental Responsibilities</ITAG>For Ocean State's proposed project, the issuance of several major permitsand authorizations are required before the project can proceed. On November19, 1986, Ocean State filed an application with the ERA in ERA Docket No.86-62-NG for authorization under Section 3 of the NGA to import gas fromCanada to be used for fuel at the power plant. Ocean State also filed anexemption petition with the ERA on December 31, 1986, pursuant to the Powerplantand Industrial Fuel Act (FUA) of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-620) to exempt the powerplant from the statutory requirement that it be capable of using coal oranother alternate fuel as a primary energy source instead of natural gasor oil. On June 29, 1988, Ocean State submitted, pursuant to the FUA Amendmentsof 1987 (Pub. L. 100-42), a coal capability certification in place of thepreviously requested exemption. Consequently, the power plant is no longerwithin the ERA's jurisdiction under the FUA. While construction of thepower plant is not within the ERA's jurisdiction, a license is necessaryfrom the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board (EFSB).The FERC has the responsibility under sections 3 and 7 of the NGA, respectively,to approve the place of entry for imports whenever the import involvesthe construction of new domestic facilities and to certificate the pipelinefacilities supplying the gas. Inasmuch as the gas pipeline facilities improvement/extensionproposed by Tennessee is a related part of the Ocean State project, Tennesseefiled applications with the FERC on December 18, 1986, (FERC Docket Nos.CP87-75-000, CP87-131-000, CP87-131-001, CP87-132-000, and CP87-132-001)to construct and operate the facilities which would be used to transportthe gas for the Ocean State project.The EFSB and the FERC must still make final decisions on their authorizations.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Description of Alternatives</ITAG>The FEIS concluded that it is likely that there will be a need for additionalpower resources in New England to meet the expected future increases inelectricity consumption. The FEIS also determined that if the demand forelectricity cannot be met because the power plant is not built, existingpublic utility companies in the region would need to look elsewhere foran alternative supply of electricity to meet demand.The ERA has two alternative courses of action in processing Ocean State'sapplication to import natural gas. It may grant the application (with orwithout conditions) on deny the application. If the ERA denied the applicationand thereby prevented delivery of Canadian gas to the Ocean State plant,Ocean State would be required to secure alternative sources of fuel orto abandon the project, in which case other generating facilities wouldhave to be built to meet the demand. If the application is granted, OceanState may proceed with the project as proposed, subject to any conditionsimposed by the EFSB and the FERC. Since the FEIS concluded that the availablealternatives for meeting the electrical demand would cause impacts greaterthan, or comparable to, the Ocean State project, the ERA has concludedthat granting the import authorization is the environmentally preferredalternative.The FEIS also assessed a number of power plant site alternatives and pipelineroute alternatives. Decisions concerning these alternatives will be madeas part of the FERC and EFSB approval process. The ERA has examined theprojected impacts of these alternatives and has concluded that, regardlessof which are allowed, the resulting environmental impacts would be acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Basis For Decision</ITAG>The principal criteria in choosing whether to approve of disapprove a gasimport project is the requirement under section 3 of the NGA that an applicationto import gas must be approved unless, after opportunity for hearing, itis determined that the import is not consistent with the public interest.In addition, the environmental implications of granting or denying theimport application must be considered pursuant to NEPA.A. Order 243 and 243-AThe ERA is guided in making its determination by the DOE's natural gasimport policy guidelines (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Under this policy,the competitiveness of an import in the markets served in the primary considerationfor meeting the public interest test. In the case of long-term arrangementssuch as this, need for the gas supply and security of supply are also importantconsiderations.The ERA found that the import arrangement meets the DOE policy guidelines.The gas will be market-responsive because the purchase contract containsan automatic price adjustment mechanism, price renegotiation provisions,and no take-or-pay requirements. Since Ocean State would incur no take-or-payor minimum bill obligation in connection with this import, it is reasonableto assume that Ocean State will not take gas if it is not the most competitivelypriced supply available. Under the policy guidelines, need is presumedto be a function of competitiveness. Based on the marketability of gasunder the arrangement, the ERA therefore determined that there is a needfor the proposed import. With respect to security of supply, the ERA foundthat the import will not lead to any undue dependence on an unreliablesource of supply nor otherwise compromise the energy security of the nationover the 20-year term of the import proposal. Therefore, the ERA foundthat the proposed import would be consistent with the public interest.B. Environmental Determination The FERC was the lead Federal agency in conducting an examination of theenvironmental effects of constructing both the power plant and Tennessee'sadditional transmission facilities and preparing the Ocean State FEIS forthe project. Included in the FEIS were a discussion of the impacts of providingthe power by other means, and an evaluation of power plant site alternativesand pipeline route alternatives. The DOE participated as a cooperatingagency during the preparation of the FEIS, and the ERA relied on the FEIS(which was adopted as a DOE EIS) in assessing the environmental effectsof granting or denying the import authorization. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Power Generation </ITAG>If the required supply is provided by electric generating facilities thatuse oil, coal, or nuclear fission as fuel sources, substantial adverseenvironmental impacts could occur from that use, in contrast to the relativelyminor environmental impacts of the Ocean State project. Other alternativetypes of generation to the combined-cycle technology chosen by Ocean State,including fluidized bed combustion, gas turbines, and integrated gasification/combined-cyclewere found to be more costly and the environmental impacts greater, orcomparable to, the impacts from combined-cycle plants. Other technologiesusing renewable sources (hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal power)were judged to be technically limited for the geographic area, and thereforenot practicable. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Power Plant Location </ITAG>The FEIS evaluated two primary alternative sites for the power plant inaddition to Ocean State's proposed site at Sherman Farm Road in Burrillville,Rhode Island. Those sites were the Bryant College site in Smithfield, RhodeIsland, and the Ironstone site in nearby Uxbridge, Massachusetts. All arelocated within nine miles of one another. The Ironstone site was identifiedas the environmentally preferred alternative to the Sherman Farm Road sitewith regard to land use compatibility, wetland impacts, upland clearing,and buffer area. The FEIS concluded, however, that the overall differencesbetween Ocean State's proposed site and the two alternative sites was notsignificant, and with certain mitigating measures, construction and operationof the power plant at the Sherman Farm Road site would have a limited adverseenvironmental impact and would be environmentally acceptable. Althoughthe Ironstone site was the preferred alternative, the estimated cost differentialis $40 to $50 million greater for that site than for the Sherman Farm Roadsite, or about 15 percent of the present estimated capital cost for thepower plant. Five alternative routes replacing all or portions of the proposed alignmentof the oil and water pipelines to the Sherman Farm Road site were consideredin the FEIS. The environmentally preferred route consists of the OP-1,OP-4, and OP-5 alternatives. It would be preferrable to Ocean State's proposedroute because of the advantages of constructing both the oil and waterpipelines in the same trench. In addition, the proposed oil and water pipelineroute which follows primarily city streets and local highways would disrupttraffic during construction and affect residences along the roads. In contrast,the preferred route would mainly follow existing or abandoned railroadand electric transmission line rights-of-way, and would result in minimalimpact on road traffic residences, and wetlands, and minimize the lengthof pipeline required. An alternative to using an oil pipeline route would be to truck No. 2 fueloil to the power plan site. However, FEIS concluded that construction ofan oil pipeline would create significantly fewer and less severe socioeconomicand environmental impacts than transportation of the backup fuel by truck.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Gas Pipeline Improvements </ITAG>The FEIS determined that the proposed additions and upgrades to Tennessee'sexisting gas pipeline facilities, with certain mitigating measures, wouldhave a limited adverse environmental impact and would be environmentallyacceptable. In evaluating Tennessee's proposed new facilities the FEISexamined alignments and alternatives to two of the five proposed pipelineloop segments, Loops 5 and 7, located in Madison County, New York, andHampden County, Massachusetts, respectively, as well as several variationsor modifications to the proposed route for the Rhode Island Extension.No alternatives were proposed for the other new loop lines (Loops 1, 4,and 6). The Nelson Swamp bypass and the Southwick variation were consideredalternative routes for Loops 5 and 7 to avoid crossing a wetland and adensely developed commercial and residential area. Those alternatives,however, were not found to be significantly superior to the proposed route.The proposed route of the Rhode Island Extension passes through a numberof wetlands, crosses valuable sand and gravel resources, and bisects twoparcels of undeveloped residential property. Three route modificationsto the Extension that would avoid a major wetland, avoid impinging on thedevelopment potential and aesthetic quality of the private property, andminimize the amount of virgin right-of-way used for the pipeline, namelythe Sutton Forest Power Line (V-1M), Seaver (V-5), and Boston Edison Line(V-7) variations, were identified as environmentally preferable to theproposed route. An alternative proposed by Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin)for rerouting and delivering the imported gas through its existing pipeline,thereby eliminating the need to construct the Rhode Island Extension wasalso examined. The FEIS concluded that, absent all other considerations,the Algonquin alternative is environmentally preferable to Tennessee'sproposal. However, taking into account Tennessee's separate proposal tosupply Providence Gas Company (the Rhode Island Extension would be sizedto transport the Ocean State and Providence Gas Company volumes) whichis currently pending before the FERC in another proceeding and is the subjectof a separate environmental assessment, future deliveries of gas for thesecond combined-cycle unit, and gas transportation rates, the FERC staff'sanalysis indicates that there would be no environmental advantage to Algonquin'sproposal and it would require later construction of substantially morethan 11 miles of pipeline. The FEIS concluded that no significant impacts would occur as a resultof the proposed compressor station additions and construction of the newcompressor station. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Considerations In Implementing The Decision</ITAG>The FERD and EFSB have the principal authority and direct responsibilityto impose and monitor any mitigation conditions through their authorizations.In the FEIS, the FERC staff specified mitigation measures which it considersappropriate and reasonable for the construction and operation of the powerplant and the natural gas pipeline facilities. These additional mitigationmeasures would further reduce the anticipated environmental impacts. Withrespect to the measures for the natural gas pipeline, the FERC staff recommendedthat those measures be attached to any certificate issued by the FERC.With respect to the measures for the power plant, the FERC staff recommendedthat the FERC, through its authorization of the Tennessee pipeline facilities,require Ocean State to implement those measures, not imposed by the EFSBpermits.While it is uncertain which, if any, of the various recommendations/mitigationmeasures would be implemented or imposed as conditions to any authorizationsthe FERC and EFSB decide to issue, the ERA has determined that the impactsof constructing and operating both the power plant and the proposed Tennesseegas pipeline facilities would be environmentally acceptable under any ofthe alternative configurations assessed in the FEIS.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Conclusion</ITAG>The decision whether to authorize this import of natural gas has been evaluatedagainst the potential environmental impacts. The ERA has determined thatgranting Ocean State authority to import Canadian natural gas is the environmentallypreferred alternative to denying the authorization, and is not inconsistentwith the public interest under section 3 of the NGA.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, September 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Chandler L. van Orman,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Deputy Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-21461 Filed 9-19-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
