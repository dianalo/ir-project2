In effect, this international agreement and other relatedagreements obligated each of the Governments to adhere to the cross-waiverof liability and to extend the cross-waiver of liability to its contractorsand subcontractors, among other persons and entities, by contract or otherwise.This rule was published as an interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 8, 1988 (53 FR 45095). The singlepublic response did not require changes in the rule; however, several clarifyingeditorial changes were made in the interim rule. In 1852.228-76, paragraph(b)(4) of the clause, it was made clear that the Federal Republic of Germanyis a partner state. In paragraph (b)(6)(i), the conjunction ``and'' wasexpressly added at the end of the sentence to confirm that the relevantdefinition was comprised of both (b)(6) (i) and (ii). In addition, a definitionof ``Space Station'' for purposes of the cross-waiver previously containedin the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement signed on September 29,1988, and impliedly incorporated by reference to that Agreement in theinterim rule, is provided for in full in the new (b)(8). Finally, (j) wasamended, consistent with NASA practice, to authorize contractors to modifythis cross-waiver in subcontracts to reflect the relationship of the parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact </ITAG>The Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), by memorandum datedDecember 14, 1984, exempted certain agency procurement regulations fromExecutive Order 12291. This proposed regulation falls in this category.NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule does not impose any reporting or record-keepingrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1828 and 1852 </ITAG>Government procurement. <ITAG tagnum="6">S.J.
