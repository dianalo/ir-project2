Representatives of the banned United Democratic Front and theCongress of South African Trade Unions told a news conference thattheir affiliates in Natal share a commitment with the Zulupolitical organization, Inkatha, ``to a mass movement for peace.''   Crowds supporting the two sides fought in the Natal town ofMpophomeni Tuesday, killing five people and injuring five. Policefiring tear gas and birdshot broke up the battle and arrested 196people, authorities said.   Both sides agree the violence must stop, but previous peaceinitiatives have failed to halt the beatings, arson fires, andrevenge killings that occur almost daily in Zulu townships andvillages.   United Democratic Front spokesman Murphy Morobe, who is notrestricted from political activity even though his organization isbanned, said affiliated community groups in Natal had approved thepeace plan.   However, Morobe said he was wary of possible governmentinterference.   ``It would seem to us that when we are on the verge of a majorpolitical initiative to break through the cycle of violence, theapartheid state has moved systematically to undermine the politicalprocess we are engaged in,'' he said in a statement.   He referred to a speech Monday by Law and Order Minister AdriaanVlok that blamed front supporters for the violence. Vlok predictedthe peace efforts would fail and said church officials organizingthe initiative were naive.   The front is allied with the outlawed African National Congress.The ANC criticizes Inkatha's opposition to boycotts, sanctions andother confrontational methods of battling South Africa's policy ofracial segregation.</TEXT></DOC>
