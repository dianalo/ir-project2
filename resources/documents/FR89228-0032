To carryout the foregoing, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with licenseesand State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the developmentof State and local plans and preparedness to cope with radiological emergenciesat commercial nuclear power facilities. These activities are describedin 44 CFR Part 350, ``Review and Approval of State and Local RadiologicalEmergency Plans and Preparedness'' and Part 351, ``Radiological EmergencyPlanning and Preparedness,'' which sets out Federal agency roles and assignstasks for assisting State and local governments.In the event of an actual radiological emergency, the Federal RadiologicalEmergency Response Plan (FRERP) provides for the overall Federal supportto State and local governments for all types of radiological incidentsincluding those occurring at nuclear power plants. The FRERP was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 8, 1985 (50 CFR Part 46542).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>On November 18, 1988, the President issued Executive Order 12657 (53 FR47513) ``Federal Emergency Management Agency Assistance in Emergency PreparednessPlanning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants.''The Executive order was issued to ensure that adequate offsite radiologicalemergency planning and preparedness is in place at commercial nuclear powerplants to satisfy the emergency planning requirements of the NRC for theissuance or retention of operating licenses. The order applies to thosesituations where State and local governments, either individually or together,decline or fail to prepare commercial nuclear power plant radiologicalemergency preparedness plans that are sufficient to meet NRC licensingrequirements or to participate adequately in the preparation, demonstration,testing, exercise or use of such plans.As required by section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12657, ``[i]n carryingout any of its responsibilities under this order, FEMA * * * shall takecare not to supplant State and local resources. FEMA shall substitute itsown resources for those of the State and local governments only to theextent necessary to compensate for the nonparticipation or inadequate participationof those governments, and only as a last resort after appropriate consultationwith the Governors and responsible local officials in the affected arearegarding State and local participation.''Executive Order 12657 directs FEMA to undertake three basic functions ina ``decline or fail'' circumstance: (1) To assist the licensee in the developmentof an emergency response plan; (2) to participate in the testing and otheractivities designed to ensure that the plan can be effectively implementedin the event of an emergency; and (3) to prepare for and to undertake,if necessary, an operational role in responding to an emergency. An undertakingby FEMA of the first two of those functions is not dependent on a requestfrom State or local government officials. As recognized in this regulation(44 CFR 352.5(c)(2)), the ``realism doctrine'' assumes that in the eventof an actual radiological emergency State and local officials will maketheir best efforts to protect the public, including requesting Federalassistance if necessary. FEMA's operational function in the event of anemergency is premised on the ``realism doctrine.''Upon certification in writing to FEMA by a licensee of non-participationor inadequate participation by State or local governments, the Directorof FEMA is authorized to take actions to provide the appropriate Federalassistance.This regulation supports the amendments made to NRC's rule, 10 CFR 50.47(c)(1) and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F., effective December13, 1987, (52 FR 42078) for those situations where State or local governmentsdecline or fail to participate in radiological emergency planning and preparedness.In connection with nuclear power plant licensing, FEMA has previously enteredinto a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (50 FR 15485, April 18, 1985)with the NRC, under which FEMA will furnish assessments and findings anddeterminations as to whether or not offsite emergency plans and preparednessare adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacyand maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels andqualification and equipment adequacy). These assessments, findings anddeterminations will be used by the NRC in connection with its own licensingand regulatory responsibilities. FEMA will support these assessments, findingsand determinations in the NRC licensing process and related administrativeand court proceedings (See 10 CFR Part 50). FEMA's procedures for processing and making determinations on licenseecertification requests under this regulation are described as follows:Upon receipt of a licensee certification, FEMA will evaluate the certificationas to whether it meets the criteria of ``decline or fail'' as used in section1(a) of Executive Order 12657. Upon an affirmative determination, FEMAwill begin providing advice to the licensee. A separate FEMA evaluationwill focus on the licensee's request for Federal facilities and resources.If an affirmative determination is made that Federal facilities and resourcesare needed, then FEMA will initiate actions to provide these facilitiesand resources under Subpart B. During this process, FEMA will seek advicefrom the NRC as to whether or not the licensee has maximally utilized itsresources and the extent to which the licensee has complied with 10 CFR50.47(c)(1).This regulation also provides the framework for FEMA's review and evaluationof licensee offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness. Specifically,FEMA will conduct its review and evaluation activities under 44 CFR Part352 in a manner consistent with 44 CFR Part 350 to the extent those policiesand procedures are appropriate and not inconsistent with the intent ofExecutive Order 12657. Any apparent inconsistencies or incongruities betweenthe ``350 process'' and the review and evaluation under 44 CFR Part 352shall be resolved through the FEMA/NRC stering committee within the frameworkof the NRC/FEMA MOU.Federal policies and procedures for ensuring that plans and proceduresare in place to respond to radiological emergencies at commercial nuclearpower plants are covered by several existing documents. In addition tothe FEMA and NRC regulations, the NRC/FEMA MOU on planning and preparednessand the FRERP, these documents include: The joint FEMA/NRC ``Criteria forPreparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency Response Plans andPreparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants'' [NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1,Rev. 1. and Supp. 1] and the NRC/FEMA MOU for incident response. Exceptfor Supplement 1, these documents pertain to situations where State andlocal governments participate in radiological emergency planning and preparedness.Those policies and procedures pertain to situations in which State andlocal governments participate adequately in the emergency planning processand have produced response plans which meet NRC licensing requirements.In those instances, Federal agencies provide assistance directly to theState and local governments. Supp. 1 to NUREG-0654 applies to utility plansonly. This regulation identifies a mechanism for consulting with Federal agenciesas participants in the proceedings of the FRPCC and the RACs which wereestablished by 44 CFR Part 351. Such consultations address the best wayto apply Federal facilities and resources. The functions of the FRPCC andthe RACs are expanded to include providing advice to FEMA regarding provisionto and use of Federal technical assistance, facilities, and resources byaffected licensees. In the event of an actual radiological emergency, E.O. 12657 requires FEMAto take all steps necessary for ensuring the implementation of plans developedunder the order; and to coordinate the actions of other Federal agenciesin achieving maximum effectiveness of Federal efforts in responding tothe emergency. Planned response functions of Federal agencies are neededto ensure that the Federal government is prepared to assume any and allfunctions and undertakings necessary to provide adequate protection ofthe public in cases within the scope of this Executive order. In the eventof an actual emergency, FEMA will coordinate with the State and local governmentalauthorities and undertake offsite response functions as may be needed.FEMA will transfer such functions to State and local governments when theyexercise their authority and related response functions. The Executive order also requires FEMA to assume any necessary commandand control function, or to delegate it to another Federal agency, in theevent that no competent State and local authority is available to performsuch function. Federal planning for this contingency will be accommodatedin the next revision of the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan.The Executive order makes provision for FEMA, to the extent permitted bylaw, to obtain full reimbursement for services performed by FEMA or otherFederal agencies pursuant to E.O. 12657 from any affected licensee andfrom any affected, non-participating or inadequately participating Stateand local government. The policy and procedures for the reimbursement processwill be covered in a separate regulation to be published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. Section 6 of Executive Order 12657 states that FEMA shall issue interimand final directives and procedures implementing the order as expeditiouslyas is feasible, and in any event, shall issue interim directives and proceduresnot more than 90 days following the effective date of this order and shallissue final directives and procedures not more than 180 days followingthe effective date of this order which is November 18, 1988.In order to meet these deadlines, FEMA is issuing this regulation as aninterim rule with a request for public comment instead of issuing a proposedrule with request for comment followed by a final rule. Meeting executiveorder deadlines is considered good cause for not issuing the rules as aproposed rule with a sixty day comment period. In accordance with 44 CFR1.4 (c), (e) and (f), such notice and public procedure is omitted as impracticalor unnecessary. In lieu of this omission public comment is requested onthe interim rule and FEMA will conduct full rulemaking including reviewand action on the comments to the same extent as if this were a proposedrule. The assistance described in this Part is not Federal financial assistancedescribed in 44 CFR Part 4 and, thus, does not require use of the intergovernmentalreview procedure described therein.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Director has certified that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities. The rule places obligationsand burdens only on nuclear power plant licensees which are electric utilitycompanies dominant in their service areas. These licensees are not ``smallentities'' as set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act and do not meetthe small business size standards [set forth in Small Business Administrationregulations in 13 CFR Part 121.] A copy of the certification, and attendantmaterial is available for inspection and copying in the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="85">Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant EnvironmentalImpact.</ITAG>The Director has determined under the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969 and FEMA Regulation 44 CFR Part 10, ``Environmental Considerations''that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting thequality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statementis not required. In support of this finding, an environmental assessmenthas been prepared which is available for inspection and copying for a feein the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="85">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>This rule is not a major rule as the term is used in Executive Order 12291and implementing OMB guidance.
