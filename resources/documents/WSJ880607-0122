Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GE F WNEWS </CO><IN> TRA </IN><TEXT>   Penske Corp., a closely held transportation-services concern, said it will sever its joint truck-leasing venture with Hertz Corp. to form one with a unit of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co.    The new joint venture between Penske and GE Capital will have assets of about $1.5 billion and annual revenue of about $750 million, the two companies said. It will employ some 5,500 people, including substantially all employees of the current joint venture.    To enter the new venture, Red Bank, N.J.-based Penske said it will exercise its right to buy out Hertz's interest in the current joint venture, Hertz Penske Truck Leasing Inc., formed in 1982. The price of the buy-out wasn't disclosed.    Hertz Penske is the nation's second-largest truck leasing and rental concern, with a fleet of nearly 42,000 vehicles and 267 service facilities. Its sales in 1987 were about $545 million; earnings weren't disclosed.    Roger S. Penske, chairman of Penske Corp., will be chairman and chief executive officer of the new company, which hasn't yet been named. Penske also has other interests, including a joint venture with General Motors Corp. called Detroit Diesel Corp., auto dealerships in New York and California, and race tracks in Michigan and Ohio. It also sponsors the Penske Racing Team. Mr. Penske himself is a former race-car driver.    A spokesman for Penske Corp. and a spokeswoman for GE Capital wouldn't comment on whether GE Capital will immediately contribute money to the new venture and, if so, how much. Nor would they say how ownership in the venture is split. A spokesman for Hertz said he couldn't comment on any aspect of the transaction.    George V. Robertson, a securities analyst with Alex Brown andamp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore, said the recent change in the ownership of Hertz may have precipitated Mr. Penske's change of alliances. UAL Corp. recently sold Hertz in a leveraged buy-out to a group that includes Ford Motor Co. and several Hertz officers.    &quot;I don't think Penske wants anything to do with Ford. He's always been a GM guy,&quot; said Mr. Robertson. &quot;He uses GM engines in his race cars. And he's a big GM dealer.&quot;    John Kalmbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., offered a different theory. &quot;It was well known that Penske always intended to buy out Hertz if he could find a way to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;It's my understanding that Hertz Penske had a high debt level and high debt-service costs. As a result, profit margins were not terribly high.&quot;    The Penske spokesman said that Mr. Penske's ties with GM don't preclude relationships with other car companies. He said it's &quot;coincidental&quot; that Penske is cutting its ties to Hertz shortly after Ford acquired an ownership stake in Hertz. He declined to comment on the other observations by the two securities analysts.    Mr. Kalmbach speculated the new venture's profit margins could be 7% to 8%, rivaling those at Ryder System Inc., the industry's largest truck-rental concern. </TEXT></DOC>
