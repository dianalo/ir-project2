In following years steady and significant advanceshave been made in developing reliable processes for cell fabricationas well as in demonstrating performance levels. The structure of solidoxide fuel cells (SFCs) and the method of cell interconnection in stackshas been previously reported. During the past few years no changes incell geometry and basic operation were required, attesting to the soundprinciples of construction and operation. However, due to the inherentlydifferent methods of SOFC fabrication, as compared to other types offuel cells, much time and effort was directed toward developing reliablefabrication of uncommon refractory materials used as SOFC components.This work is continuing and involves considerable activity in basic materialsresearch as well as post-test analysis of cells. After demonstratingacceptable life performance in single cells (andgt; 1500 hours), the authorhad such confidence in materials, processing, and performance of individualSOFCs that he initiated a life test of three interconnected cells inSeptember of 1983. This paper describes the stack, its performance, testsequence, and the initial results of an ongoing post-test analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
