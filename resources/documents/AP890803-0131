White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued a short, writtenreaction about 45 minutes after the news from Lebanon that theterrorists were holding off their execution threat.   Fitzwater said: ``We regard this as an encouraging and hopefuldevelopment. But it still does not answer our continuing concernfor release of all hostages. We urge that all parties in the regionuse whatever influence they have to end the tragedy of hostagetaking and to release those remaining in captivity. And we expressour appreciation to all those who have been thus far trying tohelp.''   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said,``If it is true, it is a positive development that we welcome.''   ``Bush is pleased, but still concerned,'' Fitzwater said, addingthat the White House had no independent confirmation of the actions.   Asked if ships would be recalled from the region, he said, ``Iurge everyone to keep in mind, especially in regard to the ships,that we stil have a serious problem in the Middle East, we stillhave hostages and that we will review the situation, but I wouldnot expect any quick changes in our situation.''   He said Bush had talked to a dozen world leaders in the past twoor three days, including those from most of the countries in theMiddle East.   Asked if Bush had sensed the death threat would be suspended, hereplied, ``I don't think we had any signals from any of the headsof state.''   ``We continue to press for the release of all the hostages,'' hesaid.   Terrorists first gave Cicippio a four-hour reprieve in theirdeadline to kill him, then announced 45 minutes before the newdeadline that they had suspended his execution.   The latest statement from the kidnappers was delivered to aWestern news agency in Beirut, along with an instant photograph ofCicippio, looking into the camera with the trace of a smile on hisface.   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and stateswith whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, wedeclare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitutionwith an initiative,'' said the 14-line Arabic statement.   It demanded that Israel release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, aShiite Moslem cleric kidnapped Friday by Israeli commandos, as wellas Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. Lists ofthem are to be prepared later and presented to the Red Cross, itsaid.   Previously, the group had only demanded freedom for Obeid andtwo companions seized with him.   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise theinitiative will be considered canceled,'' said the handwrittenmessage. It did not say if the death sentence would then berestored.   Before that announcement, Fitzwater had given a guarded reactionto developments in the troubled region.   ``It's very difficult to express very much optimism when theystill have one hostage whose life is under threat and others whoare in captivity with no immediate prospects for relief,''Fitzwater said before the terrorists announced they had suspendedtheir deadline for executing Cicippio.   Asked about reports that Bush had decided to take militaryaction if Cicippio were killed, Fitzwater said no final decisionhas been made.   ``Obviously that would be a very grave situation and we would beprepared to deal with it as best we could and I would not precludeany option one way or another,'' he said.   He said Bush has made ``preliminary decisions ... of everykind.''   ``You may be assured that all of the foundation planning hasbeen done and consideration of every scenario has been taken and wewill pursue this to the best of our ability,'' Fitzwater said, buthe emphasized, ``The decision's not made 'til the decision ismade.''   Asked if the United States would hold Iran responsible ifCicippio were killed, he replied, ``We don't have definitiveinformation on who is holding the hostages or who is responsibleand therefore we can't offer judgments at this point.''   However, another administration official said Wednesday that aU.S. message relayed to Iran earlier through two channels had saidin substance, ``If anything happens to the hostages we hold youresponsible.'' That source spoke on condition of anonymity.   Fitzwater said the Bush administration was still pursuing everydiplomatic channel to defuse the crisis.   ``Clearly, the winds are swirling in the region in terms oftrying to secure their release and trying to influence theHezbollah and others who might hold these prisoners,'' saidFitzwater.   He reiterated that the president had no plans to hold a specialstrategy session with military and diplomatic advisers today, as hehad in previous days since the reported execution on Monday ofMarine Lt. Col. William Higgins.   A Pentagon spokesman said there had not been any unusual changesin the deployment of the 6th Fleet ships in the Mediterraneantoday. ``All units are conducting routine operations,'' said Lt.Col. Mel Sunden. The estimated 25 U.S. vessels deployed in theregion ``is usually what we have there,'' he said.   The terrorists released a videotape of Cicippio asking Israel tosave him by releasing the Moslem cleric.   The deadline extension, to 3 p.m. EDT, was announced in astatement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut along withthe 90-second videotaped appeal by Cicippio.   ``I appeal to each person having honor who can move to releaseSheik Abdul Karim Obeid ... Don't be late, because they (thecaptors) are very serious ...,'' said Cicippio, who appearedhaggard and distressed.   ``... So to help me move I demand from the American people,oblige Israel to release ... Obeid immediately because hiskidnapping is not human.''   The presidential spokesman said, ``We of course do not have anydefinitive knowledge as to why they extended the deadline. We hopeit's because they have been swayed by world opinion and pressurefrom others that this was not appropriate behavior.   ``In one way, it's simply a testament to the cruelty of thesituation that you keep having these deadlines extended. Thereshouldn't be any deadlines at all,'' he said.   Fitzwater, asked whether the United States was consideringseeking the extradition of Obeid from Israel for possibleinvolvement in the kidnapping of Higgins, said ``the JusticeDepartment, I am told, is looking into the case.''   A federal law enforcement source, asking not to be identified,told The Associated Press, ``The FBI is investigating the murder ofHiggins as a possible violation'' of a 1986 anti-terrorist act.   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh declined comment on whetherhe would seek to extradite Obeid.</TEXT></DOC>
