Alan Dixon stood up during Senatedebate on amendments to the Clean Air Act last week andcomplained: &quot;No one here knows how much this bill willultimately cost business in America.&quot;   The Illinois Democrat might have added that no oneprecisely knows the positive effects of the bill, much lesshow to put a dollar value on them.</LP><TEXT>   Strange as that sounds, Congress has spent far more timedebating costs and benefits than it did when it passed theoriginal Clean Air Act 20 years ago. &quot;Back then, it was alittle unseemly to even ask,&quot; says Paul Portney, a formerCarter administration environmental official now at Resourcesfor the Future, a Washington think tank.   But legislation in the 1990s demands cost-benefit analysis-- or at least the attempt. All the cost figures being tossedaround, including those in the accompanying chart, areactually educated guesses that rely on assumptions abouttechnology, business behavior and science that are certain tochange over the next decade.   As spongy as the cost estimates are, they're much morereliable than the best estimates of the benefits. Scientistsdon't agree on how much harm is done by acid rain, forinstance, and they don't know how much long-term harm iscaused lungs by smog in Los Angeles. So it's impossible foreconomists to assign dollar values to the benefits ofcontrolling or reversing the problem. And then there is thealways-tough question: How much is it worth to save one humanlife?   By any measure, the bill that went before the Senate iscostly. The Bush administration figures it will cost about$21.5 billion a year by 2005, when it's fully implemented.That's about $90 a year for every current resident of theU.S., or roughly the value of all the goods and servicesproduced in the United States in 1 1/2 days.   Some business groups say the cost will be far higher. Theadministration itself warns that its cost could rise as muchas $10 billion a year if stricter auto-tailpipe controls inthe Senate bill are triggered in the year 2001. Someenvironmental groups say the total cost is far less.   Mr. Portney, whose group tries to remain nonpartisan inthis debate, figures the cost at between $25 billion or $30billion. He thinks the administration may be low-balling itsestimates to defend the compromise it reached with theSenate. But he adds that costs are likely to fall becauseindustry will have an incentive to figure out cheaper ways tomeet the targets set in the bill.   &quot;The administration tried very hard to make sure thatcost-minimizing methods were used to achieve cleaner air,&quot;says Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of EconomicAdvisers. &quot;This is a shift in environmental regulation fromthe '70s, but there were a number of features, especially ofthe original Senate bill, which blatantly disregarded anysense of balancing the benefits of a healthier environmentwith the cost of lost jobs and higher utility bills.&quot;   With the figures so rough, no one is taking a position onthe Clean Air bill based strictly on an objective weighing ofcosts vs. benefits. Even economists who like such an approachsay they don't have enough information.   Although controversy persists about how much harm acidrain is doing, the one element of the bill that draws themost criticism from economists is the tougher restrictions itwould impose on release of toxic chemicals. &quot;We could make amuch bigger dent in annual cancer mortality . . . if we spentthat money elsewhere,&quot; says Mr. Portney. &quot;One example: radonin people's homes.&quot;   In the end, he notes, politicians -- not economists -- maybe the best judges of what Americans are willing to pay forcleaner air. &quot;It could be that in economists' attempts toestimate the benefits associated with these things, we don'tappreciate the high values that people attach to such thingsas preserving human health, improving visibility andprotecting the ecosystem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
