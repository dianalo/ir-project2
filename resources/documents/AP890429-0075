SouthAfrica denied the report.   In a dispatch from the town of Ressano Garcia, reporter CassimoGinabay of the AIM news agency said, ``Townspeople unanimouslyagree that there was South African involvement in the attack.''   The rampage, which included looting, burning of cars and killingof livestock, began at 10:30 p.m. Thursday and ended nearly fivehours later, AIM said.   The town is across the border from Komatipoort, South Africa,where Mozambique and South Africa signed a pact in 1984 agreeingnot to support guerrillas operating in each other's territory.   Both sides have claimed violations, but relations between thetwo countries have improved over the past few months. South Africahas even given aid to help the Mozambican army protect thecountry's power pylons from attack by the rebel Mozambican NationalResistance.   The Resistance has been fighting since 1977 to topple theMarxist-oriented government. It denies reports that it attacksMozambican civilians.   South African government officials say no official support nowgoes to the guerrillas. But AIM continues to carry reports thatSouth African military equipment and soldiers are used to supplythe guerrillas or to aid them in operations.   AIM quoted Lucas Chirute, owner of a local disco, as saying thatthe attackers were unloaded from a South African army vehicle. ``Isaw at least 15 bandits get out of the vehicle,'' he said.   The AIM report quoted another witness, who was not identified,as saying that during the attack, South African soldiers shone hugesearchlights on a supermarket being looted.   ``They lit up the area around the Foreign Exchange Store, fromwhich the bandits stole most of the food,'' the person was quotedas saying. AIM said the same source reported that South Africansoldiers shot at people who were running toward the South Africanside of the border. It said at least 200 residents fled into SouthAfrica.   A spokesman for South Africa's military said 147 refugees fledinto Mozambique late Thurdsay and early Friday after heavy gunfirewas heard coming from the direction of Mozambique.   ``These facts obviously make nonsense of AIM's claims'' thatSouth African forces participated in the attack, the spokesman said.   AIM quoted local administrator Domingos Durbeque as saying 250guerrillas, divided into three groups, attacked the town, mainlytargeting the military headquarters, the border guard post and theForeign Exchange Store.   AIM said six miners, returning to visit their families afterworking in South Africa, were killed, as well as a woman.   AIM said the guerrillas stole or burned the belongings of morethan 20 miners waiting to catch a train; dynamited and set fire tofour locomotives valued at $6 million; burned seven vehicles;destroyed the town's immigration post; shot cattle in a corral; andkidnapped an unknown number of people who were forced to carry awaythe looted food and clothing.</TEXT></DOC>
