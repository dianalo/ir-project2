The September contract for the benchmark U.S. crude oil, WestTexas Intermediate, rose 34 cents to close at $16.39 a barrelThursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

But there were no new developments to influence tradingThursday, said Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.andamp;F. ManInternational Futures Inc.   ``You're having a technical correction to a bear market,''Fiedler said.   Most traders are bullish for the short-term because of theprospect of peace in the Persian Gulf, Fiedler said. They believean end to the 8-year-old war will remove the threat of oil suppliesbeing interrupted by the hostilities.   But in the long-term, Fiedler said, many traders are bearishbecause both countries could step up oil production _ adding to theglut on worldwide markets _ as they try to repair their economiesfollowing the war.   Fiedler described the market as nervous in advance of a possibleAug. 3 meeting of officials of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to discuss pricing and production levels.</TEXT></DOC>
