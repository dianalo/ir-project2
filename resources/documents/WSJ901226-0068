Ifit is true, as Mr. Milken has repeatedly contended, that hedid his business in a legal manner for the most part, then hewill have very little to offer the government, and his10-year sentence will probably stand. But if he was involvedin criminal activity on a large scale, then he can name a lotof names, tell about a lot of deals -- and he will probablyget a significant sentence reduction.   Sound ridiculous? Welcome to the real world of federalcriminal law.</LP><TEXT>   It's usually, but not always, a drug case.   Congress said it wanted to be sure that drug &quot;kingpins&quot;got long prison sentences, so it legislated severe mandatoryminimum sentences for drug-distribution offenses. They can befive, 10 or 20 years, depending primarily upon the amount ofthe drug involved. There is less than two months a yeargood-time credit allowed with these sentences.   The only way you can be sentenced to less than themandatory minimum is by giving the government &quot;substantialassistance in the investigation or prosecution of otherpersons.&quot;   It does not matter that you are a mother with a previouslyclean record and with young children who need you. The motherwill get the mandatory minimum sentence. So will a father whohas been supporting by his hard work a large family for 20years. So will a college student who was helping a friend andwho had no idea of the seriousness of what he was doing.Since they are not really involved in the drug underworld,they cannot help themselves by offering information about theillegal activities of others.   But if you are a serious, long-term drug dealer with manyassociates and former associates with whom you have donedozens or hundreds of deals, you can get your sentencereduced. You may not have to do any time at all. If you areespecially charming and manipulative, the government will payyou to get the mother or the father or the college studentinvolved in drug trafficking, and, if you are successful,that person will get the mandatory minimum sentence. The lawallows the kingpin to walk, and gives unconscionable prisonsentences to poor shleps who made one bad decision in theirlives.   Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about innocent peoplehere. I'm talking about people who have been convicted ofdrug-trafficking offenses.   Like the woman in Texas with five children. She drove avan into Mexico and was arrested at the border when she wasreturning home. She said she had no idea there was cocaine inher van; she said the van belonged to a boyfriend. The jurydidn't believe her. They convicted her, and she got the10-year mandatory minimum sentence. She was what we call a&quot;mule.&quot; She didn't know about any significant drug activity,so she couldn't make a deal with the government. What littleshe did know, she was afraid to tell.   In another case the main prosecution witness had threedrug-sales convictions. Whenever he was caught, he decided tocooperate. After a large amount of marijuana was found when asearch warrant was executed at his home, he decided tocooperate again. The government didn't even file chargesagainst him. The defendant whom he set up -- the snitch wascareful to make it legal so there would be no dismissal onthe grounds of entrapment -- had a previous record of onlydrunken driving. The defendant is now in jail for 15 years.The government informant is still on the street, probablystill getting paid by you and me.   Mr. Milken's dilemma surfaces every day in federal courtsnationwide. The American Lawyer magazine says there are&quot;hundreds of peripheral players in other people's drug deals&quot;now serving long mandatory minimum prison terms.   My clients are poor. Nobody knows who they are, excepttheir families and friends. This newspaper doesn't writeeditorials on their behalf. Growing up, nobody ever told themthat the best chance you have for a light sentence is to beheavily involved in crime.   Mr. Milken has the best legal advice money can buy. Still,I doubt that his family ever dreamed there would come a timewhen they'd be hoping and praying that their Michael was amuch bigger crook than they had thought, so he could get abig reduction in his sentence.   ---   Mr. Hellerstein is an assistant federal public defender inSan Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
