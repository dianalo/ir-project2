The new cadre is reducing costs by trimming personnel. Market veterans call that the easy way out and fault the Americans for avoiding the harder task of finding new ways to make money.    &quot;These guys are being sent in by head offices to get international operations that were out of control under control,&quot; says Hans-Joerg Rudloff, deputy chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., an international investment bank. &quot;But the ones cleaning up now are not the ones who will build for the future. For that, you need vision and experience.&quot;    Chemical New York Corp.'s Chemical Bank unit, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Citicorp and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. are among the U.S. firms that have sent senior operating executives to London in recent months. Call them hatchet men, belt-tighteners or restructurers, they are deflating once-ballooning costs in London. Their arrival reflects Wall Street's hope to exert more control over their operations here, which expanded rapidly during the bull market and the opening of London's exchanges to greater competition.    So far, the new arrivals have slashed 2,000 jobs, with more cuts expected. Citicorp, which eliminated 85 jobs, or about 4% of its London securities unit in January, plans to close two branches in England and abandon an attempt to break into the U.K. small-business banking market. Shearson has cut the number of U.K. securities in which it makes markets, and Chemical has reduced its presence in the $650 billion Euromarkets by trimming staff.    The turmoil, meanwhile, also is evident at some British banks. National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's biggest, yesterday gave Terry Green, deputy group chief executive, the additional post of chief executive of its troubled securities unit, County NatWest Group, following the resignations of the unit's chairman, Charles Villiers, and its chief executive, Jonathan Cohen. Mr. Green is likely to tighten management controls at the unit, which has been plagued by losses.    Some observers, however, doubt that Wall Street's tightened grip on London will make much difference if the firms don't find ways to boost revenue. Financial institutions &quot;should be asking themselves, 'What are we really doing in London?'&quot; says Alan W. Morgan, a principal at management consultants McKinsey andamp; Co.    He thinks many belt-tighteners aren't tackling the problem of selecting core growth areas. &quot;If you don't identify the businesses you want to be in, you are simply chasing profits on the way down,&quot; Mr. Morgan says. Due to the market crash and dwindling trading volume, firms here can't afford to be in businesses where they lack a competitive edge, he adds.    Charles McVeigh, chairman of Salomon Brothers International Ltd., a unit of Salomon Inc., agrees. Current cost-cutting efforts such as limiting overtime are important, he says, but they're &quot;skimming icing off the cake.&quot; The more important issue &quot;is what the cake looks like.&quot;    How U.S. institutions fare in London is increasingly important because of the possible abolition of the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts commercial banks' dealings in U.S. securities. In London, American banks already engage in securities businesses they can't enter in the U.S.    Earlier this month, the U.S. General Accounting Office said that the U.K. securities units of six U.S. banks received &quot;less than satisfactory&quot; performance ratings from U.S. regulators. The government agency didn't identify the institutions.    Chemical's belt-tightener, Janharm Musters, believes &quot;the old concept of international banking is dead.&quot; Chemical's effort to be a global financial supermarket proved too costly and ran into too much competition.    At Mr. Musters's urging, Chemical is reducing its banking units in Spain and France, and will handle more business from New York. He also is beefing up Chemical's more profitable foreign exchange and short-term debt trading operations, and may expand its fund management and leveraged-buyout businesses.    If Chemical's new strategy can work in London, &quot;we can make it work in the U.S. after Glass-Steagall,&quot; Mr. Musters says. But what happens if Chemical and other U.S. financial houses can't boost their profits here? He thinks the same fate awaits them as befell the chemicals, steel and paper industries: &quot;You get taken over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
