Ricardo Alvarenga made the statement Monday, a day after a rebelcommander interviewed in this town said the guerrillas are on theverge of a new offensive in the country's nine-year civil war.   Prospects for peace had dramatically brightened then dimmed afterJan. 24, when the guerrillas offered to participate in thepresidential vote and respect its outcome if given six extra monthsto prepare and guaranteed security. The rebels boycotted all fiveprevious national elections this decade as shams.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte has proposed a six-week delay ofthe vote, but rebels dismissed it as inadequate.   The military called a three-month unilateral cease-fire last weekand urged the rebels to do the same.   But Diego, a top officer of the rebels' Popular LiberationForces, said Sunday that, ``We are ready to escalate the war.'' Hisforce is one of five guerrilla factions united in the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front.   ``To say we will (escalate the war), then not do it, would bestupid both militarily and politically. So you can be sure we'll doit,'' he said, sitting on a bench in a classroom off the main squareof Las Vueltas, a rebel-dominated town in the northern province ofChalatenango. Diego is a nom de guerre.   Over his shoulder was slung a Soviet-designed AK-47 assaultrifle, one of several hundred Diego said his group bought indirectlythis year from U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras.   ``The AKs are part of the military leap we're preparing,'' Diegosaid. ``It is more potent in terms of firepower. It makes its userfeel more powerful, while contributing to the demoralization of theenemy.''   Salvadoran rebel chiefs said last year they were acquiring armsindirectly from the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. But AK-47s, thestandard Contra weapon, have never been so evident among Salvadoranguerrillas as during the past few weeks.   Contra leaders deny their forces, which have been mostly idlesince Washington cut off military aid 13 months ago, are sellingweapons. El Salvador's military high command contends Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista government is giving AK-47s to the rebels.   Several reports say the weapon may already be in the hands of upto 10 percent of the estimated 7,000 rebel fighters.   Diego did not say when the offensive might begin.   On Monday, Alvarenga said the constitution blocks any change inthe date of elections.   ``Just like they (the guerrillas) do not accept the March 19 datefor whatever reasons, we do not accept any change in the date,because constitutionally the date cannot be changed,'' he toldreporters at the National Assembly.   On Saturday, the rebels repeated their charge that theU.S.-backed government was procrastinating and proposed direct talksthis week in San Salvador, the capital.   The single-chamber legislature, controlled by the rightistRepublican Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, has virtual veto powerover any postponement.   ARENA, of which Alvarenga is a leader, is favored to win thepresidency in next week's election.   The constitution says the election must be held at least twomonths before a new government takes office. Duarte's term ends onJune 1.   Leaders of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party have saidelections could be legally postponed and an interim president namedby the legislature if a political consensus existed to do so.   The civil war has claimed the lives of about 70,000 people, mostof them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
