The power system is then decomposed into two groupscomprising run-of-river and storage plants. The total power output ofrun-of-river plants has been treated as a negative load in arriving atthe system demand, with the nonlinear programming method used to determinethe optimal division of discharge between turbines in a run-of-riverstation, if necessary. For the storage plants, which represent the bulkof the available generation for the tested system used, the non-linearprogramming method has been used to test three different operating objectives,namely, the minimisation of the total utilisation of water, best turbineefficiency and minimum active power loss in the electrical network. Theelectrical network has been incorporated by the use of a fast decoupledload flow, with sensitivity methods used to handle violations of theelectrical network constraints.</TEXT></DOC>
