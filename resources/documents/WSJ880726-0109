We thought it was thrilling, too, though perhaps not as stirring as when Hulk Hogan entered Madison Square Garden carrying an American flag for a match with Nikolai Volkov with &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; pounding out of the speakers. We have no particular objection if Mr. Dukakis wants to bring MTV to American politics. If Mr. Dukakis gets the urge to move around during &quot;Coming to America,&quot; a Greek dance might be a tad slow, but we're certain Van Halen would be happy to teach the Governor how to sail across a stage. </TEXT></DOC>
