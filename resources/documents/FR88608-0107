The Guidelines areintended to advise the business community, the legal profession, and interestedmembers of the public of the general legal and economic analysis undertakenby the Department in making prosecutorial decisions under the antitrustlaws regarding international business conduct. The Department will applythe general analysis reflected in the Guidelines reasonably and flexiblyto particular facts and circumstances. The Guidelines should not be understoodto affect any other considerations relevant to the exercise of prosecutorialdiscretion by the Department of Justice. The Guidelines are not intended to create or recognize any legally enforceableright in any person. They are not intended to affect the admissibilityof evidence or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conductof litigation. Moreover, changes in the relevant statutory framework, legalprecedent, and methods of internal Department analysis may occur over time.Because these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendmentsto the Guidelines, the positions stated in the Guidelines should not beregarded as affecting any future action which may be appropriate underthe antitrust laws. Parties seeking to know the Department's specific enforcementintentions with respect to any particular transaction should consider seekinga Business Review pursuant to 28 CFR 50.6. The draft Guidelines are not subject to the notice and comment or the otherrequirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, but the Department welcomesthe views of the business and legal communities and of the general publicon all matters which are or might appropriately and beneficially be addressedin the Guidelines.

Introduction </ITAG>The U.S. antitrust laws represent the legal embodiment of our nation'scommitment to a free market economy. The competitive process of the freemarket ensures the most efficient allocation of resources and the maximizationof consumer welfare. Similarly, international markets unimpeded by privateand governmentally imposed barriers to trade ensure the production of goodsbased on the comparative advantages of all producers. The Department of Justice (the ``Department'') focuses its antitrust enforcementefforts on anticompetitive conduct that affects U.S. consumer welfare.To be effective, of course, U.S. antitrust enforcement must reach someconduct that occurs outside the United States and that involves foreignactors. For example, an international cartel of private producers cannotimpose higher prices on U.S. consumers with impunity simply by holdingits cartel meetings outside the United States. On the other hand, U.S.antitrust enforcement does not reach conduct that has only a remote effecton U.S. consumer welfare. To justify the exercise of the Department's enforcementauthority, conduct must have a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeableanticompetitive effect on U.S. commerce. In addition, in some cases, considerationsof international comity may require the Department to consider the significantinterests of other nations that may also have jurisdiction over transnationalconduct in determining whether to challenge that conduct. These Guidelines are intended to provide practical guidance concerningthe Department's internal antitrust enforcement policies and proceduresas they apply in a variety of international contexts. The remainder ofPart I of these Guidelines describes the most relevant applicable antitrustlaws enforced by the Department; the legal and economic analysis the Departmentemploys in assessing certain types of business conduct under those lawsfor enforcement purposes; the jurisdictional rules that govern the Department'senforcement policy; considerations of international comity that may affectthe Department's discretion in asserting jurisdiction in a particular case;circumstances under which the existence of foreign sovereign compulsionmay lead the Department not to prosecute anticompetitive conduct; and theanalysis the Department employs in assessing certain antitrust issues thatmay arise in the context of international ``trade frictions'' or disputesunder the U.S. trade laws. Part II of these Guidelines consists of seventeenhypothetical cases that illustrate the enforcement policies described inPart I. These Guidelines are intended only to provide general guidance as to howthe Department analyzes certain commonly occurring issues affecting itsown enforcement decisions. Several important caveats therefore apply touse of the Guidelines. First, these Guidelines should not be taken as expressingany view regarding the applicability of the laws of other nations.\1\<NOTE/> American businesses engaged in or contemplating transactionswith foreign partners or activities abroad should consider the applicabilityof foreign laws relating  to business activities affecting commerce inthose nations. Second, these Guidelines are not intended to substitutefor the advice of experienced private antitrust counsel or for formal guidanceunder the Department's Business Review procedure.\2\<NOTE/> Third, although the Department believes that the analysisstated in these Guidelines is economically and legally correct and consistentwith the trend in the courts, these Guidelines are not intended to be arestatement of the law. In addition, readers should also separately evaluatethe risk of private litigation by competitors, consumers, and suppliers,as well as the risk of enforcement by state prosecutors under state andfederal antitrust laws. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The U.S. government is a party to voluntary guidelinesthat discourage participation by international business enterprises (includingU.S. businesses) in anticompetitive trade practices. <T3>See </T3>Code of Conduct for Multinational Enterprises adopted by theCouncil of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (June1976).

In addition, theJustice Department has been and will continue to be engaged in effortsto achieve international liberalization of trade policies where legitimatepublic goals can be served through less restrictive measures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 28 CFR 50.6.  A. Applicable Antitrust Laws Enforced bythe Department The following is a brief summary of antitrust laws enforced by the Departmentthat are likely to have the greatest significance in planning internationalbusiness transactions.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') may also proceedin a civil action under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (``FTCAct'') (15 U.S.C. 41-57c) against conduct that violates the Sherman andClayton Acts. The FTC also has exclusive authority to enforce the FTC Act'sprohibition against ``unfair methods of competition'' and ``unfair or deceptiveacts or practices.'' 15 U.S.C. 45. In addition, historically, the FTC,rather than the Department, has enforced the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.13-13c, 21. Only the Department, however, is authorized to prosecute criminalviolations of the antitrust laws.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Sherman Act </ITAG>Section 1 of the Sherman Act sets forth the basic antitrust prohibitionagainst contracts, combinations, or conspiracies ``in restraint of tradeor commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.'' \4\<NOTE/> Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization, attemptsto monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize ``any part of trade or commerceamong the several States, or with foreign nations.'' \5\<NOTE/> Section 6a defines the jurisdictional reach of the ShermanAct with respect to non-import foreign commerce.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 1 (1982). The Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. 8-11(1982), which essentially parallels and is coextensive with section 1 ofthe Sherman Act, specifically prohibits conspiracies in restraint of U.S.import trade. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 15 U.S.C. 2 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 15 U.S.C. 7 (1982). <T3>See</T3> discussion at I.C.1., <T3>infra </T3>Violations of the Sherman Act may be prosecuted as civil or criminal violations,depending on the circumstances.\7\<NOTE/> Criminal violations of the Sherman Act are punishable byfines and imprisonment. The Sherman Act provides that corporate defendantsmay be fined up to $1 million and individual defendants may be fined upto $100,000 and sentenced to up to three years of imprisonment. Under theCriminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984 \8\<NOTE/> and the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\9\<NOTE/> however, for felony violations continuing or committed afterDecember 31, 1984, a corporate defendant may be fined up to $1 million,twice the gross pecuniary loss by victims, or twice the corporation's grosspecuniary gain from the violation, whichever is greatest. An individualdefendant may be fined up to $250,000, twice the gross pecuniary loss byvictims, or twice the defendant's gross pecuniary gain from the violation,whichever is greatest.\10\<NOTE/> For antitrust felony violations committed or continuing onor after November 1, 1987, the U.S. Sentencing Commission's SentencingGuidelines \11\<NOTE/> require convicted corporate defendants to be fined a minimumof $100,000 and require convicted individuals to be fined a minimum of$20,000. The Sentencing Guidelines also generally require individuals toserve a minimum of four months in jail (with probationary provisions).\1\\2\<NOTE/> In a civil proceeding, the Department may obtain injunctiverelief \13\<NOTE/> or actual damages for injury incurred by the U.S. governmentas the purchaser of goods or services as a result of a violation.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>discussion at I.B.1., <T3>infra, </T3>concerning when conduct that violates the Sherman Act willbe subject to criminal prosecution by the Department.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Pub.

Export Trading Company Act of 1982 </ITAG>Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (the ``ETC Act'') \32\<NOTE/> enables any person engaged in U.S. export trade to obtainan export trade certificate of review. Such a certificate confers immunityfrom suit under state and federal antitrust laws for activities that arespecified in and comply with the certificate. The Secretary of Commerceissues the certificate with the concurrence of the Attorney General. Toobtain a certificate, an applicant must show that proposed export conduct:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ 15 U.S.C. 4011-4021.  (1) Will result in neither a substantial lessening of competition or restraintof trade within the United States nor a substantial restraint of the exporttrade of any competitor of the applicant; (2) Will not unreasonably enhance, stabilize, or depress prices in theUnited States of the class of goods or services covered by the application;(3) Will not constitute unfair methods of competition against competitorsengaged in the export of the class of goods or services exported by theapplicant; and (4) Will not include any act that may reasonably be expected to resultin the sale for consumption or resale in the United States of such goodsor services.\33\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 4013(a). Although an export trade certificate of review provides significant protectionunder the antitrust laws, it has important limitations. A certificate providesno protection to persons that are not identified as an applicant or asa member of an applicant. Conduct that falls outside the scope of a certificateor that violates the terms of the certificate remains fully subject tocriminal sanctions as well as to private and governmental civil enforcementactions. A certificate that is obtained by fraud is void from the outsetand thus offers no protection under the antitrust laws. And, finally, acertificate confers no protection from prosecution under foreign laws.The Secretary of Commerce may revoke or modify a certificate if the Secretaryor the Attorney General determines that the applicants' export activitieshave ceased to comply with the four statutory criteria described above.\34\<NOTE/> The Attorney General may also bring suit under section 15of the Clayton Act ``to enjoin conduct threatening a clear and irreparableharm to the national interest.'' \35\<NOTE/> In addition, the ETC Act creates a private cause of actionfor injunctive relief and actual damages for individuals injured by exportconduct that does not comply with the statutory criteria.\36\<NOTE/> In any such private action,  certificated conduct is presumedto be valid.\37\<NOTE/> The prevailing party is entitled to costs and attorneys'fees.\38\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ 15 U.S.C. 4014(b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ 15 U.S.C. 4016(b)(5). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ 15 U.S.C. 4016(b)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ 15 U.S.C. 4016(b)(3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ 15 U.S.C. 4016(b)(1), (b)(4).  The Commerce Department, in consultation with the Justice Department, hasissued guidelines setting forth the standards for reviewing applicationsfor export trade certificates of review.\39\<NOTE/> Those guidelines contain several examples illustrating applicationof the certification standards to specific conduct in export trade, includingvertical restraints, horizontal restraints, and technology licensing arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>See </T3>Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration,Guidelines for the Issuance of Export Trade Certificates of Review (2ded.), 50 FR 1786 (Jan. 11, 1985) (hereinafter cited as ``ETC Guidelines'').B.Enforcement Policy The Department focuses its antitrust enforcement efforts against privaterestraints of trade that reduce U.S. consumer welfare by artificially restrictingoutput and/or raising prices. The Department is not concerned with conductthat solely affects competition in foreign markets and could have no direct,substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on competition and consumersin the United States. Nor is the Department concerned with the export conductof U.S. firms except where that conduct has a direct, substantial, andreasonably foreseeable anticompetitive effect on price and/or output inthe United States \40\<NOTE/> or where the U.S. government is the purchaser, or substantiallyfunds the purchase, of affected goods or services.\41\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Under special circumstances, the export conduct of U.S.firms conceivably could have such an effect_for example, where domesticcompetitors accounting for a substantial share of a market in which entryby new firms would be difficult and in which total supply (for both foreignand domestic markets) is fixed (or very inelastic) agreed on the levelof their exports in order to reduce supply and raise prices in the UnitedStates. Such an effect might also result if conduct that ostensibly involvesexports is actually designed to affect the price of products that are tobe resold in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Where the U.S. government substantially funds the purchaseof goods and services by a foreign government, the effect of anticompetitiveconduct with respect to the sale of those goods or services falls not onlyon the foreign government which is the nominal purchaser, but also (andprimarily) on American taxpayers who are the consumers of the philanthropicbenefits of the funding and who are deprived of the benefits of competitionguaranteed by the federal antitrust laws. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>United States v. Standard Tallow Corp., 1988-1 TradeCas. (CCH) andpara; 67,913 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (consent decree) (barring suppliersfrom fixing prices or rigging bids for the sale of tallow financed in wholeor in part through grants or loans by the U.S. government); United Statesv. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199 (1968); United Statesv. Anthracite Export Ass'n, Civ. No. 9171 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 1970) (consentdecree). Unlike many of the legal rules businesses encounter in their internationaldealings, the U.S. antitrust laws do not provide a checklist of detailedregulatory requirements. Instead, they establish competitive principlesthat have served as the basis for a system of flexible court-made rulesgoverning the competitive activities of businesses affecting U.S. commerce.\42\<NOTE/> Certain well-developed principles and rules, discussed andillustrated in these Guidelines, have evolved to guide business conductunder those laws. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ ``The Sherman Act was designed to be a comprehensivecharter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competitionas the rule of trade. It rests on the premise that the unrestrained interactionof competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources,the lowest prices, the highest quality and greatest material progress,while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservationof our democratic political and social institutions. But even when thepremise is open to question, the policy unequivocally laid down by theAct is Competition.'' Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S.1, 4-5 (1958). Despite the literal terms of section 1 of the Sherman Act, which condemns``[e]very contract [or] combination * * * in restraint of trade,'' it haslong been recognized that section l prohibits only unreasonable restraintsof trade. Almost all productive activity involves cooperation among personsand firms and some ancillary restrictions affecting their independent commercialdecision-making that literally can be said to restrain trade. The courts,however, have recognized that cooperative activity more often than notincreases productive efficiency and therefore benefits consumer welfare.\43\<NOTE/> The Department views as ``unreasonable'' (and therefore illegalunder section 1) only restraints of trade that would create or facilitatethe exercise of market power_that is, the power significantly to restrictoutput and/or to raise (or depress) price in a relevant market for a nontransitoryperiod of time_where the risk of anticompetitive behavior is not outweighedby efficiencies that would bring about a net increase in consumer welfare.\44\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>See. e.g., </T3>Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.,No. 85-1910, 56 U.S.L.W. 4387 (U.S. May 2, 1988) (hereinafter cited as``Sharp''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ When a firm or a combination of firms is able artificiallyto restrict output and maintain price above a competitive level, the resultis a transfer of wealth from buyers to sellers and a misallocation of society'sresources. The exercise of market power by buyers has wealth transfer andresource misallocation effects analogous to those associated with the exerciseof market power by sellers.``Naked'' restraints of trade which have no significant economic potentialother than to restrict price and/or output in a market are so inherentlyanticompetitive that they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.They are therefore condemned under the antitrust laws without inquiry intothe precise harm they have caused.\45\<NOTE/> The most common examples of such naked restraints are price-fixingand bid-rigging schemes among competitors. Such restraints are often prosecutedas criminal violations under the Sherman Act.\46\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Broadcast Music, Inc. v.

First, would the restraint reduce competition in a relevant marketby creating or facilitating the exercise of market power_that is, the powerto restrict output and/or raise (or depress) price? A number of marketconditions are relevant to answering this question. For example, if thereare many competitors that are not parties to the restraint, or if entryinto the relevant market is easy, then any attempt to exercise market powerby the parties to the restraint would be frustrated by competition fromexisting or new competitors. Second, would any risk of an anticompetitiveeffect be offset by significant efficiency benefits that would result fromintegrating the parties' operations (by contract or otherwise) and thatwould bring about a net increase in consumer welfare? \48\<NOTE/> If it would, then the net effect of the restraint would notbe anticompetitive, and the restraint would not be unlawful.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>National Society of Professional Engineers v. UnitedStates, 435 U.S. 679, 692 (1978); Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia BroadcastingSystem, Inc, <T3>supra </T3>n.45; National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v.

Cognizable efficiencies are those that wouldenable the parties to produce greater output at the same or less cost,or to produce new products or services or undertake Randamp;D that wouldnot be produced or undertaken without such cooperation. An arrangement need not be procompetitive to be lawful, however. The antitrustlaws condemn only anticompetitive conduct; competitively neutral conductis beyond their proscriptive force. Thus, the Department generally examinesthe procompetitive justifications for particular conduct only if a preliminaryeconomic analysis indicates that the conduct would likely create or facilitatethe exercise of market power; if it would not, then there is no need toidentify and weigh the procompetitive benefits of the conduct or to determinewhether there is a less restrictive way to achieve those benefits. The following is a brief description of the Department's basic method ofanalyzing the competitive effects of five types of conduct: criminal violationsof the Sherman Act; mergers; joint ventures; vertical nonprice distributionarrangements; and intellectual property licensing arrangements. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Criminal Offenses Under the Sherman Act </ITAG>A ``naked'' agreement (or common plan) between or among competitors torestrict output and/or raise (or depress) price, which is per se unlawful,\49\<NOTE/> is prosecuted as a criminal violation of the Sherman Act.\50\<NOTE/> An agreement is ``naked'' if its sole purpose and effectis to restrict output and/or raise (or depress) price_that is, if it isnot plausibly related to some economic integration of the parties' operations(beyond simply the coordination of price and/or output) that may resultin increased production. The most common examples of such agreements areprice-fixing and bid-rigging schemes among competitors. Criminal prosecutionof such agreements is particularly appropriate because of their unambiguouslyanticompetitive effect, the difficulty of detecting such agreements (whichusually are covert), and the fact that the conspirators usually know (orshould know) that their conduct is unlawful.\51\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ <T3>See </T3>nn.45-46 and accompanying text, <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ Some section 2 violations, for example, those involvingphysical violence against a competitor, may also be prosecuted as criminalviolations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ The Department traditionally has prosecuted criminallyconduct possessing four characteristics: (1) (except for monopolizationinvolving physical violence) the conduct involves agreements among competitors;(2) the agreements have as their inherent likely effect the raising (orin the case of monopsony, the lowering) of price and restricting of output(2A) without the promise of any significant integrative efficiencies; (3)the agreement or plan is generally covert and fraudulent; and (4) the conspiratorsgenerally are aware of the probable anticompetitive consequences of theirconduct. <T3>See </T3>``Criminal Enforcement of the Antitrust Laws: Targeting NakedCartel Restraints,'' Remarks of Charles F. Rule, Assistant Attorney General,Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, before the 36th Annual ABA AntitrustSection Spring Meeting, March 24, 1988. These characteristics are not,however, legal constraints on the cases that may be prosecuted criminally.Id. <ITAG tagnum="28">In addition to prosecution under the Sherman Act, in appropriate circumstances,naked horizontal agreements may also be prosecuted under a wide varietyof other federal statutes, including statutes prohibiting mail and wirefraud (18 U.S.C. 1341, 1343); conspiracy to defraud the government (18U.S.C. 371); making false statements to a government agency (18 U.S.C.1001); tax offenses (26 U.S.C. 7201); and the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organization (``RICO'') law (18 U.S.C. 1962(c)). In addition tofines and incarceration, the Department may, in appropriate cases, alsoseek to obtain injunctive relief, actual damages under the Clayton Act(15 U.S.C. 15a), and civil penalties up to treble damages under the FalseClaims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729). </ITAG>Neither an express agreement nor overt acts pursuant to an agreement arenecessary to make out a violation of section 1. Nor is it necessary thata particular agreement be successful, or that it has an actual, demonstrableanticompetitive effect; all that is necessary is a ``meeting of the minds.''To constitute unlawful ``price-fixing,'' it is not necessary that conspiratorsagree to charge exactly the same price for a product or service. For example,agreements among competitors to raise their individual prices by a specifiedamount, to maintain a specified profit margin, to adopt a standard formulafor computing price, or to notify one another before reducing price mayalso violate section 1 of the Sherman Act.It is no justification for a naked price or output restricting agreementthat competition is too rigorous, that prices are ``unreasonably low,''or that some firms may exit the market in the absence of such an agreement.Under our free-market system, the unencumbered forces of competition allocatesociety's scarce resources by motivating firms to satisfy the demands ofconsumers as efficiently as possible. Those firms that are unsuccessfulin responding to the market may fail, but their exit from the market willfree resources to be invested by more efficient firms or in areas of theeconomy where they are more highly valued by society. In this way, consumers(including consuming industries) benefit from the highest quality and varietyof products and services at the lowest cost. The Department's analysis of international price and output agreementsamong competitors and various substantive and jurisdictional issues thattypically arise with respect to such agreements is illustrated in Case14 (International Cartel Activity), Case 16 (Voluntary Export Restraint),and Case 17 (Settling a Trade Case). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Mergers </ITAG>As a general matter, the Department recognizes that mergers and acquisitionsplay a crucial, beneficial role in our economy. They can discipline ineffectivemanagement and facilitate the movement of investment capital and productiveassets through the economy to more highly valued uses. They may also enableindustries to undertake restructuring necessary to remain competitive inchanging markets, allow the realization of significant joint-operatingefficiencies, and enable the combined firm to provide new products or betterproducts than either firm could provide separately. Mergers are anticompetitiveonly when they would enable firms that remain in the market following themerger unilaterally or jointly to exercise market power. The standards and principles the Department applies in analyzing mergersare set forth in detail in the Department's Merger Guidelines.\52\<NOTE/> As stated in the Merger Guidelines, the goal of the Department'smerger enforcement policy is to prohibit those mergers that would create,enhance, or facilitate the exercise of market power in the United States.\53\<NOTE/> Where only a few firms account for most of the sales of aproduct or service for which there are no good substitutes, those firmsmight be able tacitly or explicitly to coordinate their actions to restrictoutput and raise price. Other things being equal, where collusion amongfirms is  necessary to exercise market power, such collusion is more likelyto occur and be successful among a small group of firms in a highly concentratedmarket. Reaching and enforcing agreement concerning output or price wouldbe difficult and costly_and would be more likely to be detected by criminalprosecutors_if many firms would have to be included to make collusion successful.Therefore, a merger that would reduce the number of sellers of a productor service in a geographic market to only a few might substantially lessencompetition unless other factors, such as the threat of entry by new sellers,would frustrate the exercise of market power.\54\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ U.S. Department of Justice Merger Guidelines (June 14,1984) (hereinafter cited as ``Merger Guidelines''), <T3>reprinted in </T3>2 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) andpara;andpara; 4491-95. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Merger Guidelines section 1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ <T3>See id. </T3>The ease and profitability of collusion is less relevantwhere a merger involves an acquisition by a single dominant firm (a firmthat has a market share of at least 35 percent) of another firm in themarket. In that case, the dominant firm might itself be able to exercisemarket power by restricting its own output and raising price. The Departmentis likely to challenge a merger between any firm with a market share ofat least one percent and a dominant firm unless changing market conditions(Merger Guidelines section 3.21), the financial condition of the firm (<T3>id. </T3>at section 3.22), ease of entry into the market (<T3>id. </T3>at section 3.3), and significant efficiencies that are likelyto result from the merger (<T3>id. </T3>at section 3.5) indicate that the merger would not be anticompetitive(<T3>id. </T3>at section 3.12).  <T3>Market Definition. </T3>The first step in the Department's merger analysisis to identify the relevant market or markets that would be affected bythe merger and the firms that compete in that market or those markets.\55\<NOTE/> The Merger Guidelines  provide a paradigm for defining therelevant product and geographic markets that is based on analysis of thelikely demand response of consumers and supply response of suppliers toan anticompetitive price increase.\56\<NOTE/> The result of applying this paradigm is to identify a groupof products (the ``product market'') and a geographic area (the ``geographicmarket'') with respect to which sellers could exercise market power ifthey were able to coordinate their actions so as to act like a monopolist.Stated another way, market definition identifies which sellers would haveto coordinate their pricing and/or output decisions to exercise marketpower. Market definition is illustrated in Case 1 of these Guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\<T3>Id. </T3>at section 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 2.1 (product market definition) and section 2.3(geographic market definition).  <T3>Analysis of Relevant Competitive Factors. </T3>If merging firms competein the same product and geographic market, the Department next determineswhether the elimination of competition between them is likely to createor facilitate the exercise of market power. To make this determination,the Department focuses first on the level of concentration in the marketthat would exist after the merger and the increase in concentration thatwould be caused by the merger.\57\<NOTE/> If  market concentration would remain low after the merger,or if concentration would increase only slightly, the Department wouldconclude without detailed examination of other factors that the mergerposes no significant threat to competition.\58\<NOTE/> In other cases, however, the Department would proceed toexamine all other relevant factors bearing on whether the merger wouldlikely result in the ability to restrict output and/or raise price. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ To assist in interpreting market data, the Departmentuses the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (``HHI'') of concentration. The HHIis calculated by summing the squares of the market shares of individualfirms in the market. The HHI gives proportionately greater weight to largerfirms to reflect their relative importance in collusive interaction. MergerGuidelines at section 3.1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ The Department divides the spectrum of market concentrationas measured by the HHI (which ranges from near zero in an atomistic marketto 10,000 in the case of a pure monopoly) into three regions that can bebroadly characterized as unconcentrated (post-merger HHI below 1000), moderatelyconcentrated (post-merger HHI between 1000 and 1800), and highly concentrated(post-merger HHI above 1800). Merger Guidelines section 3.1. Mergers thatwould result in an HHI of less than 1000 are not challenged because thestructure of the market itself indicates that the successful exercise ofmarket power by one or more firms is unlikely. The Department also wouldnot challenge a merger that resulted in moderate concentration if the levelof concentration would increase by 100 HHI points or less, or a mergerthat resulted in high concentration if the level of concentration wouldincrease by 50 HHI points or less. In those cases, the merger would notsignificantly increase concentration in the market. These regions of theHHI are thus ``safe harbors.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.11. <T3>But see </T3>n. 54, <T3>supra. </T3>The Department does not automatically challenge mergersresulting in concentration above those thresholds; rather, much more extensiveanalysis of factors other than concentration data is necessary to concludethat such mergers would create, enhance, or facilitate the exercise ofmarket power.The Department considers a number of factors that may indicate that a firm'scurrent market share either overstates or understates its competitive significance.One such factor is recent or ongoing changes in market conditions. Forexample, if a technology that is important to long-term competititve viabilityis not available to a particular firm, the Department may conclude thatthe historical market share of that firm overstates its future competitivesignificance. The Department will consider the reasonably predictable effectsof changes in market conditions in interpreting market concentration andmarket share data.\59\<NOTE/> The Department will also consider special factors affectingthe competitive significance of foreign firms, such as government restrictionson imports or exports.\60\<NOTE/> The way the Department treats trade restraints in analyzingthe likely competitive effects of a merger is discussed in greater detailbelow and illustrated in Case 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Merger Guidelines at section 3.2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>Id </T3>at section 3.23. In addition to factors that affect the future competitive significanceof individual firms, the Department also considers the likelihood and scopeof substantial new entry into the relevant market,\61\<NOTE/> the likelihood of expansion by fringe firms,\62\<NOTE/> and other factors (such as heterogeneity of the relevantproduct and historical market performance) that may affect the ease andprofitability of collusion in the relevant market.\63\<NOTE/> If entry into the relevant market is so easy that existingcompetitors could not successfully raise price for any significant periodof time, the Department is unlikely to challenge a merger in that market.\64\<NOTE/> For this purpose, the time it would take to enter the relevantmarket at a minimally efficient scale of operation and the level of expectedentry in response to a price increase are at least as important as thefact that entry can occur. Entry may be hindered, for example, by the needfor scarce or specialized resources, the need to achieve a substantialshare of the market in order to realize important economies of scale, orstagnation or decline in the relevant market that would make new entryunlikely to occur.\65\<NOTE/> As the difficulty of entry into the market increases, sodoes the likelihood that the Department will challenge a merger that wouldresult in a high degree of concentration in the relevant market.\66\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>Id </T3>at section 3.3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.33, n.20 and section 3.43. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.3, n.21. <T3>See also </T3>``Merger Enforcement Policy: Protecting the Consumer,''Remarks of Charles F. Rule, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division,U.S. Department of Justice, before the 1987 National Institute, AmericanBar Ass'n Section of Antitrust Law, Oct. 9, 1987, at pp. 10-12. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ Merger Guidelines at section 3.3. The Department also generally will not challenge a merger if the partiescan establish by clear and convincing evidence that the merger would resultin significant net efficiencies that could not be achieved except throughthe merger and that the merger would therefore likely result in a net benefitto consumer welfare.\67\<NOTE/> The parties must establish a proportionately greater levelof expected net efficiencies as the competitive risks of the merger increase.\68\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ <T3>Id. </T3><T3>Foreign Competition. </T3>Nothing in the U.S. antitrust laws restrictsforeign investment in the United States on the basis of the national originof the investment. The Department's antitrust enforcement policy thereforedoes not discriminate against or in favor of firms on the basis of citizenship;the Department is concerned solely with the competitive effects of a transaction.The existence of foreign competition is, however, relevant to the Department'sanalysis of any merger, whether or not one of the parties is foreign. Competitionby foreign firms that are not involved in a merger may make the exerciseof market power in the United States following a merger impossible if thosefirms would likely increase their sales in the United States significantlyin response to a significant and nontransitory price increase. On the other hand, constraints on foreign supply, such as U.S. import quotasand foreign export restraints, may prevent or limit a response by foreignproducers to an anticompetitive price increase in the United States. Existingforeign competitors are not excluded from a relevant market solely becausetheir sales in the United States are subject to such restrictions. Nevertheless,any such constraint on the ability of foreign firms to respond to a priceincrease_and thus to frustrate an attempt to exercise market power in theUnited States_is an important competitive fact that the Department considersin assigning market shares and in interpreting the significance of marketshares and market concentration data. Thus, while the Department's analysis under the Merger Guidelines expresslyrecognizes the significant competitive impact of foreign competition, theDepartment also recognizes the effect of trade restraints in insulatingU.S. firms from foreign competition. The Department's analysis of specialfactors affecting the competitive significance of foreign firms is illustratedin Case 2 of these Guidelines. The Department's analysis of a merger between a domestic and a foreignfirm (including issues relating to market definition) is illustrated inCases 1 and 2. Case 3 illustrates the Department's analysis of a mergerinvolving a foreign potential competitor. Case 4 illustrates the circumstancesin which the Department might challenge a merger between two foreign firms.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Joint Ventures </ITAG>A joint venture is essentially any collaborative effort, short of a merger,among firms with respect to production, Randamp;D, distribution, and/or marketingof products or services. Joint ventures may be created for a variety ofgood business reasons. For example, joint ventures may be created to takeadvantage of complementary skills or economies of scale in production,marketing, or Randamp;D; to spread risk; or, when the venture involves aforeign entity, to give an international enterprise a ``local flavor.''Like mergers, legitimate joint ventures and their ancillary restraintsare analyzed under a rule-of-reason standard and are condemned only ifthey would have an anticompetitive effect that is not outweighed by procompetitivebenefits.\69\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System,Inc., 441 U.S. 1 (1979); National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board ofRegents, 468 U.S. 85 (1984).Simply labelling an arrangement a ``joint venture'' is not controllingfor antitrust purposes, of course. The Department's prosecutorial decisionsare based on substance rather than form. Accordingly, the Department wouldnot hesitate to prosecute criminally an arrangement among competitors thatwas not plausibly related to economic integration of the parties' operationsthat might result in increased production, but that appeared to be simplya device to restrict output and/or raise (or depress) prices. Efficiencyrationalizations constructed after the fact will not save what is actuallya naked bid-rigging or price-fixing cartel; claimed integrative efficienciesmust have been apparent at the time of the formation of the venture.\70\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ A legitimate joint venture and its operating rules willalmost invariably be conducted in the open. When an arrangement's purposeis at issue, other things being equal, the fact that an arrangement iscovert will tend to suggest to the Department that the arrangement is nota legitimate joint venture. <T3>Rule-of-Reason Analysis. </T3>The Department's rule-of-reason analysisof joint ventures involves two steps. First, the Department examines thejoint venture's likely effect on competition in the market (or markets)in which the joint venture proposes to operate or in which the economicintegration of the parties occurs (the ``joint venture market''). Second,the Department determines whether the joint venture would likely have anyanticompetitive effect in other markets in which the venture members alsocompete or might compete (``spill-over'' markets). Relevant markets forthis purpose are defined using the market definition principles set forthin the Merger Guidelines.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ Merger Guidelines section 2.  <T3>Step 1_Joint Venture Market. </T3>The Department first determines whetherthe joint venture would likely have an anticompetitive effect in the jointventure market. If the joint venture participants do not currently competein the joint venture market and are not likely to begin doing so in thenear future independently of the joint venture, the Department can determinewithout detailed examination of other factors that the joint venture posesno significant threat to competition in that market. There may also belittle or no anticompetitive effect in the joint venture market if thejoint venture is structured so that participants would continue to competeagainst each other in that market \72\<NOTE/> or if the joint venture would serve only to create additionalcapacity. In other cases, however, the Department must proceed to examineother factors bearing on whether the joint venture is likely to create,enhance, or facilitate the exercise of market power in the joint venturemarket. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ <T3>See </T3>United States v. Alcan Aluminium Ltd., 605 F. Supp. 619 (W.D.Ky. 1985) (creating a ``competitive rules'' production joint venture tocure competitive problems that would have resulted from a merger of theparties). If a joint venture or any of its restraints would eliminate or restrictcompetition between or among participants in the joint venture market,the Department would determine whether complete integration of the priceand output decisions of the joint venture participants through merger wouldbe anticompetitive. As in merger analysis, the Department focuses firston the level of concentration in the joint venture market after the jointventure is formed and the increase in concentration that would result fromformation of the joint venture. If this analysis indicates that a mergerof the joint venture participants could not be anticompetitive (becauseit would fall within a ``safe harbor'' \73\<NOTE/>), then the Department can conclude without detailed examinationof other factors that the joint venture would not likely have any anticompetitiveeffect in the joint venture market, and proceed to step 2. The Departmentneed not independently examine the competitive effect of the venture'srestraints in the joint venture market, since those restraints could haveno greater anticompetitive effect than would the complete elimination ofcompetition between the joint venture participants in that market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ <T3>See </T3>n.58, <T3>supra.</T3>If market concentration data indicates, however, that a merger of the jointventure participants might be anticompetitive, the Department proceedsto consider other factors bearing on the likely competitive effects ofthe joint venture, including ease of entry into the joint venture marketand significant net integrative efficiencies that would result from thejoint venture.\74\<NOTE/> The Department recognizes, however, that a joint venturemay have a less restrictive effect on the independent decision-making ofjoint venture participants with respect to price and output than wouldan outright merger. For that reason, the joint venture might be unlikelyto create, enhance, or facilitate the exercise of market power in lightof the relevant market circumstances, whereas a complete merger would belikely to do so. Moreover, net efficiencies that would result from thejoint venture would be more likely to outweigh any anticompetitive risks.In addition, the parties may be able to structure their joint venture,for example, to include operational safeguards, in order to eliminate orreduce substantially any threat to competition from the joint venture.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.2., <T3>supra. </T3>As is implicit in this analysis, the Department in general is concernedabout the effect of a joint venture in the joint venture market when theventure creates or facilitates the exercise of market power as a resultof being overinclusive. Although the exclusion of competitors from participationsometimes has been the focus of antitrust concern in the past, exclusionfrom membership in a joint venture rarely is anticompetitive. Limitingthe number of participants in a joint venture will not harm U.S. consumers,since the monopoly profits earned by the joint venture will be the sameregardless of the number of participants in the joint venture. In fact, selectivity in the membership of a joint venture generally enhancesa joint venture's procompetitive potential. An enforcement policy thatrequired joint ventures to open membership to all who sought it (or tolicense the product of an Randamp;D joint venture to all who sought licenses)would decrease the incentives to form joint ventures, particularly thoseformed to undertake risky endeavors such as Randamp;D and innovative manufacturing.First, the inability to exclude those who would bring little, if anything,to the joint venture, or those who would fail to share fully in the risks,would decrease the efficiency of the joint venture and reduce the expectedreward from successfully accomplishing the joint venture's mission. Second,an enforcement policy that denied a joint venture the ability to selectits members might encourage firms to forego risky endeavors in the hopesof being able to gain access through antitrust litigation to the fruitsof the successful endeavors of others. Thus, only where a joint ventureis the only one of its kind possible in the relevant market is there anypossibility of concern about the exclusionary effects of limited membership.<T3>Step 2_Spill-Over Markets. </T3>The Department next determines whetherthe joint venture or any of its ancillary restraints \75\<NOTE/> would likely have an anticompetitive ``spill-over'' effectin other markets in which the joint venture participants compete or mightcompete. For example, an association of widget manufacturers formed topurchase joint transportation services may possess no monopsony power withrespect to purchasing such services, but under certain circumstances maybe able to use the association to coordinate the price and output of widgets.Spill-over analysis is likely to be particularly relevant where U.S. firmsform a joint venture to operate in a foreign market. In that case, theDepartment generally is not concerned about the venture's effect on competitionin the foreign market \76\<NOTE/> but may be concerned about the exchange of competitivelysensitive information among competitors in the U.S. market, for example. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ To be ``ancillary,'' a restraint must be plausibly relatedto the legitimate ends of the joint venture_that is, the restraint mustnot be a ``naked'' agreement which is designed simply to restrict outputand/or to raise price in some market other than the joint venture market.<T3>See </T3>discussion of naked restraints of trade at nn.45-46 and accompanyingtext, <T3>supra. </T3>For example, the Department would likely regard a secondaryagreement in a joint venture to produce pocket calculators that restrictedcompetition in the production of ball point pens not to be plausibly relatedto the integration of the parties' operations achieved by the joint venture.Such a restraint may therefore be subject to prosecution, possibly as acriminal violation of the Sherman Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ This would be the case unless the U.S. government throughpayments or financing would substantially bear the cost of an affectedtransaction. <T3>See </T3>discussion at n.41 and accompanying text, <T3>supra, </T3>and Case 5. In some cases, because of procedural or operational safeguards incorporatedin a joint venture, an elaborate structural analysis will not be necessaryin order to conclude that neither the joint venture nor its ancillary restraintsposes a threat of anticompetitive spill-over effects. Examples of safeguardsthat can minimize the risk of spill-over effects include a requirementthat certain types of sensitive business information be disclosed onlyto neutral third parties, a requirement that meetings involving representativesof the venture members be monitored by knowledgeable counsel, or a requirementthat accurate and complete records of such discussions be maintained.\77\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ With respect to shipping associations, for example, theDepartment has suggested three safeguards against anticompetitive spill-overeffects. First, association members would not be required to tender allof their shipments through the association, but would be free to use ratesnegotiated by any other association and rates that members negotiated independently.Second, negotiations between an association and a carrier or shipping conferencewould be conducted on a confidential basis by an officer or employee ofthe association who is not also an employee of a member. Third, all communicationsbetween the association and individual members would be kept confidential.See ``The Antitrust Division's Approach to Shippers' Associations,'' Remarksof Charles F. Rule, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division,U.S. Department of Justice, Before the Chemical Manufacturers Association,Oct. 21, 1985 (setting forth guidelines for assessing the competitive effectsof shipping associations) (hereinafter cited as ``Shippers Speech''). <T3>See also </T3>Letter from Charles F. Rule, Assistant Attorney General,Antitrust Division, to Jerome J.C. Ingels of Petroleum Independents Cooperative,Inc., March 9, 1988 (indicating no present intention to challenge proposedassociation of natural gas producers to negotiate and market services thatmembers are too small to provide alone, where several safeguards againstanticompetitive conduct are in place); ETC Guidelines, 50 Fed.

Of course, no significant anticompetitive risks would necessarily existeven in the absence of such safeguards if conditions in the spill-overmarket would make successful collusion unlikely. Therefore, even if safeguardsare not used by the joint venture, before challenging a joint venture orits ancillary restraints, the Department would examine market concentrationand other relevant economic factors to determine whether there would likelybe any anticompetitive effects in a spill-over market.\78\<NOTE/> There might be no significant anticompetitive effects, forexample, where the joint venture members account for only a small percentageof the spill-over market, or where there are strong disincentives for thejoint venture members to collude in the spill-over market.\79\<NOTE/> If the structural characteristics of the relevant spill-overmarket indicated that an anticompetitive effect was possible, then theDepartment would consider whether the efficiency benefits of employinga particular ancillary restraint outweighed any threat to competition inthe spill-over market.\80\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ <T3>See </T3>Shippers Speech, <T3>supra </T3>n.77. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Letter from William F.

Vertical Nonprice Distribution Restraints </ITAG>Vertical nonprice distribution restraints are arrangements between firmsoperating at different levels of the manufacturing or distribution chain(for example, between a manufacturer and a wholesaler or a wholesaler anda retailer) that restrict the conditions under which firms may purchase,sell, or resell goods.\81\<NOTE/> As the Supreme Court recognized in <T3>Continental T.V., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>GTE Sylvania, Inc.,\82\</T3><NOTE/> vertical nonprice restraints are often procompetitive.\83\<NOTE/> They generally promote competition by allowing a manufacturerto achieve efficiencies in the distribution of its products and by permittingfirms to compete through different methods of distribution. Firms enteringa market, for example, can use such restrictions ``to induce competentand aggressive retailers to make the kind of investment in capital andlabor that is often required in the distribution of products unknown tothe consumer.'' \84\<NOTE/> Such restrictions can also serve to protect investments bya manufacturer's dealers in service and promotion related to the manufacturer'sbrands from other dealers who do not make such investments but cut theirprice in  order to take advantage of the full-service dealers' investments(the so-called ``free-rider'' problem). As the Supreme Court has recognized,vertical nonprice restraints can in this way increase competition amongcompeting manufacturers (or interbrand competition), which is the primaryconcern of antitrust law.\85\<NOTE/> Eliminating the free-rider problem is only one way in whichvertical nonprice restraints can enhance competition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ Another way to describe vertical arrangements is as agreementsinvolving the owners of complementary inputs; under this terminology, horizontalagreements are those involving the owners of substitute inputs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ 433 U.S. 36, 54-57 (1977). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ An agreement between a manufacturer and one or more distributorssetting the resale price of the manufacturer's product is per se illegal.However, a vertical distribution restraint is per se illegal only if itincludes some agreement on price or price levels; a distribution restraintthat may only affect price is analyzed under the rule of reason. <T3>See</T3> Sharp, <T3>supra </T3>n.43, 56 U.S.L.W. at 4392. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Continental T.V., Inc. v.

Under special market conditions, certain vertical nonprice restraints conceivablymight serve to facilitate collusion among competing manufacturers withrespect to the price and/or output of their products.\86\<NOTE/> For example, dealers might induce all or almost all suppliersof a product to award exclusive territories in order to facilitate a cartelat the dealer level by reducing the number of dealers that must colludeand protecting colluding dealers from the threat of outside competitionin response to anticompetitive pricing. In addition, suppliers might attemptto facilitate collusion among dealers where dealer collusion would be morepractical or less costly than direct collusion among the suppliers andthe suppliers can share in the resulting monopoly profits.\87\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ The general standards and specific principles the Departmentapplies in analyzing the competitive effects of vertical nonprice distributionrestraints are set forth in detail in the Department's Vertical RestraintsGuidelines. U.S. Department of Justice Vertical Restraints Guidelines,Jan. 23, 1985 (hereinafter cited as ``Vertical Restraints Guidelines'').The Supreme Court noted in Sharp, 56 U.S.L.W. at 4389, however, that ``supportfor the cartel-facilitating effect of vertical nonprice restraints wasand remains lacking.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ <T3>But see id.</T3>Vertical nonprice restraints will not facilitate such collusion, however,unless three necessary (but not sufficient) market conditions exist aftera restraint is imposed: (i) The ``primary'' level of the market that instigatesthe restraint (the manufacturer level or the dealer level) must be veryhighly concentrated; (ii) firms at the ``secondary'' level of the marketusing the restraint (or very similar restraints) must account for a largeportion of sales in that market; and (iii) entry into the primary marketmust be difficult.\88\<NOTE/> Unless the level of the market instigating the restraintis very highly concentrated, it is implausible that vertical nonprice restraintswould serve to coordinate and police pricing and/or output decisions amongcompetitors at that level without an express agreement among them.\89\<NOTE/> A vertical nonprice restraint is also unlikely to resultin successful  collusion unless the combined market share of firms at thesecondary level of the market using the restraint is large; otherwise,secondary level firms not subject to the same or similar restraints wouldlikely frustrate any collusion.\90\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ Vertical Restraints Guidelines section 3.21. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ If the Department had evidence of such an agreement,of course, the agreement would likely be prosecuted as a violation of section1 of the Sherman Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ Vertical Restraints Guidelines section 3.21. Under special market conditions, a vertical restraint might also resultin the anticompetitive exclusion \91\<NOTE/> of rivals from the market by denying them access to an essentialinput or to essential distribution facilities. A restraint (for example,an exclusive dealing arrangement) will not have an anticompetitive exclusionaryeffect in a relevant market unless three necessary (but not sufficient)market conditions exist: (i) The market in which firms using the restraintoperate (the ``nonforeclosed'' market) must be very highly concentratedand leading firms in the market must use the restraint; (ii) firms subjectto the restraint must control a large share of the ``foreclosed'' market;and (iii) entry into the ``foreclosed'' market must be difficult. Anticompetitiveexclusion is not likely to result from a vertical nonprice restraint ifany of  these conditions are absent. Unless the firms imposing the restraintsare very few in number, control most or all of the ``nonforeclosed'' market,and are currently earning monopoly profits, they will have neither theincentive nor the ability effectively to exclude other competitors fromthe market through a foreclosure strategy. In addition, unless the restraintapplies to all or a very large portion of firms in the ``foreclosed'' market,rivals could simply use remaining available capacity to enter or expandin the market.\92\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ All contracts between two parties in some sense excludenon-contracting parties. The antitrust laws are concerned, however, onlywith exclusion that will result in the ability to exercise power over priceand/or output in a relevant market. <T3>See </T3>National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States,435 U.S. 679, 687-90 (1978); Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,433 U.S. 36, 49 (1977); Chicago Board of Trade v.

Even if the minimum necessary conditions exist, of course, other marketconditions may prevent a particular nonprice vertical restraint from havingeither a collusive or an exclusionary effect in any relevant market. Moreover,any competitive effect may be outweighed by the procompetitive benefitsof the arrangement. As a general matter, the Department employs a two-step analysis to determinewhether a particular vertical nonprice restraint is likely to be anticompetitive.<T3>Step 1. </T3>First, the Department takes a ``quick look'' at the degreeof concentration in the relevant markets and at the market shares of firmsemploying the restraint to determine whether the restraint could plausiblyhave an anticompetitive effect.\93\<NOTE/> If the necessary market conditions for successful collusionor anticompetitive exclusion_most significantly, high concentration atthe level instigating the restraint_are not met, the Department can quicklydetermine that a restraint is not anticompetitive. In addition to the necessaryminimum conditions described above, if a particular firm using a restrainthas a small market share (e.g., ten percent or less), its use of the restraintnormally would not be anticompetitive. Firms with such small market sharesdo not possess market power individually, and are unlikely to be importantto any cartel \94\<NOTE/> or agreement to facilitate a cartel or to any exclusionaryscheme. Of course, if there were evidence that a small firm employing restraintswas part of an unlawful cartel among competitors, the Department wouldnot hesitate to investigate its activities and, if appropriate, prosecutethose activities criminally.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 4.1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 4.134. In most cases, the minimum necessary conditions will not exist, and a cursoryexamination of the restraint under step 1 will indicate that the verticalrestraint is safe from legal challenge by the Department. If the minimumnecessary market conditions for either collusion or anticompetitive exclusiondo exist, however, the Department proceeds to a closer rule-of-reason analysisto determine the restraint's likely net effect on consumer welfare.\95\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ Vertical Restraints Guidelines at section 4.2. <T3>Step 2. </T3>The Department first assesses the likelihood that entryby new firms at either of the relevant market levels would frustrate anycollusion or exclusion scheme. As in the case of merger analysis, the Department'sfocus is on whether significant entry would occur within a relatively shortperiod of time in response to an anticompetitive price increase.\96\<NOTE/> If entry is sufficiently difficult that it cannot be expectedto reduce substantially any anticompetitive potential of the restraint,then the Department proceeds to consider other factors, including whetherthe restraint has had an exclusionary effect (if there is sufficient experiencefrom which to judge); whether the restraint has survived for a long period;whether the restraint is ``airtight'' (considering, for example, the severityof penalities for abrogating the terms of a restraint); whether marketconditions are conducive either to collusion or to anticompetitive exclusion;and whether use of the restraint results in significant integrative efficienciesproducing benefits to consumer welfare that outweigh the risk of potentialanticompetitive harm. Where vertical restraints have been in existencefor a sufficient length of time to make it possible to evaluate their competitiveeffects, the Department would look primarily to an analysis of those effects.All other things being equal, the Department would more likely challengea restraint that may have an anticompetitive effect if there is a historyof collusion by firms at either level of the market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\96\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 4.21. Case 8 of these Guidelines illustrates the Department's vertical analysisin the context of a foreign firm's use of an exclusive distribution arrangementin the United States. The Department's vertical analysis in the contextof various types of intellectual property licensing arrangements is alsodiscussed below and illustrated in Cases 10, 11, and 12. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Intellectual Property Licensing Arrangements </ITAG>For the purpose of antitrust analysis, intellectual property (e.g., patents,copyrights, trade secrets, and know-how) is essentially comparable to anyother form of tangible or intangible property that is created, transferred,or used in the production of goods or services. At one time, antitrustpolicy proceeded on the assumption that intellectual property rights andthe licensing of those rights conflicted with the goals of the antitrustlaws because intellectual property rights were thought to create ``monopolies.''Intellectual property_even a patent_does not, however, necessarily conferan economic monopoly or even market power on its owner. A patent is merelya legally cognizable property right to the exclusive use of technical informationspecified in the patent grant. The patent remains subject to competitionfrom information outside its scope that is an economic substitute for thepatented product or process. For example, two patented pharmaceuticalsmay be economic substitutes for the same medical indication, and any attemptby one patent owner to raise the price of its drug would result in substitutiontoward the other drug. To the extent that a patent or some other form of intellectual propertydoes confer some competitive advantage on its owner (even to the extentof conferring a true economic monopoly) it is still comparable to otherkinds of property that yield similar benefits. A new, state-of-the-artproduction facility, for example, may give its owner a competitive advantagein the form of lower production costs, perhaps for a significant periodof time. The owner of intellectual property is fully entitled to enjoywhatever market power the property itself confers. Respecting the rightsof an intellectual property owner to enjoy the full value of the propertyit has created provides an incentive for the innovative effort requiredto create intellectual property. The results of that innovative effort,in turn, expand society's knowledge and wealth and increase productiveefficiency.<T3>Licenses. </T3>Licenses of patents and other forms of intellectualproperty are contracts transferring to the licensees a right to use intellectualproperty. The licensing of intellectual property benefits consumers byexpanding access to technology and bringing it to the marketplace in thequickest and most efficient manner. Licensing permits the owner of technologyto, in effect, combine the owner's assets with the manufacturing and distributionassets of others. By permitting the owner to exploit the owner's intellectualproperty as efficiently and effectively as possible, licensing also increasesthe perceived value of intellectual property and increases incentives toinvest in creating the property in the first place. Particular restraints in intellectual property licenses can play an importantrole in encouraging the efficient development and use of licensed technology.This may be essential to ensure that new technology realizes its maximumlegitimate return and benefits consumers as quickly and efficiently aspossible. A licensor, for example, may encourage a licensee to make investmentsthat are necessary to develop and promote the licensed technology by givingthe licensee some exclusive use of that technology. Similarly, allowingthe owner of intellectual property to reserve some exclusive use of thelicensed property to itself encourages efficient licensing of technologywhere the owner of intellectual property otherwise might choose not tolicense its property at all.\97\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ For examples of other procompetitive intellectual propertylicense restrictions, see ``The Antitrust Implications of InternationalLicensing: After the Nine No-no's,'' Remarks by Charles F. Rule beforethe Legal Conference sponsored by the World Trade Association and the CincinnatiPatent Law Association (Oct. 21, 1986). <T3>Rule of Reason Analysis. </T3>Because of their generally procompetitivenature, the Department analyzes the competitive effects of intellectualproperty licenses and their restrictions under a rule of reason, unlessthe underlying transfer of technology is a sham \98\<NOTE/> or the license restrictions restrain competition betweenthe licensor and licensee and bear no relationship to the underlying transferof technology. Under the rule-of-reason analysis, the license and its ancillaryrestrictions are considered to be unlawful only if they are used to facilitatecollusion or suppress competition in some relevant market and the riskof anticompetitive effects is not outweighed by the procompetitive benefitsof the restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\98\ A license is regarded as a sham if the parties demonstrablyare not interested in conveying and receiving intellectual property rights,but rather are using the license as a guise to cover an effort to restrictoutput and/or raise price in some other market. Restrictions on competitionaccompanying a sham license may be per se unlawful and, where appropriate,prosecuted criminally. The Department does not normally inquire whether a particular license restrictionis necessary to accomplish its procompetitive goals, or whether some lessrestrictive alternative could be used to achieve the same goals. In general,the Department considers the cumulative effects of all restrictions inan intellectual property license: if cumulatively the restrictions wouldhave no significant anticompetitive effects or if any anticompetitive effectswould be outweighed by the cumulative procompetitive benefits of the licensingarrangement, then none of the restrictions would be challenged. The rule-of-reason analysis the Department applies to intellectual propertylicenses is the same as it applies to all other integrative contracts.Restrictions in a license may explicitly or implicitly entail horizontalrestraints, vertical restaints, or both, depending on the relationshipof the parties. A horizontal restraint is one that limits competition betweenthe licensor and licensee in one or more markets \99\<NOTE/> in which they are actual or potential competitors.\100\<NOTE/> A vertical restraint is one that does not eliminate horizontalcompetition between the licensor and licensee, but may limit competitionbetween the intellectual property owner and other owners of intellectualproperty, or between the licensee and other licensees who are not partiesto the license. In each instance the Department seeks to determine whetherthe license restriction would create or facilitate the unilateral or concertedexercise of market power. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ For example, a license might restrict the persons towhom or prices at which the parties can license competing technologies.Or, a license might restrict the price and/or output decisions of the partieswith respect to some product that they do or would sell in competitionwith each other. <T3>See </T3>Andewelt, ``Analysis of Patent Pools Under the Antitrust Laws,''53 Antitrust L.J. 611 (1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.2., <T3>supra. </T3>The Department's analysis of technology license restrictions under therule of reason is generally guided by two principles. First, the antitrustlaws do not proscribe licensing arrangements that simply represent an effortby the owner of intellectual property fully to appropriate the inherentvalue of the technology. The potential for appropriating that value isthe economic incentive to engage in risky and costly Randamp;D in the firstplace. Second, the antitrust laws do not require the owner of technologyto create competition in its own technology.<T3>Horizontal Restraints. </T3>If the licensor and licensee are competitorsin the technology market in which the intellectual property being licensedcompetes, or if the licensor and licensee are competitors in some othermarket that is affected by restrictions in the license, then the licenseand its restraints are properly analyzed as a horizontal agreement. A licenserestriction might, for example, prohibit a licensee that owns a competingtechnology from selling products that could be made using the competingtechnology in the United States. This is a horizontal restraint.\101\<NOTE/> Alternatively, a license may be tantamount to the licensee'sacquisition of the licensor's technology in a market. Again, if the licenseeowns a competing technology (or is one of only a very few persons thatcould be expected to develop a competing technology), then this is properlyanalyzed as a horizontal restraint. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ That does not mean, of course, that the restraint isanticompetitive and, therefore, unlawful. So long as the restriction isnot part of a sham licensing scheme disguising a naked cartel, it shouldbe analyzed under a rule of reason. Horizontal restraints in an intellectual property license would be analyzedas a joint venture.\102\<NOTE/> The Department would begin its analysis by defining the relevanttechnology or other market or markets that would be affected by the horizontalrestraint. The Department would not assume that a patent or other pieceof intellectual property delimited the relevant market. As explained above,there may be economic substitutes for that property which would make anyattempt to exercise unilateral market power impossible. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.3., <T3>supra. </T3>After defining the relevant market or markets in which the licensee andlicensor compete and that are affected by a horizontal restraint, the Departmentwould apply the analysis set forth in the Merger Guidelines to determinewhether the complete elimination of competition between the licensee andlicensor in that market by virtue of their merger would be anticompetitive.\103\<NOTE/> Even if a complete merger of the parties would be anticompetitive,however, the restraint would not necessarily be anticompetitive, sinceit may not restrict competition in the relevant market or markets as completelyas would the total economic integration entailed by a merger. The Departmentwould therefore examine the precise nature and extent of the eliminationof price and output decision-making that would result from the licenserestriction.\104\<NOTE/> If the Department's analysis disclosed that restrictionsin a license could be significantly anticompetitive, then the Departmentwould go on to assess their competitive benefits and whether the benefitsoutweigh the likely anticompetitive effects. In general, the Departmentwill consider the cumulative effects_both procompetitive and anticompetitive_ofall the restrictions, rather than examining each restriction in isolation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\103\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines sections 3.1-3.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\104\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.3., <T3>supra. </T3>As with any joint venture, the Department would generally not be concernedthat a horizontal intellectual property licensing arrangement (for example,a patent pool) was not opened to competitors, even if it was the only possibleventure in the relevant market.\105\<NOTE/> A patentee should not be compelled to forego its statutoryright to exclude the world from sharing in its invention simply becauseit has chosen not to exclude a few. The anticompetitive effects from selectivelyallowing some but not all competitors to participate in a horizontal intellectualproperty agreement will rarely, if ever, outweigh the procompetitive incentivesto innovate and to exploit new technologies guaranteed by that selectivity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\105\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of joint venture analysis at I.B.3., <T3>supra. </T3><T3>Vertical Restraints. </T3>Because an intellectual property licensetypically involves the combination of complementary inputs_that is, thelicensor and licensee do not compete in any market affected by the license_anyrestrictions in the license will best be characterized as vertical restraints.The Department will challenge purely vertical restraints in intellectualproperty licenses only in exceptional circumstances. For example, it isunlikely that vertical restraints in a license for technology that hasno economic substitutes would ever be challenged by the Department. Anexclusive license to a single licensee carries too little, if any, riskof collusion and too great an inherent procompetitive potential to warrantantitrust condemnation. Vertical restraints in an intellectual propertylicense are analyzed in the same way the Department analyzes vertical restraintsgenerally,\106\<NOTE/> although intellectual property licensing arrangements areeven more likely than other kinds of vertical agreements to produce significantprocompetitive benefits. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.4., <T3>supra. </T3>The Department's analysis of various common types of intellectual propertylicensing arrangements is illustrated in Cases 10, 11, and 12 of theseGuidelines. Case 10 illustrates the Department's analysis of purely verticalrestrictions in a patent license. Case 11 illustrates the Department'sanalysis of an exclusive patent cross-license with grantbacks. Case 12illustrates the Department's analysis of a know-how technology transferagreement with exclusive territories. C. Jurisdictional Considerations Just as the acts of U.S. citizens in a foreign nation ordinarily are subjectto the law of the country in which they take place, the acts of foreigncitizens in the United States ordinarily are subject to U.S. law. The reachof the U.S. antitrust laws is not limited solely to conduct and transactionsthat occur within the United States, however. As a general matter, conductrelating to U.S. import trade that harms consumers in the United Statesis subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws regardless ofwhere such conduct technically occurs or the nationality of the partiesinvolved. Thus, for example, applying the Sherman Act to restrain or punisha private international cartel, the purpose and effect of which is to restrictoutput and raise prices to U.S. consumers, is both appropriate and necessaryto effective enforcement of that Act. On the other hand, the Sherman Actwould not properly be applied to the activities of U.S. and/or foreignfirms in foreign markets that had no direct, substantial, or reasonablyforeseeable effect on competition or consumers in the United States.\107\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 6a (1982), discussed below. <T3>See also </T3>McGlinchy v.

The Department attempts to give practicalmeaning to the terms ``direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable''by taking action in those cases where there is or would be a significantadverse effect on consumers in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act </ITAG>Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \109\<NOTE/> foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities are immunefrom suit in U.S. courts, except under specifically delineated circumstances.The most commonly applied exception in antitrust cases is the so-called``commercial acts'' exception. Under that exception, foreign sovereignsand their agencies and instrumentalities may be sued for their commercialactivities.\110\<NOTE/> Application of this exception to the Foreign Sovereign ImmunitiesAct is illustrated in Case 14 of these Guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ 28 U.S. 1330, 1602-1611 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ <T3>See id. </T3>at section 1605(a)(2); <T3>see, e.g., </T3>Laker Airways v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 731F.2d 909, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1984). D. Factors Affecting the Department's Discretionin Asserting Jurisdiction In enforcing the antitrust laws, the Department recognizes that considerationsof comity among nations_the notion that foreign nations are due deferencewhen acting within their legitimate spheres of authority_properly playa role in determining ``the recognition which one nation allows withinits territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of anothernation.'' \111\<NOTE/> Moreover, the pattern of U.S. trade suggests that an unlimitedapplication of the antitrust laws in the international context could significantlyaffect the sovereign interests of foreign nations and have far-reachingand potentially detrimental effects on U.S. foreign relations without significantlybenefitting U.S. consumer welfare. Thus, even where conduct would affectU.S. consumers, as a matter of comity and in the exercise of its prosecutorialdiscretion, the Department considers the significant interests of othernations in every case in which they may be implicated.\112\<NOTE/> In fact, the Department is committed to consider the legitimateinterests of other nations in accordance with recommendations of the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and with bilateral agreementswith several foreign governments.\113\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895). <T3>See generally </T3>McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional, 372 U.S. 10 (1963);Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571 (1953); The Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2Cranch) 64 (1804). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ In lieu of bringing an enforcement action, of course,the Department may consult with affected foreign sovereigns through appropriatediplomatic channels to eliminate or substantially to reduce anticompetitiveeffects in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28">In the Department's view, government actions should not be subjectto dismissal on the basis of comity. A decision by the U.S. governmentto prosecute an action amounts to a determination by the Executive Branchthat the interests of the United States supercede the interests of anyforeign sovereign and that the challenged conduct is more harmful to theUnited States than would be any injury to foreign relations that mightresult from the antitrust action. Thus, government suits do not createthe risk raised by private actions that a judicial finding of liabilitywill intrude on the legitimate interests of foreign sovereigns. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ <T3>See </T3>n.1, <T3>supra. </T3>In determining whether it would be reasonable to assert jurisdiction orseek particular remedies in a given case, the Department first considerswhether any significant interests of foreign nations would in fact be affectedby such exercise of jurisdiction. Experience shows that in most cases acountry's application of its competition laws to protect its own consumerswill not adversely affect the significant interests of other sovereigns.If it appeared that applying U.S. antitrust laws to particular transnationalconduct would have such an effect, however, the Department generally wouldconsider the following six factors: (1) The relative significance, to the violation alleged, of conduct withinthe United States as compared to conduct abroad; (2) The nationality of the persons involved in or affected by the conduct;(3) The presence or absence of a purpose to affect United States consumersor competitors; (4) The relative significance and foreseeability of the effects of theconduct on the United States as compared to the effects abroad; (5) The existence of reasonable expectations that would be furthered ordefeated by the action; and (6) The degree of conflict with foreign law or articulated foreign economicpolicies.\114\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ Similar factors are included in proposed legislationwhich would govern the exercise of jurisdiction by U.S. courts in privateantitrust litigation that arises out of disputes involving foreign or transnationalconduct.

(1986).<ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, in extraordinary circumstances, the Executive Branchmay take into account the effect of antitrust prosecution on the UnitedStates' foreign relations.\115\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Department of Justice Press Release, dated Nov. 19,1984 (announcing President's decision to close grand jury investigationfor foreign policy reasons). The Department does not believe, however,that this factor should properly be considered by courts in the contextof either private litigation or in litigation initiated by the United States,since the conduct of foreign relations is constitutionally reserved tothe Executive Branch. E. Foreign Sovereign Compulsion In some cases, foreign sovereign authorities may have compelled privateparties to engage in conduct that has an anticompetitive effect on U.S.commerce. A sensible approach to the antitrust laws that accommodates notionsof comity supports the reading of an implied (and thus limited) defenseto application of the U.S. antitrust laws based on foreign sovereign compulsion.As discussed above,\116\<NOTE/> Congress enacted our antitrust laws against the backgroundof well-recognized principles of international comity among nations whichgive due deference to the lawful acts of foreign sovereigns acting withintheir legitimate spheres of authority. That deference is most acutely calledfor when a foreign sovereign has actually compelled the conduct in question.\117\<NOTE/> Indeed, in a system of international trade where the UnitedStates can be found negotiating for certain export restraints, it wouldbe anomalous not to recognize the existence of foreign sovereign compulsion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ <T3>See </T3>I.D., <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ Recognizing this defense also ensures that U.S. andforeign firms will not be unfairly subjected to prosecution under the U.S.antitrust laws for activities compelled by another sovereign. In the absenceof considerations of comity and direct conflict with the significant nationalinterests of a foreign sovereign, however, abstract and undefined notionsof ``fairness'' to firms that engage in anticompetitive conduct shouldnot obstruct the legitimate prosecution of antitrust offenses that directly,substantially and foreseeably affect U.S. consumers in direct contraventionof the U.S. antitrust laws. Under the following circumstances, therefore, the Department will not prosecuteanticompetitive conduct that has been compelled by a foreign sovereign.\118\<NOTE/> First, a foreign sovereign actually must have compelled theanticompetitive conduct \119\<NOTE/> in circumstances in which a refusal to comply with the foreignsovereign's mandate would give rise to significant penalties (as opposedto the mere denial of benefits, for example). It is not enough that privateanticompetitive conduct is merely encouraged, permitted by, or consistentwith the laws or policies of the foreign sovereign. While such foreigngovernment encouragement or permission may be taken into account in a generalcomity analysis, it will not have the determinative effect of actual compulsion;the lack of compulsion may also be strongly indicative of the fact thatenforcing our antitrust laws would not impinge significantly on the nationalinterests of the foreign sovereign.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ Foreign sovereign compulsion is not properly regardedas a legal defense in antitrust suits brought by the United States, however.A decision by the United States to prosecute an action amounts to a determinationby the Executive Branch that the challenged conduct is more harmful tothe United States than would be any injury to foreign relations that mightresult from the antitrust action. Thus, government suits do not createthe risk raised by private actions that a judicial finding of liabilityfor compelled conduct will significantly interfere with the conduct offoreign relations by the Executive Branch. As a practical matter, however,the Department generally would not challenge conduct to which the foreignsovereign compulsion defense would apply in private litigation. <T3>See </T3>Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners,Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., No. 83-2004 (June1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ <T3>See</T3> Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide andamp; Carbon Corp., 370U.S. 690 (1962); Sociedad Nacional, <T3>supra, </T3>n.111, 372 U.S. at 21. Second, the foreign sovereign's command must have been within the scopeof its authority under its own laws. For this purpose, a foreign government'sformal assertion concerning the existence and meaning of its domestic lawordinarily would be conclusive. Third, deference to the foreign state's actions must be warranted underthe circumstances. This criterion is not intended to swallow the notionof foreign sovereign compulsion. Consistent with accepted principles ofinternational comity, however, the Executive Branch may determine in agiven case that the national interests of the United States are more significantlyaffected than are those of the foreign sovereign, or that the compelledconduct would be more harmful to the United States than would be any potentialfor injury to U.S. foreign relations that may result from an antitrustsuit. Finally, although territorial tests are often difficult to apply, and aretherefore often not useful, in cases where the compelled conduct plainlyhas occurred wholly or primarily in the United States, the Department willnot generally recognize foreign sovereign compulsion as a defense. An exampleof conduct occurring in the United States as to which the defense wouldnot apply is a foreign government requirement that a U.S. subsidiary ofa foreign firm organize a cartel in the United States with other U.S. firmsto fix the price at which products would be sold in some local U.S. market.Foreign sovereign compulsion should be distinguished from the federalism-basedstate action doctrine. The state action doctrine applies to private anticompetitiveconduct that is taken pursuant to clearly articulated state policies andis subject to active state supervision, as well as to conduct that actuallyis compelled by a state.\120\<NOTE/> The Sherman Act doctrine of state action embodies the notionthat the U.S. Congress should not be presumed to have intended to interferewith the authority of the states ``constitutionally to regulate their domesticcommerce.'' \121\<NOTE/> Because our federal structure of government is designed tosecure to the states a wide range of regulatory alternatives, the U.S.Supreme Court has held that state compulsion is too strict a standard toemploy in state action cases.\122\<NOTE/> The federal government retains authority under the SupremacyClause to void any state cartel program that has a noxious effect on interstatecommerce. In contrast, the sovereign compulsion defense serves the quitedifferent purpose of preventing direct clashes with the most significantinterests of foreign sovereigns. This purpose is advanced most directlywhen the foreign government has actually compelled the challenged conduct.\123\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See </T3>Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943); Southern Motor CarriersRate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48 (1985). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ Southern Motor Carriers, <T3>supra </T3>n.120, 471 U.S. at 56. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\ <T3>Id., </T3>471 U.S. at 61. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\ <T3>Id. </T3>In addition, a standard like that of the state action doctrine would bedifficult to apply in the international context. Given the complexity andnovelty of foreign legal systems and the difficulty of obtaining foreign-locatedevidence, private firms would have many opportunities to attempt to evadelegitimate application of the U.S. antitrust laws wherever there was anarguable foreign national policy underlying anticompetitive conduct. Inaddition, the use of an ``active supervision'' standard of the sort appliedin state action cases would require difficult inquiries into the foreignsovereign's conduct of its own affairs.\124\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ <T3>Id. </T3>Difficult legal and policy issues nonetheless may arise when a foreigngovernment instigates, but does not strictly compel, export restraintsby firms within its jurisdiction. Considerations of international comitymay lead the Department not to challenge export restraints that clearlyhave arisen from the decision and actions of a foreign government and areintended to promote significant national economic interests of that sovereign,even if the restraints formally have not been compelled. This is especiallytrue if the foreign government has instigated the restraints at the requestof the U.S. government. The Department's analysis of this kind of situationis illustrated in Case 16, which deals with a voluntary export restraint.Businesses may obtain greater certainty concerning their liability forconforming to the anticompetitive order of a foreign government by seekingto obtain an opinion of the Department under its Business Review Procedure.\125\<NOTE/> Case 14 of these Guidelines addresses the issue of foreignsovereign compulsion in the context of a cartel governing sales made inthe United States.\126\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\ 28 CFR 50.6. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\126\ For an example of an arrangement as to which the Departmentconcluded that the defense of sovereign compulsion would apply, see Exchangeof Letters between Japanese Ambassador Yoshio Okawara and Attorney GeneralWilliam French Smith, May 7, 1981, <T3>reproduced in </T3>U.S. Import Weekly (BNA), May 13, 1981, at M-1 toM-2. F. International Trade Friction and the U.S. Trade Laws Governmental and private conduct undertaken pursuant to the U.S. tradelaws, or to resolve disputes causing international trade friction, oftenaffects competition in markets serving U.S. consumers. This may occur,for example, when an antidumping or countervailing duty case leads to theimposition of additional duties or to resolution under provisions in thelaw that allow for restrictions on the prices or quantities of importedproducts. Foreign imports may also be limited by voluntary export restraintsthat may have been adopted by a foreign government unilaterally at therequest of the U.S. government. The individual or joint conduct of U.S. firms seeking U.S. government protectionfrom foreign competition generally is immune from prosecution under theantitrust laws. Under the <T3>Noerr-Pennington </T3>doctrine,\127\<NOTE/> the courts have construed the Sherman Act_in light of interestsimplicated by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution_not to interferewith individual or collective petitioning of the U.S. federal or stategovernments, even when the government action sought would have an anticompetitiveeffect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ <T3>See </T3>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961); United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington,381 U.S. 657 (1965); and California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited,404 U.S. 508 (1972). The doctrine developed out of these cases is knownas the <T3>Noerr-Pennington </T3>doctrine. Ostensible petitioning conduct is not immune, however, when it is in facta mere sham concealing a direct restraint by the parties. Examples of shampetitioning include, in certain circumstances, the meritless invocationof administrative procedures to delay a competitor's entry or to deny itsaccess to government processes and the deliberate misleading of the governmentduring such administrative proceedings.\128\<NOTE/> The threat to consumer welfare from such abuse may be substantial.Although most litigated findings of sham petitioning have involved a patternof abuse, in appropriate circumstances, a single anticompetitive abuseof governmental processes may suffice. Application of the sham exceptionto the <T3>Noerr-Pennington </T3>doctrine is illustrated in Case 13, which dealswith the filing of a sham patent claim under section 337 of the 1930 TariffAct in order to exclude imports.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ <T3>See </T3>California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, <T3>supra, </T3>n.127, 404 U.S. at 515-516. Since the <T3>Noerr-Pennington </T3>doctrine rests on a construction of the ShermanAct that is derived at least in part by reference to the First Amendmentright to petition, that doctrine may not apply to the petitioning of foreigngovernments by U.S. and foreign firms.\129\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, for reasons of comity, the Department's policyis not to prosecute the legitimate petitioning of foreign governments byforeign or U.S. firms in circumstances in which the United States protectssuch activities by its own citizens. This point is illustrated in Case15, which deals with a foreign government-imposed export restraint.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ <T3>See </T3>Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Buttes Oil andamp; Gas Co., 461F.2d 1261 (9th Cir.) (per curiam), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>409 U.S. 950 (1972); Australia/Eastern U.S.A. ShippingConf. v. United States, 537 F. Supp. 807, 812-13 (D.D.C. 1982). <T3>But See </T3>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, 694 F. 2d 1358,1364-67 (5th Cir. 1983). Of course, the mere involvement of U.S. or foreign government officers,allegations of U.S. trade law violations, or an alleged intention to resolveinternational trade frictions, will not protect naked agreements amongcompetitors to restrict output or fix prices. The U.S. trade laws, forexample, set forth specific procedures for settling disputes under thoselaws. Any agreement among competitors that does not strictly comply withthose procedures may be prosecuted in appropriate cases, perhaps even ascriminal price-fixing. The Department's analysis of agreements made inresponse to trade disputes is illustrated in Case 17. Conclusion The vast majority of international business transactions, like most domestictransactions, do not raise antitrust concerns. One of the purposes of theseGuidelines is to ensure that uncertainty about the Department's enforcementpolicy in international contexts does not cause businesses to limit unobjectionabletransactions or to avoid efficient and productive arrangements that benefitconsumers. At the same time, these Guidelines make plain the Department'scommitment to prosecute naked restraints of trade, such as horizontal price-fixing,bid-rigging, and market allocation, that have no plausible connection toachieving significant integrative efficiencies and almost certainly reduceoutput and/or raise prices to the detriment of U.S. consumer welfare. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part II. Illustrative Cases </ITAG>The following hypothetical case discussions illustrate how the Departmentwould apply the foregoing analysis in seventeen representative fact situations.In most cases, the outcome of the Department's analysis will depend onthe specific facts and circumstances of the case. These hypothetical casediscussions therefore do not provide absolute answers to the factual andeconomic questions the Department would ask in analyzing particular conductand transactions under the antitrust laws. Rather, they are intended toprovide a coherent framework for that analysis. By providing this analyticalframework, the Department hopes to provide U.S. and foreign businesseswith a better understanding of when and why the Department is likely totake antitrust enforcement action in particular cases.Case 1_Foreign Acquisition by a U.S. Firm Alpha Corporation, a U.S. firm that manufactures and sells product X inthe United States, proposes to acquire all of the stock of Beta Corporation,a Japanese firm that also sells X in the United States. X is a piece ofhigh technology hardware that is used in several military and civil aerospaceapplications. There are no known substitutes for X for those applications,and no other known applications for X. Alpha is the largest supplier of X in the United States. It supplies approximately25 percent of all U.S. consumption. Beta, the world's leading producerof X, supplies approximately 15 percent of U.S. consumption. X importsfrom Japan, the European Economic Community (``EEC''), and Brazil collectivelyaccount for approximately 40 percent of current U.S. consumption, and thelevel of X imports from these countries has been rising. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>Because Alpha and Beta are both engaged in commerce in the United States,the proposed acquisition clearly is subject to section 7 of the ClaytonAct, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions that may substantially lessencompetition or tend to create a monopoly ``in any line of commerce . .. in any section of the country.''\130\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ 15 U.S.C. 18 (1982). Section 7 of the Clayton Act appliesto a transaction if the parties are engaged ``in commerce or in any activityaffecting commerce.'' <T3>Id. </T3>An acquisition may also be challenged under section 1 of theSherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 (1982), which prohibits contracts, combinations,and conspiracies ``in restraint of trade or commerce among the severalStates, or with foreign nations.'' An anticompetitive merger may be challengedunder section 1 if it would have a ``direct, substantial and reasonablyforeseeable'' effect on U.S. domestic or import commerce. <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 7 (1982). The Department's substantive analysisis the same under both section 7 and section 1. <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 1. The Department's first step in analyzing the likely competitive effectsof this merger would be to define the relevant market or markets that wouldbe affected by the merger. As discussed in Part I of these Guidelines,a market is formally defined as a group of products or services (``productmarket'') and a geographic area (``geographic market'') as to which a hypotheticalmonopolist (that is, the only current and future seller of a product orservice in an area) could profitably raise price significantly above theprevailing level. <ITAG tagnum="81">Product Market </ITAG>To define the relevant product market (or markets) that would be affectedby this merger, the Department would begin by considering separately eachproduct (narrowly defined) sold by Alpha and Beta in the United States.The Department would then ask what would happen if a hypothetical monopolistof that product imposed a significant and nontransitory increase in price(usually five percent for one year). If the price increase would causeso many buyers to shift to other products that it would not be profitableto impose, then the Department would add to the product group the productthat was the next best substitute and ask the same question again untila group of products had been identified with respect to which a hypotheticalmonopolist would impose a significant and nontransitory price increase.\131\<NOTE/> Ultimately, this process would identify all products withwhich the products sold by Alpha and Beta do or would compete in responseto a significant and nontransitory price increase. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.11. Under some analytical approaches,production substitution (the ability to shift the use of production anddistribution assets from producing and selling one product to producingand selling another) is reflected in the description of the relevant productmarket. The Department, however, defines the relevant product market byreference to demand substitution and accounts for production substitutionwhen it identifies firms in the relevant market. <T3>Id. </T3>at section 2.21 andamp; n.9, and I.B.2., <T3>supra. </T3>Of course, existing buyers might differ in their ability to use particularsubstitute products and the ease with which they could substitute thoseproducts for the product of the merging firms. Therefore, even though anacross-the-board price increase might cause such significant substitutionthat it would not be profitable, if sellers could discriminate in the prices they charged to different groups of buyers, then sellers might beable to raise price only to buyers who could not easily substitute away.If such price discrimination were possible, the Department would considerdefining additional, narrower product markets consisting of particularuses of the product as to which a hypothetical monopolist could exercisemarket power.\132\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.13. Price discrimination requiresthat sellers be able to identify those buyers and that other buyers notbe able profitably to purchase and resell the product to them. <T3>Id. </T3>at n.8. X comprises the relevant product market in this case. Under the facts ofthis case, Alpha and Beta each produce only X, and there are no known substitutesfor X for any group of buyers. <ITAG tagnum="81">Geographic Market </ITAG>After defining the relevant product market, the Department would next definethe relevant geographic market. The purpose of defining a relevant geographicmarket is to establish a geographic boundary that roughly separates producersthat are important factors in the competitive analysis (that is, that wouldundercut collusion) from those that are not. To define the relevant geographic market in this case, the Department wouldbegin by considering Alpha's locations (or the location of each of itsplants) in the United States \133\<NOTE/> and asking what would happen if a hypothetical monopolistimposed a significant and nontransitory increase in the price of X at thatlocation. If so many buyers would shift to X produced in other areas thatthe price increase would not be profitable, then the Department would addthe location from which production would be the next best substitute andask the same question again.\134\<NOTE/> Ultimately, this process would identify all areas, foreignand domestic, in which producers do compete or would compete with Alphain response to a significant and nontransitory increase in the price ofX. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ Because a firm can compete at the same time in a numberof economically discrete geographic markets, it is possible that Alphaand Beta also compete in markets in which U.S. consumers do not participate.For example, they may compete in Japanese markets. Because the Departmentis concerned about U.S. consumer welfare, it would not be concerned aboutthe merger's competitive effects in those markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.31.Although direct evidence of the likely effect of a future price increasemight sometimes be available (for example, in the form of evidence as tohow consumers have responded to price increases in the past), the Departmentnormally would infer that effect from reliable circumstantial evidence.In evaluating geographic substitutability, the Department would considerall relevant evidence, but would give particular weight to shipment patterns,evidence that U.S. consumers had actually considered shifting their purchasesof X to producers located in other areas in response to changes in competitivevariables, differences or similarities in price movements over a periodof years that are not explainable by parallel changes in factors such asthe cost of inputs, transportation and local distribution costs, and excesscapacity of producers outside Alpha's location.\135\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ <T3>Id.</T3> at section 2.32. Of course, buyers might differ in the ease with which they could shiftto products produced outside of Alpha's location. As in the case of productmarket definition, if sellers could discriminate in the prices they chargedto buyers in different locations, then the Department would consider definingadditional, narrower geographic markets in which a hypothetical monopolistcould exercise market power.\136\<NOTE/> Geographic price discrimination against a group of buyersis more likely to occur when other buyers cannot easily purchase and resellthe  relevant product to the group of buyers. Such arbitrage is particularlydifficult where the product is sold on a delivered basis and where transportationcosts are a significant percentage of the final cost.\137\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 2.33. A U.S. Department of Defense requirementthat contractors use X produced in the United States would preclude U.S.contractors from shifting to X produced outside the United States in responseto a price increase in the United States, at least for military applications.Foreign-produced X might still be a supply alternative for civilian aerospaceapplications of X, however. If that were the case, the Department wouldlikely define a national market for the sale of X for U.S. military applicationsand a second market for the sale of X for civilian applications (whichmight be an international market), unless producers of X were unable todiscriminate in the price they charged to purchasers for military use andpurchasers for civilian use.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ <T3>Id. </T3>at n.11. In this case, the facts that Beta and other producers in Japan, the EEC,and Brazil currently account for approximately 40 percent of X consumptionin the United States and X imports from those countries have been risingsuggest that U.S. consumers would shift to X produced by firms in thoseareas in response to a price increase in the United States. This wouldnot necessarily be true in all cases where there are some imports, however.For example, foreign firms might have difficulty establishing reputationsfor quality and service and/or distribution and marketing networks in theUnited States that would be necessary to expand their sales, they mightalready be operating at full capacity, or exchange rates might be unfavorable.Foreign firms may also be prevented by trade restraints from expandingtheir sales in the United States. Such restraints, however, would not causeforeign competitors to be excluded from the relevant market. Instead, theeffect of such restraints in limiting the supply response of foreign firmswould be considered in assigning market shares to affected foreign firmsand in interpreting market share and market concentration data. As explainedin greater detail in Case 2 of these Guidelines, the Department would heavilydiscount existing imports by foreign firms if import restraints would preventthose firms from responding to a price increase in the United States. Assumingno significant incidence of arbitrage, the inclusion of actual import salesin the market could significantly overstate the competitive check providedby foreign firms and, therefore, understate the likelihood of anticompetitivepricing following the merger. <ITAG tagnum="81">Identifying Firms in the Relevant Market </ITAG>The Department would include in the relevant market all firms that currentlysell X in the market plus all firms that could easily and economicallybegin selling X in the relevant market using existing production and distributionfacilities within one year of a significant price increase.\138\<NOTE/> It is important to note that firms that could readily converttheir facilities to produce X within one year might nevertheless find itdifficult to market or distribute X in the United States, or for some otherreason might find the substitution to be  unprofitable. The Departmentwould not include those firms in the relevant market. The Department might,however, consider their competitive significance (along with the competitivesignificance of firms that would not be included in the market becausethey must construct significant new facilities) in evaluating the likelihoodof new entry in response to a domestic price increase.\139\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ <T3>See</T3> Merger Guidelines section 2.21. Firms that would need to makesignificant modifications to existing facilities or to construct new facilitiesto produce and sell X would not be included in the relevant market. Theirrole in constraining an anticompetitive price increase would be consideredin evaluating ease of entry into the relevant market generally. <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.21. <ITAG tagnum="81">Assigning Market Shares </ITAG>The Department normally would include in the relevant market the totalsales or total capacity of all domestic firms (or plants) in the market,unless the facts indicated that total sales or capacity would overstatethe competitive significance of a particular firm or group of firms.\140\<NOTE/> If some portion of a firm's output would not be used to respondto a price increase (because it was already contractually committed, forexample), then the Department might exclude that portion of the firm'soutput from the market.\141\<NOTE/> Market shares would be expressed either in dollar terms (throughthe measurement of sales, shipments, or production), or in physical  terms(through the measurement of sales, shipments, production, capacity, orreserves). As a practical matter, the availability of data would determinewhich measurement base the Department used. If it had a choice, however,the Department would use dollar sales or shipments if X was a branded orrelatively differentiated product. It would use capacity, production, orreserves if X was a relatively homogeneous and undifferentiated product.\142\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ <T3>See id.</T3> at section 2.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ <T3>Id. </T3>Whether and to what extent the Department would exclude suchoutput from the market would depend on the extent to which that outputcould either be resold to buyers in the relevant market or would free upthe output of other producers to be sold in the relevant market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.4. As to foreign firms, if market shares generally were to be assigned onthe basis of dollar sales or shipments, the Department would count in themarket dollar sales in,\143\<NOTE/> or shipments to, the relevant market. If market shares generallywere to be assigned on the basis of capacity, reserves, or production,the Department would count in the market foreign capacity, reserves, orproduction likely to be devoted to the relevant market in response to aprice increase.\144\<NOTE/> Total foreign capacity would not be counted in the marketif a foreign firm lacked specialized distribution facilities needed   tosupply additional demand in the United States. In addition, the Departmentmight use current shipments for foreign firms if the Department were unableto obtain adequate data to quantify reliably the amount of capacity, reserves,or production that would be devoted to the United States in response toa price increase.\145\<NOTE/> Finally, the Department might assign a single, aggregatemarket share to a country or group of countries if there were insufficientdata available to allocate shares between individual firms or if firmsin that country or group of countries coordinated their production or salesinto the United States.\146\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ If varying exchange rates made comparable dollar calculationsfor firms in different countries difficult, the Department might use unitvolume sales instead of dollar sales. <T3>Id. </T3>at section 2.4 andamp; n.12. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ The Department's treatment of import quotas that constrainthe ability of foreign producers to increase their exports to the UnitedStates is discussed in Case 2 of these Guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\146\ <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">Interpreting and Assessing Market Data </ITAG>In some circumstances, current market shares calculated as described abovemay still either overstate or understate the competitive significance offoreign firms.

A merger in a highly concentrated market may resultin absolutely no ability to exercise market power if any attempt to restrictoutput and/or raise price would be frustrated by new entry or expansionby fringe firms or if other factors would make successful collusion implausible.\152\<NOTE/> In addition, efficiencies that could only be achieved throughthe merger may be so great that, despite its anticompetitive potential,the merger's net effect would be to benefit U.S. consumer welfare. Theparties to the merger would have the burden of establishing such efficiencieson the basis of clear and convincing evidence.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines sections 3.3, 3.4; <T3>see also </T3>discussion at I.B.2., <T3>supra. </T3>In considering whether efficiencies justify condoning an otherwise potentiallyanticompetitive merger, the Department would compare the estimated costsavings from the claimed efficiencies (less the cost of consolidating theoperations of the merging firms) against the expected harm to competitionthat might result from the merger. In general, the Department would requirea greater level of expected efficiencies as the level of anticompetitiverisks posed by the merger increased. The Department would consider suchefficiencies as economies of scale, better integration of production facilities,plant specialization, and lower transportation costs. The Department wouldalso consider the reduction of general selling, administrative and overheadexpenses, although these types of efficiencies, as a practical matter,would be more difficult to prove. The Department would not consider claimedefficiencies if comparable savings reasonably could be achieved throughother, less anticompetitive, means.Case 2_Merger Analysis Involving Trade Restraints The facts of this case are the same as the facts in Case 1, plus the followingfacts. Japanese producers of X are subject to a voluntary export restraint(``VER'') limiting the quantity of their X exports to the United States.Shipments from the EEC are subject to binding U.S. import quotas, someof which limit X imports to a fixed quantity (i.e., fixed quotas), andsome of which limit X imports to a percentage of U.S. production (i.e.,percentage quotas). X imports from Brazil are subject to a tariff thatwas imposed as a result of a countervailing duty proceeding under the U.S.trade laws. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>The VER, quotas, and tariff would affect the way the Department assignsand interprets market shares and market concentration data in this case.Foreign competitors would not be excluded from the relevant market solelybecause their sales in the United States are subject to quotas or VERs.That is because it is difficult to assess the effectiveness and longevityof such restraints and to measure the likely offsetting supply responsesof producers that are not subject to the restraints. A restraint that appliedonly to the EEC, for example, might have only a limited effect on the extentof foreign competition faced by domestic firms if non-EEC firms could readilyshift shipments to the United States from countries that do not limit EECimports or if they could purchase X from EEC firms and resell it in theUnited States. Given the limitations on available data, it often is impossibleto quantify the precise effect of trade restraints. Nevertheless, the Department would recognize in this case that Japaneseand EEC firms that are subject to an effective and binding restraint \153\<NOTE/> could not increase their shipments to the United States inresponse to a price increase by domestic producers. They therefore couldnot constrain a domestic price increase. In fact, in the case of an effective,binding percentage quota, a reduction in domestic production would actuallylead to reduced imports by foreign firms subject to the quota, making successfulcollusion among domestic firms more likely.\154\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ An ``effective'' trade restraint is one that cannotbe substantially avoided through diversion and arbitrage. A trade restraintis ``binding'' if firms would sell more than the restraint ceiling if therestraint did not exist. A restraint is not binding if, for example, althoughit would allow firms to ship 100 units of a product to the United States,those firms currently ship only 60 units.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ Merger Guidelines at section 3.23. The Department would consider the supply-restraining effect of the EECquotas and Japanese VER in assigning market shares and interpreting marketshare and market concentration data. First, the Department would not assignto the EEC and Japanese firms market shares that exceeded the level ofshipments that the quotas or VER permitted those firms to make.\155\<NOTE/> Second, the Department would consider the impact of the quotasand VER in assessing the significance of market concentration data calculatedon the basis of those market shares.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\155\ <T3>Id. </T3>at section 2.4.  To the extent that actual sales or shipments by EEC and Japanese firmsoverstated their future competitive significance because the restraintslimited the ability of those firms to expand shipments in response to aprice increase in the United States, concentration data based on thosesales or shipments would tend to understate the risk of anticompetitiveharm. For example, if a cartel of domestic producers restricted their outputof X in order to drive up prices in the United States, EEC firms boundby the percentage quota would be forced to reduce their U.S. shipmentsalong with the domestic cartel. Therefore, although EEC firms would beassigned market shares up to the amount permitted to be shipped to theUnited States under the current quota level, their competitive significancewould be heavily discounted.\156\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\156\ In the extreme siluation where there was an effective,binding trade restraint that placed a fixed or percentage limitation onimports from all or virtually all foreign sources, foreign firms wouldusually be accorded little, if any, competitive significance in the Department'sanalysis. <T3>Id. </T3>at section 3.23 andamp; n.19. Similarly, if the VER in this case would prevent Japanese firms from expandingtheir shipments to the United States, current U.S. sales by Japanese firmswould tend to overstate their competitive significance. This does not meanthat the Department would discount Beta's market share, however. The purposeof discounting the market shares of foreign firms that are subject to importrestraints is to recognize that those firms would not inhibit the exerciseof market power by domestic firms. A merger between Alpha and Beta, onthe other hand, would increase the likelihood of successful collusion bydomestic firms by making such collusion more profitable_following the merger,a domestic cartel would control a greater percentage of sales in the relevantmarket. If Brazilian firms have been shipping X subject to the tariff into theUnited States, the tariff by itself would not likely inhibit Brazilianproducers in responding to a significant and nontransitory price increasein the United States. If the tariff were prohibitive, however, such thatBrazilian firms were not currently selling in the United States, then thosefirms would be included in the market only if a price increase would makeshipments to the United States under the tariff profitable.Case 3_Acquisition of a Foreign Potential Competitor The facts of this case are the same as the facts in Case 1, except thatneither Beta Corporation nor any other foreign producer of X currentlysells X in the United States. It is assumed that the geographic scope ofthe relevant market is limited to the United States. It is further assumedthat it would take Beta at least 18 months to establish sufficient distributionfacilities to begin selling X in the United States, if it chose to do so.\157\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\157\ Firms that could easily and economically begin sellingin the United States within one year of a significant and nontransitoryprice increase would be included as competitors in the relevant market.<T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2.21. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>Because Beta does not compete in the U.S. market for X, this merger couldhave a significant anticompetitive effect only if Beta would enter themarket independently in the near future if it did not merge with Alpha,\158\<NOTE/> the U.S. market for X were very highly concentrated, andBeta were one of only a very few other firms capable of entering the U.S.market for X in response to an anticompetitive price increase. Even ifthe U.S. market for X were very highly concentrated, eliminating only oneof several potential entrants would not have any significant anticompetitiveeffect.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\158\ Applying a more speculative test would insulate inefficientmanagement from the threat of takeover without necessarily inducing independententry and would thus lead to decreased consumer welfare. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>B.A.T. Indus. Ltd., [1983-1987 Transfer Binder-FTCComplaints and Orders] (CCH) andpara; 22,218 (FTC Dec. 17, 1984). In determining whether Beta actually would enter the U.S. market for Xindependently (or through a ``toe-hold'' acquisition) but for this merger,the Department would consider evidence that Beta actually intended to enterthe market (including, for example, internal management studies, expansionplans, actual investments and other steps toward entry), past attemptsby Beta to enter the market, and whether independent entry would be profitable.Even if Beta would enter the U.S. market for X independently if it didnot merge with Alpha, the Department would be concerned about the competitiveimpact of the merger only if the U.S. market for X were very highly concentrated(that is, if the HHI exceeded 1800).\159\<NOTE/> In that case, the Department would ask whether Beta was oneof only a very few firms capable of entering the market (for example, becausefew or no other firms possessed technology needed to enter the market).If that were the case, then the Department would consider whether the mergerwould result in significant integrative efficiencies that could only beachieved through the merger and that would outweigh any threat of anticompetitiveharm to U.S. consumers.\160\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\159\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 4. Even in that case, the Departmentwould not likely challenge the merger if Alpha had a market share of fivepercent or less (i.e., if it were a ``toe-hold'' merger). Given the insignificantrole that small firms usually play in collusive interactions, a mergerbetween a potential entrant and a firm with only five percent of the marketmay have the same competitive effect as new entry and may, in effect, merelyconvert a fringe firm into a significant competitive factor in the market.<T3>Id </T3>at section 4.134. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ <T3>Id. at </T3>section 3.5. <T3>See also </T3>discussion of efficiencies, <T3>supra, </T3>at I.B.2.Case 4_Merger of Two Foreign Firms Beta Corporation and Delta Corporation are among the leading diversifiedelectronics companies in Country A. They are the two most significant producersoutside the United States of product X, a highly advanced and expensiveelectronic device with important and unique capabilities. Both companies'facilities for producing X are located in Country A. Beta and Delta togethersupply approximately 60 percent of X consumption in the United States,accounting for more than $110 million in sales. Each company has at least$15 million (book value) in assets located in the United States, althoughnone of those assets are used to produce or sell X. Beta and Delta eachmake X sales in the United States through agreements with independent distributors.Beta has announced that it intends to purchase all of the stock of Delta.After conducting a preliminary investigation, the Department has determinedthat there is a relevant U.S. market for the sale of X that includes Betaand Delta as sellers. That market is highly concentrated (the post-mergerHHI would significantly exceed 1800 points), and concentration will increasesubstantially as a result of the merger (i.e., by more than 100 HHI points).It therefore appears that the merger may have an anticompetitive effectin the United States unless other factors, such as ease of entry into themarket, would make the exercise of market power unlikely or unless efficienciesresulting from the merger would offset any potential anticompetitive effect.Although both Beta and Delta also sell other products in the United States,it does not appear that the merger could have an anticompetitive effectwith respect to any of those other products. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>Because Beta and Delta both sell X in the United States, the merger clearlyis subject to section 7 of the Clayton Act. The Department's Merger Guidelinesexplain when the Department ordinarily would challenge a merger or acquisitionunder section 7. That analysis is described in Part I.B.2., supra, andis illustrated in Cases 1, 2, and 3. The U.S. antitrust laws represent a fundamental and important nationalpolicy that generally must be protected when U.S. commerce is significantlyaffected, even when doing so requires bringing an enforcement action againstconduct or transactions that occur outside the United States. Nevertheless,applying the U.S. antitrust laws to such conduct or transactions can sometimesconflict with the legitimate interests of other nations. As a matter ofcomity and in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, the Departmentconsiders such interests in deciding whether to challenge a transactioninvolving foreign firms.\161\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ Indeed, the United States is committed to consideringthe legitimate interests of other nations in accordance with recommendationsof the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) andbilateral agreements with several foreign governments. <T3>See </T3>n.1, <T3>supra. </T3>The Department would not challenge the merger in this case, notwithstandingany possible anticompetitive effect the merger might have on U.S. commerce.Since both of the merging firms are foreign and all of their assets involvedin producing and distributing X are located outside the United States,it would be very difficult, if not practically impossible, to obtain effectiverelief that would preserve competition in the United States. This does not mean that the Department would never challenge a merger betweenforeign firms that would have a substantial anticompetitive effect in theUnited States, however. The Department might reach a different conclusionin this case, for example, if either Alpha or Beta had facilities usedto produce X located in the United States, even though both had their corporateheadquarters and most of their assets outside the United States. In thatcase, the Department would probably request additional information concerningthe likely competitive effects of the merger, using procedures under theHart-Scott-Rodino Act, CIDs, or informal requests, as appropriate. If theDepartment concluded after reviewing such information that the merger wouldbe anticompetitive, then the Department would likely challenge the merger.If X production facilities belonging to Alpha or Beta located in the UnitedStates would constitute a viable business standing alone or if acquiredby another company, the merger might be permitted to go forward conditionedon the divestiture of all or a portion of those facilities to a suitablebuyer approved by the Department. The Department might seek the views ofthe government of Country A concerning the impact of various alternativeremedies on that country's national interests. <ITAG tagnum="81">Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification Requirements </ITAG>Foreign firms that have all of their assets used to produce and sell therelevant product located outside of the United States (and the merger ofwhich therefore would not be subject to challenge by the Department underthe foregoing analysis) might still be required by the Hart-Scott-RodinoAct to file premerger notification with the Department and the FTC. Anacquisition by one foreign corporation of the stock of another foreigncorporation is exempt from the premerger notification requirements of thatAct only if (i) the acquisition would not confer control of a U.S. issuerhaving annual net sales or total assets of $25 million or more, or of anyissuer with assets located in the United States having a book value of$15 million or more; or (ii) aggregate annual net sales of the mergingfirms in the United States are less than $110 million and the aggregatebook value of their assets in the United States is less than $110 million.\162\<NOTE/> In this case, neither exception is satisfied. The acquisitionof Delta's stock would give Beta control over Delta's assets in the UnitedStates, which have a book value of more than $15 million, and the combinedU.S. sales of Beta and Delta exceed $110 million. The parties would thereforebe required to file premerger notification under the Hart-Scott-RodinoAct. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\162\ <T3>See </T3>16 CFR 802.51.Case 5_Joint Bidding Several U.S. electrical equipment manufacturers and engineering firms haveestablished a consortium for the purpose of submitting a bid on an extremelylarge project in Country A to develop a nationwide system of hydroelectricpower plants. The consortium includes three of the ten largest U.S. equipmentmanufacturers and three of the ten largest U.S. engineering firms. No otherAmerican or foreign firms have been invited to join the consortium. Foursimilar consortia supported by the Japanese, British, Korean, and Germangovernments, respectively, are also preparing bids. The U.S. parties have formed the consortium because a smaller group wouldnot have the technical capabilities needed to carry out the project anda substantial portion of most members' resources is already committed tocontracts for sales and construction work in the United States and othercountries. The project will require at least ten years to complete. Country A is financing the project through a 30-year loan from the UnitedStates government. The interest rate on the loan is substantially belowthe current commercial rate of lending and payments on the loan do notcome due until the fifteenth year. As a result, the present value of theexpected future repayment of the loan is less than half of the value ofthe project. Because of the importance of this project, several seniorU.S. government officials have been strong supporters of the U.S. consortium.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>This case involves issues of joint venture analysis. As discussed in PartI.B.3., joint ventures often play an important role in promoting the growthand international competitiveness of the U.S. economy by achieving significantintegrative efficiencies and adding new capacity to the market. Legitimatejoint ventures_those that involve significant economic integration of members'operations beyond the mere coordination of their pricing and output decisions_arejudged under a rule-of-reason analysis. Only those joint ventures thatcreate anticompetitive risks that are not outweighed by substantial efficienciesresulting from the joint venture are proscribed. Normally, the Departmentwould not be concerned about this consortium's effect on competition foran overseas project.\163\<NOTE/> In the absence of U.S. government funding (discussed below),the Department would not challenge a joint venture_or even outright bid-rigging_byU.S. firms on a purely foreign project on the basis of the competitiveeffects of such conduct in a foreign market.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\163\ <T3>But see </T3>discussion of potential ``spill-over'' effects in marketsin which U.S. consumers participate, <T3>infra. </T3>In this case, however, the U.S. government is substantially funding theoverseas project through a noncommercial rate loan.\164\<NOTE/> As a general matter, the Department considers there to bea sufficient effect on U.S. interests to support the assertion of jurisdictionwhere, as a result of its payment or financing, the U.S. government bearsmore than half of the cost of the transaction.\165\<NOTE/> In that case, any anticompetitive conduct with respect tothe transaction would have the primary effect of harming U.S. taxpayers.In this case, since the present value of the expected future repaymentof the loan is less than half the value of the transaction, more than halfof the cost of the transaction is being borne by the U.S. government. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\164\ <T3>See e.g., </T3>United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n,393 U.S. 199 (1968) (exports funded by U.S. AID Program were not ``exports''under Webb-Pomerene Act and were thus subject to the Sherman Act); <T3>see also </T3>United States v. Standard Tallow Corp., 1988-1 TradeCas. (CCH) andpara; 67,913 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (sales of tallow to Egyptian governmentfunded by U.S. AID Program). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\165\ For the purpose of determining when more than half ofthe cost of a transaction is borne by the U.S. government, the Departmentapplies the standards used to determine whether export conduct is eligiblefor certification under the Export Trading Company Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C.4011-4021 (1982). <T3>See </T3>ETC Guidelines, 50 FR at 1799-1800. The requisite U.S. governmentinvolvement could include the actual purchase of goods by the U.S. governmentfor shipment abroad, a U.S. government grant to a foreign government thatis specifically earmarked for the transaction, or a U.S. government loanspecifically earmarked for the transaction that is made on such generousterms that it amounts to a grant. U.S. government interests would not besufficiently implicated with respect to a transaction that is funded byan international agency for which the U.S. government does not supply amajor portion of funding or a transaction in which the foreign governmentreceives non-earmarked funds from the United States as part of a generalgovernment-to-government aid program. Assuming that the U.S. government is funding the project, the initial questionin this case is whether the consortium is a legitimate joint venture thatshould be analyzed under a rule of reason, or a naked restraint of tradethat should be treated as per se unlawful. This consortium would be treatedas per se illegal if it were a sham designed to disguise naked bid-rigging.There is no reason to believe that the consortium in this case is a sham,however. The consortium appears to be intended to achieve legitimate integrativeefficiencies. It does not simply eliminate competition among consortiummembers; rather, it enables them to compete more effectively against otherconsortia by combining complementary assets.\166\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ Such a sham might exist if the consortium members hadoriginally intended to bid separately but agreed to bid collectively inorder to hold the bids down and then to allow one pair of engineering firmand equipment manufacturer to perform the contract and provide some quidpro quo to the other members. The true intention of the parties would becovert and the consortium would be merely diversionary. The consortiumwould not have been formed to achieve efficiencies from the economic integrationof the parties' operations; rather, its goal would have been to reducecompetition among the bidders. <ITAG tagnum="81">Step 1_Joint Venture Market </ITAG>If, as in this case, the joint bidding consortium was not a sham, the Departmentwould first determine whether the consortium would have an anticompetitiveeffect in the market in which the consortium will compete. It appears fromthe facts of this case that no single consortium member or smaller groupcould be a credible bidder on the project. If that were true, then theconsortium would not eliminate any competition among bidders and this casewould raise no antitrust concern with respect to competition for the project(although, as discussed below, the Department might be concerned aboutanticompetitive spill-over effects in U.S. markets). If the consortium did eliminate competition among its members (that is,if some subset of the consortium could credibly have bid on the project),then the Department would analyze the consortium's competitive effectsas though the consortium were a merger of the consortium members in themarket in which the consortium will compete. Assuming that the consortiumwill compete only for the project in this case, the relevant market wouldlikely be defined as the group of consortia willing and able to performthe project. As in merger analysis, the Department would focus first on the level ofconcentration in the market after the consortium is formed and the increasein concentration as a result of forming the consortium. If each of thefive bidding consortia is a comparable participant in the market (thatis, if each faces comparable costs and is equally able to perform the contract),then the Department would consider each of the consortia to be equal insize and competitive significance. The Department would measure concentration in the market by dividing thenumber of bidders into one and multiplying by 10,000 (the HHI of a single-firmmarket).\167\<NOTE/> If a single team of one U.S. engineering firm and one U.S.equipment manufacturer could credibly bid on and perform the project, forexample, then the consortium would reduce the number of bidders in themarket from seven (three U.S. bidding consortia and four foreign biddingconsortia) to five. Market concentration with seven bidders would be approximately1428, and market concentration with five bidders would be 2000 and an increasein concentration of more than 50 points. The consortium would result ina highly concentrated market.\168\<NOTE/> The Department would therefore proceed to consider otherrelevant factors bearing on the likelihood that the U.S. consortium wouldbe anticompetitive. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ If the U.S consortium would continue to compete on otherU.S. government funded projects and/or projects in the United States, thenthe Department's analysis might be different. For example, if potentialcompeting bidders were capacity-constrained, such that they would not beavailable to compete on all projects, then the Department would have totake that into account in assigning market shares and measuring concentrationin the relevant market. The Department would also likely be more concernedwith the possibility of anticompetitive collusion if there were many repeatedbidding opportunities, since in that case it might be easier to coordinatea bid-rigging cartel. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ <T3>See </T3>n.58, <T3>supra.</T3>In particular, the Department would determine whether there were many otherpotential bidders for the hydroelectric power plant project. A market maybe competitive even if there are only five, or even two, actual biddersif there is a large pool of potential bidders. The number of actual biddersmay be limited by the costs of bidding (e.g., the cost of forming the consortium,formulating the bid, and, perhaps, qualifying to bid). If the costs ofbidding are substantial, then only a few potential bidders would be expectedto bid on a given project. The Department would therefore not be concernedabout the U.S. consortium in this case if it appeared that there were manyother potential bidders that could have competed for the project; fivebidders would simply be the market's optimal number of actual bidders.Although the analysis of this consortium may seem complex, it is usefulto keep two points in mind. First, if the project were purely foreign,without the involvement of substantial U.S. government funding, then theDepartment would not challenge the consortium regardless of the circumstances.Second, even if antitrust analysis were required because of, for example,substantial U.S. government funding, it would often be clear that a particularjoint venture is reasonably required to maximize the competitiveness ofthe joint venture members. <ITAG tagnum="81">Step 2_Spill-Over Markets </ITAG>The Department would next determine whether the consortium or any of itsancillary restraints would likely have any anticompetitive ``spill-over''effects in other markets in which the consortium members do or would compete.Under certain circumstances, the consortium in this case might facilitatecollusion among members with respect to the price and/or output of electricalequipment or engineering services or on bidding for projects in the UnitedStates. In formulating the consortium's bid, for example, consortium membersmight exchange sensitive business information that could be used to coordinateprices or output in the United States. Such spill-over effects may be of no concern if none of the informationthe consortium members might share about the hydroelectric power plantproject in Country A would be relevant to competition among consortiummembers in the United States, or if the consortium included safeguardsagainst anticompetitive spill-over effects resulting from the exchangeof sensitive information. For example, the consortium might include safeguardsdesigned to prevent the disclosure of sensitive business information topersons that are actively engaged in managing the competitive activitiesof individual consortium members in spill-over markets.\169\<NOTE/> Of course, even   if such safeguards were not used, the consortiumwould raise no significant concerns if the relevant spill-over market werenot concentrated, the consortium members represented a small share of thespill-over market, entry into the spill-over market were easy, or otherfactors would make successful collusion in the spill-over market unlikely.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\169\ <T3>See </T3>nn.75-80 and accompanying text, <T3>supra.</T3> The existence of such safeguards, of course, would notpreclude the Department from prosecuting any unlawful agreement that resultednotwithstanding such precautions (perhaps because the parties failed toobserve safeguards). If the consortium did raise any significant antitrust concern, the informalencouragement given to the consortium or its members by U.S. governmentofficials would not confer any kind of antitrust immunity. If bidding consortiaand other joint ventures engaged in exporting goods or services desiregreater certainty about their potential antitrust liability, they can seekto obtain a business review from the Department or a certificate of reviewunder the Export Trading Company Act.\170\<NOTE/> Export conduct is not eligible for certification under theExport Trading Company Act, however, if the U.S. government bears morethan half the cost of purchasing the exported goods or services. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\170\ 28 CFR 50.6 and 15 U.S.C. 4011-4021 (1982). <ITAG tagnum="81">Case 6_Research and Development Joint Venture </ITAG>The first, third, and fourth largest producers of X-metal in the UnitedStates, which supply 35, 15, and 10 percent of U.S. X-metal consumption,respectively, have entered into an agreement with Beta Corporation, a Britishcompany that is one of the largest X-metal producers in the EEC. The partiesplan to engage in joint Randamp;D to develop a process for producing X-metalfrom sources other than the traditionally used X-ore. X is found in a varietyof shales located throughout the world, but no one has found an economicalway to produce X from these shales. Beta and several X-metal producers,including each of the U.S. parties to the agreement, are independentlyengaged in laboratory research activities. So far, none of this researchhas yielded a workable process or shown any promise of doing so. Under the agreement, the parties will form a British company. Each partywill own one-fourth of the shares of this company, and each will designateone-fourth of the members of the board of directors. Each of the venturemembers has agreed to conduct all of its Randamp;D activities devoted toseeking new processes for producing X-metal from shale through this newBritish company. They have also agreed to provide the company with pastand projected price and cost data relating to their production and saleof X-metal from X-ore.

Beta will begiven similar rights to patents and know-how in the United Kingdom, otherEEC countries, and all the British Commonwealth countries except Canada.The U.S. parties have agreed not to market X-metal produced using licensedtechnology in territory reserved to Beta. Beta has agreed not to sell X-metalproduced using licensed technology in North America. <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion </ITAG>As is the case with all international agreements, the Department's reviewof the agreement in this case would focus on the agreement's likely competitiveeffects in the United States. Although the joint venture's activities willbe conducted overseas by the new British company, the agreement will directlyaffect Randamp;D competition among firms that do or could produce and sellX-metal in the United States, as well as the sale of X-metal in the UnitedStates by Beta.\171\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ Both section 7 of the Clayton Act and section 1 of theSherman Act would apply to the formation of this joint Randamp;D venturebecause of the acquisition of shares of the new British company, a personwhose activities at least ``affect'' U.S. commerce. 15 U.S.C. 18. In addition,the licensing of technology produced by the joint venture to U.S. firmswould occur ``in commerce.'' The formation of the joint venture may besubject to the premerger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-RodinoAct. <T3>See</T3> 16 CFR 801.40.The agreement in this case involves both horizontal and vertical restraints.First, the agreement to coordinate the Randamp;D efforts of the parties shouldbe analyzed as a joint venture that eliminates competition among horizontalcompetitors in a relevant Randamp;D market. The licensing agreement shouldbe analyzed as a vertical restraint.<T3>Joint Venture Analysis. </T3>Joint Randamp;D activities often have substantialprocompetitive effects by promoting the development of new technologies,products, and processes that otherwise would not be available and thatcould substantially improve the efficiency of firms serving U.S. consumers.The specific benefits that can be derived from joint Randamp;D include sharingthe often substantial economic risks involved in Randamp;D; increasing theefficiency of Randamp;D efforts by exploiting economies of scale or scopebeyond what individual firms could realize, or by pooling important informationor complementary skills; and overcoming the ``free-rider'' disincentiveto invest in Randamp;D by including likely end-users of the Randamp;D in undertakingthe research efforts and sharing the costs. An Randamp;D joint venture canalso provide a low-cost means of transmitting information created by theventure, minimizing transactions costs, and allowing venture members touse information at its actual zero marginal cost.<T3>NCRA. </T3>Congress formally recognized the procompetitive benefitsof joint Randamp;D when it enacted the National Cooperative Research Actof 1984 (``NCRA'').\172\<NOTE/> The NCRA, among other things, prohibits courts from comdemninga joint Randamp;D venture on antitrust grounds unless the joint venture isproven to have anticompetitive effects in a properly defined, relevantmarket that outweigh the joint venture's procompetitive benefits.\173\<NOTE/> The NCRA also limits the monetary relief that may be obtainedin civil suits challenging conduct that is within the scope of notificationfiled by the joint Randamp;D venture with the Attorney General and the FTC.\174\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\172\ Pub.

Joint Randamp;D ventures within thescope of the notification also can recover attorneys' fees expended insuccessfully defending against a private antitrust suit.The NCRA includes in the definition of joint Randamp;D the patenting andlicensing of the results of an Randamp;D joint venture. It excludes (i) anyexchange of competitively sensitive information among competitors ``thatis not reasonably required to conduct the research and development thatis the purpose'' of the venture; (ii) any agreement or conduct restrictingcompetition among venture members with respect to producing or marketingproducts, processes, or services other than the intellectual property (e.g.,patents or know-how developed through the joint venture; or (iii) any agreementor conduct restricting the sale, licensing, or sharing of intellectualproperty developed outside the joint venture or restricting or requiringparticipation in other Randamp;D activities that is ``not reasonably requiredto prevent misappropriation of proprietary information'' that is contributedby any joint venture member or that results from the joint venture.\175\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\175\ 15 U.S.C. 4301(b).Conduct excluded from application of the NCRA is not necessarily unlawful,of course.

On the other hand, theexistence of possible anticompetitive effects does not automatically condemnthe joint venture. The risk of anticompetitive effects must be weighedagainst any likely procompetitive benefits of the joint venture. As Congresshas recognized, as a general matter, the greater the cost of Randamp;D relativeto a single firm's budgetary limits, or the greater the economies of scalethat can be achieved through the jointly conducted Randamp;D, the more likelyis that the procompetitive benefits of joint Randamp;D activity will outweighany potential anticompetitive effects.\178\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\177\ This assumes, of course, that the Randamp;D venture andits collateral restraints represent a legitimate integration of effortsto produce valuable Randamp;D.

A collateraljoint venture restraint that merely fixed the price of goods as to whichthe technology was of no importance or of only trivial importance to efficientproduction of those goods would also not be lawful.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\178\ House Conf. Rep. No. 1044, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess., 1984.As described in Part I of these Guidelines, the Department applies a two-steprule-of-reason analysis to Randamp;D joint ventures.\179\<NOTE/> First, the Department considers whether the joint venturewould have a significant anticompetitive effect in the relevant marketor markets in which the ventures will compete. Second, the Department considerswhether the joint venture would serve as a mechanism to coordinate therestriction of output in other markets in which the venture members competeor might compete.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.3., <T3>supra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="81">Step 1_Joint Venture Markets</ITAG>Applying the principles set forth in the Department's Merger Guidelines,\180\<NOTE/> the Department would first identify the relevant Randamp;Dmarket and firms competing in that market. The Department would includein the relevant Randamp;D market all firms that, judged objectively, havethe incentive and ability, either alone or cooperatively, to undertakeRandamp;D comparable to the Randamp;D proposed to be undertaken by the jointventure in this case. The Department would consider, among other things,such firms' business objectives, facilities, existing technologies andtechnologies under development, and other relevant available assets. Firmswould not have to be competitors in producing or selling X-metal to beincluded in the relevant Randamp;D market. Moreover, because of the mobilenature of information, foreign Randamp;D competitors would probably be significantcompetitive factors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\ <T3>See </T3>Merger Guidelines section 2 and Cases 1, 2, and 3.The Department generally would consider all possible comparable Randamp;Defforts to be equal in size and competitive significance. As a generalrule, an anticompetitive effect is unlikely where there are at least fourcomparable Randamp;D efforts underway or where there is a substantial potentialfor such efforts by firms or groups of firms included in the market. Whilethe actual or potential existence of four comparable Randamp;D efforts createsa ``safe harbor,'' however, the fact that there are fewer than four actualor potential Randamp;D competitors does not necessarily mean that a particularRandamp;D joint venture is anticompetitive. Fewer Randamp;D competitors mayprovide adequate competition, particularly if the joint venture memberscan conduct Randamp;D outside of the joint venture. Moreover, a joint venturethat includes a large portion or even all of the competitors in an Randamp;Dmarket may be necessary in a particular case for successful Randamp;D.\181\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\ House Conf. Rep. No. 1044, <T3>supra</T3> n. 178.Even if a merger of the joint venture members would give them the powerto restrict the output of Randamp;D, a joint venture may pose less anticompetitiverisk than a complete merger. In this case, the venture members are precludedfrom engaging outside the joint venture in Randamp;D into X-metal extractionfrom shale; however, they can continue to compete in the production ofX-metal using other processes. Similarly, because the firms retain theirindependent management, the coordination necessary by the venture membersto exercise market power would be more difficult than in the case of anoutright merger.Moreover, the restriction on the venturers' ability to engage in competingRandamp;D is reasonably necessary to the successful operation of the venture,and the Department would weigh the potential anticompetitive effects ofthis restriction against its procompetitive benefits. The restriction isprobably designed to avoid the threat that a venture member would ``freeride'' on the venture's efforts. Such free-riding could occur if a memberused information provided by others to the joint venture in that member'sown private Randamp;D efforts and did not share the benefits of the Randamp;Dwith other venture members. Without this restriction, firms might be reluctantto disclose information to the venture, thus significantly impeding thesuccess of the venture.<T3>Step 2_Spill-Over Markets.</T3> Next, the Department would determinewhether the venture would likely have any anticompetitive spill-over effectsin product or service markets in which the joint venture members currentlycompete. In this case, the venture members' exchange of competitively sensitiveprice and cost data relating to their X-metal production using existingtechnology might conceivably facilitate collusion with respect to the saleof X-metal unless adequate safeguards were implemented to prevent anticompetitiveuse of the information. The fact that the joint venture's activities areto be carried out through a separately incorporated entity is one suchsafeguard which might be supplemented by independent staffing of that entityand other steps to ensure that competitively sensitive information doesnot flow back to the venture members. Even if such safeguards were notused, however, the joint venture in this case would raise no significantspill-over concerns if entry into the relevant X-metal market were easy(it appears from the facts of this case that the X-metal market is highlyconcentrated) or other factors would make collusion in that market unlikely.The Department would also weigh the risk of anticompetitive spill-overeffects against the procompetitive benefits of the joint venture.<T3>Licensing Arrangement.</T3> If the joint venture itself is lawful,then the Department would next consider the competitive effects of thejoint venture licensing arrangements. Under the joint venture agreement,the three U.S. members of the joint venture will be granted exclusive licensesto all patent rights and know-how developed by the joint venture. In addition,Beta has agreed not to sell X-metal produced using licensed technologyin the United States. \1\\8\\2\<NOTE/> The joint venture company is the licensor and the individualjoint venture members are the licensees. These license restrictions areproperly analyzed as vertical restrictions because, by the terms of thejoint venture agreement, the joint venture participants are prohibitedfrom competing with the joint venture in developing related technology.\1\\8\\3\<NOTE/> The licensing restrictions should therefore be analyzed asdescribed in Parts I.B.4. and I.B.5. and Case 12 of these Guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\2\ This restriction is consistent with the policy underlyingsection 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337, as amended by 19U.S.C. 1337a, which allow a U.S. process patent holder to obtain reliefagainst the importation of products produced using a process covered bya valid U.S. process patent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\3\ To the extent that any horizontal restraint on technolgydevelopment was an issue, it would be resolved in step 1 of the analysis.The licensing of techonlogy owned and developed by multiple parties shouldbe treated no more harshly than technology owned and developed by a singleentity. The license restrictions in this case would be found to be anticompetitiveonly if they would facilitate collusion among owners of competing technologiesor exclude competing technologies from the market by ``tying up'' all ornearly all of the licensees capable of exploiting competing new technology.The granting of exclusive licenses generally does not raise a competitiveissue because a technology owner has no obligation to create competitionin its own technology. Here, in fact, there will be competition among thethree American companies and other companies outside the joint ventureusing current technology or shale-extraction technology developed by others.Any competing shale-extraction technology can be licensed to X-metal producersoutside the joint venture or even to the joint venture members themselves,since they are not prevented by the terms of the joint venture agreementfrom licensing competing technologies.As is true with respect to all analysis under the rule of reason, the Departmentwould not challenge the license restrictions in this case if they werenot anticompetitive, without regard to the presence or absence of procompetitivebenefits. If the restrictions posed a significant anticompetitive threat,the Department would then consider any offsetting procompetitive benefits.The Department would consider, for example, the benefits of exclusive licensesin providing incentives to licensees to develop and market products usingthe technology without fear from free-riders.Case 7_Distributing a Foreign Competitor's ProductAlpha Corporation and Beta Corporation are significant, but not dominant,manufacturers of machine tools in the United States and the Federal Republicof Germany, respectively. Neither company makes substantial sales in theother company's home country. Alpha has agreed to appoint Beta as its exclusivedistributor in the EEC, and Beta has agreed to appoint Alpha as its exclusivedistributor in North America. Both appointments will be for a period offive years.Some of Alpha's and Beta's products are directly interchangeable in use.Most, however, are either complementary (that is, they can be used in conjunctionwith each other) or have special features that substantially differentiatethem. Alpha and Beta recongize that neither company is likely to promoteimports of the other that are directly interchangeable with its own products.But each believes that their total exports under this arrangement willbe significantly greater than if an independent distributor were used.In addition, Alpha reasonably believes that the ability to offer a fullline of machine tools by handling Beta's products will enable Alpha tocompete more effectively against competing machine tool manufacturers inthe United States.Under the proposed distributorship arrangement, Alpha and Beta will eachpay a predetermined price (based on factory costs), and will be free toresell the imported machine tools at whatever price they choose. In addition,Alpha and Beta have agreed that they will prohibit their distributors inother countries from re-exporting machine tools produced by either Alphaor Beta into the EEC or North America.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>The appointment of an exclusive foreign distributor by a U.S. firm doesnot by itself raise concern under the U.S. antitrust laws. Such an arrangementnormally would not affect consumers in the United States. Where the partiesare actual or potential competitors, however, a reciprocal distributionarrangement such as the one presented in this case raises at least thepossibility that it might amount to an unlawful scheme to allocate marketsbetween the parties or that it otherwise might adversely affect competitionin a relevant market affecting U.S. consumers. This case therefore initiallyraises a question of characterization: should the distribution arrangementbetween Alpha and Beta be treated as per se unlawful market allocationbetween horizontal competitors, or should it be examined under a rule-of-reasonanalysis that recognizes the arrangement's potential procompetitive benefits?The reciprocal distribution arrangement in this case does not appear tobe a naked agreement to restrict output and/or raise price. Rather, thearrangement appears to involve an economic integration of the parties'operations (beyond simply the coordination of price and output)that mayresult in increased output.\184\<NOTE/> Although Alpha and Beta both produce machine tools, someof which are directly interchangeable, their product lines appear to largelycomplementary. Moreover, Alpha reasonably believes that its ability tooffer a full line of machine tools under the distribution arrangement willenable it to compete more effectively against other machine tool manufacturersin the United States. The fact that this arrangement is open and notoriousmakes it less likely (though not impossible) that the arrangement is designedto facilitate naked price-fixing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\184\ <T3>See </T3>nn.45 and 46 and accompanying text, <T3>supra.</T3>The Department would therefore analyze the distribution arrangement underthe rule of reason. Applying the principles and standards set forth inthe Department's Merger Guidelines, the Department would first determinewhether eliminating competition between Alpha and Beta would have an anticompetitiveeffect in a relevant market for the sale of machine tools to U.S. consumers.\185\<NOTE/> If the complete elimination of competition between Alphaand Beta through merger would not be anticompetitive (for example, becauseexisting competitors or new entrants would frustrate any attempt to exercisemarket power or because of procompetitive benefits that would outweighany anticompetitive effects), then the distribution arrangement or restrictionprohibiting Beta and its distributors from re-exporting Alpha's or Beta'smachine tools also would not be anticompetitive.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\185\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.2., <T3>supra.</T3>If a merger of Alpha and Beta would be anticompetitive, then the Departmentwould look more closely at the nature of the restrictions imposed by thisdistribution arrangement.\186\<NOTE/> The distribution arrangement may be its terms pose less ofa risk of creating or facilitating the exercise of market power than wouldan outright merger between Alpha and Beta. For example, if there were norestriction against transshipping by Beta's worldwide distributors, anyattempt by Alpha to exercise market power in the United States might beundercut by competition form Beta's distributors. Even with the transshippingrestriction, the distribution agreement may not allow perfect coordinationof the price and output of the two companies' machine tools in the UnitedStates. If that were true, then other factors (such as ease of entry orthe procompetitive benefits of the arrangement) may establish that, onbalance, the distribution arrangement would not be anticompetitive, eventhough a merger would be anticompetitive.\187\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\186\ Of course, a restriction that had no plausible connectionto the efficient operation of the distribution arrangement, but was simplya naked attempt to restrict output and/or fix price, would be analyzedindependently and might be subject to prosecution even though the reciprocaldistribution arrangement itself and other restraints related to it werelawful. Thus, for example, the Department would not hesitate to prosecutea side agreement by the parties in this case covertly to fix the priceof an unrelated product not covered by the distribution arrangement thatthey purported to sell in competition with one another.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\187\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.3., <T3>supra, </T3>and Case 5.Case 8_Exclusive Vertical Distribution ArrangementsAs in Case 7, Alpha Corporation and Beta Corporation are significant, butnot dominant, manufacturers of machine tools in the United States and theFederal Republic of Germany, respectively. The relevant market for thesale of machine tools is not highly concentrated. Although some of themachine tools produced by Alpha and Beta are directly interchangeable inuse, most are complementary or substantially different. Beta makes substantialsales in the United States. It has appointed Delta Distribution Inc. asits exclusive distributor of machine tools in the United States. Beta choseDelta because of Delta's substantial experience and expertise in the promotionand sale of machine tools. Beta's other worldwide distributors are prohibitedfrom selling Beta's machine tools in the United States or to firms thatintend to transship Beta's machine tools to the United States.For a number of years, Alpha has been selling machine tools in the UnitedStates through a large number of non-exclusive independent distributors,selling to whichever distributors sent in orders. During the period thatit has employed this distribution method, Alpha's market share has graduallydeclined. To halt this decline, Alpha has recently selected Delta as itsexclusive U.S. distributor. Alpha believes that Delta will more effectivelydistribute Alpha's brand of machine tools because of Delta's expertiseand because, under Alpha's new distribution system, the exclusive rightto distribute Alpha's products will result in better promotion and servicingof Alpha's tools. Alpha initially was concerned that Delta might be lessaggressive in promoting Alpha's line of machine tools because Delta alsodistributed Beta's line. However, Alpha ultimately concluded that, sinceBeta's line largely complemented Alpha's line, both product lines wouldbenefit if Delta could market both. Alpha prohibited Delta from distributingthe machine tools of any other supplier of machine tools except for thoseof Beta, however. In selecting Delta, Alpha chose among several competingdistributors.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>This case illustrates the use of two types of vertical nonprice restraints:the grant of an exclusive territory to a distributor and the requirementthat a distributor deal exclusively with the products of a limited numberof manufacturers. The appointment of an exclusive U.S. distributor (ora group of exclusive distributors, each with an exclusive territory thatrepresents only part of the United States) by a manufacturer generallyraises no significant antitrust concern. Indeed, such arrangements cansubstantially enhance interbrand competition. For example, granting distributorsexclusive territories may encourage distributors to provide substantialpromotion and post-sale services that are necessary to gain recognitionfor, or build up good will in, the manufacturer's brand by preventing otherdistributiors that do not provide these services from ``free-riding.''\188\<NOTE/> Under the rule of Reason, of course, the Department wouldchallenge a vertical restraint only if it would have a significant anticompetitiveeffect in some relevant market, regardless of whether the parties havea procompetitive explanation for the restraint.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\188\ See I.B. 4., <T3>supra</T3>.<T3>Exclusive Territories/Transhipping Prohibition. </T3>Under certainmarket conditions, widespread use of exclusive territories by leading manufacturersconceivably might facilitate collusion among distributors of competingmanufacturers. Such collusion would be possible in this case, however,only if: (i) The relevant market for the sale of machine tools were veryhighly concentrated; (ii) distributors subject to exclusive territoriesaccounted for a large portion of the market; and (iii) entry into distributionwere difficult. Even then, a careful analysis of all relevant factors mightindicate that Beta's use of exclusive territories would not facilitatecollusion with respect to the output or price of competing brands of machinetools or, if it would, that the procompetitive benefits of Beta's distributionarrangement outweighed the risk of anticompetitive effects.In this case, it is clear that the appointment of Delta as exclusive U.S.distributor by both Alpha and Beta would pose no significant risk of collusion.Because there are many machine tool manufacturers in the relevant market,coordinating and policing the pricing and output activities of those manufacturerswould be very difficult, if not impossible, without an explicit agreementamong them. Rival manufacturers would have an incentive to cheat by sellingdirectly to consumers or by dealing with non-colluding distributors. Therefore,even if each machine tool manufacturer in the relevant market were verticallyintegrated into distribution or distributed through exclusive distributors,it would be extremely unlikely that the manufacturers could successfullydevelop, police, and benefit from a scheme to facilitate collusion at thedealer level.<T3>Exclusive Dealing Requirement. </T3>Alpha's restriction on Delta'sability to deal with machine tool manufacturers other than Alpha and Betaalso would not be anticompetitive. In fact, exclusive (or partially exclusive)distributorships generally pose no antitrust concern. Instead, they generallyenhance efficiency and increase interbrand competition. For example, anexclusive dealing requirement may enable the manufacturer to protect itsinvestment in services, such as advertising and training, provided to dealers,that the dealer might otherwise use to sell the goods of competing manufacturers.Exclusivity can also ensure that the dealer devotes optimal effort andattention to promoting the manufacturer's brand rather than that of a rival.In this case, because Beta's line of machine tools largely complementsAlpha's line, the exclusivity arrangement might encourage Delta to promoteboth lines without divided loyalty to either.Under certain market conditions, a restraint that required a distributorto deal exclusively in the product of one or a limited number of manufacturersconceivably might have the effect of excluding rival manufacturers fromthe market by denying them access to essential distribution facilities.Such an effect would be plausible, however, only if: (i) The manufacturingmarket were highly concentrated and leading manfacturing employed the sameor very similar restraints; (ii) distributors subject to the restraintcontrolled a large share of the market; and (iii) entry into the distributionmarket were difficult. As with the threat of collusion, these three conditionsare the minimum necessary (but not sufficient) conditions required to createa plausible risk of anticompetitive exclusion. Other factors, includingthe procompetitive benefits of the exclusive dealing arrangement, mightindicate that the restraint is competitively neutral or even procompetitive.\189\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\189\ <T3>See</T3> I.B. 4., <T3>supra</T3>.In this case, it appears that there are a number of distributors otherthan Delta with which competing machine tool manufacturers could deal.Moreover, the relevant machine tool market is not highly concentrated.Therefore, even if all existing distributors were subject to exclusivedealing arrangements (so that machine tool manufacturers seeking to enterthe market would have to integrate into distribution or establish a newdistributor), there could be no anticompetitive effect in the relevantmachine tool market.Case 9_A Multinational OperationAlpha Corporation is a large, well-known multinational corporation headquarteredin New York City. Alpha manufactures printing machines in New Jersey. Itexports its printing machines only to Latin American countries. It usesoverseas subsidiaries to manufacture and sell its products throughout therest of the world. Although Alpha's patents on its printing machines expiredyears ago, Alpha and its subsidiaries collectively have retained a dominantposition in most markets because of superior sales and service organizations,accumulated know-how, and low manufacturing costs.The Alpha system of management involves a strong ``profit center'' concept.Individual subsidiaries are judged by their ability to develop sales intheir assigned territories. Normally, when an order comes in to one Alphasubsidiary from the assigned territory of another, the recipient sendsit on, or suggests that the consumer contact directly the subidiary assignedto the territory.The Alpha group of companies comprises three subsidiaries. Alpha (U.K.)Limited manufactures Alpha products and sells them throughout the UnitedKingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth, except Canada.Alpha (U.K.) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alpha when it was formedin 1954, but 40 percent of its stock is now publicly held as a result ofa 1964 public stock offering. Beta Corporation is a wholly-owned Canadiansubsidiary of Alpha that manufactures and sells Alpha products only inCanada. Alpha G.m.b.H., incorporated in the Federal Republic of Germany,manufactures and sells Alpha products in the Common Market countries otherthan the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and all other countriesexcept the Commonwealth, Canada, the United States, and Latin America.Alpha acquired Alpha G.m.b.H. in 1951 from four large individual investors.Alpha now holes 56 percent of the stock of Alpha G.m.b.H. The remaining44 percent is evenly divided among the four original investors.Alpha plans to sell an additional seven percent of its stock holdings inAlpha G.m.b.H., which would leave Alpha with 49 percent of the stock ofAlpha G.m.b.H., but effective working control. Alpha is also negotiatingto sell 50 percent of the stock of Beta Corporation to a Canadian corporationwhich purchases the stock of Canadian companies for investment purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>This case involves the issue of intra-enterprise conspiracy. In <T3>Copperweld Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Independence Tube Corp.,</T3>\1\\9\\0\<NOTE/> the Supreme Court held that, because a parent corporationand its wholly-owned subsidiary have a ``complete unity'' of economic interests,they are not independent actors capable of conspiring to restrain tradewithin the meaning of section 1 of the Sherman Act.\1\\9\\1\<NOTE/> The Court declined to decide whether the same result wouldapply where a subsidiary is less than wholly-owned.\1\\9\\2\<NOTE/> In the Department's view, however, the policies underlyingthe Sherman Act (as discussed in <T3>Copperweld</T3>)\1\\9\\3\<NOTE/> support the conclusion that a parent corporation and anysubsidiary corporation of which the parent owns more than 50 percent ofthe voting stock are a single economic unit under common control and arethus legally incapable of conspiring with one another within the meaningof section 1.\1\\9\\4\<NOTE/> If a parent company controlled a significant but less thanmajority share of the voting stock of a subsidiary, the Department wouldmake a factual inquiry to determine whether the parent corporation actuallyhad effective working control of the subsidiary.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\0\ 467 U.S. 752 (1984).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\1\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 771, 777.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\2\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 767.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\3\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 767-777.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\4\ This standard is consistent with the Department'slongstanding practice under section 7 of the Clayton Act of treating asa merger any stock acquisition that would facilitate coordination of theprice and output decisions of the acquiring and acquired firms. The acquisitionof more than 50 percent of the stock of another firm, for example, is alwaystreated as a merger despite the continued existence of a significant minorityinterest. In such cases, the Department presumes that the acquired andacquiring firms will coordinate their behavior. Of course, the Departmentmay also challenge under section 7 stock acquisitions that involve lessthan 50 percent of the stock of the acquired company.In this case, the Department would likely view Alpha and its subsidiariesas a single economic entity incapable of conspiring among themselves becauseAlpha holds a majority voting stock interest (100 percent, 60 percent,and 56 percent, respectively) in each of them. Alpha's sale of its majorityinterests in the German and Canadian subsidiaries would probably not changethat conclusion. Alpha would retain nearly a majority stock interest andapparent effective working control since it appears that the remainingstock interests in both subsidiaries would be held by passive investorsthat do not represent any independent competitive interests. As a practicalmatter, Alpha and the subsidiaries should continue to function as a singleeconomic entity, and there would be no change in the essential competitivesituation. If it appeared, however, that Alpha relinquished effective workingcontrol over either subsidiary, then Alpha and that subsidiary would notbe viewed as a single economic entity, and any agreement between them wouldbe subject to normal antitrust rules under section 1 of the Sherman Act.Case 10_Vertical Restraints in a Patent LicenseAutoGlass Corporation is a leading U.S. producer of windshields and otherautomobile glass. It markets these products to automakers and in the automotiveaftermarket throughout the world. AutoGlass has no other business. AutoGlassinvents a new, scratch-resistant transparent coating for automobile glassapplications and obtains U.S. and foreign product patent protection forthis material, which it calls AGPLEX. AutoGlass discovers broad interestin AGPLEX from safety eyeglass manufacturers, who believe that such a materialwould revolutionize the safety eyeglass market because of the superiorityof AGPLEX-coated safety eyeglasses as compared to the uncoated safety eyeglassesthat currently dominate the market, which are prone to scratching and breaking.Amer-Eye Company, one of many safety eyeglass manufacturers in the UnitedStates, obtains an exclusive, field-of-use license under AutoGlass' U.S.patent to make and sell safety eyeglasses coated with AGPLEX in the UnitedStates. Amer-Eye's AGPLEX license forbids Amer-Eye from manufacturing andselling safety eyeglasses coated with any other material. Amer-Eye is notprohibited from continuing to manufacture and sell uncoated safety eyeglasses.The license requires Amer-Eye to pay royalties based on its total unitsales of safety eyeglasses, regardless of whether they are coated withAGPLEX.British Optics Corporation, one of several British safety eyeglass manufacturers,is granted an exclusive license by AutoGlass to make and sell safety eyeglassescoated with AGPLEX in the United Kingdom and in all other member countriesof the EEC. British Optics' license is subject to the same manufacturingrestriction and royalties payment provision that are contained in Amer-Eye'slicense. British Optics has been selling safety eyeglasses in the UnitedStates (accounting for five percent of U.S. consumption) and would haveliked a license under AutoGlass's U.S. patent, as well. Otherwise, BritishOptics cannot sell safety eyeglasses coated with AGPLEX in the United States. AutoGlass's licenses of its other patents throughout the world have noarguable effect on U.S. commerce.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion  </ITAG>As is the case with international agreements generally, the Department'sconsideration of the patent licenses in this case would be limited to theeffects of the licenses on U.S. commerce. Otherwise, the Department's substantiveanalysis of the licenses in this case would be identical to its analysisof similar agreements in a purely domestic context.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Rule of Reason Analysis  </ITAG>Unless the underlying transfer of technology is a sham, or the licenserestrictions restrain competition between the licensor and licensee andbear no relationship to the underlying transfer of technology, the restrictionsin an intellectual property license are analyzed under the rule of reason.There is no indication that the licenses to Amer-Eye and British Opticsin this case are a sham or that any of the restrictions would restraincompetition between either of them and AutoGlass. The licenses appear tobe of great value to the licensees. Therefore, the Department would analyzethe licenses in this case under a rule of reason.  This case demonstrates application of the rule of reason to purely verticalrestraints in a patent license. AutoGlass does not compete in the safetyeyeglass market, and there is no indication that either Amer-Eye or BritishOptics compete with AutoGlass in any relevant technology market. The licensetherefore does not restrain horizontal competition between AutoGlass andits licensees.  The license restrictions in this case would be anticompetitive only ifthey would (i) facilitate collusion in the sale of all safety eyeglasses\1\\9\\5\<NOTE/> or in the licensing of technologies that compete with AGPLEXor (ii) exclude competing technologies from the market by ``tying up''so much of the potential eyeglass manufacturing capacity that no competingtechnology could effectively enter the market. In determining whether anyor all of the vertical restraints in Amer-Eye's license in this case wouldbe anticompetitive, the Department would apply the rule of reason analysisset forth in Part I.B.4.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\5\ If AGPLEX proved to be so superior to uncoated safetyeyeglasses that it truly monopolized the relevant market, then the coordinationof competition among producers of AGPLEX-coated eyeglasses would not violatethe antitrust laws. Those laws do not require an intellectual propertyowner to create competition in its own technology. The collusion concernwould exist only if the licenses and their restrictions would facilitatecollusion among competitors in a larger market (if one exists) that includesuncoated safety eyeglasses and eyeglasses coated with some substance otherthan AGPLEX.  On the facts of this case, the Department could quickly conclude that neithercollusion nor anticompetitive exclusion is likely. First, it does not appearthat the restrictions in this case would facilitate collusion with respectto the output and/or pricing of either safety eyeglasses or coating technologies.None of the license restrictions would tend to facilitate collusion amongthe many competing safety eyeglass manufacturers in the United States_thegrant of an exclusive license to one of those manufacturers would not enableAutoGlass to help police a cartel among safety eyeglass manufacturers ormake it any easier for all safety eyeglass manufacturers to reach agreement.Nor, on the facts of this case, does it appear that the license is intendedto or would have the effect of facilitating collusion among AutoGlass andowners of competing technologies, since no other competing technologiesappear to exist. Moreover, even if competing coating technologies are developed,AutoGlass's prior decision to grant only one U.S. license would not appearto make collusion between AutoGlass and any other competing technologyowner any more likely than if AutoGlass tried to exploit the safety eyeglassfield on its own.  Second, it does not appear from the facts of this case that the licenserestriction would exclude rival technologies from the market. There aremany other safety eyeglass manufacturers in the market that could developand use competing technologies. There also is no indication that entryinto the manufacture and sale of safety eyeglasses would be difficult. The Department would not be concerned about the ability of manufacturersof non-coated safety eyeglasses to compete with Amer-Eye. The antitrustlaws do not condemn even monopolies that are obtained through the offeringof superior products. Nor do they require patentholders to make their technologyopen to all. Others are free to attempt to develop technologies that wouldcompete with AGPLEX and, in the meantime, AutoGlass and its licensees areentitled under our patent laws to enjoy whatever competitive advantagesmay result form AutoGlass's innovation.  Because it is clear that the license arrangements in this case are notanticompetitive, it is irrelevant whether the restrictions in those licensesare efficient. The Department would determine not to challenge the restrictionswithout further analysis. Even in the rare case where vertical restrictionsin a technology license raise a significant anticompetitive risk, however,the Department would consider their procompetitive benefits before condemningthem. The following are some of the beneficial competitive effects of therestrictions presented in this case.  <T3>Exclusive Licenses.</T3> The principal value of a patent is the rightto its exclusive use, and a licensor may properly seek to transfer thisright to another in the form of an exclusive license to practice the patentgenerally, or for a specific purpose. Licensing the patent in this waymay maximize the return on the patentee's investment in innovation. Exclusivityalso may facilitate more efficient development and promotion of the patentby the licensee without fear of free-riding from other licensees (or eventhe patentee). For example, it may encourage the licensee to develop mini-innovationswhich, although they may not be patentable, would nevertheless make thetechnology more valuable to consumers.\1\\9\\6\<NOTE/> While this case involves an exclusive field-of-use license,other forms of exclusive licenses_for example, granting the licensee exclusiverights to sell the patented product in some area of the United States orto some class of customers_provide similar benefits, and the Departmentanalyzes such restrictions under the rule of reason as well.\1\\9\\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\6\ <T3>See</T3> ``The Antitrust Implications of International Licensing: Afterthe Nine No-no's,'' Remarks by Charles F. Rule before the Legal Conferencesponsored by the World Trade Association and the Cincinnati Patent LawAssociation (Oct. 21, 1986).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\7\ The exclusivity of British Optics' license to makeand market safety eyeglasses coated with AGPLEX in the EEC would not appearto affect U.S. consumers. The fact that would-be American exporters ofAGPLEX-coated safety eyeglasses will not possess European AGPLEX licenses,and thus may not be able to sell such eyeglasses in the EEC, would nothave the requisite direct effect on U.S. commerce to trigger antitrustconcern.<T3>Restriction on Use of Competing Technologies. </T3>AutoGlass's requirementthat Amer-Eye use only AGPLEX to coat its safety eyeglasses can also beprocompetitive.\198\<NOTE/> This restriction gives Amer-Eye a strong incentive to developand aggressively market the licensed technology. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\8\ The similar restriction in British Optics' licensewould not appear to affect U.S. commerce. <T3>See </T3>n. 197. <T3>Royalties Based on Total Sales. </T3>The Department generally is notconcerned with the amount of license royalties or the way in which licenseroyalties are paid. Licensees will pay for the licensed technology whatthey think the technology is worth. Moreover, various types of royaltypayment provisions such as, for example, package licensing and royaltieson sales of products made from a patented process, encourage licenseesto develop and promote the licensed technology efficiently by enablingthe licensee to use the technology in combination with other inputs inorder to produce the final product at the lowest possible cost. Such restrictionsalso may save licensors the costs of monitoring licensees' production todetermine how much of that production utilizes the licensed technology.The total-sales royalty provision in this case also effectively supportsthe prohibition on the licensees' use of other coating materials.Case 11_Exclusive Patent Cross-Licenses With Grantbacks  Alpha Corporation, a U.S. Firm, is the second largest seller of productX in the United States. Beta Corporation, a Japanese firm, is the largestseller of X in Japan. Alpha and Beta each possess both U.S. and Japaneseprocess patents covering certain technologies they use in manufacturingproduct X. Alpha and Beta do not currently market significant amounts ofX in each other's home country.  Alpha and Beta agree to cross-license one another to practice their relevantforeign patents. Alpha grants to Beta the exclusive right (exclusive evenof Alpha) to practice Alpha's Japanese patents, and Beta grants to Alphathe exclusive right (exclusive even of Beta) to practice Beta's U.S. patents.Each license has an exclusive grantback clause: If Beta makes any patentedimprovements on Alpha's technology, Beta will assign the U.S. rights tosuch improvements to Alpha; if Alpha makes any patented improvements onBeta's technology, Alpha will assign the Japanese rights to such improvementsto Beta. Alpha and Beta also agree that if either of them makes any improvementson its own technology, an exclusive license will be granted to the otherparty to practice such improvements in the other party's home country.Finally, Alpha and Beta agreee that X they produce with licensed technologywill not be marketed in the home country of the other party. In sum, theoverall effect of the license arrangements between Alpha and Beta is thatAlpha will have the exclusive right to practice both its own and Beta'stechnology, and all improvements thereon, in the United States and Betawill have comparable rights in Japan.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion  </ITAG>As is the case with international agreements generally, the Department'sconsideration of the process patent licenses in this case would be limitedto their effects on U.S. commerce. Otherwise, the Department's substantiveanalysis of these arrangements would be identical to its analysis of similartechnology licensing arrangements arising in a purely domestic context.<ITAG tagnum="81">Rule of Reason Analysis  </ITAG>Unless the underlying transfer of technology is a sham, or the licenserestrictions restrain competition between the licensor and licensee andbear no relationship to the underlying transfer of technology, the restrictionsin an intellectual property license are analyzed under the rule of reason.\1\\9\\9\<NOTE/> Here, there is nothing to suggest that the technology beingtransferred is valueless or insignificant to each licensee in the manufactureof product X.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\9\ For example, exclusive cross-licensing arrangementswith exclusive grantback features, such as the arrangements in this case,can conceivably be used anticompetitively by firms that currently competeor that foresee such competition, and wish to eliminate or forestall itby entering into sham licensing arrangements that divide territories orcustomers, or otherwise allocate markets.  The license arrangements in this case contain several types of restrictionsthat are frequently found in international patent licensing arrangements.First, each party, as licensee, has agreed to grant back to the licensorrights in any improvements that the licensee develops in the licensor'stechnology. Second, each party, as licensor, has agreed to grant the licenseerights to practice any improvements that the licensor develops in its owntechnology. Third, all of the existing and future rights being grantedare exclusive_even as to the granting party. Finally, the licenses havethe effect of restricting competition between the parties in the marketingof products they produce using the licensed technologies.In this case, the cumulative competitive effect of the license restrictionsis indistinguishable from an acquisition by Alpha of Beta's technologyinsofar as its use to compete in the United States is concerned. Althoughthe Department would consider the cumulative competitive effects of thelicense and its restrictions, it would be helpful to discuss each of therestrictions individually, since they need not be used together in a license.Because Alpha and Beta own competing technologies for producing X,\200\<NOTE/> restrictions contained in the cross-licenses on Alpha's andBeta's use of those technologies are properly analyzed as horizontal restraints.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\200\ For the purpose of this case, it is assumed that thetechnologies owned by Alpha and Beta are substitutes. As a practical matter,however, it often is difficult to determine whether particular technologiesare substitutes, complements, or both. For example, while X produced usingeither Alpha's or Beta's technology may be viewed as functionally interchangeableby consumers, it may be possible to produce X more efficiently using thetechnologies of Alpha and Beta together, rather than by using either technologyalone. In other cases, patents may be pure complements, or may be blocking(such that one cannot be used without the other), and thus may not be substitutesat all.<T3>Cross-Licensing. </T3>In general, the cross-licensing of competingor potentially competing technologies is procompetitive because it expandsaccess to technology. In this case, for example, the cross-license allowsAlpha and Beta each to use an alternative technology to which it otherwisewould not have access, but which may be more efficient than its own technology.The license arrangement in effect allows Alpha and Beta to choose betweenthe technologies based on their relative efficiencies in producing X. Similarly,if their technologies are at least partially complementary (that is, ifin some circumstances, they would be more efficient when used together),the cross-license may enable Alpha and Beta to compete more effectivelyagainst the owners of other technologies. The cross-license may also allowAlpha and Beta to avoid protracted and expensive, good-faith litigationover the validity and infringement of their respective patents.<T3>Grantbacks. </T3>A grantback feature in a patent license also is oftenprocompetitive.\201\<NOTE/> Where practicing a patent is likely to lead to further innovationsin the patented technology (whether or not such innovations are patentable),a grantback may enable a patentee to avoid the possibility that such innovationby the licensee will either make obsolete the patentee's own technologyor effectively prevent the patentee from itself developing further improvementsin its technology.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\201\ <T3>See </T3>Transparent-Wrap Machine Corp. <T3>v. </T3>Stokes andamp; Smith Co., 329 U.S. 637 (1947) (holding that agrantback is not per se unlawful); <T3>see also </T3>ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 6, U.S. AntitrustLaw in International Patent and Know-how Licensing 53-62 (1981).A grantback also may serve to compensate the patentee for improvementsdeveloped by the licensee that the licensee could not have developed withoutaccess to the patentee's technology. In this case, for example, where Beta'sability to develop improvements on Alpha's technology may require actualpractice of Alpha's patents, Alpha is entitled to be compensated for conferringthis benefit on Beta, and a grantback of any U.S. rights to such improvementsis a logical choice for such compensation. Such a grantback could alsoincrease the efficiency of bargaining for a license,\202\<NOTE/> which directly benefits the parties and ultimately inuresto the benefit of consumers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\202\ Essentially, the grantback functions as considerationto the patentee in a contract to develop the licensed technology, in whichthe price has been determined ex ante (in the form of a grantback), ratherthan ex post (that is, after the improvements have been achieved), whenbargaining might be difficult because of the bilateral monopoly positionof the parties.<T3>Conveyance of Rights to Future Improvements by Licensor. </T3>The fundamentalpurpose of a patent license, like other technology transfers, is to allowthe licensee to use the technology efficiently to his and the licensor'smutual benefit, as well as to the benefit of consumers. Such use oftenwill require significant investment by the licensee. Licensees may be reluctantto make such investments, however, if there is a significant risk thatthe patentee will improve the underlying technology and make the originally-licensedtechnology obsolete. Thus, just as a grantback may protect a licensor fromadverse effects deriving from improvements on the licensed technology bythe licensee, an agreement allowing the licensee to use any improvementsin the technology developed by the licensor can protect the licensee'sinvestment in the technology.<T3>Exclusivity. </T3>Exclusivity associated with patent cross-licensesand grantbacks is also generally procompetitive. Exclusivity is in factinherent in the patent grant itself; the patent laws do not require patenteesto create additional competitors. Exclusivity may also encourage licenseesto maximize their promotion and utilization of the licensed technologywithout free-rider concerns, and allow a patent owner to maximize the returnon his investment in Randamp;D efforts to acquire the patent.Restriction on Competition between Licensor and Licensee. Currently, U.S.patent law does not forbid the importation and sale of products made overseaswith a process patented in the United States.\203\<NOTE/> Although a U.S. process patentee may have other rights toprevent such importation and sale,\204\<NOTE/> restrictions in process patent licenses that guard againstsuch importation and sale can be procompetitive by enabling the U.S. processpatent owner to exploit his technology more effectively overseas withoutfearing that such licensing will disrupt his exploitation of the technologyin the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\203\  The Congress, however, frequently has considered amendmentsto the patent laws that would close this loophole: <T3>see, e.g., </T3>S. 539, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\204\  <T3>See </T3>section 337a of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337a.As noted above, the cumulative effect of the licensing arrangement, insofaras U.S. commerce is concerned, is the effective acquisition by Alpha ofBeta's technology, including any of Beta's improvements on that technology,with respect to its application in the United States. If an outright acquisitionof Beta's technology would not violate the antitrust laws, then neitherwould these licenses violate the law. The Department would therefore beginits analysis in this case by defining, and examining the structure of,the relevant market in which the technologies of Alpha and Beta compete.That market would include (i) all other technologies that appear to befunctional substitutes for the licensed technologies in producing X and(ii) technologies used to produce products that are reasonable substitutesfor X to which consumers would switch if the price of X were significantlyincreased. After identifying the technologies the market (which typicallywill be international in scope),\205\<NOTE/> market shares would be assigned that reflect the relativeefficiency of those technologies. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\205\  Patents, of course, grant exclusive rights to the useof the underlying technology only to the geographic extent of the grantingauthority's jurisdictional reach. For example, a patent granted by theU.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides only the exclusive right to make,use, or sell the patented invention in the United States. Technologiestypically are granted intellectual property protection in various nationalmarkets. And as a general matter, a technology developed and patented inJapan can readily be patented and transferred to compete in the UnitedStates. The Department's analysis of technology markets is generally a qualitativeone, focusing on the relative efficiency of the available technologiesand the time that it would like take for comparably efficient alternativetechnologies to be brought to the market. Where technologies have beenin competition for some time (for example, in this case, the technologiesused to produce the current generation of X and close substitutes for X),differences in market share may be a reasonable proxy for differences inthe relative efficiency of technologies. In cases involving emerging technologies,where there are no available proxies for the relative efficiency of technologies,the Department must qualitatively assess the likely future strength ofsuch technologies in the market as well as whether alternative technologieswould likely be brought to the market sufficiently promptly so as to undercutany attempted exercise of market power. In the case, the Department would consider a number of factors. First,among other factors, the Department would consider whether X accounts forsuch a small share of the relevant produce market that any attempt to exercisemarket power with respect to technologies used to produce X would be frustratedby consumers switching to close substitutes for X.\206\<NOTE/> Second, the Department would consider whether other firmsalso possess patents or valuable know-how that could be used to produceX or to produce products that would be close substitutes for X. Third,the Department would consider whether the patents of either Alpha or Betahave expired or are soon to expire, such that other firms could use thetechnologies (or improvements or variations thereon) to produce a productthat would compete with X or close substitutes for X.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\206\ As discussed in part I.B.5. of these Guidelines, individualpatents and patented products may compete in a market with many other economicsubstitutes.If X sales account for only a small share of the relevant product marketthat includes X, for example, the licensing arrangement in this case maybe important to enable Alpha (in the United States) and Beta (in Japan)to compete more effectively against other products in the market, but itmay confer no market power on either or both of them. On the other hand,if there were no close substitutes for X and the licensed technologieswould be clearly superior to all available alternative technologies formaking X, then an effective acquisition by Alpha of Beta's technology asapplied in the U.S. market for X might be anticompetitive. Because in thiscase it appears that there are producers of X other than Alpha and Beta,it is not clear the extent to which this license would increase concentrationin the relevant market. Moreover, the Department would consider the otherrelevant market factors that would be considered when evaluating a mergeror acquisition.\207\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ <T3>See </T3>I.B.2., <T3>supra.</T3>If the Department concluded after examining all of the relevant circumstancesthat the licensing arrangement in this case would have a significant anticompetitiveeffect, then the Department would consider whether competitive benefitsthat would result from the arrangement would outweigh the likelihood ofanticompetitive harm. As noted above, by eliminating the possibility ofcompetition from one another, Alpha and Beta each may be better able efficientlyto develop and market their combined technologies. It may be difficultto develop consumer acceptance for their technologies unless substantialinvestment is made in education and training. In that case, particularlyif there were other available technologies in the market, the net effectof the restrictions might be procompetitive. If the licensing arrangementwould have significant anticompetitive effects, the burden would be onthe parties to show that the benefits resulting from it would outweighthose effects.Case 12_Know-How Technology Transfer Agreement With Exclusive TerritoriesAlpha Corporation is a small, but growing, Massachusetts corporation thatpossesses valuable unpatented know-how that is used to produce productX. Alpha has not been successful in exporting X to other countries. Alphaproposes to enter into a twenty-year technology transfer agreement witha German firm, Beta Corporation, under which Alpha will convey its know-howto Beta. Beta is a large, well-financed multinational corporation thatdoes not currently produce X, but produces closely related products andwishes to produce and sell X in the EEC. As part of the technology transferagreement, Beta will agree not to sell X in the United States, whetherit is manufactured with Alpha's know-how or any other technology, for theduration of the agreement.Alpha is negotiating a similar agreement with Epsilon Corporation, a largeJapanese firm which currently produces X. Epsilon's technology has permittedit to obtain only a small share of the Japanese market, and to make evenmore limited sales in the United States. Epsilon believes that Alpha'stechnology will increase Epsilon's production efficiency and improve thequality of the X it produces. Epsilon insists that Beta be barred fromselling X in Japan, Australia, and East Asia. The prohibition would applyto all X produced by Beta, whether or not it was produced using Alpha'sknow-how.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>As is the case with respect to international agreements generally, theDepartment's consideration of the know-how transfer agreements in thiscase would be limited to their effects on U.S. commerce. Otherwise, theDepartment's substantive analysis of the agreements would be identicalto its analysis of similar technology licensing arrangements arising ina purely domestic context.<ITAG tagnum="81">Know-How</ITAG>Know-how is useful technical information concerning productive activitythat is not generally known or accessible but is not protected by a patent.\2\\0\\8\<NOTE/> Like patented technology, know-how represents the fruitsof inventive activity that is stimulated by the legal protection of property.\2\\0\\9\<NOTE/> Because of the essentially similar roles that know-how transfersand patent licensing play in the competitive process, the Department generallyanalyzes them in the same way. In fact, precisely because know-how is notstatutorily defined and protected by a government grant, restrictions inagreements transferring know-how may be even more essential to protectingprocompetitive investment in valuable technology. Because know-how is notnecessarily susceptible to precise definition, however, in some cases itmay be more difficult to distinguish a legitimate know-how transfer froma sham arrangement shielding a naked cartel. In appropriate cases, therefore,the Department may be required to determine whether the know-how that istransferred is of significant economic value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\8\ <T3>See </T3>Kilpatrick and Mahinka, ``Antitrust and the InternationalLicensing of Trade Secrets and Know-how: A Need for Guidelines,'' 9 Lawandamp; Pol'y in Int'l Bus. 725, 728 (1977).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 485 (1974).<ITAG tagnum="81">Rule-of-Reason Analysis</ITAG>Unless the underlying transfer of technology is a sham, or the licenserestrictions restrain competition between the licensor and licensee andbear no relationship to the underlying transfer of technology, the restrictionsin a know-how license are analyzed under the rule of reason.\2\\1\\0\<NOTE/> That analysis focuses on whether a restriction in such anagreement would likely lead to the unilateral or concerted exercise ofmarket power in any market.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\0\ If the transferred know-how in this case were oftrivial importance to the efficient production of X, for example, the agreementmight be a mere sham intended to restrict output and raise the price ofX. There is no indication in this case, however, that Alpha's know-howis valueless to Beta and Epsilon and merely an excuse for Alpha, Beta,and Epsilon to form a cartel for the sale of X.The proposed agreements in this case involve restrictions commonly foundin international technology licensing arrangements. Beta and Epsilon willbe restricted from using Alpha's know-how to compete with Alpha in sellingX in the United States. Indeed, Beta and Epsilon will be restricted fromselling X manufactured by any means in the United States. Finally, Betawill be restricted from selling X, regardless of how it was manufactured,in foreign markets that Epsilon wishes to reserve for itself. Althoughthe restrictions have procompetitive potential as discussed below, theDepartment would not challenge a know-how licensing arrangement that, underthe relevant circumstances, did not raise a significant anticompetitiverisk, regardless of whether the parties could establish the competitivebenefits of the restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Restriction on Sale of X in Competition with Licensor</ITAG>In this case, Beta and Epsilon are not identically situated as existingor potential competitors of Alpha in the U.S. X market. Epsilon possessescompeting technology, and does in fact compete with Alpha in the relevantmarket. Thus, the Department would analyze the restriction on Epsilon'ssales of X in the United States_to the extent such sales are or could bemade without access to Alpha's know-how_as a horizontal restraint. Theeffect of the restriction may be approximated to that of a merger of Alphaand Epsilon. The Department would therefore identify the relevant marketfor X as set forth in the Merger Guidelines and determine whether the structuraland other characteristics of that market might subject it to the exerciseof market power if Epsilon and Alpha coordinated the price and output ofX. The Department would analyze the cumulative effect of Alpha's licenseto Epsilon in view of Alpha's license to Beta, which excludes Beta fromentering the U.S. market for X.Beta, on the other hand, does not currently compete with Alpha in the U.S.market for X and does not appear from the facts of this case to be a potentialcompetitor \2\\1\\1\<NOTE/> in that market through the development of its own technology.The Department's concern with this restriction would be with its possibleexclusion of X produced with competing technology from the U.S. market.Under the terms of the license, Beta cannot provide an entry vehicle forX produced with technologies that compete with Alpha's. If Beta were uniquelycapable of developing competing know-how and entering the U.S. market withit, then the restriction in Beta's license could be anticompetitive, assumingthat Alpha (alone or in tacit concert with a few other leading competitors)had market power. However, if Beta were not uniquely positioned to usecompeting technology, if there were several firms that could sell X inthe United States using their own competing technologies, or if the U.S.market for X were not highly concentrated, then the restriction in Beta'slicense would have no anticompetitive effect.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Case 3 and Mergers Guidelines section 4.If the foregoing analysis showed that excluding Beta and/or Epsilon fromselling X in the United States could be anticompetitive, the Departmentwould determine whether the risk of anticompetitive effects would be outweighedby the restriction's procompetitive effects. The restriction on sales ofX by Beta and Epsilon in the United States could be procompetitive by encouragingtransfer of the know-how in the first place. As is true with respect toall forms of intellectual property, the creator of know-how is not requiredto transfer it, and may not do so if he would thereby reduce the valueof the know-how. Extending the prohibition to all X, no matter how it isproduced, could save Alpha_and probably Beta, Epsilon, and consumers aswell_the costs of monitoring compliance with a narrower restriction. Itmight be difficult, for example, for Alpha to discover and prove that aparticular product was made using its know-how. Moreover, even if Alphacould prove that a product was made using know-how very similar to itsown, there might be significant dispute and litigation to resolve whetherthe transferee's know-how was developed independently. Of course, in thiscase, U.S. consumers would not be the primary beneficiaries of the transferof Alpha's know-how to Beta and Epsilon. Therefore, depending on the natureand the degree of the anticompetitive risk, the Department might determinethat the license should not restrict Beta and/or Epsilon from selling inthe United States X made using other technologies.<ITAG tagnum="81">Foreign Territorial Restrictions on Licensees</ITAG>The territorial restriction on competition between Beta and Epsilon wouldnot appear to have any direct effect on U.S. commerce and would thereforenot fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of the U.S. antitrust laws.\212\<NOTE/> Even in a domestic context, however, the grant of exclusiveterritories to licensees of a single technology generally would not beanticompetitive. Such restrictions often will promote the development anddissemination of the technology_indeed, the assignment of exclusive territoriesmay be viewed by the licensor as necessary to encourage licensees to investthe resources required to develop and exploit the licensed technology andto invest in``mini-innovations'' that would significantly increase itsvalue.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\212\ <T3>See </T3>I.C.1., <T3>supra; See also </T3>Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C.6a (1982).Case 13_Anticompetitive Use of Section 337Alpha Corporation, a major U.S. chemical company, is the sole U.S. producerof product X, an artificial fiber with unique and valuable properties.Alpha owns a U.S. process patent covering its technology for producingX.Beta Corporation, a small Italian specialty chemical producer, has developeda new, substantially less costly process to produce X. Although Beta hasnever sold X outside of Italy, it decides to explore marketing opportunitiesin the United States. Beta's new process would enable it to sell X profitablyin the United States at a lower price than Alpha can profitably offer.Alpha, believing that Beta's imports would threaten Alpha's X sales inthe United States, files an action under section 337 of the 1930 TariffAct \213\<NOTE/> to prohibit the importation of Beta's X into the United States,alleging that Beta's process is covered by Alpha's U.S. process patent.Alpha's technical staff has advised Alpha's management that Beta's processis substantially different from and outside the scope of, Alpha's patent.Alpha's management nevertheless initiates the section 337 case, hopingthat the cost delay, and uncertainty resulting to Beta from having to defendthe proceeding will deter Beta, and ultimately others, from attemptingto compete in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\213\ 19 U.S.C. 1337a (1976).<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>Section 337 of the 1930 Tariff Act permits the U.S. International TradeCommission to order the exclusion of imported products that infringe domesticintellectual property rights or that are made abroad using a process thatis protected by a U.S. process patent.

In this case, however,Alpha does not believe that its process patent is infringed by Beta's technology.Alpha's purpose in filing the action is not to protect its process patentrights, but to exclude a rival's noninfringing product from the UnitedStates by imposing prohibitive additional costs on its sales into the UnitedStates.The Supreme Court has held that a firm's efforts to obtain action by theU.S. federal government or any state government does not violate the ShermanAct even when the result of that action would be anticompetitive.\215\<NOTE/> The <T3>Noerr-Pennington</T3> doctrine does not, however, protect petitioningactivity that in fact is a mere ``sham'' concealing ``what is nothing morethan an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships ofa competitor.''\216\<NOTE/> Alpha's conduct in filing what it believed to be a meritlessclaim appears to fall within the sham exception.

Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1966).The offense of unlawful attempt to monopolize has three elements: (i) aspecific intent to monopolize a relevant market; (ii) the use of anticompetitiveor predatory means to obtain that end; and (iii) a ``dangerous probability''that the attempt will be successful. If it appears that there is no dangerousprobability of success, the Department will not inquire further. In assessingthe probability of successful monopolization, the Department considersthe market share of the firm and concentration in the market, ease of entry,ability of existing firms to expand capacity, and other factors bearingon the likelihood that the firm allegedly engaging in the attempted monopolizationcould actually exercise the power to restrict output and raise price.On the other hand, if Alpha merely had some doubt as to whether Beta'sprocess infringed its patent when it filed the 337 action, a sham wouldnot be established even if Beta ultimately prevailed in court. Becausethe very nature of an action under section 337 is to exclude a competitors'products, such an action should not be considered to be a sham unless thepetitioner believed it to be baseless. Only then is it possible to concludethat the petitioner's only genuine motivation is to interfere directlywith the legitimate business relationships of a competitor.Case 14_International Cartel ActivitiesAlpha Corporation, a large multinational corporation incorporated in Delaware,mines X-ore abroad and processes it into X-product, which it sells in theUnited States and other countries. Alpha owns 75 percent of a subsidiarywhich it organized in Country A to operate a large X-ore mine there.Beta Corporation, which is headquartered in Country A, mines X-ore in fiveoverseas countries and sells X-ore and X-product in a number of countries,including the United States. A majority of the common stock of Beta isowned by the Delta Investment Corporation, a diversified investment companywhich is in turn majority owned and controlled by the government of CountryA.Epsilon Corporation is a European-based fruit company that sells largequantities of fruit juices through its own retail outlets located in theUnited States. Epsilon recently discovered a very large X-ore deposit onone of its overseas fruit plantations, and has been selling X-ore abroad.Beta, Epsilon, and the four other foreign X-ore producers (but not Alpha)recently attended a secret meeting in Country A at which they formed acartel and agreed on quotas and prices for all of their X-ore production.Beta is the only one of these foreign X-ore producers that sells X-oreor X-product directly to purchasers in the United States, but the othersall sell substantial amounts of X-ore to foreign brokers. The cartel memberscollectively account for a large portion of the world's X-ore production,and with Alpha would account for substantially all world X-ore production.More than 25 percent of world X-ore production is consumed in the UnitedStates. The government of A has notified Alpha that it wants Alpha to pledgeto the cartel members that it will abide by the agreed-upon quotas andprices.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>This naked, private cartel agreement among horizontal competitors to fixthe price and quantity of a product sold to U.S. consumers would be prosecuted_probablycriminally_as a clear violation of the U.S. antitrust laws unless considerationsof comity, foreign sovereign compulsion, or foreign sovereign immunitycounseled otherwise with respect to particular defendants. The only possibleeffect of the agreement would be to reduce output and raise the price ofX-ore; the agreement is unrelated to any integration of assets or operationsthat might achieve significant efficiencies. Moreover, the parties haveentered into the agreement secretly in an attempt to conceal the true natureof their activities and to defraud consumers into believing that they arebenefitting from active competition among X-ore producers. In view of thelarge percentage of world X-ore production that is sold in the United States,it seems clear that the cartel would have a direct, substantial, and reasonablyforeseeable effect on U.S. import trade, and thus the Department wouldconsider challenging it under section 1 of the Sherman Act.\218\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\218\<T3> See </T3>discussion at I.B.1., <T3>supra.</T3>For reasons explained in Part I of these Guidelines, the Department generallywill not seek to prosecute anticompetitive conduct that a foreign sovereignactually compels under circumstances in which a refusal to comply wouldgive rise to significant penalties, the foreign sovereign's command iswithin the scope of its authority under its own laws, and U.S. deferenceto the foreign sovereign's action is warranted under the circumstances.\219\<NOTE/> In this case, however, the fact that the government of Ahas importuned Alpha to abide by the cartel agreement would not excuseAlpha's participation. Although the government of A has made it clear thatit wishes Alpha to join the cartel, it has not attempted to compel Alphato do so.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\219\<T3> See </T3>I.E., <T3>supra.</T3>Due to considerations of comity, the Department might refrain from prosecutingconduct that has arisen from the decision and action of a foreign sovereigneven in the absence of strict legal compulsion.\220\<NOTE/> It does not appear that considerations of comity would leadthe Department to refrain from prosecuting the cartel in this case, however.The cartel is neither required nor contemplated by any law or articulatedeconomic policy of the government of A. The cartel also covers X-ore productionand sales that occur substantially outside of Country A. Indeed, it appearsthat the cartel's purpose and effect is not primarily to regulate the economyof Country A, but rather to raise prices to consumers in the United Statesand other markets. Given the substantial effect the cartel would have onU.S. consumers, and the lack of any connection to legitimate regulationby Country A of its economy, there does not appear to be any reason todefer to the jurisdiction of Country A and refrain from prosecuting thecartel.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\220\<T3> See </T3>discussion at I.D., <T3>supra.</T3>The fact that Beta is indirectly controlled by the government of A wouldnot immunize Beta for its participation in the cartel. Immunity from suitunder the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \221\<NOTE/> does not extend to the commercial activities of an entitycontrolled by foreign government.\222\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\221\ 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\222\ <T3>See </T3>I.C.2., <T3>supra</T3>.The facts in this case do raise questions of personal jurisdiction withregard to some of the cartel members.\223\<NOTE/> Alpha, which is a U.S. corporation, and Epsilon, which hasextensive (although unrelated) business operations in the United States,clearly are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts. Beta sellsX-ore and X-product directly in the United States, and is therefore likelyto have sufficient contacts with the United States to subject it to U.S.jurisdiction. Whether there is personal jurisdiction over the remainingforeign cartel members is less clear. Even if a potential defendant ina criminal antitrust action is outside the jurisdiction of the United States,however, the Department may file an indictment or other process againstthat individual or firm and hold it outstanding indefinitely. Moreover,if defendants possess property in the United States, under certain circumstancesthat property may be seized to induce their consent to the jurisdictionof a U.S. court.\224\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\223\ <T3>See </T3>Asahi Metal Industry Co. v.

Alphamanufactures product X in Country A, and exports a portion of its X productionto the United States. The other five X producers in Country A, which alsosell X in the United States, are all locally owned.The sales and profits of U.S. producers of X have fallen because of increasedimports of X from Country A. U.S. producers of X have been seeking U.S.legislation that would substantially curtail X imports from Country A.The government of Country A is concerned that these legislative effortsmight succeed. It therefore asks X producers in Country A to form an advisorycouncil to advise the government on how to counter the threat of U.S. importbarriers. Alpha joins the other X producers in Country A in advising thegovernment of Country A to issue an order limiting the amount of X thatmay be exported to the United States and allocating the export quota amongthe X producers in Country A in proportion to their current U.S. sales.The government of Country A does so. Violations of the quota allocationsare subject to significant sanctions by the government of Country A.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>The export restraint in this case has been imposed by the government ofCountry A. A foreign government's imposition of controls over exports byits own producers is normally considered to be a sovereign function ofthe state, and compliance with those controls is therefore normally notsubject to U.S. antitrust enforcement regardless of its effect on U.S.commerce.\2\\2\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Letter from William F.

On the facts of this case, the petitioning does not appear to be a sham.The Department would therefore not challenge Alpha's activity in joiningwith other X producers in Country A to recommend the imposition of exportrestraints.\2\\3\\0\<NOTE/> The fact that this activity occurred in the context of anadvisory council appointed by the government of Country A supports thisconclusion, but the conclusion would be the same even if Alpha and theother X producers has proposed the restraints to the government of A ontheir own initiative.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\0\ Nor would the Department challenge the activitiesof U.S. X manufacturers in seeking legislated U.S. import restrictions.Since those activities involve the petitioning of the U.S. government,the <T3>Noerr-Pennington </T3>doctrine clearly would apply.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>This case raises two issues. First, is there an agreement among the X producersin Country A? Second, would a U.S. antitrust enforcement action be appropriatein view of the involvement of the government of Country A and the requestby the U.S. government officials that the government of A act to resolvethe trade friction?<T3>Agreement. </T3>As discussed at Part I.B.1., <T3>supra, </T3>an unlawful conspiracy to restrain trade under section1 of the Sherman Act does not require an express agreement; a ``meetingof the minds'' is sufficient. As a general matter, mere parallel conduct,without more, is not enough to establish the requisite agreement. Thatis because parallel conduct by competitors in some cases can be equallyconsistent with both agreement and with independent decision-making. Aconspiracy may well be inferred from parallel conduct, however, where theparties appear to have a rational economic motive for engaging in the conspiracy(e.g., to restrict output and raise price) and it would not be in the economicself-interest of individual firms to engage in the conduct alone.\231\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\231\ Matsushita Electric Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,475 U.S. 574 (1986).This case conceivably might involve a ``hub and spoke'' conspiracy, inwhich an independent third party (the ``hub'') coordinates collusion amongcompetitors (the ``spokes''). Comity considerations aside, if the Ministerof A were acting as the coordinator for a private conspiracy among CountryA's X producers to restrict exports to the United States, the Departmentmight seek to prosecute this arrangement as an unlawful export cartel.The fact that the ``hub'' of the conspiracy is the Minister of A wouldnot insulate the private-party ``spokes'' in the conspiracy.<T3>Comity Considerations. </T3>Mere foreign government acquiescence wouldnot shield privately-imposed anticompetitive restraints clearly aimed ata U.S. market. For reasons of comity, however, the Department would notlikely challenge a voluntary export restraint that clearly arose from thedecision and official action of the government of A in response to specifictrade concerns expressed by the U.S. Government. As a matter of prosecutorialdiscretion, in deciding whether to challenge particular conduct, the Departmentwould consider the potential impact of a U.S. antitrust enforcement actionon Country A's national interests as well as on the United States' relationshipwith the government of Country A. The Department's action in a particularcase would depend on the totality of the circumstances.\232\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\232\ If the United States did decide that an antitrust actionwas appropriate under all of the circumstances, such an action would notbe subject to dismissal in the U.S. courts on comity-related grounds. TheConstitution charges the Executive Branch with responsibility for the conductof the foreign relations of the United States. It would be improper fora court to review the constitutional actions of the Executive Branch inthe case. <T3>See </T3>Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 425 (1964);Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U.S. 250 (1897).Case 17_Settling a Trade CaseThe three largest American producers of product X, which together accountfor 85 percent of domestic X production, have filed a petition under theU.S. trade laws seeking the imposition of antidumping duties on X importedfrom producers in Country A. Country A is the largest foreign source ofX sold in the United States. The U.S. Department of Commerce has preliminarilyfound dumping margins \233\<NOTE/> ranging from three to 40 percent, amounting to a weightedaverage among all respondents of 15 percent. Petitioners have continuedto argue that the margins are substantially greater.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\233\ Generally speaking, a dumping margin is the amount bywhich a foreign firm's domestic prices exceed the price of its exportsto the United States or the amount by which its export prices to the UnitedStates are below its fully-allocated cost of production, whichever is greater.The X producers in Country A meet and decide to offer to settle the casewith the U.S. X producers. A representative of the X producers' associationin Country A informs counsel for the U.S. petitioners that each X producerin Country A will raise its U.S. prices by 15 percent if the U.S. firmsagree to withdraw their petition.<ITAG tagnum="81">Discussion</ITAG>An agreement among domestic and foreign competitors to raise the priceof products imported into the United States would be per se unlawful underthe U.S. antitrust laws. The fact that the agreement purported to settlea dumping case would not constitute a defense.An agreement among foreign competitors to restrict output and/or raiseprice in response to an antidumping investigation is exempt from applicationof the antitrust laws only to the extent that the agreement is reachedand carried out strictly in accordance with the suspension agreement provisionsof the antidumping law.\234\<NOTE/> Congress has enacted detailed rules governing the effectsof a suspension on the rights and obligations of affected domestic andforeign industries and setting forth the procedures that the Departmentof Commerce must follow before it may suspend an antidumping investigation.\235\<NOTE/> The Commerce Department may suspend an antidumping investigationonly when foreign firms accounting for substantially all of the relevantimports agree with the Commerce Department that they will (i) cease exportsof the relevant product to the United States; (ii) eliminate sales madeat less than fair value (LTFV); or (iii) eliminate the injurious effectsof the exports by raising their prices to a level that does not completelyeliminate the LTFV sales.\236\<NOTE/> The Commerce Department must find the suspension agreementto be in the public interest following notice and comment by interestedparties, including consumers.\237\<NOTE/> If exporters or interested parties so request, the CommerceDepartment must continue the investigation even after it is suspended;if it ultimately is determined that the antidumping laws have not beenviolated, the suspension agreement is voided and the investigation is terminated.\238\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\234\ 19 U.S.C. 1673 et seq.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\235\ 19 U.S.C. 1673c(b)-(j).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\236\ 19 U.S.C. 1673c.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\237\ 19 U.S.C. 1673c(d), (e); 19 CFR 353.42(h).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\238\ 19 U.S.C. 1673c(g), (f)(3).An agreement by exporters with respect to the price of their exports thatmet all of the relevant statutory criteria and safeguards and was acceptedby the Commerce Department in accordance with the procedures set forthin the antidumping law would enjoy an implied antitrust exemption. No exemption,however, would extend to an agreement that was made outside or beyond thescope of the provisions of the antidumping law or to any anticompetitiveprovisions in a suspension agreement that were not necessary to complywith the antidumping law.\239\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\239\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Letter from Charles F. Rule, Acting Assistant AttorneyGeneral, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, to Mr. Makoto Kuroda,Vice-Minister for International Affairs, Ministry of International Tradeand Industry (July 30, 1986) (concluding that a suspension agreement didnot violate U.S. antitrust laws on the basis of factual representationsthat the agreement applied only to products under investigation, that itdid not require pricing above levels needed to eliminate sales below foreignmarket value, and that assigning weighted-average foreign market valuesto exporters who were not respondents in the investigation was necessaryto achieve the purpose of the antidumping law).In this case, the agreement proposed by the X producers of Country A tothe U.S. petitioners to raise their prices would not qualify for exemptionunder the antidumping law. In particular, there is no implied immunityunder the U.S. antidumping laws for private anticompetitive agreementsbetween or among U.S. and foreign producers in connection with the withdrawalof an antidumping petition. If the U.S. X producers agreed to withdrawtheir petition on the basis of a promise by their foriegn competitors toraise the price of exports to the United States, both the U.S. and foreignproducers would be subject to action under the antitrust laws. The additionalfact that certain officials of the government of Country A suggested thatX producers in Country A settle the U.S. trade case would provide no protectionsince compliance with this suggestion would not require the X producersto act outside the provisions of the antidumping law.A detailed discussion of the provisions in various U.S. trade laws thatallow agreements or other measures to restrict import competition is beyondthe scope of these Guidelines. It is important to bear in mind, however,that private anticompetitive agreements entered into outside the specificframework of U.S. trade law provisions allowing for such agreements enjoyno exemption from the antitrust laws merely because they arise in the contextof a trade dispute.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles F.
