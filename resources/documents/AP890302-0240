Brig. Gen. Bayani Fabic reported one arrest, but said the14.8-acre camp was abandoned by the time about 30 troops arrivedaboard four helicopters.   Elsewhere, the military reported that Moslem rebels killed fivetroops and that about 75 communist rebels burned three buses onTuesday in Banay-Banay village in Davao Oriental province, about 630miles southeast of Manila.   The government-run Philippines News Agency said New People's Armyrebels also set fire to three trucks there and made off with foodand other cargo.   The agency said the incident disrupted transportation in DavaoOriental for the rest of the day when other public buses refused touse the route.   No explanation was given for the attacks, but rebels oftentargeted transport companies which refuse to pay ``revolutionarytaxes.''   The military said Moslem fighters killed three militiamen in anambush Sunday on the outskirts of Isabela town in the southernisland province of Basilan. It added that a breakaway Moslem groupambushed a marine patrol Tuesday on Jolo Island, killing twotroopers.   Three Moslem groups are fighting to establish an independentnation in Islamic areas of the southern Philippines. Their rebellionruns parallel with the 20-year-old communist insurgency, which beganwhen Marcos was president.   Marcos was driven into Hawaiian exile by a popularmilitary-civilian uprising three years ago.   Fabic said raiders found 50 dummy rifles used to train guerrillasas well as first-aid kits. He said the camp included four woodenhuts, a field hospital and obstacle courses.   The general said the raid blocked rebel plans for attacks onmunicipal halls in several towns in this area, 240 miles north ofManila.   The camp was about four miles outside the Ferdinand municipaldistrict, part of the town of Marcos.   Fabic said the rebels had begun a big recruiting campaign in theprovince, which is considered a Marcos stronghold.</TEXT></DOC>
