ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Republican George Bush, with President Reagan at his side, toldadministration officials today they must persuade voters that inthe election ``what's at stake is a way of life.'' Democrat MichaelDukakis blamed rising interest rates on ``eight years of borrowingand spending, borrowing and spending.''   In New Orleans, meanwhile, the 30,000-word GOP platform wastaking shape, combining statements of party positions on domesticand foreign policy issues with sweeping attacks on Dukakis.   Bush and Reagan, at the White House, addressed about 200administration officials whom Bush said must be ``messengers ofhope'' in the campaign.   ``All the good things you've accomplished are not in focus inthe minds of the electorate,'' the vice president said. Theofficials' job, he said, would be to spread the word ofadministration successes and pave the way for extending ``theReagan revolution into the Bush era.''   Reagan, in a jovial mood, welcomed the officials ``to the WhiteHouse complex.''   ``White House complex _ that's what the Democrats have aftereight years out of office. The incredible thing is, they stillcan't take the hint,'' Reagan said.   In Springfield, Ill., Gov. Jim Thompson, one of the people onBush's list of potential running mates, said he had called the vicepresident and asked that he be removed from consideration.   ``I talked to the family about it and I now believe that at thismoment in the time of Jim Thompson and his family, it's not theright thing to do,'' Thompson told reporters.   As the 106-member platform committee began its final session inthe party's convention city, Rep. Tom Loeffler of Texas said,``There is one person who can fill the full measure of the awesomecharge of being president _ George Bush. The grim truth is, Mr.Dukakis, that the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training.''   Winding up a five-state campaign swing, Dukakis said Reaganadministration budget deficits were to blame for rising interestrates.   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes tothe door,'' Dukakis told a breakfast at the governor's mansion inRichmond, Va. ``That's what happened yesterday in the United Statesof America.''   He referred to the fact that major banks raised their primelending rate half a percentage point Thursday to 10 percent. Thatis the rate charged their largest, most credit-worthy customers.   The Dukakis campaign also announced it was going on the air inCalifornia and Texas with its first television advertisement of thegeneral election campaign.   The one-minute commercial will stress Dukakis' economic themes,his accomplishments as governor of Massachusetts, and includeexcerpts from his Democratic convention speech.   With less than a week to go before he will claim the GOPpresidential nomination in the mammoth Superdome, Bush was joiningPresident Reagan for a pre-campaign pep talk to senioradministration officials who are expected to fan out across thecountry this fall to boost Bush.   Interviewed on CBS, GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the heartof the platform ``will not change that much'' from its conservativestance of 1980 and 1984.   ``We're a conservative political party,'' he said. ``We're proudof that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''   Fahrenkopf said the document will reflect Bush's plans for ``anew direction in education, in environment, in child care.''   ``The vice president came here in an unprecedented event andspoke to this platform committee and tried to give them thatdirection, so that this really will truly be a Bush platform,'' hesaid.   Before the GOP platform committee adjourned Thursday, itfinished its draft of domestic planks. The major remaining fightwas over a Star Wars plank that called for deployment of thespace-based missile defense system ``as soon as technicallyfeasible,'' language backed by Bush. Conservatives sought a callfor ``rapid and certain'' deployment.   Bush, in Washington, told CBS he jogs and plays horseshoes tohelp relieve the pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech atnext Thursday night's convention session. ``I'm no William JenningsBryan and I think it'll go OK,'' he said in a reference to theDemocratic politician and orator from the turn of the century.   The Bush campaign leaked private polling data that said SenateRepublican leder Bob Dole helped Bush more than other potentialrunning mates, but by a margin not considered very significant.   A campaign source said the Kansas senator and former rival forthe nomination added ``a little bit, but not enough to make much ofa difference.''   The data from Bush's chief pollster Robert Teeter were describedas all but complete.   Three national polls released Thursday showed Dukakis'post-convention surge had crested. Dukakis' 18-point lead the weekafter the Democratic convention shrank to 14 points in an NBCNews-Wall Street Journal survey conduced Aug. 5-8. A CNN-USA Todaypoll the same Aug. 5-8 period gave Dukakis a 12-point lead, while aBusiness Week poll done Aug. 4-9 put the two candidates in a deadheat.   All three of the polls placed support for Dukakis in the 50percent range, while support for Bush ranged from 36 percent to 45percent.   The margins of error were three percentage points either way ineach poll.</TEXT></DOC>
