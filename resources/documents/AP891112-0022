The Moslem Brotherhood captured two seats in this half-Christianhilltop city of 95,000 people, where church spires and mosqueminarets dot the skyline.   To the consternation of many Christians, the third seat was wonby Dr. Saad Haddadin, a Christian who campaigned under the slogan``Islam is the Solution.'' He denies receiving Brotherhood support.   Moslem activists captured at least 34 of the 80 Parliament seatsin Wednesday's election.   Christians make up only about 6 percent of Jordan's 3 millionpeople, but their rights of worship and their customs traditionallyhave been protected.   Christian women in Western dress, Orthodox priests in blackrobes, liquor stores and ancient churches are common sights in thesteep, narrow streets of Madaba, 25 miles southwest of the capitalAmman.   On a nearby ridge to the west is Mount Nebo, where the Biblesays Moses first saw the promised land, and where he was buried.   Under Jordan's election system, Madaba has one of the nineParliament seats reserved for Christians, and 12 candidatescontested it.   As a result, the Christian vote was split a dozen ways. Haddadincaptured the seat by winning Moslem votes with the tacit support ofthe Brotherhood.   ``He was the weakest candidate, but he won because of hisalliance with the Brotherhood,'' said engineer Aouni Twal, aChristian. ``Our Jesus, he said a little bit of wine is not bad.But this Dr. Saad, he refuses to say he won't ban alcohol.''   Election banners stretched above Madaba streets proclaimed``Islam is the Solution, Vote for Dr. Saad Haddadin,'' copying theBrotherhood's nationwide slogan. But the winner denied they backedhim.   ``Since I am a Christian, I cannot be with the Brotherhood andthey would never accept me,'' Haddadin, 41, said as he receivedcongratulations from well-wishers in the nearby village of Main.   Although asked several times, he refused to say specificallywhether he supported Islamists' demands for banning alcohol, formore sexual segregation and the introduction of strict MoslemSharia law.   ``Everything that is good for my country, I am the first one tosupport it,'' he said.   Asked if he thought the Christian community in Madaba wouldaccept the introduction of Moslem Sharia law, he said: ``I don'tknow. I cannot say.''   Middle-class Christians in Amman worry that the Brotherhoodcould increase its influence in the Education Ministry to imposemore Islamic teaching and Islamic dress codes, including some formof veiling for women.   In what was seen as a move to reassure Christians, King Husseinvowed in a post-election news conference that ``the rights of allJordanians are sacred, and they are rights that will not beaffected.''   Although many Christians were visibly nervous following thefundamentalists' strong showing in the first nationwide ballot in22 years, some cautioned against assuming there would be radicalchange.   ``As a Christian from the Middle East I have no fears whatsoverof genuine Islam,'' said Rami Khoury, a political observer andformer editor of the English-language Jordan Times.   ``What we should be careful of are distorted or exaggeratedsentiments that impose restrictions reflecting social traditionsrather than religious dictates.''</TEXT></DOC>
