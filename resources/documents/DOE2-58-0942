The both sides of impermeable partition are considered tohave continuity in heat flux and temperatures. The governing equationsare solved with aid of the SADI procedure. Parametric studies of theeffects of the partition and Rayleigh number on the fluid flow and temperaturefields have been performed. Results show that the location of the partitionand Rayleigh number have a significant influence on the flow and heattransfer characteristics.</TEXT></DOC>
