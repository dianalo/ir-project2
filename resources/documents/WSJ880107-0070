The layoffs are part of a previously announced plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from this year's budget.    Senior Merrill Lynch officials said they aren't sure yet how many people will be laid off or how much the firm will save from the cost-paring moves. The total number of layoffs &quot;could be 1,000 (people), it could be 2,000, it could be 3,000,&quot; said one senior official.    The official said the layoffs won't be as high as 6,000, a figure that floated through some Merrill departments yesterday. The official added, though, &quot;We don't know yet what the consequences of this (cost-cutting) program are going to be.&quot;    Merrill Lynch, with 47,000 employees, is the nation's largest securities firm.    The first wave of layoffs began Monday, when about 130 employees were laid off at the firm's data processing center in Somerset, N.J. The center employs about 2,400 people. Another 100 employees were laid off yesterday at Merrill's headquarters building. The cuts involved the securities research and economics departments, and one of the firm's libraries, which was closed, officials said.    A Merrill Lynch spokesman declined to comment on the number of employees laid off so far. He also declined to estimate the number of employees who will eventually be let go.    Merrill Lynch officials said the layoffs will probably take place on a daily basis for the next couple of weeks. Some departments have been told to cut at least 10% from their compensation costs, but other departments, such as commercial paper, will likely be hiring, the officials said. Merrill officials said department heads have been given leeway to decide how many people they need to lay off to reach their budget targets.    Merrill Lynch's cost-slashing, part of a general retrenchment on Wall Street spurred by the market crash and other business setbacks last year, also involves salary freezes, and bonus and commission cutbacks. Merrill officials previously said the plan was aimed at cutting 10%, or as much as $370 million, from companywide compensation costs, but senior Merrill officials yesterday said they hope to be able to make a more precise estimate of the savings at the end of the month.    The firm said laid-off employees will continue to receive salary, medical and pension benefits for between four weeks and three years after they are let go, depending on years of service and position in the firm.    Laid-off clerical employees with less than one year of service will be paid for four weeks, while senior managers with 30 years service will continue to receive their salary and benefits for three years after they are laid off, Merrill said.    Many firms have already announced large-scale layoffs. E.F. Hutton Group Inc., which had about 18,000 employees, is expected to lose as many as 6,000 of them as a result of its planned merger with Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
