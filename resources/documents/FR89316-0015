We wouldquarantine areas where Varroa mites have been detected. Further, becausehoneybees are routinely shipped from those areas known to be infested tobeekeepers in the other states of the United States, we have reason tobelieve that Varroa-infested honeybees may be in states in which they havenot been detected. We would therefore quarantine all states that have notconducted Varroa mite detection surveys. This action would make possiblethe identification and subsequent containment of Varroa mite infestations.To retard the interstate spread of Varroa mites from quarantined areas,we would restrict the interstate movement of honeybees and articles usedin conjunction with honeybees, which are identified as ``regulated articles,''from quarantined areas. The Varroa mite, <T3>Varroa jacobsoni </T3>(Oudemans), is a parasite of honeybees. Varroamites (referred to below as Varroa) invade colonies of honeybees, weakeningthe component honeybees and reducing their ability to pollinate plantsand produce honey. Because Varroa multiply quickly, a beekeeper may failto notice their presence until serious damage has been done. Varroa was first detected in the United States in a Wisconsin apiary inSeptember 1987. By April 1988 Varroa infestations had been confirmed inan additional twelve states. Between September 1987 and April 1988, theAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), advised by the AgriculturalResearch Service (ARS) of the United States Department of Agriculture,considered the options available to the Department. Data collected in countrieswhere chemicals have been used to treat mite-infested bees, including Germany,France, and Israel, resulted in our decision to focus on chemical treatmentas the most viable option for retarding the spread of Varroa. The decision to pursue the chemical-treatment option required that testsbe conducted on Varroa-infested honeybees in the United States. Treatmentsrecommended by foreign experts would, we knew, require some degree of modificationand adaptation. The Agricultural Research Service's preliminary tests revealedunacceptably high mortality rates for honeybees in treated colonies, confirmingthe need for environmentally conditioned research to reduce that mortalityrate to the point that Departmental scientists could support regulatorytreatments for U.S. honeybees. As pressing as the need for treatment techniqueswas the seasonal need for healthy honeybees in 1988. To avert what threatenedto become a disaster, beekeepers and the grower groups who constitute theirconstituency sought an urgent solution to the Varroa emergency. They soughtfederal action regulating the interstate movement of bees by spring. Springimplementation would make it possible for honey production and crop pollinationto proceed with minimal disruption to the agricultural sector of the UnitedStates. On April 11, 1988, we published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>an interim rule that, effective April 6, 1988,added Varroa Mite regulations to the ``Domestic Quarantine Notices'' inTitle 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (53 FR 11825-11830, Docket No.87-140). Within a month we found it necessary to rescind those regulations,which we did in an interim rule effective May 6, 1988 and published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 10, 1988 (53 FR 16536-16538, Docket No.88-082). As we explained at that time and in our affirmation of that interimrule on September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35425-35426, Docket No. 88-129), theVarroa Mite regulations proved unworkable. The comments we received from federal and state officials, beekeepers,growers, and researchers acknowledged the ineffectiveness of the VarroaMite regulations implemented in April 1988. Many of the commenters exhortedus to convene representatives of the interested parties likely to be affectedby any Varroa Mite regulations, certain that, working together, those representativescould improve upon the original regulations. As a result, on the basisof the notice of intent to establish a committee published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 8, 1988 (53 FR 45134-45135), we formedthe Varroa Mite Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (the Committee).Committee membership was determined by the ability of each participantto represent interests compatible, if not identical, with his/her own.The Committee included representatives of beekeeping organizations, migratorybeekeepers, grower groups, related industry groups, state agencies, andthe federal government. The Varroa Mite Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee met in two publicsessions: November 30 through December 2, 1988, and January 5 through January6, 1989 (meeting notices were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>November 10, 1988, 53 FR 45484, Docket No. 88-165and December 19, 1988, 53 FR 50972, Docket No. 88-200, respectively). TheCommittee formally recognized the provisional nature of all discussions,given the status of Varroa research in the United States. In research terms,one or two years amount to a very short time, so that, despite the concentratedefforts of the Agricultural Research Service and other researchers, somediscussions would have to be premised on inconclusive data. Accepting theinevitable limitations of any regulations drafted under such conditions,the Committee recommended that the Department sponsor more Varroa research;agreed to assist in data gathering; and proceeded with negotiations. Thenegotiated rulemaking sessions that ensued focused on a list of key issuesidentified by the Committee members. Those key issues translated into agendaitems for the Committee. Each was exhaustively discussed. Many issues wererevised, tabled, revived, and reconstituted as discussions proceeded sothat, after much give and take, the Committee had reached consensus onthe terms of a regulation acceptable to all of them. While the Committee agreed to sanction the randomly monitored but otherwiseunrestrained movement of hives moving interstate under a transit visa,we propose to set infestation-level thresholds for hives moving interstate.Based on current research, the treatment-triggering threshold would be(1) an average of at least 50 Varroa per hive monitored, or (2) at least200 Varroa in a single hive. If randomly monitored hives are found to exceedthose thresholds, all the hives moving interstate under the transit visawould require treatment in order to continue the interstate movement. (Themethodology for random monitoring [sampling] is discussed under ``Surveys,''below.) The Committee stipulated that the terms of their agreement accorded withexisting data, and that their consensus agreement was contingent on thatfact. With new and better data and technological advances, review of theproposed federal program will be essential. Experience and data evolvingfrom implementation of the proposed regulation would doubtless warrantsome revision of Varroa Mite regulations within its first year. Along withthe Committee, we expect this, and intend to review the Varroa situationwhen the interstate movement of honeybees required for honey productionand pollination has concluded for 1989. The regulations we are proposing address agricultural needs as identifiedfor us by the Varroa Mite Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee. Basedon the Committee's recommendations, informed by experience and the bestresearch available from the Agricultural Research Service and other researchers,we are proposing federal regulations capable of retarding the interstatespread of Varroa. An explanation of the provisions of the proposed Varroaregulations follows. Restrictions (Section 301.92) Honeybees and other articles defined as ``regulated articles'' could bemoved interstate from or through quarantined areas only in accordance withthe proposed regulations. Definitions (Section 301.92-1) To present the regulations in terms expressing their intended meaning,including definitions prevailing in apicultural literature, we would includea list of definitions in andSection; 301.92-1.We propose to define ``infestation'' to mean any colony in which a Varroamite has been detected, except hives accompanied by a valid transit visa.This exception would be necessary to prevent the quarantining of a stateor portion of a state because of the presence of Varroa in hives movinginterstate in accordance with this proposed subpart. ``Package honeybees'' would be defined as a colony of honeybees weighingthree pounds or less in a screened cage. This weight limitation would benecessary to ensure the efficacy of the Apistan<T4>#</T4> treatment that would be required for the interstate movementof package honeybees. The screened cage is necessary in order to reducemortality in transit. Surveys (andSection; 301.92-2) Because honeybee queens and packages are routinely shipped to hobbyistsand professional beekeepers and researchers in the United States from stateswhere Varroa have been detected, and because migratory beekeepers meetthe needs of growers of different crops in different states at differenttimes of the year by routinely moving their honeybees interstate from andthrough states where Varroa have been detected, we have reason to believethat Varroa-infested honeybees may be present in areas where they havenot yet been detected. We therefore propose to restrict the interstatemovement of honeybees from states that have not conducted surveys for Varroa.Each of these proposed surveys uses the same system, based on the randomselection of hives. For any of these surveys to be statistically valid,the selection of hives must be ``random'' in the technical sense used bystatisticians. This technical definition of ``random'' means that we knowthe probability of selection of each hive in a state (or regulated area,or apiary). We can achieve this certainty about probability by using arandom numbers table. In order to use the random numbers table, an inspectormust first determine the sampling universe (the honeybee population inthe area being surveyed_a state, a regulated area, or an apiary). Staterecords of registered beekeepers, along with state and local personnel,would be used to identify the names, locations, and numbers of colonieskept by beekeepers in the area to be surveyed. Having determined the samplinguniverse, the inspector would assign a block of consecutive numbers, onenumber per hive, to each apiary included in the sampling universe. Thetable provided in andSection; 301.92-2(f) of this subpart would then be usedto determine the number of hives to sample in the survey, and the inspectorwould survey only those hives. On this basis we would be able to make predictionswith verifiable and quantifiable levels of confidence. The Varroa Mite Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee recommended thatwe design a survey that could detect an infestation level of at least onepercent, assuming a confidence level of 95 percent. In other words, theywere willing to accept a survey that could, 95 times out of 100, detectone infested hive if the state (or regulated area, or apiary) were infestedat a level of at least one percent. Time, money, and labor constraintsmade impractical a survey assuming a confidence level of 100 percent oranything above the 95-percent level; a confidence level less than 95 percentrepresented more risk than the Committee could accept. We accepted theCommittee's recommendation. The proposed regulations provide for five surveys. Each survey appliesthe same sampling method on a different scale. A state would be quarantined unless a state detection survey were conductedin the following manner, and detected no Varroa. First, to accurately determinewhether the state should be quarantined because of the presence of Varroa,a random sample of hives would be selected from the statewide populationof hives. The results of the state detection survey would determine thenecessity of other surveys. If the state detection survey results werenegative, this would indicate, with 95 percent certainty, that the statewas not infested at a level greater than one percent. The state would beapparently free of Varroa. That being the case, the state would not bequarantined. If, however, the state detection survey were to detect Varroa, the infestedstate would be quarantined, and federal Varroa Mite regulations would applyto the interstate movement of all regulated articles from that state, toretard the interstate spread of Varroa. The state may conduct a state delimiting survey to reduce the area designatedas quarantined. This would be performed in the same manner as the statedetection survey, except that apiaries where Varroa have been detectedand previously surveyed hives would be excluded from the sampling universe.The infested apiaries would be excluded from the state delimiting surveybecause these apiaries would be included in areas known to be infestedand will be in regulated areas. (Regulated areas are discussed below.)The previously surveyed hives would be excluded because they have beenfound to be negative. This sampling process would be repeated until statedelimiting survey results proved negative. Random sampling would again be used in the regulated area delimiting survey,which would establish the boundaries of each regulated area. With hivesin the infested apiary eliminated from the sampling universe, this surveywould include all other hives within two miles of the infested apiary.If no more Varroa were detected, the regulated area would consist of theinfested apiary and a buffer zone radiating out for at least two milesin every direction. (See discussion of buffer zones under ``QuarantinedAreas,'' below.) If the regulated area delimiting survey did detect Varroa,this sampling process would be repeated until survey results proved negative.The boundaries of the regulated area would be redrawn to encompass eachinfested apiary and a buffer zone, as described above. A person would be able to move hives from a quarantined area without treatmentonly when the results of an apiary survey were negative. The sampling method,the confidence level, and the statistical validity of this survey wouldbe the same. If the apiary survey detected Varroa, treatment would be requiredfor the apiary and the packages or hives being moved interstate. AgriculturalResearch Service scientists have told us that treatment of hives in anapiary should remain effective for 45 days; for that reason, we proposeto require that surveys of apiaries routinely moving package honeybeesinterstate be conducted every 45 days. If the apiary survey detected noVarroa, hives moving interstate under a transit visa would not requiretreatment. Honeybees for packaging, however, would require treatment inaccordance with paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(7) of andSection; 301.92-10,but hives in that point of origin apiary would not have to be treated.We would require this precautionary treatment of package honeybees because,although the apiary survey does not confirm with 100 percent confidencethe apiary's freedom from Varroa, Agricultural Research Service scientistshave advised us that by treating package honeybees taken from hives withnondetectable levels of Varroa we come close to eliminating the pest risk.The fifth category of survey would release an area from quarantine. Atleast six months after the most recent detection of Varroa, a quarantinedarea could be resurveyed, using the same random sampling method as hadbeen used to designate the area as ``quarantined.'' If this survey detectedno Varroa, the area would be apparently free of Varroa, and would be removedfrom the list of quarantined areas. The minimum quarantine period of sixmonths would be necessary to ensure that an infestation could, in the timebetween surveys, increase to a detectable level.  Quarantined Areas (andSection; 301.92-3) We would quarantine states that for any reason lack Varroa survey dataindicating that they are apparently free of Varroa. Absent evidence tothe contrary, the routine shipment of honeybees interstate from statesknown to be infested to states that have not conducted Varroa surveys leadsus to believe Varroa are present in those states. By taking this precautionaryaction we would retard the interstate spread of Varroa. Less than an entire state would be quarantined if we determined that: (1)The state-imposed restrictions on intrastate movement of regulated articleswere equivalent to those that our regulations impose on the interstatemovement of regulated articles; and (2) delimiting a regulated area withina state would suffice to contain the interstate spread of Varroa. A delimitedarea meeting these criteria would be determined to be a ``regulated area.''Each regulated area would encompass an area at least as great as the apiarywith the infestation and its buffer zone. This buffer zone would comprisethe area around the infested apiary into which infested honeybees may haveranged. The boundaries of the buffer zone are based on the foraging rangeof honeybees. In general, the natural foraging range is two miles. We would,therefore, require that buffer zone boundaries at all points measure twomiles from the closest apiary with an infestation. We would expect someregulated areas to encompass areas exceeding the minimum prescribed inthe regulations, in order to establish identifiable boundaries. These specificgeographic boundaries of quarantined areas would appear in the regulations.Additionally, proposed andSection; 301.92-3 provides for the temporary quarantiningof an area without publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when immediate emergency action is warranted.Otherwise, the spread of Varroa could occur before publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of a document adding that area to the list ofquarantined areas. Proposed andSection; 301.92-3 also provides for releasefrom quarantine, in accordance with the proposed survey provisions of andSection;301.92-2(e).Conditions Governing the Interstate Movement of Regulated Articles fromQuarantined Areas (andSection;andSection; 301.92-4 Through 301.92-11) Proposed andSection; 301.92-4 provides requirements for regulated articlesbeing moved interstate from quarantined areas. Whether the document requiredwould be a certificate, limited permit, transit visa, or Departmental permitwould depend on the regulated article and the extent or purpose of theplanned interstate movement. A certificate would be issued when honeybeespresented no pest risk before interstate movement. A limited permit ortransit visa would be issued when honeybees presenting a minimal risk ofspreading Varroa could safely be moved interstate. Because research conductedby the Agricultural Research Service confirms the 100 percent effectivenessof treatments for queens and their attendants only, we could issue certificatesfor those honeybees only. Because of the risk associated with package beesand hives, we would issue only limited permits or transit visas for honeybeesin those categories. We would allow the United States Department of Agriculture to move regulatedarticles interstate for experimental or scientific purposes with a Departmentalpermit issued by the Administrator, containing conditions which would retardthe interstate spread of Varroa. This regulation would also require thatthe regulated article moved under a Departmental permit be identified witha tag or label bearing the number of the Departmental permit. This is toensure that the regulated article is in fact one for which a Departmentalpermit has been issued. We would allow honeybees to move interstate through a quarantined areawithout certificates, limited permits, or transit visas if the point oforigin were outside a quarantined area, in accordance with certain proposedconditions. First, the accompanying waybill would have to identify thepoint of origin. This would provide assurance that the honeybees originatedoutside the quarantined area. Second, while in the quarantined area betweensunrise and sunset, the honeybees would have to be moved in an enclosedvehicle or completely covered with a mesh impermeable to honeybees, andthe vehicle must move through the quarantined area without stopping, exceptfor refueling or traffic conditions, such as traffic lights, rest stops,emergency repairs, and stop signs. Honeybees moved through a quarantinedarea in darkness (between sunset and sunrise, when honeybees do not fly)would require only the accompanying waybill, because the risk of the spreadof Varroa to honeybees moving through a quarantined area during darknessis negligible. If hives monitored during interstate movement were foundto have an average of at least 50 Varroa per hive or 200 or more Varroain a single hive, they would be infested at a level higher than could beaccepted to retard the interstate spread of Varroa. At this treatment-triggeringthreshold, all hives in the shipment would have to be treated in accordancewith andSection; 301.92-10(c) before interstate movement could resume. Proposed andSection; 301.92-5(a) specifies the conditions under which certificateswould be issued for the interstate movement of a queen and attendant honeybees.The inspector or complier would issue a certificate upon determining thata queen and attendant honeybees had been treated in accordance with theregulations. The certificate would signify that such honeybees do not posea risk of the interstate spread of Varroa and are, therefore, eligibleto be moved interstate. Proposed andSection; 301.92-5(b) specifies the conditions under which limitedpermits would be issued. The inspector or complier would issue a limitedpermit upon determining that package bees had been treated in accordancewith the regulations. All package bees, including those from a point-of-originapiary surveyed and found to be apparently Varroa-free, would have to betreated in accordance with andSection; 301.92-10(b) of the regulations. Packagebees from an infested point-of-origin apiary, or an apiary that had notbeen surveyed, would have to be treated twice. First, all hives, includingthose hives in which the package bees are located, would be treated inaccordance with proposed andSection; 301.92-10(c). Second, the package honeybeesto be moved interstate would be treated as prescribed in proposed andSection;301.92-10(b). According to the Agricultural Research Service, this procedurefor treating package bees cannot be guaranteed to eliminate the pest riskassociated with their interstate movement. However, the limited permitwould signify that the package bees have been treated in a manner whichwould retard the interstate spread of Varroa. Proposed andSection; 301.92-5(c) specifies the conditions under which wewould issue transit visas. The inspector would issue a transit visa upondetermining that a hive had been surveyed in accordance with andSection;301.92-2(d) and found to be apparently free of Varroa, or upon determiningthat a hive had been treated in accordance with andSection; 301.92-10(c)of the regulations. To ensure that the person being issued a transit visawould be prepared for the monitoring and possible treatment of his/herhives during the interstate movement authorized by the transit visa, theinspector would inform the person of the requirement that hives be subjectto monitoring as a condition of interstate movement. The person being issueda transit visa would assume responsibility for contacting an inspectorin each destination state on the interstate itinerary at least 48 hoursbefore his/her hives' arrival in that state. This would ensure that theinspector in each state would receive updated information either confirmingor revising the time specified on the transit visa, preventing delays thatcould otherwise interfere with the interstate movement of hives. Proposed andSection; 301.92-5 (a) and (b) provide, respectively, for theissuance of certificates and limited permits by an inspector or any person,known as a complier, who has entered into and is operating under a complianceagreement with us, and who has determined that his/her honeybees meet therequirements for interstate movement provided for queens and package bees.Because the prospective monitoring of treated hives being moved interstatecould be integral to the success of our proposed regulatory program, wemust ensure that inspectors in all destination states listed on a transitvisa receive the earliest possible notification that the transit visa hasbeen issued, and that they could therefore expect the bees to arrive atthe time estimated on the transit visa. The inspector issuing the transitvisa would be responsible for distributing copies of the document to inspectorsin each destination state immediately upon issuance. For that reason, wepropose no provision for the issuance of transit visas by compliers. Proposed andSection; 301.92-5(d) provides for the withdrawal of a certificate,limited permit, or transit visa by an inspector who finds that the personto whom the document is issued has not complied with the regulations. Theinspector would, in that case, notify this person of the reasons for the cancellation. The inspector's decision could be appealed, and the personwhose document had been withdrawn could request a hearing if any factswere in dispute. Proposed andSection; 301.92-6 provides for the issuance and cancellationof compliance agreements. Compliance agreements serve a dual purpose: Forthe public, convenience; for the government, conservation of limited resources.We are pleased to enter into compliance agreements with persons who areable to treat regulated articles in accordance with the regulations, andwho can be relied upon to consistently comply with the regulations. Personsinterested in entering into compliance agreements could do so by contactinga local office of Plant Protection and Quarantine. In signing a compliance agreement, a complier acknowledges that he/sheunderstands and is committed to complying with the requirements of theregulations. An inspector supervising enforcement of a compliance agreement, findingthat a complier had violated any provision of the regulations, could cancelthe agreement. The inspector would, in that case, notify the complier ofthe reasons for the cancellation, and offer an opportunity for a hearingif any facts were in dispute.Proposed andSection; 301.92-7 provides that a certificate or limited permitbe attached to the regulated article, to the container of the regulatedarticle, or to the accompanying waybill; a transit visa must be attachedto the waybill accompanying the hive. Once attached, the certificate, limitedpermit, or transit visa could not be removed at any point during the interstatemovement of the regulated article. The carrier would be required to givethe certificate, limited permit, or transit visa to the consignee at thefinal destination point. The consignee would then be required to keep thewaybill and certificate, limited permit, or transit visa available forinspection and copying by an inspector for two years. As a further safeguard,we would require that compliers forward to the local office of Plant Protectionand Quarantine copies of all certificates and limited permits issued, atleast once a week. This would make it possible for us to track and monitorqueen and package bees shipped interstate. Proposed andSection; 301.92-8 provides that any person requiring the servicesof an inspector for treatment or survey must contact the local office ofthe inspector to arrange for those services at least 14 days before theplanned starting date of the treatment or survey. This would provide theinspector with sufficient time to schedule treatment or survey. Proposed andSection; 301.92-9 states that, as a matter of policy, we providethe services of an inspector without charge to the public during normalbusiness hours, that is, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,except holidays. We would not, however, be responsible for other costsor charges incurred in connection with the survey or treatment of regulatedarticles. Proposed andSection; 301.92-10 sets forth the treatments required beforeregulated articles can be moved interstate. The Agricultural Research Servicehas found that, while not perfect, these treatments are the best availablewith current technology. The Apistan treatment for queens is 100 percenteffective in killing Varroa. For package bees and hives, however, the Apistantreatment reduces, but does not always vanquish, the infestation. We wouldallow honeybees to move interstate from quarantined areas only after theyhad been treated in accordance with the applicable provisions of andSection;301.92-10. Proposed andSection; 301.92-11 prohibits or restricts the interstate movementfrom quarantined areas of regulated articles not subject to treatment:brood combs with live brood, except as part of a colony moving under atransit visa; pollen for bee food; and all other regulated articles. Varroacan survive, even when the honeybees serving as their hosts are dead, forup to seven days. The measures prescribed in this section would ensurethat no regulated article for which Apistans is ineffective could, whilea pest risk, move interstate. Proposed andSection; 301.92-12 would provide (in the final rule) a toll-freetelephone number available to persons in extraordinary circumstances, havingdifficulty moving regulated articles interstate in compliance with theregulations. We would establish toll-free numbers in each of Plant Protectionand Quarantine's four regions; a person needing help should contact theregional office covering the destination state. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Period </ITAG>Varroa have spread rapidly through the United States since they were firstdiscovered here in September 1987. With every new interception of Varroa,it grows more and more likely that infested honeybees have, unsuspected,been responsible for spreading Varroa interstate before the pests' presencewas detected. When we first promulgated Varroa regulations, in April 1988,Varroa had infested 13 states. Now, 11 months later, the number of statesinfested or believed to be infested has climbed to thirty-five. By limitingthe public comment period on the regulations now being proposed, we makepossible the implementation of federal regulations in time for the spring1989 growing season. Any delay in the promulgation of a final rule basedon this proposal would increase the risk that Varroa will be spread acrossthe country by the hundreds of thousands of honeybees about to be movedinterstate to meet crop-pollination needs. The seasonal distribution ofqueen and package honeybees required by honey producers, hobbyists, andother beebreeders in the United States also begins in early April. To ensureour ability to promulgate Varroa regulations in time to retard the interstatespread of Varroa on a massive scale in 1989, we must be able to implementour regulations by early April. The urgency of that deadline makes it necessaryfor us to limit the public comment period to 15 days. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Based on prior surveys of the beekeeping industry, if the proposed regulationsare issued as a final rule, there may be modest impact on queen and packagebee producers, migratory beekeepers, and beekeepers who purchase queensand package bees. The industry comprises about 1,500 full-time commercial operations (300-40,000+colonies), 10,000 part-time commercial operators (25-299 colonies), and200,000 hobbyists (less than 25 colonies). All the part-time commercialoperations and at least 80% of the full-time commercial operations aresmall businesses. Fewer than 150 firms are engaged in producing queensand package bees. On an annual basis 500,000 colonies are moved interstateand 1 million queens and 500,000 packages are sold, if all these regulateditems are treated ($2-4/colony, $1.50 per package or queen), the industryimpact would be $3-4 million annually for treatment costs. The queen and package bee producers would pass on their increased costs,estimated at $2.25 million, to other beekeepers who buy their products.Migratory beekeepers who pollinate for a fee would pass on their increasedcosts, estimated at $0.5 to 1.0 million, to crop producers who requestpollination services. Migratory beekeepers who produce commercial honeywould not be able to pass on their increased costs, estimated at up to$1 million, to other producers, but could pass on costs to consumers asthe market allows. Beekeepers who do not pollinate for a fee and who donot produce queen m package bees would have to absorb their increased costsor pass them on to consumers as the market allows. The total cost for eachof these beekeepers, primarily hobbyists and some part-time operations,would be small due to the limited number of hives each maintains. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>Information collection requirements contained in this document have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB control number 0579-0088.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
