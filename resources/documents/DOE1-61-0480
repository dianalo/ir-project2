Since these tools are central in discoveringthe genetic determinants of diseases, it is in the domain of these fieldsthat genetic epidemiological tools are undergoing development. The authordiscusses the priority needs in the development of epidemiologic techniquesthat account for genetic variability.</TEXT></DOC>
