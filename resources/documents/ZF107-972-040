I. du Pont deNemours andamp; Co.'s Pension Fund Department in Wilmington, Del., agrees withChen.andP;  &quot;We are investment professionals.andP;  We are not computer professionals,&quot;he says.andP;  Madey and a fellow trader/analyst developed a collateralizedmortgage obligation model for DuPont's institutional investing using theExcel macro language.andM;In neither instance are these PC users data-processing professionals whowrite programs in C language or COBOL.andP;  Rather, they are end-user computingenthusiasts who devise their own applications by using commercially availablePC macro programming capabilities in which they incorporate the rules andmethodologies of their own business.andM;Users customizing their own PC applications generally work with familiaroff-the-shelf applications from any of a dozen or so software publishers.andO;Programming or macro language tools contained in products like Ashton-TateCorp.'s dBASE IV, Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3, Microsoft's Excel andNantucket Corp.'s Clipper database are among those considered most suitablefor this category of non-programmer PC programming.andM;Likewise, add-in packages such as Symphony from Lotus, as well as integratedsoftware like Ashton-Tate's Framework III are popular.andP;  According to users,the key to capitalizing on these macro languages is to incorporate the rulesof their own businesses into the applications they create.andM;IS managers can't say exactly how many end users are actually tailoring theirown software applications.andP;  That fact makes it even harder to gauge theapplications' value, although few are considered to be mission critical.andM;Users credit two- and sometimes three-year applications backlogs in IS forhelping foster their do-it-yourself spirit.andP;  Application backlogs being whatthey are in data centers, IS managers say it is difficult to free upresources to help individual Pc users with applications requests.andM;For example, Bank of America's Information Center, which was firstestablished in June, tries to provide its PC users with whatever resources itcan, says vice president Arnold Birenbaum, who is in charge of the center.andO;&quot;We don't quite do that [PC programming] on a widespread basis, however,&quot; headds.andM;Making the Best of ItandM;Carl Dill, vice president of Information Services at fast food colossusMcDonald's Corp. takes a similar approach.andP;  &quot;We try to help them [PC users],but it's unrealistic for DP to try and do everything for every user,&quot; hesays.andM;BoA Pc users, says Birenbaum, run the gamut from novices to those probably assophisticated as data-processing specialists.andP;  &quot;In decision support or officeautomation, we don't have people who write programming code,&quot; Birenbaumcontinues, but he notes that his organization may eventually provide someresources for those two areas.andM;Many Is directors and micro managers say the main limitation for users doingtheir own programming is a shortage of software development tools that do notrequire the talents of highly sophisticated programmers.andP;  Help could be onthe horizon, though.andP;  Tools such as code libraries and prepackaged debuggersare expected to make it easier for end users to customize software withoutwriting code.andM;Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with the financial investment house Hambrecht andamp;Quist Inc. of San Francisco, says &quot;You don't find a tremendous amount of PCprogramming tools out there, but that's changing.&quot;andP;  Lupatkin, for one,believes that users will see a bigger selection of software tools whenstructured query languages (SQL) tools become more plentiful in the next yearor two.andM;But some think that SQL will mainly appeal to those well versed inprogramming and not the casual developer.andP;  SQL-tools are likely to expand thenumber of applications developed, but probably won't appeal to the masses,Larry Heimendinger, president of Lost Angeles-based Nantucket, a LosAngeles-based database software publisher.andP;  &quot;SQL won't become a language usedon a widespread basis like, say, the capabilities of a spreadsheet.andP;  SQL isnot an intuitive [language] where a large number of users will be thatknowledgeable in its use.&quot;andM;That doesn't matter to Philip Welt, Microsoft Excel product manager, whobelieves that PC softwre will definitely become easier for amateurs to workwith in the future.andP;  &quot;The macro programming language is the key,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;The next generation of software will be [much] more customizable.andP;  It willbe a lot easier to make them [the applications created] fit into anintegrated system.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
