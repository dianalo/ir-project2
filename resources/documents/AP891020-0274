Under the revised U.S.-Japan pact, Japanese steel exports to theUnited States cannot exceed 5 percent of U.S. annual steelconsumption during the next 15 months, Michinao Takahashi, aspokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.   During the second 15-month period beginning in January 1991,Japan's quota will be 5.3 percent of annual U.S. consumption,Takahashi told a news conference.   The previous agreement gave Japan a 5.8 percent quota out of the18.4 percent of the U.S. steel market set aside for foreign steelproducers, but Japan actually exported only 4.2 percent of U.S.consumption last year, according to Japanese figures.   The earlier agreement, which expired Sept. 30, was negotiated in1984 to give U.S. steelmakers breathing space from foreigncompetition and allow them to modernize.   The new agreement prohibits Japan from providing any governmentaid to steelmakers for production, export or research, Takahashisaid.   The agreement comes after several rounds of protracted bilateralnegotiations held in Tokyo and Washington.   In a short statement, Hikaru Matsunaga, the international tradeand industry minister, described the accord as a ``real answer'' tothe current problems facing steel trade between the United Statesand Japan.   He said Japan would ``continue to make efforts to encourage thetwo countries' cooperation and prosperity, while working toward thehealthy development of the world's steel trade ... We strongly hopethat the U.S. steel industry also will make further efforts to makestructural changes and modernize.''   Friday's agreement follows a statement by U.S. President Bush inJuly that Washington was willing to negotiate a 30-month extensionof its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with itstrading partners.   In a statement released after the government announcement, JapanIron and Steel Federation Chairman Hiroshi Saito said, ``Despite adecrease in Japan's quota, we think the agreement is acceptable,considering that Japan is not treated unfairly compared to othercountries, including the 12-member European Economic Community.''The EEC's share in the U.S. market tumbled from 8 percent to 5.6percent.   In a related development Friday, Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan'sfifth-largest steel maker, announced plans to set up a second steelfactory with USX Corp., the largest U.S. steel company, in a 50-50equity partnership. The agreement is expected to be finalized byyear's end, it said.   Kobe Steel spokesman Yukinobu Yasuda said the joint factory willproduce hot-dipped galvanized steel sheet somewhere in the U.S.Midwest, primarily to supply automakers.</TEXT></DOC>
