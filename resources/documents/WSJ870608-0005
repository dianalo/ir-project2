Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEG LABORAIRLINES (AIR)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Allegis Corp. management is considering several courses of action following a restructuring proposal by pilots at its United Airlines unit, including sweetening its cash distribution offer to shareholders, a source close to the company said.    Allegis stock reacted strongly Friday to a bid late Thursday by the union representing United's pilots, heightening pressure on management to raise its $60-a-share recapitalization offer to holders. Allegis was the most active issue Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $89.875 a share, up $2.375, on volume of 2.6 million shares.    A company spokesman declined to comment on Allegis's plans. But a source close to the company said Allegis management is seeking grounds to reject the pilots' restructuring bid. Among other things, management is considering sweetening its proposal, either in cash or a combination of cash and preferred, the source said.    The company also may wait to see the results of an attempt to gain control of the Allegis board by Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that owns a 13% stake in the company.    The pilots' proposal offers Allegis shareholders at least $70 a share in cash and some securities. The plan proposes the sale of the Chicago-based company's hotels and rental-car unit, and a spinoff of the airline to employees and shareholders. It isn't clear, however, how the pilots plan to finance their proposed bid, or whether they would be willing to make a hostile offer for Allegis.    The management's anti-takeover plan entails borrowing nearly $3 billion to pay the $60-a-share cash distribution to holders while keeping the company intact.    &quot;We think that management will have to improve on their offering,&quot; said one trader who was snapping up thousands of Allegis shares Friday. &quot;The pilots have set $70 as the bottom line for the cash portion of any company recapitalization plan.&quot;    Allegis has been the subject of takeover speculation since April, when directors rejected a bid by the pilots union to buy United for $4.5 billion.    Allegis has asked for a meeting with the union's investment bankers, Lazard Freres andamp; Co., to discuss the pilots' restructuring plan, said F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the local chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. He said that no date has been set.    Meanwhile, renewed signs of labor unrest surfaced at Allegis, posing new potential obstacles to any recapitalization plan. United Airlines' biggest union, the International Association of Machinists, said it is prepared to call a strike or seek an injunction to block either the pilots' or the company's proposals.    In a letter sent Friday to Richard Ferris, Allegis's chairman, the machinists said both proposals would saddle the company with too much debt. &quot;The management and the board has lost our confidence,&quot; the letter said. Contract talks between the machinists and the company have been in mediation for several weeks.    John F. Peterpaul, the machinists' general vice president, said that if there isn't any progress soon, the machinists may declare an impasse and set a strike vote deadline. A strike by the machinists would likely block financing of any recapitalization plan by management or the pilots.    Mr. Peterpaul said Allegis hasn't responded to proposals by the machinists for partial employee stock ownership in the company, nor to a different restructuring plan proposed by the machinists that also calls for the company to spin-off non-airline assets. Allegis declined to comment on the machinist's letter and proposal.    As speculation heated up Friday, Allegis shares traded as high as $91 a share -- very near most traders' estimates of the company's breakup value -- before easing later in the day. Heavy activity by risk arbitragers contributed to turnover last week of roughly 8.7 million shares, the equivalent of about 14% of the company's shares outstanding.    The recapitalization plan by Allegis management has an indicated value of about $88 a share. Investment bankers valued the pilots' bid at about $95 a share, although some industry analysts said it could be valued higher if assets were sold off quickly.    The takeover struggle poses threats to both the pilots and Allegis management. If Allegis does propose to sweeten its recapitalization plan, it could be forced to do what it has been trying to avoid all along: sell assets. &quot;There comes a point when lenders won't want to lend without assurances that they'll be paid back quickly -- especially with an industry as prone to downturns as the travel industry,&quot; one investment banker said.    The situation could backfire on the pilots as well. If Allegis management prevails, its recapitalization plan will force it to seek major concessions from workers to help it emerge from debt.    For Coniston Partners, the pilots' proposal may be a mixed blessing. The union's bid to break up the company bolsters Coniston's endorsement of such a plan. But it also clouds the waters.    As previously reported, Allegis sued Coniston last week in a Delaware federal court, alleging Coniston had violated securities laws in connection with its planned shareholder solicitation to remove the majority of the company's directors.    &quot;From a strategic standpoint, the pilots' proposal is harmful because it creates more confusion,&quot; one investment banker said. Confusion led at least one big institutional holder to sell its 250,000 Allegis shares last week, an analyst for the firm said. &quot;It is an impossible situation,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;This has turned into an orgy of 'can you match this?'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
