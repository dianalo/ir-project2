In order to explain the above heat transfer mechanism, theflow was modeled and with regard to R113 liquid which was dropped ontoa flowing water surface, its behavior and evaporation characteristicswere investigated. The contacting form between R113 liquid and the watersurface took any one of forms of spheroidal drop, lens and continuousthin film. As the angle of incident and the flow rate of R113 liquidagainst the water surface were decreased, and as the temperature differencebetween the saturation temperature of R113 liquid and the pouring temperatureof R113 liquid as well as the water temperature was increased, the probabilityof forming the respective form above in the order of continuous thinfilm, lens and spheroidal drop was increased. The heat transfer coefficientwas decreased by several times in the above order of forms and when thetemperature difference was increased, the thickness of the liquid filmwas increased and the heat transfer coefficient was decreased. Becauseof the above synergetic effect, the heat transfer coefficient in theform of vapor column was affected to have a big negative gradient againstthe temperature difference.
