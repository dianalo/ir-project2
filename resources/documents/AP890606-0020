The Juvenile Court judge who held that the friend was not,technically, the father must take another look at the case todetermine precisely what the pre-conception agreement between thetwo was, the high court ruled Monday.   The woman had argued that she never promised to recognize herfriend as the father and that even if she had, state law specifiesthat sperm donors have no parental rights. Court papers identifiedthe couple only by initials.   Records showed that in 1985, J.R. donated semen to E.C., a womanhe had known for two years. A doctor inseminated her, and she gavebirth in 1986.   J.R. then sought a declaration he was the father, alleging thathe and E.C. had agreed in advance that he would be treated as thefather.   He also argued that the law giving sperm donors no parentalrights did not apply to unmarried women who knew the donor.   Juvenile Court Judge Morris E. Cole ruled that evidence of apre-conception agreement was irrelevant.   But Justice Anthony Vollack said that what the man and womanagreed to in advance is indeed relevant. The high court cited aCalifornia case in which a sperm donor was declared the legalfather and given visitation rights.</TEXT></DOC>
