<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0379 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple circuit which is designed to amplify, discriminate and shapepulses from photon counting photomultiplier tubes and to provide an outputsuitable for digital recording is presented. It is consisting of a differentialvideo wide-band operational amplifier of MC1733C as amplifier stage,a high speed differential comparator of UA760 as essential element ofthe discriminator and a pulse shaping circuit. This circuit may readilybe inserted between the photomultiplier and existing digital processingequipment. (author). 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
