The fleet was grounded Monday for the investigation into the June29 crash in northern Florida of a National Guard Apache. The copilotwas killed and the pilot seriously injured when the tail rotor cameoff the helicopter.

Two West Coast thrifts that lost a total of $1.4 billion indeposits during the month accounted for more than half of the netwithdrawals, the Sandamp;L industry's chief regulator said Thursday.   Total deposits in the nation's 2,934 Sandamp;Ls, after countinginterest credited to depositors' accounts, grew by $587 millionduring May to $955.2 billion.   It was the first increase since last December.   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, attributed theslightly improved deposit balances in thrift institutions to anormal seasonal resumption of savings after April withdrawals to paytaxes.   The spread between interest rates offered by money market mutualfunds and Sandamp;Ls also narrowed modestly in May, Barth said.   The May decrease in net deposits _ the 13th in a row _ was thesmallest since savers began pulling their money out of Sandamp;Ls morethan a year ago as concern about the health of the industryheightened.</TEXT><NOTE>Late Lucille Ball, Four Others Awarded Medal of Freedom</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lucille Ball has been posthumously awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedom.
