The Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald each reportedThursday that sources told them Citicorp, the nation's largest bankholding company, has submitted a preliminary proposal for acquiringand reorganizing the troubled Texas banking company, FirstRepublicBank Corp.   The Morning News said a spokesman for the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. said the agency's board was unlikely to strike adeal Friday, as had been predicted by Albert V. Casey, FirstRepublicBank chairman.   ``I imagine it would be unfruitful to wait for an announcementthis week,'' said Steve Katsanos, FDIC spokesman.   Citicorp officials had reportedly said Wednesday that they werelooking at First RepublicBank's situation. First RepublicBank'smanagement last week submitted a bid that would keep the companyindependent.   Citicorp Chairman John Reed told a Washington news conferencethat ``we are expressing an interest'' in First RepublicBank butthat ``the next step is up to the FDIC.''   Neither he nor Citicorp officials would comment further on theplan.   Last week, a 20-member team from Citicorp conducted a four-dayinspection of First RepublicBank.   Last March, First RepublicBank approached the FDIC for a federalbailout after rising losses from problem loans and largewithdrawals of deposits. The Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC havepumped billions of dollars into member banks of the state's largestsuch holding company.   First Republic reported a $1.5 billion loss in the firstquarter. Casey has predicted the institution would suffer anothersubstantial loss in the second quarter.   Citicorp is the largest bank holding company in the nation with$203 billion of assets on March 31. First Republic had assets of$28.4 billion on March 31.</TEXT></DOC>
