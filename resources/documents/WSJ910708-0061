The Memphis, Tenn., express carrier said the A300-600faircraft, which will be largely custom built, will replacesome of its older, narrow-body Boeing 727 planes. Inaddition, because the A300 carries as much as 40% more cargothan the 727, the company will be able to reduce the numberof planes it flies on some routes, Federal Express said.</LP><TEXT>   It said the new planes will improve the efficiency ofshipments to and from its four main airport hubs. &quot;If we wereto stay with smaller airplanes, it would take us to even afive- or six-hub strategy,&quot; said T. Allan McArtor, a seniorvice president. He said opening hubs would be far moreexpensive than buying more efficient aircraft.   The agreement includes 25 firm orders for A300s, 25&quot;cancellable orders,&quot; and options for 25 more planes. Termscall for Airbus, a European commercial aircraft consortium,to deliver six planes each year, beginning in early 1994.   Federal Express and Airbus officials wouldn't disclosefinancial terms of the agreement. But Kevin Murphy, ananalyst at Morgan Stanley, said Federal Express will probablypay as much as 30% less than the A300's catalog price, whichis about $85 million a plane.   Some analysts said Federal Express may have chosen Airbusrather than an American aircraft maker in part because stateproduction subsidies enable the European group to undercutU.S. prices. Federal Express may have wanted to takeadvantage of those subsidies, &quot;especially in these economictimes,&quot; said Jim Ireland, a consultant with Avmark Inc., aWashington aviation consulting firm.   A Federal Express spokesman said Airbus simply &quot;had theright plane with the right specs.&quot; He said planes from BoeingCo. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. either weren't big enough orweren't available in sufficient numbers. Spokesman for thetwo U.S. companies separately denied that those companies hadever been in the running for the Federal Express order,saying the companies don't build a plane that Federal Expresswas looking for.   Still, if Federal Express is paying substantially belowmarket price for the planes, this deal could becomeammunition in Washington's battle with the European Communityover subsidies to Airbus, said Edwin Laird, director of AirCargo Management Group, a Seattle aviation consulting firm.Just last month, the U.S. formally notified the world's maintrade watchdog that the U.S. wants bilateral talks with theEC on the subsidies, which the U.S. says total nearly $20billion.   For Airbus, the deal marks the first sale of the company'swide-body jet in a freighter configuration, although Airbushas sometimes coverted its passenger planes into freighters.&quot;This puts us into the dedicated freighter market in a largeway,&quot; said John Leahy, senior vice president for AirbusIndustrie of North America, a unit of Airbus.   In addition, Mr. Leahy said the deal should put to restindustry speculation that Airbus might quit making the A300later in this decade. &quot;It reconfirms once again the viabilityof {the plane's} design,&quot; he said.   Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France,British Aerospace PLC, Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain, and Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Germany's Daimler-BenzAG.</TEXT></DOC>
