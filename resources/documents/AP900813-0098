Until now, only 69 Soviets were allowed to reside in Americawhile pursuing business deals. Now there will be no limit.   Bush called upon Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to match hismove with ``reciprocal improvements in the climate for Americanbusiness in the U.S.S.R.''   He also cautioned the Soviets against trying to slip in spies onthe pretext of doing business.   ``This action is taken as an expression of our policy to build amore normal economic relationship with the Soviets,'' Bush said ina statement issued from his vacation home here.   It is ``consistent with our interest in expanding businesscontacts and trade with the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.   ``We have made clear to the Soviets that we retain the right toreconsider our decision should there be evidence that thisopportunity is being misused for intelligence gathering or otherinappropriate activities,'' the president said.   Bush proposed closer economic ties with the Soviets at the Maltasummit last December, and he and Gorbachev signed a trade agreementin Washington in June during their second summit.   Bush noted that the United States is eager to provide theSoviets with expertise on how to make lasting market-orientedreforms in their ailing economy.   ``Our business people in the U.S.S.R. and Soviet business peoplehere play an important role in this process. The time has come toeliminate obstacles to commercial presence in both of our countriesand to allow the number of resident business people to grow intandem with the expansion of our economic relations,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
