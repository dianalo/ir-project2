She said the crowd was one of the largest the Harlingen INSoffice had seen, and was ``reminiscent of the last days of theamnesty program'' last year when undocumented aliens, primarilyMexicans, received legal status under a landmark immigration-reformlaw.   The asylum-seeking immigrants Tuesday were taking advantage of athree-day temporary restraining order issued Monday by U.S. DistrictJudge Filemon Vela that blocks an INS procedure that kept them fromleaving the area.   Greyhound Lines tripled its normal Houston-bound passenger loadsTuesday on the morning and afternoon buses from Brownsville andHarlingen, a company spokesman said.   ``Most of the people, about 75 percent, are going to Miami,''said George Gravley, Greyhound spokesman in Dallas.   Gravley said similar heavy loads were expected for Wednesday.   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz said meanwhile that asylum-seekers whoremain in southern Texas will receive federal humanitarian relief _possibly shelter _ while their cases are decided.   Ortiz, a Democrat from Corpus Christi, joined a special JusticeDepartment team Tuesday in taking a first-hand look at theimmigrants' needs.   ``What makes it a crisis is ... this county doesn't have themoney or the infrastructure to provide the services, '' Ortiz saidTuesday after meeting with officials from the Justice Department'sCommunity Relations Service.   ``The county has been impacted by a federal policy and we oughtto do something about it,'' the congressman said.   He said the three-person Justice Department team probably wouldstay in southern Texas for two or three days observing and meetingwith local and federal officials.   Ortiz said he expected the federal team to recommend food,shelter and medical assistance. The group was unavailable forcomment, he said, explaining that the team wanted to avoid publicity.   The problem of homeless immigrants worsened here after the INS onDec. 16 adopted a procedure designed to keep asylum-seekers in thelower Rio Grande Valley during the 30 days or more it would take todecide their claims for refugee status.   Hundreds of Central Americans, no longer able to travel to theirU.S. destinations to seek asylum, began camping in empty lots andcondemned buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
