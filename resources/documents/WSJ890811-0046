Newmont, a mining concern, said the move is intended to allow it to pull at least $400 million in cash out of its investment in Peabody. The transaction also is expected to increase Peabody's debt by at least $800 million over the company's current debt of $600 million.    Newmont, which currently owns 49.97% of Peabody, said Peabody has an option to buy Equitable's stake first. Either way, however, Newmont will become Peabody's majority holder.    The purchase is expected to close in late September and then, Newmont said, it plans to recapitalize Peabody in a way that will pay Newmont cash. Newmont wants the funds to cut its own $1.2 billion in debt.    Last week, Newmont dropped a plan calling for Peabody to buy out its four shareholders other than Newmont and declare a special $425 million dividend to Newmont. Newmont then would have sold half its stake in Peabody to Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. for $75 million. The end result would have been that Newmont received $500 million in cash and Peabody took on an additional $1 billion in debt.    However, Newmont said a sympathy coal strike and new environmental regulations that might affect the power industry and coal prices made it reluctant to take so much cash out of Peabody. &quot;We're very interested in Peabody remaining healthy,&quot; a Newmont spokesman said.    As a result, Newmont said it proposed that Peabody buy out its other shareholders for cash and notes instead of all cash but that Eastern Enterprises, one of the holders, balked at the suggestion. In addition to Eastern and Equitable, Bechtel Investments Inc. and Boeing Co. also own stakes in Peabody.    Newmont said it is considering several ways to recapitalize Peabody, including a plan that calls for Peabody to again try to buy out the other shareholders and pay Newmont a dividend, or a plan that would pay a dividend to all Peabody shareholders. After the recapitalization, Newmont said it expects to reduce its stake in Peabody to less than 50%. </TEXT></DOC>
