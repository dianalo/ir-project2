Bariumexaminations were normal in two cases, abnormal but insufficient fordiagnosis in one, and sufficient to allow topographic diagnosis in one.Ultrasonography gave abnormal findings insufficient for diagnosis intwo cases and allowed topographic diagnosis in the other two cases. CTscans were abnormal but insufficient for diagnosis in one case, allowedtopographic diagnosis in the other two cases. CT scans were abnormalbut insufficient for diagnosis in one case, allowed topographic diagnosisin 3 cases, and in two of the cases permitted initial diagnosis of aconnective tissue malignancy. Due to the frequently subserosal natureof leiomyosarcoma of the stomach and of the digestive tract in general,analysis by CT is mandatory. Analysis of tumor relations with the spleen,the left kidney and the pancreas is facilitated by ultrasonography. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
