It is for the launch of AsiaSat 1 in April 1990.   China will be sending two other American-made satellites intospace in July 1991 and February 1992 for an Australian satellitecompany, Aussat, Chinese officials said.   In addition, negotiations are under way for the Chinese launchingof a second satellite from AsiaSat and a weather satellite fromSweden. AsiaSat 1 and the two Aussat satellites were made by theU.S.-based Hughes Aircraft Co.   The launchings in an unmanned rocket will provide China withmuch-needed foreign exchange and, if successful, help cement itsposition in the world of international aerospace.   Since 1984, China has launched four of its own communicationssatellites successfully. It started launching satellites in 1970 andhas had 23 successful firings and one failure.   In December, the United States agreed to allow China to launchAmerican-built communications satellites after Beijing promised itwould neither steal American satellite technology nor undercutprivate American launch companies.   China said it would limit itself to launching nine foreigncommunications satellites over the next six years.   According to some estimates, China's state-subsidized rocketindustry charges 30 to 50 percent less per launch than its Americanor European competitors.   AsiaSat 1 will be sent into orbit 21,700 miles high on a LongMarch 3 rocket from China's launching site in Xichang, Sichuanprovince. Company officials said total expenditures on AsiaSat are$120 million and they expect to start making a profit in five years.   China will use most of the satellite's 24 transponders fordomestic communications.   The launch will be AsiaSat 1's second trip in space. In 1984,under the name Westar VI, it was sent up on the American SpaceShuttle but a rocket motor malfunctioned and the satellite was notdelivered into orbit.   It was retrieved in a spectacular salvage operaton in 1985 andsold to AsiaSat, the company owned by a consortium consisting ofCable and Wireless of Britain, the state-owned China InternationalTrust and Investment Corp., and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., one of HongKong's biggest companies.</TEXT></DOC>
