It is also us who needs themarkets.''   Nazer, speaking to the Independent Petroleum Association ofAmerica, said his country is particularly interested in a healthyoil market in the United States, which last year accounted forabout one-fourth of total oil imports.   ``We are now an integral part of the United States oil market,and the return on our investment depends on its health,'' Nazersaid. One-fifth of the oil supplied by Saudi Arabia, the world'slargest oil exporter, goes to the United States, he said.   While independent, or ``high-cost, low-reserve'' producers maybe a declining part of the world oil market, Nazer said, their roleis significant.   ``Their output, and their continuing presence in the market, isessential in a situation of robust demand. And their presencebecomes all the more important in times of excess demand, which maywell be the situation in the future,'' he said.   Later, referring to independent producers in the United States,he told reporters, ``I think they should get all the incentivesthey need because I think their role in the market is extremelyimportant.''   Asked about reports that Saudi Arabia is producing 5.4 millionbarrels of oil a day, Nazer replied: ``We are sticking to our(OPEC) quota. By the way, there is a difference between productionand quota.''   He said his nation's OPEC oil quota is 5.14 million barrels aday. Nazer also said Saudi Arabia's oil reserves are estimated at252 billion barrels, but could end up being as high as 315 billionbarrels. Overall world reserves total 950 billion barrels, Nazersaid.   Nazer also said Saudi Arabia alone cannot stabilize the worldoil market.   ``Saudi Arabia believes in reasonable and stable oil priceswhich allow appropriate returns to producers. Unreasonably high orunreasonably low prices give both producers and consumersmisleading signals,'' he said.   Touting the notion of ``reciprocal security,'' Nazer said oilcustomers must know that the flow of oil and natural gas willcontinue at a reasonable price.   ``There is a need to enlarge the concept of energy security tocover not only the consumers but also the producers,'' he said.   Reciprocal security, Nazer said, is a simple equation of oilsupply and demand. ``You need the oil, we have the oil,'' he said,to a few chuckles in the audience.   Nazer declined to discuss what actions the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries might take at an upcoming Novembermeeting.   As for oil prices in the first quarter of 1990, he said, ``Idon't see how you can get lower prices with higher demand.''</TEXT></DOC>
