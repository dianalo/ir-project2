 Constitution.andP;  In addition, the Civil ServiceReform Act of 1978 protects employees who engage in specific whistle-blowingactivities.andM;Often, employees are confused about just what they can say or not say to thepublic about their jobs.andP;  Agency officials, faced with disruptions caused byemployees who have made public statements, also need to know what employeespeech is protected.andM;The First Amendment is the primary source of protection for freedom of speechfor public employees.andP;  Public workers cannot be disciplined in a way thatinfringes constitutionally protected freedom of speech.andP;  However, freedom ofspeech does have limitations.andM;If a federal employee is disciplined for making a statement and wants to filean action against the agency, he or she must show that the statementqualifies as protected speech and that the protected speech was the reasonfor the disciplinary action.andM;To determine whether a particular statement is protected, the court uses abalancing test.andP;  The threshold question is whether an employee's speech canbe characterized as an expression on a matter of public concern.andP;  Whether theemployee's statement deals with such an issue is determined by examining theentire content, form, and context of the employee's statement.andM;Speech that concerns only internal agency grievances rather than matters ofpolitical, social or other concern to the community, does not deal with amatter of public concern.andM;A balance must be made between the competing interests of the individualemployee and the public employer.andP;  The employee's interest, as a citizen, incommenting on matters of public concern, must be balanced against theinterest of the government, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency ofthe public service it performs through its employees.andM;If the court rules a particular expression addresses a public concern, agencyofficials cannot use the speech as a basis for discipline.andP;  Only if theemployee's interest in free expression is outweighed by the interest of theagency in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs is theagency justified in disciplining the employee.andM;The employer is not required to show that the efficiency of the agency'sservice actually was diminished as a result of the employee's speech.andM;If the public statement survives the balancing test and is found to beconstitutionally protected, the employee then must show the statement was themain reason for the disciplinary action.andM;The burden then shifts to the agency to prove the action was taken for areason other than the employee's exercise of free speech.andP;  If the agency canprove the action was legitimate, the disciplinary action is likely to beupheld.andM;Besides the First Amendment, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 providesprotection for whistle-blowing activities.andP;  This protection is provided forin 5 U.S.andP;  Code Section 2302(b)(8).andM;In general, it is unlawful for a federal government agency to take any actionof reprisal against an employee or applicant for an employee's disclosure ofinformation that the employee reasonably believes shows either a violation ofany law, rule, or regulation or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, anabuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to health or safety.andM;To establish a claim, an employee must show that: a protected disclosure wasmade; the accused official knew of the employee's disclosure; the adverseaction under review could have been retaliation; and, after careful balancingof the intensity of the motive against the gravity of misconduct, there was aconnection between the adverse action and the motive.andM;The First Amendment right of freedom of expression and the whistle-blowingsafeguards in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 share two themes.andM;First, for an expression to be protected, it must deal with a matter ofpublic, not private, concern.andP;  Second, the disciplinary action at issue musthave been taken against the employee because of his or her exercise ofprotected activity, nto because of a separate, legitimate reason.andM;These issues in First Amendment cases are not always easy to resolve, and thelegal principales often are difficult to apply.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
