H. Keith Florig, a radiation policy specialist atCarnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the sophisticatedelectronics used in U.S. and NATO weapon systems could make themparticularly vulnerable to attack.   ``The biggest fear is that an enemy might use high-powermicrowaves (HPM) to jam or burn out the electronic hardware uponwhich many military systems rely. Both strategic and tacticalsystems are possible targets _ missiles, re-entry vehicles,satellites, aircraft, tanks, radars, and communications andnavigation equipment,'' Florig wrote in the March issue of the IEEESpectrum, a journal published by the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers.   He observed that ``because the forces of the United States andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization depend more heavily onsensitive electronics in `smart weapons' and sophisticated radarsthan do Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces, the West could be morevulnerable to microwave weapons.''   Decisions on whether to deploy microwave weapons are stillseveral years off, Florig said.   However, the Pentagon said last year in its annual ``SovietMilitary Power'' report that the Soviet Union has completed enoughresearch that ``no significant technological obstacles stand in theway of a prototype short-range tactical RF (radio-frequency)weapon.''   Another Defense Department publication, ``The Soviet SpaceChallenge,'' issued last November, said ``the Soviets could test aground-based radio-frequency weapon capable of damaging satellitesin the 1990s.''   Florig said there are ``obvious ethical issues'' involved infurther development and deploying of microwave weapons, in view oftheir potentially fatal effects on troops.   ``HPM weapons that merely stun the nervous system temporarilyseem, like short-acting chemical agents, to be more humane thanlethal force,'' he said. ``But HPM weapons that blind, burn or bakepeople to death are likely to be viewed as an abhorrent addition tothe arsenal.''   The difference between a disabling and lethal microwave powerlevel is largly one of range, Florig said, adding that ``pulsed HPMweapons might be designed with pulse repetition rates too low toharm people but with enough peak power to burn out hardware.''   Military facilities involved in high-power microwave researchinclude Harry Diamond Laboratories in Adelphi, Md., a unit of theArmy's Electronics Research and Development Command; the NavalResearch Laboratory in Washington; the Naval Surface WeaponsCenter, Dahlgren, Va.; and the Air Force Weapons Laboratory atKirtland AFB near Albuquerque, N.M.   Research work also is being carried out at the LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif., and the SandiaNational Laboratory in Albuquerque.   John Rosado, acting director of the research and technologydivision at Harry Diamond Laboratories, told a symposium ofgovernment and industry officials last August that ``the nature ofwarfare will be completely changed by the use of these weapons.''   Devices capable of generating high-power microwaves include themagnetron and klystron, along with newer devices such as thevircator (virtual-cathode oscillator), gyrotron, free-electronlaser and beam-plasma generator. All the devices function byconverting the kinetic energy of an electron beam into theelectromagnetic energy of a microwave beam.   Florig said in a telephone interview that ``the Soviets havetraditionally been strong in certain sources like the gyrotron.They may maintain a lead in some of those areas.   ``But things are rapidly evening up, and the U.S. may currentlybe ahead in some areas. For the areas where intense computation isneeded for design, the U.S. definitely has an advantage,'' he said.   In his IEEE Spectrum article, Florig noted that the microwavegenerator itself is only a small part of any high-power weaponsystem.   ``A major challenge of HPM weapon design is to develop powersupplies that are small and light enough to be used on mobile,airborne or space platforms,'' he wrote.   At very high power levels, microwave weapons might even detonatemissile warheads, bombs or artillery shells, in addition to burningout electronic components, Florig said, while at lower intensitiesmicrowaves can trigger ``spurious signals'' that might jam ordisable electronic circuitry.   ``Several crashes of the Army's Blackhawk helicopter since 1982are thought to have resulted from radio frequency interference withtheir flight control systems when they were flying near ground- orship-based radar or communication transmitters,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
