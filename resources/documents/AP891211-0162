KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional Democrats, denouncing renewedhigh-level Bush administration contacts with China as``embarrassing kowtowing,'' vowed Monday to revive legislationprotecting Chinese students here and imposing sanctions againsttheir government.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told reportersthat Bush's decision to dispatch two leading foreign policyadvisers to Beijing over the weekend undermines hisadministration's professed support for human rights and ``sends theworst possible message at the worst possible time.''   Mitchell said Bush's move makes ``a mockery of our profession ofconcern for human rights'' and was ``inconsistent with our statedideals.''   The majority leader noted that Bush had declared in June thatthe United States could not conduct normal relations with agovernment that had reacted to weeks of pro-democracydemonstrations with a bloody crackdown.   ``Yet that is exactly what appears to be happening,'' Mitchellsaid, referring to the mission to Beijing led by National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger.   Mitchell said Bush's decision raises the question of how theadministration might react if the Soviet Union intervenedmilitarily to crackdown on democratic movements in Eastern Europeand within its own borders.   ``Will the president send his emissaries to Moscow to tell thamthat we want to do business as usual?'' Mitchell askedhypothetically. ``Or are there two standards, one for the Chineseand another for the Russians and everyone else?''   The majority leader also said he will lead efforts to overrideBush's Nov. 30 veto of legislation to permit any Chinese studentfearful of reprisal if forced to return home to remain in theUnited States beyond his visa's expiration.   Bush said then that he was directing Attorney General DickThornburgh ``to take the steps necessary to extend administrativelyto all Chinese students in the United States the same benefits''that were in the bill he was vetoing.   Separately, the House and Senate voted just before adjourningfor the year Nov. 21 to impose political and economic sanctions onthe Chinese government. But the approvals were to slightlydifferent versions of the legislation and the differences were notresolved before adjournment.   Both versions would have imposed as a matter of law sanctionsBush put in place days after the June 3 crackdown. Both measureswould permit the sanctions to be lifted if the human rightssituation in China improved.   The White House opposes that legislation, saying Bush needsflexibility in lifting the sanctions, which include a suspension offinancing for U.S. investment in China and a ban on exports toChina of military, nuclear and satellite technology.   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Asian subcommittee, said he believes Bush's veto of thevisa-extension bill will be overridden and that Congress will actquickly to revive the sanctions legislation when it returns nextmonth.   ``I believe the Congress is not in the mood to kowtow to theseChinese leaders,'' Solarz said.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, called Bush's move ``ill timed to say the least.''   At a time of major breakthroughs for democracy in EasternEurope, Bush's action sends the message that ``we care less abouthuman rights in China,'' Nunn said.   Asked about Bush's announcment that China now has promised notto sell missiles in the Middle East, Nunn noted that an identicalpromise was made several years ago to then-Secretary of DefenseFrank Carlucci.   ``If the Chinese have now promised that a second time, theobvious question is, what happened the first time?'' Nunn said.   Bush himself received a similar assurance when he visited Chinain February.</TEXT></DOC>
