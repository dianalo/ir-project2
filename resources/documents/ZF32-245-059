One week it takes an indirect stake inIngres Corp via its 10% stake in Ask Computer Systems Inc (CI No 1,509), thenext it appears to be saying that Oracle is its preferred relational databasefor the HP/UX environment (CI No 1,515).andP;  Rumours abound that the companywill ditch its own database development.andP;  Then Hewlett-Packard comes out andsays it is pulling out of its fourth generation tools (CI No 1,564).andP;  Yetwithin Hewlett's proprietary HP3000 system offerings, databases have alwaysformed part of the package.andP;  Emmet Hayes, product manager for this range,reckons that of an installed user base of nearly 45,000, 95% use Turbo Image,Hewlett-Packard's two-tier database that is designed for very fast on-linetransaction processing.andP;  Originally, Hayes admits that Hewlett did plan tosubsume TurboImage in another product to be called HPImage specially designedfor Precision Architecture, which was to be a multi-tier database, but amongother things, the users were happy with TurboImage and wanted it broughtacross to the new RISC architecture as it was.andP;  So HPImage was scrapped.andM;Rate of knotsandM;Hewlett's history with relational databases has not been such a happy one.andO;Despite the fact that AllBase SQL is a bundled product its actual user baseis negligible.andP;  However, Hayes is adamant that AllBase is being tuned at arate of knots and that version 2.2 is now as fast as TurboImage was 18 monthsago.andP;  He says that Hewlett-Packard is determined to develop the fastest SQLimplementation of a relational database for the HP3000 series.andP;  This sort oftuning will require a good deal of investment, and not all the developmentwill be done in-house.andP;  Hayes says that Hewlett-Packard will be looking forthird-party offerings for various aspects of the technology.andP;  He added thatit is possible that part of the Ingres database technology may be used.andP;  Asfor the company's withdrawal from software engineering tools, this wasbecause Hewlett-Packard could not afford the huge investment required tocontinue developing such tools.andP;  Consequently, Hewlett-Packard isconcentrating on providing HP 3000 users and third-party software developerswith a good SQL engine so that a variety of software tools can access thedatabase.andP;  To this end, Hewlett has contractual agreements with Ingres,Cognos and Infocentre and is negotiating with Oracle among others.andP;  In thisway, versions of AllBase SQL will always be compatible with the latestreleases of leading fourth generation languages.andP;  Furthermore, as Hayesexplains, this strategy does not lock users in to a single vendor's softwarestrategy, since, thanks to SQL Access a user should be able to replace thehardware and keep the software.andM;By Katy RingandM;However, Hewlett is also fully committed to TurboImage and Hayes says thatthis product will be supported into the next century.andP;  He believes that a lotof users will develop their TurboImage applications using SQL, so that theycan access multi-vendor systems.andP;  To this end, Hewlett has introduced itsTurboConnect product that enables read access into the TurboImage databaseusing SQL structures.andP;  All of which means that TurboImage users can convertto an SQL database in the future should they desire.andP;  Oracle and a number ofother third-party database vendors have expressed an interest in exploringthe TurboConnect route.andP;  Sometime in a year or so, Hayes says thatHewlett-Packard will add the K-SAM high speed index to TurboImage to make itgo faster.andP;  When it comes to the HP/UX Unix environment, Hewlett-Packard isof the public opinion that companies buying into Unix don't want to be tiedinto a vendor at any level.andP;  Consequently, AllBase SQL is not bundled in aspart of the HP/UX package.andP;  However, if market pressure mounts - in otherwords if IBM and DEC start bundling their own, as yet unannounced, databaseofferings on their Unix boxes then Hewlett-Packard will follow suit.andP;  Hayesadmits that this would upset Oracle, as will internal mutterings withinHewlett-Packard that AllBase SQL should be offered on other vendors' Unixsystems as well as the company's own.andP;  Yet, surprisingly, there are no plansto convert AllBase SQL over to run under the Domain environment on Apolloboxes.andP;  But these are all possibilities rather than realities.andP;  One puzzlingfactor in Hewlett-Packard's software strategy at present is its apparentreluctance to add system software value to its low-margin Unix systems, whichis at odds with the stated intentions of its Open Software Foundationcompetitors.andP;  While Hewlett will offer its own variant of OSF/1 it isevidently not interested in tying users into a database or softwareengineering strategy, in contrast to IBM and DEC.andM;Huge numbersandM;So how does Hewlett-Packard intend to make money out of its Unix systems? Inshort by shipping them in huge numbers - worldwide, Hewlett's Unix systemsproduced revenues of around $2,800m in the last financial year, indicatingthat sales are as strong as those of Sun Microsystems Inc - Hewlett sells farmore high-end multi-user systems than Sun.andP;  Hewlett-Packard argues that withthe same Precision Architecture manufacturing processes required for both theMPE and the Unix ranges this means that there are manufacturing economies ofscale.andP;  Furthermore, quality control is strict and most of the peripheralssold are Hewlett-Packard's own.andP;  Hayes explains that sales are also driven bystrong third-party agreements such as that with Oracle.andP;  However, Oracle isnot the preferred database for HP/UX systems, rather it is among thosethird-party partners that feature on Hewlett's Premier List, where it residesalongside companies such as Ask Computer Systems Inc's Ingres ProductsDivision, Informix Inc and Sybase Corp. Nevertheless, relationships betweenthe chief executives of Hewlett-Packard and Oracle Systems are reportedlyclose, and together the companies appear to be shifting Unix systems as ifthere were no tomorrow.andP;  Whether this relationship will overcome theincreasing presence of Ingres within Hewlett's database strategy, only timewill tell.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
